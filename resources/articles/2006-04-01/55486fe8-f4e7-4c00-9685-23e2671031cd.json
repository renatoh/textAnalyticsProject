I first heard of IM in late 1998 from a friend's child in the US. Owen was about 13, and IM was the cool, new thing the kids did when they came home from school. I got my first IM client so he could talk to me. Eight years later, I have two problems. The first is that everybody insists on using a different service, and none is interoperable. So I have to have five different accounts. But the more immediate problem is that there are two camps of IMers, for whom the \"I\" means different things. The first group, usually newcomers to the technology, think the \"I\" really does stand for \"instant\", and so they post a message, and then, increasingly irritated when they don't get an instant response, post more and more agitated follow-ups. I don't get the logic of this behaviour. If I haven't responded to the first message, isn't it most likely because I haven't seen it yet? What is this fantasy that more messages make the first one more visible? Is there any point in following up with: Hello? HELLO? Answer me!!! Or, as happened a few mornings ago, \"You can't just IM somebody and disappear. It's extremely rude.\" The person had not seen my original message for five minutes. Was I supposed to sit there watching the screen? Get real. I say the average person watches for a minute or two, then goes and does other things, checking back at increasingly long intervals. Which is what I did. Thirteen minutes elapsed between my correspondent's first response (of several) and my next glance at that window. This is rude? Because I am a mature, experienced IMer, I coaxed this person out of his aggrievement. I understand that newcomers must be tolerated and educated in the etiquette of the new subculture they've just joined. This is deliberately patronising: it's my revenge. The second group, usually experienced IMers, generally display more patience. I could, of course, ensure the immediate visibility of new messages if I set the windows to \"Always on top\". If I did that, I wouldn't have much screen space for articles in progress, research material or email. And I would resent my correspondents for constantly importuning me. A straw poll in my blog reveals that most people stop expecting immediate replies, just like we learned not to expect people to answer their mobile phones after only one ring. Sometimes, the problem with technology is the name. If they'd called it intermittent messaging, we wouldn't have these problems. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
