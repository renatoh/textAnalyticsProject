So do I. Once upon a time, Silicon Valley was the jewel in the American crown, a magnet for high IQ \u2013 and predominately male \u2013 talent from all over the world. Palo Alto was the centre of what its more delusional inhabitants regarded as the Florence of Renaissance 2.0. Parents swelled with pride when their offspring landed a job with the Googles, Facebooks and Apples of that world, where they stood a sporting chance of becoming as rich as they might have done if they had joined Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers, but without the moral odium attendant on investment backing. I mean to say, where else could you be employed by a company to which every president, prime minister and aspirant politician craved an invitation? Where else could you be part of inventing the future? But that was then and this is now. It\u2019s taken an unconscionable length of time, but the tide of approbation has turned. Tech has suddenly lost its halo. Everywhere one looks, we find groups sharpening knives for a critique or an attack on big tech. In an interesting essay in the Atlantic, for example, the commentator Alexis Madrigal identifies no fewer than 15 different groups preparing ambushes. They include angry conservatives and progressive politicians, disillusioned tech luminaries, competition lawyers, privacy advocates, European regulators, mainstream media, scholarly critics, other corporations (telecoms firms, for example, plus Oracle and other business-software companies, for example), consumer-protection organisations and, last but not least, Chinese internet companies. With enemies like these, the US tech companies are suddenly discovering that they really need some friends. Since the tech guys think they embody the future, they have little use for history. Which is a shame, since it may have some lessons for them. \u201cThere was a time,\u201d writes Madrigal, for example, \u201cwhen Americans loved and talked about the transcontinental railroads the way we loved and talked about the internet.\u201d The steel lines spanning the continental United States were once \u201cthe epitome of modernity\u201d, as the historian Richard White put it in his book, Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America. But then things changed: the public turned on the railroads. \u201cThe innovations entrepreneurs brought to the railroads \u2013 financial mechanisms, pricing innovations and political techniques \u2013 were as harmful to the public, to the republic, and even to the corporation as they were profitable to many of the innovators.\u201d Something like this lies ahead for the titans of Silicon Valley. The forces driving public disillusionment with their companies are many and varied. They include the sociopathic failure of some of the founders of these outfits to appreciate the consequences of their deployment of digital technology. Exhibit A in this regard is the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but there are many other of his ilk among his peers in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s the fact that the future that tech giants aspire to bring about no longer looks so attractive to ordinary citizens, who see their communities, jobs, societies and politics being screwed by tech giants. The companies themselves are engines of inequality, enriching tiny elites while laying waste to whole swaths of our economies. The unscrupulous ethos of the surveillance capitalism that some of them practise now looks as distasteful as the financial capitalism that brought about the banking catastrophe of 2008. And we are beginning to realise that the immense power that the valley\u2019s uber-geeks have acquired is what Stanley Baldwin memorably nailed as \u201cpower without responsibility \u2013 the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages\u201d. With hindsight, the most intriguing question is why these companies were given such a free ride for so long. One major reason is that the areas in which they most aggressively innovated were lawless, in the sense that at the time there was no applicable law that might have hindered them. So their prevailing mindset that \u201cit\u2019s easier to ask forgiveness than to seek permission\u201d was allowed to run amok. Another is that governments were so dazzled by the technology \u2013 and so paralysed by neoliberal notions of the alleged inadequacy of the state \u2013 that they just let the creative destruction rip. But the biggest problem of all was that we collectively took tech companies at their own valuation. The people who founded these outfits all maintained that they were not like the evil capitalists of old. They were cool, young, idealistic, smart and never, ever wore suits. They supported the Democrats and had mantras such as \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in their filings to regulators. What we omitted to notice was that the companies they founded were just corporations. And once they went public they did what corporations do: maximise shareholder value, come what may, avoid regulation and pay as little tax as possible. Just like tobacco companies and arms manufacturers, in fact. It has taken a long time for these pennies to drop, but better late than never.
