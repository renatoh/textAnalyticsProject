Who saw it then as the scourge of innocent parents lending a volunteering hand, a volcano of bureaucratic bombast ? It's a painfully short roll call. Marcel Berlins wrote a prescient warning piece in the Guardian. Josie Appleton wrote several for the Sunday Telegraph. The Times Education Supplement was aware of the problem. Tom Utley hit the spot for the Daily Mail, as did Philip Johnston for the Telegraph. But Fleet Street's rottweilers mainly dozed. The Mail worried about \"Broken pledges to protect children\". The People roared \"Perverts in your home: how sickos on offender register slip through net to tutor\". In the wake of Soham and in the lee of Baby P, nobody seemed to care to scrutinise 250 clauses of a law that now needs drastic refurbishment. When it came to spotting duff legislation, few did much basic reporting. So much for due press diligence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
