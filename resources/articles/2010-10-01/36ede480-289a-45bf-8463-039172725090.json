Created in 1948, this setting of Stravinsky's titular score evokes an unsettling, striking sense of period glamour through its Parisian chic costumes and sharp choreography. Evoking a very different kind of glamour is Ashley Page's Fearful Symmetries, with designs influenced by Mark Rothko and the New York abstract expressionists of the 1950s and 60s, driven by the urban energy of John Adams's score. Forming the centrepiece is a commission from San Francisco-based choreographer Val Caniparoli. A classicist with a contemporary edge, Caniparoli's work is set to two chamber scores Uzbekistan-born composer Elena Kats-Chernin. His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, Sat; Eden Court Theatre, Inverness, Fri to 9 Oct Stephen Petronio Company: I Drink The Air Before Me, London It's now 26 years since Stephen Petronio \u2013 a dynamic, beautiful dancer with the Trisha Brown company \u2013 went independent to found his own company. Back then his choreography had an enfant terrible energy and deviancy: dance that came costumed in pink corsets, set to rock music and inconography. But while his work has grown in its range of expression and deepened in structural complexity it's lost none of its energy. I Drink The Air Before Me (its title taken from The Tempest) is inspired by the elemental forces of sea, wind and storm, a piece that promises to deliver movement of ferociously turbulent activity, to tread the line between control and chaos. Featuring a special guest appearance by Petronio himself, wearing a costume designed by Cindy Sherman, the work is set to music written by New York fusion composer Nico Muhly, performed by a live band and a young people's choir. Barbican Hall, EC2, Tue, Wed Rambert Dance Company: Awakenings 2010, On tour Two works commissioned by Rambert for this autumn tour bring new choreographic voices to the company. Aletta Collins, a sharply observant storyteller and maverick choreographer of dance, opera and musicals, makes an ambitious attempt to choreograph a version of the Oliver Sacks book Awakenings. This may be a work centred around victims of sleeping sickness, but Collins is collaborating with American composer Tobias Picker and designer Miriam Buether to find drama, lyricism and emotion within this seemingly un-dancerly narrative. The other new work is by German choreographer Henrietta Horn, a revival of her 2004 work Cardoom Club which describes itself as a surreal dance revue \u2013 part funfair, part star gala, with a dash of Rio thrown in. Other works revolving on tour are Christopher Bruce's Hush, Merce Cunningham's RainForest and Siobhan Davies's The Art Of Touch.
