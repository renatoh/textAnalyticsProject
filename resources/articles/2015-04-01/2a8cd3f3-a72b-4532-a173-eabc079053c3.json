At first glance it seems an unlikely place to find the food for your dinner \u2013 but that\u2019s the idea behind urban foraging. It\u2019s a movement that\u2019s been led by some of the world\u2019s most well known chefs like Rene Redzepi at Noma in Denmark who serves rose-hip petals foraged from the countryside around Copenhagen and Ben Shewry from Melbourne\u2019s Attica where a meal could include wild native saltbrush leaves picked beach side at Ocean Grove. But foraging doesn\u2019t have to involve journeying for hours to find untouched ingredients growing in pristine wilderness. Edible weeds and plants are right under our noses in our cities\u2019 parks, bike trails and creeks. Which is lucky for Jack Gillard who runs Orange restaurant in Melbourne\u2019s Windsor. Gillard became an urban forager by necessity after Orange\u2019s former chef signed the caf\u00e9 up to host a foraging dinner for this year\u2019s Melbourne Food &amp; Wine Festival and then moved on to another role before the event. The restaurant manager had to quickly work out how to forage for himself and put an emergency call in to foraging expert Doris Pozzi. Pozzi is the author of foraging guide Edible Weeds and Garden Plants of Melbourne and taught Gillard how to source ingredients for the meal from dandelions growing in Windsor to blackberries along the Merri Creek. Gillard\u2019s new-found skills resulted in a dinner for the festival showcasing foraged ingredients in dishes like ravioli filled with feta and warrigal greens, Australia\u2019s \u201cnative spinach\u201d, foraged from Melbourne\u2019s Yarra trail. Gillard wanted to show foraged ingredients can be found in an urban environment and that foraging isn\u2019t only the domain of fine dining. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the approach to be a little more casual than some of the other foraged restaurants you may have heard of along the way,\u201d Gillard says. Compared to Noma and Attica, Gillard says Orange\u2019s menu highlights quite simple dishes. Pozzi says city dwellers can safely forage for free and healthy ingredients by sticking to some common sense rules. \u201cDon\u2019t forage in parks that look neat and tidy, forage in places that look wild,\u201d Pozzi says. Along footpaths and bikepaths Pozzi recommends moving off the paths as far as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s good to keep away from the main path and the places that councils spray pesticides,\u201d she says. Pozzi warns against relying on Google images to identify whether plants are edible. \u201cDon\u2019t try to eat something just because it looks edible \u2026 it\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d Instead Pozzi recommends starting by doing an edible weed walk with an expert. \u201cInstead of seeing a picture with one example of the plant you are seeing a whole lot of different examples at different stages of growth and in different soil situations, they can vary a lot,\u201d she says. \u201c[On a walk] you can also use your five senses you can actually touch the plant and taste the plant, smell the plant, so you are getting a much more broad spectrum feel than you would from a photo.\u201d Pozzi has seen a \u201chuge\u201d increase in interest in foraging over the past few years and sees the move to urban foraging as part of that. \u201cIt\u2019s really taken off,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a resurgence in interest and I think it comes down to a couple of different things. One of them is the whole foodie culture we\u2019ve got now, the other thing is people growing their own veggies and really getting into food at home and I think a natural extension of that is wondering \u2018Oh what are those weeds that are in my veggie patch?\u2019.\u201d It turns out the weeds can be just as nutritious and delicious as the veggies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
