From Joystiq: By all appearances, the supposed official site of Sega's cherished console has received a legitimate update, exciting loyalists that have been anticipating the system's 10-year anniversary later this year. By clicking on the question, visitors are prompted to accept a user agreement for an @user.dreamcast.com email account (apparently tied to Gmail). Applicants must supply a console serial number, email address, and password before being granted a [serial number]@dreamcast.com Gmail address. The thing is ... Sega no longer owns dreamcast.com. I'm not exactly sure why scammers would target hardcore Dreamcast fans - it just seems cruel and surely unprofitable. How many saddened, nostalgia-afflicted 128bit gamers could they have captured? Sega is apparently looking into the situation, having given up the rights to the URL some years ago. You couldn't imagine this happening to Sony could you?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
