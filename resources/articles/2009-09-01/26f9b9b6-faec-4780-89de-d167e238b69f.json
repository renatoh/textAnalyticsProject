But even common or garden offenders must now be wondering if Gordon Brown's reported reluctance for Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to \"pass away in prison\" could conceivably translate into an interest in the final days of prisoners who lack the political X-factor. Is this government, to paraphrase Mr Miliband, not \"actively seeking\" their death in prison as well? Or does this philanthropy only shine through when we're sucking up to a dictator? Even if Gordon Brown's sudden interest in prisoner welfare was no more meaningful than his subsequent concern for Susan Boyle, it cannot alter the fact that, with the release of Megrahi, we have a timely reminder that it might sometimes be right for a very sick prisoner to go home to die. Always supposing that, like Megrahi, the prisoner is fortunate enough, or young enough, to have a home, as well as a supportive tyrant, to welcome him back. It does not seem to have tempered the prime minister's sympathy that, in this case, the relevant dying person had been found guilty of one of the most monstrous crimes in history. Good news, then, for England's growing population of ailing inmates, each of whose crimes inflicted agony on fewer living people than did Megrahi's \u2013 or the Libyan authorities' \u2013 act of inhumanity. Thanks to Labour's enthusiasm for imprisonment, there are going to be more of these nameless lags than ever: prodigious numbers of frail or dying prisoners advancing, at their different speeds, towards a state of harmlessness. According to the Howard League for Penal Reform, there are already 2,265 prisoners aged over 60, of whom 129 are over 76. Last year, 94 prisoners died in our jails from natural causes. So should prisoners always be released in circumstances where, as the Scottish secretary for justice Kenny MacAskill put it (perhaps hoping to present the Megrahi release to hardliners as a kind of ethical version of capital punishment), they soon face \"a sentence imposed by a higher power\"? The divine tariff, he piously continued, \"is one that no court, in any jurisdiction, in any land, could revoke or overrule. It is terminal, final and irrevocable. He is going to die\". Stirring stuff, though you might think it a little unfair, assuming Mr MacAskill's ultimate Line Manager considers mortality a punishment rather than a route to everlasting bliss, that He plans to impose the same penalty on everyone, irrespective of their conduct. Many of the nicest people have the most horrible deaths. If MacAskill is right, and imminent death should end the state's responsibility for punishment, judicial systems could surely save themselves a good deal of trouble, not only by freeing the relevant criminals, but by not even bothering to catch them in the first place. It is not only ancient DNA cases that might be abandoned, given the limited scope for retribution. Where decrepitude also makes a mockery of deterrence and rehabilitation, what is the point of prison? Why are German lawyers still attempting, years after he was first charged, to lock up John Demjanjuk? Guilty or not of helping to murder 28,000 men women and children at the Sobibor death camp, he must have, at the age of 89, very few punishable years left in him. The same applies to the Bavarian war criminal and furniture salesman, Josef Scheungraber, who has just been convicted for his part in the execution of 10 civilians in wartime Italy. By coincidence, Scheungraber, 90, was finally imprisoned in August, just before MacAskill reminded us of the \"terminal, final and irrevocable\" sentence that awaits us all. The German court was not alone in finding natural wastage no substitute for punishment. \"The verdict strengthens the view that the long time gap in no ways diminishes the perpetrator's guilt and that age offers no legal protection for the murders,\" said Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. The centre duly deplored the Megrahi release, given that \"the life sentence originally given to this mass murder was society's way of standing up for justice and in solidarity with the innocent victims\". But what of very old, or dying English and Welsh prisoners guilty of less heinous offences? Or of prisoners with such advanced mental illness that they no longer resemble the personality who offended? A 2002 Oxford study discovered a 69-year-old inmate whose dementia was such that he had \"no recollection of his crime and no idea that he was in prison\". Yet in an English prison he remained. Other elderly inmates, though their crimes may preclude release, now find themselves serving a double sentence. Denied liberty, they are also likely to be bullied or damagingly neglected in overcrowded prisons designed to house a much smaller number of sturdy, ambulant young criminals. So long as the state, rather than the victims of crime, remains the dispenser of mercy, it will have to formulate a fairer, more sophisticated policy than the current offer, similar to Scotland's, of compassionate release for terminally sick prisoners predicted to die within three months. Where, that is, those prisoners have benefited from the kind of medical diagnosis and legal argument that was available to Megrahi. Considering that the over-60s are now the fastest-growing group in prison, thanks to a combination of longevity, later and longer sentencing, and Labour's love of the lock-up, there is astonishingly little official interest in weighing up the case for compassion for a dying or enfeebled prisoner, against compassion for his or her victims. Indeed, there is still no national strategy for the care of older prisoners, even disabled prisoners in wheelchairs: they must take their chances with the 21 year olds. Long before Megrahi qualified for compassion, the case for reform was obvious. The Prison Reform Trust argued in Doing Time, a paper published last year, that terminally ill patients should be allowed to apply for compassionate release up to 12, rather than three months, before they are expected to die, given the difficulties of assessment and since prisoners may not be moved quickly enough to prevent them expiring in jail. One inmate described the fate of a newly diagnosed cancer patient, much liked on his ward. Refused a transfer to hospital on security grounds, the sick man died within weeks, without morphine, \"in agony in his cell and all alone\". Undoubtedly, there are criminals for whom a lonely death in prison might be considered the ideal conclusion. But, somehow, one of the most prominent members of this small group has elicited a degree of formal compassion that is routinely denied, in England, to prisoners whose state of debility might actually deserve it. We must hope, when news of this injustice reaches Him that Mr MacAskill's Higher Power has something to say about it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
