It comes complete with white leather seats, tables and sockets for laptops, a shower, fresh fruit, coffee on demand and, at the end of each day, a steady supply of ice-cold beer. But the race is close and everything matters, so when word of the Lib Dems' treatment of journalists reached Labour HQ, press minders were quickly dispatched to a local supermarket to buy several crates of beer. It might have worked, had it not been for the bus driver who, having repeatedly managed to get lost at precisely the wrong time, declared that consumption of alcohol would breach health and safety rules. Some suspect the driver is not a Labour supporter. Maybe he is a Quaker? \u2022 Yes it's all Nick Clegg, for now the most popular leader since Churchill. And while the folk in yellow dream exciting dreams, one wonders what role they have pencilled in for Tariq Khan, the candidate in Birmingham Hodge Hill? He understands the local community, says the leaflet. He is being straight with them. \"We will invest in Wyre Forest's children,\" is his promise, which is fine for youngsters in Wyre Forest, an altogether leafier constituency some 30 miles away, but seems a bit tough on the little 'uns in Hodge Hill, the area he seeks to represent. Memo to candidate: when you adapt a generic leaflet, change the appropriate bits. \u2022 And a memo to the would-be prime minister, the man in blue who stands for \"change\". You can't keep imploring your constituents in Witney to do everything they can to support local businesses on a leaflet you actually had printed in Worcestershire. You did it last September with your annual report and quite a few people, including printers in west Oxfordshire, were jolly cross. We can't go on like this. Learn from your mistakes. \u2022 They already have in Belfast, where Peter Robinson's Democratic Unionist party, still reeling from the sex and property scandal visited upon them by his wife, Iris, now realises that the most important things are integrity and transparency. Unfortunate, then, that the man and woman asserting support for the party on its election posters turn out to be models whose images were obtained from an American photo agency. Thankfully, they are saintly types: Mormons from Utah. But there the good news ends, for both say they have never heard of Peter Robinson or the DUP and furthermore both tell Belfast's Sunday Life that they object to this act of appropriation. But then look at it from Robinson's point of view. Not many votes in a poster featuring Iris. \u2022 Still, in Buckingham, where the electorate must decide between many candidates \u2013 including Speaker John Bercow \u2013 they can at least take comfort from the fact that the issues are becoming clearer. Henceforth, they must focus on Nigel Farage, the talisman for Ukip. Specifically, they must answer the question raised by the Sunday Times writer AA Gill: is the wannabe MP a man best avoided in confined spaces? For he is a genial type, writes Gill, but \"he also has breath that could club a baby seal to death. Even across his desk, every time something strikes him as funny there is a draught like Carnarvon opening a pharaoh's tomb.\" The first rule of standing for parliament, asserts the columnist, \"is a toothbrush is not just for Christmas\". Ukip types blame foreign food. They would. \u2022 And finally, three cheers to the Royal Navy for setting off so quickly to rescue holidaymakers stranded by the Icelandic volcano. Four cheers even. For when the idea was first unveiled on Sunday by security minister Lord West of Spithead, there was no such contingency plan and no one at the Ministry of Defence knew what he was talking about. An occupational hazard, but there they go regardless. Makes you proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
