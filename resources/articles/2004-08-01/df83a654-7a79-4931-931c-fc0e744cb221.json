A few plaudits would thus be deducted from David Beckham, after his sharp display in the friendly against Ukraine, since the game was played in late summer. It is a calendar page that suits him, when fatigue does not drag him down to the same level as lesser players. He capered in the 3-0 win at St James' Park and even tackled boisterously. It might be unfeeling to stop short of heralding a triumphant rebirth for Beckham. He was definitely impressive, but a year ago he was also full of relish for his new life at Real Madrid and that mood eventually dwindled to the bleakness in keeping with a trophyless campaign. A guarded appreciation of him, and his entire side, should do for the time being since Ukraine's commitment receded as soon as the captain took his opening goal in the 27th minute. If a reminder were necessary, though, Beckham did demonstrate that he is a footballer of high quality. His confidence was so much on the rise that he used his left foot to curl the inswinging cross for Michael Owen to head the second goal. Beckham did well enough to distract you from an examination of the unsatisfactory reasons he gave for his drab form at Euro 2004. He puts it down to weight-training that, unbeknown to him, left him too heavy. Could he really have failed to realise that in an era of ceaseless monitoring? The England players stepped on to the scales daily in the weeks before they went to Portugal. In practice, there was no doubt that his frame had regained a lean and rangy quality at St James' Park and, with Nicky Butt sitting deep, he appreciated the freedom to roam available to the other three midfielders. It is up to Beckham to sustain his form, but his immediate revival on his international comeback after that galling penalty miss against Portugal was worthy of quiet respect. \"I am absolutely sure that he is extremely confident about his abilities as a football player,\" said Sven-Goran Eriksson. \"And he will never lose that as long as he can run. I am quite sure that he will have a great season. He wants to show that the criticisms haven't broken him.\" The match, pepped up by a dashing goal from the substitute Shaun Wright-Phillips on his international debut, was engrossing enough for the manager to sense that the country's focus \"had come back to football again\" after all the gaudy events in his private life and the FA's affairs. \"Hopefully this result will calm things down for a while,\" he ventured. Consoled by his salary, Eriksson has pressed on after being blamed for the failure at Euro 2004. \"I have been criticised many times,\" he said. \"People seldom have opinions before the match. But afterwards all of them have. You know that, if you go to a bar or out on to the street or if you read the papers. But that's beautiful. There is only one right answer - win football games.\" If England's qualifying group for the 2006 World Cup does not promise to be captivating, it might at least allow him to keep on succeeding. Next month Eriksson's team goes to Austria and Poland. Both of those teams were at home for friendlies on Wednesday and lost, respectively, 3-1 to Germany and 5-1 to Denmark. England should not be jaded by the club programme then and in October they face Wales at Old Trafford before travelling to Azerbaijan. It is quite feasible that Eriksson will shortly have 12 points on the board. Even if there is no upsurge of optimism about England becoming World Cup-winners, the manager will be close to ensuring that his team take part in Germany two years from now. Eriksson would enjoy peace to get on with contemplating his team. He seems to have accepted that the midfield will comprise four right-footed players, since Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Butt are the most valuable candidates. Acclaim for Butt, following his sale from Manchester United to Newcastle, seemed premature on Wednesday, when the play eluded him. Even so, Eriksson is convinced that only the conservative Butt can be depended on to protect the centre-backs from forwards who drop deep to try and run at them. A secure line-up, of course, can also safeguard a manager's job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
