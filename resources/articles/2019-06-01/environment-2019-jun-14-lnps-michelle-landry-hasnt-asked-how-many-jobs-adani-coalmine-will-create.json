In an interview marking the Queensland government\u2019s decision to sign off on Adani\u2019s groundwater management plan, Landry also compared the mine to an apartment block in Sydney, arguing that in neither case could regulators be certain of the environmental impact of the projects. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, has accused the Queensland government of adopting a \u201cdig it and see approach\u201d by allowing the mine to proceed with checks on its effect on ground springs to follow. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Landry told Radio National she believed the mine would proceed because Adani had done \u201ceverything they\u2019ve been asked to do\u201d. \u201cThis mine has the strictest environmental conditions of any mine in this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is continued ongoing work about the springs \u2013 because we certainly don\u2019t want it damaged \u2026 it will be constantly monitored.\u201d Landry claimed that \u201cnobody is certain with anything\u201d. \u201cWhen you build a housing block or estates down in Sydney \u2013 people don\u2019t know what that actually does to things, [likewise] when people build farms in areas.\u201d Landry said the Adani mine would create \u201c6,750 indirect jobs, 1,500 direct\u201d, of which 750 jobs would be fly-in fly-out from each of Rockhampton and Townsville. \u201cThere\u2019s a rail line being built, there\u2019s a lot of businesses right around central and northern Queensland that will be providing services,\u201d she said. Asked about the number of ongoing jobs, Landry said it would be \u201cwell over 2,000\u201d and rejected claims the mine would be fully automated, citing assurances from Adani Australia\u2019s chief executive, Lucas Dow. \u201cHe has assured us there will be as many local jobs as we can possibly have and, you know, you can\u2019t set a figure [on it] \u2026 I haven\u2019t got the figure \u2013 I could get the figure for you \u2013 I could ring Lucas [Dow] and get the figure. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the total number of jobs \u2026 [but it is] considerable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually asked a specific number.\u201d Landry suggested the number of ongoing jobs would be \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d, citing the fact that \u201ca lot of contractors are involved in this\u201d. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, has previously said the mine would create 1,500 jobs in the construction phase and 100 ongoing jobs, before claiming \u201cthere could be up to 1,800 ongoing jobs\u201d. In its latest statements Adani has said the number of ongoing operational jobs at the mine would not be 1,800 but between 800 and 1,500, based on mines of similar size in Queensland. Landry said opposition to the Carmichael mine was \u201ccrazy\u201d because other coalmines had been approved while Adani had sought approval for it. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of people saying we\u2019re doing the wrong thing up here.\u201d On Friday the Queensland government raised more questions about the federal government\u2019s decision to rush out its approval of Adani\u2019s groundwater management plan before calling the federal election, with the state\u2019s environment minister saying it \u201creeked of political interference\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
