He \"accumulated wealth by the basest arts\". After temporarily replacing Athanasius as archbishop of Alexandria, he acquired the \"monopoly of nitre, salt, paper, funerals etc\". His episcopal reign \"was polluted by cruelty and avarice\". A mob killed him on December 24 361 (60 years later than Percy states). Only later was this \"infamous George\" transformed into England's. I still recall when, aged eight (I had not yet read Gibbon, but my father had told me the gist), my answer in class did not get the expected approval. \"Children, can you tell me about St George?\" \"I know, Miss: he was a Lebanese black-marketeer.\" Charles Young Oxford"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
