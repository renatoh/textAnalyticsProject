Previously regarded as none of employers' business, obesity is increasingly becoming a concern for companies. \"Obesity is linked to a huge number of health problems and so the more obese staff you employ, the more likely you are to have people taking time off sick,\" explains Amanda Wynne, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association . \"In fact, new research has found back pain to be the largest cause of days off work, and obesity is one of the main contributors to back pain.\" If you're very overweight, you may also be less productive, she adds - something no employer welcomes. In the USA, some influential businesses and health advocates are even starting to calculate what the rising rates of obesity are costing the economy: the American Journal for Health Promotion estimates the total cost to US companies to be $13bn (\u00a37bn) per year. Wynne says the first steps towards reducing these problems involve employers looking at two areas: physical activity and food intake. \"When I was working in New Zealand, a lot of firms had shower facilities, which really encouraged people to walk, run or cycle to work,\" she says. \"I am hoping this is something we will begin to see more of in the UK. Another useful thing that some large companies do - and this already happens here - is to have a small gym built into the office environment. Meanwhile, companies of all sizes can, and often do, offer a subscription to a local fitness centre as a perk.\" Encouraging exercise during the working day is important too, she says - something the government has already taken on board. Its consultation document on how to increase citizens' physical activity devotes an entire chapter to \"Choosing activity in the workplace\". \"People in the UK spend approximately seven hours and 50 minutes a day in the workplace, so the impact of this environment on people's lives is significant,\" it states. \"The benefits to both physical and mental health from physical activity are, therefore, important considerations for both employees and employers.\" If employers take up the government's advice, you could soon start seeing signs to the stairs as a prompt to steer you away from the temptation of the lift. You may also find leaflets about nutrition left on your desk. One integrated health management programme, run by Vielife, provides all employees with access to personalised advice and information about diet, exercise, sleep and stress through an online service. Companies using such interventions report positive results. Standard Life Healthcare and Unilever, for example, found that after one year there was a 19% improvement in employees' nutrition scores, along with various other reported upturns in the health of workers. The issue of food intake involves companies giving consideration to anything from in-house cafeterias to vending machines to general food policies. Simon Tupper, director of Redcliffe Catering, which provides corporate canteen services, says most companies have already addressed the problem. \"Very few office canteens still have the meat-and-two-veg-type of dining,\" he says. \"You're much more likely to find options like jacket potatoes, deli bars, salads and sandwiches.\" But recruitment agency Pertemps is more cynical. Its most recent study on the subject found that burgers, fry-ups and stodgy puddings are the most popular lunchtime meal for one in three workers. \"Fatty foods are the meal of choice, with fewer staff choosing vegetarian dishes or low-calorie food in canteens,\" says a spokesperson. Other research shows that employees eat badly as a result of working through lunch-hours or working overlong hours. Kate Martin, managing partner of the contract caterers Brookwood Partnership, says employers must take action. \"I have been following the debate on obesity with great interest,\" she says. \"I found the survey commissioned by the Food Standards Agency very interesting and particularly agreed with its chairman John Krebbs when he said that families need support from schools, industry and broadcasters if the government is to make a difference on this issue. We all know that children need support in diet, but adults need support too. It takes imagination and it is harder work to produce a healthier menu, but it is worth it.\" The Institute on the Costs and Health Effects of Obesity, a US group founded two years ago by various Fortune 500 companies, says that having things like on-site Weight Watchers meetings and walking clubs can also be in employers' interests. Every dollar invested in weight-related programmes at an average company, it says, sees a $3 return. Most organisations involved in the fight against obesity agree that while a growing number of UK companies accept that they have a role to play in reducing obesity, the majority still do nothing about it. Kent Coykendall, vice-president at weight-loss club Jenny Craig, believes part of the problem is that weight is still a taboo subject. \"It's not openly discussed like smoking,\" he says. To address this communication problem, he says, companies should start by avoiding contradictory messages. \"It's no good having a weight-loss meeting in one room, with an all-you-can-eat buffet bar in the next,\" he says. But other employers are being driven to act by a sense of responsibility, a fear of growing absenteeism, lower productivity, and a concern about public reaction to an unhealthy workforce. The results - like the sudden absence of your favourite chocolate dessert - may be bitter, but they're for your own as well as the corporate good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
