The jurors will travel the week after the case begins on October 2, having heard scene-setting evidence and viewed maps and photos. When they return they will hear from witnesses via video link from France, including evidence about the princess's treatment in the Pont de l'Alma underpass and the journey to hospital. It will cover the embalming of her body, and suggestions she was pregnant. The jury will also hear \"the whole topic of Henri Paul\", Ian Burnett QC, counsel for the inquest, told the high court in London at the final preliminary hearing. Both the Metropolitan police's investigation, Operation Paget, and the French investigation concluded that the chauffeur had been drinking and driving too fast when his Mercedes crashed shortly after leaving the Ritz hotel, killing him, Diana and Dodi Fayed. Mr Burnett suggested that a dossier of data concerning a list of key players should be sought among the paperwork generated by Operation Paget, in response to a request from the legal team for Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed. Michael Mansfield QC, representing Mr Fayed, said the \"Squidgygate\" tapes, revealing a conversation between the princess and James Gilbey, should be produced, as an expert had cast doubt on whether they were made by an amateur radio enthusiast. He said this backed up Diana's suspicion that she was being monitored by the security services. The coroner, Lord Justice Baker, said: \"I'm not persuaded at the moment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
