Thanks so much for sticking with us through our opening-set hiccups. Here is the match report. During a on-court interview with ESPN, Djokovic says Cilic was clearly hampered by injury. He applauds his opponent for finishing the match rather that retiring. \u201cI haven\u2019t been very successful in the finals of the US Open,\u201d Djokovic says, noting he\u2019s won just one of his last four appearances. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been playing some of my best tennis on these courts so I look forward to it. I definitely can promise I will give the maximum of my abilities. Of course I can\u2019t predict the result, but I\u2019ll give it my best.\u201d Third set: Djokovic 6-2 Cilic A quick winner by Djokovic followed by an error by Cilic and he\u2019s two points from the final. Shrewd approach by Djokovic to shorten the point and he uncorks a leap reverse volley winner at the net for triple match point. Cilic saves the first when Djokovic nets a backhand, but then Cilic sends a forehand long and Djokovic is through to the US Open final in a scant 85 minutes. Third set: *Djokovic 5-2 Cilic (*denotes next server) Cilic quickly falls behind love-30, then mixes in another unforced error \u2013 his 34th to Djokovic\u2019s 12 \u2013 to go triple break point down. Now he nets a backhand from behind the baseline to be broken at love. Incredibly, the big serve has been broken in eight of his 10 service games today. Third set: Djokovic 4-2 Cilic* (*denotes next server) At 15-15, Djokovic fires two more winners \u2013 his 13th and 14th \u2013 to move ahead 40-15. Then another error by Cilic and Djokovic is within two games of the final. Third set: *Djokovic 3-2 Cilic (*denotes next server) And Cilic can\u2019t consolidate. More sloppy play from the Croat puts him in a 15-40 hole, followed by an overcooked forehand wide that sees him broken for the seventh time today. Third set: Djokovic 2-2 Cilic* (*denotes next server) And how about this! Cilic shows a pulse, pounding a couple of winners into the corners to steal a game from Djokovic and bring it back to on serve in the third. But while the Croat rallied from two sets down in Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, it would seem this would be a steeper mountain to scale. Third set: *Djokovic 2-1 Cilic (*denotes next server) Cilic manages to hold for only the second time today, but in doing so avoids absorbing the most lopsided beating ever in a US Open semi-final. Third set: *Djokovic 2-0 Cilic (*denotes next server) Another perfunctory hold for Djokovic, who is completely locked in on his serve. Third set: *Djokovic 1-0 Cilic (*denotes next server) And it\u2019s managed to get worse for Cilic, who\u2019s broken again early in the third. Can\u2019t remember a defending US Open champion going down this definitively. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 Cilic Cilic manages to rattle off a couple of points and puts Djokovic in a 15-30 hole, but Djokovic responds with a blisterning forehand winner that paints the line and a 122mph ace to give him a set point. The world No1 wastes no time, crunching another forehand winner early in the point to lock down a two-sets-to-none lead. Clinical. Second set: *Djokovic 5-1 Cilic (*denotes next server) Cilic broken again and this has gone from grim to something different entirely. What a way for the Croat\u2019s 12-match US Open streak to \u2013 it would certainly seem \u2013 come to an end. Second set: Djokovic 4-1 Cilic* (*denotes next server) Another comfortable hold for Djokovic. This is one-way traffic. Just dominant on his serve. Second set: *Djokovic 3-1 Cilic (*denotes next server) At 15-15, another unforced error by Cilic \u2013 his 18th to Djokovic\u2019s four \u2013 puts him in a 15-30. Cilic levels it at 30-all but Cilic overcooks a forehand from the baseline to put him break point down yet again. And another forehand long from the baseline sees Cilic broken for the fourth time in five service games. Second set: Djokovic 2-1 Cilic* (*denotes next server) Three quick ponts by Djokovic, who is completely locked in on his serve. Yet another unforced error by Cilic gives another easy hold to the world No1. Second set: *Djokovic 1-1 Cilic (*denotes next server) Cilic with a service winner to open, but Djokovic levels it at 15-all with backhand winner from the middle of the court. Another winner for Cilic, but then he sprays a forehand from the baseline long and it\u2019s 30-all. That\u2019s Cilic\u2019s 11th unforced error of the match to just three for Djokovic. An untimely double fault for Cilic and now he\u2019s break point down, but he saves it quickly with a thudding ace. Another backhand soars wide of the line and Djokovic has a second break point. A lunging volley by Cilic to end a short point saves it, then another ace gives him a game point. Another unforced error on the forehand side brings it back to deuce. Winner by Cilic and an error by Djokovic \u2013 a chair umpire overrule confirmed by a challenge \u2013 puts Cilic on the board for the first time today. Second set: Djokovic 1-0 Cilic* (*denotes next server) This is perfect tennis from Djokovic. His blue shirt is perfectly camouflaged against that of the court \u2013 he looks a blur as he effortlessly slides across the baseline \u2013 and he sprints to a 30-0 lead before a backhand down the line finds the line. Cilic is nowhere, he already looks defeated. Another serve out wide and a Cilic error closes out the game. 1-0 in the second set. Novak Djokovic* 6-0 Marin Cilic (*denotes next server) Cilic is all at sea, and he falls to 30-0 down. The Croatian shakes his head. Deep breaths. A couple of handy serves comes to his aid, before an absurd drop shot \u2013 out of keeping with his touch in his first serve \u2013 saves set point at 40-30 down. Cilic gets to deuce but eventually succumbs: a Djokovic forehand forcing an error. Djokovic has the first set. Inside 24 minutes. Wow. Some technical issues here \u2013 apologies for the delay \u2013 but Novak Djokovic has wasted no time at all and raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening exchanges. It\u2019s Cilic to serve, can he salvage anything from this first set?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
