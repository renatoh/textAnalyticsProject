The Newcastle United defender attempted to cushion a header back to Jasper Cillessen inside the area but it beat the Dutch keeper, struck the post and fell for Pilar to tuck the rebound into the net. The Czechs had started brightly and were rewarded in the 22nd minute when David Lafata controlled a cross in the box before laying it off to Borek Dockal, whose left-footed shot flew into the net off a post. The Dutch, third-place finishers at the World Cup in Brazil, equalised through a Stefan de Vrij header from a Daley Blind cross but the Czechs snatched victory through Pilar. The match was Guus Hiddink\u2019s first competitive game in charge since his return to the national side after Louis van Gaal stepped down to take charge of Manchester United. \u201cThe Czechs played well,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cWe have to learn our lesson but it is too soon to analyse what happened. It [the winner] was an unlucky goal but the system doesn\u2019t matter if you make individual mistakes.\u201d Simone Zaza and Leonardo Bonucci gave Antonio Conte a 2-0 victory over Norway in his first competitive game as Italy coach. The visitors took the lead in the 16th minute when Zaza\u2019s tame shot deflected off Haavard Nortveidt and wrong-footed Orjan Nyland. Norway enjoyed plenty of possession but failed to create any clearcut chances and Italy\u2019s captain Bonucci made it 2-0 after 62 minutes, rising unmarked to power home a downward header from Manuel Pasqual\u2019s cross. Dimitris Christofi scored twice against the run of play to give unfancied Cyprus a smash-and-grab 2-1 win in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Edin Dzeko\u2019s first game as captain. Bosnia seemed to be cruising after a Vedad Ibisevic header gave them an early lead but they spurned several chances before Christofi beat Asmir Begovic with a header. Bosnia laid siege to the Cyprus defence after the break but were again caught out at the other end when Christofi raced clear to beat the advancing Begovic with a cool finish. Miralem Pjanic saw a weak penalty kick saved by Antonis Georgallides in the 89th minute to complete a miserable night for the hosts. Croatia recorded a 2-0 home win over 10-man Malta with goals from Luka Modric and the emerging 23-year-old striker Andrej Kramaric. Modric celebrated his 29th birthday by breaking the deadlock with a sizzling low shot in the 46th minute before the second-half substitute Kramaric capped a fine individual performance with a late goal on his competitive debut. Gylfi Sigurdsson was on target as Iceland beat 10-man Turkey 3-0 to go top of Group A ahead of Italy on goal difference. Jon Dadi Bodvarsson scored in the 18th minute and Iceland\u2019s task of defending their lead was made easier when Omer Toprak was sent off in the 59th minute for his second yellow card. Sigurdsson doubled the lead in the 76th minute and Kolbeinn Sigthorsson completed the scoring a minute later. Ventsislav Hristov came off the substitutes bench to score a late header which earned Bulgaria a 2-1 victory in Azerbaijan. Kazakhstan and Latvia played out a 0-0 draw in Almaty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
