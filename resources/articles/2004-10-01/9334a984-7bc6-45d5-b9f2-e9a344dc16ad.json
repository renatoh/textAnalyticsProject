The US army has wholly inadequate ground forces for the task they have been asked to undertake. But they have approximately 140,000 soldiers in theatre. How much difference can a battalion battle group of 650 men make? The purpose of this request is obvious. First, to provide a figleaf for this wholly illegal war to assist the re-election of the US president. Second, to embroil British forces deeper into the war. It is clear that the UK is yet again being used by the Bush administration as a pawn in its game. How long will parliament permit this manipulation of this country to persist? Perhaps Ukip would care to focus on this as an example of loss of British sovereignty. DJ Browning Altrincham, Cheshire I am startled by much of the reaction to the proposed redeployment of some UK troops. Are they involved in a separate war from the other members of the alliance, or are they there to assist the Iraqis in ejecting insurgent forces so that they can proceed peacefully towards establishing a democratic government? If it is the latter, there is no question that they should be deployed wherever they are most needed. The support and encouragement our soldiers need to help them to complete the task is pitifully lacking here at home. Colin Bower Chelmsford, Essex If the Commons does not shortly vote on this new Iraq crisis provoked by the ill-judged US military request, it will give the clearest signal to the already none-too- impressed British electorate that it really is irrelevant. It should vote without delay on a motion to defer an answer to the US until after the presidential election. Peter Draper London As a US citizen who has lived in Britain, I write to plead with both the British government and people not to give in to the cynical tactic being employed by our president. I am sure you are aware of our much higher casualty rate. One of Kerry's criticisms of Bush's Iraq policy is that he ignores the rest of the world's advice and, possibly because he snubbed some potential allies last year, 90% of the death rate is sustained by the US. Isn't it obvious that Bush's request to send British troops into harm's way now is a blatant attempt to negate Kerry's charge. Your soldiers have done enough to prove the UK is a staunch ally. Eileen Fay Kingston, New York, USA Why should it be down to America alone to make the \"long-expected full-scale ground assault on Falluja\", which is, according to you, \"believed to be the stronghold of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Tawhid wal Jihad group, which killed British hostage Kenneth Bigley\"? Must the Americans do our dirty work for us? Alastair Albright London You state that: \"More gruesome has been the talk in some US circles of the need for British troops to \"share more of the load\" (Leaders, October 18). There have been 68 British troops killed compared to 1,062 American. With 138,000 US troops in theatre, they have lost one in 130. With our 8,500, we have lost one in 125. Ian Miller Cambridge A loan of 650 British troops is negligible. But this could be the thin end of the wedge. Having agreed to 650, it will be harder to refuse the next request for more.
