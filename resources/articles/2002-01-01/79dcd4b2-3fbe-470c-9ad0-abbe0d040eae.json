Rome was Caravaggio's making and his downfall, the city of wealth and power where he arrived as a promising young painter of still lifes in 1592. Rome had art patrons such as Cardinal Francesco del Monte, in whose palace he lived for a while; it had churches in need of paintings to make the biblical narratives immediate to the laity in an age of Counter-Reformation; it also had a vicious, scabrous street life of brothels and vendettas - all of which Caravaggio, the greatest Italian baroque painter, fed on. His art begins as a patient attempt to make fruits and flowers look real. But as Caravaggio pursued an art of naturalism in Rome in the 1590s, his flowers became props in what appears to be a homoerotic game in which the cardinals were complicit. In 1606, Caravaggio's Roman period ended when he fled the city after killing a man. Subject: As in all of Caravaggio's paintings, we have the sense of a real living model, a Roman street boy who has agreed to pose. It is both a fiction and a real depiction of a late 16th-century youth, whose relationship to the painter is part of the mystery. Distinguishing features: The boy starts back in alarm as a lizard concealed among succulent cherries sinks its teeth deep into his finger. His red, full lips pout in pain. He has a flower in his hair and wears loose, easily removed robes. In his distress, his shoulder is exposed and catches the light. We have no doubt the boy is real, the painting participating in as well as recording a moment of intense drama. Caravaggio has told him to pose like that, dressed him like that. And he knew that the cardinals - who bought his paintings and knew their Ovid and the Renaissance trick of substituting classical, pastoral scenes of sensuality and its punishment for Christian ones - would enjoy both the painting's pristine perfection and its teasing of the viewer. This painting is confrontational. Do we really feel able to just interpret and neutralise it as a religious allegory, as many art historians argue contemporaries would have done - a jokey illustration of vice's painful comeuppance? Caravaggio's insistence that this is a real boy, and that some of his shock is real, makes it hard to see the painting that safely. It is electric with sexuality. And because it lives so dangerously, it is an enduring trace of the anonymous Roman youth, one of the people outside art history to whom Caravaggio gave a moment in the spotlight. Inspirations and influences: Few painters have so influenced the course of art. The naturalist turn in 17th-century painting begins with him, and was emulated by everyone. Velazquez started out painting Caravaggesque street scenes in Seville; the Dutch imitators of Caravaggio took his style north, where it inspired Vermeer. Where is it?
