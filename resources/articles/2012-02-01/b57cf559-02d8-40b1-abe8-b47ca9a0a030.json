Releasing twin albums a year apart might seem like excessive prevarication, but in the context of Earth's lugubrious pace, that's practically a simultaneous release. As with so much of Carlson's work, these five songs suggest a mournful last dance in the decrepit roadhouse of some faded midwest mining town. But its the little flourishes that make them truly majestic: the droning psyche-folk thrum of His Teeth Did Brightly Shine; the country twang and graceful melodies of A Multiplicity of Doors; and the warm, reverb-heavy funk (and, yes, that's a word you don't hear often attached to this four-piece) of the album's closer, The Rakehell, which brings to mind Lalo Schifrin's Dirty Harry soundtracks. This is easily the equal of, if not superior to, its illustrious companion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
