The traditional remedy used to be to give the dormant trees a \"winter wash\", which meant spraying them with a tar oil solution. But this was far from ideal, because it ended up killing many goodies as well as the baddies, and also left the garden smelling of disinfectant. Now, following the recent EU review of garden pesticides, this product has been taken off the market altogether, leaving nothing equivalent in its place. Even so, one simple - and much more pleasant - measure you can take is to encourage garden birds, particularly the blue tits, to do the dirty work for you. As they hop and peck their way around the trees, they will be seeking out aphid eggs and codling moth cocoons from under the bark and in the crevices. So put out sunflower seeds and hang up fat balls and peanuts in the trees - while the blue tits are waiting for the larger birds to vacate these feeders, they will be scouring the branches. These small birds are also vulnerable to the cold, so keep some dense thickets in the garden - ivy or clematis on a wall, for example, or even the odd leylandii - to provide valuable shelter on freezing nights. And plan to put up some birdboxes ready for spring - a box with a tiny hole (25mm in diameter) in a private, shady place makes the ideal home for a blue tit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
