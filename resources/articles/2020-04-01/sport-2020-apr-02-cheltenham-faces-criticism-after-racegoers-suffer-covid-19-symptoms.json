The Festival opened on 10 March with at least 60,000 racegoers in attendance each afternoon, while 68,500 were at the track to see the Cheltenham Gold Cup on 13 March \u2013 four days before Boris Johnson announced extensive UK-wide lockdown measures. As well as Parker Bowles, the comedian Lee Mack and footballer Charlie Austin are among racegoers to have subsequently reported symptoms of Covid-19 infection, along with two local men who were working at bars or restaurants at the course during the meeting. The Guardian has also been contacted by a relative of a 65-year-old man who is currently receiving treatment in intensive care following a positive test for Covid-19. He believes he was infected during a business meeting with a contact who had been to the festival and also subsequently tested positive for the virus. \u201cI would say that Cheltenham should have erred on the side of caution,\u201d his relative said. \u201cI think they should have made their own decision and not be passing the buck. \u201cI understand that they were acting in accordance with government advice at the time. However, the government was subsequently criticised as well for not acting quickly enough on this. I think we\u2019re seeing the effects in this lockdown of not acting quickly enough and what could be possible by taking stricter measures such as we are at the moment. That\u2019s potentially going to have an effect on the number of new cases already.\u201d The Festival\u2019s organisers said the meeting, and several other high-profile sporting events the same week, went ahead following extensive consultation. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Festival concluded three weeks ago and went ahead under the clear and ongoing guidance from the government and its science experts throughout, like other popular sports events at Twickenham [and] Murrayfield, 10 Premier League matches and the Uefa Champions League [between Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid] at Anfield that same week. \u201cWe promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event, including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins.\u201d Sue Smith, the senior racecourse medical officer at Cheltenham, said on Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s simply not possible to know how and where someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 has contracted it\u201d. Smith added: \u201cThe standards of hand wash and hygiene at the Festival were of the highest level and all measures were taken in accordance with daily updates from Public Health England.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Thursday that Cheltenham\u2019s decision accorded with the measures in place on 10 March. \u201cIt is our absolute priority to protect people\u2019s health, and our advice on coronavirus is the result of direct, continuous consultation with medical experts,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cCheltenham Festival was operating within clear Public Health England guidance at the time.\u201d The decision to hold Liverpool\u2019s game with Atl\u00e9tico at Anfield has been heavily criticised, particularly because Madrid was by then known to be a centre for the virus in Spain. And Cheltenham\u2019s decision to go ahead \u2013 and the decision of 20,000 Irish people to travel over for the festival \u2013 triggered widespread anger and disbelief in Ireland last month. \u201cIf Cheltenham was being held in Ireland I don\u2019t think it would be on, quite frankly,\u201d Simon Coveney, the foreign minister and t\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister), told RT\u00c9\u2019s flagship news show, Prime Time. Media commentators and social media users went further and condemned as irresponsible those who at the start of the coronavirus outbreak trooped on to planes, ferries and trains and packed stands and pubs in the Cotswolds before returning home to potentially spread coronavirus. \u201cDamned if this timeless paradise of horse-iness is going to be thrown off course by some poxy little global pandemic,\u201d said the Irish Times. However, to date there has been just one case linked to the Festival \u2013 a man diagnosed with Covid-19 two weeks after he returned to Ireland. He has not been named and it is unclear where he became infected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
