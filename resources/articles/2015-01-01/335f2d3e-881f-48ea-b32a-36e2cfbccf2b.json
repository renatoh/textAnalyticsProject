Surely they are refugees and/or asylum seekers. Defining them otherwise turns them into cannon fodder for our own economic, political and racial xenophobes. Ivan Rendall Kings Green, Worcestershire \u2022 Ian Bostridge\u2019s reflections on \u201ccrossovers\u201d between classical and popular performance (Cold comfort, Review, 2 January) remind me of the surprising example in Richard Whorf\u2019s film It Happened in Brooklyn: Sinatra singing an English version of Don Giovanni\u2019s L\u00e0 Ci Darem la Mano. Quirky, but not at all unpleasant. Martin Brady London \u2022 Bill Gabbett (Letters, 3 December) refers to English public school boys who (some people think) \u201cwon the Battle of Britain\u201d. Just for the record, of the 3,000 fighter pilots recorded as having flown sorties in that encounter, 600 (20%) were known to have attended a public school. John Prance Preston \u2022 Young independent filmmakers Shut Out The Light have produced a powerful short film Still Ragged: 100 Years of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (Letters, 1 January), which they have been touring and is available via their website. Dr Nicola Wilson University of Reading \u2022 Mary Gildea calls for an experiment where the country is run by non-male people (Letters, 5 January). We ran that experiment \u2013 we called it Thatcherism \u2013 and we\u2019re still paying for it now. PA Chalmers Southwick, West Sussex \u2022 A few years ago I passed a sign outside a church in Bradford: \u201cPrayer \u2013 the original Wi-Fi\u201d (Lloyd Webber calls for Wi-Fi for all churches, 5 January).
