Stick around for all the match report and reaction, but from me, cheerio! A quick word from Gulbadin Naib: \u201cWe missed something in the fielding. But credit to Shakib, he bowled really well.\u201d And here\u2019s Mashrafe Mortaza: \u201cShakib has been fantastic, phenomenal.\u201d Fair to say that result has added to the pressure on England. Bangladesh sit just a point behind the hosts now, though Eoin Morgan\u2019s side have a game in hand. Bangladesh have India and Pakistan still to play; England face Australia, New Zealand and India \u2013 the three teams above them in the table. Here\u2019s Shakib, the man of the match: \u201cIt was a terrific team effort,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo more important matches coming up against India and Pakistan \u2013 we\u2019ll have to play to the best of our abilities.\u201d Not much of a contest in truth, with Bangladesh only briefly under any kind of pressure. Bangladesh have a long wait until they face India but they\u2019ll go into that game a) fancying their chances and b) hoping two wins can take them into the semis. NOOOOO! Shinwari is left stranded on 49 as his young colleague backs away to leg and swings wildly. And, it turns out, inaccurately. 47th over: Afghanistan 200-9 (Shinwari 49, Mujeeb 0) Shinwari still has his half-century and a 200 for Afghanistan to fight for. A hammering drive straight back past Shaifuddin brings both closer. Then a top edge drops \u2026 safe to bring up the 200. He moves to 49 and faces a nervous wait as Mujeeb takes strike for the final two balls. First ball blocked. Second ball \u2026 46th over: Afghanistan 195-9 (Shinwari 43, Mujeeb 0) The 18-year-old Mujeeb Ur Rahman is last man for Afghanistan. The last ball of the over bounces a whisker over the bails as the No 11 backs away to leg. Just one run from the over. Mustafizur continues as Bangladesh look to wrap this up. And we move a step closer \u2013 the faintest of faint edges through to the keeper from the Afghanistan No 10. 45th over: Afghanistan 194-8 (Shinwari 43, Dawlat 0) Shinwari scuttles for two off Shakib\u2019s first ball of his final over. And there\u2019s a single a ball or two later. Dawlat opts just to see it out. And there\u2019s a huge ovation at the end of the over \u2013 that\u2019s the end of Shakib\u2019s work today: 10-1-29-5. 44th over: Afghanistan 191-8 (Shinwari 40, Dawlat 0) Play-and-miss first up from Dawlat and Afghanistan are going to fall well short once again. Rashid Khan can\u2019t get hold of Mustafizur short ball and instead plonks it straight into the hands of the Bangladesh captain at midwicket. 43rd over: Afghanistan 189-7 (Shinwari 36, Rashid 1) Rashid Khan looked as organised as any Afghanistan batsman when I saw them at Cardiff against South Africa the other weekend. But, as was the case back then, the top order has left too much to do. Got him! Najibullah goes for a big hit against Shakib, can connect with only fresh Hampshire air and Mushfiqur does the required behind the stumps. Five-fer for Shakib, to go with his fifty earlier on. Not a bad day\u2019s work. 42nd over: Afghanistan 184-6 (Shinwari 36, Najibullah 22) There may just be a few heart-rates creeping up among the Bangladeshi players and supporters. They could do with a wicket just to snuff out this little uprising. This pair bring up a 50 partnership from 41 balls thanks to some well-placed shots and some hard running. Seven from the Shaifuddin over. 41st over: Afghanistan 177-6 (Shinwari 34, Najibullah 17) Shakib (7-1-10-4) returns. And those figures lose their edge. Najibullah scampers two from the first, then chips down the ground for a single. And from the last Shinwari smashes a six over long off. 40th over: Afghanistan 166-6 (Shinwari 27, Najibullah 13) Two singles from the first two balls of Shaifuddin\u2019s latest over, the second coming off a daft overthrow. And, a few balls later, he sends down a hideous leg-side wide. This pair are giving Afghanistan a glimmer \u2013 a teeny, tiny glimmer \u2013 of hope. 39th over: Afghanistan 160-6 (Shinwari 24, Najibullah 11) Shinwari cuts through backward point for four! Fine shot but Mustafizur has him playing and missing outside off a couple of balls later. Six off the over. The Required Rate sidles past Nine and begins to wander in the vague direction of Ten. 38th over: Afghanistan 154-6 (Shinwari 19, Najibullah 10) Najibullah, looking to be assertive, drives Mosaddek sweetly through the covers for four to bring up the Afghanistan 150 then scampers a single. 109 required from 72 balls. 37th over: Afghanistan 147-6 (Shinwari 17, Najibullah 5) Mustafizuq struggles a bit for line here, spraying either side of the wicket. The batsmen work him around for six. 36th over: Afghanistan 141-6 (Shinwari 13, Najibullah 4) Actually I\u2019m being a bit harsh on Shinwari there \u2013 Ikram had only himself to blame really. Najibullah thumps his first ball over the top for four, and Shinwari sweeps for four too. It\u2019s a bit too little too late surely. Two appeals the first ball after the drinks break. Mehidy yelps for an lbw decision \u2013 not given \u2013 but it matters not because Ikram is run out by a direct hit at the non-striker\u2019s end. Shinwari hasn\u2019t run himself out but he\u2019s helped scupper his young batting partner there. 35th over: Afghanistan 132-5 (Shinwari 8, Ikram 11) Mustafizur returns. Nudge, nurdle and, from the last, nick! But there\u2019s no one at slip so Ikram picks up a welcome boundary. And that\u2019s drinks. 34th over: Afghanistan 125-5 (Shinwari 7, Ikram 6) Mortaza once more. Ikram nudges to deep backward square leg for two and he\u2019s unlucky to spank a cut straight at the man at point. He\u2019s looked more comfortable out there than any of his teammates thus far. And he nabs the strike off the last too. 33rd over: Afghanistan 119-5 (Shinwari 6, Ikram 1) Ikram Ali Khil is next up. Shakib\u2019s figures just keep getting better: 7-1-10-4 now. Shakib has another! Afghan finally looks to break the shackles but can only pick out the man on the midwicket boundary. 32nd over: Afghanistan 117-4 (Shinwari 5, Afghan 20) Mortaza brings himself back into the attack. Afghan misses out on a wide half-volley. The Required Run Rate wanders past Eight and purposefully strides in the direction of Nine. 31st over: Afghanistan 113-4 (Shinwari 4, Afghan 17) Shinwari seems determined to run himself out, charging down the pitch pretty much every time he hits the ball before angry words from his partner send him back. Just a couple of singles from Shakib\u2019s latest. 30th over: Afghanistan 111-4 (Shinwari 3, Afghan 16) That over has woken the crowd up \u2013 they were just beginning to snooze but the party atmosphere has returned. Four off Shaifuddin\u2019s latest with a wild waft from Shinwari to finish things off. 29th over: Afghanistan 106-4 (Shinwari 2, Afghan 13) Shakib now has spectacular figures of 5-1-6-3. What a player. It\u2019s a bit early to say that\u2019s that but it\u2019s a really tall order for Afghanistan now. Mohammad Nabi, the main reason they got as close as they did against India, is the new man. And he\u2019s gone, second ball! Shakib sneaks one between bat and pad and that really could be that. Gulbadin goes at last! He cover-drives Shakib\u2019s first of a fresh over \u2013 not uppishly but there\u2019s a man in at short cover to pouch a low catch. 28th over: Afghanistan 104-2 (Gulbadin 47, Afghan 13) Gulbadin heaves for one and looks frustrated to find himself stuck at the non-striker\u2019s end as Shaifuddin continues to rumble in. Afghan this time manages to find a single, though. Gulbadin celebrates with another awkward heave for a single. There\u2019s no lack of intent but he\u2019s still struggling to time the ball out there. 27th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A silly point comes in \u2013 I think it\u2019s Liton Das under the lid. Afghan responds by blocking, blocking and blocking again. A fine over from Shakib \u2013 just one from it. The Required Run Rate waves merrily at Seven as it passes by and strides confidently off towards Eight. 26th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A bit of pace for a change \u2013 Shaifuddin returns to the attack. A punch down the ground (one that the bowler deflects worryingly close to umpire Gough\u2019s armpit) brings up the Afghanistan 100. Three from the over. 25th over: Afghanistan 98-2 (Gulbadin 44, Afghan 10) Shakib (2-0-2-1) returns. Two from the over, the second coming off another bit of hesitant running, Afghan imploring his captain to stop, stop, STOPPPPP! as he comes roaring down the wicket. And then scrambling through for one. 24th over: Afghanistan 96-2 (Gulbadin 43, Afghan 9) Mehidy continues into his seventh over. Asghar Afghan sweeps hard for four \u2013 lovely shot. I think I\u2019m right in saying that\u2019s the first boundary Mehidy has conceded in this innings. 23rd over: Afghanistan 87-2 (Gulbadin 41, Afghan 1) Gulbadin tries his best to get things moving, lofting Mosaddek over the covers for four, but the required rate has crept past Six and is striding confidently towards Seven, with a song in its heart and a whistle on its lips. 22nd over: Afghanistan 81-2 (Gulbadin 36, Afghan 1) \u201cAs much as we\u2019d like an Afghan win, this will go the way of the India game,\u201d reckons Kevin Wilson. \u201cThey just can\u2019t scratch around not losing wickets. Getting a run a ball or more over 30 overs just isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Yes, that does feel the way it\u2019s going. The weak link before the tournament seemed to be their batting and that\u2019s how it\u2019s played out. They just don\u2019t have a batsman who strikes any fear into the opposition. The whole lineup feels containable. Mehidy rattles through another one \u2013 6-0-19-0. 21st over: Afghanistan 79-2 (Gulbadin 35, Afghan 0) A fine bit of bowling from Mosaddek that. Advantage Bangladesh you sense. Mosaddek continues. And finally somethings happens \u2013 a push into the off, a misfield, and a farcical bit of running that at one point sees both batsmen stood stock still in the middle of the pitch, watching as the fielder prepares to pick up the ball and shy at the stumps. Hashmatullah just manages to scramble back \u2026 and there\u2019s no run. But two balls later he\u2019s gone! A lovely bit of bowling sees Mosaddek sneak the ball past Hashmat\u2019s heave to leg and, with his back foot sliding out of the crease, Mushfiqur does the necessary. 20th over: Afghanistan 77-1 (Gulbadin 34, Hashmatullah 10) Mehidy continues into his fifth over. Single, single, single, single, dot, dot. Even the thus-far boisterous Hampshire Bowl crowd has been lulled into a bit of a stupor. 19th over: Afghanistan 73-1 (Gulbadin 32, Hashmatullah 8) Mosaddek concedes just one from his latest. We\u2019ve not had a sniff of a wicket since Rahmat went and we\u2019ve had only one boundary since the ninth over. It\u2019s a war of attrition at the moment. 18th over: Afghanistan 72-1 (Gulbadin 31, Hashmatullah 8) Hashmatullah unfurls the sweep once more, finally discomfiting the otherwise unpeturbed Mehidy. The batsmen have looked a little more sure of themselves, a little more assertive, since the drinks break. 17th over: Afghanistan 65-1 (Gulbadin 27, Hashmatullah 5) Gulbadin needs some attention from the old magic sponge during the drinks break. He seems OK though. Mosaddek finds Hashmatullah\u2019s outside edge on the resumption but there\u2019s no slip so the batsman picks up a couple. 16th over: Afghanistan 60-1 (Gulbadin 25, Hashmatullah 2) Mehidy is enjoying bowling on this pitch. Hashmatullah, Afghanistan\u2019s leading runscorer in the tournament so far, sees out three dots then sweeps hard for a single. He goes to two from 14 balls. Mehidy\u2019s figures read 3-0-6-0 after that one. 15th over: Afghanistan 58-1 (Gulbadin 24, Hashmatullah 1) Mosaddek, fresh from a cracking little cameo at the end of the Bangladesh innings, comes into the attack, with Mortaza perhaps sensing he can sneak through a few overs cheaply while these batsmen are becalmed. And becalmed they are \u2013 Gulbadin, who should really have his eye in now, sees off five scratchy dots. At least from the last he launches over the top of mid off for a pressure-relieving four. 14th over: Afghanistan 54-1 (Gulbadin 20, Hashmatullah 1) Hashmatullah finally gets off the mark with a dangerous single to mid on \u2013 Gulbadin was none-too-sure about that one but his partner screamed him through regardless. A jaffer from Mehidy to end the over \u2013 ripping and turning joyfully past the outside edge of Hashmat\u2019s bat. 13th over: Afghanistan 51-1 (Gulbadin 18, Hashmatullah 0) And it\u2019s more of the same from Shakib. Hashmatullah in particular is looking a little uncertain \u2013 he\u2019s faced eight balls and is yet to get the ball off the square never mind get himself off the mark. 12th over: Afghanistan 50-1 (Gulbadin 17, Hashmatullah 0) Mehidy form the other end as Bangladesh opt for a double dose of spin. A nudge for one brings up the 50 but it\u2019s a tight and testing over from Mehidy. 11th over: Afghanistan 49-1 (Gulbadin 16, Hashmatullah 0) Ugh, that was rather ugly from Rahmat, and so unnecessary. Spin for the first time courtesy of the world No 1 all-rounder and leading run-scorer in the tournament Shakib Al Hasan. And it produces the breakthrough \u2013 a few dots crank up the pressure then Rahmat tries to smear the ball into the stands, mistimes, and Tamim takes a simple catch. 10th over: Afghanistan 48-0 (Gulbadin 15, Rahmat 24) Shaifuddin once more and once more he\u2019s nice and accurate. Just three off the over. This - Captain Obvious alert \u2013 has been a really solid start from Afghanistan. 9th over: Afghanistan 45-0 (Gulbadin 12, Rahmat 24) Mortaza\u2019s turn to drop short and Rahmat pulls hard for four down to backward square leg but the bowler strikes back with one that just holds its line outside off, flashing past outside edge and stumps. Gulbadin clubs over the top of mid on \u2013 mistiming it a touch \u2013 for three, then Rahmat carves sweetly through point for four more! That\u2019s a very profitable over for Afghanistan \u2013 12 from it. 8th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Gulbadin 9, Rahmat 15) Shaifuddin enters the attack, with Afghanistan perhaps just a little bit too comfortable for Mortaza\u2019s comfort. A single each for the batsmen. 7th over: Afghanistan 31-0 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 14) Rahmat shovels Mortaza into the leg side for a couple, then \u2013 hello! \u2013 skips down the wicket and attempts to find the stands at cow corner. He succeeds only in chipping the ball about two-thirds of the way to the rope, which says a bit about the awkward nature of this pitch. 6th over: Afghanistan 27-0 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 10) The Fiz beats Gulbadin all ends up with a little leg cutter that zips past the outside edge. The Afghanistan captain gratefully scampers a single from the next. Gulbadin gets his revenge later in the over though, clubbing Mustafizur back down the ground for four. 5th over: Afghanistan 21-0 (Gulbadin 3, Rahmat 9) Mortaza keeps things tight. And that\u2019s about all there is to say about that. 4th over: Afghanistan 20-0 (Gulbadin 2, Rahmat 9) Mustafizur drops short for the first time and the ball just sits up screaming \u201cHit me! Hit me!\u201d at the top of its little lungs. Rahmat obliges pulling majestically down to cow corner for four. Five from the over all told. 3rd over: Afghanistan 15-0 (Gulbadin 2, Rahmat 5) Mortaza wangs down another leg-side wide and his radar seems a little off. Six off the over in ones and twos. 2nd over: Afghanistan 8-0 (Gulbadin 0, Rahmat 2) Mustafizur at the other end. He loses his line, drifting onto Gulbadin\u2019s pads and four leg byes are the result. They\u2019re the only runs from the over, though. If Gulbadin brought himself up the order to pinch hit \u2026 well, he\u2019s not off the mark yet having faced eight balls. 1st over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Gulbadin 0, Rahmat 2) Mashrafe Mortaza starts things off for Bangladesh and a little leg bye gets Afghanistan off the mark. Rahmat clips to leg for the first runs off the bat, there\u2019s a wide and it\u2019s four off the over all told. You feel Afghanistan have got to get their collective foot on the accelerator early doors here but there was no sign there of any out-of-the-ordinary aggression. Out stride the openers: Gulbadin Naib, the captain promoting himself up the order, and Rahmat Shah. Hello everyone. I can only echo Dan\u2019s sentiments \u2013 this looks to be a few too many for Afghanistan on a tricky pitch. Their scores so far at this tournament have been short of their target today \u2013 207, 152, 172, 125, 247-8 and 213. Anyhow, thanks all for your company and comments - John Ashdown will be here presently to coax you through the chase. In the meantime, here\u2019s something to read. Afghanistan bowled pretty well but let themselves down with their fielding, and probably lack the firepower to chase a decent total on a difficult pitch and slow outfield. If they\u2019re going to get it, they probably need to go early, because once the fielders are back and the rate\u2019s up, they\u2019re in trouble. Which looks like 30 too many to me, but what do I know. A slower ball yorker, from the back of the hand, foxes Mosaddek, who\u2019s too slow on it, but what an innings that is - it might just have decided the game, pushing a competitive total just out of reach. 50th over: Bangladesh 262-6 (Mosaddek 35, Shaifuddin 2) Gulbadin brings himself back to finish off and Mossadek trusts his partner, excavating a yorker for a single. And, well, dearie me, Saifuddin edges a slower one, two men converge on a dolly, and Dawlat spills it. Afghanistan\u2019s fielding has been miserable today and they\u2019re punished for this error because a single brings Mossadek back on strike and he immediately clouts four. Two singles follow. 49th over: Bangladesh 254-6 (Mosaddek 28, Shaifuddin 0) Mossadek takes a single off the final ball of the over to retain strike; he\u2019ll be planning an onslaught, though I daresay his team think they\u2019ve enough already. Mushfiqur swings the bat at one, gets underneath part of it, and Nabi catches easily at cover. That\u2019s a brilliant innings, and on this pitch worth at least another 30. 49th over: Bangladesh 251-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 26) Mossadek is enjoying himself, cleansing an ugly full toss through cover, where Nabi dives over it like Bobby Mimms. 48th over: Bangladesh 246-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 21) Nice from Mushfiqur, who manufactures a reverse-sweep that flies just past the flying Hashmatullah at short third man. Then, after a single, Mossadek hits with the spin to earn four by way of cover - that\u2019s a lovely shot. Rashid, though, comes back well, conceding just one more - Mossadek curses himself for missing out, but it\u2019s not at all easy out there. Rashid finishes with 0-52, and has probably hit that point of his career where batsmen know what to expect so he needs to better at his variations, rather than find more of them. 47th over: Bangladesh 236-5 (Mushfiqur 78, Mosaddek 16) Zadran, who\u2019s not had such a good day, returns; Mosaddek smacks his first ball to the fence at long on. Zadran retorts with a yorker but follows that with a wide, after which Mosaddek clumps down the ground; Nabi does really well to skip over from long on and save the boundary. Two dots follow, then a one, and Bangladesh look like they\u2019re going to post something eminently chaseable. 46th over: Bangladesh 227-5 (Mushfiqur 77, Mosaddek 9) Bangladesh have mustered 27 from the last five overs; they\u2019ll be wanting more from these next five, and this one yields seven, without a boundary. That reflects well on the bowlers despite the outfield and track, and badly on the batsmen despite the outfield and track. \u201cElbow\u2019s Neat Little Rows has a (lengthy) vocal refrain of \u2018Ya da, ya da, ya da, ya da\u2019, says David Clifford. \u201cEvery time I hear it I just hear \u2018Yadav, Yadav, Yadav, Yadav.\u201d Incidentally, \u201cYadav\u201d means \u201chis hands\u201d in Hebrew, which is nice for a bowler, just as \u201cemess\u201d, as in MS Dhoni means \u201cultimate truth\u201d. 45th over: Bangladesh 220-5 (Mushfiqur 75, Mosaddek 4) Gulbadin wants this done so brings back Mujeeb; not bad naches for an 18-year-old. But he\u2019s taken for three twos and a one, leaving him with figures of 3-39 from his 10. That\u2019s an excellent job of work. 44th over: Bangladesh 212-5 (Mushfiqur 68, Mosaddek 3) On comes Rashid to target the new man, who gets off the mark with a three to fine third man. Mushfiqur takes a single either side, and he must be wondering if, as the senior batsman, he should be pushing the pace or making sure he stays in. Then, Rashid hits Mosaddek on the pad and asks the umpire if it was too high; the umpire tells him there\u2019s a way to find out, and he knows what that is. 43rd over: Bangladesh 207-5 (Mushfiqur 64, Mosaddek 0) \u201c\u201cAnother one involving Shikhar Dhawan,\u201d says Stephen Cottrell. \u201cFeeling Holy by the Charlatans has a lone \u2018shake it down, shake it down shake it down into which I always transpose the flamboyant Indian opener. Also, I quite like Ramesh Powar\u2019s name in the Yeah Yeah Yeah song by the Flaming Lips.\u201d The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song has got to be one of the worst song titles of all-time. Gulbadin sends down not so much a slower ball as a slowest ball and Mamudallah is through the shot almost before it\u2019s arrived, slapping to mid on where Nabi takes an easy catch. This has been a pretty nifty innings, given the injury. 42nd over: Bangladesh 203-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 25) Nabi sends down three dots before Mahmudullah whacks to cover, where Gulbadin removes his hands from harm\u2019s way; they run two instead of one, raising the fifty partnership. A single follows, and I\u2019m surprised Bangladesh aren\u2019t going because they\u2019ve wickets in hand. 41st over: Bangladesh 200-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 22) Gulbadin returns and Mahmudullah is into him right away, coming forward then somehow fashioning a square drive to the fence! That is an absolute jazzer! A single and a two follow and I daresay both sides will be ok with where we are, which tells us we could be in for a thriller. \u201cIn India,\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma, \u201c\u2018Disco Dancer is a movie from the previous century which became an instant cult classic owing to its display of a dancer trying to live the big life. It\u2019s one of those movies from the past which will not win the award for the best movie in any year, but it\u2019s also one of those movies which you\u2019re always down to see on a free evening. I provide the link below to one of the songs from this enduring film. After hearing it, I can only hope that despite being released in the 20th century, the song must have been written with another player not playing today kept in mind - Mr Anderson!\u201d 40th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mushfiqur 62, Mahmudullah 17) Nabi returns and after a single to each batsman, Maumudullah eases back and crunches over the infield for four to cover. That was a lovely shot, and Bangladesh need more of them; if Afghanistan can limit them to, say, another 60, they\u2019ll fanxct they\u2019ve got a chance. \u201cBa Ba Ba, Babar Azam,\u201d croons Alex Crofts. \u201cHeard this one from a worse for wear England fan at Headingly when Pakistan were in the field a couple of years ago. Now it\u2019s on a loop in my head whenever I watch him...\u201d 39th over: Bangladesh 186-4 (Mushfiqur 61, Mahmudullah 11) Mahmudullah is putting himself through it, taking one to cover then two to midwicket; Shinwari shies wildly, not for the first time today, and yerman forces himself through for an overthrow. One more follows, then Mushfiqur slaps four to fine leg. 38th over: Bangladesh 177-4 (Mushfiqur 54, Mahmudullah 9) Mujeeb returns and, with three wickets so far, earns himself a slip. Four singles and a wide from the over and yerman is furious with the last of those which tells you how confident he\u2019s feeling. \u201cThere are a few instances of eight off a single ball via Law 19.8,\u201d emails Dave Loren. \u201cJohn Wright was a beneficiary in the early eighties when he\u2019d run four and Rod Marsh took an ill-advised shy at the stumps and instead sent it to the rope.\u201d 37th over: Bangladesh 172-4 (Mushfiqur 52, Mahmudullah 7) Mushfiqur\u2019s had enough, picking down the track to monster Dawlat over long on for six - that\u2019s his fifty. Three singles follow, making this Bangladesh\u2019s best over in quite some time. \u201cThere are ODI rankings; why not make use of them?\u201d wonders Uma Venkatraman. \u201cTop eight qualify for the world cup; everyone plays each other twice; top two play the final. It\u2019s not the length of the tournament that will bring spectators in, it\u2019s the quality of the matches.\u201d Because it\u2019s important to grow the game. The biggest event needs to be inclusive, and the plan is to have high-quality matches between everyone, eventually. 36th over: Bangladesh 163-4 (Mushfiqur 44, Mahmudullah 6) Rashid continues, and he\u2019s been much better in his second spell than his first. Mahmudullah picks out point for one, Mushfiqur adds one more, then Mahmudullah totally misjudges its final delivery, which grips and bounces, then misses the edge. On the one hand, that\u2019s good for Afghanistan; on the other, they\u2019ve got to bat in a bit. There\u2019ve been only four boundaries in the innings, and perhaps that\u2019s how to go about the chase: chuck the bat during the powerplay. \u201cI remember in the famous 1982-83 Ashes Test in Melbourne,\u201d says Rocket, \u201clate on the fourth day when England were trying to get Allan Border off strike and bowl to Jeff Thomson - Border hit the last ball of an over hard towards the western square boundary (where we were sitting) and the batsmen were running three. David Gower was running alongside the ball, hoping it would go into the boundary. From memory I think it just did, but we thought he was about to help it on it\u2019s way. We knew that rule, and Australia would have got seven runs rather than four. Which, all things being equal, would have resulted in a tie the next morning!\u201d 35th over: Bangladesh 161-4 (Mushfiqur 43, Mahmudullah 5) A single begins the over and brings Mahmudullah onto strike. He nudges into the covers and looks to run, but Mushfiqur isn\u2019t giving his wicket away for a man on one leg; he sends him back, the throw misses the stumps, and they indulge a languorous overthrow. One more single follows, and it\u2019s now 11 overs since Bangladesh hit a boundary while they\u2019ve not hit a six all innings. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing today, or for a while,\u201d says Rob Hogg, \u201cbut I have found find myself singing Shikhar Dhawan\u2019s name along with the chaps in this.\u201d Any more for any more? 34th over: Bangladesh 157-4 (Mushfiqur 41, Mahmudullah 3) That break probably served Bangladesh more than Afghanistan who, for the first time, will feel in the ascendancy. The batsmen take a single each, then Ma Ma Ma Ma Mahmuduallah Mahmuduallah flicks to midwicket and nobbles a hammy before he can turn for the second; no he doesn\u2019t. He looks to half a calf strain, because it\u2019s that part of his body being bandaged. Mushfiqur then forces him into another single - you\u2019ve got to laugh. \u201cLoving schmice!, frask! and zetz!\u201d emails Peter Salmon. \u201cObviously what we need is Batman retooled as Jewish, and sock!, biff! and bap! etc. replaced. Nah nah nah, Fledermoyz Man!\u201d Batman with added existential dread; he\u2019d be great at a party. 33rd over: Bangladesh 153-4 (Mushfiqur 39, Mahmudullah 1) Afghanistan are bang in this now - Soumya out the road before the closing slog is very helpful, and one more wicket will open up one end. Two from Gulbadin\u2019s latest over, and if his team can keep it tight for the next bit, they\u2019ll force the batsmen to force the issue. In the meantime, it\u2019s drinks. \u201c\u2019Zetz\u2019 is a great word that I\u2019ve never come across before, says Matt Dony. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a lover, not a fighter, so I don\u2019t tend to throw too many punches, but I\u2019d definitely like to start using the word. Am I allowed? Or is that cultural appropriation?\u201d Chutzpah, schmooze, klutz and such tell me that you\u2019re fine. And worry not: I\u2019ve never zetzed anyone in my life, but I still find plenty of contexts to enjoy the word, for example: \u201cYanky definitely did not get sufficiently zetzed on Friday night such that he somehow took a chunk out of his own lip\u201d. 32nd over: Bangladesh 151-4 (Mushfiqur 38, Mahmudullah 0) Anyone else sing Mahmudullah to this? No, there\u2019s on bat involved, but what\u2019s this? It the breaking past leg? No! umpire\u2019s call, and Soumya is gone. \u201cAsking, asking, getting!\u201d exclaims Mark Nicholas. Soumya is trapped by a full one, but is there bat involved? It\u2019s very close... 31st over: Bangladesh 148-3 (Mushfiqur 35, Soumya 3) Gulbadin sends down three dots before Soumya goes for a Red Bull single to mid off and doesn\u2019t bother grounding his bat at the other end; a direct hit makes him wonder, but we go upstairs and he\u2019s fine. Mushfiqur then drives to cover for one more and Soumya chases a wide one to guide two to third man. \u201cYou\u2019re watching this on your keyboard?\u201d asks Geoff Wignall. \u201cHow novel. Re the format how about this simple arrangement:three groups of five, top two from each group plus two best third place teams into the quarter finals? (With some fiendishly complicated tie-break arrangement for third placed teams if needed, understood only by three people at the ICC - or simply let them play each other.)3 7 games in total (without any tie-break) if quarter finals a knockout or 39 if they\u2019re round robin. India get to progress as far as their performance merits, which I realise might be too controversial a notion.\u201d Yes yes, very funny. My keyboard packed up, at which point I experienced intense emotion, which distracted me from the cricket on my screen. You\u2019ll be relieved to know that I am now equanimous once more. 30th over: Bangladesh 143-3 (Mushfiqur 33, Soumya 0) Afghanistan are still in this because every time they\u2019ve needed a wicket they\u2019ve got one but more than that, they\u2019ve got the right one. Meanwhile, Damien Burns gets in touch to resolve our legal issue: \u201cLaw 19.8 in the MCC Laws of Cricket states that: \u2018If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder the runs scored shall be (i) any runs for penalties awarded to either side AND (ii) the allowance for the boundary AND (iii) the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act. Law 18.12(b) (Batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act.\u2019 So the single that the batsman took is awarded as well as the boundary, thereby adding 5 runs to the batting team, and the bastman would retain strike.\u201d So it literally is not cricket. Mujeed gives this one a real tweak, ripping fingers down the back of the ball, and it spins off a length, past the inside edge and raps the pad bang in front. And even in dismissal, Shakib shows his brilliance, eschewing the review because he knows he\u2019s out, even though he\u2019s also him. 30th over: Bangladesh 143-2 (Shakib 51, Mushfiqur 30) Mujeed returns. 29th over: Bangladesh 142-2 (Shakib 51, Mushfiqur 32) Afghanistan have slowed the scoring a little, but badly need to break this partnership. Mushfiqur edges a single - he\u2019s getting full use of his bat here - and two more singles follow. G.L. Sherwood is back in touch to wonder what \u201cshmice\u201d means, and this is one we can be sure I did not make up; it is yiddish for hit hard, and is usually administered to a child by a paren; one sporting team to another; a tin to a person. Other similar terms: \u201cfrask\u201d, which is usually a slap or a swipe, and \u201czetz\u201d, which is usually a punch. 28th over: Bangladesh 139-2 (Shakib 50, Mushfiqur 30) Mushfiqur plays three dots then caresses a single into the covers. This brings Shakib onto strike and he edges to backward square, easing through to raise his fifth fifty of the competition. Brilliant. \u201cModern trends have caused cricket to come off as a batsman\u2019s game,\u201d reckons OB Jato, \u201cbut at heart, I\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s more of a bowler\u2019s game in fair conditions. Many of the matches in this World Cup so far as well as most of the 2018 Test season has proved this notion of bowlers coming out on top more often than not in duels against batters. As Azhar Mahmood said during an interview recently: \u201cIt takes 300 balls to get 480 runs, but it takes only 10 balls to get all 10 wickets.\u201d I\u2019d say that it\u2019s a batsman\u2019s game in that the laws are biased towards batsmen and the bat is usually on top, but it\u2019s a bowler\u2019s game in that great bowlers are less common. In limited overs, I don\u2019t think it matters much if what constitutes good bowling is conceding 60 not 80, or taking two key wickets, not none, but in Tests we need to be more careful. 27th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Gulbadin sends down a much-needed maiden to Shakib \u2013I think that\u2019s the first of the inning \u2013 and I am certain that Shakib isn\u2019t bothered. 26th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Aaargh! Nabi returns and absolutely rinses Mushfiqur with an off break that drifts, grips and turns; the batsman edges, the keeper can\u2019t gather what would\u2019ve been a reaction belter, and they run two. My keyboard then packs up so I miss what comes next, but the scoreboard tells me it\u2019s two singles. 25th over: Bangladesh 132-2 (Shakib 48, Mushfiqur 25) Gulbadin returns and Shakib edges his first delivery for two - there\u2019s no slip in place. As Metternich once said, I wonder what he meant by that. Eight off the over, the fifty partnership raised, and this is beginning to look like a match-settler. \u201cRegarding the format issue,\u201d says Kennedy Ross, \u201cRequirements: 1. We want more teams 2. We want more excitment, less predictability 3. Indians need to be going on to at least semis to keep BCCI happy. The solution would be to let India enter two separate teams, solving all three problems in one move.\u201d Tangentially, I wonder what it\u2019d take to get Virat Kohli involved when he retires. The combination of gravitas, edge and love would be extremely helpful. 24th over: Bangladesh 124-2 (Shakib 41, Mushfiqur 24) On comes Rahmat Shah, who gets away with one first up, short and wide; Shakib cuts hard, but straight to the sweeper at deep point and they run one. What I love about Shakib is most things, but what I\u2019m especially loving about Shakib right now is his equanimity. He misses out, he doesn\u2019t miss out, he lets it go and moves on, the kind of thing that\u2019s contagious. Anyhow, Rahmat cedes two more singles, then Mushfiqur takes a giant stride, stays low, and sweeps an excocet to the point fence. 23rd over: Bangladesh 117-2 (Shakib 39, Mushfiqur 19) Afghanistan are back in need a wicket territory and after Dawlat cedes four from his first three balls, he beats Mushfiqur outside off. Of course, karma takes its revenge, Mushfiqur swinging at the next one and top-edging four over the keeper\u2019s head. Two more follow to third man, and this is getting away from Afghhanistan now - that\u2019s 10 off the over. \u201cWhen Carlos Brathwaite was doing his best to drag West Indies over the line against New Zealand,\u201d emails Adithya, \u201cit struck me that if Brathwaite took a single off the last ball of the over to retain strike, the New Zealand fielder could throw the ball over the boundary in order to make it a four and get the No. 11 batsman on strike. This tactic only has application in a very particular kind of situation. 20-30 runs to defend against an explosive batsman who might knock it off with boundaries and a tailender whose wicket will give you the game. Have you ever seen or heard of any teams resorting to this?\u201d I\u2019ve not, but I like it very much indeed. The problem is the risk, I guess - you\u2019d look pretty silly if it failed - and, of course, though the laws permit it, assuming the laws permit it, it probably \u201cisn\u2019t cricket\u201d. 22nd over: Bangladesh 107-2 (Shakib 36, Mushfiqur 12) This is such clever batting, keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks. Sounds simple, isn\u2019t simple. 21st over: Bangladesh 103-2 (Shakib 35, Mushfiqur 9) This is such a key innings from Shakib. Obviously his team need the runs, but there\u2019s more to it than that - it\u2019s essence of captaincy. Even in cricket, where the job is about more than shouting and cajoling, in the end, its key aspect is leading from the front, especially at crucial times. This, there can be no doubt, is that. He takes two from the first ball of the over, nurdled to mid off, then adds a single to fine leg. Mushfiqur then edges one more, a wide follows, then another single into the leg side and that\u2019s eight from what seemed like quiet over. 20th over: Bangladesh 95-2 (Shakib 31, Mushfiqur 6) Rashid continues and is milked; I wonder if, in years to come, he\u2019ll see this competition as an important staging-post in his development, or just hate playing in England. Six off the over. \u201cAs refreshing as it is to see English supporters politely clap after every boundary or wicket,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the spirit of subcontinental supporters more. Seeing the pure passion of the Afghan fans pleases me to no end. It could well be the sole reason I tune into every match they are at. Even today, they seem to be perennially happy to be here. This contingent is a synecdoche for the sense of pride, nationalism and inspiration sport is meant to encourage. No matter what happens on the pitch today, no admirer of cricket can resist giving their best of luck to Afghanistan and its fans going forward. Here\u2019s to hoping each one of us is as happy and passionate as them about something in our lives, be it our career, our partner, or the thing all souls turn to some time or the other - sport at its glorious best.\u201d I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve correctly characterised an English crowd. It\u2019s like that at Lord\u2019s, but not anywhere else, and even there, we can wonder if the politeness is sincere. But in general I agree, rowdiness and abandon are beauties of sport, provided they\u2019re natural and refrain from cringe. 19th over: Bangladesh 89-2 (Shakib 29, Mushfiqur 2) Dawlat returns and cedes just a single from his first four deliveries, then tries a bouncer that\u2019s also wide, so is called wide. Shakib then opens the face and guides his next ball wide of slip; Asghar does really well to catch up with it and save the boundary as the batsmen run two then have a drink. \u201cWe\u2019re puzzled by the verb \u2018to squanty\u201d\u2019, tweets G.L. Sherwood. \u201cA cursory internet search throws up just one other use, in 2017, by a certain, hang on, er, Daniel Harris. Are you messing with us or what?\u201d Would I ever? I\u2019d love to claim the neologism, but the truth is that those who use it are not really into internets. When you squanty something - you usually squanty it down - you sort it out. It can often relate to a slightly dodgy activity, though it needn\u2019t. 18th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Shakib 27, Mushfiqur 1) Suddenly it\u2019s all going off! Bangladesh are still pretty well-set, but if Afghanistan can find another, everything changes. Or is it! Shakib goes upstairs, and might he just be ok on height? YES HE IS! NOT OUT! Rashid bowls on a length, deceives Shakib with some extra bounce and raps him on the knee-roll! Up goes the fingers, and it\u2019s two in two! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 26) \u201cWhile I\u2019m all for countering the pervasive influence of the ICC BCCI wherever possible,\u201d says Alex Bramble, \u201cthey do occasionally happen on something vaguely intelligent: see the IPL eliminator. So I (and a few other OBOers over the past couple of weeks) suggest: two groups of 7, top-placed team in each group goes straight into the semi-finals, second- and third-placed teams play each other in two \u2018quarter\u2019- finals/eliminators.\u201d Yes, I could live with that. What we need is jeopardy, more teams to grow the game, and enough scope for classics at the business end. What comeback from Nabi, who bowls full and Tamim comes forward when he should go back, plays for more turn than there is, and the clatter tells him what\u2019s up. My word Afghanistan needed that! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 31) Nabi continues and the batsmen take single apiece, then two dots before Tamim absolutely cleanses a short one to the fence at midwicket. 16th over: Bangladesh 76-1 (Tamim 31, Shakib 25) Rashid Khan into the attack, and his team need something from him - he\u2019s only got four wickets in this tournament, and that\u2019s not really enough given his status. The batsmen have a look at him and Tamim takes a two into the leg side. 15th over: Bangladesh 74-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 24) This is really impressive from Bangladesh, who have this track squantied right down; they\u2019re keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks, then meting out treatment to the balls which demand it. This over yields only one, to Shakib, but the platform is set. 14th over: Bangladesh 73-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 23) Tamim loses patience and twinkles down the track as Gulbadin releases to shmice him down the ground for four. Four singles follow, then Shakib attacks a short one that sits up and begs to be hit; he obliges with a pull to the midwicket fence and is now tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer. He and his team are getting away. Incidentally, I have now received about 57 different suggestions for how to structure this thing of ours, which tells you how hard it is. Shall we just have a fight instead? Or perhaps a quiz on Engoish cricket from the mid-80s to the mid-90s. 13th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 20, Shakib 21) Bangladesh will be happy with this. First, Nabi finds so much turn that it costs him a wide, then they milk him for a two and two ones. If these two bat for another 45 minutes, that might just be the game. \u201cThat\u2019s not disrespect for GnR,\u201d says Smylers, \u201cthis is disrespect for GnR \u2014 a cover version I was blissfully unaware of till it featured as a question on PopMaster this morning.\u201d I should add that Sarah O\u2019Regan has since emailed thusly: \u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t mean to slight GnR - far from it - I merely meant that the musician plays it a little too slow and a little too flat to be an accurate representation.\u201d I trust she will now called off her lawyers. 12th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 19, Shakib 18) Gulbadin Naib into the attack and Shakib flips two to backward square to raise Bangladesh\u2019s fifty. Next ball, a leading edge to point - he was looking for midwicket - but with the fielders pushed back, no one was on hand to claim what would\u2019ve been a dolly. I wonder, though, if Gulbadin has missed a trick here - the outfield is slow and his team need wickets, so put men in wicket-taking positions. A two and three singles follow, which is to say that Afghanistan need something and fast. 11th over: Bangladesh 49-1 (Tamim 18, Shakib 12) Mujeeb is struggling to exert pressure here. The batsmen take him for four, a two to Tamim and a single apiece, and I fancy he\u2019ll be getting thanked pretty soon. \u201cSome countries do have special fans,\u201d emails John Starbuck, \u201cnot least Pakistan and West Indies. For England, it\u2019s the whole Barmy Army, which rather puts the kibosh on making a feature of it on the screens. But then, so many people (these days) are so used to appearing on screen, they probably barely notice older followers\u2019 disdain. I was a teenager in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and wouldn\u2019t mind the guitar man if only he learned to play Link Wray\u2019s \u2018Rumble\u2019; a real classic.\u201d Sure, everyone\u2019s special and all that, but the artificial and performative nature of it all makes my teeth itch. I can think of little worse than a day at the cricket next to any kind of army or band. 10th over: Bangladesh 44-1 (Tamim 15, Shakib 10) Tamim shoves one to midwicket, then Nabi offers Shakib some width and he doesn\u2019t need asking twice, clattering four through backward point. A single follows, then Tamim bunts down the ground; they run one, then another when a shy flies past the stumps. That\u2019s Bangladesh\u2019s best over in a while, nine from it. 9th over: Bangladesh 35-1 (Tamim 12, Shakib 4) The pitch is a little slow here, which might make for drama later on, but isn\u2019t great for entertainment in the first instance, a little like in the South Africa-New Zealand match. In limited overs, we don\u2019t necessarily need balance between bat and ball because even on a 400 track, a bowler can make the difference, but if we reckon that a 330-350 track is ideal, you want the ball coming on so there\u2019s pace for the quick and strokemakers, along with dryness for the spinners. One off the over, and that a wide. 8th over: Bangladesh 34-1 (Tamim 12, Shakib 4) Three more singles from the over, and Afghanistan have slowed the socring; can they create a little more pressure? \u201cThe simple and easy answer,\u201d says Nick Parish, \u201cis four groups of four, top two in each group go through to the quarter-finals. Yes, I know it doesn\u2019t guarantee India get 73 games, but how much protection do the big countries need? Football, not normally a good example of anything, manages to deal with it when the big countries don\u2019t make the knockout stage (hello Germany 2018, hello England, Spain and Italy 2014).\u201d I\u2019m not sure about this one - I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be much jeopardy for the bigger nations, who\u2019d largely avoid each other until the end. What I like about the current format is that there are heavyweight contests all the way through. 7th over: Bangladesh 31-1 (Tamim 10, Shakib 3) Tamim takes a single, then Shakib nudges to point and sets off. A better throw from Shinwari and Tamim\u2019s got a situation, but it\u2019s wild and he makes it easily. He then adds another single and is looking nicely settled. 6th over: Bangladesh 28-1 (Tamim 8, Shakib 2) Mohammad Nabi into the attack and Tamim takes him for a single to deep square, the first of three in the over. \u201cI was at Headingley on Friday (I know, Jonah),\u201d says Ben Powell, \u201cand despite the result thoroughly enjoyed the day but for one or two interruptions. The cricket bat guitar and some sort of \u201cgreatest fan\u201d cam that popped up at regular, infuriating intervals. The cricket bat guitar is crass and pointless IMHO (as I understand the kids say), but the greatest fan thing was just hopeless. Every time it came up, cue a couple of nervous looking fans, embarrassingly and half-heatedly waving at the camera, which always lingered just that little too long. Cue also less than zero reaction from the rest of the crowd. I\u2019ve been to baseball and ice hockey in the States and Canada where they do this sort of thing regularly and it goes down a storm. That\u2019s where such manufactured atmosphere should stay. Harrumph.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d agree with that. Let people enjoy the sport and enjoy their company - there\u2019s no need to coordinate their fun for them, or entice them to behave in a particular manner. 5th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Tamim 6, Shakib 1) My days, Afghanistan needed that, not because bangladesh have got away but because their entire strategy is predicated on early wickets. They know they can\u2019t chase a biggie, so need to get to work from the off. I really don\u2019t know! If the soft signal is not out, this is not out, because the evidence is inconclusive - it looks like there are fingers under the ball, but there\u2019s a fair chance it hits the ground nonetheless. Hashmatullah\u2019s head is up so he probably doesn\u2019t know himself, but the umpires have no option: they stay with the onfield decision. And there it is! Liton drives and, down on one knee, Hashmatullah pouches it at short cover ... or is it? The soft signal is out... 4th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Liton 16, Tamim 5) Dawlat overpitches and Liton twizzles him through midwicket, but the damp outfield permits him only three. Tamim then takes strike and plays three dots, before stepping into an uppish drive which flies just wide of Ashar mid off \u2013 he\u2019s far to slow to move \u2013 and to the fence for four. He plays and misses at the next, but that\u2019s no use to Afghanistan, who badly need a breakthrough. \u201cI will leave for you to decide if this is McCullum/Morgan-esque fresh and funky thinking or Fakhar Zaman scooping to first slip idiocy (I know which way I\u2019m leaning)\u201c says Sam Collier, \u201cbut what about some kind of squash ladder affair? A roundrobin, teams initially ordered in reverse ICC ranking with the winning team moving one place above the team they defeat. Top four play semis as per the current format. It\u2019d certainly keep the tension going right to the end...\u201d 3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Liton 13, Tamim 1) Three singles from over, Tamim now off the mark. \u201cIn answer to your question, \u2018How would you make this competition better?\u2019\u201d, emails Sarah O\u2019Regan, \u201cI suggest incorporating more national musical instruments, to replace the cricket bat guitar and its lugubrious Guns n\u2019 Roses dirge. In its place, the outgoing batsman should nip over to the music stage, play a jolly little ditty on a didgeridoo, a dafli daf, or a rubab, before heading off for the walk of shame.\u201d I\u2019d lap that up \u2013 tangentially, I\u2019ve long since argued that national anthems should be in the national style; basically, what I\u2019m saying is that God Save the Queen needs to be a jungle track, and what I\u2019m also saying is that I\u2019m a teenager of the early nineties, so I\u2019m not having that disrespect for GnR. 2nd over: Bangladesh 13-0 (Liton 11, Tamim 0) Dawlat Zadran starts with two dots, both pitched up, but then a shorter one allows Liton to play off the back foot and he times it away beautifully, behind square on the off side - and for extra points, it tantalises Mujeeb into a long, fruitless chase and dive. Glorious. Two dots follow, then a single. 1st over: Bangladesh 8-0 (Liton 6, Tamim 0) Good start for Bangladesh, Liton taking a single from Mujeeb\u2019s loosener and two wides follow. Liton then cuts a wide one and Rahmat Shah makes a right pig\u2019s arse of the stop, allowing the ball by him and to the fence. A single follows, and already Afghanistan are under pressure. How would you make this competition better? More teams, I\u2019d say, then maybe two big groups, and we probably need quarter-finals. On the one hand, that\u2019s a lot of games to eliminate not a lot of teams, but those knockouts will draw casual viewers, tutor them in the ways of righteousness, and induct them into this thing of ours. With just semis and a final, we\u2019re asking too much from just three matches. Afghanistan huddle. I reckon they\u2019re discussing whether it\u2019s a barm or a bun. Right, anthem time. The intro to Afghanistan\u2019s sounds not unlike Jump Around. Mathematics corner: I was wondering what people did in offices before the internet, and if the following equation is true. Work facilitated by the internet = work not done on account of the internet. Otherwise, how has productivity taken a colossal nosedive? \u201cSo, Virat Kohli has been filed his fees for showing dissent,\u201d emails Amod Paranjape. \u201cDissent my ass. It was pure and simple bullying and intimidation. We should not go on to win the World Cup. But since the universe rarely gives people what they want, we are sure to win it. Eh.\u201d I see what you\u2019re trying to do there. I don\u2019t know, though \u2013 I suppose I tend to err on the side of caution when handing out punishments for stuff that\u2019s central to the drama, edge and attitude of the game - if an umpire can\u2019t stand up to a player, then I\u2019m not certain the problem lies with the player. I also wonder what happens to the money. Both captains have made two changes. Afghanistan leave out Aftab Alam and Hazratullah Zazai, replaced by Dawlat Zadran and Samiullah Shinwari. As such, Rahmat Shah moves up the order to open instead of Zazai. Bangladesh, meanwhile, leave out Rubel Hossain and Sabbir Rahman, with Mosaddek Hossain and Mohammad Saifuddin coming in. I\u2019m really looking forward to watching Afghanistan\u2019s spinners - Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman offer such variety and nous. And, though Mark Nicholas and Ian Smith think their team should\u2019ve batted, what\u2019s the point in having good bowlers if they\u2019re trying to defend 180? That sounds sensible to me - if they don\u2019t bat well, the match is over before it\u2019s started. On the other hand, their bowling is their strong suit, so if they deploy it at the start, they can take control and hang on. Ian Smith isn\u2019t sure why, but thinks he\u2019d bat. While we wait, wrap yer peepers around this \u2013 I love love love Tony Cozier. Wendy Crozier, not so much \u2013 though these days, we\u2019d probably call her Wendy Crozeiyay. The toss has been delayed by 10 minutes, and will now be at 10.10am local time. It looks on the John Major side of grey in Southampton, but we should be good to go on time. Public service announcement: I just put on the radio, and heard a minute of a phone-in about Boris Johnson. With every fibre of my being, I urge you not to do the same, which is to say: thank expletive for cricket. Swing the mood. At the risk of sound parochial, you\u2019ve got to love Eoin Morgan\u2019s brave, young England side. Not only are they the greatest one-day outfit there will ever be, but they are also the most altruistic. In deliberately losing to Sri Lanka, they have, in one fell swoop, revitalised their home World Cup. Because of their unique gifts, matches which meant nothing now mean something, and the world is a better place on their account. Just ask Bangladesh. If they beat Afghanistan today, then India and Pakistan as well, they are through \u2013 provided Sri Lanka lose to South Africa, West Indies and India, and England only beat one of Australia, India and New Zealand. And they are capable of doing it. They have plenty of batting, canny bowling, and in Shakib al Hasan have an absolute star. Currently, he is the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer \u2013 with a higher strike-rate than both David Warner and Joe Root, who lie first and third \u2013 while his bowling is threatening, his leadership absolute and his mentality unflappable. If his team are to do it, it will probably be because of him. Afghanistan, meanwhile, are 0 and 6, but just the other day gave India an almighty fright. That will have fired their confidence, and helped them believe that they can put everything together \u2013 they have plenty of talent, but are still learning the knowhow that will extract the most from it. Yes, they\u2019re a dog, but they\u2019re a live dog. Play: 10.30am BST"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
