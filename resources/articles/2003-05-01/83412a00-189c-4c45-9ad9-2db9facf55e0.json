Reality TV was stretched to the limit as Castleford, trailing 26-8, scored three tries in the last nine minutes to snatch the first, and unlikeliest, draw of the Super League season. They were helped hugely by a Hull team who seemed to knock off for the bank holiday midway through the second half, especially their otherwise outstanding captain Richie Barnett, who gave the second of the Tigers' three comeback tries to Michael Eagar. When Danny Orr had darted over for his second try in the 71st minute to cut the deficit to 12, it had seemed merely a consolation. But when, five minutes later, Eagar gobbled up Barnett's crazy pass, handing Wayne Bartrim another easy conversion, Cas were back within a try and a goal. Cas started to attack with conviction and Orr caught Hull short of numbers on the opposite flank with a precise kick, allowing Damian Gibson to dummy over. Bartrim landed his fifth goal from as many attempts, and somehow the Tigers had avoided a third consecutive home defeat. Their coach Graham Steadman, however, was not fooled. \"I'm fuming,\" he said. \"If somebody had said to me with 10 minutes to play that we'd get a point, I'd have thought they were mad.\" There was a further blow for Hull: their wing Matt Crowther broke a leg, joining Jason and Tony Smith on the injury list. But their Australian hooker Dean Treister slotted in well less than 48 hours after arriving from Sydney, and Barnett set a captain's lead on defence in addition to scoring two tries - both set up by Chris Chester, who relished a rare chance at loose forward and laid on another for Steve Prescott. Castleford's only response was a controversial score from Orr after the referee Bob Connolly seemed to miss two Tigers knock-ons in the build-up. But that did not seem to matter as Richard Horne scored a fine individual try early in the second half, then Colin Best took Paul Cooke's reverse flick to cross on the right and give Hull their 26-8 lead. The Tigers supporters in the 8,713 crowd asked, loudly and crudely, what on earth was going on. Half an hour later, the Jungle was less restless but just as confused.
