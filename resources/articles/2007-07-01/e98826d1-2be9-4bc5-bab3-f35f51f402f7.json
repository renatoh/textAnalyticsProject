There was Dinesh Karthik And His Amazing Dropped Sitter, Lord Snooty (aka Sourav Ganguly) And His Incredible Dive Over The Ball not to mention RP Singh And His Mind Boggling Wides. Circuses are in decline in India, as elsewhere, but yesterday the old ringmaster Rahul Dravid was overseeing something of a revival. There was no exploding car or trapeze act and it was tempting to check the ticket in case a refund was due. There was, at times, an exaggerated ineptitude about India's bowling and fielding that was comical. Not that Dravid saw the funny side of things, double tea-potting in fury when Ganguly let the ball go underneath his body on the boundary. His most experienced player, Sachin Tendulkar, did not set a good example, letting the ball go through him at midwicket. Zaheer Khan, at mid-off, chugged across to meet the ball and then followed it to the boundary. It was like watching two elderly friends meeting up for a gentle jog. The highlight, though, was Karthik, at point, who not only dropped the slow, looping catch but lost his cap in the process. He appeared to have been hit by a shell. India, like Pakistan, have rarely been much good in the field but this side looks particularly unathletic. As for the bowling, the England batsmen needed butterfly nets to make contact with some deliveries. One Singh wide was stopped by Tendulkar at first slip, who made a sliding, football-style tackle to his right. India's three main seamers failed to take a wicket between them until late in the day. On this evidence Anil Kumble is in for a busy half-summer. The ball swung. At least, it did so until they changed it in the 36th over, after which it went as straight as an arrow. And no one had any pace. Zaheer Khan, Sri Sreesanth and Singh need assistance and this pitch gave them none. In the field, India scarcely look a Test side. Take away their three all-time greats, Tendulkar, Dravid and Kumble, and they would be very weak indeed. All this would not have mattered very much were it not for the fact that this stillborn cricket season was meant to come to life yesterday. Lord's looked as grand as an ocean liner, humming with expectation, anxious to forget bad memories. The season, so far, has been sodden and anti-climatic. The West Indies were awful, at least until the one-day stuff started. India, we were promised, would provide a sterner challenge. Unlike the West Indies they had played significant cricket. But they were poor yesterday. And the weather forecast for today was bad enough to persuade one to go in search of ark wood. Many of those able to switched the television over to the golf. When they came off, for the first time, at 4.52, it was like a mercy killing. \"If you don't want to watch the cricket you can go to the zoo,\" said David Gower as the Sky cameras gazed over Regent's Park Cricket is not much fun when batsmen enjoy an easy dominance. It would be nice to say that Andrew Strauss returned to form. Nice but not true. He scored 96 but there was that a dropped chance and he rarely looked at his best. At the moment the Middlesex batsman seems to think his feet are there only to keep his knees off the ground. Alastair Cook played well. But he tends to when bowlers target his right hip. The England captain Michael Vaughan played extremely well. One on-drive was a gem and his trademark swivel-pull was occasionally unwrapped. But what did it mean against bowling of this quality? India do tend to perform badly away from home and England, of course, can only beat what is put in front of them. But after the worst winter in their history it is difficult to say whether England have made significant progress under their breezy new coach Peter Moores. They regressed at the end of yesterday's play. At 6.35 the sun came out and India took two quick wickets but, from their point of view, it did not compensate for what had gone before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
