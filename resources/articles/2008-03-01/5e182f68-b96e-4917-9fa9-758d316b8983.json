McCain was invited to a private lunch with the president followed by an official ceremony in the Rose Garden. The endorsement comes eight years after Bush destroyed McCain's hopes of securing the presidency in the 2000 primaries. \"A while back I don't think many people would have thought that John McCain would be here as the nominee of the Republican Party,\" Bush said, appearing with McCain in the White House Rose Garden. \"John showed incredible courage, strength of character and perseverance in order to get to this moment and that's exactly what we need in a president - somebody who can handle the tough decisions, somebody who won't flinch in the face of danger.\" Addressing concerns that his endorsement could backfire on McCain with some groups of voters, Bush said: \"If my showing up and endorsing him helps him - or if I'm against him and it helps him - either way, I want him to win,\" he said. \"This is an age-old question that every president has had to answer, and there is an appropriate amount of campaigning for me to do. But they're not going to be voting for me.\" McCain swept to victory in four races last night - Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont - which took his delegate count beyond the 1,191 needed to secure the Republican nomination. Mike Huckabee, the last serious rival standing in his way, backed out of the contest vowing to inject all his energies into the McCain campaign. The victory of the senator for Arizona marked one of the most remarkable come backs in US political history. Last summer he was all but written off as a candidate but he managed to turn his controversial support for the Bush surge of troop numbers in Iraq to his advantage. He acknowledged the turn around when he said in his victory speech that the nomination was \"an accomplishment that once seemed to more than a few doubters unlikely\". He now faces a crucial opportunity to gather his forces over the next few weeks while the Democrats are still battling away. The top priority will be to refill his campaign coffers to put him in a position better to compete with the lavishly funded campaigns of either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. \"The Democrats will have to spend all their money for weeks to come on beating up on each other,\" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Washington. McCain will also be able to use the breathing space to perfect his message. Judging by his speech yesterday, he will continue to put Iraq and security high on the agenda. That could be risky if Iraq slumps back into violence. But with Clinton and Obama increasingly attacking each other over national security, that arguably is doing McCain's work for him. \"The longer the Democrats tear into each other, the more they create issues and hand data and material for McCain to use against them,\" said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has advised four Republican presidents. McCain will seek to underline his foreign affairs credentials with a trip later this month to the UK, Iraq and Israel. McCain has indicated that he will soon begin the job of choosing a running-mate. The process could be lengthy as the senator may be tempted to wait to know who his Democratic opponent will be before making a decision. Early speculation has thrown up names such as senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, who might appeal as a woman on the ticket; Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida which could be a key state in November; and Mike Huckabee who would help win over the religious right though is not popular among economic conservatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
