It was a sensational performance by the Spaniard, a full 24 shots better than his opening-day score when the tournament was played here in 1999. More immediately, it put him ahead of the rest of the field, headed by his Ryder Cup colleague Paul McGinley, who finished the day two shots back, and a three-shot margin over a group including the young Irish amateur Rory McIlroy. \"When I rolled in a birdie putt on the 1st hole I turned to my caddie and said, 'That's four better than the last time',\" Garc\u00eda said - a reference to the triple bogey with which he started his disastrous first round eight years ago. \"But this was not about revenge. I just wanted to play solidly.\" Yet even in his moment of redemption Garc\u00eda had to cede a share of the spotlight to a hapless rules official and to the man around whom the world of golf seemingly revolves. Tiger Woods, for it is he, stepped off the final green and pronounced himself both satisfied with an opening-round 69 and bemused at a ruling on the 10th hole after his ball had come to rest against some television cables. The R&amp;A match referee declared the cables \"immovable\", thereby allowing the world No1 a free drop from a poor lie in the rough. Woods took advantage by turning a possible bogey into an exquisite par. \"It was a weird ruling,\" he said afterwards. \"I didn't ask for it [the drop]. The guy gave it to me. I was as surprised as anybody.\" That is open to debate, not least because one witness was outraged by what he perceived to be favouritism. \"In 21 years I have never seen a ruling like it. I was disgusted,\" declared the former European tour player Mark Roe, who witnessed the incident while commentating for the BBC. \"The R&amp;A official became a jellyfish as soon Tiger Woods became involved.\" Roe, of course, was the victim of the rules at the 2003 Open, when he was disqualified for accidentally signing for the wrong score. The R&amp;A stood its ground then, and it stood its ground yesterday. \"I know what the rules are perfectly well. The idea that Tiger Woods got favourable treatment is ridiculous,\" said Alan Holmes, the official who made the ruling. On the off chance that the second round today will be entirely devoted to golf, the possibilities are lip-smacking. In the trawl to find Europe's first major champion since the last millennium Garc\u00eda's name has been less prominent than ever before, mostly because he has shown an abject lack of touch on the greens. Dire straits demand drastic measures and he walked on to the 1st tee yesterday with a belly putter in his bag. The effect was immediate. Two birdies and seven pars on the front nine was impressive but five birdies on the back nine, by far the harder half, was outrageous. He has long been peerless as a ball-striker but now it seems he can putt. \"I feel like I am rolling the ball nicely. I've just been trying to get the best routine and it looks like I've done it,\" he said. Equally awaited will be McIlroy's second round. The 18-year-old has long been known to the cognoscenti as one of the amateur game's finest talents, not least because he has filled cabinets with trophies since he won the world junior championship at the age of nine. He also won the European amateur championship in Italy last year - a victory that entitled him to a place in the field at Carnoustie. A product of Holywood golf club in County Down, he is clearly an exponent of Hollywood golf. A plethora of fancied players including Justin Rose (who shot a four-over-par 75), Colin Montgomerie (73) and the US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy (75) would have paid handsomely for the youngster's three birdies and 15 pars. The same applies to his playing partners, Henrik Stenson and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, who shot 71 and 69 respectively. God himself, as McIlroy was quick to point out, was also beaten by a shot. He said: \"I was really nervous for the first few holes but I birdied the 5th and got into my stride. It is a special feeling to say you out-scored Tiger Woods, and to outscore your playing partners is awesome.\" Leaderboard b&gt; 1 Sergio Garc\u00eda Sp -6 2 Paul McGinley Ire -4 =3 Michael Campbell NZ -3 =3 Markus Brier Aut -3 =3 Angel Cabrera Arg -3 =3 Rory McIlroy* NIre -3 =3 Boo Weekley US -3 =8 KJ Choi SKor -2 =8 Tiger Woods US -2 =8 Stewart Cink US -2 =8 Padraig Harrington Ire -2 =8 Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez Sp -2 * denotes amateur"}, "isHosted": false}}}
