The 16-year-olds were killed instantly when they were struck shortly after 9.10pm on Friday by a Stansted Express travelling at nearly 80mph on its way from Liverpool Street to Stansted airport. The driver of the train reported seeing five youths on the tracks as his train approached the gated crossing at Pegamoid Road, Edmonton, which is operated by pedestrians opening a spring-loaded gate. There are no lights or warning signals on the crossing. He braked and sounded his horn, but struck two of the teenagers. The other youths fled before emergency services arrived. British Transport police yesterday appealed for them to come forward. The crossing is in the middle of a straight length of track with good views from the crossing in both directions. A spokesman for British Transport police said there were other pedestrian crossings on high speed lines on the rail network. A postmortem is being carried out on the boys. Police said they had not yet named them because formal identification had yet to be made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
