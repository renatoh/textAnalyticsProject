As Jimmy Greaves almost certainly never said, it's been a World Cup of two halves. On one hand, the players have been doing their best to hit the headlines. One of them warmed us all up by obligingly taking an illegal substance, and since then several have scored hundreds, taken five-fors or simply retired. On the other hand, the administrators refuse to be elbowed aside. And - in a paragraph full of bodily appendages - it is at them that the finger should be pointed. Governing bodies get the World Cups they deserve. It's true that the ICC couldn't have done anything about Australia's supremacy, but if they had placed cricket ahead of money, they could have prevented the Super Six turning into the Flaccid Four (or even - given the disintegration of Sri Lanka - the Threadbare Three). Their refusal to listen to the legitimate concerns of England meant that Zimbabwe got through by virtue of wins over Holland and Namibia, a walkover and a thunderstorm. And their refusal to listen to New Zealand's worries about travelling to Nairobi meant that Kenya started the Super Six needing only two washouts to qualify for the semi-finals. It's far too early for us to be asking the only real question that remains to be answered: can either India or New Zealand stop the Aussies? As Scyld Berry pointed out on Sunday, it makes you wish the game was run by cricket-loving ex-players rather than lawyers. Ex-players would have scheduled rest days for every group game (in which case West Indies and England might still be with us). And recent ex-players would have insisted on demystifying Duckworth-Lewis by updating the latest position at the end of every over on the scoreboard as they do in county cricket (in which case South Africa might not be in mourning). These are little but obvious details which the ICC, in their desire for a money-spinning, pan-African dream, have forgotten about. As things have turned out, two out of three of the home sides have got beyond the group stage. That sounds good, but the only problem is South Africa aren't among them. Great in theory, less so in practice - off the field, at least, it's been that kind of World Cup. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o QUOTE OF THE WEEK \"We all had a bit of a laugh about it, at Darren's expense I suppose\" - Ricky Ponting strikes another blow for race-relations in the build-up to Australia's Super Six game with Sri Lanka by explaining his side's sensitive reaction to Darren Lehmann's racially dubious outburst at Brisbane in January. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o SILLY POINT: FOOD FIGHTS Call the Spin a stirrer if you will, but it had rather been enjoying the spectacle. By the time you read this, Australia and New Zealand will already be swapping unpleasanteries on the field in Port Elizabeth. But the true battle for bragging-rights Down Under went on where it mattered: in the school-canteen, ya-boo-sucks environment of the pre-match press conferences. At the time of writing, the Spin hears that Antipodean antipathy has reached a new childish low, and helpful old dinner ladies are getting splattered by flying dollops of trans-Tasman testosterone. In the kangaroo corner, it's Ricky's gang. Splat! And in the Kiwi corner, it's Chris's gang. Splurge! \"We will know pretty much what to expect,\" said Ricky Ponting, as a flying saveloy brushed his right ear. \"In Colombo [at last year's ICC Champions Trophy] we managed to make more than 300 batting first and then knocked them over and I am sure they will still have memories of that.\" But Chris Cairns was having none of it. \"I feel I'm simmering,\" he muttered irrelevantly as he aimed a spoonful of toad-in-the-hole at Ricky's gang. \"They do have a certain mystique but we don't fear them.\" As Brad Hogg copped an eyeful of semolina before being led off in tears, Cairns nodded menacingly and added, \"We'll be seeing what he's made of.\" Back came Ponting with a well-aimed fistful of blancmange. \"Once Hoggy gets a bit of a sniff and gets on top he tends to bowl a lot better,\" he countered. Ricky's gang taunted Chris's gang, and Chris's gang pulled faces at Ricky's gang, but Stephen Fleming rose above it all. \"I'm not concerned,\" he oozed, regally swaying out of the way of a short-pitched beefburger. \"I have heard it all before, I think we've all heard it before. They target key opposition players, following on from the example set by Steve Waugh. He was very good at using the media for his own ends. I'm not tempted to follow suit, it's just a waste of breath, really.\" Plucking an errant portion of apple crumble out of thin air, Fleming sauntered off. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o COW CORNER: FROM BROTHER, WITH LOVE An intriguing little tale of sibling rivalry arrives fresh from the pages of this month's Wisden Cricket Asia magazine. It concerns some less-than-filial comments made by Snehashish Ganguly about his younger brother, Sourav, who apparently captains India in his spare time. First, the background: when, in 1989-90, Sourav made his debut in the Ranji Trophy (like the English County Championship, except everyone scores 650 for 4 declared) he took the place of none other than Snehashish, who may or may not still be foaming at the mouth. Thirteen years later, Snehashish appears to have wrought his awful revenge. Writing in the Indian Marxist newspaper, Ganashakti, the day after India were humbled for 125 by Australia at Centurion, Snehashish twisted the knife with gratuitous glee. \"Can any sane person nick such a wide ball?\" he cackled in reference to Sourav's dismissal by Brett Lee. \"It appeared,\" he continued, \"that Sourav's mind is not at all on the cricket. If he carries on like this, not only will he lose the captaincy, he will be dropped from the first XI.\" Sourav's political leanings aren't known to the Spin, though it suspects that Communism isn't high on the list. Even so, word clearly got back to him - and the results have been electrifying. In five innings since his brother's words of advice, Sourav has smashed 262 runs at an average of 87.33 and a strike-rate of 84, and India have qualified for the semi-finals. Snehashish was last seen wandering the streets of Calcutta telling anyone who would listen that he had been taken out of context. He loved his brother, really. Really, he did.
