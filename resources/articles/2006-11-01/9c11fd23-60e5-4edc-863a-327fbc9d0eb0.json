This was long after the original OJ murder took place, but not so long after it that some story couldn't be wrung out if it every couple of weeks. When anything OJ would actually happen, it would be like a captain yelling \"all hands on deck\" during a storm - or at least the way they look in the movies. Time would stop while we became the all-OJ, all the time, network. Since OJ had no power, and was not going to sue us, almost anything at all was fair game about the guy. Once during a discussion of Clinton's infidelities I mentioned that there were lots of similar stories to be told about network executives, including one that was featured in New York Magazine that same week. We got a call from the network guy's office before the segment was over and I was nearly fired. But with OJ, you could say he was addicted to necrophilia and conducted human sacrifices in his backyard, using only Pygmy children imported explicitly for that purpose, and it was cool with the brass. Knowledge was not not only not necessary, it was not even helpful. Well here we go again, and not in a good way. OJ is cashing in on his infamy with a book about how he would have done it, if he had, which he may have, but he's not telling. In fact it's not just OJ who's back - they're all back. My friend Jeff Toobin is back on CNN opining about the whole thing. Ron Goldman's sister and father appeared on CNN's Larry King Live to ask people to \"shun the book, shun the show, send a message loud and clear.\" (Where do I sign?) The publisher this time is Judith Reagan, who will interview Simpson about the book Monday night on Fox, in a kind of seamless web of sleaze. (The head Little Brown, way back when, saw her head disappear on a chopping block after she paid $3 million for a book by OJ's girlfriend, that did not meet, um, expectations. She's gone from publishing and I can't remember her name, even though I had a book under contract to the same house at the time.) Regan defends her publication with the argument that \"this is an historic case, and I consider this his confession.\" I can promise you she's not going to be losing her job anytime soon. Is there any news executive anywhere who can defend OJ's self-serving, cash-seeking re-emergence as newsworthy? I'd be amazed. But will any of the cable networks in the United States avoid the topic? To ask the question is to answer it. There are a lot of forces lining up to cripple the news business these days, from Wall Street to the White House. But there's an enemy within as well. And you can tune into Judith Regan's program on Fox Monday night to see it in action. Now back to your Michael Jackson news..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
