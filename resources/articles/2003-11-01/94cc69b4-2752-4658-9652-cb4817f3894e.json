As the coach stood in the hotel where the squad will be based, it was possible to sense the excitement of a major tournament in the near future. The reality of the event took shape and, with it, the kind of hard conclusion that saw James Beattie omitted from the squad for the friendly with Denmark at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Southampton forward, despite his present lull, has struck more league goals this season (seven) than Darius Vassell, Wayne Rooney and Emile Heskey combined (three), yet they are all in the party to his exclusion, although Rooney's flu may yet rule him out. Not even the injury that sidelines Michael Owen could bring Beattie a reprieve. The coach cannot visualise a role for him in his ideal of fast, streamlined football. \"My message is to keep on working hard and to keep scoring goals,\" Eriksson said. \"You never know.\" Alan Smith of Leeds United has to suffer the same tepid encouragement. Neither man can expect to be with England in Portugal and they will not be reflecting on the Football Association's interesting choice of accommodation. The Solplay Hotel is an excellent establishment even if it does not possess the drop-dead chic associated with millionaire footballers. Six miles from Lisbon on the road to Cascais, its location is a prime asset and the FA claims it managed to book in ahead of Italy and France. With airport and motorways highly accessible, England plan to reside there no matter where they might have to travel for their matches. Better still, England have a glorious training ground and national sports centre in a nearby park. They will go through their preparations in the bucolic surroundings of the Estadio Nacional. Although the ground is not a Euro 2004 venue, the Portuguese Cup final continues to be played there. Eriksson won the trophy with Benfica in that stadium. England beat Portugal 10-0 there in 1947 and, 20 years later, Celtic became the first British club to win the European Cup by beating Internazionale on its turf. The England squad will relish the ambience of the Estadio Nacional, but their hotel may leave them slightly nonplussed. Although most players will have a two-bedroom apartment which usually costs \u00a3190 a night, the public areas may surprise them. They are accustomed to moneyed seclusion, but the outdoor pool is overlooked by flats. Photographers, having paid off the owners, could turn the development's row of balconies into a snappers' alley next summer. Eriksson will be relaxed over a return to a city where his connections include a home he seldom uses and a recently started legal action against Benfica over money he has allegedly been owed since the early 1990s. His mind, of course, is really on the windfall of possible glory at Euro 2004. England will gear them selves up for it with two matches that are to open and close a three-team tournament in the north-west of England at the start of June. The coach is working on the assumption that Rio Ferdinand will be present for them, even if the charge he faces over a missed drug test mean that he is absent this week. \"I hope the story has ended by then,\" Eriksson said when asked if he feared that the Manchester United defender would be suspended from the finals. He conceded that, in theory, he could act as a character witness if necessary, but saw no real merit in telling a disciplinary commission that Ferdinand is valuable to club and country. In addition to Owen Hargreaves, Paul Scholes, Kieron Dyer and Owen, Sol Campbell and Jonathan Woodgate are also injured. With the shortage of defenders, the 33-year-old Gareth Southgate returns for the first time this season despite criticising the coach in a recent book. \"Everyone has an opinion and we have to accept that,\" said Eriksson, just as emollient as the Middlesbrough centre-back alleges. It is not thought that the two will be together for long since it is only circumstances that bring novelty this week. Eriksson has included the uncapped Glen Johnson and Scott Parker, but there will be no vacancies for them next summer if everyone is fit. Johnson, in fact, is suspended for one competitive match after his red card for the Under-21s in Turkey and could not take part in England's opening fixture at Euro 2004. There were no surprises yesterday. That is precisely how Eriksson likes it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
