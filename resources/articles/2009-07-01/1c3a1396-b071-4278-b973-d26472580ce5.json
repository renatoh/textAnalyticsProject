Ben\u00edtez remains furious with Barry for opting to join City last month, with the Liverpool manager claiming that the wages on offer in Manchester \u2013 the 28-year-old is understood to be earning around \u00a3130,000-a-week \u2013 were the sole motivation for his decision. O'Neill, however, has revealed Liverpool failed to submit an offer and, though \"surprised\" at Barry's choice of club, suggested that Ben\u00edtez had taken the signing of the midfielder for granted. \"I had said to Gareth's agent before that we were not going to have the same debacle as last year and that they were perfectly at liberty to speak to, I assumed, the top four teams,\" said O'Neill. \"Liverpool were aware of the price that we were asking if that was the case. Liverpool did not contact us directly at all in this matter and never offered any money for him so you get the impression that, eventually, it was a straight choice. \"I'm not protecting anybody here,\" continued the Villa manager. \"I was a bit surprised that Gareth mentioned about the Champions League [before] going [to City] \u2013 that's people's prerogative. But Liverpool had not put a bid in and we hadn't heard anything from them. There was an agent working supposedly on their behalf but no offer had been forthcoming and Gareth left. If he wanted to leave, that was up to him. Where he went to was obviously a bit of a surprise.\" Asked whether he thought Liverpool took it for granted that Barry was going to move to Anfield, O'Neill replied: \"They may well have done.\" Liverpool are also believed to be interested in signing Ashley Young but O'Neill will strongly resist any approach for the England player. Ben\u00edtez is reported to be preparing a \u00a320m offer for the 24-year-old but Villa's valuation is \u00a310m higher and even then the Midlands club would be reluctant to part with their most valuable asset. O'Neill, who watched an under-strength Villa side defeat Peterborough 3-0 on Saturday, is hopeful that he can add to the squad before Villa get their preparations for the Peace Cup under way with their first training session in Spain on Thursday. O'Neill, whose only signing hitherto is Stewart Downing from Middlesbrough, is continuing to pursue Sylvain Distin, though a fee has yet to be agreed with Portsmouth. His other priority is to fill the sizeable hole left by Barry's departure. \"We are looking for immediate replacements for the likes of Martin Laursen and Gareth and we're pressing on with that,\" he added. \"We have inquired about quite a number of people and, of the ones that we would like in, I couldn't tell you that we would have anybody in by Thursday. It would be fantastic to have somebody by Thursday, but if not, it doesn't mean that I can't travel back and sort things out. In an ideal world I would like people in at least fortnight before the Premiership. But a week in advance would be no major problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
