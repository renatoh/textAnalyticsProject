Deon Burton's 12th goal of the season extended the visitors' unbeaten run to 10 matches, an impressive sequence that should ensure that Brian Laws and his fast-improving players delay booking any summer holidays. Albion still cannot be sure how they will be spending next month. Tony Mowbray's side, unconvincing here as they slipped to a fifth successive home match without a win, remain in fourth place but this result will encourage those in pursuit. The home disappointment was not merely confined to the result with Neil Clement, receiving a straight red card for headbutting Leon Clarke, and Darren Carter, picking up a second booking for a foul on the same player, both sent off. Mowbray's side may have peppered Iain Turner's goal with shots from distance in the opening 45 minutes but it was Wednesday who came closest to a breakthrough. Having been denied two reasonable penalty claims, when Sam Sodje bundled into Burton and later following Paul McShane's apparent handball, Steve MacLean should have opened the scoring. Sodje, prone to moments of carelessness, dropped his attempted back-pass woefully short, allowing the Wednesday forward to seize possession and round Dean Kiely. The striker was not totally in control of the ball, though, and as the angle narrowed he could only drag his shot into the side-netting. Diomansy Kamara had already troubled that area at the opposite end, wasting a good chance when his hesitation enabled Richard Wood to block. That lack of conviction in front of goal plagued Albion during the first half, with promising possession bringing opportunities in the final third that a more incisive team would have taken. Nathan Ellington, along with Kamara, carried the burden, hooking wide from eight yards in the 36th minute after he had twice seen shots blocked by Wednesday's captain Lee Bullen. Turner had already denied Darren Carter and Zoltan Gera from further out. That Albion were being forced to attempt such speculative shots was a measure of how prosaic their approach had become. Penetration was lacking and the home team's wastefulness was punished 14 minutes into the second period. Chris Brunt delivered an inviting cross which Burton, under pressure from Paul Robinson, turned over the line despite Kiely's admirable attempts to claw the ball clear. The lead might have been doubled 10 minutes later, with Brunt's dipping free-kick forcing Kiely to make an uncomfortable save. Albion's response was muted although Kamara, wastefully heading wide Martin Albrechtsen's cross, wasted an excellent chance to equalise. It was a miss he repeated in the 89th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
