The home team had conceded 10 goals in losing their three previous league games, but looked more resolute against Hearts. They could not hold out for even a point, however, as the visitors followed up on their midweek success against Celtic with Kyle's 65th-minute penalty. Hearts almost doubled their lead on 68 minutes when Rudi Skacel set up Stephen Elliott for a fierce strike, which was pushed wide by Peter Enckelman. Saints introduced Sam Parkin and he was soon involved, forcing a fine save from Marian Kello after a Peter MacDonald pass. The home side kept battling to rescue at least a point but it was Hearts who scored in the final minute of stoppage time, as a searching pass from Calum Elliott found the substitute Ryan Stevenson, who finished well with a low drive. Hearts' stylish second-half performance heaped more misery on out-of-form St Johnstone. Derek Riordan repaid the faith of the Hibernian manager, Colin Calderwood, by netting a double to overturn Motherwell's early lead at Easter Road. Nick Blackman netted the opener after controversial referee Dougie McDonald had given Motherwell a penalty on his return to SPL action. But Riordan, recalled after suspension, twice took advantage of hesitancy in the Motherwell defence to put the hosts in front at half-time. Riordan grabbed his second in the 27th minute after another assist from Valdas Trakys, although his clear-cut chance owed more to 'Well captain Stephen Craigan, who should have cleared after Trakys had headed on a Mark Brown clearance but missed his kick to allow Riordan a clear run on goal, and the former Celtic player calmly slotted into the corner from 12 yards to seal a 2-1 victory. Inverness Caley Thistle continued their good form with an impressive 3-1 win at Hamilton. Two goals from Adam Rooney helped the visitors come back from a goal behind to win 3-1 at Hamilton and extend their near year-long record of remaining undefeated in away league action. The forward netted twice in 10 early second-half minutes, with a Jonny Hayes goal sandwiched in between, to claim victory encounter at New Douglas Park. Hamilton had taken a deserved lead on 29 minutes when Dougie Imrie produced an excellent finish against his old team, but the bottom side had no answer to Inverness's swift and comprehensive second-half response, which leaves Accies still searching for their first home victory of the season. Dundee United came back from a goal behind to draw 1-1 with Kilmarnock in an entertaining contest at Tannadice. The visitors opened the scoring after 22 minutes when Conor Sammon latched on to a clever pass from Mehdi Taouil and smashed the ball low past Dusan Pernis in the United goal. However, Peter Houston's side got back on level terms within a minute when Johnny Russell prodded the ball past Cameron Bell for his second goal for the club. The second half failed to produce as much goalmouth action as the opening period, but some of Killie's passing was a joy to watch, with the on-loan midfielder Alexei Eremenko at the heart of most that was good for the away team.Nial Briggs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
