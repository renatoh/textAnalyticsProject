His father is profoundly deaf. 'I can understand a little of the sign language my father does for me, but not much. I can understand a little of what he says to me, but he doesn't speak much,' he says. 'Being deaf makes him grumpy. And he works hard. He doesn't play with me. Not much.' Edward, who has just turned eight, is also not expecting to persuade his mother to allow him to paint at home throughout the summer. 'She's very tidy. She says I might make a mess.' A talented artist, Edward was the youngest person to win a place in a national watercolour show; he was six at the time. He also sold all his works within half an hour, before any other artist sold one. He is encouraged by his 77-year-old [paternal] grandfather, who 'can also draw a perfect circle' and who will buy a \u00a316 tube of white paint, see Edward squeeze it out all at once, and not complain. Edward spends weekends at his grandparents' in Knaresborough during term times, and likes to stay there longer during the summer. 'Outside in Granddad's shed we sit at a desk. I have a chair and he has a chair.' Besides painting, Edward enjoys spending time with their four sheepdogs, one of whom, Meg, they refer to as his dog. Frequently, he says: 'Grandpa, can we take the dogs for a walk again yet?' Until this happens he also arranges his collection of badges, by categories, on boards ('I don't wear them'), reads the Beano and Transformer comics, and dresses up. 'Sometimes as a wizard, sometimes in grandma's skirts.' His grandfather also encourages Edward's interest in identifying every car's name ('Another Punto, Granddad!'). But Edward has concerns about his grandfather being at the steering wheel. 'The scariest thing, if we go to the beach this summer, would be Grandpa's driving, because he always crashes into things,' he says. 'He also takes silly turns. It was windy on the motorway and overtaking a lorry our BMW hit a mud bank, went through a stone wall and into some pine trees.' 'I'm trying to slow down, Edward,' says his grandfather, 'but when I slow down and drive like other people things sometimes go wrong.' 'Can we take the dogs for a walk now?' Their walks involve Edward reversing his grandfather's mobility scooter out of the front shed and then sitting between his grandfather's legs as they take turns steering it around the housing estate, the four dogs either leading the way or trailing behind. 'Meg is the fastest,' says Edward. 'Granddad once caught Fly's tail - she's the oldest - in the scooter wheel. Part of it was ripped off. And I was wearing Grandma's red cape.' 'It could have been an \"Isadora Duncan\",' says his grandmother. She is keen to see that there's no repeat of the incident in which, as granddad says, 'We shot off on it in full lock.' 'We hit a kerb and it fell over on to Granddad's leg,' says Edward. 'I'll drive, Granddad!' The girl solidier Forget tidying your room. It's bug-outs and smoke bombs on Charlotte Hopson's radar 'Most girls around where I live aren't doing much this summer except walking around looking girly and wanting to be popular, but being boring,' says Charlotte Hopson, who has just turned 15 and wears leopard-skin blouse and white jeans soiled by a foundation sponge she sat on. 'I mean, I like looking nice too, but worrying about messy hair isn't going to stop me doing anything.' Most of Charlotte's neighbourhood friends are male. 'Boys are more fun, not scared to have mud fights, or injure themselves. Someone will be sprayed with deodorant on the way home and have their hood set fire to. We buy doughnuts at Tesco's and end up throwing them at people. We'll all get trolleys and ram people in the malls. Being idiots, really.' But such boisterous times on the streets and in the parks of Clifton Moor in York are only a part of Charlotte's summer. Because she is also a member of the Army Cadet Force, very recently moving up a rank to Lance Corporal. She's just spent two weeks in an ACF training camp in Scotland and later in the month goes to Oosterbeek in Holland for a week - 'to walk', says her mother, who does not wish her to join the army. 'It's called marching, mother,' says Charlotte. 'The ACF is all well and good, but I'm dead against you signing up for the army,' her mum says. 'My friend's ex-husband was a squaddie and the tales he tells about bullying, you wouldn't believe. So over my dead body. I'll fight you all the way.' Charlotte's mother thought the ACF, which Charlotte joined when she was 12, might make her more likely to clean her bedroom. What Charlotte got was a 'disciplined' environment in which to partake of adrenaline rushes. 'Where else can you get to fire guns, basically?' she asks. 'One day in Scotland we got an L98A1 Cadet GP rifle and 1,500 rounds and just had fun with them really. I love shooting.' Charlotte rates it 'a good holiday', cheap too ('only \u00a345 for a fortnight, meals included'). She has to be up at 6am to 'bug out' (run away) from pink and green smoke bombs, to spend nights in a basher (a poncho) on 'Exs' (expeditions), to run over obstacle courses and attack houses, to drill, even to spend time cleaning floors. 'When I get back from marching in Oosterbeek, I'll sleep into the afternoon,' she ponders, 'then I've got one-and-a-half days to finish my school art project and see my boyfriend Lofty, who'll [mo]ped over.' Her art project, already half done, is her version of a Calvin Klein ad in which a male model is tugging on a female model's hair. Her mother has told her it looks like Charlotte and the 17-year-old Lofty. 'Lofty says he just mopes around when I'm gone, missing me - but he's messing.' The chess prodigy Darius Parvizi-Wayne wants tennis camp, board time and 'no boring walks with mum and dad' Chess prodigy Darius Parvizi-Wayne is playing a lot of organised sports this summer, in day camps and during at least two luxury family holidays abroad (including La Manga resort in southern Spain). At tennis camp he has already been 'very upset' over coming only second. But his parents are keen that the Hampstead public schoolboy doesn't spend too much time on the chequered board. 'We don't want a chess grandmaster in the family,' says his mother, an Iranian-born market analyst. Darius, eight, took to 'thrashing' his Polish nanny at chess at the age of three-and-a-half and recently came fourth in the gigafinal of the UK Chess Challenge 2007 (which began with 74,000 competitors). But by playing less chess with pros during the summer, Darius fears a slowdown in his development - or worse, he'll go in reverse if his parents don't arrange for him to do more competitions, or see his chess teacher sooner. Games of chess against his mother are over in under 10 minutes. 'Mummy's opening is bad, but the main problem with mummy is she never spots my traps,' he says. Darius enjoys playing computer games with his 10-year-old sister Sophia on one of the two screens - placed next to each other - on a table in his parents' bedroom, but he gets annoyed that Sophia takes up more space with her mouse. Often their Penguin avatars 'meet' in the 'lobby' of the subscription games site Club Penguin, to sled race against each other. Darius likes amassing 'coins' (points) from dexterous Penguin surfing, Penguin pizza-making and being a Penguin secret agent, as well as saving banknotes and (found) coins in the wall safe he received as a Persian New Year present. His mother is trying to restrict his screen time to half an hour a day this summer, but says he 'goes for it' when she's not looking. 'I'm definitely an opportunist,' he admits. The family travels abroad frequently, but after a couple of days Darius usually asks when they're going home. 'I don't like going on their boring walks,' he explains, 'but I do like being in good hotels.' His favourite is The Crown Plaza in Marlow, where they'll be staying during the weekends his gynaecologist father is on call at the local hospital. It is Darius's second home. 'For breakfast I normally have fruit, an English breakfast, then yogurt with sugar and then a little pain au chocolat.' When friends visit, Darius plays snooker with them on the table in his bedroom and cricket in the communal garden. But his biggest aim during the summer break is to beat his athletic sister in a run on Parliament Hill. 'No chance,' says Sophia. 'It is a tough challenge,' says Darius, 'But it is certainly not impossible.' The pop star Mollie Kingsley, 15, is taking her band on tour to promote their critically acclaimed album Since the beginning of August, Poppy and the Jezebels have played three gigs in London - in Clapham, Camden and on the main stage of the Underage Festival in Victoria Park, Hackney, following the release of their debut 'mini-album' Follow Me Down, which music journalists judge 'devastatingly cool' and setting 'an impressive standard for a new generation'. Other gigs, outside the capital, will be followed by a show at Bull Hall in Shepherd's Bush, by which time possibly everyone will have heard of Poppy and the Jezebels, and its members - aged 15 and 16 - will all be back in school. Mollie Kingsley, the band's singer, who turned 15 at the start of summer, is concerned that everyone is harping on constantly and rather patronisingly about their ages, although she admits that the matter affects the way they function and the day-to-day possibilities during summer. 'If we're in an underage band we want to have underage people be able to come and see us. The other week we wanted to go to a reggae show at the Rainbow in Moseley and when we asked on the phone, \"Is it over 18?\" someone very curt said, \"Of course it's over 18!\" and put the phone down.' At the same time they were receiving emails asking them to perform at the Rainbow. 'They can fuck off, can't they?' says Mollie. All of the band live in Birmingham's King's Heath (where they attend the same school) and they are rehearsing and developing new songs at the elegantly crumbling studio of Bob Lamb (one-time member of the Steve Gibbons Band and producer of UB40). Mollie, 'the missing part of the chemistry', joined the band to first sing 'Walk On the Wild Side', after fireworks night in Cannon Hill Park. Well before their first single, 'Nazi Girls', they developed a MySpace page, which they regard as an important element in their success. Apart from keyboard player Dom (who was 'anxious' at the time) they consider the last two summers their best so far - taking in experiments with cider, cigarettes, sneaking out of homes and staying up through the night. They could have filled the entire summer with performances, but are confident there are enough summers to go for this one not to be a thorough baptism of fire. Mollie found time for a week in Greece with her mother early in August and will shortly be heading to Wales for a few days with her boyfriend. 'Summer is about being able to laze around all day if you want to, not having to worry about things,' she says, as parents and step-parents arrive to whisk the band away. 'The liberation of no school. But, oh God, there's two GCSE art projects and a prose essay and an English essay to do. And a geography project about Stratford-upon-Avon - the most tiresome, boring thing you could ever think of.' The band are delighted to see that teenagers are invigorated by their summer shows, but Mollie wishes to remind Londoners that the supposed trend towards underage gigs has barely taken off nationwide. 'There's a big fuss in the press about it, but from our experience and what we know, there's nowhere to go in Birmingham of a night, ever. And,' she adds, 'a lot of bands are singing about how they went to the chip shop and got punched in the face and they're really pissed off; but we're like, \"Hold on, we're going to sing about UFOs.\" Because music should be about something better than the world we live in.' The actor Piers Stubbs, 13, is quitting The Sound of Music for TV, radio and a dream trip to Anfield A month ago Piers Stubbs and his mother were vaguely imagining that they might have a brief holiday this summer. It's proved impossible, as usual. Piers is at Sylvia Young Theatre School and frequently gets acting jobs, in and outside term-time. 'I'm working throughout the summer - all the way,' says Piers. 'It's so much fun. It's what keeps my summers alive.' This summer, having done theatre almost consistently for two years, Piers has stepped out of The Sound of Music in the West End and is concentrating on TV work, radio plays, language CDs, adverts and the second series of Little Einsteins, with any spare weekday spent dropping into summer school at Sylvia Young. 'I've done so many jobs that it's good to catch up on some acting, singing and dancing lessons. The advantage to summer is not having homework to catch up on, too.' Most of the time Piers doesn't know what extra booking or audition he's doing one day to the next, being whisked off by a chauffeur-chaperone (usually Bob, the father of one of McFly). Piers arrives for all jobs and auditions wearing his Sylvia Young uniform. 'I have to. I'm in a lot of trouble otherwise.' In five summers since moving to London he's never just pottered and played around like most children, although he'll sometimes take himself off to buy clothes in Topman on Oxford Street, where he gets a discount and where once a visiting Lindsay Lohan attempted to kiss him for being so cute. He eats at restaurants with his mother, who is his best friend and confidante but a self-proclaimed hopeless cook. 'I am so terrible in the kitchen, aren't I Piers?' she screeches excitedly. In his bedroom, one wall of which is a large mirror, he dances to R&amp;B, or - if a fellow pupil visits from the Sylvia Young school - he plays table football, or Fifa video games in which he always chooses Liverpool as his side. Beyond work, Liverpool seems to be his one abiding passion. 'I've supported them for nine years, although I've only see them play once, at Crystal Palace.' This summer he is keeping up on all Liverpool's news via his mobile phone, and watching matches whenever possible on the plasma screen in the lounge precisely feng-shued by his mother. 'What I'd really like is to be driven up to Anfield,' says Piers. 'It's not likely, but I am working on it.' The drummer Rhiana Taylor, 11, will be the youngest ever steel pan player at the Notting Hill Carnival 'I really don't remember all the summers I've had but I don't remember not enjoying any,' says Rhiana Taylor. 'Summer to me means holiday with no school, although I miss my friends and the music lessons. Summer means bike stuff and shops. Summer is swimming, jumping off diving boards. One summer I went to Jamaica and almost drowned in the sea. Last summer I was staying at grandma's in Leyton and going to parties with her. Summer usually means dancing to hip hop, bashment and Elephant Man. My cousin tells me about the latest dances and dance hall queens. But this summer for me means a lot of pan.' Rhiana, 11, raised as a Rastafarian, has a Jamaican-born father and Mauritian-born mother and lives in a three-bedroomed house in Wood Green, with two older sisters and four older brothers, the elder two flashing extensive dreadlocks as they tend to their cars outside. Assorted sisters, brothers and cousins keep an eye on Rhiana at different times. The house is a hive of music, musical instruments and musical styles. A sister plays a violin while a brother plays a clarinet. Records play. Someone sings 'I love the summer, I love the summer'. A piano tinkles with jazz. A cousin and friends arrive outside who MC to reggae under the name MI5. Rhiana, who earlier sat listening to Aaliyah, now beats steel. Rhiana's first instrument was the cello. She still plays it, but is spending a lot of time now playing with two- or four-beaters on a pan drum, a skill developed rapidly and which this year will see her taking part in performance and competition at the Notting Hill Carnival, at an age younger than has been seen on the pans before. Her hope this summer is that as part of a group of pan players she will take first place in a Carnival competition called Panorama. Until the hush-hush tune she'll be playing was decided upon, Rhiana began practising daily both on 'Amazing Grace' and 'Get Busy', the latter, by Sean Paul, being her preference. One of her sisters says she cannot understand how easily Rhiana, with Trinidadian 'tenor and double tenor' sounds, interpreted Sean Paul's paean to getting jiggy. 'I can sense myself getting better every day,' says Rhiana. The skateboarder Paul-Luc Ronchetti will be showing off his rodeos and kickflips from Newquay to California At home in Wymondham, in Norfolk, the bedroom of Paul-Luc Ronchetti appears at first sight typical of 14-year-old boys. Posters are on the walls, clothes piled seemingly randomly on the floor, and scores of stickers decorate his bed-frame. Most of these items, however, have been received from his sponsors, or relate to competitions and venues worldwide where he's made a name as the UK's top 'vert' skateboarder, projecting himself down 18ft-high 'half-pipe' ramps to undertake 540s, frontside rodeos, gay twists, 360 kickflips - and other tricks which an older generation of skateboarders probably took years to pull off. 'School is just where I go to work hard in order to earn time to skate,' says Paul-Luc. 'There's a lot going on this summer, so it's good school isn't getting in the way.' Last week, after a very brief, rained-out camping and skateboarding holiday in Cornwall, he headed to California - his third trip to America this year - for the highpoint of his career so far, competing against the world's top skateboarders in The X-Games. He's returning to appear at this weekend's Rip Curl Boardmasters skate, surf and music festival in Newquay, before doing more spectacular demos at the Creamfields festival in Daresbury and preparing to win - 'hopefully' - the third and final leg of the UK Vert Championships in Birmingham. When he's at home, Paul-Luc visits his small local skate park at the recreation ground in Wymondham, but he rates it just a one-out-of-10. So, for the past two years he's relied on his mother driving him on 300-mile round trips to the nearest skate park with a full vert ramp, in Birmingham. 'I can't say I thought I'd spend my life hanging around in grungey old skate parks on cold wet days with their roofs leaking,' she notes, 'and I can't think of Paul-Luc becoming a professional skateboarder as a really good career move. But he'll be sitting tied down to a desk from the point he leaves school until the day he's 65, so he should have as much fun as possible really. I doubt it's something he'll be able to do at 40, 50.' 'Sean Gough is still up there and he's 42,' insists Paul-Luc. 'But Sean Gough has horrific scars on his body,' frowns his mother. 'And Dave Allen's broken practically every bone in his body.' If, during the school summer break, there surface any spare moments in between travelling and undertaking treacherous tricks - fuelled by pasta and the Brazilian berry energy drink Acai - Paul-Luc will rehearse on the drum kit in the spare bedroom with his 'occasional' band, Freeback. Or he'll play Tony Hawk skateboard video games ('I'm not very good at them'). Or communicate by email with older American skateboarders who advise him on attitude. Or watch recordings of himself on the Extreme Sports channel doing 540 radials. Or even briefly visit Thorpe Park, where his father (living in Fleet during weekdays) is general manager. Surprisingly, though, Paul-Luc says he hates the park's thrill rides. Although he likes getting friends into Thorpe Park free and visiting the control room, he considers the likes of Stealth, Colossus and Nemesis Inferno - top summer magnets for many of his age - 'far too scary' to even venture on to. The rapper 12-year-old Muazzin Aziz will be training his vocal chords to mimic the sound of a siren For Muazzin Aziz - winner of 'The Rise Slam 2007 Rhythmic Award' - a summer off school means less opportunity to daily and spontaneously engage in rapping and beat-boxing with two classmates; their proximity during term-time and the atmosphere and audience of the schoolyard being almost ideal. The very first rap lyrics Muazzin conceived, at age eight, were about arriving at school ('Thinking on the subject of fresh rhymes/ Memorising my rap lines/ Beat-boxing for showtime/ Lyrics and beats ready to combine...'). The downside is having to report to the headmaster's office when crowds scream their appreciation for Muazzin's percussive noises and lyrical dexterity. In the summer, the best venue for these skills is the local park in Bethnal Green, although his uncle - his guardian - has been discouraging his visits there since he was 'set upon' by a group of over 20 youths. Many rappers rap about 'beating up, shank (stabbing) and other violence', but Muazzin dismisses this as too typical. When at home - a small house of many Bangladeshi sisters and cousins - much of Muazzin's summer is spent downloading from Torrent and listening to a wide range of music (Slint, Mumbles, Klashnekoff, Bjork, Rage Against The Machine, MIA, Immortal Technique), studying beat-boxers on YouTube ('This is Faith SFX doing a clickroll to the theme of The Godfather') and creating tracks on a program called Reason, to send to schoolfriends. They give names like 'the twizzler' to their percussive sounds and debate the stylistic ups and downs of older London rappers ('Wiley flows, Dizzy Rascal is not rapping sense'). Above Muazzin's computer is a portrait of his deceased mother; to the right a bedroom window which 'everyone get to see down into' from the 50 balconies facing it. His uncle says the feeling of being looked upon is more uncomfortable out on the streets; that the 'war on terror' has resulted in them being judged on their hue and that the gathering emotional effects are little considered. 'I don't think we'll be going away for a holiday,' says Muazzin. 'But because I won at the Rise Festival the Poetry Society are recording me rapping \"Focus Your Mind\". I hope it isn't as rubbish as the mix they did of me last year. I'm also getting studio time with Killer Killer, the beat-boxer. The group Subtext are doing a rap workshop and on Mondays I'm on open mic at Rich Mix on Bethnal Green Road.' At Rich Mix, friends and admirers, many of them female, scream their approval. 'I'll just keep striving to create better and more original beats and rhymes with a better flow,' he says of Summer. He hopes to reach the sound of sirens with his vocal chords. Then he'll play around with the form to make the siren sound his own. The emigrant Kieron Mears, eight, is moving to Spain with his family. He's worried about toy prices Kieron Mears sits on the settee in what, for a few more days, is his home in Beck Row in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, squinting at the sunshine through half-opened curtains. Around the house are boxes packed and shortly to be driven to sunnier climes, his parents having decided, on a holiday in Spain, to emigrate there. This summer, for Kieron, is all about moving to a different house in a different country, with a different language, different friends and a different school. And he's in two minds about it all. 'I don't normally like it hot,' he says. It's a sentiment not shared by his father, who says he's had enough of the cold weather and working all day, in the cane furniture dispatch business, then 'coming home and leaving the car running outside for my wife to drive straight off to work evenings in Burger King'. For the price of their Beck Row house they're heading for a furnished property with equal bedrooms but the addition of a roof terrace, solarium and a small communal pool. Plus \u00a335,000 spare to tide them over until they find jobs, although some of it's going on a hot tub. 'I think the pool is nice,' says Kieron. Meanwhile, all money made on the sale of toys he placed in a box marked 'Car Boot Sale' will be Kieron's on discovery of the nearest Toys 'R' Us to El Galan. Nevertheless, toys are 'one thing that's more expensive in Spain', so Kieron's taking scores of Star Wars toys and Lego cars. And he will again see his two best friends at the leaving party this week. 'They didn't believe me on the last day of school, but I kept on telling them. The head gave me a leaving bear.' It is also unpacked. 'Moving to Spain feels pretty weird but it might be fun meeting new people,' he says. 'The Spanish girls will be all over you,' exclaims his father, whose own parents say they won't be attending the leaving party. Kieron's other grandmother sits on the settee opposite him, saying little. Kieron announces he'll miss a tree in a field nearby which, from one angle, 'looks like the head of a bulldog'. He thinks Spanish parks and playgrounds are 'full of dust, all dusty'. His father loves the way Spaniards sit in squares with their offspring. 'Order two beers in Spanish,' he says to Kieron. 'Dos Coca-Cola por favor.' 'Can you remember what mushroom is?' 'Mudden?' says Kieron. 'I think that's tomato. They're huge there. We'll listen to Spanish in Three Months in the van driving down there.' 'I know bad words. Mummy has big titties. What is titties? ... But do you promise we'll get an Xbox 360 when we get there?' 'Yes. But we won't be indoors much anymore. From now on summer's going on all year round.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
