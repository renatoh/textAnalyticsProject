As Philip Hammond prepares to deliver his first full budget next week, McDonnell told the Guardian he hoped more transparency about individuals\u2019 tax affairs would cut down on tax avoidance and encourage a more open civic culture. He said that Labour had been inspired by the practice in some Nordic countries, including Norway and Sweden, where the publication of tax records is common. \u201cThere is a big issue now about, people don\u2019t have trust in the establishment \u2013 they don\u2019t think they\u2019re listening to them, don\u2019t think they\u2019re paying their way or being fair. So one way of re-establishing some element of openness and transparency would be, why not \u2013 over a million, you publish your tax return. Why not?\u201d He added: \u201cI think openness and transparency is the basis of confidence and trust. And what we\u2019ve got in society is a lack of trust, in people who make decisions and people of the establishment. And I think we\u2019ve got to start rebuilding trust in our society. And on the tax evasion, tax avoidance, it would help on that, certainly.\u201d He believes tackling tax avoidance is a necessary first step towards funding public services more generously. \u201cThe first thing is making sure that tax avoidance and tax evasion are tackled properly; and the second issue is making sure that you invest rather than give it away. At the moment we\u2019re getting the worst of all worlds \u2013 they don\u2019t collect it; they don\u2019t tackle it; and at the same time what they do collect, they give away.\u201d Some senior politicians, including former prime minister David Cameron, published limited details of their tax affairs after the Panama Papers scandal last year, when the Guardian revealed details of investments in offshore trusts. McDonnell said Labour would not legislate for all politicians to reveal the details of their tax affairs but stressed that he had made his own tax return public. \u201cI have a responsibility, if I want to look after the tax affairs of the country.\u201d Several cabinet members, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and health secretary Jeremy Hunt, are millionaires, but few are likely to earn as much as \u00a31m annually, although George Osborne, the Tatton MP and former chancellor, made more than \u00a3500,000 from speeches in the United States last autumn alone. The new rule would be based on taxpayers\u2019 income, not their wealth \u2013 so homeowners whose property is worth more than \u00a31m would not be affected. Much less than 1% of British households earn more than \u00a31m in income each year. McDonnell\u2019s policy chimes with a project by Finance Uncovered, a not-for-profit network of investigative journalists, many in developing countries, who have written to more than 7,000 politicians in 20 countries, including Britain, urging them to publish details of their tax affairs. Finance Uncovered\u2019s Nick Mathiason said: \u201cThere is, in our view, a clear and substantial public interest in elected representatives fully disclosing their sources of income and their tax payments. Elected representatives are paid by taxpayers to make decisions on taxation and on how our money is spent on behalf of all of us.\u201d McDonnell, a longtime champion of tax transparency, will announce his new approach in a pre-budget speech on Thursday. \u201cThis issue around tax evasion and avoidance, we are coming back on the stump on that,\u201d he said. Labour will make better funding for the NHS and social care its central demand for next week\u2019s budget. McDonnell said Hammond had created some room for manoeuvre by loosening his tax-and-spending rules in the autumn statement, and should spend it on the struggling health system. Asked how much extra funding the NHS and social care systems should be given, McDonnell said: \u201cWhat they need; what they need.\u201d \u201cIf you can do that, I think what you\u2019ll find is that it will stabilise the system \u2013 but it\u2019s got to be consistently funded,\u201d he said. McDonnell is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest political ally, and the tax transparency policy is part of an attempt to show that the Labour leadership is pressing ahead with drawing up radical policies, despite the embarrassing setback of the Copeland byelection, when Labour lost a seat it had held since the 1930s. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that Labour has \u201cno prospect\u201d of winning the 2020 general election unless it changes course, and suggested Corbyn\u2019s leadership was partly to blame for the party\u2019s poor performance in the Cumbrian seat. Corbyn has already floated the idea of tackling excessive pay by using government procurement projects to encourage companies to narrow the ratio between their lowest and highest-paid workers. Asked about whether the transparency policy would raise concerns about privacy, McDonnell pointed to the system in Sweden and Norway, where the government maintains a database of tax details, from which anyone can request information. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on with a situation where people don\u2019t have confidence in the taxation system. Like the Panama Papers \u2013 we can\u2019t have a situation, with overseas dependencies and things like that, that goes on like this. Not when people are being treated on trolleys in hospitals,\u201d he said. Alex Cobham, director of the Tax Justice Network, welcomed Labour\u2019s commitment to greater transparency, but suggested the priority should be politicians, rather than highlypaid individuals in private life. He said: \u201cI would say maybe it\u2019s politicians rather than just the most wealthy we should be interested in. Ultimately we need to be more concerned about potential conflicts of interest, and trust HMRC is doing its job properly for everyone else.\u201d How much tax do British millionaires pay? There are 16,000 people in Britain who earn more than \u00a31m a year, according to the latest full-year figures from HMRC. Of this figure, about 5,000 earn more than \u00a32m a year. They earn a combined \u00a339.8bn and are expected to pay almost 40% in tax to the exchequer, but the exact amount isn\u2019t disclosed. In recent years, as increases in the personal threshold each year have taken more low earners out of paying income tax, they have made up a larger slice of the government\u2019s income. Combined with all the 300,000 additional rate taxpayers \u2013 those earning more than \u00a3150,000 \u2013 they contribute about \u00a346bn, equivalent to \u00a3150,000 each. As government ministers were keen to point out last year when figures became available, the amount this larger group pay each year has risen from 2% of the nation\u2019s tax bill in 1997 to 27.3%. But the publicly available information about the better off is limited. Even the leading authorities on tax and spending in the UK, such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation, complain that HMRC has failed to provide statistics for millionaires\u2019 incomes except in aggregate. It means that government claims of receiving higher tax payments from the super-rich despite scrapping the 50p tax rate remain a subject of dispute. Little is known about the welfare payments they receive in the form of tax reliefs on pensions and other legitimate methods of reducing the tax they pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
