Death Disco's booker apparently got a bit carried away this month, so the \"too many acts, not enough decks\" conundrum was solved by hiring another club to accommodate the spill over. A fleet of \"Disco Buses\" will be operating between The Arches and SWG3, with bespoke mixtapes soundtracking the short journey. The headlining DJs bestow a Nordic vibe upon proceedings, with midnight sun minimalist Lindstr\u00f8m joining his old chum Prins Thomas deckside. Live acts include post-punk trio Factory Floor, whose sparse instrumental electronica recalls a certain early-80s, Factory Records-era bleakness, happily counterbalanced by Retro/Grade, recent darlings of the summer festival circuit and purveyors of camped-up, Italo disco. The Arches, Argyle Street &amp; SWG3, Eastvale Place, Sat Patric Baird Alpha-ville 2011, London Running alongside the London Design Festival, the Alpha-ville International Festival Of Post-Digital Culture returns for a third year. The event includes a series of \"exchanges\" with academics and tech boffins to help enlighten you on what \"post-digital culture\" actually is, but if you just want to rave, albeit in a determinedly cerebral way, the music programme begins in earnest on Friday at XOYO, with a show featuring the lush electronica of German minimal techno don Pantha Du Prince and Jon Hopkins, plus rising UK beatmakers Illum Sphere, Max Cooper and Andy Stott. Various venues, Thu to 25 Sep Sam Richards Four Tet/Ben UFO, Leeds &amp; London Expect the 300 capacity of Leeds's Wire club to be reached on Wednesday. Maybe that's just as well, because Kieran Hebden's tastes can be pretty eclectic. Though the music of Hebden, AKA Four Tet, is sure to excite, entertain and even educate, the set provided by this remixer may not flow in the same way as those of other DJs. No such worries for fellow guest Ben UFO, a DJ by trade and also one of the chaps behind Hessle Audio. Both are restricted to playing vinyl here, though no such limitations apply on Friday when the pair also appear at Fabric alongside Hessle crew members and Caribou, who also provide a DJ set. Wire, Call Lane, Leeds, Wed; Fabric, EC1, Fri Marc Rowlands Just Jack Presents \u2026 Alex Arnout, Southampton Back in their native Bristol, Just Jack's house and techno-flavoured events span everything in scale from up-close'n'sweaty at the Dojo Lounge to vast multimedia spectaculars at the Motion Skate Park. For the club's first visit to Southampton tonight, they've opted for the former option with a keenly anticipated one-off at the tight but handsomely equipped Junk Club. South coast homeboy Luca Pilato nabs a spot on the lineup after mightily impressing at a JJ session in Bristol in June and he's followed by Just Jack's co-founder Tom Rio, who has played at pretty much all their events since the year dot. Headliner tonight is slow burner Alex Arnout whose attractive, melodic style has made him a London regular for the past decade. In the second room there's a quartet of jocks to steer proceedings in a house-wards direction comprising K1R3Y, LTD!, Deejay Philly and Ryan B. Junk, London Road, Sat John Mitchell The Soundtrack Set, London There's a trend at the moment for DJs to provide live soundtracks to old movies. Last month we had the Innervisions crew noodling along to The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari at Roundhouse; this week, accompaniment to a rooftop screening of Ron Fricke's dreamy 1992 documentary Baraka is provided by Optimo's JD Twitch, whose eclectic sets cover everything from tropic\u00e1lia to bruising minimal techno. The fun will continue indoors, with Cosmic Boogie and Dicky Trisco taking to the decks. Queen Of Hoxton, EC2, Fri Sam Richards"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
