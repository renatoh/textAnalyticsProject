Kenyon, currently in China along with the mayor of London Ken Livingstone as part of the delegation to promote relations between Beijing and London before the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, said talk of a bust-up between the pair is pure \"fabrication\". But while announcing Chelsea have offered China's football team the use of the club's training facilities at Cobham in the lead up to the 2008 Games in Beijing, Kenyon took time out to nail rumours about his relationship with Mourinho. Speculation has been rife that the pair no longer speak and have clashed over the choice of transfer targets for next season. But Kenyon stressed: \"I am 100% happy with him. It is just fabrication.\" The Chelsea chief also boasted that the club was now as big as Manchester United in China. \"We have been looking at research in China which shows we are as popular as Manchester United, whereas two years ago we were not even on the same radar scope. I think the importance of having a successful team is critical to all this and we are going in the right direction on that front,\" he told BBC Radio London. Didier Drogba has urged Mourinho to play him alongside Hernan Crespo more often after the pair both scored in the 4-1 victory against West Ham on Sunday, the first time they have started a match together. The two have spent this season competing for a single place in the team, spending only short spells in a handful of matches on the pitch at the same time. Drogba has made 25 starts and Crespo 22 in all competitions, but the players believe that they are capable of combining well together even if it would mean an end for Mourinho's favoured 4-3-3 formation. \"It was good to start with Hernan,\" Drogba said. \"I think we played very well together. It depends on the boss but I think we want more. Against West Ham I think we played better because we tried to pass and pass and pass and that's the best way. I gave everything I had. I gave everything for the team.\" Mourinho, however, remains unconvinced, with the partnership unlikely to start Saturday's trip to Bolton. \"For me it would be easy to say yes,\" he said. \"But I have to say that they played together for 60 minutes against Fulham - and no goals - and they played together for 30 minutes against Birmingham - and no goals. So I would like to say every formation is good, every tactic is good when the players on the pitch have the ability and the conditions to make it work. \"But it was was a good performance against West Ham and, yes, and I am especially pleased with Crespo because his work defensively was very, very important. He was very, very intelligent the way he closed players in midfield when the team was playing with 10 men and I am very happy with the way they played. It was one of the best performances we have had for the last couple of months and Drogba was fantastic.\" Chelsea's players are due to return to training today after a brief break. Mourinho spent it in Portugal and many of his players also took the opportunity to fly away on holiday. \"It's good because we have big matches in front, big emotions,\" he said. \"We have the emotion of playing the FA Cup semi-final and the emotion of playing for every single point to get nearer the title.\" The only problem Chelsea have is their terrible disciplinary record, with the midfielder Maniche facing a three-match ban after being sent off against West Ham. But Mourinho appears more concerned by the standard of refereeing than that of his side's tackling. \"This season it's so easy to show a red card to a Chelsea player,\" he said. \"You get a red card because of an aggressive tackle, you get a red card because you celebrate a goal, you get a red card for this and for that. It's very easy.\" Bayern Munich's general manager Uli Hoeness has claimed that the only reason for Michael Ballack to join Chelsea this summer would be money. The 29-year-old Germany captain is likely to move to Stamford Bridge when he becomes a free agent in June, with Hoeness admitting that he expects the player to move to Chelsea, adding: \"It would be ridiculous if we tried to challenge someone like [Chelsea's billionaire owner] Mr Abramovich.\" \"It was always clear that Michael did not want to learn a new language or a new culture but a new currency,\" Hoeness said. \"It was obviously only about money. I have absolutely no animosity towards Michael. We will grant him a nice farewell. But he should have been honest and said: 'I am leaving because I want to earn more money.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
