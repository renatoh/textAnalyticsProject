It was 6 December \u2013 189 days ago, to be precise \u2013 when the numbers came out in Salvador and Greg Dyke, sitting directly to Roy Hodgson\u2019s left, was caught miming that little throat-slitting gesture in front of the television cameras. Everyone knew what he meant and, whatever the rights and wrongs of doing it so publicly, there is no point pretending others were not thinking precisely the same. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Morten Olsen, the Denmark coach, said after the March friendly at Wembley. \u201cYou will need it.\u201d He was right, too. Every successful team needs a touch of fortune, as Croatia can probably testify after what happened against Brazil on the opening night in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cAre we going to be lucky?\u201d Steven Gerrard asked. \u201cWill the small details and the referee decisions go our way? Who has that bit of luck?\u201d These are the questions all the teams will be wondering before their first games and, as Gerrard said, it is impossible to know. \u201cAll we can do is control what we can and be prepared as well as possible.\u201d England\u2019s captain says he has never been involved in a tournament when the preparations have been so meticulous. More than anything, England will need football intelligence. Hodgson has put together a team of structure and resilience and all those other English traits and, yes, sometimes there is a temptation to wish he would let off the handbrake a little. Yet there also has to be an element of common sense and when it comes to the popular wish \u2013 for England, with their heavy Liverpool influence, to play with the same commitment to attack as the team from Anfield \u2013 it is worth pointing out that Gerrard does not subscribe to that theory. \u201cPeople talk about: \u2018Is Roy brave or negative?\u2019 I think he has picked a very bold and brave squad. He has a plan and it is not negative. It is not to sit back and camp out on the edge of our box and let\u2019s see what happens. \u201cBut we have to be clever and cute. One of Roy\u2019s main strengths is having a team that is set up and well organised and that will never change. Then it is the players\u2019 responsibility when to get the transition right, when to attack and go for the jugular and when to stick together when times are tough. \u201cThese conditions are going to be tough for both sides, so there is going to be a time when we need to stick together. People talk about playing \u2018the Liverpool way\u2019, but to go to Manaus and play the Liverpool way \u2026 that may not be possible. We have to be cute, clever and experienced. Yes, we can attack and show tempo and pace, try to hunt them down and win the ball, but there will be times when it will be tough on the legs and tough on the lungs, and we are going to have to get the shout out to be close, narrow and hard to beat. That is just common sense.\u201d A balance has to be struck and, for now, that looks like meaning Raheem Sterling being kept back, despite the clamour for him to start. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to give youth a chance, but youth will have to prove to me that it\u2019s better than experience,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIf someone wants to take Gerrard\u2019s position on the field, for example, that\u2019s fine by me. Just as long as that someone proves to me he\u2019s better than Steven Gerrard. I won\u2019t go for youth just because there is a clamour for youth.\u201d If Sterling misses out, Danny Welbeck and Adam Lallana will both be under pressure to justify their places as the teenager has been so electric in training. Equally, Hodgson is entitled to feel he is not short of big performers. The Maracan\u00e3 stood to acclaim Wayne Rooney when his face flashed up on the giant screen before England\u2019s friendly in Rio de Janeiro last June. \u201cIf I play well,\u201d Rooney said earlier in the week, \u201cI know the team will play well.\u201d What a chance this is as well for Daniel Sturridge to prove himself at the highest level. \u201cIf he is good enough to do it for Liverpool in the Premier League, there is absolutely nothing to stop him from doing it on a stage such as the World Cup,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThink back to 1958 and Pel\u00e9 bursting on to the scene as a 17-year-old. He wasn\u2019t even well-known in Brazil, let alone Europe. A month later, he was a superstar.\u201d Sturridge certainly has the gifts to trouble an Italy side that have not won an international since last September and, in fairness to Hodgson, he has taken England out of that joyless phase when Gary Lineker looked on and talked of football from the \u201cdark ages,\u201d with two rigid banks of four and the occasional tendency to knock it over the top. The new England are almost always set up in the more fluid and modern 4-2-3-1 system and, finally, it seems to have clicked that keeping the ball is a lot less tiring than chasing to win it back. The problem is that Italy cottoned on to that a while back. Hodgson is growing weary of being reminded that England had only 25% possession in their Euro 2012 quarter-final \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a great lover of those statistics\u201d \u2013 but he knows there has to be a significant improvement. \u201cThey had a lot of the ball [in 2012] but it was very different circumstances to now. With the energy and pace and mobility we have, I don\u2019t fear that it will be anything like the game in Kiev. That was two years ago, it\u2019s history, we hope we have learned things from it, but I\u2019m much more interested in the videos we\u2019ve put together of Italy playing over the last year, than a game that took place two years ago.\u201d In the dressing room at the Arena Amaz\u00f4nia, Hodgson does not intend to say too much. He has never been a manager who believes in long, rousing team-talks. \u201cNo, I\u2019m a great believer that you should do your work before the dressing room, out on the training field or in the team meetings,\u201d he explained. Gerrard, however, intends to get the attention of his players and tell them \u201clet\u2019s not have any regrets\u201d and, being around the England captain over the last few weeks, it has quickly become apparent it was a mistake to believe Liverpool\u2019s galling end to the season might have adversely affected him in Brazil. The healing process, by Gerrard\u2019s own admission, was not easy bearing in mind his infamous slip against Chelsea, but he says he has shaken it out of his system, and he sounds like he means it. \u201cI had a choice. Initially, of course, it drove me mad for a few nights, a few weeks even. It was a big moment and it went against me but it would have driven me even crazier if it was a mistake when I had lost a man at a corner or not prepared properly. If I made a genuine error that was my fault I would have struggled to recover from it, but everyone in the world has slipped. Whether it is on a football pitch, a kerb or a wet floor, it is one of those things you cannot control. It is a freak incident that happens. I have moved on. I am in a great place mentally, physically, I feel strong and I believe I can go and perform. \u201cMy form over the whole season got stronger and stronger and has been up there with some of the best football I have ever played. What happened against Chelsea was a setback but when you play at the top you are under pressure every single game. Every time I go out to train I am under pressure. I am going to make a big mistake from time to time. I am human, I am normal. I haven\u2019t been too hard on myself and I would rather be in the position to be shot down than underneath, out of the way.\u201d Hodgson would later acclaim Gerrard as the best captain he has encountered in 50 years in the sport and he will need the Liverpool player to be at his absolute best if Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi are not going to dominate the midfield. Rooney has talked about how Italian defenders can find it difficult when the tempo is high but the weather in Manaus makes a slower game more likely. \u201cThe other thing we know is that the opening game at a World Cup are always quite nervy affairs,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cYou build up for a long period of time for this. First you go through a difficult period of qualification, then you\u2019ve got five or six months of planning and dreams and hopes. It\u2019s not always easy to get on to the field in the first game and hit the ground running with your very best football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
