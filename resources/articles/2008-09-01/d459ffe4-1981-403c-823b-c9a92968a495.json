Half an hour later, by which time Stauffenberg had made an excuse to leave the conference, the bomb went off. Three officers and a stenographer were mortally wounded, but - probably because the briefcase had been moved - Hitler himself escaped with minor injuries. Within 12 hours, Stauffenberg had been shot dead. Hitler took his escape as a \"divine moment in history\" and issued a special medal to those with him at the time of the blast. The July 20 plot is now the subject of a Hollywood movie, Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise. Even before its release, however, the film has set off debate within Germany. Will it help the world to understand that, even at the height of the war, not all Germans worshipped the Fuhrer - or further obscure the subtle reality of resistance?
