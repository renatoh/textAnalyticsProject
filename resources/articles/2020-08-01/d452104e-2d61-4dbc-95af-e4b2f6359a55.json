The vessel, named Louise Michel after a French feminist anarchist, set off in secrecy on 18 August from the Spanish seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, and is now in the central Mediterranean, where, on Thursday, it rescued 89 people including 14 women and four children. On Friday, the crew of European activists responded to a mayday call by Moonbird, an aircraft that monitors migrants\u2019 boat in danger in the central Mediterranean, which had spotted a dinghy that was not moving and was taking in water. \u201cLouise Michel proceeded at full speed,\u201d a ship spokesperson said. \u201cWe handed out life vests to 130 people to secure the situation.\u201d The rubber dinghy is currently located in the Maltese search and rescue zone, dangerously overcrowded and taking in water, with a dead body onboard and several others suffering from fuel burns and injuries, after having spent several days at sea. The passengers had previously contacted the Alarm Phone, an emergency hotline assisting refugees at sea, and requested immediate rescue. Both activists of Alarm Phone and Moonbird alerted European authorities to the boat in distress. The crew alleged that neither the Maltese and Italian authorities reacted adequately. The Louise Michel is currently safeguarding the 130 passengers as the ship is already carrying 89 migrants and can accommodate a maximum of 120 passengers on board. The activists stated that the people had been left alone in a European search and rescue zone and warned: \u201cDon\u2019t let it become a body count. Do your job. Rescue them.\u201d Lea Reisner, head of operations for the Louise Michel, said: \u201cThe people have sat in a mix of salt water and fuel for days. It is night and European states are not doing their fucking job. They deny responsibility while we are trying to keep everyone alive \u2026 we need immediate assistance.\u201d Neeske Beckmann of the Moonbird said: \u201cWe were shocked when we saw the rubber boat \u2013 it was incredibly overcrowded and people onboard were trying to shuffle water out of the boat with their bare hands. \u201cWe knew this was a grave emergency situation and decided to send out a mayday relay to all authorities and actors in the vicinity. Responsible European authorities failed to react to our distress call and only the Louise Michel responded to this serious distress case.\u201d Painted in bright pink and featuring Banksy artwork depicting a girl in a life vest holding a heart-shaped safety buoy, the Louise Michel sails under a German flag. The 31-metre motor yacht, formerly owned by French customs authorities, is smaller but considerably faster than other NGO rescue vessels. Claire Faggianelli, an activist who prepared the Louise Michel for its first mission, saw the project as a wake-up call for Europe. \u201cWe really want to try to awaken the consciousness of Europe and say: \u2018Look, we have been yelling at you for years now. There is something that shouldn\u2019t be happening at the very borders of Europe, and you close your eyes to it. Wake up!\u2019\u201d she said. So far in 2020, more than 500 refugees and migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean sea, and the real number is estimated to be considerably higher. On Wednesday, 45 people \u2013 including five children \u2013 died when the engine on their boat exploded off Libya, in the country\u2019s deadliest shipwreck this year, the UN said. More than 19,500 migrants have survived the Mediterranean crossing along the central maritime route this year and reached Italy or Malta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
