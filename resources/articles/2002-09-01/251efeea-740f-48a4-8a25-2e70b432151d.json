Sure, you've never been better qualified, but then you've never had a bigger overdraft either, and the pressure's probably on to start paying it off. But before it starts to get you down, remember that postgrads have never been in greater demand - it's just a case of talking to the right people. And don't be afraid to consider a wider range of options. A survey conducted by the National Postgraduate Committee published last week revealed that 21% of students doing postgrad courses changed their career plans by the half way stage. In many cases, that means deciding against going into teaching, and into the wider commercial world instead. And the good news is that the commercial world is actively recruiting people like you. In the summer, the Association of Graduate Recruiters produced figures which show that 31% of employers target postgraduates, and a further 8% intend to in the future. So how do you get some of this action? While there are careers advisers queuing up to help undergraduates, the postgrad sector has been largely neglected. For example, graduate-publishing outfit Prospects doesn't have a specific postgrad division but Claire MacLean, its postgraduate business unit head, argues that most of the information and advice aimed at undergraduates is equally relevant to those with postgraduate qualifications. There are a number of interactive features on Prospect's website (prospects.ac.uk) that enable job- seeking postgraduates to seek specific help. \"Postgrads can email a careers adviser for help, talk to other postgraduates online, have their CV checked or log on to one of the many regional services designed to help graduates and postgraduates,\" says Claire. \"They can also visit their local careers services for advice and guidance,\" she says. It's worth remembering that postgraduates are welcome (and positively encouraged by many employers) to apply for graduate training schemes. While it might seem like something of a comedown to take a job that you could have landed with your degree, you're probably much more employable as a result of your second course, and likely to be up against others with similar levels of experience. One employer which actively courts postgrads to its graduate training programme is Kodak. \"Postgrad students often have that little bit extra that we are looking for,\" says a spokesperson in the Kodak human resources department. \"We are after a combination of technical skills and genuine leadership abilities. Our ideal recruits usually have two or three years more experience of life, many will have spent time in a supervisory capacity and some will have some of the so-called softer skills that will also make them attractive.\" While Kodak only takes six graduates/postgraduates a year, the same principles apply across many industry sectors. In particular, there will always be a big demand for postgrads with a science background from companies looking to plug gaps in their research and development divisions. There is also anecdotal evidence that postgraduates who join graduate programmes tend to shoot up the corporate ladder quicker than their first-degree counterparts. If you are still unsure of the best outlet for your talents, there's a recruitment consultancy you might want to talk to. Despite its name, PhDjobs.com specialises in placing people with any postgraduate qualification, not just those with PhDs. \"We set it up in 1998 after realising that postgraduates were falling between the cracks,\" explains Martin Gallagher, one of PhDjobs.com's founders, \"and as far as I know we are the only consultants who only recruit postgraduates.\" Martin says that postgraduates are in demand in a variety of sectors and that many will be unaware of just how rewarding their skills could be. \"The classic example is theoretical physicists who are in great demand with derivative trading departments at investment banks for their modelling skills. \"Derivative trading is highly complex and relies on staff who can build models which will predict what prices will do in the future. It might seem an unlikely career path for a physicist but it's a match that can work very well.\" Martin also says there is similar demand for economists, computer scientists and mathematicians - in fact, anyone with modelling abilities. The other area in which there is huge demand for postgraduates at the moment is in the field of biosciences. \"As the telecom sector has declined over the past 18 months, this has emerged to take its place,\" says Martin, \"and I would estimate that around 40% of our positions are currently in this area. That said, we've got lots of employers in several different sectors looking for postgraduates with a variety of experience.\" He suggests that those who have more general qualifications such as a PhD in the creative arts, can still move into desirable jobs in unrelated areas. \"It's a case of accentuating your transferable skills. You'll be able to work to your own initiative, prepare detailed research, uncover new ideas, justify an argument, be tenacious - all skills that are hugely in demand by employers,\" he says. One thing to note about PhDjobs.com is that it also operates abroad and has placed several clients into firms in Europe and a number in the United States. Martin says he is happy to talk to any postgraduate looking for career advice, but that those looking for that service should register first at the company's website. If you are still feeling a little bit downbeat, consider one last thought. The Higher Education Statistics Agency suggests that the postgraduate unemployment rate is just 2.4% - just over half that for first degree graduates. The stats are on your side, and your course won't have been in vain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
