Sure canned vegetables often have a softer texture and might take a bit of spicing, baking or pureeing to make them shine, but these processes often result in ideal comfort food. Beetroot Lurid, sweet and mercifully pre-peeled, tinned beets are highly nutritious and can be easily substituted for their fresh counterparts without much sacrifice of flavour. Beyond blitzing them into smoothies or a classic bortsch, they\u2019re also a great source of richness and moisture, as in Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s beetroot, caraway and goat\u2019s cheese bread which \u201chas a cakey texture, and is best eaten spread with lots of salted butter\u201d. Or you can turn them into a very treaty brunch by making Eve O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s chocolate and beetroot pancakes. She promises they are \u201ca doddle to make\u201d. Chickpeas Much like beetroot, chickpeas can be a secret weapon in sweet dishes such as a \u201cdelicious, fudgy\u201d chocolate and chickpea torte with rum cream by Justine Pattison. You can even save the aquafaba (the viscous liquid in the tin) for Felicity Cloake\u2019s vegan chocolate mousse. For something a bit more trad, whip up an easy to make at home hummus, or a fancier version with Ottolenghi\u2019s hummus recipes. If you feel like something hearty and warming, Anna Jones\u2019 quick chickpea and turmeric stew (pictured above), which is brightened with whole lemons, should hit the spot. Butter beans While tinned butter beans\u2019 softer texture doesn\u2019t always stand up to hours of braising, it does make them a great addition to salads, such as Jones\u2019 Greek-inspired warm salad with tomatoes and olives. They also crisp up well in a skillet, as in this one-pot dinner with kale, parmesan and lemon (pictured). It also makes them perfect for whipping with cream cheese for a more-ish dip; or turning into a \u201cherby, garlicy\u201d mash. Canned fish Moving on from the obvious tuna nicoise or tuna melt toastie (though Kelis\u2019 version does hit the spot), preserved fish can pack a huge amount of flavour. Yes, that makes it divisive, but if you\u2019re a fan of intensity, Jack Monroe\u2019s smoked mackerel fishcakes deliver, and she writes, you can swap the mackerel for sardines to make the dish more affordable. Jane Baxter\u2019s Sicilian sardine pasta ups the oceanic taste even further with slices of anchovy, then offsets it with some sweetness from sultanas. If you\u2019d rather have something less fishy, try Ottolenghi\u2019s harissa-spiced tuna picnic cake for a taste of alfresco dining at home. Corn Canned corn has a less-than-stellar reputation, but there few Australian pantries without a tin of it lurking somewhere. If you\u2019re missing cafe brunches, Meera Sodha\u2019s American-style barbecue beans and corn fritters (pictured) should ease the ache. For dinner, Nigel Slater\u2019s smoked haddock and sweetcorn puree is chowder-adjacent and works well with the tinned stuff. But let\u2019s be real. The reason we keep corn is to bake breakfast muffins \u2013 like these bacon muffins made extra corny by using a combination of flour and polenta. Coconut milk Not so much second fiddle to the fresh stuff as a pantry essential, cooking with coconut milk can give bring a bit of tropical joy into your house. Use it as a milk replacement in porridge or blend it into a smoothie. But for something seasonal and more ambitious, try Annabel Crabb\u2019s Sri Lankan butternut and cashew curry recipe. She says \u201cthis modest recreation of a sambol is pretty to look at and is the perfect foil for a rich, spicy butternut and cashew curry\u201d. For something sweet, Ottolenghi\u2019s coconut pudding with brazil nuts and lime syrup (pictured) is an exercise in contrasts: the pudding is similar \u201cto panna cotta or set yoghurt. The flavours are very delicate, and the smooth texture works beautifully with the crisp coconut and nuts.\u201d Tinned tomato Where would we be without this pantry staple? Assuming everyone has their favourite passata or all\u2019arrabiata and are familiar with canned tomatoes in chicken cacciatore, bring it to breakfast instead with Josh Katz\u2019s recipe for shakshuka \u2013 which includes dollops of tahini for extra earthiness. Or go retro with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s bread and tomato gratin. He says it\u2019s \u201ca wonderful way to turn some stale bread and a couple of tins of tomatoes into a warming supper\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
