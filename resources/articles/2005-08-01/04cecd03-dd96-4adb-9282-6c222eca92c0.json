Ankle problems did for Bellamy and Thatcher while Davies cited a shin complaint. Giggs withdrew earlier with the chest infection which has forced him to miss both of this season's Manchester United games, opening the door for John Hartson to captain his country for the first time. They had already lost Lewis Price, Mark Delaney, Jason Koumas and James Collins. John Toshack has called up Oxford's striker Craig Davis from the Under-21s. It will be the first time Wales have played a full international in the city for 17 years. \"Swansea now have a stadium to be proud of,\" said the 30-year-old Hartson. \"I'm Swansea-born but I had not seen it until training this week. It does look a very special stadium.\" Scotland have omitted players from Manchester United, Everton and Dundee United due to their clubs' European commitments so the manager Walter Smith will hand chances to fringe players in tonight's friendly with Austria in Graz. The game is Scotland's only warm-up fixture before the World Cup double header with Italy and Norway next month, and Christian Dailly will captain them in the absence of the Ibrox midfielder Barry Ferguson. Hibernian's 22-year-old forward Derek Riordan will also make his debut while his club- mate Garry O'Connor, four caps already, will feature. \"They may not be paired together but they will certainly get a game at some stage,\" Smith said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
