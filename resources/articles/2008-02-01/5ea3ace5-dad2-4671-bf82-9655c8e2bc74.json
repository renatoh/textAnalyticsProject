The US justice department announced a separate case in which a defence department official and two others were arrested on espionage charges for allegedly passing classified US government documents to China. Officials said Dongfan \"Greg\" Chung, 72, of California, who was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until its defence and space unit was bought by Boeing in 1996, was arrested at his home. He was accused of espionage involving economic secrets, conspiracy and other charges. Chung, a naturalised US citizen, held a secret security clearance when working at Rockwell and Boeing on the space shuttle programme, officials said. He retired in 2002, but the next year he returned to Boeing as a contractor until September 2006. Chung allegedly took and concealed Boeing secrets on the space shuttle, the C17 military transport aircraft and the Delta IV rocket. A Boeing spokesman said the company has been cooperating with the government. The other case involved Gregg William Bergersen, a defence department official, and Tai Shen Kuo and Yu Xin Kang, both of New Orleans. Working under an individual identified in court documents as \"PRC Official A,\" Kuo allegedly cultivated friendships with Bergersen and others in the US government and obtained sensitive data for China. The criminal conduct allegedly took place between January 2006 and February 2008, the court documents said. Kuo, a naturalised US citizen and New Orleans businessman, apparently gathered the information for China. Bergersen is a weapons systems policy analyst at the Arlington-based Defence Security Cooperation Agency in Virginia, which is part of the defence department."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
