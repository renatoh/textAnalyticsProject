Rock, 22, a law student in his final year at Manchester University and with a number of raucous college friends in the 2,000 sell-out crowd, could not resist the temptation to don his all-in-one suit, soon to be banned, to take on the be-shorted Phelps. He finished in 1min 51.46sec, ahead of Phelps in 1.52.86. \"I'm wearing what is legal this year,\" he said afterwards, grinning broadly. This was the penultimate day of international swimming before the polyurethene suits are banned (a contest in St Petersburg finishes tomorrow) and there was a pointed reference from Michael Phelps after he was third in the 200m freestyle to looking forward to the new year when \"it [swimming] is going to be more of a sport than it is\". \"He [Rock] won because he swam a better race than I did,\" the American said. \"But I would rather lose the races now than when they really count in the world championships next summer and the Olympics after that.\" Phelps, who was the only man in both his individual races to wear the shorts that just go down to the knee, yesterday won only in the 4x100m freestyle relay which finished off the meeting with a zing when the Americans broke the world record by 1.68sec. It was a much better day for the European team (Britain, Italy and Germany), but they could not do enough to prevent the US flying back home with a silver trophy, comfortable victors by 185 points to 78. There is not too much shame in that \u2013 this is practically the US Olympic team, and in their three duels with the Americans the Australians, too, have been thrashed. Aside from Rock, there were British victories from Rebecca Adlington in the 800m freestyle, Lizzie Simmonds, who added the 100m backstroke to her win in the 200m backstroke on Friday, Francesca Halsall who added the 50m freestyle to her two victories on Friday, and James Goddard in the 200m individual relay. The two-day meeting was something of a coup for British swimming. Despite the wintry conditions outside, the swimmers threw themselves into the challenge. Eight short-course world records were broken, Phelps swam for the first time in the UK, and, more extraordinarily, was beaten by a Briton. Was he rattled enough to consider training on Christmas Day? \"Well,\" he said, \"maybe I'll go and loosen up a bit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
