The game features the return of super spy Cate Archer, a 60s version of Lara Croft with accessories to make even James Bond jealous. The story picks up a year on from where the original left off, and Archer is again trying to save the world from the nefarious criminal organisation Harm by preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war. Thankfully, the developers have listened to the criticisms of the first game and made sure the sequel improves on almost every aspect. The stealth elements, which never really got into their stride, are now some of the most challenging features. Heightened enemy AI and realistic use of sound, so even disturbing a wind chime can mean a swift and nasty end, mean you are constantly aware of your surroundings. This is one game you have to play with both your eyes and your ears. One of the rarest qualities in gaming is the ability to be genuinely funny, yet No One Lives Forever 2 manages to deliver time after time, with a subtle blend of tongue-in-cheek - if surreal - humour. The days of no-brainer FPSs, which require you to run gung-ho through level after level of repetitive enemies, are over. Gamers need more from their shooters and this one is right on target. (RP) Pro Evolution Soccer 2 PS2 \u00a339.99 Konami **** There's no doubt about it: Pro Evolution Soccer 2 is the best football game around. On the pitch there is nothing that comes close to its intuitive passing and realistic movement. Whether it's clinging to a 1-0 lead, or romping to a 3-0 victory, the Pro Evolution series has always grasped the fundamental fact that scoring is a rare, and treasured, treat that should occur sparingly. While the Fifa series lets you score regular 30-yard overhead kicks, Pro Evo knows that a five yard tap-in after a good move is far more satisfying. Overall, the changes on Pro Evo 2 are subtle. The players now use their strength to hold on to the ball, and don't freeze after being tackled, while the through-ball is even more exquisite. The Master League has been extended with a third division and improved transfer system, and even the commentary has been sorted. But the best way to experience Pro Evolution Soccer is in multiplayer. Playing with a friend on the same side offers some of the most sublime gaming around, as players time their off- the-ball runs. But for a game that requires you to adopt authentic football tactics, it's a shame that so many names are wrong. Because of licensing, you can expect Gigsi instead of Giggs and Aragon instead of Man Utd. You can edit names, but it's time-consuming and a shame, especially as inferior competitors - Fifa and This is Football - have the proper data. This sequel is not a revolution, and the presentational flaws continue to grate, but Pro Evolution Soccer 2 is still the one to beat. (GH) Colin McRae Rally 3 PlayStation 2 Xbox \u00a339.99 Codemasters **** The real Colin McRae has not had the happiest season, but the third incarnation of the game that bears his name is in fine fettle. Despite a bewildering flurry of new rivals this year, it remains the best rallying game. Initially, the graphics and attention to detail grab your attention, but as soon as you get past the preliminaries and down to some serious tail-out action, those become secondary to the feel of the car's handling and its startling impression of behind-the-wheel realism. Colin McRae Rally 3 may cheat - by making the cars easier to handle than real rally cars - but it does not feel as though it does. Version 3 has, perhaps, gained a tiny amount of accessibility - the car setup, for example, has been simplified and has lost some of its fine control - but its most important constituent parts have received attention. The damage model is convincing (although, if you crash in what would be a terminal manner, your car is merely returned to the road), the weather modelling is true to life, and the different surfaces (all of which are represented) demand different approaches. Touches such as the way the plastic tape at the side of stages react to being run over provide an inordinate amount of joy, although not as much as nailing a tricky hairpin just like the professionals. Every boy-racer's dream. (SB)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
