Mike Freelander, a paediatrician and MP for the suburban Sydney seat of Macarthur, had a clear message to the 27 new MPs who will take their seats in parliament\u2019s bear pit for the first time on Monday: \u201cDon\u2019t lose track of your family.\u201d The pointed message comes amid an ongoing discussion about the strains of a federal political career \u2013 the human toll of the often toxic work culture in Parliament House. While the clerk of the house, David Elder, and speaker, Tony Smith, put the MPs through their paces on procedural matters, Freelander spoke to the new members about how to juggle family life with the enormous public demands of a political career. In the short time since he was elected in 2016, Freelander said he had witnessed many relationship breakdowns \u2013 too many \u2013 saying it was a common casualty of an unnatural political life that required many sacrifices. \u201cIn the short time I have been here, I have seen a lot of it, it is a bit disappointing. \u201cIt is an enormous price to pay for everyone \u2013 the spouse, the kids, the MP themselves \u2013 it is an enormous price to pay.\u201d The revolving leadership door of the past decade in Canberra has shone a spotlight on the brutal work culture of Parliament House, which would be intolerable, if not illegal, in most other modern workplaces. In the furnace of leadership turmoil, bullying, backstabbing, white-anting and outright treachery have all become so commonplace that they now barely raise a political eyebrow. At the same time, public cynicism about Australian politics has galvanised as voters witness an ego-driven political culture that has become too frequently obsessed with itself. In the last parliament, the attrition rate among MPs was high. The constitutional wrecking ball of section 44 saw more than a dozen resignations, while the departure of a number of other MPs for \u201cfamily reasons\u201d further fuelled the debate about whether Canberra\u2019s culture was too corrosive for anyone wanting to live a sane and balanced life. Tim Hammond, a rising star of the Labor party from Western Australia, resigned after just two years in the job, saying it had put too much pressure on his young family, while another new Labor MP, Emma Husar, was disendorsed after allegations were levelled against her of bullying and sexual harassment. The harassment charge was found to be without substance. Barnaby Joyce became the poster boy for family dysfunction after it was revealed he and a staffer, Vicki Campion, had engaged in an affair while she worked as his media adviser. Joyce lost his job and his marriage, with the dalliance leading to Malcolm Turnbull introducing a \u201cbonk ban\u201d between MPs and their staff. It was a torrid time. Freelander does not want to say it out loud but agrees the problem of MPs engaging in extramarital affairs is rife. \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t think people set out with the idea, but there are certain attractions to political life. I see it is a bit of an ego thing; you get a lot of attention, it is very positive often, you know what Canberra is like, there are parties every night, there is lots of alcohol being drunk \u2026 there are a lot of temptations, and I think it is sometimes hard to resist those temptations. \u201cThere is lots of fun being a member of parliament but you should never lose track of the fact that your family is back at home doing the stuff that many of us find really painful. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cEveryone\u2019s circumstances are different but it is an ego-driven job, and you can fall into the trap of following your ego rather than following your brain.\u201d Freelander, a father of six and grandfather of six, said he had advised MPs to put aside time for family, saying he was always mindful to block off time that prioritised his wife, children and grand children. \u201cYou have to give your family some time that is sacrosanct and make sure that you don\u2019t get negotiated out of that. You need to set aside time that is your family\u2019s and they should expect that, and not have you break the rules and go off on a trip or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have all signed up to this, but our families didn\u2019t.\u201d Josh Burns, Labor\u2019s new MP for the Victorian seat of Macnamara, conceded it would be difficult to miss time with his young daughter, who was just six weeks old when he first began the process of preselection for the seat. \u201cThe thing I am genuinely worried about is missing out on key milestones, and not being there, and not being at home,\u201d he said. He had heard the message that being an MP was \u201cincredible and amazing\u201d, but also temporary, and not to forget about family at home. \u201cBut I think being a member of this place is something where it should be hard, and it should be exhausting, and it should be draining because it is important work. \u201cTo represent 100,000 people, many of whom need a representative, should be hard and should require a sacrifice because, if it is done properly, it is a worthy thing to do. \u201cBut we are all people, and we all need to make sure that those we care about are the first people we look after, and then everyone else.\u201d Kate Ellis, who juggled her political career while also raising a young family, said she had witnessed an improvement in the past 15 years in federal parliament, with people recognising the challenge of trying to strike the balance between work and family life. \u201cI guess if I had advice it would be take advantage of the fact that there is a much higher level of understanding amongst your colleagues now, that you can ask for help when you need it, that you can ask for leave when you need it. Your colleagues want it to work for you,\u201d she said. \u201cGo in with open eyes, realise there are changes and work out how it is gong to work best for your family and make sure that you and your partner are on the same page.\u201d Ellis, who left parliament at the election to spend more time with her family, said that there had always been warnings about the high rate of relationship breakdowns, but said the debate had \u201cmoved on\u201d. \u201cPeople are actually getting that there are bigger challenges than just keeping your pants on, there are a lot of people who are balancing their families. \u201cGoing from having a normal family life to spending a third to half of your time on the other side of the country places a different pressure on your relationship. Even if everyone is behaving themselves, it is still hard to manage.\u201d Elder, who has been clerk of the house for the past five years, said part of the program for \u201cMP school\u201d was also to remind new members that life in parliament was not all about conflict. \u201cThere are friends to be made on the other side of politics as well as your own side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe place does work in a bipartisan way in many regards behind the scenes and in informal ways like parliamentary friendship groups. \u201cIt is not conflict all the time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
