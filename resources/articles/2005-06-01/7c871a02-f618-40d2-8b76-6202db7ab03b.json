But that did not stop Harbhajan Singh bringing his own touch of devil to the party. In 16 overs Hampshire were reduced from 63-1, and just about surviving against a difficult pace attack, to 146 all out. They finished 66 short of the follow-on. By the time Harbhajan came on in the 19th over Hampshire were holding out on a wicket that looked to be favouring seam, with Jimmy Ormond in particular getting bounce and movement. The Indian spinner, however, playing his third championship match, was given an over before tea to test the wicket. The increase in danger was obvious. Two overs later he bagged John Crawley, a batsman with a reputation for liking spin - the edge flying to Richard Clinton at forward short square leg. His second victim, Craig McMillan, chose to attack rather than defend, dancing down the wicket only to be stumped by Jonathan Batty for 17. Graham Lamb managed to bat-pad to Ormond at short gully and by then the benefit of spin had become so obvious that Ormond himself switched for a few overs of off-spin, but to little effect. Watching from the other end was Chris Benham, making his debut at the Rose Bowl. He must have wondered at the change in a strip which the previous day had granted Warne a measly two wickets from 21 overs. However he had scrabbled his way to 41 before being deceived by the ball that has been under close inspection: Harbhajan's doosra turned away from his bat and into the hands of Ali Brown at slip. Sean Ervine managed an even finer edge to give Batty his third victim before Warne got himself out twice in the same over - once caught in the covers off a no-ball then being bowled to give Harbhajan his sixth victim. Ormond, by now back to medium pace, ended the innings by bowling Billy Taylor, leaving Surrey's stand-in captain Graham Thorpe the chance to sleep on the follow-on decision. Earlier Surrey had hurried along, adding 35 in six overs to their overnight total of 326. Dominic Thornely, the Australian standing in for Azhar Mahmood, had reached 73 when he tried one big hit too many and became Chris Tremlett's 39th scalp of the season. Thornely, who scored more than 1,000 runs with New South Wales in the winter, is due to leave Surrey in the middle of next month but is keen to stay close to Australia's Ashes squad in case of any further emergencies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
