In a speech in to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, Mr Straw dismissed what he calls \"proposals doing the rounds on the continent\", saying they \"simply would not work\". Referring to suggestions that the no-fly zones should be extended over the whole of Iraq and that the inspectors should be assisted by \"blue helmeted\" UN troops, Mr Straw said \"we did examine both of these ideas in the preparations for what became [UN resolution]1441\". \"There was wide appreciation not just between the US and the UK but among partners,\" he added, \"that they were simply not feasible in the absence of complete Iraqi cooperation and not necessary if we had complete Iraqi cooperation\". Mr Straw continued, that \"the fact that those proposals are now being aired is significant for one thing only - they represent the clearest admission yet that Iraq is not cooperating\". \"Nothing in Saddam's performance can give any confidence that any of these proposals would in any way change his behaviour,\" he stated. \"Instead they are a recipe for procrastination, and delay.\" And Mr Straw also criticised the decision by France, Germany and Belgium to block a move to send Nato missile batteries to defend Turkey in the event of a war. He suggested that it represents a breaking of a promise made at last year's Nato summit in Prague to support the implementation UN resolution 1441 and \"ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without conditions or restrictions\". Mr Straw argued that failing to make \"the most basic defensive measures in respect of Turkey\" was \"a serious issue\". \"Inaction in the face of a threat to an ally risks eroding the solemn commitments which underlie the North Atlantic treaty, and undermining the transatlantic defence relationship which served every ally so well during the cold war and the turbulent decade which followed,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
