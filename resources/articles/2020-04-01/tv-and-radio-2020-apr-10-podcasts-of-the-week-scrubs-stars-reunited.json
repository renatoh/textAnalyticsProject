The anecdotes flow freely as Braff describes the moment they became JD and Turk and their bromance began immediately. \u201cEvery time I was playing the wide-eyed guy walking around, I was just being me because I couldn\u2019t believe it was happening,\u201d says Braff. They mirror their characters a lot as they talk about their hatred of the show\u2019s credits, X-ray blunders and more. Hannah Verdier Unlocking Us Oprah-endorsed self-help queen, academic and bestselling author Bren\u00e9 Brown hosts this podcast, essentially an anxiety-quelling Ted talk in audio form. If that sounds worthy, perhaps it\u2019s exactly the boost we need right now; not least in the first episode, where Brown throws out a Mandela quote and implores us to temper our expectations with new experiences (or FFTs, \u201ceffing first times\u201d), especially in the current pandemic (\u201cI\u2019m a grown-ass person, but I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing \u2026 \u201d). Hannah J Davies Producer pick: Here\u2019s the Deal Chosen by Danielle Stephens (audio producer) Former vice president, current democratic nominee for the presidency and now \u2026 podcast host. In a week that saw Biden\u2019s only rival for the democratic nominee suspend his campaign, he sat down (virtually of course) with the Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She is the reason to listen to this week\u2019s episode. Whitmer has simultaneously garnered admiration from the more powerful Democrat players, and drawn ire from a certain Republican in the White House for how she\u2019s dealing with Covid-19 in her state. She talks about having to work, and enjoy working, with Republicans across the aisle to build a consensus \u2013 breath of fresh air for anyone who, like me, who feels bipartisanship has been all but lost in the US. There\u2019s a small monologue by Biden in the middle about how great Americans have been through the coronavirus crisis, but you can skip that and come back in for the listener\u2019s questions at the end. Unfortunately for Joe, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s found his calling in podcasting. But it will certainly be interesting to see who else appears on the show in the run up to the November election.
