The centre-left party finished clear of the centre-right Liberals of outgoing prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, who improved on their 2015 score to reach 23.4%, and the populist, far-right Danish People\u2019s party (DPP), which plunged to 8.7% \u2013 less than half its tally in the last election. Although the Social Democrat-led \u201cred bloc\u201d of leftist parties won 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, against 75 for Rasmussen\u2019s rival \u201cblue bloc\u201d, Mette Frederiksen, the Social Democrat leader, has said she intends to form a minority government with ad hoc support from parties across the spectrum. Forming a coalition could prove difficult as other parties on the left mostly do not back the Social Democrats\u2019 controversial immigration policies. Frederiksen has also rejected a proposal from Rasmussen to enter a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with his Liberals, although the two biggest parties have a majority between them. Rasmussen conceded defeat on Wednesday night, saying he would hand his government\u2019s resignation to Queen Margrethe on Thursday. \u201cAs things stand, Mette Frederiksen has a chance to form a government,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be easy for her.\u201d He said he would be \u201cstanding by the phone\u201d for eventual coalition talks. Frederiksen told a victory party that Denmark had \u201cchosen a new majority, and a new direction \u2026 After tonight, we will put welfare first in Denmark again. Welfare, climate, education, children, future. Think of what we can do together. We now have the hope to change Denmark.\u201d The centre-left party focused its campaign on climate issues and the defence of Denmark\u2019s prized welfare state, promising to reverse years of spending cuts to education and healthcare, and maintain its tough approach on immigration. Long a benchmark for welfare, the Nordic social model has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to ageing populations. In Denmark, reforms have led to economic growth above the EU average, but successive budget cuts have left more people paying for services that used to be free. Finland\u2019s Social Democrats narrowly won elections in April on a promise to raise taxes to increase social spending levels, while Sweden\u2019s centre-left party held on to power last year by pledging welfare reforms. According to a Gallup poll published in February, 57% of Danish voters felt the incoming government should prioritise action on the climate crisis. For those aged between 18 and 35, the figure was 69%. Denmark\u2019s two biggest mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right, which immigrants and human rights campaigners believe have led to a rise in racist abuse and discrimination. Both the Social Democrats and Liberals have argued that stricter immigration policies were needed to protect the welfare system. Frederiksen has refused to accept criticism of her stance on immigration. The Social Democrats have backed many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, most of them at the instigation \u2013 and with the parliamentary support \u2013 of the far-right DPP. These have included a ban on wearing the Islamic burqa and niqab in public, as well as a widely-criticised \u2013 if largely symbolic \u2013 \u201cjewellery bill\u201d that in principle allows police to seize refugees\u2019 valuables to help pay the cost of their treatment by the state. The nationalist, anti-immigration DPP, which has heavily influenced Denmark\u2019s politics over the past two decades by supporting successive centre-right governments in exchange for tighter immigration policies, has lost support as the mainstream parties have increasingly adopted its discourse. But the far-right party has also come under pressure from two new extreme-right parties, one of which, Stram Kurs (Hard Line), has called for Islam to be banned and hundreds of thousands of Muslims to be deported. It failed to reach the 2% threshold for a seat in parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
