Cole, whose hits included This Will Be and Unforgettable, died aged 65 on Thursday night, according to her publicist Maureen O\u2019Connor. Her family said she died at Cedars-Sinai medical centre in Los Angeles due to complications from ongoing health issues. \u201cNatalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived \u2026 with dignity, strength and honour. Our beloved mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain unforgettable in our hearts forever,\u201d read the statement from her son, Robert Yancy, and sisters Timolin and Casey Cole. The singer had battled drug problems and hepatitis for many years. She had a kidney transplant in May 2009. Fellow performers paid tribute on Friday night following the news of her death. Aretha Franklin said: \u201cI am sorry to hear about Natalie Cole\u2019s passing. I had to hold back the tears. I know how hard she fought. She fought for so long. She was one of the greatest singers of our time.\u201d Tony Bennett described her as \u201can exceptional jazz singer\u201d. He said: \u201cIt was an honour to have recorded and performed with her on several occasions. She was a lovely and generous person who will be greatly missed.\u201d Dionne Warwick said she was \u201cmore like family than friend \u2026 My heart aches. My sincere condolences to her family and may she now rest in peace.\u201d The Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted: \u201c#NatalieCole, sister beloved &amp; of substance and sound. May her soul rest in peace. #Inseperable.\u201d The comedian Arsenio Hall said he named his bass guitar after her when he was in college. \u201cAs a young stand up comic I opened for Natalie Cole. She was all that, in all ways! (RIP ).\u201d Cole\u2019s greatest success came with her 1991 album, Unforgettable \u2026 With Love, which paid tribute to her father with reworked versions of some of his best known-songs, including That Sunday That Summer, Too Young and Mona Lisa. Her voice was spliced with her father\u2019s in the title track, offering a delicate duet more than 25 years after his death. The album sold about 14m copies and won six Grammys, including album of the year, and record and song of the year for the title track. While making the album, Cole said she had to \u201cthrow out every R&amp;B lick that I had ever learned and every pop trick I had ever learned. With him, the music was in the background and the voice was in the front.\u201d Cole was also nominated for an Emmy award in 1992 for a televised performance of her father\u2019s songs. \u201cThat was really my thank you,\u201d she said in 2006. \u201cI owed that to him.\u201d Another father-daughter duet, When I Fall in Love, won a Grammy in 1996 for best pop collaboration with vocals, and a follow-up album, Still Unforgettable, won best traditional pop vocal album of 2008. Born in Los Angeles to Nat King Cole, who was already a well-known singer, and former Duke Ellington Orchestra singer Maria Hawkins Ellington, Cole was exposed to some of the greats of US soul music. By the age of six, she sang on her father\u2019s Christmas album and by 11 was performing in her own right. In 2008, she said: \u201cI still love recording and still love the stage, but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.\u201d In her 2000 autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, Cole discussed how she had battled heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol addiction for many years. She spent six months in rehab in 1983. When she announced in 2008 that she had been diagnosed with hepatitis C, a liver disease spread through contact with infected blood, she blamed her past intravenous drug use. Cole received chemotherapy to treat the hepatitis and \u201cwithin four months, I had kidney failure\u201d, she told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 2009. She needed dialysis three times a week until she received a donor kidney on 18 May 2009. Cole toured through much of her illness, often receiving dialysis at hospitals around the world. \u201cI think that I am a walking testimony [that] you can have scars,\u201d she told People magazine. \u201cYou can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
