The authors of the study discussed in it clearly have little understanding of how schools actually work. The study seems to assume the only people in schools are children. A typical secondary school has about 100 teaching staff and about 100 support staff. That\u2019s 200 adults, many of whom will be asthmatic, diabetic or have cancer, or live with people who are in those groups. All these adults \u2013 as well as the children \u2013 can catch and spread coronavirus. The idea of social distancing in classrooms is laughable. Most schools would need to double the classrooms to make this work. The idea of shutting playgrounds is profoundly wrong. Pupils need to have breaks, get outside and run around. If playgrounds are shut, what should a big school do? Stick all the pupils in the gym or assembly hall? How does the two-metre rule work then? Lastly, how are these pupils meant to travel to school? On crammed buses needed by key workers to get to work, driven by bus drivers, who once again will all be put at risk. It\u2019s important that the education community debunks this nonsense. Jeremy Taylor South Norwood, London \u2022 The UCL study on which you report makes a valid point: the clinical impact of the virus on schoolchildren is relatively low. But its authors seem to have forgotten one thing: it isn\u2019t children who run schools. I\u2019m part of our school\u2019s skeleton-staff rota, which exists to ensure key workers\u2019 children can be looked after. As a young, healthy teacher with no dependants, I\u2019m happy to do this, but many of my colleagues aren\u2019t in that boat. Several are high-risk, with existing medical conditions. Some are pregnant. A handful are over 70. I wouldn\u2019t want a single one of them anywhere near the building. So long as the advice to the general population remains that we all stay at home, it would be nonsensical to remove social distancing expectations for school staff only. Especially when so many of them are providing such comprehensive online learning alternatives. And no, nothing can adequately replace face-to-face interactions when it comes to a child\u2019s education, but there are bigger fish to fry right now. Caiti Walter Secondary school teacher Tooting, London \u2022 As an experienced primary school teacher, may I suggest how schools might be reopened? Children usually sit close together in classrooms. There is an increasing emphasis on working together and moving around the teaching area rather than sitting at a desk for more formal teaching. This makes lessons more engaging but increases interpersonal contact. To reduce contact, each class could be divided into two groups. One group would attend every morning and have an early lunch before going home. There would be an interval to allow for cleaning before the afternoon group arrived. The same teacher would teach each small class every session while the split school day was in operation. Other precautions could be implemented, such as ensuring each child uses their own set of equipment rather than sharing crayons etc. The teaching in school would necessarily be quite formal in order to minimise contact. However, children could be given instructions and resources to do creative activities at home, possibly related to the topics covered in school. The teachers might make themselves available online to students and parents for some of the time outside their session.
