Senior Tories were quick to raise fresh concerns over the former foreign secretary\u2019s suitability for No 10 as the favourite to succeed Theresa May stonewalled question after question about the incident at the first hustings of the leadership contest in front of party members. Asked about the story, revealed on Friday evening by the Guardian, Johnson told the Birmingham audience that people did not \u201cwant to hear about that kind of thing\u201d. When pressed on whether understanding his character was important in the battle to replace Theresa May, Johnson insisted he would only talk about his plans \u201cfor the country and our party\u201d. Radio presenter Iain Dale, a former Tory candidate who hosted the hustings, accused Johnson of \u201ccompletely avoiding\u201d questions about the argument with Carrie Symonds, a former Conservative party head of press, at their home in the early hours of Friday morning. \u201cPeople are entitled to ask about me and my determination, my character and what I want to do for the country,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLet me just tell you that when I make a promise in politics, about what I\u2019m going to do, I keep that promise and I deliver.\u201d The police confirmed they were called to the couple\u2019s south London flat after an argument was heard by neighbours. They said they heard slamming and banging, adding that at one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. Foreign office minister Alan Duncan, who worked under Johnson said his former boss now had a \u201cbig question mark over his head\u201d adding that he had shown a \u201clack of discipline\u201d throughout his career. A poll conducted yesterday showed support for Johnson had fallen sharply following the incident. His eight-point lead for the Tory crown earlier in the week had fallen to three points behind rival Jeremy Hunt by yesterday morning. Among Tory voters, when asked who would make the best prime minister, Johnson\u2019s lead had slumped from 27% to 11% in the same period, according to Survation, who carried out the polls for the Mail on Sunday. Last night the neighbour who contacted the police, Tom Penn, 30, a playwright, issued a statement saying he wanted to put the record straight on his reasons for recording the row and calling 999. Penn said he only acted as a last resort and that he was speaking out as he was concerned by the \u201cbizarre and fictitious allegations\u201d made about him and his wife, Eve Leigh, 34, a fellow playwright. Penn said: \u201cIn the early hours of Friday morning, I answered a phone call from a take-away food delivery driver. At the same time, I heard what sounded like shouting coming from the street. I went downstairs, on the phone to the driver, and collected my food. On the way back into my flat, it became clear that the shouting was coming from a neighbour\u2019s flat. It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone. \u201cAfter a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed we should check on our neighbours. I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response. I went back upstairs into my flat, and we agreed that we should call the police.\u201d Another neighbour, a nursery teacher who lives with her husband and four-year-old son in the top flat next door, told the Times that she could hear \u201cshouting and screaming\u201d. Fatimah, 32, said: \u201cIt was really loud, loud enough to make me turn down the TV and see what was going on. I could hear shouting and screaming from a lady, she sounded really angry. There was a man\u2019s voice too, but he was much calmer and he was telling her to calm down but she was still chucking things about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt went on for about 10 minutes. I\u2019ve never heard anything like it. I was considering calling the police but then a [police] van and car came.\u201d The incident has enouraged those backing Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s opponent for PM. With Johnson having positioned himself as the candidate in favour of a hard Brexit, Hunt used the hustings to harden his position on no-deal saying he would \u201c100%\u201d leave the EU at the end of October with no deal if he believed the EU was not willing to compromise. Today Johnson is expected to come under further pressure over his Brexit policy when Liam Fox, the international trade secretary will call into doubt his claim that the UK would be not be hit automatically by tariffs on EU exports in the event of a no-deal outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
