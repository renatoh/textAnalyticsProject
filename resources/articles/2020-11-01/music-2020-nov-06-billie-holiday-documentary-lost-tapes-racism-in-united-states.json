The boys at least could go out in the woods. You don\u2019t know anything about it because you\u2019ve never had to subjugate yourself to it. Never!\u201d James Erskine\u2019s film is constructed entirely from such interviews by Kuehl, a high-school teacher and Holiday fan with a sideline in arts journalism. In 1971, she began plans for a biography: Holiday had died aged 44 in 1959 and, 11 years on, Kuehl wanted to speak to those who were there throughout her life. She interviewed and interviewed and was still finding people in 1978 \u2013 almost 200 of them in all. The project overwhelmed her and she never finished it, and in 1979 she was found dead on a Washington sidewalk. Police deemed it suicide, Kuehl having supposedly jumped from her hotel room, although there was no proof of this. Her interviews found their way to a private collector and were later used in other writers\u2019 biographies of Holiday. More recently, documentary director Erskine bought the rights to Kuehl\u2019s tapes. His film is a journey through Holiday\u2019s life, narrated by the voices on those tapes \u2013 eyewitnesses to one of the 20th century\u2019s most remarkable artists. \u201cThe first tape we put on was Charles Mingus,\u201d Erskine says now of hearing Kuehl\u2019s interviews. \u201cImmediately we were transported back to the 1950s through that deep voice. A way of talking that\u2019s like music itself, an unguardedness, but also a documentary eye. It really felt like you were back there in Chicago in the 50s, with all the greats of jazz there, Ella [Fitzgerald] waiting in the wings as Billie performs. It was intoxicating.\u201d Listening to musicians, lovers, pimps, childhood friends and FBI agents recounting their time with Holiday is an evocative and transportive experience. We hear Kuehl, too, a great interviewer who cut through the gloss. It is a raw, unsanitised character study, in which Holiday is both combative and vulnerable, coy and revolutionary: a fiery, foul-mouthed thrill-seeker who never sacrificed her integrity. This is all the more refreshing considering that Holiday\u2019s estate, acquired in 2012 by music company Concord, came on board as producers. \u201cWhat I love about the film is we\u2019re not changing who she was,\u201d says Michele Smith, who manages the estate. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing her flaws. She\u2019s unapologetically Billie. She only knows how to be her.\u201d The testimonials are riotous. \u201cShe came down one night between shows and said, \u2018Pick me up tonight!\u2019\u201d says John Simmons, who played bass with her, took drugs with her and slept with her. \u201cAnd, as I was walking in the door, she was walking out the door with a chick. But the next night \u2026 she collected me. She would go off with a chick, or something like that; she\u2019d probably make them perform a three-ring circus. After that she\u2019d probably go off and get a prostitute. She was a sex machine.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t shy away from such material, or the lifetime of abuse Holiday suffered. This is vital, says Smith. \u201cA lot of people just think of her addictions but don\u2019t know about her upbringing. You cannot judge her without knowing who she really is. She was born in the United States in 1915 as a poor black girl, growing up to be a woman who has been sexually assaulted, raped at 10 years old, then tried to find a place for herself in this world.\u201d Through Kuehl\u2019s interviews we hear first-hand about Holiday\u2019s awful husbands and boyfriends, a rogues\u2019 gallery of exploiters and abusers, men who would knock her out in the street. Holiday would fight back: \u201cShe hit him over the head with a Coke bottle or something and kinda laid his head open, and they both went to the hospital,\u201d says trombonist Melba Liston of one such episode. But these men squeezed the life out of her, chipping away at her confidence, physically and mentally beating her down. \u201cShe did not make all the best choices,\u201d Smith says. \u201cBut you have to understand why she was a certain way.\u201d As well as her childhood trauma, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t allowed to go to restaurants, to use restrooms, because she wasn\u2019t treated as a full human\u201d. The film documents this racism. She wasn\u2019t allowed to enter venues via the front doors, lest she offend the white clientele who were there to see her; she spent months touring the south with Artie Shaw\u2019s white band, in which she had to hunt down hotels to sleep in, barred from the ones the rest of the band stayed in. \u201cAfter we would eat she always ordered an extra hamburger and she\u2019d put that in her purse, because she never knew when she would not be able to be served,\u201d a friend says in the the film. This was compounded by Holiday\u2019s decision to sing Strange Fruit, the protest song presented to her by writer Abel Meeropol in 1939. In the film, Barney Josephson, the owner of the non-segregated club Caf\u00e9 Society, where she first performed it, details how some white people, \u201cone party after another\u201d, would file out of the place as she did so. Holiday had it written into her contract that she would be singing the song, at every concert, everywhere. The FBI began chasing her \u2013 ostensibly for drug offences \u2013 soon after that. \u201cFrom 1939 to her death in 1959 the government went after her because she was black, she was wealthy and she dared to sing Strange Fruit,\u201d Smith says. Holiday herself said that, in May 1947, she was ordered not to sing it at a concert in Philadelphia. That night, narcotic agents raided her hotel room and, as she returned from the gig, shot at Holiday\u2019s car as she saw them and sped off. She was later arrested and sentenced to a year\u2019s imprisonment. FBI files in 1949 stated that Holiday has been discredited to set an example to others. One of the agents, Colonel George White, told Kuehl that Holiday\u2019s \u201cfancy coats and fancy automobiles and her jewellery and her diamonds\u201d generated much resentment. \u201cThey made her public enemy number one and destroyed her life in a lot of ways,\u201d says Smith. Literally, some would say. Holiday died due to cirrhosis of the liver, caused by alcohol abuse, but, arguably, she was driven to death by two decades of persecution. Even at the end she was arrested in her hospital bed for possession of narcotics. Sadly, it all seems relevant. \u201cWe finished the film last year and I didn\u2019t see it again until September,\u201d says Erskine. \u201cI was shocked at how political it felt. When we were making it, we felt that we were presenting truths about things that everybody understood, the white man\u2019s power, structural racism. I was setting out to make a film about Billie, and one of the joys of it is that you get to really see her. But I guess it tells us that we haven\u2019t really addressed any generational wounds in society.\u201d Mostly though, he says, \u201cif the film feels relevant it\u2019s because she feels relevant. She talks about sex, about race, about violence, issues that are right at the heart of how we communicate today, and she doesn\u2019t talk about them on the back foot. Billie Holiday got up and sang Strange Fruit in 1939, then pretty much every night of her life for 20 years. She was incarcerated for it, and she sang it to white audiences, and this was 16 years before Rosa Parks.\u201d Holiday had no idea of what the long-term effects of singing Strange Fruit would be: imprisoned for a year because of a drug charge; permanently banned from singing in venues that served alcohol, thus wiping out a vast amount of future income and forcing her to tour endlessly until she died. Yet, says Smith, she would not compromise. \u201cShe knew by singing it that she was going to lose a lot. And she did. With the civil rights movement in the 60s people lost their lives, and in essence she lost her life by singing this song.\u201d That, she says, on top of the music, is why Holiday\u2019s legacy has endured. \u201cShe knew her place. And sometimes she didn\u2019t want to stay in her place. That\u2019s why she\u2019s Billie Holiday \u2013 she was a fighter. And, as an icon, she has survived.\u201d Jo Jones summed it up. \u201cHow did she take it?\u201d he replied, when Linda Kuehl asked how Holiday dealt with segregation. \u201cFuck it! She\u2019d go in and sing! Go and fuck \u2019em! She did what she did until she died.\u201d \u2022 Billie is available digitally from 16 November on Amazon and iTunes. A Q&amp;A with James Erskine is on 15 November as part of London Jazz festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
