What had been, at least for the first couple of seasons, the ultimate carefree televisual experience, has recently had the heat turned on it: do the contestants present unrealistic and unattainable body images (at least one study by a mental health charity believes so)? Has the show failed to provide enough diversity (the creative director put his foot in it by implying that doing so might stop contestants fancying each other)? And did the show\u2019s format and any lack of adequate aftercare contribute to the deaths of the former contestants Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis? Suddenly the guilty part of the show\u2019s \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d appeal became rather more concerning. The fact that the first male contestant on the show \u2013 Anton Danyluk \u2013 has been criticised for an unearthed photograph showing him blacked up as Mr T won\u2019t exactly have settled nerves. ITV has announced a series of behind-the-scenes measures to look after this season\u2019s contestants but, from the second the opening credits roll, you wouldn\u2019t know anything had changed. The villa is the same. The format is the same. There is more ethnic diversity, and one self-proclaimed \u201ccurvy\u201d contestant, but they are all still tanned and toned and apparently allergic to any kind of fabric. The girls arrive \u2013 a scientist! A cabin crew member! Someone who believes that surfing can be an entire personality! \u2013 and once the women have lined up by the pool, the lads arrive for their perusal. \u201cI bet you didn\u2019t expect a Scottish accent to be coming out of this?\u201d grins Danyluk as he struts up to be evaluated. Out of what? A human who has been shaved smoother than an eel? His wipe-clean legs actually put most of the ladies off and so he partners up with Amy, the only woman willing to step forward for a bit of \u201cthis\u201d. She is a lucky lady \u2013 Danyluk has only been on the show for 30 minutes and we already know that he has a wandering eye and his mum shaves his bum for him. Next up is Sherif, who does what is known in the industry as a \u201cDr Alex\u201d \u2013 being soundly rejected by all the women in the villa. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he says. He has to impose himself on geordie Amber, who maybe needs to work on her tact: \u201cI don\u2019t actually hate you,\u201d she says as he hovers nervously in her vicinity. Five minutes later and she has ditched him for Callum. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d notes Sherif again, glumly. Surfer Lucie is looking for another surfer to surf with because she really likes surfing. But there are no surfers, so she plumps for scouse firefighter Michael instead. Sadly for Michael, the next person to walk in is Joe, who looks marginally more like a surfer, so she jumps ship. Michael is forced to summon up a phrase to encapsulate his heartbreak: \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he sniffs. Michael ends up left to pair up with Yewande (and while there is no legislating for who fancies who, it doesn\u2019t exactly look great that two black contestants are the ones left on the shelf). The show\u2019s makers are keen to let you know that Irish Yewande is a scientist \u2013 she is shown in the intro clip playing with brightlycoloured test tubes, like all scientists do shortly before ripping off their lab coats to reveal their cleavage. Yewande and Michael don\u2019t seem to fancy each other, but later on they break the ice over biotechnology \u2013 one hell of a pay day if you put any money on that \u2013 and the first seeds of romance seem to be blossoming. The same seems true of Sherif and Anna, who didn\u2019t want to pair up but find a bond in the fact he has followed her on Instagram for a year. (Who said old-fashioned courtship is dead?) Sadly, the same can\u2019t be said for Amber and Callum, whose initial attraction seems to have faltered thanks to the inconvenient fact that they have to actually speak to each other. Amber doesn\u2019t recognise the name of Callum\u2019s Welsh home town, so he tells her it is near Cardiff. Sadly, shehas never heard of that, either. \u201cIt\u2019s a place in Wales,\u201d he explains patiently, probably deciding it is best not to ask whether or not she has heard of that. Later, they discuss their ages. She is 21 and he is 28. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re old then?\u201d she says. This won\u2019t end well, but probably better than for Amy and her shaven Anton, who is already promoting himself as the island\u2019s chief love rat by going after Lucie the surfer girl, despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t surf, or look like he surfs, and so is therefore utterly unattractive to her. The season is but one episode old and Anton is already telling barefaced lies to his partner (\u201cI know people would say this, but I would have picked you anyway,\u201d he tells Amy), while trying to crack on with Lucie under her and Joe\u2019s noses. Drama will ensue \u2013 which suggests Love Island hasn\u2019t dulled its edges in the face of criticism. Viewers should strap themselves in for more of the same. It is, after all, what it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
