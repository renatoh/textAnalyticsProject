Please do not add spoilers from the novel, or from later episodes if you are further on in the series. Last week we left Offred horrified at the removal of Ofglen (Emily) and her abrupt replacement with a new Ofglen. The scenes showing Emily wearing that leather bridle (presumably after the removal of her tongue) are the most brutal of the series so far. All the handmaids have is their eyes when it comes to true expression and Alexis Bledel projects the anguish and desperation of Emily\u2019s plight with such power. She is grief-stricken when the Martha (presumably with whom she\u2019s been having an affair) is dragged from the back of the van they\u2019re in and hoisted by the neck on a crane while she watches helplessly on. \u201cI\u2019ve heard pieces of the story from Rita \u2026\u201d Offred says in voiceover as she tells us about the \u201csomething quick and brutal\u201d employed to silence this enemy of the state: a \u201cgender traitor\u201d who later suffers the ultimate punishment for her physical attraction to women. Offred is now suddenly \u201cawake to the world\u201d and wonders how they all sleepwalk through this appalling new half-life. \u201cIn a gradually heating bathtub, you\u2019d be boiled to death before you knew it,\u201d she muses as her mind casts back again to the time before. She is jogging with Moira, chest beaded with sweat, music pumping in her ears as a woman throws them a disapproving look. This, and the comment of \u201csluts\u201d from the barista, are the first hints of a prevailing shift in attitudes towards women. We don\u2019t get much of a run-up from normal life to women\u2019s bank accounts being frozen, but these flashbacks slowly provide more and more of the picture. As June carries her belongings out of her office building, having been asked to leave with all of the other female employees, that blue tint washes over the screen and an Eye nods to her with the first, \u201cUnder his eye\u201d. This is the seam between the old order and the new. After a visit to see Ofwarren\u2019s new baby, Offred is driven home by Nick who delivers her straight into the hands of the Eyes, come to interrogate her about Ofglen that was. Their methods are, as we\u2019ve come to expect, outright cruelty. Aunt Lydia and the Eye only relent in their electrocution and beatings when Serena bursts in and screams that Offred is pregnant. Of course, we find out later that she isn\u2019t, a pair of white underpants stained with blood clutched in Offred\u2019s hands as she sits alone in her room, ruefully thinking there\u2019ll be no ice-cream for her this month. The flashbacks are far more fulsome this episode and the prolonged section after June\u2019s dismissal, leading up to the violence of the protest, gives us a glimpse of that gradual disenfranchisement of the women. A well-meant \u201cI\u2019ll look after you\u201d from Luke is met with a roaring tirade from Moira who, swigging wine, rails against a government who would treat half the population as inferior. The most chilling part is the rapid escalation from martial law (as a response to apparent terrorist attacks) to an all-out coup by the Gilead administration. They take control of the bank accounts, start changing laws and ship armed enforcers to every street. Suddenly, peaceful protestors are picked off with gunfire and June cowers with Moira in the coffee shop that wouldn\u2019t serve them earlier in the episode. When Nick comes to check on Offred later that night, he is emboldened in the relative safety of her room. \u201cI wish I\u2019d just driven away with you,\u201d he says, his face dangerously close to hers. The episode ends on a suitably sour note. Serena\u2019s softening towards Offred transforms to fury in the instant she hears the handmaid say she isn\u2019t pregnant after all. That switch from fellowship to cruelty is so quick it betrays Serena\u2019s truth: that self-interest comes before everything. Ofglen (Emily) wakes in a white surgical ward to discover a bandage over her crotch. She can still have children, Aunt Lydia tells her, but they have evidently removed her clitoris. To the punchy sound of Waiting for Something to Happen by Jay Reatard, Emily tries to harden her resolve as she takes on board what they have done. At the last beat of the scene, she cracks and screams her fury to the indifferent white walls. Cut to black. At this point in the series, I have to doff my wimple to writer Bruce Miller who has employed such economy in the dialogue it\u2019s like every word comes carefully wrapped and placed in the scene. The most quietly savage episode yet. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Under his eye \u2022 The wives are, again, shot from above at their gathering, all in turquoise when they visit Ofwarren\u2019s baby, Angela. This aerial observance of the women is a reminder that everyone in Gilead is watched. \u2022 Janine\u2019s admission that she and her commander are going to run away with baby Angela (she calls her Charlotte) could be the deranged babblings of \u201cbatshit one-eyed Janine\u201d or the real thing. It\u2019s hard to tell. But Offred thinks she is \u201closing touch\u201d. \u2022 I loved Serena\u2019s \u201cWhat we do together is so terrible \u2026 It\u2019s terribly hard\u201d when she speaks kindly to Offred. She corrects herself, but we know what she means. \u2022 Offred\u2019s defiant, \u201cAnd blessed are those who suffer for the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,\u201d to Aunt Lydia is a shocking moment: her inner rebellions suddenly externalised. She risks everything for this single moment of Fuck You. It\u2019s thrilling. \u2022 That slo-mo version of Blondie\u2019s Heart of Glass, set to plaintive strings, was incredible during the riot scene. Bold music choices so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
