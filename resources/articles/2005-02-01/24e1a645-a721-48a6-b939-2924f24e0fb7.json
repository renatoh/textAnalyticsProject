In a bizarre series of events, I passed out, got into some trouble with Turkish gangsters, was robbed of 140,000,000 old Turkish lire (\u00a356) and had three credit cards swiped, cloned, and maxed. Landing in Amsterdam, I swore solemnly to myself not to do the inevitable. For two reasons: the first being that everything available there is readily available elsewhere, albeit less openly; and second, because I actually wanted to see the city for its beauty and culture. But things didn't quite go to plan. Arriving in Amsterdam at 1am, I checked into the Flying Pig hostel, the first port of call for most travellers, and pushed my way through a crowded downstairs bar filled with a potent smell of hash. As I entered the lift, an American girl staggered through and subsequently collapsed. \"Welcome to Amsterdam\" was all she said. 24 hours later, I too found myself in a similar situation. To ensure that I stay away from - or at least not succumb to - the red lights of Amsterdam, I had surrounded myself with two shockingly responsible girls from California and a handful of schoolteachers from Britain. On Valentine's evening we had a commiserative singles dinner in a rather posh but inexpensive Dutch restaurant in the centre of town. I couldn't understand why so many teachers had chosen to visit Amsterdam for their holidays - my initial reaction being that they were fed up with trying to discipline unruly children in London and had chosen the Netherlands as a place where they can chill out during the school half-term. And chill out we did: five of us went off to check out some of Amsterdam's coolest coffee shops. But my request for a \"normal cappuccino\" seemed to have been misunderstood at the Cashmere Lounge coffee shop in the south of the city. It was 36 hours before I found myself rising into a hazy consciousness. I decided that seriously productive tourism was the path forward, and the best way to finish seeing Amsterdam. I bought myself a Museumkaart for \u20ac17 and now have unlimited access for a year to any national museum or gallery in the Netherlands. Even so, off to Turkey I went. I left the airport - passing through more metal detectors than I could count - and made my way to a hostel on Istanbul's modern metro system. The efficiency and cleanliness of the public transportation came as quite a surprise and, staring out of the tram window through the drizzle, I suddenly realised how exciting it was to have finally reached the edge of Europe. But my good mood wasn't to last. It's sad to have to tell this story, but it's occupied most of my time here in Istanbul and caused me more grief than any budget airline. What happened is this. I met a Turkish man who coaxed me into a cunning scam whereby I got invited to a bar that was seemingly picked at random, although obviously prearranged. We had a couple of beers before being joined by a pair of innocuous-looking girls. At this point I realised something odd was going on, so I got up to leave - and was presented with a bill for no less than 349,000,000 lire. Naturally, like every other victim of this scam, I refused to pay. I even demanded they call the police and have me arrested. At this point they got angry, very angry, and their well-rehearsed routine entered another level. I was pushed into a small office surrounded by eight large guys doing their best show off their weapons. I'm then threatened repeatedly, robbed of all my cash and given an hour of verbal abuse while my credit cards are copied. You'd think things couldn't get much worse, but they did - I then had to deal with the police. At first they told me they could get my money back, but only half of it (I'm assuming that the other half was their cut). I refused, and two hours later they reluctantly allowed me make a written statement. They then decided that it would be a good idea to go and confront the proprietors, taking me on this little adventure with them. Swapping their handguns for semi-automatics, they grabbed some bulletproof vests and set out to resolve the problem - with little success. Then at 5am I was driven to Istanbul's main police station, and was sat down in a chief's office next to two men in custody. When one arrestee started shouting, the police in charge took the decision to empty his pockets - from where they pulled a handgun. A little later, the officers left the room and the arrestee attempted make a run for the door! And it was another hour before they brought in the owner of the bar where I was robbed. After this, they throw me in the back of a police car and drive me back to my hostel. It's clear they had no intention of prosecuting him, and had most probably made a deal. It's been pretty much impossible to let go and forget about this awful night. To make a bad situation worse, I found the shop and hotel owners in the vicinity of Sultanahmet (where I was staying) to be among the rudest people I have ever encountered: it took me an hour to find someone who'd allow me to make a simple toll-free call and cancel my cards. Later on, however, I met a guy who did help me restore some of my trust in the city, showing me and two other hostellers around various parts of Istanbul. We visited the sights - in particular the spectacular Blue Mosque - but also learned how to deal with hustlers (simply humour them). We also ate a delicious meal of fried mussels in one of the city's hundreds of rooftop terrace restaurants. What I saw of Istanbul was beautiful - a city where two continents meet and two cultures mingle. Then again, no matter how much time I spent looking around and admiring the vibrant culture, sounds, smells and sights of the place, I found it difficult to escape the fear that someone was trying to scam me. A few days later, I left for Gallipoli with an Australian traveller who's on a pilgrimage to commemorate the campaign during World War I. Flying this week This week I've used a Turkish airline that even the Turks don't seem to have heard of - Corendon. They operate only two routes, from Istanbul to Eindhoven and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Knowing nothing about them, I discovered at Amsterdam Schiphol that they are actually a charter airline and most of their passengers are Dutch and Turkish holidaymakers who've booked package holidays traditionally through travel agents. One down side to flying with a Turkish charter airline is that the cost of the flight works out a little more than I was comfortable paying. Even so, Corendon unquestionably offer the cheapest flights between Western Europe and Turkey, and are only rivalled by the likes of German Wings and Air Berlin. Plus, being served chicken curry on a budget airline was an unexpected and welcome luxury. But beware: the English and Dutch language versions of Corendon's website don't seem to work at the moment, so you have to make bookings by trying your luck at Turkish.
