Oscar Pistorius sat at a press conference table next to his fellow 400m runner LaShawn Merritt who \u2013 just days ago \u2013 had urged the International Association of Athletics Federations to keep a close eye on the issue of prosthetic limbs in able-bodied competition. While the South African double amputee, who looks set to become the first Paralympic athlete to compete at the Olympic Games this summer, defended his position for the umpteenth time since winning his court case against the IAAF in 2008, Merritt squirmed. The American insisted he has the \"utmost respect\" for Pistorius, but in truth the defending Olympic champion has been vehemently outspoken about the Paralympian whom he will be lining up against at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava on Friday night. Merritt, who served a 21\u2011month ban after testing positive for steroids in 2009, had told reporters that he was concerned about the use of technology as a performance-enhancing aid in his sport \u2013 an issue that continues to be debated among sports scientists. \"The prosthetic legs I'm using, the cheetah, have been around since 1996 and I've had the exact same model, same shape since 2004 and nothing's changed on it,\" said Pistorius. \"I'm not looking to increase my times or performances from any application or apparatus, it's all in my training and my recovery, my diet and sacrifices I make on and off the track that make my performances better. So the exact same leg I use now is the one I used before and there are very strict rules to implement [any changes] and anyway, I'm not looking to obtain any advantages through it.\" Asked if he ever worried that fellow athletes may have some reservations over his inclusion at able-bodied competitions, Pistorius seemed oblivious to Merritt's recent comments, insisting that he has the respect of his peers. \"I have a lot of respect for the guys I'm running against and I have a good relationship with them, some of the guys have come to my house in South Africa for off-season training. \"Part of the testing was a good thing because I think there would have been questions that were asked [by athletes], but by me doing the tests any athletes who were worried before we did the tests, most of the critics were put to rest after that. That's probably one of the biggest things for me if my competitors were to have had a problem with me \u2013 but after we'd done the tests I guess it was comforting for myself and it was comforting for them as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
