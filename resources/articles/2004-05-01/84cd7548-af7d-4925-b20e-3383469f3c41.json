Will his runs ever catch up with overs? Is there the slightest chance that he might even get his nose in front? Will he break sweat? Until tiredness forced him into a spurt later on against the second new ball, it was nip and tuck at Lord's yesterday as he evoked a tradition of New Zealand stonewallers going back from Matthew Horne, who made an excruciating century on this ground five years ago, to Trevor Franklin, John Parker and the early Glenn Turner. This was batting directed by Ingmar Bergman to a Leonard Cohen soundtrack. A blockumentary. Not quite up there with the absolute masters of the art - Geoff Boycott was back in the commentary box to analyse this one - but getting there. Already on this tour Richardson had spent 3 hours over 48 against Worcestershire and more than five for his 92 against Kent last week. Yet having seen him haul himself so far up the mountain, the entire crowd would not have begrudged Richardson a century and his name on the honours board in the dressing room. But with the day drawing to a close, and the opener within seven runs of his fourth Test century, he was erroneously sent on his way by Darrell Hair, lbw to a ball from Steve Harmison that clattered into his pads from the inside edge of his bat. All his effort for that: in the circumstances he took his dismissal in good grace and the applause from the crowd was generous and acknowledged in kind. Seven deliveries later, with only 10 balls remaining, play finished for the day as the light closed in. Richardson's 93, spread over six hours and 20 minutes, came from 266 balls with 16 boundaries and an all-run four, all of which means that at least 224 deliveries were met with a dead bat, missed, hit to fielders or flagged by. He had helped New Zealand, who won a good toss, to a position of some strength at 284 for five, his ponderous batting offset by an aggressive 64 from Nathan Astle - 11 fours in that - with whom he added 103 for the second wicket, and a thumping unbeaten 64 at not far off a run a ball from the giant Jacob Oram, their fifth-wicket stand producing 106. Oram, elevated in the batting order (he, Chris Cairns and Brendon McCullum are seen as interchangeable in the late middle order), has hit 10 fours. A good pitch, moderately paced but with decent carry, demanded graft and the England pace bowlers toiled long and hard. They managed to keep a lid on things, with the exception of a wayward first half-hour in which Stephen Fleming, opening for only the second time in a Test, and Richardson got away to a flier, and a calculated assault by Oram on Ashley Giles when the spinner eventually appeared with the second new ball imminent. Harmison, without quite reproducing the menace of the Caribbean, produced some testing overs, especially when he was able to get some swing from the nursery end. He might have had Richardson caught in the gully by Giles when 56 but the fielder, having made a flying effort to his left, could not quite cling on to the chance. Andy Flintoff banging the ball in short of a length is becoming England's control, a role that can deflect his sense of purpose from wicket-taking to parsimony. But to evident delight Flintoff produced one to Astle that moved nicely down the hill and found an edge to give the wicketkeeper Geraint Jones his first catch in Tests on what, with Rodney Marsh watching intently, was a scruffy day behind the stumps. Simon Jones, chosen ahead of James Anderson, also worked up a commendable head of steam from the pavilion end and was rewarded with the wickets of Fleming, well caught in the gully by the debutant Andrew Strauss for 34, and Scott Styris for a duck, Jones taking his second catch. For Matthew Hoggard, however, life has been a struggle this season and he was less impressive at first. In part, though, that had to be because he was asked to take the new ball from the pavilion end despite being an away-swing bowler, while Harmison operated at the other. Convention dictates the opposite. That error was compounded by a fault in his action, in which he steps in towards the line of the stumps in his delivery stride - something exaggerated by the Lord's slope - which causes him to bowl around rather than over his left leg. Obviously England's new-ball tactics had been discussed beforehand, but it was gormless captaincy by Michael Vaughan's deputy Marcus Trescothick not to give Hoggard a chance from the nursery end until after tea. He looked a different bowler at once, finding line, length and away swing, and was rewarded with the wicket of Craig McMillan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
