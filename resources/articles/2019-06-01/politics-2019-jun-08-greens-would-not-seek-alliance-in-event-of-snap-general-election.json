At the start of a spring conference where the Green faithful will celebrate successful local and European elections, as well as national polling putting the party\u2019s support at up to 9%, Jonathan Bartley and Si\u00e2n Berry said it would be up to Labour or the Liberal Democrats to pursue the Greens. Berry, who became co-leader with Bartley last September, taking over from Caroline Lucas, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a very good case in many constituencies for us to be seen as being in the strongest position to beat the Brexit party. \u201cThe other parties would have to come to us, and we wouldn\u2019t be giving anything away in talks. It isn\u2019t our job this time to start anything. We already did that.\u201d Overtures by the Greens to the Lib Dems and Labour before the 2017 election to avoid splitting the anti-Conservative vote through constituency-based pacts came to nothing, and a similar idea for the European elections last month fell foul of what Bartley called \u201cgame playing\u201d. He said of any future deal: \u201cOn any issue where there\u2019s common ground, we\u2019re always willing to have a conversation. But at the same time, it\u2019s going to have to be a very robust conversation. We are offering something very different.\u201d The party has had a successful few months, thanks to a combination of some remain-minded supporters abandoning Labour, greater public awareness of environmental issues following the Extinction Rebellion protests, and the spread of ideas the party has championed, such as a four-day working week and a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d. In the local elections in May, the Greens were the biggest proportional gainers of the national parties, winning 194 new councillors. Later that month, the party beat the Conservatives in the European elections, taking almost 12% of the vote. The co-leaders said the surge was also the result of many years of patient organising at a local level, building up what Bartley called a \u201cnetwork of field organisers\u201d. Berry said: \u201cWhen the local election results came in, every time it was, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve been there, Jonathan\u2019s been there, I recognise those people, I know why they won.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a protest vote, a flash in the pan, a single issue. It was our hard work all year round that\u2019s leading to the results.\u201d The conference this weekend in Scarborough will feature a celebration of recent successes, but also new policy proposals, including a formal endorsement of the global climate strike \u2013 a planned series of protests in September \u2013 spearheaded by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Other initiatives will be new ways to measure the strength of the economy and transport policies based around the \u00a350bn-plus saved by scrapping HS2. Bartley said: \u201cWe think it\u2019s time to pull the plug on the project and put that money into the rail revolution that we need \u2013 cross-country and city links, getting more freight on to rail, electrifying lines, plus new bus routes for rural communities. \u201cAnd to find an alternative to short-haul flights, to get people out of their cars. If we\u2019re going to make this move to a zero-carbon economy, we\u2019re going to have to think very differently about this infrastructure. And we\u2019re the only party putting forward this programme.\u201d While much recent coverage of politics beyond the established parties has focused on the Brexit party \u2013 which is topping Westminster polls, in which the Greens are fifth \u2013 Berry and Bartley said the rise of Nigel Farage\u2019s party presents an opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019re the antidote to the Brexit party,\u201d Bartley said. \u201cWe\u2019re the party that hasn\u2019t compromised. And all the other parties have compromised. \u201cThere\u2019s an issue of trust. A lot of Labour voters came to us in the European elections because they were disappointed in Labour\u2019s position on Brexit, and didn\u2019t trust the Lib Dems because of their record.\u201d If some of these switching voters backed the Greens in the local and European elections, it could become a habit, he argued: \u201cJust going back three months, we knew that this could happen, but we were in a very different position. And this is the nature of politics now, you just do not know what is round the corner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
