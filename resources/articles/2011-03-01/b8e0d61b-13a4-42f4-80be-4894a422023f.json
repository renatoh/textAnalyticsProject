Adams, himself a former White, had called on the ex-Leeds players in his side \u2013 Sam Vokes, Richard Cresswell, Michael Doyle and Shane Lowry were all involved \u2013 to show their opponents what they were missing, but in the end it was a present Leeds player, Eric Lichaj, who set the Blades on the way to victory with his 55th-minute own goal. Bjorn Helge Riise sealed a win that might not have moved United out of the relegation zone but at least gave them some fresh hope. \u2022 QPR won. Nothing unusual there. But Norwich were held by Hull \u2013 Nick Barmby, 37 years young, scored the equaliser \u2013 as were Cardiff, by Millwall, so Rangers' advantage is back up to nine points. Nottingham Forest's hopes of automatic promotion faded further with a 3-2 defeat at Swansea, their winless run now stretching to seven matches. The Swans are only a point behind Norwich after the on-loan Chelsea striker Fabio Borini scored a brace in their 3-2 victory. \u2022 The game of the day in League One came at Walsall, where the Saddlers came from 2-0 down against Hartlepool to win 5-2. Colin Larkin's first goals since September 2009 had put the visitors in control but five different Walsall players scored in the last half hour to give the manager Dean Smith a happy birthday. The win, however, failed to move Walsall out of the bottom four, with relegation rivals Yeovil, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Bristol Rovers all winning as well. \u2022 At the top, Brighton stretched their lead to seven points with a 1-0 victory at Oldham while Huddersfield drew a blank against Swindon. Fourth-placed Southampton kept pace \u2013 they have a game in hand over Peterborough and three over Huddersfield \u2013 but Bournemouth slipped to a third defeat in a row at Carlisle. \u2022 In League Two, Chesterfield got back to winning ways after last week's defeat at Crewe, hammering Rotherham 5-0 on Friday. After fourth-placed Shrewsbury's draw against Wycombe, the Spireites need 11 points from their remaining eight games to be sure of promotion. The only team in the bottom nine to win, Morecambe, did so at the expense of Barnet, who saw Burton edge away from them in 22nd thanks to a point against play-off hopefuls Gillingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
