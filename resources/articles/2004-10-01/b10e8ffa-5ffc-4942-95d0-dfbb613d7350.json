The Chelsea and Romania striker is almost certain to get the minimum six months called for by Fifa, not only because he has taken recreational rather than performance-enhancing drugs, but also because he will plead guilty and agree to rehabilitation and counselling. Mark Bosnich, a former Chelsea goalkeeper, received a nine-month suspension last year and was ordered to pay costs up to \u00a310,000 after pleading guilty to using cocaine. The FA is expected to be less severe with Mutu because of his cooperation. Mutu has admitted to having taken a banned drug last month. Statutes of the World Anti-Doping Agency indicate that offenders should receive two-year suspensions, though Fifa would accept six months. \"It is important to get a fair and objective sentence,\" said Mick McGuire, deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, \"and we do not think two years is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
