Even if you are, you might feel slightly deflated by this subdued nostalgia trip, which returns the label\u2019s key figures (chiefly, members of the Delgados and Mogwai, plus Alex Kapranos, latterly of Franz Ferdinand) to the French town of Mauron, where they played an apparently seminal festival in 1997. \u201cApparently\u201d because there\u2019s virtually no record of the original event. Instead, we get six musicians reminiscing about the 90s glory days before playing a low-key gig in a cafe. The musicians are talented, thoughtful and charming, and their story says plenty about the decline of the music industry. But it feels like we\u2019re getting the comedown without having had the high. They\u2019d have been better off staying in Glasgow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
