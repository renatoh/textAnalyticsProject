Henry returns to the club today having been given extra time off after France reached the World Cup final. Henry's absence brings to five the number of notable Arsenal absentees for that match, which will almost certainly be against Dynamo Zagreb. Freddie Ljungberg, Philippe Senderos and Ga\u00ebl Clichy are injured, and Jens Lehmann is suspended after being sent off in May's European Cup final. Explaining his decision not to risk Henry for the away leg of the qualifying tie, Wenger said: \"He comes back on August 2, so it is very short until August 9.\" It could open the way for Emmanuel Adebayor to make his European debut for Arsenal, having been cup-tied for last season's Champions League. Henry will expect to return for the second leg two weeks later. Manuel Almunia is likely to deputise for Lehmann in goal, Mathieu Flamini is a candidate to play at left-back because Ashley Cole seems certain not to feature even if he is still at the club, and Johan Djourou or Pascal Cygan can be expected to partner Kolo Tour\u00e9 in central defence. Their opponents will be confirmed tonight, with Zagreb taking a 4-1 lead into the home leg of their tie against the Lithuanian team Ekranas. Wenger has ruled out Senderos and Clichy until October but hopes to have Ljungberg back from an ankle injury shortly after Arsenal's Premiership campaign starts on August 19. Sol Campbell has agreed to tell Portsmouth in the next 48 hours whether he plans to take up their contract offer. The central defender is a free agent after being released by Arsenal and is considering staying in the Premiership after initially stating he wanted to take up a fresh challenge abroad. Campbell held talks last weekend with Harry Redknapp, who has made the 31-year-old his principal central defensive target, putting on hold a move for Manchester City's Sylvain Distin while he awaits a response. The Portsmouth manager wants another experienced centre-half and is not put off by Campbell's injury problems and sometimes shaky form last season. Campbell also has offers from abroad but Newcastle United have dropped their interest in him. Redknapp remains keen to strengthen other positions. The Internazionale striker Obafemi Martins is another on his list and Portsmouth are considering an offer for the Nigeria international, who is understood to be valued at more than \u00a312m. Inter are thought to be reluctant to release the 21-year-old, but they could offer Martins on a season's loan if they can sign a front-line player. Arsenal's new 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium will stage a South American derby between Brazil and Argentina on September 2. The international will be Alfio Basile's first as Argentina's head coach and the second for the new Brazil coach Dunga. West Ham United have completed the signing of the Ghana right-back John Paintsil from Hapoel Tel-Aviv for a fee that could rise to \u00a31m. The 25-year-old, who needs to obtain a work permit, has been given a four-year contract after impressing while on trial. Paintsil's versatility has also seen him used at centre-back and left-back by his country in the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
