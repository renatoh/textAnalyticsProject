The main indices have sunk over 4%, taking them down to one-week lows. Here\u2019s Marketwatch\u2019s take: Wednesday\u2019s action comes as U.S. investors are coming to grips with the prospect of a long haul for the economy and the markets amid a pandemic that has been contracted by more than 800,000 people world-wide. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that a \u201cvery, very painful\u201d two weeks lie ahead for the country in face of a rapidly spreading COVID-19 epidemic, which originated in December in Wuhan, China and has brought much of the world to a screeching halt to slow the spread of the deadly pathogen. Goodnight, GW It appears that the clampdown on UK banks came JUST too late to prevent top executives receiving their bonuses - which will have run into millions of pounds for some. Hardly a consolation to small shareholders who just lost their dividend payments. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Millions of pounds of bank bonuses were paid out weeks before the Bank of England banned British lenders from offering cash rewards to their most senior executives as the coronavirus crisis escalates. In an intervention that sent banking shares tumbling on Wednesday amid renewed turbulence in financial markets, Threadneedle Street ordered Britain\u2019s biggest high street banks late on Tuesday to cancel almost \u00a38bn of dividend payments due to be made to investors this year, and told firms to scrap cash bonuses for top staff, or \u201cmaterial risk takers\u201d. However, banking industry sources said the bulk of cash bonuses will have already landed in executives\u2019 accounts, including as recently as last week at some of the biggest banks. According to a Guardian analysis of the bonus plans for employee performance at five of the UK\u2019s biggest banks in 2019, which are payable this year, more than half a billion pounds of cash payouts had been earmarked for top executives. Insiders said bonuses are usually paid alongside bankers\u2019 March pay cheques, including at the British firms with the biggest investment banking bonus pots \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered.... More here: With an hour\u2019s trading to go, Wall Street is still showing heavy losses. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 3.9%. Boeing is the top faller, down 12%, as the crisis in the airline sector rages on. American Express has lost 8.6%, on fears that a protracted lockdown will hurt consumer spending -- see also Apple\u2019s 5% slide, and Visa\u2019s 4.8% drop. These are dark times for Britain\u2019s film industry - both those who produce movies, and those who help us see them: I failed to mention this earlier (despite my colleague Mark Sweney drawing it to my attention!) London-based Dazn, the sports-only streaming service owned by the billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, is to defer payments for the rights to postponed events such as Champions League and Premier League that it has in various countries. The company, which has also moved to \u201cfurlough\u201d an unspecified number of its 2,600 mostly UK-based staff, said it has taken the measures to \u201cenable the business to survive this difficult time\u201d. In another sign of economic woe, nearly one million people have applied for Universal Credit benefits since the government ordered pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops to close: Brent crude has had a bad day too, sliding by 5% to $24.87 per barrel right now. That reflects ongoing concern that the Covid-19 pandemic will hurt global demand, and that Saudi Arabia will maintain its price war and keep pumping. It\u2019s a challenge for oil majors - and BP is responding by slashing billions of dollars off its spending: Here\u2019s my colleague Gwyn Topham on the push to rescue Virgin Atlantic: Virgin Atlantic\u2019s quest for a state bailout has been backed by some of aviation\u2019s biggest companies, with the aerospace giants Airbus and Rolls-Royce as well as Heathrow all lobbying the government on the airline\u2019s behalf. The trio have sent letters to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week urging state assistance for Sir Richard Branson\u2019s airline, which is seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in loans and credit guarantees with planes grounded and bookings vanishing because of coronavirus. Virgin has ordered a fleet of Airbus 330 aircraft, with Rolls-Royce engines, whose wings are made at the Airbus Broughton plant in north Wales. The airline also had plans before the coronavirus to expand at London Heathrow. In one of the letters, according to Sky News, John Harrison, the general counsel and UK chairman of Airbus, said that Virgin\u2019s \u201ccollapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 programme\u201d. He added: \u201cAs you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business.\u201d Rolls-Royce has also stressed the \u201csignificant importance\u201d of Virgin\u2019s custom to the company and its UK supply chain. A Heathrow spokesperson confirmed that the airport had written on Virgin\u2019s behalf, and said: \u201cThe government must take urgent steps now to safeguard the future of the sector or it will risk undermining the recovery of Britain\u2019s economy once we beat the virus.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: In other Airbus news.... the company has loaded more than 400,000 surgical masks destined on to trucks at its HQ in Toulouse, France, to help deal with the UK\u2019s shortage of protective equipment for healthcare workers. The cargo is part of a batch of 6 million that have already been brought to Europe from China using several Airbus test aircraft. Airbus said it had established an air bridge to China to bring large quantities of surgical masks to Europe to support governments in the fight against COVID-19. The first UK consignment is due to arrive at Airbus\u2019 Broughton site in North Wales on Friday. Here\u2019s some footage of the masks being loaded. Construction Leadership Council, an industry body, is calling on construction companies to help the NHS by providing urgently needed protective equipment, such as face masks, visors, goggles, hand sanitizer and full body suits. But, it\u2019s worth noting that some building sites are still open and workers have complained of having to work in crowded conditions, with little or no hand sanitizer available on site. Some have taken to social media to voice fears over their health and jobs. After the worst quarter since the financial crisis, US and European stock markets have made a poor start to Q2: Every European market fell, while Wall Street is deep in the red too. David Madden of CMC Markets explains that fears over the Covid-19 pandemic in the US and Europe are hurting shares. Stocks are sharply lower as health fears continue to loom over the markets. The first quarter was dreadful and the second quarter is starting off on a negative note. The Covid-19 related death toll in the US has overtaken that of China, and President Trump has warned about a \u2018very, very painful two weeks\u2019 ahead. The surge in stocks seen on the back of various stimulus plans from central banks, and rescue packages from governments around the globe seems like a distant memory, and traders are bracing themselves for a deepening health crisis. Germany has extended the nationwide lockdown until 19 April \u2013 it will prolong the economic pain in Europe\u2019s largest country. He also points out that clouds are gathering over the airlines (Virgin is not alone!): It has been a tough few weeks for the airline sector, and today is no different, as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) cautioned the sector could incur a net loss of $39 billion in the second-quarter, should the flight restrictions last for three months. The IATA pointed out that fixed costs and semi-fixed costs in the industry equate to roughly 50% of airlines costs, so trimming expenses might not be easy. Wizz Air and easyJet are underperformers in the sector. Investors may need a swift drink from Beer Is Here, given today\u2019s stock market action. The FTSE 100 has just ended the day down 217 points, or 3.8%, at 5454 - its lowest closing level in a week. Bank shares were hammered, after they were forced to cancel dividend payments and bonuses last night. Barclays and Lloyds both sank by 11%. Cruise operator Carnival was the worst performer, falling by 20% a day after warning that demand may never recover from the Covid-19 crisis. Airlines aren\u2019t the only industry struggling right now, of course. Britain\u2019s brewers have also been hit, hard, by the government\u2019s lockdown rules and the forced closures of pubs. But all isn\u2019t lost, thirsty readers. A website called Beer Is Here is trying to keep small breweries alive, by connecting them with customers. Type in your postcode and it pulls up a list of breweries near you that deliver or do takeaway, and who may be very grateful for the business right now.... A group of civil society organisations have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to demand that any bailouts for the airline industry come with strict conditions. They argue that airline workers need to be protected, but that the industry must be forced to address its contribution to the climate emergency, and to local air and noise pollution. It\u2019s a timely intervention, given the pressure building to rescue Virgin Atlantic. The group, including Greenpeace, Amnesty International, Common Wealth and Friends of the Earth, say: While all of our minds are rightly focused on the need to protect ourselves and our communities against the serious health threat of COVID-19 and its wider economic impacts, the climate and nature emergencies have not gone away and are quietly getting worse. Indeed, aviation sector carbon emissions are increasing globally, and airports are a major contributor to local air and noise pollution, risking public health. Any bailouts that are granted must be used to address these challenges together, and avoid exacerbating them. Therefore any support packages for airline companies must set conditions to protect workers\u2019 rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reorientate the industry towards helping to meet the Paris climate agreement. Demand reduction measures should be implemented gradually over time to bring the sector within safe limits for the climate. The group also want the government to take a controlling stake in any airlines it rescues, so it can drive through change, and to guarantee workers rights - including no lay-offs during the coronavirus emergency. A petition has been set up on the UK parliament website, urging ministers to decline any requests for bailouts from the airline industry. It argues that aviation should not be supported with government investment or subsidies, given it is a cause of climate change. Employees should be helped to move into \u2018greener\u2019 transport instead. It\u2019s currently got 1,476 signatures -- the government must respond if it hits 10,000..... Decline any requests for bailouts from the airline industry Travel website The Points Guy reported on Monday that Virgin had drastically cut back its routes, with most planes grounded: For most of April, Virgin Atlantic will only operate three routes in its route network. Between 29 March and 19 April 2020, the carrier will only operate flights between London Heathrow (LHR) and New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX) and Hong Kong (HKG). My colleague Gwyn Topham wrote last week that Virgin was pushing for a state aid package: The airline declined to comment, but was understood to have approached the government and bankers, Rothschild, who are handling negotiations, for a package worth hundreds of millions of pounds in commercial loans and guarantees. The loans would cover fixed costs rather than staffing. Credit guarantees would allow passenger revenues for future bookings to be passed on to the airline rather than retained by credit card companies \u2013 removing one of the issues that helped sink Flybe as its financial woes became apparent. The Financial Times reports that Virgin Atlantic is seeking a \u00a3500m bailout package of commercial loans and guarantees to survive the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also confirm that Airbus and Rolls-Royce are doing their bit! In the letters, seen by the Financial Times, Warren East, chief executive at Rolls-Royce, wrote on Wednesday that \u201cVirgin\u2019s business is of significant importance to Rolls-Royce, our extensive UK supply chain, and manufacturing operations.\u201d Meanwhile, John Harrison, general counsel at Airbus and a board member, warned that Virgin\u2019s collapse could have an \u201cextremely negative impact\u201d on the manufacturer\u2019s A330 aircraft programme, which has its wings designed and manufactured in the UK. The Covid-19 crisis is putting all airlines under severe pressures, including Virgin Atlantic - who has been hit by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, and flight restrictions elsewhere. Now, Sky News reports, a \u201cfrantic lobbying campaign\u201d to secure taxpayer support for Virgin Atlantic Airways is underway. Apparently it involves two of the aviation industry\u2019s biggest manufacturers, Airbus and Rolls-Royce Holdings, and Heathrow Airport - who are also all suffering from the crisis. These businesses have separately to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, to urge the government to \u201cdo all it can to support Virgin in these extremely difficult times\u201d. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman explains: In one letter, John Harrison, general counsel and UK chairman of Airbus, warned that Virgin Atlantic\u2019s \u201ccollapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 [aircraft manufacturing] programme\u201d. \u201cAs you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business,\u201d Mr Harrison wrote. Similar messages are understood to have been communicated by Heathrow and Rolls-Royce, both of which are also significant customers of Virgin Atlantic. One industry source said the letters had been written at the instigation of the British airline. Virgin has said it plans to ground 85% of its fleet, and terminate its route between Heathrow and Newark. The airline industry has been making increasingly vocal noises about needing help for weeks, with potential lost revenue from Covid-19 spiralling into the hundreds of billions of dollars. But rescuing airlines is tricky territory for governments. There\u2019s no certainty when flights will resume as normal. Should taxypayers really help keep planes in the air anyway, given the climate crisis? The optics of rescuing Virgin Airlines aren\u2019t great either, given company founder Sir Richard Branson is a billionaire with his own luxury island [Branson has committed $250m of his fortune to help his empire] Newsflash: Output across America\u2019s factories slumped at the fastest rate since the financial crisis last month. Data firm Markit reports that US manufacturing output declined at the fastest pace since August 2009 in March, as the COVID-19 outbreak intensified. New orders and employment also contracted at the fastest rate since the financial crisis, and business confidence slumped (which largely mirrors the picture in the UK and eurozone!). Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says there\u2019s worse to come: \u201cGrowing numbers of company closures and lockdowns as the nation fights the COVID-19 outbreak mean business levels have collapsed. While some producers reported being busier as a result of stockpiling and anti-virus activities, notably in the food and healthcare sectors, these are very much the minority, and most sectors reported a rapid deterioration in demand and production. Not a good start to April: The New York stock exchange has begun the new quarter as it ended the old one - with a wave of selling. The Dow Jones Industrial average has plunged by 4% at the start of trading, shedding 864 points to 21,053. That\u2019s a one-week low, I reckon. The broader S&amp;P 500 index surrendered 94 points, or 3.6%, falling back to 2,489 points, while the Nasdaq dropped 3%. Donald Trump\u2019s warning of a \u201cvery, very painful\u201d two weeks lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic continues has clearly alarmed investors, crushing any lingering hopes that the outbreak could be contained easily. Brazil\u2019s factories have suffered a slump in output last month, with falling orders triggering a jump in job cuts: Many commodity prices are down today, as traders anticipate less demand for copper, iron and platinum as the world economy stumbles: The oil price war has claimed its first US shale producer: Whiting Petroleum. The latest US jobs report is out.... and fails to give a true picture of the economic cost of Covid-19. The monthly payroll report from ADP shows that US companies cut their workforce by 27,000 last month. But the data only runs to 12 March, so fails to catch the coronavirus lockdown (which caused jobless claims to spike by over 3 million the following week). But the ADP report does show one thing -- small US firms were already cutting back, reducing their headcount by 90,000. On Friday, the official Non-Farm Payroll will give a more timely (and grizzlier) view of the US economy last month. Allianz\u2019s chief economist, Mohamed El-Erian, fears that companies who can\u2019t access loans, or issue debt, will face solvency problems soon. Speaking on CNBC, El-Erian explained here are two groups of companies right now. One has access to the debt market, and \u201cthey are taking on a ton of debt... building a ton of cash\u201d. That will help them through the Covid-19 crisis, but such a debt pile will hurt their credit worthiness in future. Those on the other side have an immediate problem - no access to loans or debt issuance. \u201cFor them, a liquidity problem will become a solvency issue,\u201d says El-Erian. This means a reversible shock will become a permanent capital impairment shock The markets are still working through this issue, he adds, but the upshot is \u201clower valuations from here\u201d. Time for a market recap..... and European stock markets are still down sharply. The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s largest companies is down 3%, with heavy losses across the region. In London the FTSE 100 is still down over 200 points , or 3.8%. Banks are still suffering from their dividend cancellation last night: HSBC: down 37p or 8.3% at 416p Barclays: down 6.4p or 6.8% at 87p Royal Bank of Scotland: down 5.9p or 5.2% at 107p Standard Chartered: down 34p or 7.7% at 411p Lloyds: down 1.8p or 5.8% at 30p Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and has already apologised for the way it began its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, is trying to make further amends by committing to restrict the salaries of its top executives to a maximum of \u00a340,000. It has also pledged to pay \u201cvirtually\u201d all its \u201cdirect retail and head office staff their salaries until at least the end of April 2020\u201d. In an email to staff sent on Tuesday, the company\u2019s boss Mike Ashley said that by making the pledge it has guaranteed March and April salaries for over 20,000 individuals, during which time the group\u2019s shops are likely to remain closed. He added: \u201cAs part of this, our senior management team have taken voluntary pay reductions to ensure the group has the best chance of continuity. Each individual has reduced their basic pay to a maximum of \u00a340,000 a year, taking effect from May onwards. This is a tremendous first step and show of support towards securing the future of the Frasers Group.\u201d Ashley is not paid a salary by the group, which he founded (and is still majority shareholder). While the news will be welcomed by the company\u2019s shop and office workers, the email made no reference to plans for the thousands of agency staff that work in the group\u2019s giant Derbyshire warehouse in Shirebrook. The facility remains open to fulfill online orders and the company has suggested it has been struggling to enforce coronavirus safety rules inside the depot, where some workers say they feel pressured into turning up for work. The union Unite has called for Shirebrook workers to be sent home on full pay, while the TUC has called today for the government to publish tough new rules about safety for businesses that are staying open \u2013 and to close them down if they won\u2019t comply. Last week Ashley issued a public apology following a spat with the government about trying to keep his Sports Direct chain open when non-essential businesses were ordered to close, arguing that selling sporting and fitness equipment made the company a vital asset as Britons were forced to stay at home. He reversed the decision and said: \u201cI am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days. Given what has taken place over the last few days, I thought it was necessary to address and apologise for much of what has been reported across various media outlets regarding my personal actions and those of the Frasers Group business.\u201d Incidentally, the big fall in employment at UK factories last month does not seem to include workers who have been temporarily furloughed: More furloughing news: The most surprising story of the morning is that British American Tobacco is, it says, working on a potential vaccine for COVID-19 using proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. In happier times, this could have been an April Fool\u2019s joke (we\u2019ve seen worse over the years). But BAT insist that it\u2019s true. My colleague Mark Sweney explains: Tobacco giant BAT, maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson &amp; Hedges, has said it has a potential coronavirus vaccine in development.The company said that its US bio-tech subsidiary is in pre-clinical testing using \u201cnew, fast-growing tobacco plant technology\u201d. BAT is hopeful that, with the right partners and support from government agencies, between 1 and 3 million doses of the vaccine could be manufactured per week, beginning in June,\u201d the company said. BAT, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said that its work on coronavirus is being carried out on a not-for-profit basis. BAT\u2019s plan is to use a cloned portion of COVID-19\u2019s genetic sequence to create an antigen that is then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction. Once harvested, the antigens are extracted and purified and inserted into the body. This prompts the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the antigen. Those antibodies would also fight the Covid-19 pathogen, giving resistance to the virus. Whether BAT\u2019s biotech experts will actually deliver a breakthrough is another matter. Many other companies are close to human trials of potential vaccines... but that process can take months, as ineffective or downright dangerous options are weeded out. Some vaccinologists believe it could take 18 months for a Covid-19 vaccine to be fully developed, properly tested and approved for human use. Still, given the urgent need for a vaccine, let\u2019s hope BAT are onto something. M&amp;S is offering retail staff who carry on working during coronavirus outbreak a 15% bonus. It says that taking furlough is voluntary, so those with caring commitments or who are feeling more vulnerable are able to stay at home. Any staff member who is furloughed will do so on full pay. Store staff also being offered personal plastic face shields which they say are better than masks as they can be easily cleaned and don\u2019t need to be adjusted (which can lead to face touching. Economists are alarmed by today\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI report. Here\u2019s some reaction: Jeremy Thomson Cook, Chief Economist at Equals: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector has essentially come to a standstill. The shuttering of businesses and the complete dissolution of supply chains means that the sector that accounts for around 1/7th of the UK economy is effectively closed for business. While new orders, as well as delivery times, can reverse quickly as businesses rebuild inventories, the worst decline in employment since July 2009 shows that a recovery will not be quite as instantaneous.\u201d \u201cThere is optimism amongst businesses that output will be higher in a year\u2019s time, which the nation will certainly be hoping is the case.\u201d Seamus Nevin, Chief Economist at Make UK \u201cToday may be April Fool\u2019s Day but this result is no joke. A PMI score of 47.8 amidst the ongoing Covid19 outbreak is a sign of just how hard manufacturers have been hit. \u201cMany firms have had to shut and lots of those that remain open have seen orders or output suffer. Others have switched to making products that are vital to the national attempt to stop the spread of the virus; a testament to why backing manufacturing is so important. \u201cAt the start of this year manufacturing companies reported unprecedented optimism about investment and trade but that had all been swept away by current events. With estimates suggesting up to a fifth of smaller firms could go out of business in the next few months Coronavirus has highlighted the need to maintain and develop our domestic manufacturing base. The Chancellor has rightly intervened to help but even still costs are going up. A 6.2% increase in the national living wage came into effect this morning. With expectations of further restrictions and economic disruption to come Business optimism is that a record low and may continue to worsen in the months ahead\u201d Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Miton. \u201cThe economic data coming out of Europe this morning is not comforting, but that\u2019s no surprise. Confidence about the future in Italy and Spain sank to levels not seen before, suggesting worse is to come. The UK, France and Germany showed similar traits. Equity markets in Europe will be under pressure, compounded by the UK banking sector cancelling dividends.\u201d Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet Wealth Management flags up that the headline PMI number is flattered by delivery problems: Manufacturers of puzzles, board games and educational toys should be enjoying a surge in demand. Sales has soared last month, as people try to enjoy home confinement as best they can (nothing passes the time like a spirited row over who biffed Dr Black in the lounge with the candlestick) My colleague Sarah Butler reports: Sales of boardgames and puzzles soared 240% during the lockdown as Brits turned to old favourites including Monopoly, Scrabble, Cluedo while stuck at home according to data from market research firm NPD Group. Monopoly Classic was the best selling toy with card game Dobble at number three but Lego\u2019s complex construction kits of cars such as a Bugatti and a Land Rover Defender were also among the top-selling toys suggesting that adults were also looking for entertainment to while away the hours. As parents struggled to entertain kids with something at least partly educational, sales of art and craft gear nearly doubled with slime and dough kits on the shopping list while building set sales were up 59%. Alarmingly, some UK companies are at risk of collapse because they cannot access the government\u2019s emergency support measures. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Almost a fifth of small businesses are at risk of collapsing within the next month as they struggle to secure emergency cash meant to support them through the coronavirus lockdown, according to research by an accountancy network. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has pledged unprecedented aid to companies to try to cushion the blow from much of the economy shutting down but businesses and politicians have raised concerns that there are gaps in the schemes. Some 18% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) either probably or definitely will not be able to obtain additional cash from the government to survive for a four-week period, according to the Corporate Finance Network. Its accountancy firm members estimated that almost a third of their 13,000 small-company clients from around the UK would be unable to acquire the cash needed to ride out an extended, three-month lockdown..... Despite the government\u2019s lockdown, some companies are still encouraging workers into the office. And the unions aren\u2019t happy, and are demanding much better protection for those who can\u2019t work from home. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears that some are being exposed to unnecessary Covid-19 risk because their employers are not putting adequate safety measures in place. The TUC is calling for: Strong new rules from government on the safety measures employers should put in place Every employer that expects workers to come in to work to complete a full formal risk assessment, following government guidance and with the involvement of their staff unions. A new enforcement body, involving employers, unions and the Health and Safety Executive. This body would have the power to issue enforcement notices for immediate compliance and to shut down workplaces if employers fail to comply. Similar arrangements are already in place in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Protection for workers who refuse to go to work during this period because they are genuinely afraid that they\u2019re being put at avoidable Covid-19 risk Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics wins today\u2019s Spotters Prize: March was grim for UK factories (and their counterparts around the world), but April will surely be worse. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u201cWith supply chains crumbling around the world, we can only expect a worsening outlook next month as increasingly necessary lockdown measures squeeze manufacturing production. Only creative and agile thinking, new products and approaches will see the sector through the turbulence ahead.\u201d More bad news. UK factories are cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the great recession more than a decade ago. Manufacturers have reported that production contracted sharply last month. Output and new orders both fell at the fastest rate since July 2012. Factories also suffered transport delays and shortages of raw materials, due to global efforts to combat Covid-19. Data firm Markit, which compiled the report, says bosses are their most pessimistic since their survey began 28 years ago. The downturns in output and new orders were widespread, with contractions seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sub-industries. Manufacturers reported that disruption resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, lower market confidence and company shutdowns had all contributed to the drops in production and new business. Business sentiment was also affected, falling to a series-record low. With demand slumping at home, and abroad, many customers cancelled orders. And this has led to sharp job losses. Markit says: Employment fell for the eleventh time in the past 12 months in March, and at the fastest rate since July 2009. Where job losses were reported, these were linked to lower levels of production and new orders, in many cases due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Redundancies, workforce restructuring, natural wastage and only replacing essential positions all contributed to lower staff headcount. This dragged Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI down to a three-month low of 47.8 (showing a contraction). Confusingly, the real picture is probably worse, as supplier delays and supply shortages boost the PMI (they normally indicate strong economic demand). UK banks may have acted together last night, but they did so under duress. City regulators effectively forced the banks to scrap dividends, to strengthen their finances. As The Times puts it: The co-ordinated action came after the Prudential Regulation Authority gave banks an 8pm deadline to agree to cancel dividend payments and share buybacks and to make a statement by 9pm. If they did not do so, the PRA warned that it could use its supervisory powers to force banks to comply. Newsflash: European factories had a torrid time in March, particularly in Italy, Greece and France. Manufacturers have reported that output and new orders slumped last month, due to the impact of Covid-19 shutdowns, forcing a surge in job cuts. This dragged the Eurozone manufacturing PMI (a survey of purchasing managers) down to just 44.5, from 49.2 in February. That\u2019s shows a very sharp contraction (50=stagnation), and is the lowest reading since 2012. It\u2019s also worse than last week\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 reading, showing that conditions worsened during last month. Manufacturing output, new orders and exports all fell at the fastest rate since the spring of 2009 (when the global economy was in recession). Markit adds that this forced many bosses to lay staff off: Manufacturers also cut their employment levels over the month, with the net reduction in staffing numbers the sharpest recorded by the survey in over a decade. Job losses were especially acute in Austria, Germany and Ireland. UK banks aren\u2019t the only companies taking drastic action to cope with Covid-19. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has announced that its directors have cancelled their bonus scheme for 2020, and are taking a 30% pay cut for the duration of the coronavirus lockdown. Car selling service Autotrader is taking even more drastic action. Its board are taking a pay cut of at least 50%, and putting many of their staff on furlough (so the government will pick up 80% of their wages). Autotrader is also issuing new shares, to bolster its capital reserves, and reckons its unlikely to pay a dividend for 2020. Fairly intensive selling has now driven the FTSE 100 down by over 4%, down 235 points at 5434. The banks are doing plenty of damage, along with other financial stocks such as Legal &amp; General (-10%), Standard Life Aberdeen (-8.5%) , Aviva (-8.4%) and Prudential (-8.1%). Broadcaster ITV are also struggling, down 8%, with luxury chain Burberry down 7.6%. In fact, every single share on the Footsie is down, as markets start the new quarter on the back foot (or possibly on their knees!) John Cronin of Irish investment bank Goodbody says that the UK banks have gone further than expected. He told clients this morning: It was heavier-handed than we thought on two fronts: i) we expected that both proposed dividends \u2013 and dividends for the next six months \u2013 would be suspended, not cancelled; and ii) we were surprised that the variable remuneration restrictions are wider in their application, i.e., they stretch beyond just the executive layer. On the latter, hopefully, it will be a postponement rather than a cancellation for 2020 to the extent that banks show they can get through the worst of this crisis with their capital positions intact \u2013 which we believe they will. Anyone whose held bank shares for the last decade or so may wonder why they bothered. Owning HSBC stock has been a volatile ride -- but not one that has returned to the good old days before the financial crisis: Lloyds, meanwhile, has been grim - ever since the disastrous merger with HBOS (subsequently described as a \u2018mugging\u2019 in the high court) Of course, there have been dividend payments to cushion the blow.... but not any more. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says the UK banks may be doing the right thing for the economy....but at the expense of their shareholders: \u201cThe announcement that banks will be suspending existing and future dividends and share buybacks ticks the boxes of moral duty and an additional capacity to lend, but from an investment perspective it removes a core plank of the case for buying bank shares. The current yield of the UK banks, soon to evaporate, is testament to the fact that some are core portfolio holdings. Lloyds Banking has a dividend yield at present of 10.5%, Barclays 9.6%, Royal Bank of Scotland 4.4%, HSBC 9% and Standard Chartered 4.9%. From a technical perspective, it also begs the question of how or whether these share prices will be compensated for the previous ex-dividend markdowns. On ex-dividend day, share prices are reduced by the amount of the upcoming dividend, which already applies to Barclays and HSBC (both 27th February), Standard Chartered (5th March) and Royal Bank of Scotland (26th March). It is unclear whether this can be reversed. Oof! Shares in Britain\u2019s banks have fallen heavily at the start of trading, after they collectively cancelled last year\u2019s dividends and vowed not to pay any for this year. HSBC have tumbled by 8%, closely followed by Lloyds (-5.8%), Standard Chartered (-5.8%), Barclays (-5.6%), and Royal Bank of Scotland (-3.5%). This has dragged the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares down to 5487 points, down 187 points or 3.3%. That more than wipes out yesterday\u2019s 100 point leap. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading, with Germany\u2019s DAX sliding by 3.2%, Spain\u2019s IBEX down 2.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 2.2%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.5%...but it\u2019s a rocky open, as the bank shares haven\u2019t actually traded yet (a bad sign...). Tin hats to the ready..... Britain\u2019s biggest banks are all cancelling their dividends, due to the economic shock of Covid-19. It\u2019s a blow to millions of small shareholders and pension holders, although it will make the banks stronger to handle the looming threat of loan defaults as the UK lurches into recession. It will also rattle the City of London, and help drive markets down today. Late last night HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group axed their outstanding 2019 dividends, to protect their cash reserves. They have all agreed not to make dividend payments in 2020, and to suspend share buybacks, in a flurry of co-ordinated announcements. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains the impact: The cancellation of the 2019 dividends will give the banks an additional financial cushion worth nearly \u00a38bn in total, as they are pushed to increase lending to businesses and households during the Covid-19 lockdown. The decisions will be felt most immediately by Barclays shareholders who were set to receive more than \u00a31bn on Friday. Barclays said the decision to scrap the 2019 payout was \u201cin response to a request from the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and to preserve additional capital for use in serving Barclays\u2019 customers and clients\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Good news! The worst quarter for the London stock market since 1987 is over. Bad News! The new quarter is getting off to a bad start too. Stocks have fallen across Asia today, and European markets are expected to follow, as investors grow more anxious about the Covid-19 crisis. The FTSE 100, which slumped by almost 25% in the first quarter of this year, is on track to drop by over 3% this morning, as the global economy continues to deteriorate fast. Anxiety about the extent of the global recession is mounting. With the global death toll passing 42,000, and nearly 860,000 infections recorded, hopes that the global economy could bounce back from the economic shock look optimistic. Last night, US president Donald Trump predicted that America faces two \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d, with experts warning that up to 240,000 lives could be lost, even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained. This warning knocked Wall Street futures into the red, pushing Japan\u2019s Nikkei down 4.5% and nudging China\u2019s CSI300 index into the red. Also coming up today Data firm Markit\u2019s latest UK, eurozone and US purchasing manager surveys will show how badly factories have suffered from the Covid-19 shutdown in March. The \u2018flash\u2019 PMI readings released last week were grim -- with heavy slumps in output as manufacturers shut down. Today\u2019s final readings should have more detail, including for Spanish and Italian factories. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: The final numbers don\u2019t often change much from the flash but given the severity of the lockdowns in the second half of the month this will be one to watch. We\u2019ll also get a first look at Italy and Spain which given their more savage impact from the virus, these will be a big focus.
