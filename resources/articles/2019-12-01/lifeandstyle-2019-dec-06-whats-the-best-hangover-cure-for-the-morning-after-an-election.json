This meant that soon after coming home at 2am, merry and hot from booze, I began to dehydrate, dry heat wrinkling my wine-soaked body like an expensive cured sausage, although I didn\u2019t feel so tasty. I have been working on my hangovers for years (tinkering, testing), trying to optimise them. I\u2019ve tried it all \u2013 pickle juice, milk thistle \u2013 because if I can just remove the nausea and the nagging feeling that my colleagues hate me, hangovers could be wonderful. They are, as friends with children can attest, an immense privilege: lie-ins, fry-ups and binge-watching. Of course, the only true cure is abstinence, but the search has led me to discover \u201cemotional hangovers\u201d. An emotional hangover is the empty, lethargic feeling you have post-BNO, but without drinking. Usually, it follows an intense experience, be it the joy of getting married, or the disappointment of a failed test. Apparently, the brain responds to heightened emotion in a similar way to booze and reels from it in the same way. Perhaps my hangovers haven\u2019t been in vain, because in between festive boozing this year, there\u2019s an election \u2013 an extremely stressful and urgent contest, the significance of which exceeds anything I\u2019ve seen. Despite never having had the pleasure of voting in an election where my party wins, I am still unprepared for it to lose. Next week\u2019s result will probably leave me with a hangover of both kinds. And when I think of that morning, the reckoning, I know I won\u2019t have a strategy to deal with it. But I have learned this tip I will share with you: that egg and chips and a bottle of Lucozade isn\u2019t the worst place to start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
