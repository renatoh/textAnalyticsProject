And, when we did eventually get to see an AA (now 15) or X (18) certificate movie on TV, the sex and violence would have been cut out. Today's home-viewing discs have extra, naughtier bits thrown in. The point of this generational lament is that I had always assumed that the easy availability of movies would end the possibility of a film being a television event. If millions of households had bought or rented their own copy of a Hollywood blockbuster, why would they be excited about a network showing it much later? Certainly, schedulers seemed to follow this logic, recently favouring extended editions of television hits over bought-in feature films. But, with the recent cuts in TV-drama budgets, Tinseltown products have been used to fill the slots. BBC1 has just given almost three hours of Wednesday night peak-time to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a film that had already attracted huge box-office and box-set returns. Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl, another widely seen piece, filled a Saturday night. Pirates was watched by 4.7m viewers and Potter by 5.3m, not far short of the performance of even the most popular home-made dramas such as EastEnders and Holby City. This is good news for channel controllers, but possibly ominous for producers of drama. It was once widely predicted that television plays would kill off movie dramas; on these figures, the concern now lies in the opposite direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
