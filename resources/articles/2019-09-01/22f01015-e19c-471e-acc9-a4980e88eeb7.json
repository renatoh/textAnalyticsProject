Speaking at the Sydney Opera House\u2019s Antidote festival, Ho told an audience of mostly self-identifying Hongkongers that the political upheaval in their home had reached \u201ca point of no turning back\u201d. \u201cWe are in a state of humanitarian crisis where police have full authority to do whatever they want with the people, and the government is hiding behind the police force,\u201d she said. As protests in Hong Kong headed towards their 14th week, Ho reflected on the resilience and tenacity of the protesters, who have turned out in hundreds of thousands since the first demonstrations in June. \u201cWhere does this courage come from? Hong Kong has never been known to be a politically conscious society,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing like this has ever been seen before and now people have been pushed to this edge \u2013 these young people are fighting for their lives and for their future.\u201d She rejected allegations by Beijing that the movement was being provoked by the US or other international players. \u201cThis is a leaderless, centralised movement,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are still claiming there are foreign forces coming into the movement \u2026 it\u2019s just not the truth.\u201d Before she was an activist, Ho was a singer. She launched her music career in the 1990s when she won a singing competition run by a Hong Kong TV station, but it wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s that she broke through into the mainstream. She began to identify publicly as a lesbian in 2012 \u2013 the first person in Cantopop to come out \u2013 and became an advocate for LGBT+ rights. In 2014 she was arrested for taking part in the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. As a result she was blacklisted in mainland China, where she had a growing audience, and was dropped from major sponsorship deals and by her record label. She responded by starting her own label, and by intensifying her political activism. Despite being billed as a talk about pop and politics, Ho\u2019s session at the annual ideas festival focused firmly on the latter. In conversation with the journalist Zing Tsjeng, Ho touched on her singing career only insofar as it related to her activism. Art and creative practice, she said, was a space in which \u201cthe fight can go on\u201d. \u201cThey can lock you up, they can ban you from going into the country, and they can censor your name on Chinese social media, but they cannot really control your mind.\u201d She said she believed most celebrities had been \u201csilencing themselves\u201d on the political situation in Hong Kong \u201cfor fear of being blacklisted, as I have been, on the China market\u201d. The audience gave no indication that they minded the singular focus of the event. Crowd members chanted pro-freedom slogans. Questions from the floor were focused mainly on protest strategy. They wanted to know what they could do from Australia to help their families at home. They called out in encouragement and support when the event took an emotional turn. Ho was brought to tears as the audience was shown a short video summarising the months of protests, which were triggered in June by the introduction of a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China to face court. The bill was seen as an attempt by Beijing to undermine democracy in the relatively liberal territory, governed by China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework. News had emerged in the past 48 hours that police had fired dye-filled water cannons at people in the street. They had disguised their identities and violently arrested protesters, as well as attacking them in a train carriage at a metro station, pepper spraying them and beating them with batons. \u201cThe police have really been completely out of hand, and so Hong Kong people are furious,\u201d Ho said. Ho said she expected the crisis to escalate in the lead-up to celebrations on 1 October to mark the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u201cWhat will happen during this month, nobody will really answer this question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we can really do in this moment is become more united in this fight and become really strategic in the face of this huge machine that is the [Chinese] communist government.\u201d She said six young people had killed themselves \u201cbecause of despair\u201d during the protest period. \u201cI really want the world to know that although we are seeing a lot of violence from all sides at this moment, this really started out as a largely peaceful protest in June,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried all sorts of ways to get our voices heard, to get to the government. But they only responded with teargas, more teargas, rubber bullets, sponge bullets, police brutality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
