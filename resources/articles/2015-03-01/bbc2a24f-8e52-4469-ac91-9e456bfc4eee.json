A miasma of despair and evil seeps into every corner of the world that director Gerard Johnson conjures up, like carbon monoxide. DI Michael Logan (Peter Ferdinando) is a Met drug squad officer who has secretly invested \u00a3100,000 in a cocaine route being opened by a Turkish gang. When this connection is brutally taken over by a couple of murderous Albanian brothers, Michael has to open a discreet channel of communication with them if he is to get his money back \u2013 something he explains away to his menacing superior officer DI David Knight (Stephen Graham) as cultivating intelligence sources. It is an ambiguous practice that has made corruption a way of life for him, and which is to lead to carnage. This movie has a hint of Donald Cammell and Nic Roeg\u2019s Performance in the west London locations, and Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Pusher trilogy: there are some great scenes simply showing Michael hanging out with his fantastically dodgy crew: Martin (Neil Maskell), Chris (Gordon Brown) and Keith (Tony Pitts). There is great black-comic energy in that group relationship and it is a shame that the plot trajectory takes Martin away from them. The movie moves on to some grandstanding moments, before finally painting itself into a corner. The ending is frustrating: it runs out of ideas before the final credits. But Johnson packs an almighty punch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
