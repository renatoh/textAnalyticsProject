And what a day it was: Pope Francis, in a bold address to Congress, addressed immigration, the death penalty, climate change and abortion. He received several standing ovations (and tears). Endorsements came in from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Kim Kardashian, among others. The pope\u2019s statements on immigration were welcomed by Latino representatives, in particular. Republicans were more mixed in their response: Ben Carson seemed to like the address, Ted Cruz was less happy (except for on religious liberty, abortion and marriage) and Donald Trump dismissed the whole thing more or less out of hand. \u2018Catholics for Jeb!\u2019 politely distanced themselves from the pontiff. The pontiff dined with the homeless in Washington before departing for New York, where he paraded through the city. At a Vespers service at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Pope Francis prayed for those who died in the Hajj stampede at Mecca, and said priests must \u201cbear the shame\u201d of their brothers who abused children. He especially thanked the religious women \u2013 nuns and other sisters \u2013 of the US for their service. Please join us again Friday on the Guardian PopeBlog for day seven of our live coverage. It\u2019s another jam-packed day: the pope will address the United Nations, visit the 9/11 memorial, lead a procession through Central Park and say mass at Madison Square Garden. Join Guardian US tomorrow for more pontifical action on this historic tour. Cardinal Timothy Dolan farewells the pope. After that homily, the words of the Magnificat (The Canticle of Mary) will have extra resonance for the hierarchs of the US church: He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit. He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. Pope Francis pays a special compliment to the religious sisters of the US: In a special way I would like to express my gratitude to the religious women of the US. What would the church be without you? Women of strength. Fighters with that spirit of courage which puts you in the front lines, in the proclamation of the gospel. To you religious women, sisters and mothers of this people, I wish to say thank you. A big thank you. And to tell you that I love you very much. Francis thanks them again and asks them to be patient in their struggles in a changing pastoral environment. The (Spanish-speaking) nuns leap to their feet in applause. More insights from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh. Pope Francis speaks to priests about the privilege of serving God: Yet if we are honest, we know how easy this spirit of generous self-sacrifice can be dampened. There are a couple of ways that this can happen. Both are examples of that spiritual worldliness that weakens our commitment to serve and diminishes the wonder of our first encounter with Christ. We can get caught up mentioning the value of our apostolic works by the standards of efficiency, good management and outward success which govern the business world. Not that these things are unimportant - we have been entrusted with a great responsibility and God\u2019s people rightly expect accountability from us. But the true worth of our apostolate is measured by the value it has in God\u2019s eyes. To see and evaluate things from God\u2019s perspection calls for constant conversation \u2026 and need I say, great humility. This evening my brothers and sisters I have come to join you in prayer. That our vocations will continue to build up the great edifice of God\u2019s Kingdom in this country. I know that as a presbyterate [priesthood] in the midst of God\u2019s people you suffered greatly in the not-distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church in the most vulnerable of her members. I know well that you have come forth from the great tribulation. I accompany you at this time of pain and difficulty and I thank God for the faithful service to his people in the hope of helping you to persevere on the path of fidelity to Jesus Christ. I would have wished my greeting to be warmer, my sentiments of closeness. My sentiments of closeness in the face of tragedy. The tragedy that they suffered in Mecca. In this moment I give assurances of my prayers. I unite myself with you all. A prayer to almighty God, all merciful. Presented without comment. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering about since the pope arrived in the US. I think he genuinely enjoyed the music and dance in Cuba, but has often appeared bored and listless during these gargantuan American liturgies. I suspect that the scale of all this is to remind the pope that while his concerns are with the Global South, North America is a centre of Catholicism that has its own gifts (many of them financial). Tune into the livestream at the top of the liveblog to follow the prayer service. The music and setting are about as sumptuous as you can get. This is high altitude Catholicism. Crux reporter Ines San Martin confirms the service will be in English, with Pope Francis\u2019s own remarks in Spanish. This pope is a real polyglot. Here he comes. The green vestments aren\u2019t a fashion statement by the pontiff. They indicate that the service occurs during ordinary time, one of the liturgical seasons of the Catholic year. It seems Pope Francis will conduct this Vespers service in English. More photos of the girl blessed by Pope Francis: During this tour Pope Francis has made a point of praying before the tabernacle \u2013 where the consecrated bread that Catholics believe is the literal body of Christ is stored - prior to conducting services. Here he prays with Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. The pope blesses a little girl, and she wipes away her tears afterwards. Henry Kissinger is also in the congregation. Pope Francis meets the congregation and is presented with gifts, including a bouquet of flowers and a picture of Our Lady of Guadaloupe. Bishops are kissing the pope\u2019s ring as he enters the cathedral, which Cardinal Dolan calls the \u201cparish church of America\u201d. He blesses a cross and sprinkles those nearby with holy water while another grand choir sings. Pope Francis disembarks the popemobile and is met by Mayor Bill de Blasio, Senator Chuck Schumer and others outside St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Everyone\u2019s a celebrity when the pope comes to town. The papal motorcade arrives for the parade. That\u2019s a lot of vehicles. Pope Francis and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York climb into the popemobile. Jessica Glenza met Pope Francis on the tarmac earlier: Pope Francis disembarked at John F Kennedy airport to a crowd of roughly 200 parishioners from nearby churches, homeless from Catholic shelters, the infirm and children. The first to receive a kiss on the forehead from Pope Francis \u2013 far and above what he expected \u2013 was Gerard Gubatan, a 27-year-old man with cerebral palsy who was brought to the tarmac by EMTs. \u201cI was frozen, he was elated, I was speechless, and all I could do was just grab his hand and kiss it,\u201d said his mother Iluminada Gubatan. Gerard is largely mute, but beamed as he was moved away from the crowds on the tarmac after Francis left. Asked how it was, he yelled \u201cGood!\u201d over the roar of helicopter and bus engines. This is cool: a fire boat gives the pope a salute as his helicopter touched down in New York. Clever. Inside St Patrick\u2019s, those who have been waiting for hours have just finished praying the Rosary, a traditional Catholic prayer to the Virgin Mary. Amanda Holpuch is on Fifth Avenue talking to fans of the pope: Out of all the popes who\u2019ve been, he\u2019s the best,\u201d said Jennifer Martinez, who had just said goodbye to her mom, one of the few to get a ticket for a seat inside St Patrick\u2019s. Martinez planned to stick around the area with her cousin and each of their children to hopefully get a glimpse of Francis. She\u2019s happy that the pontiff has spoken so strongly about he need for immigration reform. \u201cI think his words have validation,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey help a lot.\u201d Teresa Skroly is also a fan of Francis\u2019s open communication style. She has met popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, but was still excited to see Francis from Fifth Avenue. \u201cEven though I loved both of them I think he is a breath of fresh air,\u201d she said. The Donald is also keeping an eye out for the pope. The crowds and media anxiously wait for the pope to arrive at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Here\u2019s some video from earlier: Speaker John Boehner was overcome by emotion earlier today when the pope spoke to thousands on the National Mall in Washington DC. That was quick. The pope disembarks from the helicopter and piles straight into an identical papal Fiat. Now he\u2019s off to St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral for evening prayer. While we\u2019re waiting for Pope Francis\u2019s armada to touch down in New York, here\u2019s a gallery from Time Magazine of all the popes who have graced their front page, starting with Pius XI in 1924. I shall call him ... mini-pope. Play these two together for that papal air force vibe. Meanwhile, at the pope\u2019s destination ... (this is actually NY Senator Chuck Schumer, not Mayor De Blasio. It\u2019s not like the Vatican is where the infallible people live or anything). And he\u2019s off. You can see his whole New York itinerary, and the rest of the tour, here: The pope is hustled into a waiting helicopter by Marines. He\u2019ll fly to a Wall Street helipad, commentators on the US Conference of Catholic Bishops live stream say. New York, New York! The pope is greeted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 the Apostolic Nuncio to the US, and \u2013 it\u2019s Pope Francis, after all \u2013 some schoolchildren. It\u2019s windy out there. Amid chants of \u201cWelcome to New York!\u201d the pope goes to say hello to the families gathered behind the barrier. Bishops on the tarmac, cassocks flapping around all over the place. And here\u2019s the view from inside Shepherd One: Action stations! The pope has touched down in New York at John F Kennedy airport. And here\u2019s some detail on \u201cShepherd One\u201d, the American Airlines flight Pope Francis has chartered for his US tour. The papal seal will also be affixed to the side of the aircraft, the only major modification that\u2019s planned. However, the flight number will be blocked per a Secret Service request, so the public won\u2019t be able to track its progress. Read the rest at CNN here. The pope should touch down in New York any minute now. Jessica Glenza is on the tarmac for his arrival: In the crowd is a four-year-old boy who needs a liver transplant, a man with recurring non-Hodgkins lymphoma, sisters and residents of nursing homes \u2013 all anxiously awaiting Pope Francis\u2019s arrival. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed, the word is overwhelmed,\u201d said Anna Ambrosino, a \u201cjust\u201d 89-year-old nursing home resident from Bay Ridge, Queens. \u201cWhen sister first told me, my sister, I cried my eyes out.\u201d Sister Sheila Ann Therese, who works at Little Sisters of the Poor in Queens Village, said she felt the Pope\u2019s speech earlier Thursday to Congress, \u201cwas very dynamic.\u201d \u201cHe said what needed to be said.\u201d Harriet Sherwood, at St Patrick\u2019s: Ticket-holders were being admitted to the beautiful St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral almost four hours before the pope is due to celebrate mass, with a large contingent of priests and nuns at the head of the queue. People had begun lining Fifth Avenue in anticipation of Francis\u2019s arrival. A very large group wearing green t-shirts emblazoned with \u201cLove is our Mission\u201d threaded their way through shoppers on Madison Avenue, heading towards the cathedral. There were quite a few raised voices from non-Pope watchers, irritated to find roads blocked. They may as well get used to it: the pope\u2019s visit only lasts around 40 hours but this bit of New York is facing days of gridlock as world leaders descend for the United Nations general assembly. There are some fantastic gifs coming out of this trip. What a gift to the world. The Guardian\u2019s \u201cloose canon\u201d Giles Fraser has written for Comment is Free about Pope Francis\u2019s citation of Dorothy Day and his stance on abortion. That the pope would celebrate her in Congress is an exciting moment for leftwing Christians. Fraser notes that it\u2019s hard for the secular left to understand Francis entirely. His piece is well worth reading: And from my colleagues Harriet Sherwood and Ed Pilkington: while Francis made no specific mention of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, his brand of xenophobia is squarely in the pope\u2019s crosshairs. Check out this excellent Guardian interactive to compare statements on immigration from Pope Francis and Donald Trump: Pope Francis departs Washington DC en route to New York. From our Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner: Fox news analyst Tamara Holder with a short video of the NYC security. Guardian religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood checks in: There\u2019s a massive police presence around the house in which Pope Francis is staying for the next two nights, with road closures for at least two blocks on either side. It\u2019s a handsome five-storey building, owned by the Holy See, and is the residence of Archbishop Bernadito Auza, the Vatican\u2019s observer at the United Nations. It\u2019s huge \u2013 around 11,000 square feet, and containing a private chapel \u2013 with an estimated value of more than $20m. Shops and restaurants in the surrounding streets have seen a sharp drop in business as a result of the closures. In Rosi, an Italian restaurant close to the papal residence, there was just a handful of diners at lunchtime. \u201cTake-outs are up,\u201d said Ben Lewis from behind the counter, because of the heavy police presence. \u201cBut sit-downs are way lower than usual.\u201d Describing himself as \u201cnot a Catholic but a Christian\u201d, Lewis said he was very happy to see the pope in town. \u201cHe brings people together in unity.\u201d Pope Francis isn\u2019t far away. When he arrives, he\u2019ll head to St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral for evening prayer. The cathedral was being restored even a few days ago \u2013 when I visited on Sunday there was plenty of drilling and painting still going on. Now it\u2019s free from scaffolding after its three-year, $177m restoration. Read more about the restoration here. With Angela Bruno in NYC. New York doesn\u2019t need Francis when it already has Pope Francesca, according to one bloke on Twitter: Writing for Comment is Free, Julio Ricardo Varela says Pope Francis\u2019s visit has been a welcome change for US Latinos feeling beaten down by recent bouts of xenophobia: From Angela Bruno: Kim Kardashian\u2019s \u201cThe pope is dope\u201d tweet, or tuit as it\u2019s spelled in Spanish, caught the attention of a reporter at Primicias Ya, an Argentinian entertainment news site. Unfortunately, and hilariously, the true meaning was lost in translation for the reporter who seems to only be familiar with dope\u2019s other meaning. He translates the tweet as: \u201cTHE POPE IS DRUGS,\u201d accusing Kim of attacking the Pope. Pondering the hidden meaning of her \u201ccurious\u201d tweet, the writer concludes by asking readers: What could Kim be referring to? Without a doubt, this couldn\u2019t be positive. How do you interpret her message? Luckily, there is no byline on the story, and commenters on the post have been quick to share dope\u2019s more positive connotations with the writer. Read the full piece, in Spanish, here. Jim Nicholson, former ambassador to the Holy See, is now working for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign. He has issued a statement on the pope\u2019s address. Nicholson was Republican National Committee chairman between 1997-2001 and was recently announced as a co-chair of \u201cCatholics for Jeb\u201d. His statement very politely disagrees with the pontiff: When the Holy Father has the chance to visit Philadelphia and New York, I hope he will continue to see first-hand how a free people living in a market-based economy have produced the most good for the most people in the history of the world. Our country and our people are not perfect, but this American experiment of a government of the people, by the people and for the people serves as a beacon for freedom throughout the world. During his time in D.C., the Pope did not hesitate to urge Americans to be proper stewards of God\u2019s creation. We can disagree about some of the particulars, but we cannot deny the need to be responsible in this regard. Hopefully Pope Francis will include a message about our obligation to protect the rights of the unborn and the importance of traditional families when he participates in the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The innocent unborn and young children need his unequivocal embrace more now than ever. Rep Luis V Guti\u00e9rrez (D-IL) has put out a statement on the pope. There were some strong lines in there, especially on immigration and Donald Trump: I try to push back on Donald Trump and others who attack Latinos and immigrants or women or Muslims or the poor \u2013 sometimes on the floor of the House. But I cannot speak as simply and as powerfully as the Pope can. Today, someone stood up for the people in my community and the message will definitely sink in. I think every Member of Congress will have to think twice before calling all immigrants drug mules or denying climate change or cutting help for working families or labeling children seeking asylum as criminals. If Congress had a daily reminder of the Golden Rule, this would be a better country. From Jessica Glenzer at JFK airport in New York: A mother and daughter from the Bronx attempted to see Pope Francis without tickets to today\u2019s events, and made it as far as the Port Authority administration building before they were turned away by diocesan security. The pair took the Air Train to John F Kennedy airport in an attempt to do so. Monsignor Kieren Herrington said he would attempt to have the pair attend another papal event. The conservative Catholic reaction to Pope Francis\u2019s speech to Congress has been mixed and quite critical. They have a few main problems: The pope didn\u2019t define \u201cthe family\u201d, even as he said it was threatened from within and without. He didn\u2019t sufficiently condemn abortion, with the influential traditionalist blog Rorate Caeli tweeting this: He didn\u2019t mention Jesus Christ or pray. And he didn\u2019t raise a cry for persecuted Christians in the Middle East. It\u2019s a common conservative talking point that he has chosen environmentalism as his cause rather than Islam and Christian persecution. I won\u2019t deal with all these here. It\u2019s worth mentioning though that, on the family, the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia is already producing some big statements of which the pope will be aware. It\u2019s attracting very little interest outside Catholic media but figures who would be considered superstars in the Catholic world have spoken very strongly for a totally orthodox view of the family at the Philly conference. Cardinal Robert Sarah, from Guinea, gave a keynote speech yesterday that was unequivocal: \u201cEven members of the Church can be tempted to soften Christ\u2019s teaching on marriage and the family,\u201d he said. \u201cTo varying degrees, the idea would consist in placing the Magisterium [the teachings of Christ and the church] in a pretty box and separating it from pastoral practice, which could evolve according to such circumstances, fashions and emphases.\u201d This was \u201ca form of heresy\u201d and \u201ca dangerous, schizophrenic pathology\u201d and was, Sarah said, \u201cprecisely why we need Christ\u201d. It\u2019s difficult to gauge the reception of Sarah\u2019s keynote, but the Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, tweeted this: So I\u2019d speculate that Francis is reticent to speak strongly around family issues because, while on the surface the church seems rock solid in its teachings, underneath things are much more febrile. He will not want to seem to be at odds with senior members of his own Curia any more than he already is. Some further detail: Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, the prefect of the powerful Congregation for the Doctine of the Faith (once upon a time the Inquisition) launched a translation of Sarah\u2019s new book earlier this month. Sarah is the prefect for the Congregation for Divine Worship. Between the two of them, they wield an enormous amount of influence. Mueller had this to say at the launch: It is, in the eyes of Cardinal Sarah, destructive for the Church when she exposes herself to the political and social media struggle for power ... When man in his bodily, spiritual, and intellectual being is merely the product of an ideological construct ... any morality will thereby be deprived of a foundation. It\u2019s hard not to see this as a criticism of Pope Francis, who is at home on social media, giving interviews to the press, and has involved himself to varying degrees in political struggles over Cuba, Colombia and climate change, among others. Mueller also warned of a new schism in his speech. Francis will be treading carefully when he gets to Philly at the end of the week. The only endorsement the pope needs. Donald Trump spoke to CNN about the speech to congress just now. While he respects the pope, Trump\u2019s not on board with Francis\u2019s stances on climate change or migration, as you might imagine. Trump reiterated that he would build a wall along the US border with a \u201cbig open gate\u201d for migrants to enter legally. His policy on deportations: whole family groups, and \u201cthe bad ones go and never come back\u201d. He still doesn\u2019t think climate change is real, he told CNN, adding \u201cI\u2019ve won many environmental awards\u201d. More politicians crying during the pope\u2019s speech to Congress, via Vanity Fair: Here\u2019s a short clip of Pope Francis blessing the crowd at the National Mall in Washington DC. When he cuts into English at the end to say \u201cGod Bless America\u201d the smile on his face is very infectious. Another endorsement, this time from Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton: Amanda Holpuch is waiting with anxious Pope Francis Fans on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue: Hundreds of people have already lined-up on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, outside St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. After passing through an intensive screening process, ticket holders are let inside an area with a fence around 8-feet-tall. Dexis Almomte arrived at 8am to ensure she got a good view of the procession. Security told her she was early so she came back at noon and managed to get a prime position directly across from the Cathedral. \u201cPeople camp out early for a new phone, so I was ready to for the Pope,\u201d said Almomte, who teaches Catechism in Brooklyn. Maria Dasilva came from central New Jersey with her mother, godmother and cousin. While waiting to go through security, she explained that she became a fan of Pope Francis when he stepped out on the Vatican balcony for the first time after being chosen as Pope and asked Catholics to pray for him. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a glimpse, I\u2019d love that. I\u2019m getting goosebumps just telling you,\u201d said Dasilva (pictured below second from the left, wearing sunglasses). My colleague Lauren Gambino reported yesterday on Sophie Cruz, the 5-year-old girl who hand delivered Pope Francis a letter urging immigration reform. Today she met Democrat Representative Tony C\u00e1rdenas after the pope\u2019s address to Congress: Kerry Washington, who plays Olivia Pope on Scandal, has spoken of her admiration for the pope: \u201cI think he\u2019s so special. I think he\u2019s so humble and so focused on service \u2013 just really focused on doing good in the world. Not being judgmental. Letting God be the judge,\u201d she told Live! with Kelly and Michael. via Vanity Fair. Speaker John Boehner gets emotional. White House spokesman Josh Earnest has told reporters President Obama managed to see \u201cat least part of Pope Francis\u2019s remarks to Congress\u201d but was unaware of his \u201cspecific reaction\u201d to the speech. \u201cI know that he would have been struck by the kind of message that Francis had to deliver not just to the leaders of this country but to the citizens of this country,\u201d Earnest said, praising Francis\u2019s call for Americans to meet \u201cthe high standard that we\u2019ve set for ourselves\u201d. He also downplayed worries that the pope\u2019s visit has overshadowed the visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping. \u201cI have not heard anyone raise that concern. I think the sense is that this is a week that we have long identified as being one filled with a lot of intensive diplomacy,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cIn each of those meetings the president will be considering how the US can continue to use our international influence to advance our interests around the globe ... even on those issues that might be characterized by what you could describe as \u2018competition\u2019.\u201d Top Vaticanista John L Allen Jr has posted on Crux about the pope\u2019s \u201cFantastic Four\u201d \u2013 Abraham Lincoln, Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton and Martin Luther King Jr. He\u2019s always worth reading. Here\u2019s the highlights: Poverty and War: The emphasis on Day and Merton confirms that in the galaxy of issues of concern to this pope ... poverty and war have a pride of place. For Day, it was the dignity of the poor, expressed most famously in founding the Catholic Worker Movement along with Peter Maurin. For Merton, it was peace, with his letters and diaries chronicling his deep concern with violence, including the Vietnam War and the proliferation of nuclear arms. Political Instincts: In the run-up to his visit to the United States, there has been a lot of talk about whether or not Francis is in some sense \u201canti-American,\u201d or whether his vision is irreconcilable with American values. This morning, Francis indirectly answered the question of whether he\u2019s anti-American by saying, in essence, \u201cWell, if I am, so are these four American heroes.\u201d Canonization for Dorothy Day? This morning\u2019s speech was probably good news for the canonization cause of Dorothy Day ... While there\u2019s no indication that Francis plans to fast-track the cause, it certainly can\u2019t hurt that he used the first-ever address by a pope to the US Congress to give her a plug. Francis wants to learn from the US: Francis could have directed the gaze of Congress to great figures from his own cultural experience, such as Sim\u00f2n Bolivar or, or any number of popes. Instead he chose Americans, which was a way of saying that he realizes he doesn\u2019t just have something to teach the United States \u2013 he, and the rest of the world, can learn from it as well. Pope Francis is still hours away from New York, but Jessica Glenza is on site at JFK airport with those waiting for the pontiff to arrive: A group of five students from Brooklyn and Queens Catholic schools will hand Pope Francis a \u201cspiritual bouquet\u201d upon his arrival at John F Kennedy airport in New York City in a chartered American Airlines Boeing 777, at \u201cabout\u201d 5pm. The others expected to greet the pope make his arrival a relatively small affair \u2013 just 200 members of Catholic churches and other services from around the city are invited, along with a band from Xaverian high school in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and a mass of a few dozen reporters. Members of the group of 200 will include parishioners, some of the 26 ethnic groups that makeup congregations in Brooklyn, nursing home residents and homeless people living in religious housing. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Brooklyn said the members will pray the rosary while they wait for the Pope to arrive. The Xaverian high school band will play New York, New York by Frank Sinatra, then City of God as the Pope gets off the plane. The entire ceremony is expected to last 15 minutes. Pope Francis\u2019s message of compassion and humanity resonated with Miami\u2019s sizeable immigrant community, which has become frustrated with stalled efforts in Congress for comprehensive immigration reform, reports Richard Luscombe in Miami. Viewing immigrants as people, \u201cseeing their faces and listening to their stories\u201d, as the pope urged Washington legislators, struck a particular chord with Marcia Olivo, who came to the US from the Dominican Republic two decades ago, as she watched the address. \u201cThe pope has been very vocal and shown a lot of compassion, he\u2019s speaking about lowering the borders for immigrants, without tagging people with this label,\u201d she said. \u201cHe sees them as human beings. He is bringing an important message and the most important thing is that Congress listened to him and paid attention to what he said. What I hope will prevail is compassion and dignity for people. It\u2019s time to be able to come out of the shadows and to live without fear.\u201d Olivo is no stranger to the immigration issue, and in her job at the Miami Workers Centre, a social advocacy group, she encounters the frustrations experienced by Florida\u2019s estimated 900.000 undocumented immigrants on a daily basis. Watching the pope\u2019s address on television at the workers\u2019 centre in Liberty City, the heart of Miami\u2019s multi-cultural community, Olivo was pleased with his call for the US to welcome migrants seeking refuge and not be \u201ctaken aback by their numbers\u201d. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about families we need to be talking about the separation of families and resolving that problem,\u201d she said, referring to President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive action to halt the deportation of illegal immigrant parents whose children were born in the US and therefore citizens. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents has been held up by the Republican-controlled legislature and a courtroom power struggle between the Obama administration and judiciary and its future is uncertain. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 3.7 million undocumented immigrants in the US who could be eligible to stay under DAPA. \u201cIt was good to see politicians standing and clapping the pope but they need to take his message to heart,\u201d she said. \u201cA good outcome of the would be Congress putting politics aside and bringing humanity to the forefront. I hope having the pope there isn\u2019t just a trend and they open their hearts to the message he is bringing.\u201d A number of activists from Miami took part in a 100-mile walk from Pennsylvania to Washington DC to greet the pope and call for immigration reform. Olivo walked several days with them and said the group arrived back in Miami on Wednesday with \u201csore feet but a sense of accomplishment.\u201d Guardian US political reporter Ben Jacobs has been roving the galleries in Congress, catching current representatives and would-be future presidents of the United States for their thoughts on the pope\u2019s speech. You\u2019d think that someone like the Republican candidate and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, surrounded by controversy for saying he did not want a Muslim president, might double down. He kind of did, just not on that, as Ben reports: It sounded good. It sounded like he was talking about things that are generally uplifting: life, environment \u2013 things that anyone should be able to agree with. I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying about climate change. I certainly agree that any intelligent person will try to take care of the environment \u2013 not just for themselves, for others. As far as the death penalty was concerned, I think that\u2019s a civil issue and as such I think the people in the region should make their own decisions. We\u2019re a country of immigrants. We\u2019ve always accepted immigrants, but obviously we have to be careful the way we do. I think it\u2019s very reasonable because, really, he\u2019s talking about things which hopefully transcend partisanship \u2013 things we should all be thinking about. And then there\u2019s Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and candidate for president, brushing off the in-your-face immigration talk that was the thrust of the pope\u2019s address with the words \u201cradical Islam\u201d ... and instead focusing on the abortion language at the end, as Ben reports: There is no nation on Earth that is more welcoming than the United States of America. That is entirely consistent with believing in the rule of law \u2013 that we should secure the border and we should know who is coming into the country, particularly at the time with rise of radical Islam and growing national security threats. We can remain a nation that welcomes legal immigrants while at the same time as securing our border and protecting safety of legal Americans. I think the proposition that we should welcome legal immigrants is absolutely correct and is also consistent with over two centuries of our nation\u2019s history. Well, his admonition to Congress that we should protect human life at every stage of development was powerful \u2013 all the more so in the wake of Senate Democrats standing almost entirely united in support of late-term abortion. It was striking and heartbreaking to see so many Congressional Democrats sitting stone-faced, arms-crossed, when the pope urged all to defend human life \u2013 the first and most fundamental right and obligation. Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for life at a time when life is profoundly threatened in America. Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for marriage in a time when five unelected judges are seeking to tear down marriage laws across the country. And Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for religious liberty at a time when the Obama administration is waging a relentless war against religious liberty. So there\u2019s that. From Angela Bruno: In his address to Congress this morning, the pope mentioned four \u201cgreat Americans\u201d. Two are household names: Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. The other two are lesser-known: Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton. Google trends noted a spike in searches for the latter two. Some commentators have noted that the pope left out some lines from his prepared text. The enigmatic Fr Federico Lombardi corrects the record: Speaking to CNN after the pope\u2019s address to Congress, Senator Bernie Sanders said his honoring of former socialist and Catholic convert Dorothy Day showed his priorities. \u201cShe was a very, very progressive socialist who organised working people and the poor to stand up to the wealthy and powerful, for social justice,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe fact that he cited her ... as one of the people he appreciated, tells you exactly where this man is coming from.\u201d Day was the founder of the Great Depression-era Catholic Worker newspaper and houses of hospitality and a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Her personal life is considered unorthodox by Catholic standards: she had an abortion and lived for years in a common-law marriage. Nonetheless, many people advocate for her canonization. Sanders also remarked on the non-partisan tone of the pontiff\u2019s address, saying \u201che handled himself in a very dignified way\u201d. \u201cHe was an invited guest and wasn\u2019t here to make partisan points,\u201d Sanders said, adding that while he disagreed with the church\u2019s stance on abortion and gay marriage, he and other progressives were \u201cthere to listen to a very good man\u201d. Our intrepid reporter Jessica Glenza has spent the morning traversing the security to welcome Pope Francis at New York\u2019s JFK airport. Security is tight; it was only yesterday that a Guardian reporter had his banana confiscated before the Junipero Serra canonization. Here\u2019s more on the security challenges from my colleague Mahita Gajanan: Because the pope\u2019s visit coincides with the 70th United Nations General Assembly, which brings in about 170 world leaders, New York faces a large security challenge. NYPD commissioner William Bratton said last week that the pope\u2019s hands-on style presents its own security challenges \u2013 Pope Francis plans to visit an East Harlem school and lead a procession through Central Park. \u201cWe are very confident we will have a safe event for all those coming,\u201d Bratton said. The US Department of Homeland Security designated the papal visit as a national special security event, so the US Secret Service has assumed its role as the lead federal agency for the security plan. The Secret Service Is working with the NYPD, the FBI, the US Coast Guard and several other local and national departments to operate security. Thousands of police officers have been assigned to each event of the papal visit, as well as the events at the UN. People attending the events are prohibited from bringing balloons, umbrellas and selfie sticks, among several other items. How\u2019s that for a contrast: the papal Fiat v the armored personnel carriers driven by his security forces. The pope has departed his meal with the homeless. Next stop: New York City. From Angela Bruno: From blocks away, Univision correspondent Fernando Pizarro captures the roar of the crowd as the Pope exited the Capitol Building after his joint address to Congress. Once outside, the Pope issued an impromptu greeting to the crowd and addressed the masses in Spanish, thanking them for their presence, and asking for their prayers. He extended his message to everyone, going on to say, \u201cIf there are among you any who do not believe or cannot pray, I ask you please to send good wishes my way.\u201d The \u201chomeless problem\u201d, according to president of the Catholic league Bill Donohue, is not just \u201ca function of a lack of housing\u201d, he told Catholic TV network EWTN. It was also because of mental illness that they weren\u2019t in shelter, which, Donohue said, was partly the blame of civil libertarians. Donohue is a long-time critic of civil libertarians, and the author of a critical book on the ACLU. G\u2019day, Adam Brereton back with you on the blog now after a marathon morning from my colleague Nicky Woolf. The pope is currently meeting homeless Americans in Washington DC. From Angela Bruno in NYC: Rocco Palma, chief chronicler of the Roman Catholic Church, has this to say about the pope\u2019s address to the people on the steps of the Capitol building. Pope Francis is the first Latin American pontiff, and the first whose native language is Spanish. Immigration reform, a cause close to the hearts of many in the Latino community, has been at the center of the pope\u2019s messages this week. My colleague Sibylla Brodzinksy in Bogot\u00e1 has an update on another aspect of papal diplomacy: the Vatican\u2019s involvement in Colombia\u2019s peace process. Before arriving in the US the pope stopped off in Cuba, which last night was the setting for another historic event: the announcement that Colombia\u2019s five-decade war may finally be coming to an end. Representatives of the country\u2019s government and the Farc rebels said that after nearly three years of talks, they had reached a groundbreaking deal on justice, paving the way for a final peace deal within six months. There\u2019s probably nothing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colomabia and the country\u2019s government would have liked better than to have announced the agreement while Pope Francis was in Havana. Colombian media speculated that the two parties had wanted the pope to be present at last night\u2019s announcement. Sources close to the talks denied that, but Francis may nonetheless have played a role in the breakthrough. The rebels declared their first ever indefinite ceasefire in December - on the same day that Cuba and the US announced their historic rapprochement, which was in part brokered by the Vatican. During his mass in Havana\u2019s Revolution Plaza on Sunday the pope beseeched the two sides to end the war that has claimed at least 200,000 lives. \u201cWe do not have the right to allow ourselves yet another failure,\u201d he said of the latest attempt to end the conflict. A day later, the Farc responded with a video message to the pope saying that there were \u201cpowerful reasons for hope\u201d that a peace deal was on the near horizon. By Tuesday, the deal was cooked and top rebel leader Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, alias Timochenko, and President Juan Manuel Santos were on their way to Havana to preside over the signing of the pact Wednesday evening. Without alluding to the Colombian deal specifically, the pope told the US Congress: \u201cBeing at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world.\u201d Pope Francis concludes his remarks at St. Patrick\u2019s: Prayer unites us; it makes us brothers and sisters. It opens our hearts and reminds us of a beautiful truth which we sometimes forget. In prayer, we all learn to say \u201cFather\u201d, \u201cDad\u201d. We learn to see one another as brothers and sisters. In prayer, there are no rich and poor people, there are sons and daughters, sisters and brothers. In prayer, there is no first or second class, there is brotherhood. It is in prayer that our hearts find the strength not to be cold and insensitive in the face of injustice. In prayer, God keeps calling us, opening our hearts to charity. How good it is for us to pray together. How good it is to encounter one another in this place where we see one another as brothers and sisters, where we realize that we need one another. Today I want to be one with you. He ends on the Lord\u2019s prayer: The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace. \u201cAnd please, don\u2019t forget to pray for me,\u201d he says. We know that Jesus wanted to show solidarity with every person. He wanted everyone to experience his companionship, his help, his love. He identified with all those who suffer, who weep, who suffer any kind of injustice. In this speech, Pope Francis is laying out the theological case for his own positions on social injustice. In the face of unjust and painful situations, faith brings us the light which scatters the darkness. As it did for Joseph, faith makes us open to the quiet presence of God at every moment of our lives, in every person and in every situation. God is present in every one of you, in each one of us. I want to be very clear. We can find no social or moral justification, no justification whatsoever, for lack of housing. There are many unjust situations, but we know that God is suffering with us, experiencing them at our side. He does not abandon us. Like Saint Joseph, you may ask: Why are we homeless, without a place to live? These are questions which all of us might well ask. Why do these, our brothers and sisters, have no place to live? Why are these brothers and sisters of ours homeless? Joseph\u2019s questions are timely even today; they accompany all those who throughout history have been, and are, homeless. Pope Francis is speaking at St. Patrick in the City church. He talks about helping the homeless: I can imagine Joseph, with his wife about to have a child, with no shelter, no home, no place to stay. The Son of God came into this world as a homeless person. The Son of God knew what it was to start life without a roof over his head. We can imagine what Joseph must have been thinking. How is it that the Son of God has no home? Why are we homeless, why don\u2019t we have housing? These are questions which many of you may ask daily. Lauren Gambino is talking to people in the crowd at the Capitol. There was a notable omission in the pope\u2019s speech before Congress, reports Stephanie Kirchgaessner. According to the prepared text, Pope Francis was to issue a powerful commentary on how politicians can be led astray, saying that \u201cIf politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance.\u201d But Francis left out those words, which would have been particularly stinging before a group of lawmakers - Democrats and Republicans alike - who raise hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate interests, particularly banks, to finance their campaigns. Furthermore, the failure to act on global warming, or finance various social programs that benefit the poor, are often excused for economic reasons. Reasons the pope clearly would not agree with - though he stopped short of making that point today. Here is the full section of the text that was omitted from the speech. Here I think of the political history of the United States, where democracy is deeply rooted in the mind of the American people. All political activity must serve and promote the good of the human person and be based on respect for his or her dignity. \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d (Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776). If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Pope Francis has returned to his Fiat to leave the Capitol Building, on his way to visit the church of St. Patrick in the City. Looks like Senator Tim Scott broke the no-photos in the chamber rule, posting this picture of Pope Francis speaking: The dominant theme of the pope\u2019s address to Congress was certainly immigration. He spoke of \u201cthousands of persons [who] are led to travel north in search of a better life\u201d \u2013 here in North America, but also with a reference to the European migration crisis. Here to make sense of the Francis message on immigration from both sides of the Atlantic are Guardian religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood and Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington: Ed Pilkington: We expected Pope Francis to deliver strong words on immigration, but if I were Donald Trump I\u2019d be quaking in my boots. The frontrunner Republican presidential candidate wasn\u2019t mentioned by name, of course, but he was certainly present in the passage the pontiff reserved on the subject. It was devastating. Francis got one of the biggest cheers of the speech with this line: \u201cWe are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners.\u201d He called on Congress to reject a \u201cmindset of hostility\u201d. Then he referred to the thousands of people travelling north from Central America and Mexico to enter the US not in terms of rape and murder as Trump has chosen to do, but as epitomes of the American Dream \u2013 people like so many in the US who have come here in search of a better life. \u201cIs this not what we want for our own children?\u201d is a phrase that will continue to resonate in the fevered presidential debate for some time to come. Harriet Sherwood: And he referred again \u2013 as he did at the White House on Wednesday \u2013 to his own family background: \u201cI say this to you as the son of immigrants.\u201d Those were practically his first public words on US soil, so his message couldn\u2019t be more clear. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about the US track record on immigration. He\u2019s also talking about a global crisis: \u201cOur world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War.\u201d That\u2019s referring to the hundreds of thousands of people trudging across Europe in search of a better life. So David Cameron and the rest of the UK government should listen up, too. Ed Pilkington: Absolutely. And this is a message that will resonate in the US as well, where leaders of both main parties have so far been hesitant to make firm commitments about taking more Syrian refugees. We asked the presidential candidates recently what they would do to help solve the Syrian refugee crisis and were met with an almost universal evasion. Harriet Sherwood: Yes, both the US and the UK have been put to shame by the response of the German government which has opened its doors to refugees. But, in a characteristic move, Pope Francis has also called for every Catholic parish to take in a refugee family, and indeed is hosting one in the Vatican. That was a very practical action, and consistent with his papacy. It\u2019s interesting to wonder if history might have taken a different course if every Catholic parish had taken in a Jewish family in 1938. Ed Pilkington: I\u2019m struck by how effortlessly Francis moved in his speech from the very practical, as you say, to evoking the finer spirit in humanity. He evoked Moses, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King. In that tradition, he called on Congress to \u201cavoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome\u201d. I couldn\u2019t help thinking at that point of the wall Trump wants to build along the US border with Mexico and his talk of mass deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Harriet Sherwood: Indeed. And it\u2019s really significant that he is clear that we should open our doors not just to those fleeing war and persecution, but what are often termed \u2018economic migrants\u2019. These are people in search of greater opportunities, Francis said. \u201cIs this not what we want for our own children?\u201d And: \u201cLet us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves.\u201d These are strong words and clear guidance from the Holy Father, and our political leaders should be shifting uncomfortably in their seats. The view of the crowd from behind Pope Francis as he reached out to atheists to \u201csend good wishes my way.\u201d He concludes in English: Thank you very much, and God bless America. \u201cThe most important ones here are children.\u201d He prays; blessing \u201ceach of them\u201d and their families. \u201cBless them all.\u201d And I ask you all please to pray for me. And if there are among you any who do not believe or who cannot pray, I ask you please to send good wishes my way. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for your presence here,\u201d he says, speaking in Spanish with translation into English. As the pope walks through the Statuary Hall, he cannot fail to see the statue of controversial priest Juni\u0301pero Serra. Yesterday, the pope officiated a canonization mass for Serra, who presided over an era in California when the native American population were \u201cbrutalized \u2013 beaten, pressed into forced labour and infected with diseases to which they had no resistance,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Gumbel reported on Wednesday. It appears Pope Francis is aware of the controversy surrounding Serra\u2019s canonization, because he addressed it directly in his speech: Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. He defended Serra\u2019s canonization, however: Those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, but it is difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. And then called for unity: We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our \u201cneighbors\u201d and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. A hushed crowd watches the pope\u2019s address: The Pope\u2019s speech lasted 50 minutes (it was scheduled to last 30). There was a total of one minute\u2019s applause during the address. One of the most interesting moments of the speech was when Francis spoke about ideological extremism. Spencer Ackerman had this to say: At a moment when a band of millenarian fanatics declare themselves to be the \u201cIslamic State\u201d, and when a boy who brings a clock into school gets arrested on suspicion he has a bomb because of his religion, Pope Francis tells Congress that \u201cno religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism.\u201d Francis\u2019s message, to guard against \u201cthe simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil\u201d, is not one of equivocation or equivalence, as he speaks specifically about \u201ccombat[ting] violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology or an economic system\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s a call for more maturity: \u201cWe know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within.\u201d The value of a spiritual leader on the world stage is to prompt the powerful into introspection. Here is Francis telling a Congress, and a country, that is acting like Muslim lives are cheaper than Christian and Jewish ones, that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject.\u201d The response to Francis falls to the presidential candidates demonizing Muslims, the legislators and presidential aides content to keep detaining men indefinitely without charge, the president with a Nobel peace prize who proliferates what he euphemistically calls \u201ctargeted killing\u201d, and the voters content with all this. If Francis\u2019s speech is to be met with more than empty and ritualistic applause, they - we - must all ask: do we actually reject it? Pope Francis will now walk through Statuary Hall in the Capitol Building. US opinion editor Megan Carpentier weighs in on abortion \u2013 specifically, that difficult-to-decipher moment at the end there about \u201ca culture which pressures young people not to start a family\u201d. Though the pope earlier this year ordered priests to offer absolution to women who had abortions but repented their actions, he was unequivocal in his opposition to abortion during his speech to Congress, telling the assembled members, to near-rapturous applause, \u201cThe Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development.\u201d (His reminder that the responsibility to protect and defend human life also extends to opposing the death penalty was, unsurprisingly, less well-received.) But it was nearer to the end of the speech that he reminded his listeners, however obtusely, that the Church\u2019s opposition to reproductive rights, including birth control, has its roots in the faith\u2019s understanding of \u201cfamily\u201d and women\u2019s role in it. \u2018It is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support and encouragement! Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. \u2018In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable, the young. For many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse and despair. Their problem are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family.\u2019 Though the pope is also addressing the Church\u2019s concern with same sex marriage, he\u2019s also alluding to the fact that the Church conceives of motherhood as women\u2019s most important role in the world, though he supports equal pay for those who have to work. But it\u2019s interesting that he focuses on the intersection of economic insecurity and fertility rates as much as economic possibility (and \u2018choice\u2019) as a factor in people\u2019s choices on whether to start families. But the focus on \u2018family\u2019 here was really a focus on women, and women\u2019s rights, as much as it was a reference to marriage equality, and a call for women to reconsider what the Church believes to be their fundamental role as mother\u2019s and protectors of the family. In these remarks I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. He ends: \u201cGod bless America!\u201d \u201cIn particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable, the young,\u201d he continues. \u201cFor many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse and despair.\u201d Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family. Culture-wars conservatives will like this, a little. But it is still non-specific enough as to not threaten the Left. Francis says that he will end his visit to the US in Philadelphia, where he will take part in the World Meeting of Families. \u201cIt is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme,\u201d he says. How essential the family has been to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support and encouragement! Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. This is a section which could be read as throwing a bone in the direction of the Christian right on same-sex marriage - though, in contrast to the directness with which Pope Francis addressed the arms trade, the reference is oblique. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. More from Dan Roberts, in the Capitol Building: The speech is having a remarkable effect on lawmakers as Democrats repeatedly lead Republicans in standing ovations when the Pope enlists moral arguments to support liberal positions. On at least four occasions, the floor of the House of Representatives resembled a Mexican wave as Republicans at first resisted the encouragement to applause but decided to stand once it was clear that Democrats were doing so. This was most apparent when Pope Francis quoted from the bible in urging them to do \u201cunto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d. The line was used to support his call for immigration reform, but it must have been hard for many Christian Republicans to risk sitting down during a quote from the scripture. From his tacit praise of Obama\u2019s diplomatic efforts - which will likely not make him friends among conservative hawks - Francis turns to the arms trade. \u201cBeing at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world,\u201d he says. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Here, as before, he does not mince words. Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. The speech is not getting much love from Rorate Caeli, a conservative Catholic blog, which tweeted out its dissatisfaction that abortion had been \u201cglossed over\u201d. Turning obliquely to diplomacy, Francis uses his fourth human example: Thomas Merton. A Cistertian monk, mystic and poet, Merton belonged to an order of Trappists in Kentucky. Originally born in France, he was a keen proponent of social justice, spirituality, and pacifism, and a prolific writer and essayist who pushed dialogue with Buddhist and Taoist figures and advanced the cause of interfaith understanding. His most famous work is the Seven-Storey Mountain. The pope quotes from Merton\u2019s autobiography: I came into the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness From his example, the pope said he wished to appreciate \u201cthe efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past\u201d. He may be alluding to the Iran nuclear deal, or rapprochement with Cuba \u2013 in which he was directly involved \u2013 or both. He continues, for the tea-leaf readers: It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue \u2013 a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons \u2013 new opportunities open up for all. [Applause.] This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington, who has covered America\u2019s confrontation with capital punishment for years, weighs in on the pope\u2019s call to help abolish it \u2013 finally \u2013 in this country: Pope Francis has just thrown down the gauntlet to the handful of largely southern states who are still actively pursuing the death penalty. He put his challenge in global terms \u2013 calling for the worldwide abolition of capital punishment. But his call comes at a particularly sensitive moment in the national debate on the ultimate penalty. After the US supreme court gave the go-ahead in June to a controversial new execution drug, several states are now preparing to restart executions; Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia all have executions scheduled before the end of October. The pontiff went further than his condemnation of the death penalty. He also made an implicit attack on the US fondness for the sentencing of people to life without parole, which some people call \u201clife means life\u201d. The US is the only country in the world that still sentences juveniles under 18 to the sentence, which essentially commits the individual to remain locked up for their entire natural life. Some 2,500 people are currently serving that sentence for crimes they committed as a child. The pope lamented that situation, saying: \u2018A just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.\u2019 Francis now calls again for \u201ca courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity.\u201d I am convinced that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States \u2013 and this Congress \u2013 have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies, aimed at implementing a \u2018culture of care\u2019 and \u2018an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.\u2019 He says there is a need to \u201cdevise intelligent ways of\u2026 developing and limiting our power\u201d and that America\u2019s \u201coutstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution.\u201d Environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg, who is among climate activists outside the US Capitol, weighs in on this crucial environmental passage from Francis, which is getting tons of applause from Democrats: The pope appears in Congress one day after his big shout-out for Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plant plan \u2013 arguably one of the biggest targets of Republicans in both houses as well as on the presidential campaign trail. More than half of Republicans in Congress deny the existence of climate change, or oppose government regulations to cut carbon pollution. Environmental campaigners had thrilled at the prospect of the Pope reprising his powerful message for climate action from the encyclical in front of Republican Catholics such as house speaker, John Boehner. The Pope seems to have avoided the prospect of a direct clash by diving into climate change so deeply in his visit to the White House on Tuesday. But he is still putting on pressure on Congress to act on climate change. It\u2019s been five years since Congress last tried to pass legislation on climate change. The Pope in his speech said it was now time to act. \u201cI have no doubt that the United States \u2013 and this Congress \u2013 have an important role to play,\u201d the Pope said It was a lot gentler than his statements in Laudato Si, for Republican ears anyway. But even the slightest mention of the words climate change are awkward for Republicans, who have typically aligned with the Catholic church on social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage. Pope Francis now turns to Dorothy Day. Day was an American convert to Catholicism, who advocated for \u201cdistributism\u201d, a Catholic economic ideology based on spreading \u2013 rather than centralising \u2013 the means of production, and holding property rights sacred which has often been seen as a theoretical alternative to both socialism and capitalism. A journalist and activist, she was editor of the Catholic Worker newspaper for 47 years and co-founded the pacifist Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement to give aid to the poor and homeless. Her canonization is crurrently being considered by the Catholic Church. \u201cHer social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed, were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints,\u201d Francis says. How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world! How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty! I know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and that in times of crisis and economic hardship a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the same time I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive and sustainable. Big applause for the line about life and the golden rule. Not everyone is happy: Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. The pontiff\u2019s speech continues to address many of what in ordinary circumstances would be considered \u201cthird rails\u201d in American politics. Now, he sets his sights on the death penalty. \u201cThe Golden Rule\u201d - \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d, from Matthew chapter 7, verse 12 - \u201calso reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development,\u201d he says. If this is a hint at abortion, the pontiff does not develop the speech in that direction. Instead, he continues: This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. The death penalty in America could reach the US supreme court. The justices are sitting right in front of the pope. Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome weighs in on this bold, almost anti-Trump immigration language from Francis: Pope Francis is not mentioning any politicians by name, but certainly his comments could be seen as an antidote to the anti-immigrant rhetoric that has consumed the Republican presidential campaign, particularly in remarks by current frontrunner Donald Trump. The pope spoke of two crises: the refugee crisis in Europe, where tens of thousands of migrants and refugees who have escaped war and other hardships are seeking asylum, and the efforts of \u2018thousands of persons\u2019 in the US who have travelled north \u2018in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones\u2019. Francis has always sought to humanize those who live on the margins of society and who he often says are seen as disposable. In a debate that has been consumed by questions of what immigrants take from the country, Francis sought to portray these immigrants as people who have been shaped by circumstances, but are not different from anyone else. \u2018We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation,\u2019 he said. Francis called on lawmakers to \u2018respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome\u2019. Immigration, he suggested, needs to be seen through the prism of our shared humanity, not our differences. Now the pontiff returns to one of American politics\u2019 third rails - immigration. His language that could not be stronger. Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War. He continues, delicately: On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? Applause there. We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. This is language that many listening today have been waiting to hear from a presidential candidate. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u2019 Pope Francis now turns to talk about Martin Luther King, whose \u201cdream\u201d \u2013 applause there \u2013 he says \u201ccontinues to inspire us all\u201d. I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of \u2018dreams\u2019. A standing ovation there, as so-called \u2018Dreamers\u2019 are a key constituency of undocumented immigrants here in the States. Dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment. Dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of a people. But now his speech turns more biting, knowing he is speaking during an election campaign where rhetoric about immigration has been vicious and unbounded. In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. Rollicking applause. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants. From crises abroad, Pope Francis now turns his attention to crises at home \u2013 especially social and economic injustices. \u201cEven in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent,\u201d he says. \u201cOur efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples.\u201d He talks of \u201cnew global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus\u201d. Politics is, the pontiff says, \u201can expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life\u201d. \u201cI do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut I encourage you in this effort.\u201d Now Pope Francis begins to get politically charged, turning from Lincoln to religious extremism and fundamentalism. He says: \u201cAll of us are quite aware of, and deeply worried by, the disturbing social and political situation of the world today.\u201d Francis continues: Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred and brutal atrocities, committed even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. In a turn of phrase which is especially poignant in a legislative chamber which often turns to such rhetoric, he hits out at ideologies painted in divisive terms: A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom and individual freedoms. [Applause.] But there is another temptation which we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps. We know that in the attempt to be freed of enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as people, reject. [Applause.] He says that the response must be one of \u201chope and healing, of peace and justice\u201d. Some early colour from Dan Roberts, at the Capitol: The sight of Pope Francis before an audience more typically seen for the president\u2019s State of the Union address contrasted starkly with the more divisive speech given to Congress by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this year. That was boycotted by a number of Democrats who accused him of improper intervention in domestic politics by urging them to block the White House Iran deal, but Francis was warmly received on both sides of the aisle. As he entered the room to a standing ovation, he paused briefly to shake hands with secretary of state John Kerry and Republican speaker John Boehner. Only Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative Catholic, was noticeable by his absence. Speaking slowly in heavily-accented English that was at times hard to follow, Francis swiftly brought the audience to its feet by celebrating \u201cthe land of the free and the home of the brave\u201d, but appeared to stick closely to a pre-prepared text. The Pope talks about four \u201cgreat Americans\u201d who \u201cshaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people.\u201d Those four, he says, are: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton. Day was an American journalist, theorist, and activist for the poor and needy; Merton was a Catholic mystic and poet, a prolific author, and Trappist monk in Kentucky - both are important figures in American Catholicism. I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day\u2019s work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money and \u2013one step at a time \u2013 to build a better life for their families. These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes, but in their own quiet way sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. Francis wants to address, he says, the many elderly persons who are \u201ca storehouse of wisdom forged by experience,\u201d and young people who, he says, \u201cface difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults.\u201d \u201cI wish to dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your people.\u201d Now, Francis widens his scope. Today I would like not only to address you, but through you the entire people of the United States. Here, together with their representatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day\u2019s work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money and \u2013one step at a time \u2013 to build a better life for their families. Many of those thousands are outside. He addresses the legislators directly and talks about their weighty responsibility. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been invited, called and convened by those who elected you. \u201cYours is a work,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhich makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of Moses.\u201d I would like to think that the reason for this is that I too am a son of this great continent, from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility. Here\u2019s Francis: \u201cI am most grateful for your invitation to address this Joint Session of Congress in \u2018the land of the free and the home of the brave\u2019,\u201d he begins. Pope Francis has entered the chamber to rapturous applause. In case you\u2019re just joining the 12 of us here on the Guardian\u2019s sixth day of live coverage for the pope\u2019s visit to the Americas, this speech is a massive deal. No pope has ever addressed the US Congress in its own house. With Republicans in control, there are bound to be tense moments. My colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner, our Rome correspondent who has been watching the politics of this papacy, offers some important context as Francis walks into the seat of American power \u2013 and prepares to challenge it on policy. This pope is focused on a few key issues: the environment, poverty and taking care of those who live on the margins of society. He may talk about America\u2019s unique role and responsibility as a superpower and will probably describe the importance of diplomacy and dialogue, especially with regard to Cuba and Iran. Immigration is sure to be a big theme, and the many other possibilities include the drug war and the migrant crisis in Europe. He will not want to alienate Republicans in the audience, but nor will he bypass the critical topic of global warming in front of such an influential crowd. It is interesting to note that Antonin Scalia, a Catholic and the most conservative member of the Supreme Court, is absent from the chamber today. Four of his colleagues are there. Presidential candidate Ben Carson is in the Capitol for the Pope\u2019s speech this morning as a guest of South Carolina Republican Mark Sanford, reports Ben Jacobs. Carson, who is polling just behind Donald Trump among Republican primary voters, will be in the gallery watching the pontiff\u2019s address. The former neurosurgeon has recently been the subject of controversy for claiming that a Muslim should not serve as president. His host is no stranger to controversy either. Sanford was embroiled in scandal in 2009 when serving as governor of South Carolina when he disappeared for a week. Sanford\u2019s staffers claimed he was \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d. It turned out the then-governor of South Carolina was in Argentina visiting his mistress. The pope is not only an iconoclast when it comes to politics. He\u2019s also showing scant regard for American traditions ... DC bureau chief Dan Roberts just spotted New Jersey governor and prospective Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie in the gallery. One Republican congressman, Paul Gosar of Arizona, is boycotting Pope Francis\u2019s address to Congress because of the pontiff\u2019s views on climate change, says the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs. Gosar said: This climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into \u2018climate justice\u2019 and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies ... If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. Interesting spot from my colleague Angela Bruno: Jorge Ramos, the Emmy-award winning journalist and Univision anchor who has more recently made headlines for his verbal scuffle with Donald Trump over immigration issues, dishes out both praise and criticism for the Pope in an opinion piece entitled, \u201cA Sinner Pope.\u201d While the Pope has been painted by many as progressive, liberal or even radical, Ramos thinks otherwise \u2013 suggesting the Pope is hardly willing to make any real hard-hitting change and highlights the issues the Pontiff has failed to address thus far: \u201cThe pope\u2019s humbleness, simplicity and accessibility don\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s going to make deep changes in Catholic doctrine. Despite his liberal stances, Pope Francis is hardly a radical. And so far, his changes are all about style, not substance. \u201cWhile he has been celebrated in the media as a religious leader who is refreshingly open to change, Francis still refuses to allow women into the priesthood, do away with the requirement that priests be celibate, embrace gay marriage or approve the usage of contraceptives for 1.2 billion Catholics in the world. \u201cAnd with regard to the sex abuse scandal, Francis hasn\u2019t dared point a finger at those within the church who covered up for criminals. It\u2019s true that unlike his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, Francis has imposed a zero-tolerance policy with regard to sexual abuse, but many of the bishops and cardinals who knew for decades about crimes committed against minors remain in their posts.\u201d Read the full story here. CNN\u2019s commentator just boasted about meeting three popes. But former speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi is out-bragging him. Lauren is in the crowd. Pope Francis compliments Boehner on his green tie, saying it is \u201cthe color of hope,\u201d according to the Associated Press\u2019s Trisha Thomas. A huge crowd is now gathered outside the Capitol building, which is still shrouded in scaffolding. Speaker Boehner greets the pope in the speaker\u2019s ceremonial office. CNN points out that sitting behind the Pope as he addresses the joint session of Congress in just under an hour will be two Catholics: Speaker Boehner, and of course vice-president Joe Biden, the first Catholic ever to hold the office. In what is becoming his trademark humble black Fiat 500, the pontiff has just arrived at the US Capitol building. The Guardian\u2019s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg is with a group of climate protesters outside the Capitol building waiting to hear Pope Francis speak. At 9.25am eastern time (1.25pm GMT) Speaker of the House John Boehner is scheduled to have a one-on-one with Pope Francis in his ceremonial office. This is interesting by the Pew Research Center on the religious affiliations of the US Congress: He has left the Nunciature - the Vatican embassy - as he heads to his motorcade to travel to the Capitol. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino is on the West Lawn of the US Capitol. She sends this dispatch: Ada Bermejo of DREAMers Moms walked to Washington DC from York, Pennsylvania, as party of pilggramge to the nation\u2019s capital to see the pope and draw attention to the immigrants\u2019 plight. \u201cWe brought our stories and experiences as immigrants to Washington,\u201d she said. Bermejo immigrated to the U.S. Illegally from Argentina in 2001. Her three children all qualify for temporary legal status under DACA, the program that defers deportation for those brought to the U.S. As children. Bermejo said she wouldn\u2019t qualify under DAPA, the program that defers action for the parents of US citizens, because her children were not born here. The program has been held up in court. DREAMers Moms stood outside the entrance to the Capitol\u2019s west lawn holding a sign that says \u201cBe our voice. Immigration reform.\u201d Bermejo hopes Congress will listen carefully to the pope\u2019s message on Thursday and finally pass the long-promised comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cWe want Pope Francis to be our voice,\u201d she said, \u201cBecause we are here and we are not going anywhere. The House just gavelled in after morning prayer, reports Dan Roberts at the Capitol. Congressmen were reminded not to try to sneak their staff with them onto the floor. \u201cregulations will be strictly enforced\u201d More from Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome: It is important to put this moment in historical context, which will not be lost on some of the Catholic politicians who will be sitting in the gallery. The US has a long history of anti-Catholic bigotry, which was fuelled by white protestants in the 20th century by groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which saw the faith as a threat to American democracy. By the beginning of the 20th century, noted James Martin in America magazine, one-sixth of the population in the US was Catholic, but Catholicism was not really assimilated into society until the 1950s and 1960s. And yet, it would have been unheard of for a pope to speak before Congress. When John F Kennedy, the only Catholic president in US history, was running for office, he had to give a now-famous speech to a group of protestant ministers in which he reaffirmed that he was not a \u201cCatholic candidate\u201d, but the Democratic candidate who happened to be Catholic, and one that would not take orders from his church. Given today\u2019s events, it is somewhat ironic that Kennedy urged his audience at the time to consider the \u201creal issues\u201d of the day, including the \u201cspread of communist influence until it now festers only 90 miles from the coast of Florida\u201d. The speech would become a model for other candidates whose personal biographies were considered \u201cdifferent\u201d, including candidate Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d speech on race in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s speech on his Mormon faith in his first run for president in 2007. You can watch Kennedy\u2019s historic speech here. Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, who will welcome Pope Francis to congress today, has written a post to his blog detailing the order of today\u2019s proceedings as well as his thoughts about them. \u201cBy about 9:15, I will be in my ceremonial office across from the House floor, getting ready to greet him. People have asked me what I\u2019ll be thinking about. It\u2019s not really a quiet moment, per since you\u2019ve got a pack of photographers there waiting too. One thing I can tell you: typically, I ask our guest how their economy is doing, and go from there. Will have to think of something else. It\u2019ll come to me. It does contain some fascinating titbits about the morning\u2019s procedures. At 10:01 and 30 seconds, the speaker says: \u201c...history. Paul Irving, the House Sergeant-at-Arms, will make the announcement: \u2018Mr. Speaker, the Pope of the Holy See.\u2019\u201d Boehner ends: When you grow up Catholic, you learn about the Pope as a distant figure, closer to God than any of us. To have him here, at our Capitol, among our people, is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. A glimpse of grace. Later today, Pope Francis will travel to New York. Police commissioner Bill Bratton - who is in charge of what has been called an \u201cunprecedented\u201d security operation for the visit - especially as it is taking place during the UN General Assembly - just tweeted a message of welcome to the pontiff: Dan is inside the House of Representatives press gallery right now, and it\u2019s rather crowded... Nuns from the order of the Servants of the Lord pose for a photograph as they wait outside the U.S. Capitol for a chance to see Pope Francis in Washington. Francis is expected to greet the crowd outside from a balcony after addressing members of Congress. It is customary for representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas to arrive hours in advance to stake out her seat on the aisle of the chamber for a State of the Union address, so that she can shake hands and take a picture with the President. Fox News\u2019 Gretawire blog reports that while congressional leadership have tried to discourage that by blocking access to the centre aisle. But Dan Roberts confirms that, nonetheless, Lee is there early as usual - staking out a seat, as close as she can get to where the pope will pass. This is a sneak peek from the Guardian\u2019s DC bureau chief Dan Roberts of the chamber of the US House of Representatives, where Pope Francis will speak. It\u2019s where the State of the Union address and all joint speeches to congress are held. \u201cI\u2019m told we may get some Supreme Court justices today too, so it will really feel like a State Of The Union,\u201d Dan says. Some context this morning from Guardian correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome. When Francis steps up to the podium today in the US Capitol, he will be the first pope to address a joint session of Congress, an occasion that is usually reserved for visiting heads of state. Anticipation has reached a fever pitch - both in Washington and around the world - precisely because this pope is expected to speak on issues that are central to the highly-partisan and often bitter debates that consume American politics today: the environment, immigration, poverty, and the US role in the world. To be sure, his speech will not be a bland recitation that seeks only to please and assure the gathered lawmakers. While most Vatican watchers believe the pope\u2019s primary motivation for visiting the US was to attend the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia this weekend, he clearly sees his visit to the nation\u2019s capital as an opportunity to issue a call to conscience and challenge lawmakers on the issues at the heart of his papacy. Francis has already indicated in speeches that he is not shying away from controversy. Although his language is not abrasive, his repeated references to himself as the son of immigrants, for example, marks an attempt not only to identify with the American experience, but to gently chastise those who have vilified immigrants as freeloaders who take but do not enrich society. He will seek not to lecture, but to nudge the assembled politicians - who are overwhelmingly Christian - to see things from a different and more nuanced perspective, and to free themselves of political rigidity. The pope will stand in front of John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, and Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic vice president who also has the role of president of the Senate. Both men are Catholic and represent the diversity of views within the church across the political spectrum. As a savvy operator, the pope knows he cannot just appeal to one of them. If the sunrise was anything to go by, it\u2019s looking set to be a spectacularly beautiful day in Washington, DC for Pope Francis\u2019 address to Congress. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of day three of Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States. After a politically-charged speech urging action on climate change at the White House yesterday, expectations are high for the pontiff\u2019s speech to a joint session of both houses of Congress, scheduled for 9.20am ET (1.20pm GMT) today. After that, Francis will visit St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic church and the Catholic charities of the Archdiocese of Washington, before heading back to Andrews Joint Air Base to fly to New York City. Here\u2019s his full schedule: 9.20am (1.20pm GMT): Pope Francis addresses a joint session of the US Congress. On the West Front of the US Capitol, a jumbotron broadcast shows the event.
