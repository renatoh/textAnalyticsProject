Jermaine McDonald, 26, was found guilty of assault causing grievous bodily harm, robbery and attempted robbery at Inner London crown court on Friday for the attack in Dulwich Park in April. McDonald stabbed a 31-year-old man in the left side of his head and his chest after he approached the victim and a female friend as they sat on the grass. Reports at the time said the victim tried to stop McDonald from stealing his friend\u2019s handbag, which police later confirmed was stolen in the attack. McDonald used the bank cards in the handbag to spend less than \u00a3100 on cigarettes and alcohol. Police said the victim spent five weeks in intensive care and was only able to leave hospital for brief home visits almost six months after the attack. He is receiving treatment and suffers reduced sensation across the right side of his body resulting in reduced mobility, in addition to severe memory loss. McDonald will be sentenced on 17 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
