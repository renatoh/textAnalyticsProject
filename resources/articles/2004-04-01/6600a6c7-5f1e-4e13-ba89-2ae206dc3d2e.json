The warning follows a recent announcement by Royal Doulton that it will transfer production to Indonesia next year and close its last factory in Stoke-on-Trent, making 525 workers redundant. Ten years ago the company had 5,000 staff in the city. Ministers have been told how a Staffordshire company won a contract to provide cups, saucers and plates for a new hotel in China. Within days of the hotel's opening, a Chinese entrepreneur offered to replace breakages at a tenth of the price the British company would have charged. The British Ceramic Confederation, which has 150 members representing 90% of the UK industry, claims China's entrepreneurs could cost many more British workers their jobs. \"Counterfeiting is dishonest and criminal,\" said Kevin Farrell, the BCC's chief executive. \"It's not a game. Time, investment and resources have gone into the designs that are copied. Stealing copyright is no better than stealing money or anything else.\" China has signed up to the World Trade Organisation, which offers some copyright protection to British firms. One company which has retained its factory in the industry's traditional Staffordshire heartland has identified more than 100 of its designs it says have been copied without acknowledgement and without a licensing agreement. The Dunoon pottery company's mugs, which include pig and cat designs, mugs for Christmas, sports and grandmas and mugs displaying star signs, are particularly popular in China and feature prominently in a catalogue of the ShunQiang company in Chaozhou in Guangdong province. This should be good news for Dunoon. But the company is not profiting from an export success. It is instead being ripped off by counterfeiters and copiers. The Chinese manufacturers may have made a few prototypes but are not thought to have gone into full production of the whole range of designs. It appears that they may wait until they have enough interest in a particular mug and then start production, turning out batches within a month as they exploit advances in technology. British manufacturers have the right to track down wholesalers and distributors and have the stocks of counterfeit wares smashed to bits. \"It's tedious, time consuming and costly but you can deal with the problem,\" said Mr Farrell. But companies are unlikely to be able to track down those responsible for commissioning the copies. Enforcement is much more difficult when counterfeit mugs are exported to countries such as South Korea, where the BCC alleges copyright enforcement is lax. \"Every British company with a counterfeited brand is spending unreasonable sums of money to deal with copying,\" said Mr Farrell. \"We want ministers here to find the person in China to whom we can put our case.\" While the BCC pursues a broad political line, Dunoon, with more than 150 employees in Staffordshire, has taken tough action whenever possible against importers in Europe and Asia for more than two years. \"Some of the copies are more blatant and better than others,\" said Peter Smith, Dunoon's sales director. \"Action to protect our designs costs a lot of money but it is money well spent.\" It is not just the Chinese who steal their ideas: six weeks ago 10,000 German-made cups and saucers with a ripped-off Dunoon zodiac design were destroyed after the company intervened. In his office in the heart of the Potteries, Mr Farrell shows off a mauve Moorcroft vase with a peony pattern. It was made in Burslem, near the doomed Royal Doulton factory. Then he takes out a cheap mug made in China with a flower design from a box: it is a blatant and unacknowledged copy of part of the peony pattern."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
