The players were seeking the same conditions as the US men\u2019s team in areas such as travel, hotel accommodation, the right to play on grass rather than artificial turf, and staffing. Tuesday\u2019s settlement also means the USWNT can now proceed with their appeal over equal pay after a judge surprisingly threw out their case in May. \u201cWe are pleased that the USWNT Players have fought for \u2013 and achieved \u2013 long overdue equal working conditions,\u201d said Molly Levinson, a spokesperson for the players, on Tuesday. \u201cWe now intend to file our appeal to the court\u2019s decision which does not account for the central fact in this case that women players have been paid at lesser rates than men who do the same job. \u201cWe remain as committed as ever to our work to achieve the equal pay that we legally deserve. Our focus is on the future and ensuring we leave the game a better place for the next generation of women who will play for this team and this country.\u201d US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone, who won 158 caps for the USWNT, said the settlement was crucial in moving the sport forward. \u201cThis is an important and welcomed moment for US Soccer and the women\u2019s national team players,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cEarlier this year, I stepped into the role as President, and shortly after we hired Will Wilson as our new CEO. We, and the rest of the leadership team at US Soccer, are focused on taking a new approach at the federation in handling all matters. \u201cI believe our approach helped us reach this agreement and demonstrates the commitment of US Soccer\u2019s new leadership to find a new way forward with the USWNT. This settlement is good news for everyone and I believe will serve as a springboard for continued progress.\u201d She added that the settlement could help players from outside the US. \u201cJust as important, we want to work with the USWNT on growing women\u2019s soccer here in the United States and across the globe,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of this is encouraging Fifa to invest equally in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game, including increasing the World Cup prize money. I will lend my voice and efforts to making this happen not only for the USWNT, but for all women\u2019s national team players and everyone who believes in the women\u2019s game throughout the world.\u201d In the appeal over equal pay, USWNT players are seeking millions of dollars they say are owed to them after alleging years of \u201cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\u201d by US Soccer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
