It is a defence on which the world's credit ratings agencies have relied with increasing frequency as the global economy teeters on the edge of a fresh recession and governments struggle to bring their deficits under control. Yesterday it was the turn of Moody's, which, by downgrading Japan a notch, incurred the righteous anger of Tokyo, which pronounced unwavering market trust in its bonds. But the downgrade \u2013 which the generally more adventurous Standard &amp; Poor's made some months ago \u2013 is merely the latest push downwards in an increasingly frequent process. It has brought havoc and fired indignation in Greece, Ireland and Spain, as well as in the most important and contentious of all cases, the United States. Like Sophocles's guard, the agencies have a point when they protest that they are merely doing what they are required to do. Even so, S&amp;P's president this week stepped down unexpectedly, while denying that this had anything to do with the great outrage against his agency's unprecedented and provocative downgrade of the US. It is true that if countries did not run up debts they could not afford, their ratings would be stronger. But the agencies are not merely market umpires but also market players, with an interest in outcomes. They consistently overrated sub-prime mortgage-backed securities when times were good. Now that times are hard, they are consistently underrating the security of nation states which refuse to bow to agency orthodoxy by cutting expenditure. Anger against the agencies is not simply a case of wanting to shoot the messenger. It is also a matter of revolting against a ratings system that allows a very small number of not-always-brilliant analysts to spread fears that threaten the cohesion of sovereign nations, states and governments. Anger with a system that treats, whatever its denials, the lives of nations as a chip on the bond market gambling tables is well directed. The agencies like to claim that they are acting on behalf of investors. But investors can too often also be speculators, seeking profits on bond trades affecting millions of families and jobs. The US downgrade, in particular, was a reckless act directed against the whole global economy. Its foolishness was promptly underlined as markets flooded into the safe haven of US Treasury bills. These are genuinely serious times. But peoples and governments as well as markets need to hear the Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke put the agencies in their place when he addresses central bankers tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
