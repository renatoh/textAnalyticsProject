Gates sees himself as a grandchild of what Du Bois termed the \"talented tenth\", the black middle class which owes a debt of service to those it has left behind. Since being headhunted by Harvard in 1991, as chair of Afro-American studies and director of the WEB Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research, \"Skip\" (a childhood nickname) Gates is credited with having transformed a sidelined department into the world leader in its field, the envy of academia with a $40m endowment. Among the star professors he lured were the philosophers Kwame Anthony Appiah and Cornel West - the latter a controversial adviser on both Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March in 1995 and the Rev Al Sharpton's nascent presidential bid for 2004. Yet some warn that Gates's achievement threatens to unravel after a public row that has spread into wider politics. It began last October when Harvard's incoming president, Laurence Summers, a former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, reportedly told West to rein in his outside activities. West, one of only 14 top-rank \"university professors\" at Harvard, who takes his lectures into prisons and recently cut a rap CD, said he had been insulted, his scholarship impugned. Questioning Summers's commitment to Afro-American studies and equal opportunity, Gates and Appiah joined West in considering offers from ivy-league rival Princeton. As Sharpton threatened to sue Summers for interfering with West's political activities, Jesse Jackson demanded \"unequivocal commitment to affirmative action [at] our flagship university\". Appiah resigned in January to take up Princeton's offer, principally, he says, to be nearer his partner, the New Yorker editor Henry Finder. Despite appeasing moves from Summers, West followed suit in April. Now Gates, whom Harvard has most at stake in retaining, is poised to decide this summer whether to decamp, fuelling an exodus which Jackson has said would \"blow a hole in the fuselage of academia\". Gates is among the US's best-known African-American intellectuals, a familiar presence in the New Yorker magazine and on TV, on issues from OJ and gangsta rap to ancient Africa. He was one of Time magazine's \"25 most influential Americans\" in 1997, and in 1998 received a national humanities medal from President Clinton at the White House. Few academics can dream of making an arcane scholarly find into a bestseller. Yet Gates, who began his career as a literary critic and historian, a \"vocation\" he still relishes, has done just that. Immobilised after hip replacement surgery two years ago, he chanced upon a 19th-century handwritten manuscript in an auctioneer's catalogue. Through scholastic detective work, he authenticated The Bondswoman's Narrative, written by Hannah Crafts in the 1850s, as the only known US novel by a fugitive slave, and the first by an African-American woman. The manuscript he bought for $8,500 is now worth $350,000, he believes. Published with his introduction in the US in April, the novel made the New York Times bestseller list and is now out in Britain. At 51, Gates is a controversial figure not least for his power both within and outside the academy. His friend, the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, sees him as an \"intellectual entrepreneur - a rare combination of intellect and industry; that's why he arouses the envy of many colleagues\". For Caryl Phillips, professor of English at Columbia university in New York, \"Skip took the path of scholarship, then chose to become a major player, a kingmaker; it's essentially a political role.\" Gates, so far largely silent on the West row, laments the break-up of his \"dream team\". He says, \"I've been trying to allow myself to grieve. We're absorbing a tremendous body blow, losing these two.\" While he contrasts Summers's abrasiveness with his predecessor, Neil Rudenstine, who hired Gates to build up the department, he says: \"Larry Summers is deeply committed in the wake of the d\u00e9bcle to diversity at Harvard and to the department - or I couldn't continue.\" Afro-American studies was born in the late 1960s from student sit-ins amid civil rights protests. Gates sought to move it from a \"feelgood, ethnic cheerleading orientation - a self-esteem machine\" to become a respected academic field. Yet it remains questioned within the academic world. Of some 400 US institutions offering the subject, Harvard is only one of a handful granting doctoral degrees. According to Phillips \"it's deeply politically charged: a minefield where taboo subjects like 'reverse discrimination' come into play\". While there are white as well as black academics teaching Afro-American studies at Harvard, their students are predominantly white. The row has reignited a debate about the role of the black intellectual in racial \"uplift\", and increased tension between upholders of traditional scholarly respectability, which some see Summers as championing, and advocates of a legitimacy conferred by activism, such as West's, outside the ivory tower. \"One has to be bilingual in the academy,\" says Gates, who is making a TV documentary series for BBC2 and PBS on the future of black America, interviewing figures from Colin Powell to Halle Berry. Gates has been a lifelong advocate of affirmative action - \"it's a class escalator; if you cut the electricity, no one moves\". He adds, \"There are black CEOs, yet 35-40% of black children live at or beneath the poverty line; roughly the same as when Martin Luther King Jr was killed. I don't think it's for us to tell black people how they should live their lives. But it's important that some members of the middle class feel responsibility towards the larger black community. Many of us do in my 'crossover' generation\" - those who entered historically white institutions after the civil rights era.\" Gates was born in 1950, the younger of two brothers, in Keyser, West Virginia, and grew up in Piedmont, a \"tiny segregated black community\" in a largely Irish-Italian town. His father, Henry, was a paper mill labourer who moonlighted as a janitor. He lives in the south, and is now 89. Skip Gates's mother, Pauline, was a domestic who became the first black secretary of the parent teacher association. His brother, Rocky, is an oral surgeon working in New York. Gates's childhood memoir, Colored People (1994), written for his daughters, Maggie and Liza, who \"didn't have a clue about who I was or why\", describes how his school had \"integrated without a peep\" after the desegregation ruling of Brown v Board of Education in 1954. With blackpower, he \"stopped being a Negro, turned black and grew the first Afro in Piedmont\". He was also the first African American there openly to date white women. Phillips saw the memoir as a \"rose-tinted\" version of the Jim Crow South. Yet Gates describes how doctors blamed a crippling injury at 14, which needed a series of operations and left him with a permanent limp, on his being an \"over-achiever\" - racist code for uppity. His mother hated white people. \"No one who met my mother would have thought she was a black nationalist,\" says Gates. \"But the scars of racism are deep.\" He became a born-again Christian for a period through watching her suffer depression due to \"severe menopause - a profound hormonal imbalance. She got better but never fully recovered; she was treated as a hypochondriac.\" She died in 1987. \"I was raised to be a doctor, like all smart black kids,\" Gates says. But after pre-med studies (\"where 'nigger' was hung on me so many times that I thought it was my name\"), he fled north to Yale and switched to history. He was among the first large intake of black students, in 1969-73. \"I was in heaven; Yale was full of nerds who loved books; I met black people like me who wanted to be professors.\" He was fascinated by black nationalism, yet distant from it. \"I'm a little country boy,\" he says. \"People from the hills of West Virginia are blessed with a hard-headed common sense. I was at a rally and said to a friend, 'I'm worried I'm not black enough'.\" In a 1996 essay, \"The Parable of the Talents\", Gates criticised \"black bourgeoisie-bashing\" saying \"where Du Bois saw saviours, who would uplift the race, a new generation saw only sellouts\". He says, \"Do you stop being black by being successful? In the 50s, the blackest thing you could be was a doctor or lawyer. But after the 60s, 'genuine' blackness was equated with rebellious identity, the hip-hop ideal. That's a travesty of our tradition.\" Aged 20, he went to Tanzania with the Peace Corps, working at a mission hospital. \"From the time I was 10 I wanted to visit Africa,\" he says. \"We were growing Afros and wearing dashikis; I went to immerse myself in blackness. I hitch-hiked across the equator with a white fellow - the trip of a lifetime.\" He discovered a cultural and genetic continuity between the old and new worlds \"that had been systematically denied\", and was struck that \"most social problems we thought were race-based were class-based: race was a metaphor\". These insights fed his later work. He met his wife, Sharon Adams, who is white, in 1972, when she was working for Jay Rockefeller's campaign for governor of West Virginia, about which Gates planned to write a book. \"He lost, but I met my wife. She was so different from me - beautiful, brilliant and subtle.\" An artist and potter, she became a garden designer. Their two daughters are now at university. Gates won a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1973-74 and, switching to English, became the first African-American to get a PhD there, in 1979. He was taught by Raymond Williams, George Steiner and Soyinka, who remembers him as \"passionate about recovering the African portion of his origins\". Anthony Appiah, a fellow student who grew up in Ghana, found him \"fascinated by Africa and full of energy and intellectual curiosity\". \"I loved Cambridge,\" says Gates. \"I learned to speak in paragraphs, and became a citizen of the world; I went to the theatre and became addicted to Indian food. English food - Yorkshire pudding, steak and kidney pie - would have killed me.\" While a student he was a Time magazine correspondent in London, a city he still loves. Hearing black English people talk like their white class counterparts was a revelation, since \"in America, black people tend to sound like each other\". Stuart Hall, professor emeritus of sociology at the Open University, says Gates \"romanticised Britain and got things wrong; there was not a lot of depth but there was enthusiasm\". Gates - \"with my gold-rimmed cool-blue shades and my bodacious Afro\" - met James Baldwin (\"my own personal oracle\") on the French Riviera in 1973, and became the model for the black journalist in Baldwin's play The Welcome Table (\"a far better and more aggressive interviewer than I was\"). Back in the US, he won a lucrative MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant\" at 30. At 33, he gained tenure and taught at Yale, Cornell and Duke universities before becoming WEB Du Bois professor of the humanities and professor of English at Harvard, aged 41. He became a \"race man\", preserving a black tradition, which he likens to being a Talmudic scholar. \"I wanted to write about African and Afro-American literature,\" he says. \"But dictionaries, encyclopaedias, bibliographies mostly didn't exist in the field in 1973. So over the past 20 years it's been my dream to redress the imbalance.\" He began by \"restoring the voices of lost authors. I like archives, though it's not glamorous.\" In 1982 he rediscovered the 1859 novel, Our Nig, by Harriet Wilson - the earliest known novel by an African-American until the authentication of Hannah Crafts's manuscript. He became series editor in 1988 of the 40-volume Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers, and an expert on neglected slave narratives. His 2,600-page Norton Anthology of African-American Literature (1996) defined a new canon. Elizabeth Alexander, a poet and associate professor (adjunct) of African-American studies at Yale, was a student of Gates in the early 1980s, and recalls his being \"very excited about the discoveries he was bringing to light\". According to Hall, \"there's a feeling, particularly among some women scholars, that he won plaudits for himself with his brash entrepreneurship when others had been pushing at the door for a long time\". Yet Alexander blames not Gates but \"publishers and academia who haven't recognised the hard labour of black women\". Gates broke ground in literary theory, in Race, Writing and Difference (1986) and Figures in Black (1987). The Signifying Monkey (1988) combined fashionable semiotics with African mythology to illuminate authors such as the Harlem Renaissance's Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker. He insisted on links across the African diaspora and in 1990 revived and co-edited with Appiah and Soyinka the journal Transition - first published in Uganda in 1961 - whose editorial board includes Carlos Fuentes, Derek Walcott and Toni Morrison. At Harvard he pursued a talent for recruitment. Homi Bhabha, Rothenburg professor of English and American literature at Harvard, says he created an \"inspired and inspiring scholarly salon\", which includes the British Turner prize-shortlisted filmmaker Isaac Julien. Gates, whose leisure pursuits include jazz and Hollywood movies, is a keen collector of African and African-American art. He is very gregarious, says Appiah. \"He's happy to work with those he disagrees with, as long as he thinks they're serious and not bogus.\" In Loose Canons: Notes on the Culture Wars (1992) Gates wrote: \"African-American culture is not an exclusive, separate thing without an influence on 'American' culture. That's a racialist fiction. We're also part of a national culture. And that's where the real stakes lie: in redefining how that nation defines its culture.\" He weighed in to battles over the curriculum, taking issue with Harold Bloom for believing that \"the expansion of the canon has meant the destruction of the canon\", and for excluding many women and ethnic minority writers. Gates's affirmation of black culture while rejecting black nationalism has put him at odds not only with the \"intellectual protectionists\" of the right but with Afrocentrics such as Molefi Kete Asante, professor of African-American studies at Temple University, Philadelphia. Gates rejects the idea that culture is \"genetically determined\" and the \"ill-advised belief that only black people can teach or study Afro-American studies. Minority studies are not for minorities. If one has to look like a subject to teach or study it, this is mysticism not scholarship. If anyone said I couldn't teach Milton or Shakespeare, that would be interpreted as racist.\" He has also attacked the black \"scapegoating of Jews, Koreans, women, even black immigrants\". He wrote: \"Appeals to nationalism - and at the extreme fringes, to anti-Semitism, homophobia, and sexism - are drawn upon to mask class differences within the black community.\" He has said, \"I've had arguments with the Nation of Islam over their bogus claims that Jews ran the slave trade. It's an embarrassment to me that we would demonise a religion for our problems.\" Such stands, and his growing political role, have their critics. After Gates's defence of the \"cultural validity\" of the rap group 2 Live Crew in an obscenity case in 1990, the feminist writer and academic bell hooks objected to black academics who try to own and \"police black popular culture\", masking its \"radical potential\". Gates ascribes black poverty to \"both structure and agency. There's never been more educational opportunity for black people than now, but it's a question of keeping them from making disastrous life choices, like having a baby at 16,\" he says. He contrasts a generation of immigrants from India and west Africa \"who have made it in the system by practising what our people did in the 1950s\" with today's inner-city youth \"who identify 'acting white' with standard English, straight-As and the Smithsonian\". The fault, he suggests, lies partly with 60s notions of black \"authenticity\" that persist on the street. As he said in his Jefferson lecture in Washington in March, as \"acts of literacy are stigmatised as acts of racial betrayal... we have ourselves reforged the manacles\" of the slave era. Others criticise this stance as blaming poverty on the poor. Gates \"sees part of his mission as being to take the good news outside the ivory tower\", says Homi Bhabha. Gates's essays as a staff writer for the New Yorker, on subjects from Louis Farrakhan to Harry Belafonte, are collected in Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man (1997). The Future of the Race (1996) and The African American Century (2000), co-edited with West, were aimed at popular readerships. \"I'm proud of those projects,\" he says. For Phillips, Gates's great talent is to take what's unearthed in the library \"and put it before a broad public\". Gates co-edited with Appiah the Dictionary of Global Culture (1998) and the interactive Encarta Africana (1999) - the \"black Britannica \" that grew from an idea of the pan-Africanist Du Bois. Microsoft reportedly put up $1m for the CD-rom: a marriage of Skip Gates and Bill Gates. \"It had a direct impact outside the ivory tower,\" says the professor, who started a private company, Afropedia LLC, to manage the project. In 1999 he made a TV series, Wonders of the African World (broadcast on BBC2 as Into Africa ). \"The noble history of African civilisations has been systematically denied by the west,\" he says. In the US 20 million people watched it over three nights, \"which is extraordinary\". \"Roots meets Kenneth Clark's Civilisation \", said the New York Times. But Gates was also fiercely attacked as a \"black ambassador of Eurocentrism\", mainly for emphasising the role of African kingdoms in the slave trade. Asante saw it as a \"travesty... which mocks African culture, distorts African history, reinforces stereotypes\". For Lisa Aubrey, professor of political science and African studies at Ohio University, its \"caricature and cartooning\" of Africa was on a par with Steven Spielberg's Amistad . Soyinka defends the series as a \"landmark. History is history; you don't excise some of it because it's unpleasant.\" Gates has been attacked as an heir to Booker T Washington - an adversary of Du Bois and the most powerful African- American at the turn of the 19th century. According to Adolph Reed, professor of political science at the New School University in New York, Gates replicates Washington's anointed role as the \"singular, trusted informant to communicate to whites what the Negro thought, felt, wanted, needed\". Gates responds: \"Who's a spokesman? Who's authentic? It's an unending struggle. Does one criticise the black community? One's responsibility is to call it the way one sees it. Appeal to race loyalty is a trick.\" He adds: \"Nobody has that much power now. There are a multiplicity of black voices. The affirmative action generation is firmly established; black leadership is more diversified.\" While Reed criticised Gates as a \"freelance advocate of black centrism\" lacking a community base, others see him - neither radical nor conservative - as having no politics. But for Hall, he follows the \"strand of black politics\" represented by Booker T Washington, whereby \"you advance your cause by making yourself acceptable to white society, not by political struggle but economic self-advancement: going into big business, not grassroots politics. Gates wants the talented tenth to lead from the front, rather than empower from below.\" Yet he recruited West, a \"very opposite figure; Skip wants that politics inside Harvard, but he's not on the stump\". At Harvard, among endowments Gates secured was a $3m gift from Time Warner for the Quincy Jones chair in African-American music. According to Hall, Gates \"doesn't have a politics that would inhibit him from approaching major philanthropic figures and big corporations - unlike radical groups dubious about big business giving money to help the brothers\". Yet for Hall \"the endearing thing about Skip is it's so open. There's an almost innocent warmth and transparency in his being a boy from the backwoods who's made it. His position isn't hypocritical - like those who claim to be in touch with the grassroots while furthering their careers.\" Some have seen the Harvard spat as a cynical ploy to hike salaries already in six figures. Thulani Davis in the Village Voice denounced \"privileged men [calling] the race troops to arms for no greater reason than to enhance their already cushy careers\". Gates dismisses the accusation as \"ridiculous: the difference between a top professor at Harvard and Princeton is pennies\". Yet it has highlighted drawbacks in the academic star system. Harvard \"buys in the brightest of black talent and concentrates it in an \u00e9lite space,\" says Hall. \"Its payoff is national visibility, but many smaller Afro-American departments are struggling.\" In Phillips's view \"Afro-Am is a nascent field, and Skip's in a perfect position to ground it. But it hasn't happened because it became about personalities and power, not about scholarship. The academic world is about superstar appointments, where you're transferred like a footballer; it can be blown apart by an argument over bruised egos.\" Phillips says that \"vast amounts have been raised at Harvard because Skip has the cachet to bring in the names. If he goes, money will go with him.\" Yet Gates is at pains to stress that what he has built would live on without him. He is torn, however, not least by a \"deep affection and loyalty to Anthony Appiah - my best friend on earth, the godfather of my children\". The dilemma remains: \"Do I join my friends, who helped to build the greatest Afro-American department in the world? Or do I nurture and protect the institution we built?\" Life at a glance Henry Louis Gates Jr Born: September 16 1950, Keyser, West Virginia, USA.
