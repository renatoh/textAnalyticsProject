In fact, McIlroy's approach is the opposite of that. Legitimately, he traces his toils in 2013 partly to not playing enough competitive events in the early part of the year. Game time was essential after McIlroy's switch to new Nike equipment, with the 24-year-old perfectly open about the fact he made an error in opting for a light schedule in advance of the Open Championship. Now McIlroy has a chance to redress that balance. The world No2 will next appear in Akron at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational, a tournament which has the added benefit to the struggling McIlroy of having no halfway cut. \"I'm really looking forward to Akron,\" McIlroy said. \"It's a place where I have done well before. It's a place I feel I can win. So going there, I will be really excited to just play four rounds of golf. \"It's a great place to practise, as well. It has great facilities and you couldn't ask for better preparation for the defence of the PGA the week later.\" From there, McIlroy, who missed the Muirfield cut on Friday after posting a \"sloppy\" 12 over par, heads to Oak Hill to defend the major he won in such emphatic style at Kiawah Island last year. He is then scheduled to play in the FedEx Cup play-off events: the Barclays, Deutsche Bank Championship, the BMW Championship and, qualification depending, the play-off finale of the Tour Championship in Atlanta. That run ends on 22 September. As things stand, the young Northern Irishman's year will end with two tournaments plus an exhibition match against Tiger Woods in China, added to another defence, of his DP World Tour Championship in Dubai."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
