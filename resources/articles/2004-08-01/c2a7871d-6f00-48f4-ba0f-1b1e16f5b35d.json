And then the Americans attack the houses. But it's innocent civilians that get killed. Both sides claim they are right. But both are wrong.\" In Sadr City, Baghdad's teeming slum which is home to two million Shia, there was little sign yesterday of the previous night's battle, when the US military launched its biggest incursion into the maze of narrow alleys and dusty roads. Outside Mr Aabid's softdrinks shop, a couple of black goats grazed on a mountain of rubbish. Around the corner, a serried line of American tanks stood in the fierce afternoon sunshine. A short drive in the other direction, past a tangle of twisted cars and smouldering barricades, a solitary Mahdi army fighter armed with a Kalashnikov stood on a corner. It is here that support for the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr appears at its most fervent; dozens of young men have already gone to Najaf to defend the Imam Ali shrine; others have stayed put to ambush the Americans here. The US military claimed it had killed 50 Sadr fighters in overnight fighting. According to Mr Aabid, however, most of the victims were ordinary people like him. Nobody knew how many had died. \"My two children couldn't sleep. I held both of them in my arms all night. They were trembling. The American bombs were so loud,\" he said. \"Our message to the Americans is 'stop shooting into houses. Unarmed people live there'.\" But Mr Aabid and other Sadr City residents said they were as fed up with the Mahdi army, whose hit-and-run tactics invariably lead to a disproportionate US response. \"We hated Saddam. But in the Saddam era we didn't have bullets being fired into our shops. The only gunfire was at wedding parties,\" he said. While the battle between the Mahdi army and the US forces has been portrayed as an epic struggle against foreign occupation, other residents said the problem was more basic: a lack of jobs. \"The only employment round here is to be a policeman, soldier or a dustman. I believe that if the government provides jobs then the Mahdi army will simply throw away their weapons. They'll pick up shovels instead,\" Fadhil Jasim, 35, said. Nearby, dozens of posters of Mr Sadr were plastered on unpowered street lights; black Sadr flags fluttered from the roofs. Virtually all of the shops were boarded up. No women could be seen. Few residents were prepared to criticise the cleric's militia directly, but there were oblique stirrings of discontent. Ra'ad Khalaf, a 24-year-old shopkeeper, said he was a supporter of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, who has called for the fighting in Najaf to stop and is in hospital in London. Lieutenant Colonel Lopez Carter, commander of the US battalion that led yesterday's operation, said his troops had \"thrown the Mahdi army off balance\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
