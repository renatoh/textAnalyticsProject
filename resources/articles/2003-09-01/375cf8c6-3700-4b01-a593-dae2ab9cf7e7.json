And the late submissions appeared to put defence secretary Geoff Hoon and Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff, back in the dock over Dr Kelly's own death. Professor Keith Hawton, director of the Oxford centre for suicide research, was recalled to the stand to reveal Dr Kelly's widow had told him the former government scientist always believed his mother committed suicide while he was an undergraduate at Leeds University in the 1960s. Although the coroner at the time recorded an open verdict after Mrs Kelly died of barbiturate poisoning following a stroke, Dr Kelly had agreed with his verdict that the balance of her mind had been disturbed. She had also suffered from depression. Dr Kelly was later prescribed tranquillisers for insomnia and his 1985 MoD security vetting recorded his mother had committed suicide and he had a character reference from an anonymous friend whose mother had committed suicide at the same time. However, Professor Hawton said in his opinion it was not a factor in Dr Kelly's death and he was \"uncertain whether this adds anything further\" to the information already known. Professor Hawton said he stood by his conclusion that if Dr Kelly committed suicide it was through a \"severe loss of self esteem and dismay at being exposed in the media\", with particular anxiety at the emails he had received requesting answers to parliamentary questions on the morning of his death. The discussion about Dr Kelly's mother came after several other late submissions of evidence. Another pertinent piece of information submitted included Dr Kelly's mobile phone bill and an email from Mr Powell. That email, sent on the morning of July 9, initially seemed to suggest Mr Powell was demanding Mr Hoon put Dr Kelly's name in the open. The relevant paragraph read: \"Jonathan has suggested to the secretary of state that we should simply name our man, but he left the submission to Mr Hoon who has not yet reached a final view.\" The letter was sent from to MoD press officer Kate Wilson from Peter Watkins, private secretary to Geoff Hoon, ahead of the Q&amp;A briefing drawn up for press inquiries. On closer inspection, however, it appears to be referring only to naming Dr Kelly in Mr Hoon's private and confidential letter to Gavyn Davies, chair of the BBC's board of governors. The inquiry also today heard more evidence from MoD official James Harrison, the man who forwarded the parliamentary questions to Dr Kelly on the day of his death. There were six questions - some from Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP on the foreign affairs select committee, and Bernard Jenkin, shadow defence secretary - demanding to know what rules Dr Kelly may have broken, which journalists he had spoken to, and what disciplinary action may be taken against him. Mr Harrison, the deputy director of the counter proliferation and arms control unit, said he thought Dr Kelly was already over the worst by the time those emails arrived. \"My perception was the peak of pressure had very much passed.\" Recalled to give evidence for a third time, the MoD's personnel director Richard Hatfield today submitted a new witness statement in the light of Dr Kelly's mobile phone details, readjusting the times at which he spoke to him ahead of the release of the MoD press statement on 8 July. This cleared up a contradiction in earlier evidence when he had told the inquiry he had read out the statement in full to Dr Kelly before 5pm, whereas records showed the time was in fact 5.10pm - closer to the time of the statement's release. He had also added an amendment to his statement specifying Dr Kelly's contact with Mr Gilligan as \"unauthorised\", but he said he still \"cannot be absolutely sure\" whether he mentioned the Q&amp;A briefings to Dr Kelly. Questioned by the counsel for the inquiry, Richard Dingemans QC, if he could have read out the entire statement in the recorded three minutes 49 seconds, Mr Hatfield said he could normally have read it out in under two minutes, saying, \"I speak very fast.\" Another witness who made a final appearance today was Sunday Times journalist Nick Rufford, who denied claims by Dr Kelly's widow that he had been an unwelcome surprise when he arrived at the Kelly's Oxfordshire home on the night of the July 9. He also said there was no reason for Dr Kelly to have been upset, as he said he was, at the later Sunday Times story, since he had \"honoured the off the record\" portions of their conversation. He also said the conversation was longer, at 15 minutes, than Mrs Kelly remembered and he explained the reference to Rupert Murdoch in their conversation as being a light-hearted joke. He explained Dr Kelly always asked if their dinner expenses were \"on Mr Murdoch?\" and this had applied to the offer of accommodation also. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
