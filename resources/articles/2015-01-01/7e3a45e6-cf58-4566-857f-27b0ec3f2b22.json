He\u2019s a Burnley player and he\u2019s happy where he is. One day I might turn up for work in a clown suit with a custard pie going \u2018Fooled you \u2013 he\u2019s gone!\u2019 But I am not expecting to. The club have made it clear he\u2019s not for sale in this transfer window.\u201d Instead of selling, in fact, Burnley have just bought a player, a Manchester United player no less, so how did a relegation-threatened club pull off the signing of Michael Keane without attracting the attention of rival bidders? \u201cI had my cloak as well as my dagger,\u201d Dyche says. \u201cWhen you have both it makes you a very powerful force. No, not really. The deal was in place since the player came on loan at the start of the season. We felt we could afford to let Michael see what the setup here was all about before committing himself because we knew he would enjoy it, and he has.\u201d Confidence seems to course through Dyche and find its way into his players. Though results have not always gone their way, Burnley\u2019s self-belief has never wavered, and after a tricky opening period and long wait for a first win, recent battling performances to come from behind to earn draws at Manchester City and Newcastle have underlined the spirit in the squad. What Dave Bassett used to term the smell of relegation is nowhere to be found at Burnley\u2019s training ground. Dyche, a no-nonsense former defender turned no-nonsense coach with a surprisingly deft aptitude for man-management, simply would not put up with it. \u201cIf we are gaining a reputation for not knowing when we are beaten it is down to the group, not to me,\u201d he says modestly. \u201cOur ability to keep going is probably getting recognised now because of recent results, but people who have watched us for a while will know it is an ongoing trend. We don\u2019t give up, it\u2019s what we are like and it goes back at least to the start of last season. We haven\u2019t just started to recover from setbacks and turn games around, we believe in a relentless manner of playing and have done for a while. It is how we got ourselves out of the Championship.\u201d Fitness plays a big part in Dyche\u2019s regime. All his players must demonstrate the energy levels necessary to compete for a full 90 minutes, though essentially, he believes, the will to win is a psychological attribute that the players work on themselves. \u201cThe only thing I tell the players is that games can twist and turn very quickly, you\u2019ve got nothing to lose if you play hard for every minute and everything to gain,\u201d Dyche explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset more than anything, but I know that physically they are more than capable of carrying it out. What pleases me is that the players respond to their own demands, not just mine. The inner demand of a group is as powerful, if not more powerful, than the manager\u2019s voice. Once you get the group making demands of itself that can be a really strong force in your favour, and I think that has been shown. Even our substitutes buy into the group dynamic, they come on ready to make a difference. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the unity and determination we have shown this season, but I\u2019m not getting carried away. We still need more points.\u201d The next few games could be crucial in that respect, with Queens Park Rangers at home on Saturday afternoon beginning a sequence of what might be termed winnable matches that will also bring Crystal Palace and West Bromwich to Turf Moor in the coming weeks. Dyche winces at the word winnable. \u201cAll matches are winnable, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere are never any guarantees, I don\u2019t believe in must-win games except the next one. The next game is always the one you must try your hardest to win. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is against, whether they have just changed their manager or whether they are the defending champions. Points are points, wherever they come from, and you won\u2019t pick them up unless you go into every game with a belief you can get something.\u201d While a win on Saturday would take Burnley above Harry Redknapp\u2019s unconvincing travellers, Dyche prefers to look at the season as a whole and will not set targets or make predictions until the final whistle has blown on the final game. \u201cWe are improving,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I can be reasonably certain about. Our performance level is rising, we are getting more clinical at the top end of the pitch, we know we\u2019ve got energy because the stats are through the roof, the signs are all good but we have to keep collecting points. The last five games brought us five points, which doesn\u2019t sound a lot but you\u2019ve got to look at who we played against. Southampton, Spurs, Liverpool, City and Newcastle. That\u2019s some fixture list, and an average of one point per game is not bad for a team people were saying would never win a match in the Premier League. Some of the performances were very good too. \u201cObviously I would have liked another win [the only win in the sequence was Southampton at home] or a few more points, but you have to be realistic. This is a division where teams can get hurt, and we are underdogs in just about every game we go into. We are not in a position to be greedy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
