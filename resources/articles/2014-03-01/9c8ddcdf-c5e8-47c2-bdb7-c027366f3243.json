The champion neocon pitches up to chide Europe for failing to rein in Putin and failing to uphold the principle that big countries just can't invade small ones on a flimsy pretext. He then seems aggrieved when Justin Webb points out that many make the same observation about the US and Iraq. People charge you with hypocrisy, said Webb. You \"laid the groundwork\" for this sort of thing. \"That's nonsense,\" snapped Wolfowitz, who quickly got personal. \"I guess you were against our going into Afghanistan to get rid of al-Qaida as well,\" he sneered at Webb. \"We should be looking forward, not in the rear view mirror,\" exclaimed the Wolf; though moments earlier he himself cited appeasement in the 1930s, darkly quoting Neville Chamberlain. The past is another country. If it had its own oil, Wolfowitz might have sent troops there as well. \u2022 And yet some will say he has a point. There is that danger that a few will play down Putin's landgrab for the sake of a quiet life. Some appear to be adapting to the new position already. A reader travelling first class on Virgin Trains notes a new Russia-themed menu called the Trans-Siberian. This includes beetroot roulade and chicken kiev. Always canny, Virgin. Might there be franchises to chase in Putin's client state? \u2022 Heady days for William Hague, meanwhile, as he enjoys an extended period in the public eye thanks to Putin's machinations. Hague may not have been the full ballot box as Tory leader, but he continues to excel in many regards since. Last week, the foreign secretary visited Eppleby Forcett Primary school in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency, where he was quizzed by pupils on the crisis in Ukraine. \"He answered all the children's questions frankly,\" reports the Darlington &amp; Stockton Times. \"Then Mr Hague helped the infants class design a go-cart.\" It bears his signature. If in doubt, it veers right. \u2022 Two men, two great religions. So what transpires when the pope meets the archbishop of Canterbury? As one might expect, oneupmanship and rank-pulling. The Watford Observer heard Justin Welby describe such a meeting. \"Soon after his appointment as archbishop, he met the equally new pope. Once the photographers had gone, the two men spent their first private minute together just laughing ('me in English, him in Italian \u2013 and with a very confused interpreter'), both of them equally surprised to be there. 'I am senior to you,' said Pope Francis, joshing, 'by two days'.\" \u2022 Joy and pain in Oxford following the curious incident of the celebrated author who barked in the night \u2026 and got his way. Author Mark Haddon lives in leafy north Oxford. His new neighbour \u2013 a travel trade millionaire \u2013 bought two houses next to his and then applied to build an underground lido. Swimming pool, sauna, two extra rooms \u2013 an iceberg house. All the rage in Notting Hill. The trouble was that it would have meant the temporarily despoiling of some of the Haddon garden during the great construction. City planners were in favour, Haddon strongly objected, and in a bold move Oxford city councillors last week voted as one to Haddon's advantage. A man of bark and bite. \u2022 We have been wondering, finally, what to do about Justin Hinchcliffe, the north London Tory organiser who hit the headlines as a callow youth advising the poor to fish from the Thames. He now cynically seeks to boost his party's fortunes by calling his election campaigning leaflets the \"guardian\" and ripping off our typeface. Last week we flagged up the \"west green Guardian\". Today, a confused reader sends further evidence retrieved from her recycling bin: a boastful Conservative document that lauds Boris Johnson and styles itself the Tottenham Guardian. Some say we should revert to law. Others advise us to make a call \u2013 discreet, untraceable \u2013 and secure what they describe as the people's justice. But we're bigger than that, upholders of law, and anyway such things are a devil to keep secret. Still, we could always say we were provoked.
