The four-year-old was winning for the first time since June 2008, but has come up against some high-quality opposition this year. He finished last in the Arc, 41 lengths adrift of the winner. On his previous start, Steele Tango had also had a rear view of Sea The Stars, when fifth in Eclipse at Sandown, beaten 14 lengths. \"He has a heart as big as a lion,\" said his trainer, Roger Teal, who had not won a Group race before. \"Everyone was so disappointed two weeks ago, but he managed to get in the race today. There was a Listed race I had in mind for him at the end of the month, but he was so well after the Arc that we had to run him, and he could be over the top in two weeks.\" At Cheltenham, Snap Tie made a winning debut over fences but did not impress with his jumping and remains widely available at 20-1 for the Arkle Trophy at next year's Festival. \"He was quite careful early on, but at least that means he's got respect for the obstacles,\" said Philip Hobbs, who also trained the runner-up, Safari Journey, and competed a double with Templer in the three-mile handicap hurdle. Snap Tie, narrowly beaten in the Christmas Hurdle last season, will return to Cheltenham for a Grade Two event next month. Hobbs said he will avoid racing the gelding on soft surfaces. Inglis Drever, three times a winner of the World Hurdle at the Festival, had to be put down yesterday morning after an attack of colic. The 10-year-old had been retired in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
