Historically the defeat to Sri Lanka on Friday should not have surprised us. After all, England had lost their previous three World Cup encounters against them. Yet the form book suggested it would be a gentle canter for Morgan and his fearless marauders. Until the match at Headingley this Sri Lankan side had appeared rudderless and miserable, finding plenty of excuses for playing badly: the weather, the schedule, the practice facilities, the pitches. By contrast, England were progressing serenely enough, despite the blip against Pakistan. Now Sri Lanka\u2019s win gives scope for hope among the chasing pack , though this would depend on England losing to at least two of the stronger teams that await them: Australia, India and New Zealand. The Sri Lankans are no longer moping around. Their captain, Dimuth Karunaratne, could glow at the performance of Lasith Malinga especially after his veteran pace bowler had flown home twice during the tournament after the death of his mother-in-law. Angelo Mathews, whose unbeaten 85 was critical to the victory, is no longer a glowering Achilles stuck in his tent but a wily old soldier committed to the cause. \u201cAngelo told us it was getting slower and slower,\u201d said Karunaratne. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get to 280-300 but we could get 240 and that would be a good total.\u201d It was not that good a score, but good enough on the day. Ridiculously one can surmise that England might have found 300 an easier target. Then they would have had to bat with more purpose; there would have been fewer decisions to make out in the middle about the best way to proceed. Sometimes it seems they do not want to think too much out there. They just want to \u201cexpress themselves\u201d. Friday\u2019s defeat should not be decisive. But it does add a bit of spice to this week\u2019s games. The match against Australia at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday is not just about bragging rights or laying down a marker ahead of a possible crunch meeting later in the tournament \u2013 England need the points. The coach, Trevor Bayliss, is a shoulder shrugger. Outwardly he stays on an even keel whatever the outcome. He did not surprise with the explanation of England\u2019s second defeat at this World Cup. \u201cObviously it was our batting, I thought our bowling was pretty good, superb in fact,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting? We weren\u2019t as busy as we normally are. Normally on a wicket like this one \u2013 not the easiest to play big shots on \u2013 we\u2019re still busy and knocking singles around into the gaps. We didn\u2019t do that well enough.\u201d He was asked whether nerves played a part. The matches of the last two weeks remind us that there is a world of difference between tournament cricket and a bilateral ODI series, where the odd defeat does not matter much. \u201c I honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d said Bayliss, a refreshing response in an age when we all seem to require certainty at every interrogation. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of noise around the England team when playing well. We just took it a little bit easy with the bat, thinking if we just bat a bit of time we\u2019ll put a partnership together. We forgot about the process we actually go through to put those partnerships together. That gave Sri Lanka confidence. They certainly bowled well, hit their lengths and changed their pace.\u201d The most memorably inappropriate dismissal was that of Moeen Ali, caught on the long off boundary. But Bayliss does not hang his men out to dry. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything to him yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s disappointed. Other times he goes out, hits it over the fence and we\u2019d be yelling: \u2018Great shot.\u2019 But it was not a great time to play that after hitting the six the ball before. I\u2019m no more disappointed than Mo with that shot.\u201d Bayliss repeated that stance when discussing the contribution of James Vince, who is deputising for Jason Roy at the top of the order. As ever Vince tantalised at Headingley, unfurling two great shots before getting out. \u201cIt is not as infuriating for me as it is for him\u201d said Bayliss. \u201cHe looks a million dollars then he finds a way to get out. Hopefully he\u2019s one of those guys who can put one together and it tips him over the edge and he gets a string of big scores.\u201d However Vince\u2019s frailties are bound to increase the pining for Roy\u2019s return. \u201cIf someone of Jason\u2019s ilk is not playing you\u2019re going to miss him. I\u2019m not sure when he\u2019ll be back but we\u2019re looking forward to that,\u201d Bayliss said, stressing that they would not take any risks with him. Judging by how gingerly Roy trotted on to the field to pass on some fresh gloves to an England batsman at Headingley (an unnecessary task for the lower order) he will not be fit for the game against Australia. It may well be that England would be prepared to wait until the semi-finals before reintroducing the opener \u2013 if they get there. The likelihood remains that they will but at Headingley they were served with a delicious reminder not to take that for granted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
