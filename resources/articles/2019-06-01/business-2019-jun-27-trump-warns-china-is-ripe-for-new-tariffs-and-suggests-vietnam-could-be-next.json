Air Force One took off on a fiercely hot day from Washington and Trump seemed to promise heat of his own when he meets leaders of the G20 countries in Japan. Declaring that he enjoyed a strong hand in the trade war with China, he made clear he\u2019ll be in no mood to give much ground when he holds closely watched talks with President Xi Jinping on Saturday. \u201cChina\u2019s economy is going down the tubes \u2013 they want to make a deal,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network. Trump has already imposed levies on $200bn of Chinese imports in an effort to force Beijing to adhere to intellectual property laws. The president indicated he was also ready to slap tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports, worth more than $300bn. \u201cYou have another $325bn that I haven\u2019t taxed yet \u2013 it\u2019s ripe for taxing, for putting tariffs on,\u201d he told Fox. During Wednesday\u2019s interview, Trump also hinted he might impose tariffs on Vietnam, describing the country as \u201cthe single worst abuser of everybody\u201d. \u201cA lot of companies are moving to Vietnam, but Vietnam takes advantage of us even worse than China. So there\u2019s a very interesting situation going on there,\u201d Trump said. Trump said that that the China trade tariffs were only hurting China, while the US was benefiting from the situation. \u201cWhat is happening is people are moving out of China. Companies are moving out of China, by the way, some are coming back to the United States because they don\u2019t want to pay the tariff,\u201d he said. Trump did say that a previous threat to tax remaining tradeat 25% could be changed to a less harsh 10%. The two sides said they were close to a deal before talks broke down in May. \u201cWe were about 90% of the way there,\u201d the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told CNBC television, adding he was looking forward to the Trump-Xi talks but stressing there would be no deal for \u201cthe sake of a deal.\u201d \u201cI hope the message that we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table,\u201d Mnuchin said. Trump\u2019s aggressive attempt to rewrite the rules with China are part of a wider policy of fixing what he says is a system rigged against the United States. \u201cAlmost all countries in this world take tremendous advantage of the United States. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said in his lengthy interview. Casting his eye over the wider landscape, Trump also lashed out at close partners Germany and Japan. He described Germany \u2013 part of the bedrock of the US alliance with western Europe \u2013 as \u201cdelinquent\u201d for not paying enough to NATO\u2019s budget. \u201cSo Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars for energy, okay,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they are giving Russia billions of dollars yet we are supposed to protect Germany and Germany is delinquent! Okay?\u201d Trump aired a similar complaint about Japan, Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia and host of the G20 summit, which has been under the protection of a US military umbrella since its defeat in the second world war. \u201cIf Japan is attacked, we will fight World War III. We will go in and protect them with our lives and with our treasure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us. They can watch it on a Sony television.\u201d Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump remained coy on expectations for his meeting at the G20 with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. Trump has been criticised for what opponents see as an oddly opaque relationship between the two leaders and he did little to dispel the controversy. \u201cI\u2019ll have a very good conversation with him,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWhat I say to him is none of your business.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
