Mr Caudwell, who set up the company in 1987, said he had delayed the sale of his fixed-line telecoms arm, Cauldwell Communications, and was inviting offers for the wider Caudwell Group instead. Mr Caudwell, who owns 85% of the company, said he wanted to sell the group as a whole as it would be the best way of protecting employees. As well as more than 350 Phones4U stores across the UK, Caudwell Group has a fixed-line operation serving homes and businesses, plus repairs, logistics and equipment supplies units. Mr Caudwell said he did not have \"preconceived ideas\" abut the company's valuation but claimed it compared \"incredibly favourably\" with its rival Carphone Warehouse in most key respects. Carphone, Europe's largest independent mobile phone retailer, is worth an estimated \u00a31.9bn. Britain's 29th-richest man with a fortune of \u00a31.28bn, according to the Sunday Times, Mr Caudwell founded his company with his brother Brian in Stoke-on-Trent. He was running a car repair business when he discovered he could receive a discount on the \u00a31,500 price of a mobile phone if he became a dealer. The business took eight months to sell its first order of 26 phones; it now sells 26 a minute. Mr Caudwell, 53, has acquired a reputation for eye-catching stunts. He once showed staff what a \u00a31m bonus would look like, carting the cash out on a stage in briefcases, accompanied by loud music, indoor pyrotechnics and flashing lights spelling the word \"millionaire\". In another ploy to offer staff incentives, he once launched a high-level graduate scheme with starting salaries of up to \u00a360,000. He also banned staff from emailing each other, saying they could save three hours a day by doing things over the phone and face to face. Mr Caudwell said today that the sale of the company would give him some time to pursue other ambitions, such as getting more involved with the charity he founded. \"I strongly believe the group has enormous potential for further growth in the UK and internationally,\" he said in a statement. \"The hands-on contribution required from me as the principal shareholder is ... now more limited and I have, as a result, decided to invite offers for the group.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
