Over 18 years, Leigh Francis\u2019s characterisation has been stretched paper thin across more than a dozen formats and vehicles, including 19 series of Celebrity Juice, five of Through the Keyhole and a poorly received feature film. He is like a monster that has escaped its creator and run amok across the schedules. Now Lemon means to crack the US, a journey chronicled in Keith Lemon: Coming in America. \u201cI\u2019m already massive in\u2019t UK,\u201d he says, but he now wants to break out and become a global megastar. \u201cJames Corden has done it, Ed Sheeran has done it and, to a lesser extent, Matt Goss has done it.\u201d You will perhaps not be surprised to hear that the US isn\u2019t quite ready for Keith Lemon. A Los Angeles focus group, shown a compilation of Celebrity Juice clips, is unanimously horrified. A Hollywood cosmetic surgeon tells him he needs $21,000 (\u00a316,000) worth of work. Emma Stone\u2019s people are not getting back to him. I am aware that Lemon divides opinion, between those who dislike him and those who hate him. Many people are mystified by his unabating popularity, but not me. I\u2019ll say this quietly: I think he is funny. I can\u2019t help it \u2013 it\u2019s not something I\u2019m in control of. When he opens his mouth, I laugh. I laugh at his hats, his walk, his uncomprehending eyes, the sheer unrelenting awfulness of him, so fiercely and unapologetically inhabited. I love Through the Keyhole. I wish I could maintain there were complex subversive forces at play in order to justify my view, but that would be a lie. There is, however, a weird purity to Lemon, and something about it tickles my fancy. Such is my weakness for Lemon that I\u2019m tempted to recuse myself from judging this latest effort. I can see that on many levels, it is pretty terrible \u2013 an unfocused, by-the-numbers affair, the kind of thing you have seen many times before, but this time with Keith Lemon in it. His quest for fame and fortune is punctuated by a series of sketches that range from slapdash to downright ill-advised (the best thing about the spoof travelogue David Dickinson Fuckin\u2019 Loves an Holiday is the title). It is vulgar in a scattershot sort of way \u2013 Lemon says of his new Hollywood agent: \u201cI\u2019m banking on her to fast-track me t\u2019top.\u201d It is also a cast-iron, bulletproof formula. This is exactly the sort of low-rent, stitches-showing reality mess Lemon would make if you let him. It is hard to imagine a better fit between character and vehicle: Keith Lemon failing, and doing it badly. \u201cIn England, I have a reputation for being quite irrelevant,\u201d he tells his agent. Lemon is no longer simply a satire of moronic, self-regarding, D-list celebrity. He is a D-list celebrity \u2013 riding around in a hired limo, wearing a wrist bandage colour-coordinated to match his outfit, trying to lure other D-listers to his welcome-to-Hollywood party. \u201cSteve Guttenberg says he\u2019s gonna come,\u201d he says. The celebrities he does manage to wrangle seem happy enough to send themselves up, to let on that they know they are the sort of celeb who would be hanging out with Keith Lemon. He preys upon the hospitality of former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts. He goes bowling with Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who is obliged to acknowledge shouts of \u201cYou\u2019re the man!\u201d from fellow bowlers. \u201cDid he just call you the mayor?\u201d says Lemon. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s becoming hard to tell the difference between low-wattage celebrity and its parody. It\u2019s that there is no difference. How can Lemon be a parody in a world where Piers Morgan isn\u2019t? If he is taking the piss out of anything, it\u2019s ITV2. Anyway, who cares? I laughed. I laughed when he said to the plastic surgeon: \u201cIf I lifted my nipples up, would they still work?\u201d Even the surgeon laughed at that. I\u2019m not going to try to build a case for this show, or for Keith \u2013 you will already know exactly what you\u2019re getting. If you think he\u2019s funny, there is more than enough here for you to enjoy. If you think he\u2019s the least funny thing ever to appear on our screens, then I respect your opinion. In fact, I respect it slightly more than I respect mine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
