Sutton has resigned to take up a new post abroad and will leave around the same time as the picture editor, Clare Wood, who is leaving the News of the World to pursue a career outside newspapers. The editor, Andy Coulson, has made several changes to his staff, including the assistant editor features, Gary Thompson, who becomes associate editor (news and pictures). The assistant editor, Greg Miskiw, is moving to Manchester to oversee the paper's news operation in the north, while Paul Ashton has been promoted to chief photographer with immediate effect. It is the biggest shake-up at the News of the World since Coulson became editor in January. His most high-profile signing so far has been the former People editor, Neil Wallis, who was poached to become Coulson's deputy in February. Thompson's first task will be to recruit replacements for Sutton and Wood. Thompson and Miskiw will take up their new roles on December 8. Sutton is expected to take up a post in Australia. \"He's passionate about surfing,\" said one colleague. He joined from the Sunday mirror as a reporter and has been at the News of the World for eight years. Miskiw already has family in his new base at Manchester. In a further appointment, Richard Rushworth will become acting head of production in January following the retirement of John Mellodew. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
