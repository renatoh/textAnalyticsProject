The statement 3-0 defeat of Norway in the quarter-finals on Thursday ensured England have matched their progress at the last tournament in Canada under Mark Sampson, when they finished third after losing to Japan in the last four. But with the match being screened live in front of thousands of fans at Glastonbury festival and a total of 7.6 million people having watched the win over Norway in Le Havre on TV, Moore is hoping the England players will be inspired to reach the final this time. \u201cIt was hard when we were in Canada because we were sheltered far, far away,\u201d said the Reading midfielder. \u201cFrance is right on our doorstep and we feel it a lot more. There\u2019s a lot more of a social media presence now so we can dip in and dip out if we want to and see what is happening at home. It definitely makes a difference and this is where we want to push women\u2019s football, we want it to be spoken about in pubs, backyards and by anybody and anyone. We are glad this is happening and we do definitely get to feel what is happening at home and it spurs us on.\u201d There is a feeling that, having reached the semi-finals once more, this could be a game-changing moment. Total television reach for the tournament so far is 22.2 million \u2013 dwarfing the 12.4 million record set by the World Cup in Canada. Whisper it, but the possibility of 10 million watching BBC One on Tuesday night for the showpiece semi-final is real. The relief of having matched their result from 2015 and the 2017 European Championship, where Sampson\u2019s side lost in the last four to the Netherlands, is palpable. Now, the pressure is off. They have a real chance. But just reaching this semi-final ensures there is no going backwards. And the interest in England is reinforcing the players\u2019 determination to make a difference. \u201cWe want to make sure there are young girls running around school playing football with girls\u2019 names like McManus, Williamson on the back of their shirt, rather than it being \u2018Rooney, Ronaldo\u2019,\u201d said the Manchester City defender Abbie McManus. \u201cWe want to make a stand where women\u2019s football is changing and I think we are on the right road to do that. The \u2018badass women\u2019 comment that Phil and Leah have both made is something that we\u2019re working towards. There\u2019s a long, long way to go. It\u2019s not just us that need to fight this. It\u2019s parents getting girls involved in sports, it\u2019s them seeing it on TV rather than just seeing male players. It\u2019s an exciting time to lead and empower. We want people to know that we\u2019re not just fighting for ourselves but for young girls as well.\u201d Moore echoed her teammate\u2019s sentiments, but also said the very nature of a tournament bubble means they will not fully feel the effects of the mood change until they step off the plane on home soil. \u201cIt\u2019s really the reaction we feel once we get home, seeing the changes and what happens, the turning points that we probably don\u2019t see because we are in it, doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see when we get home the things that change and get put in place to make little girls want to play football and the opportunities that are around a lot more. To see the platform change from when we grew up to what kids have now.\u201d Reaching the final would take the momentum to the next level. For Nikita Parris, who has been backed by Neville to take the next penalty despite her two misses, there is the chance to get another feel for the turf she will tread next season, having signed for the French champions this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling that I\u2019ll be playing on a pitch that I\u2019ll be playing on a lot next season,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited; I\u2019ve worked so hard for this moment. We don\u2019t talk about it a lot but we\u2019ve suffered at times throughout this World Cup journey over the last two years but we\u2019re here now and we have to absolutely dominate going forward. \u201cWe have to be even more dangerous. The likes of France or the USA are not going to give up a semi-final easily and neither will we, so we\u2019ll be battling away.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
