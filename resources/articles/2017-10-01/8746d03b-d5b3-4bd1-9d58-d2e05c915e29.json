The House of Commons\u2019 Treasury select committee, which Morgan chairs, will next week launch an investigation into the system of student loans, a subject transformed into a major political issue by the steeply rising levels of debt carried by graduates after leaving university. Morgan\u2019s inquiry comes after Theresa May announced changes to funding and repayments for undergraduates in England, by freezing tuition fees at their full-time level of \u00a39,250 a year and raising the income level that triggers graduate repayments from \u00a321,000 a year to \u00a325,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that the changes will shift the cost of higher education by \u00a32.3bn a year from graduates to taxpayers, with 83% of recent graduates unlikely to repay their income-contingent loans in full. \u201cStudent loan debt is projected to be around \u00a3160bn within six years, and the government has announced that it will review the whole student finance system. The committee will scrutinise the current system and any future developments closely,\u201d said Morgan. The Treasury committee is to scrutinise the recent changes to student loans, including the repayment thresholds, interest rates, level of tuition fees and the impact on student finances. But the committee will also look at more controversial areas, including the viability of a graduate tax to replace the loans system, as well as the government\u2019s plans to manage and eventually sell its stock of student loans. In her speech to the Conservative party in Manchester conference this month, May pledged to take action on student debt and to \u201cundertake a major review of university funding and student financing\u201d. But since then there have been no details of a review taking place. The inquiry was backed by the Russell Group of leading research universities. Tim Bradshaw, the group\u2019s acting director, said: \u201cI have previously called for the interest rate attached to student loans to be looked at again and am pleased that this will be considered by the committee.\u201d The system introduced since 2012 means undergraduates take out loans of \u00a39,250 per year for tuition fees, and maintenance loans of up to \u00a38,400 a year for students living away from home outside of London (and \u00a311,000 in London). Graduates have to pay interest on the debt while studying and after graduation, of up to 6.1% based on income. But they only have to make repayments worth 9% of their income above \u00a325,000, while those who earn less than \u00a325,000 pay nothing. Any debt or interest remaining unpaid 30 years after graduation is written off by the government, leading the system\u2019s supporters to argue that the funding does not strictly qualify as debt or loans. The Treasury committee\u2019s first hearing will be held on Wednesday. The inquiry will run alongside similar hearings being run by the House of Lords\u2019 economic affairs committee, which will hear evidence from Martin Lewis, the personal finance guru, on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
