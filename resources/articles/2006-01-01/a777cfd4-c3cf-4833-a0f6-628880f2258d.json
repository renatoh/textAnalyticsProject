It may cost a fortune, but at least in your retirement you'll be able to extract cash out of it to pay for your old age. Bricks and mortar are safe as houses, while traditional stock market-based pensions are a waste of money. Really? Equity release will not be the safety net that so many people are counting on. What few realise is that the maths just do not add up. No wonder Which? recently condemned equity release as the \"last resort\" for pensioners. This week we put the main equity release products through a consumer test, and the results are frightening. A \"reversion\" plan will grab nearly 60% of the value of your home if you want to release 25% of its value in cash at retirement. Do the same with a standard equity release plan, and it will eat up the entire value of your home after 20 years. There is only one cheap and easy way to release value from your house: sell it. Take out some equity, trade down, and use the cash as you please - without some financial institution hovering over you. Before embarking on any financial scheme, always ask yourself how many mouths it is going to feed. In an equity release scheme, you will pay commission to an adviser, the cost of a solicitor, fees to a lender, plus the rolled-up interest. That's a lot of mouths to feed. By simply selling the home and buying somewhere cheaper, the only mouth you are feeding is your own. But what is extraordinary is how few retired people are willing to trade down, however sensible such a move can be. Survey after survey reveals that pensioners want to stay in their homes until they are carried out in a box. The reasons are understandable - emotional attachments, a sense of community, knowledge of the local area - but they are not overwhelming. In recent decades, property has become a fetish. Over the next few decades, we will build a colossal, expensive and unnecessary equity release industry to allow people to remain in their homes way past any rational reason for doing so. At the same time, we will force first-time buyers into ever tinier starter homes, and ask the same hard-pressed young families to subsidise the council tax of elderly single pensioners in big, under-used properties. Nothing, of course, can or should be done to stop people staying in their homes for as long as they wish. But they are foolhardy to view equity release as the pain-free way to finance it. Come clean and spare the banks' blushes Some readers will have little sympathy for our tale of \"irresponsible lending\". We highlight how a man earning just \u00a3600-\u00a3700 a month was given personal loans adding up to \u00a3100,000. The repayments cost \u00a31,500 a month. But it's not a cut-and-dry story of greedy banks throwing people into impossible debts. After all, the man concerned admits he lied about his income on some of the loan application forms. He is extraordinarily fortunate that the banks have now decided to write off all his loans. What this story reveals is not so much bank greed as sheer idiocy. We all have extensive, in-depth records of our credit worthiness held on the giant credit reference agency databases. Even the supermarkets track every purchase and profile our every move though loyalty cards. Yet the banks don't seem to know if another bank has lent you money. And nine out of 10 borrowers are given credit cards without the lenders carrying out any checks to verify the individual can afford to repay the debt. To be fair, the banks' hands may be tied on data sharing. But if the banks knew that little bit more about you, that would be a small price to pay to avoid worsening multiple-debt problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
