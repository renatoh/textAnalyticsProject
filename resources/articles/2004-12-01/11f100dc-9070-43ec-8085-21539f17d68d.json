I say \"I think\" because you would never have guessed it from yesterday's sports pages. That barometer of the nation, the Sun, led with some nonsense about Chelsea striker Didier Drogba saying title rivals Arsenal were \"running scared\". The build-up to the Arsenal v Chelsea clash (\"Judgment Day\") covered three pages. The Mirror, too, had its eyes fixed firmly on the \"Highbury Showdown\". There was coverage of Williams's fight with the Ukrainian Vitali Klitschko if you looked hard enough, but it was merely dutiful. The real passion was reserved for Harry Redknapp's feud with his former club Portsmouth, and Liverpool's battle to keep midfield star Steven Gerrard. The sports editors know that, in the race with football, boxing is a non-starter. The king of sports was dethroned long ago. Thirty years ago, a Briton in with a chance of winning the world heavyweight title would have been a nation-stopping sporting event. The left hook with which Henry Cooper floored Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) in 1963 is an iconic sporting moment - an echo from a time when boxing had cultural resonance. To a large extent, professional boxing has only itself to blame for its decline. The story is a familiar one - a multiplicity of titles confusing the public, promoters' greed, too many meaningless fights, too many fights where a victory for the \"home\" fighter was virtually guaranteed, the best fighters avoiding each other until sheer weight of money made a fight inevitable. The oddity in the story is that, in its heyday between the wars, boxing was openly corrupt. In one instance, the brilliant American sportswriter Paul Gallico traced the way in which Primo Carnera went all the way to the world heavyweight title through a series of fixed fights. \"Carnera's first big fight in New York involved him with a lanky Swede named Big Boy Peterson,\" wrote Gallico. \"Eventually, Peterson succumbed to a push as Carnera lumbered and floundered past him, and to make assurance doubly sure, the Swede hit himself a punch on the jaw as he went down. Someone had to hit him.\" The interesting question is why such blatant corruption - which, if you believe that Sonny Liston took a dive in his first title fight with Ali in 1964, continued long after the war - didn't undermine the centrality of the sport. Sports fans somehow factored it into their love of boxing, while sports writers such as Gallico were able to construct a narrative embracing both Mob corruption and the dignity of fighters. The workaday financial imperatives of the later age, with \"match-making\" replacing \"fight-fixing\", proved more insidious. \"Honest corruption\" was replaced by men in suits calling the shots and invent ing meaningless titles to sell to TV audiences who quickly saw through the charade. Ali singlehandedly (or, rather, doublehandedly) preserved boxing's aura for 20 years; Cooper's honest endeavours made him a hero in Britain; Tyson fought his corner in the battle with the emerging football gods for a little longer. But the knockout was coming. Professional boxing is now, if not down and out, certainly taking a standing count. Yesterday, the Daily Telegraph's sports section put its preview of the Williams fight at the back, just above the amateur golf. On the front, though, was a story that has become all too characteristic: Tyson was up in a court for allegedly beating up a white Toyota Solora outside the Pussycat Lounge in Scottsdale, Arizona. But all may not be lost for boxing. Sports wax and wane: rowing was one of Britain's earliest professional sports, then suffered a long eclipse, but is now making news again. The football bubble will burst - happily, sports that give themselves up entirely to money eventually implode. The cult that has developed around amateur boxer Amir Khan, who won a silver for Britain at the Athens Olympics, suggests that a residual interest and belief in boxing remain. Amateur boxing - with its shorter rounds, headguards, transparent points system and tempering of the money motive - could be the salvation of boxing. Promoter Frank Warren is already talking of putting amateur and professional fights on the same card. A new formula for the sweet science. One that might even mean that a potential British world champion means more than Harry Redknapp's eternally problematic relationships with his club chairmen. stephen.moss@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
