The decision came after the woman\u2019s mother, a former midwife, challenged a court order issued on Friday. The appeal court judges Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Jackson said they would give reasons for their decision at a later date. Earlier, the Catholic church had described the court order as \u201csad and distressing\u201d. On Friday, the court of protection in London decided an abortion was in the best interests of the woman, who is in her 20s, and is 22 weeks pregnant. She has the mental capacity of a six- to nine-year-old child. Justice Nathalie Lieven, who made the original ruling, described it as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, saying: \u201cI am acutely conscious of the fact that for the state to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn\u2019t want it is an immense intrusion.\u201d But, she added, she had to act in the woman\u2019s \u201cbest interests, not on society\u2019s views of termination\u201d. The NHS trust that is caring for the woman had sought the court\u2019s permission for doctors to terminate the pregnancy. Three specialists, an obstetrician and two psychiatrists, said a termination was the best option because of the risk to the woman\u2019s psychiatric health if pregnancy continued. Both the woman and her mother were opposed to the abortion, and the woman\u2019s mother had offered to care for the child. A social worker who works with the woman said the pregnancy should continue. The court was told last week that the woman had a \u201cmoderately severe\u201d learning disorder and a mood disorder. The judge said she was not sure the woman understood what having a baby meant. \u201cI think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,\u201d Lieven said. The woman may suffer more if the baby was born and then fostered or adopted than if the abortion was carried out, the judge said in the earlier ruling. She \u201cwould suffer greater trauma from having a baby removed. It would at that stage be a real baby,\u201d she added. The judge also suggested the woman\u2019s mother may return to her home country at some point. At the appeal court hearing, John McKendrick QC, representing the woman\u2019s mother, argued that Lieven\u2019s analysis of what was in the woman\u2019s best interests was flawed. \u201cThere is a clear overall view of a young woman who wishes to have a baby,\u201d he told the court. Earlier on Monday, before the appeal court\u2019s decision, John Sherrington, a bishop in the Catholic diocese of Westminster, said: \u201cForcing a woman to have an abortion against her will, and that of her close family, infringes her human rights, not to mention the right of her unborn child to life in a family that has committed to caring for this child. \u201cIn a free society like ours there is a delicate balance between the rights of the individual and the powers of the state.\u201d He added: \u201cThis case, for which all the information is not available, raises serious questions about the meaning of \u2018best interests\u2019 when a patient lacks mental capacity and is subject to the court\u2019s decision against her will.\u201d At the earlier hearing, the judge was told that the circumstances of the conception were unclear and a police investigation was continuing. Under Britain\u2019s 1967 Abortion Act, abortions can be performed up to the 24th week of pregnancy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
