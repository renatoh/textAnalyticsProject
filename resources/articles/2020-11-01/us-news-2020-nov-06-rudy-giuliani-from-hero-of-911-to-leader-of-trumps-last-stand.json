He wanted someone like James Baker, the New York Times reported, the former White House chief of staff, Treasury secretary and secretary of state, who led George W Bush\u2019s legal team during the Florida recount in 2000 in a role that won him praise as a strategic and diplomatic genius. He got Rudy Giuliani. A fortnight ago, Giuliani was angrily defending himself after a clip from the new Borat film showed him apparently fiddling with his crotch as he lay on the bed in a hotel room where he had gone for a drink with a young woman who was posing as a Kazakh television journalist. \u201cI was tucking in my shirt,\u201d he explained later. He denied any wrongdoing and described the footage as \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d. Now the president\u2019s personal attorney is accusing his opponents of being \u201can embarrassment to our reputation throughout the world\u201d and leading Trump\u2019s last stand, helming the legal effort to keep Joe Biden out of the White House. On Wednesday afternoon he tweeted that he was \u201cen route to Philadelphia with legal team\u201d to challenge what he called \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 \u201cmassive cheating\u201d. Since then, six of his tweets have been flagged by Twitter as containing misleading information. At a press conference on Thursday, he gave a speech in which he claimed \u2013 again without providing evidence - that one person could have voted 100,000 times. Giuliani, with no neck and a pocket square, declared his interest in launching a nebulous \u201cnational lawsuit\u201d to challenge the results. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re stupid?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re fools?\u201d His attempts to keep Trump in the White House, if they result in failure as most experts seem to think they will, may mark some sort of end point for the 76-year-old Giuliani, once a fearless criminal prosecutor and hero of 9/11 who few people disputed had earned his honorary knighthood and the title of America\u2019s Mayor. Three months after the twin towers fell, he completed his term in New York and embarked on a highly lucrative career on the speaking circuit, commanding as much as $200,000 per engagement, for each of which his contract demanded transportation in the form of a private jet that \u201cMUST BE a Gulfstream IV or bigger\u201d. Over the next six years he brought in about $30m, was a member of 11 country clubs and had six homes. A run at the presidency seemed the next obvious step. But after a vastly expensive campaign for the Republican nomination ended with just a single delegate to his name, something shifted in public perceptions of Giuliani, perhaps nudged along by Biden\u2019s timeless summary on the campaign trail: \u201cThere\u2019s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11.\u201d Giuliani never forgot that slight, it is said. Those closest to him noticed a change, too. Judith Nathan, his third ex-wife, told New York magazine in 2018 that the end of their marriage was \u201can ongoing process that began when he lost the presidential campaign. For a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse, he has become a different man.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency offered a chance at reinvention, and Giuliani secured for himself a role that Chris Christie, formerly a Trump confidante himself, summarised as \u201cfirst friend\u201d. When the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about sexual assault came out, surrogates and supporters began to melt away. Only Giuliani was prepared to defend him, appearing on every one of the five prominent Sunday morning talkshows that set the US political agenda. \u201cThis is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn\u2019t sinned, throw the first stone here,\u201d he said. Steve Bannon, then Trump\u2019s chief strategist, later described his role as indispensable. \u201cOne of the reasons we won is Rudy was there 24/7,\u201d Bannon says. \u201cRudy was hardcore. He\u2019s like a honey badger. \u201d Giuliani was denied the reward he coveted as secretary of state, instead settling definitively into Trump\u2019s personal orbit as his fixer and fireman, wholly reconciled to the accompanying loss of dignity. In 1993, when the New York Times called him a \u201cjutjawed lawman\u201d whose \u201ccultural and psychic sensibilities froze in about 1961\u201d, he refused to let Trump buy him breakfast for fear of an appearance of impropriety. By 2019, he was acting as the president\u2019s unpaid personal attorney, a gift that went undeclared. He has also advised the president on the legality of his \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and as a \u201ccybersecurity adviser\u201d. Most notorious was his leading role in Trump\u2019s attempt to dredge up a scandal about the Biden family in Ukraine \u2013 a role that led career diplomats to accuse him during the impeachment hearings of conducting a \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d. He has appeared in ads for Cigar Aficionado magazine and seen his own daughter endorse Biden. Assuming the failure of his so far eccentric legal representations, he now looks bound for a return to the peanut gallery. If such a welcome is all that is left to him in the city he once led, how will he feel? Relaxed, he has claimed. \u201cMy attitude about my legacy is \u2018fuck it\u2019,\u201d he said last year. In any case, he insists, he will be remembered fondly in the end. \u201cI will be the hero,\u201d he said during the Ukraine affair. \u2018These morons \u2013 when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
