Sneaked out quietly in a written answer to the House of Lords on Monday, the end of British support for search and rescue operations in the southern Mediterranean reeks suspiciously of Australia\u2019s \u201cstop the boats\u201d solution. Confirming the UK\u2019s withdrawal, the new Foreign Office minister, Lady Anelay, highlighted an \u201cunintended pull factor\u201d\u2019 of search and rescue: \u201cthat it encourages more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing, thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths\u201d. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Yes Siree. Yet again, the British Conservatives \u2013 equally seduced a few years ago by Australia\u2019s tough, points based immigration system \u2013 have filched policy from their former colony (and major migrant outpost) \u2013 to score a few cheap, political points in the year before a tough election. And yet this is the very same nation that has long prided itself on being a beacon of multiculturalism, of tolerance and of civil society. This is the same country that sells its capital, London, as a global hub, a melting pot of nations where more than a third of residents \u2013 or about 2.5m - are foreign born and pretty much everyone rubs along nicely together. In 2014 in the UK, there are an estimated 270 nationalities and 300 languages spoken. Throughout the country, immigrants are essential to the workforce and in all industries, from finance, IT and banking to restaurants, childcare, hospitality and cleaning. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has said loudly \u2013 and proudly \u2013 he is pro-immigration, if rhetorically tough on illegal arrivals. Still, Johnson advocates more empathy than political brutality: \u201cI believe that when talented people have something to offer a society and a community they should be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d And what happened to the British prime minister, David Cameron\u2019s flagship project, the What Works Network? It was a pioneering, gutsy and laudable campaign to apply the principle that \u201cgood decision-making should be informed by the best available evidence on both what works and what does not work.\u201d The Cabinet Office proudly announced last year that What Works was a world first: \u201cit\u2019s the first time any government has taken a national approach to prioritising the use of evidence in decision-making.\u201d So where is the evidence? Where is the proof that Australia\u2019s now globally notorious towback policies \u2013 illustrated in the \u201cno way you will make Australia home\u201d posters \u2013 actually work? Those who should know \u2013 the naval, medical and social welfare officers who work at the coalface in the southern Mediterranean \u2013 have reacted with unanimous horror. It was exactly a year ago, just a few days after more than 300 people drowned off the coast of Lampedusa, that Italy launched the Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) operation to ensure search and rescue of migrants between North Africa and southern Italy. Since then, the operation is estimated to have saved around 150,000 lives. \u201cEveryone was horrified at the loss of lives off Lampedusa one year ago. Italy did something about it\u201d said the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), Michael Diedring. Vincent Cochetel, director of the UNHCR Bureau for Europe, said that \u201cending Mare Nostrum without a European search and rescue operation to replace it would place more people at risk\u201d. On Tuesday, Italy\u2019s Admiral Filippo Foffi categorically dismissed the idea that Mare Nostrum has created a pull factor: \u201cIf someone is talking about pull factors, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he is speaking about,\u201d he said, adding that that many refugees\u2019 journeys start more than three months before they make it to the shores of Libya and northern Africa with the majority enduring hardships that meant an estimated half die before reaching the coast. Despite pressure from the country\u2019s political right, Foffi urged EU member states to consider conducting joint-operations further out in international waters where most rescues take place and where criminals are more active. \u201cIf we are only in territorial waters we won\u2019t see people in danger and if they die we won\u2019t see it,\u201d he warned. No sane person would argue that there isn\u2019t an urgent need for affected nations to explore alternatives to the dangerous, life threatening voyages offered by traffickers to desperate people fleeing for their lives. However what seems to have been lost in the political fray \u2013 sadly, in both hemispheres now \u2013 is the credo of a civil society that enshrines that seeking asylum is not illegal. It is a human right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
