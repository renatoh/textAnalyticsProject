In the immediate aftermath of the deadly shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump said there was a clear need for \u201cintelligent background checks\u201d and indicated he was willing to use his power to push his party to pass \u201cvery meaningful\u201d legislation. But after conversations from officials with the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Republican lawmakers, Trump has returned to familiar conservative talking points, focusing on the need to keep guns away from the mentally ill and insisting that the US already has \u201cvery strong\u201d background laws in place. \u201cWe have very, very strong background checks right now,\u201d Trump said during an exchange with reporters at the White House on Tuesday. \u201cA lot of the people who put me where I am are strong supporters of the second amendment.\u201d Echoing a familiar talking point used by the NRA to blunt calls for tightening the nation\u2019s gun laws, Trump warned of a \u201cslippery slope\u201d that could lead to a situation where \u201ceverything gets taken away\u201d. \u201cYou approve one thing, and that leads to a lot of bad things,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d The Atlantic reported on Tuesday that Trump called the NRA CEO, Wayne LaPierre, on Tuesday afternoon to tell him that any push for legislation to expand requirements for background checks on gun sales was off the table. Trump has previously suggested Congress do more to prevent gun violence. After 17 students and teachers were killed in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida last year, Trump suggested Congress should bring forward stricter background checks legislation. But then, as he is doing now, he backed away from the issue amid pushback from the NRA and Republicans. Trump is wary of any action that might hurt his support among conservative voters as he faces re-election with weak poll numbers and amid warnings of an economic recession. Democrats have called on the Senate to return to Washington and vote on legislation passed by the House that would expand background checks for gun purchases. Members of the House judiciary committee will return early from Congress\u2019s summer recess to consider a slate of gun control measures, including a bill that would ban high-capacity magazines; a bill that would prohibit people convicted of a misdemeanor hate crimes from owning a weapon; and a third bill that would encourage states to adopt so-called red flag laws that would allow court officials to temporarily remove guns from a person deemed to be a danger to themselves or the public. Trump declined to comment on those measures, but insisted that he was in a \u201cvery meaningful discussion\u201d with Democrats, who he called \u201cnot strong at all on the second amendment\u201d. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he will allow a \u201cserious discussion\u201d on the subject after Congress returns from recess in September. Polling consistently shows an overwhelming majority of Americans \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 support expanding background checks to include all gun purchases. A Fox News survey found that 89% of registered Republican voters favor universal background checks and 3 in 4 Republicans support red flag laws. Despite widespread support for such measures, Republican lawmakers remain reluctant to take action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
