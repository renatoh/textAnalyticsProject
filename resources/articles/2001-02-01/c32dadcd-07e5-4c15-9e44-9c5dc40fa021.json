Their manager Gary Megson was a firm adherent to the \"one for all\" team ethic as a player and has instilled the same belief at the club. However, as Hughes was granted the freedom of Selhurst Park by a defensive line bereft of the Chinese international Fan Zhiyi and Hayden Mullins (and marshalled by the experienced, yet ever slowing Neil Ruddock), his prominence was inevitable. He struck the visitors' equaliser - his 18th goal of the season - and could have completed a hat-trick if the Palace keeper Aleksandrs Kolinko and a post had not denied him. Even when Des Lyttle looked to have pushed Hughes from the headlines with a 63rd-minute winner, the striker was there again. This time, though, he prevented a goal by apparently impeding Kolinko's vision from an offside position. Lyttle, a true team man, refused to blame Hughes for denying him his second goal of the season and West Brom a thoroughly deserved victory. \"I thought Hughesy was nowhere near the goalkeeper. I think the linesman got it wrong,\" he said. He added that his side's ability to recover from a two-goal deficit was further evidence that they are far from a one-man show. \"We've got goals coming from everywhere. We've got Foxy [Ruel Fox], Richard Sneekes, who scored today, and Michael Appleton who can score too,\" Lyttle said. Appleton, a combative midfielder making his second appearance, seems to have a rosy future at the Hawthorns. The centre-back Matt Carbon, however, may not, after the former Derby man failed to travel to south London without his manager's permission. Megson ominously decreed that the matter would be \"discussed internally\". With Tony Butler also missing from West Brom's defence, Daryl Burgess started his first game this season. Burgess, a former club captain, set the precedent for the day's defending by gifting Mikael Forssell his 10th league goal of the season. Forssell, on loan at Selhurst Park from Chelsea, has impressed the Palace manager Alan Smith this season and is likely to be offered an opportunity to stay for another year. The Finnish international, however, may be less impressed by the prospect after he watched his team-mates allow the two-goal head-start that he and Jamie Pollock had given them to be surrendered so meekly. \"I have two years left on my contract at Chelsea so, at the end of the season, we'll see,\" he said. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
