It had not been hard to find. Expatriates in Saudi Arabia earned generous tax-free packages, lived in air-conditioned apartments and formed a 'bubble world' quite separate from the rich but austere Saudi kingdom around them. Beneath the veil of public purity there was booze as well as sex. Large supplies of illicit alcohol were easy to come by and Westerners were willing to pay over the odds for a shot of their favourite tipple. Rich Saudis also frequented the pubs, one of the most famous of which was the Celtic Corner. Several of the first arrests, including that of Sandy Mitchell, who faced the death penalty, had links to this bar and the compound it stood on. And it provided the Saudis with their ready-made excuse that the bombings were the work of rival gangs of Western booze bootleggers. Speculation is now rife about the deals that were cut to secure the release of the six Britons who returned home on Friday - trade in arms and oil have always been at the heart of Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia and relatives of the freed men believe the Foreign Office's 'softly softly' approach was motivated by a fear of destabilising this lucrative relationship. But it is now clear that the release of the men, though officially thanks to the clemency of the aged and bed-ridden King Fahd, is far more likely to be part of a desperate Saudi public relations exercise to distance itself from al-Qaeda. A Saudi security source talking to The Observer on condition of anonymity said the Ministry of the Interior had finally recognised that its evidence against the British men 'was not watertight' after pressure from Crown Prince Abdullah to release the men. It is believed Abdullah made promises to Tony Blair at the Evian summit in June to release the men by the end of the summer. Now the Interior Ministry has to look elsewhere for its suspects - a terrifying prospect in a country which has always refused to admit it has a problem with internal Islamist dissent. One man who has clearly been central to negotiations is Prince Turki al-Faisal, former head of the feared Saudi intelligence service and, since last year, the kingdom's ambassador in London. Mai Yamani of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and herself a Saudi said Faisal's appointment had been central to a huge PR operation launched by the kingdom in the light of increased international hostility to the regime. 'It was very important for [Prince Turki] and one of the first things he wanted to solve,' she said. 'It has gained him some public relations points.' In November, 2000, when a blast killed Christopher Rodway, a 47-year-old hospital engineer, and injured his wife, Jane, it was clear that the expat dream was over and that the Islamist war on the House of al-Saud had begun in earnest. Six days later, a second bomb exploded under the car of a group returning from one of the main underground drinking clubs operating in expatriates' residential compounds. In a regime paranoid about the existence of a domestic Islamic militant threat, the explosions sent shockwaves through the authorities. The answer was simple and wilful denial. The bombs were not the work of terrorists, the authorities announced, they were the work of Western alcohol gangs. In February 2001, Mitchell, Bill Sampson and a Belgian, Raf Schyvens, appeared on Saudi television, looking dazed, to 'confess' to the two bombings. James Lee, James Cottle and Les Walker made similar television confessions the following August. The final Briton to be arrested, Glenn Ballard, was arrested only 10 months ago. He was never charged. The men had been tortured. They had been kept in solitary confinement, beaten and had their families threatened. They had never seen lawyers and when sentences were passed on them, they were not even aware they were in court. That did not stop the Saudi authorities handing out the severest of penalties. Mitchell and Sampsonwere sentenced to death. The others got sentences of between 12 and 18 years. Right from the start the men were abandoned by both the Saudi authorities and the British government. The Saudis could not back down from their claims even as the bombings continued. They could not afford to lose face. The British were hamstrung by their enormous commercial interests in Saudi Arabia and the growing crisis in Iraq. The men really owe their freedom to the suicide bombers who so brutally struck in Riyadh earlier this year, killing dozens of Westerners and locals at residential compounds in the capital. The carnage was so widespread that the Saudi insistence that they had no domestic terror problems faded away like the desert mirage it always was. From that moment onwards, the men's freedom was back in play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
