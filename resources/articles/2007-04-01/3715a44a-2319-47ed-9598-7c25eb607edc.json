A side that had appeared doomed to slip into the Championship at the season's midway point stretched their unbeaten run to six games last night, though a sense of exasperation still festered in this arena at the final whistle. This was a missed opportunity and, at the season's end, the fear lingers that the point gleaned may not have proved sufficient. Progress effectively stalled here, the home side were increasingly gripped by nerves as the game lurched on with Reading always the slicker and more coherent side. The Chinese midfielder Zheng Zhi guided a header straight at Marcus Hahnemann in stoppage time but, by then, desperation had sunk in. Alan Pardew has produced something of a miracle since taking up the reins, with 20 points secured from his 14 games, but Charlton hover a point above the cut-off this morning. Optimists will argue that their destiny is in their own hands, particularly with Sheffield United due at The Valley later this month. Pessimists would suggest this was another home game passed up by a team with only one away victory to their name all season. \"I don't think we were ever favourites to stay up and I certainly think we've still got a great chance,\" said Pardew in the aftermath. \"Someone mentioned to me that Charlton had never won four successive home games in the Premiership. That was what we were trying to achieve tonight but, if we were going to draw one game, I'd rather it was this one than either of the two we still have left. There was a lot anxiety and tension out there, but I think the disruption affected us more than anything.\" The hosts' rhythm had been fractured by the departure of Hermann Hreidarsson and Marcus Bent before the half-hour with hamstring injuries which will render them highly doubtful for the trip to Goodison Park at the weekend. Charlton's prospects may have been damaged further had Graham Poll dismissed Alexandre Song for a horrible lunge on the excellent Steve Sidwell 15 minutes in. Steve Coppell described it as \"very agricultural at best\". Pardew spoke with the official at the interval and asked him to indicate in the second half if Song's ill-discipline was threatening a second yellow card. \"As it was, Graham sent me that signal - he gave me a 'look' - and Alex had to come off,\" said the Charlton manager, who hauled the Arsenal loanee off the field after 69 minutes. \"Full credit to Graham. No one wants to see a team go down to 10 men and if there was communication like that between managers and referees the game would be better for it. I just asked him to let me know if Alex was getting close [to a second yellow]. I don't think there's an issue with that.\" Reading, potentially denied the opportunity to take on 10 men, may disagree and it was ironic that the Charlton fans, none the wiser, booed Poll in the latter stages when their team was labouring. Unsurprisingly, the hosts' best opportunity had been chiselled early, Talal El Karkouri leaping to plant a header from Darren Ambrose's free-kick on to the underside of the crossbar. The ball bounced down in the goalmouth, but there was no doubt it had not crossed the line. Thereafter, there were plenty of neat moves, a neat combination of passes between Luke Young, Zheng and Song culminating in the full-back forcing Hahnemann to save, but confidence seeped away as the chances became more infrequent. Darren Bent and Zheng went close early in the second period but, long before the end, the threat had passed to Reading. Coppell's side have now failed to win in six Premiership games, but they arguably deserved better here. In Sidwell they boasted the contest's most impressive player. Reading's wingers had the time and space down either flank, spreading panic at the heart of the home side's defence. Sidwell should have converted at least twice from presentable opportunities on the edge of the area. Nicky Shorey fizzed another shot wide, while Seol Ki-Hyeon, fed by Sidwell's wonderful flick with the outside of his right foot, raced from inside his own half - with Charlton players parting obligingly - before battering a shot which Scott Carson did well to paw away. When Stephen Hunt slapped a header wide at the far post from Ulises de la Cruz's centre, Reading realised their winless run was to be prolonged. For Charlton, a point clear of the drop zone, tenser times remain ahead. \"There was huge expectation for my players to deal with,\" said Pardew. \"But let's take stock. We're on a terrific run, there's no looking back. Let's look forward to the next one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
