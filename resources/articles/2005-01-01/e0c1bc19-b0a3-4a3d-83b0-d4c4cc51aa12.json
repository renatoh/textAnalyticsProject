The European commission's humanitarian office (Echo) committed funds - not just pledged - immediately to the Red Cross and the UN. The European Civil Protection Mechanism has been coordinating efforts across the affected areas, and Echo staff have worked around the clock since the disaster occurred. Assessment and evaluation continue to take place in Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and Somalia. The UN remains the global coordinator, but the EU has a clear and defined role supporting its efforts. The commission will be funding the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to strengthen its work. Up until now, the EC and member states have committed \u20ac240m, and this figure is certain to increase after the UN's final assessment, and the global appeal is launched on January 11 in Geneva. Without doubt, future funding will require additional resources from the EU's emergency reserve, which stands at \u20ac200m. I support a proposal for a donor conference in Brussels in order to prepare for the essential work that will need to take place after the period of emergency relief. Glenys Kinnock, MEP Lab, Wales US and UK aid is often tied to conditions that have seriously negative consequences on poor people, democracy and the environment. Aid (and debt relief) are used to force crippling policies on developing countries, such as the privatisation of water, land, education and health. If the UK is committed to Make Poverty History, it has to return economic sovereignty to developing countries and stop using aid to bully them into unjust, unpopular and unworkable policies. Mike Sansom African Initiatives Like a good liberal, George Monbiot assumes that if something goes one place, it is taken from another (The victims of the tsunami pay the price of war on Iraq, January 4). He assumes that the rest of the world has an automatic claim on the money Americans earn, and that if we just redistribute it, no one will be poor. The world's poor are not poor because of Americans, but because they have corrupt, despotic leaders, who are in large measure supported by the UN and NGOs. One reason the US uses its military assets to deliver aid is to prevent governments and NGO personnel stealing it.
