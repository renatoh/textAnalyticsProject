The Berlaymont building, a hulking star-shaped colossus in the heart of the EU quarter, was abandoned in 1991 when it was found to be riddled with asbestos, and has been under renovation ever since. But its refurbishment, which has been supervised by the Belgian government, has suffered embarrassing delays. It was supposed to be finished by 1998, but will now be at least six years late since the new deadline for partial completion is December 31, 2003. Although the total cost to the Belgian state, which currently owns the building, is estimatted at \u00a3800m, the commission yesterday agreed to buy the building for \u00a3370m. Even that price, however, is far more than it had originally intended to pay. In 1997, the commission said it would pay \u00a3240m. Critics claim that the \"Berlaymonster\" is one of the world's most expensive and ugliest buildings. The headquarters has faced other problems: a fraud investigation into several of the many contractors who crawl over its glass and steel structure every day is still under way; and dozens of the commission officials who first occupied it when it opened in 1967 have since died of cancer. Their relatives and other officials suffering from ill-health blame the asbestos, and many have sued. There have been numerous suggestions that the building should simply have been blown up, but its symbolic value precluded that option. However, it was all smiles yesterday when Neil Kinnock, the commission vice president who negotiated the building's purchase, signed a contract to purchase it from the Belgian government. \"Until the commission had to leave the building, the Berlaymont had long been one of the most important symbols of Europe's presence in the Belgian capital,\" a relaxed Mr Kinnock said. The building - when finally completed - will cover more than 230,000 square metres and house 2,700 officials, including the European commissioners. It will also include a helicopter pad, 14 meeting rooms, 70 interpreters' booths and a self-service restaurant serving 900. Much of the building will be underground, along with a giant car park. Locals who watched with horror as their neighbourhood was bulldozed beyond recognition (a convent was razed to make way for the Berlaymont) see the reoccupation of the building as bringing more free-spending Eurocrats to their doorstep. The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday October 31 2002 The headline on certain editions of this article - EU buys back Berlaymonster headquarters - wrongly gave the impression that the European Commission was buying back its former Brussels headquarters. In fact, the Commission has never owned the Berlaymont building. It rented it. It is now buying it for the first time. In the report it was incorrect to suggest that \"dozens of officials who occupied the building\" from 1967 \"have died of cancer\". In fact, 35 claims relating to asbestos have been made: 18 have been accepted, of which one relates to cancer and 17 to possible symptoms. Of the other 17, 16 have not been accepted on medical grounds and one is still under review. Since 1991, 18 of the 35 people have died but no evidence that asbestos was a contributory cause has been offered and no link has been proven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
