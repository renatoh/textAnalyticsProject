The packed event at Westminster Central Hall, co-organised by the People\u2019s Vote and Best for Britain groups, had a promised lineup featuring a number of remain-minded MPs, as well as an unnamed special guest. This turned out to be Lineker, with the BBC Match of the Day presenter initially appearing in a video message to say that, while he voted remain, he initially believed it was right to accept Brexit should happen. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that back then we didn\u2019t really know what it would entail, the ramifications of leaving the European Union. It\u2019s becoming clear that there are very few positives. It\u2019s almost unanimous that people think it will have some sort of debilitating effect on our economy, at the very least.\u201d A second referendum would be a chance to reassess, he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very rare in life that you get to use the benefit of hindsight.\u201d Lineker then appeared on stage to noisy applause from the crowd, where he was joined by Johnson, who left government on Friday, saying Theresa May was offering the public a false choice of the \u201cvassalage\u201d of her planned agreement or the \u201cchaos\u201d of Brexit. As the pair sat on chairs facing each other, Lineker began: \u201cFirst and foremost, Jo, what did you think of Manchester United\u2019s formation?\u201d, before allowing Johnson to explain that he had also believed it was right to \u201ctry and make a success of Brexit\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cBut it became pretty clear to me over the months, as the Chequers proposals came out in the summer in that white paper, that we weren\u2019t going to get a deal in the national interest. I began to have very serious concerns about whether we were going to be able to make a success of Brexit.\u201d The public was, he said, \u201cnever going to have a Brexit that matches in any way the fantastical promises of the false prospectus that was made\u201d. Johnson said this eventually led to his resignation: \u201cIt was that realisation, really, that the public had been duped, that they were going to get a deal that didn\u2019t reflect at all what they thought they were getting.\u201d Asked if he had discussed the issue with his brother, Boris, the leading Brexiter and former foreign secretary, Johnson said: \u201cWe speak about all issues and we\u2019ve got different views on Brexit. But the funny thing is we\u2019re absolutely united in our analysis that this deal is not in the national interest.\u201d He urged the Conservatives to not take the UK \u201cinto this absurd new relationship with the EU, where vast swaths of our economy will be governed by rules that we\u2019ll have had no hand at all in shaping. It\u2019s completely unsustainable and unacceptable for a proud democracy such as ours\u201d. The rally also heard from MPs including the Tory MP and former education secretary Justine Greening and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who said: \u201cWe will not be bullied into accepting that there is no alternative,\u201d adding there was \u201ca bloody obvious alternative\u201d of a second referendum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
