It must have seemed a vast improvement on last year's winter camp, held in Peterborough, where it rained every day and the squad had to train indoors. The conditions yesterday bore greater resemblance to Cambridgeshire than southern Spain. Not that Arsenal will have minded their fifth-round FA Cup tie against Leeds being postponed. The club-versus- country debate that grips the men's game has taken hold here, too. It is all very well impressing the world with trips to La Manga, but some would say that it might have been more professional for fixtures to have been rescheduled rather than taking players away from their clubs when they should have been preparing for important matches. Vic Akers, the Arsenal manager, is also kit man for the men's team: \"I see the comparisons [with the men's game],\" he said last week. \"And there are no comparisons.\" Certainly not financially. One of the first things Karen Doyle, the FA's head of women's football, did upon taking office in the summer was to throw her arms heavenwards when she caught sight of the paltry rewards for those progressing through the FA Cup: \u00a375,000 for this weekend's male winners, \u00a3250 for the women. That figure might treble next year, but quite what it means for the likes of Langford, who exited after a 7-0 defeat to Charlton , is clear. They recently paid exactly that amount for a single bulb in one of their floodlights (excluding fitting). Doyle, whose grand tour of the UK has already included Birmingham, Leeds, Doncaster and Wales, has also been to Langford, where yesterday the managerial team spent two hours before kick-off scooping 15 gallons of water off the pitch with a dustpan and brush. The village itself might offer little more than a general store and a dog-grooming salon, but this is an ambitious club. Third in the Southern Division (second if you discount the professionals of Fulham), they dominated the back page of the Biggleswade Chronicle when they knocked out Sheffield Wednesday in the previous round and this week start work on a five-year plan. In the only other match of the day, Everton beat Lincoln 7-2 in front of a Sincil Bank crowd of around 1,100."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
