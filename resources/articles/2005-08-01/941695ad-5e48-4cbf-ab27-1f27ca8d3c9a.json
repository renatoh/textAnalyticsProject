Muslim leaders also reacted cautiously to Mr Blair's invocation of the issue of multiculturalism, saying that the language of yesterday morning did not necessarily help. The main themes of condemnation were Mr Blair's refusal to acknowledge a connection between the Iraq war and militancy among British Muslims; and criticism of what groups feared to be the potential illegality of supporting \"oppressed people\" overseas, notably Iraqis and Palestinians. Inayat Bunglawala, a spokesman for the moderate and main umbrella body of British Muslims, the Muslim Council of Britain, called Mr Blair's proposals \"a mixed bag of measures, some of which will cause concern and heighten anxiety across the Muslim community.\" \"We have been looking for statements whereby we can fight this threat in partnership, not from on high. \"There has been no recognition that his own policies have contributed to a radicalisation of the Muslim community; the Iraq war has caused immense damage. And we would reject any measures towards prohibition of movements that support oppressed people elsewhere\". On the banning of Hizb ut-Tahrir, Mr Bunglawala said: \"We hold no brief for them ... but we understand that they are avowedly non-violent, and to ban them is counterproductive. If there are people who don't obey the law, then prosecute them in the courts, don't drive them underground\". On multiculturalism, Mr Bunglawala added: \"Integration is a process of evolution, and this morning's language was deeply unhelpful ... Yes, there may be some who do not speak English, but they are elderly, and the most law-abiding members of our community.\" Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, the leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain forum, said: \"Multiculturalism has not worked. We have created ghettoes rather than integration ... Let us have a debate, a discussion, rather than talk top-down. \"Over the question of extremism, the Muslim community has to stop denying it - we have to admit that we have made mistakes ... [But] the government has to realise that its policies are responsible too\". Arzu Merali, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said: \"The prime minister simply does not want to face up to the fact that what he has done has contributed to these terrible events. \"Instead, he has been inciteful in the language he has used: he has ideologised the whole situation and problematised us beyond redemption ... as both a community and a religion\". Asked about Mr Blair's tributes to Islam as a faith, Ms Merali said: \"In the context of everything else he says, these are dished-out soundbites. I don't see any sign of any respect for the faith.\" Tahir Butt, a spokesman for the Muslim Safety Forum, which liaises with the police on issues of common concern, said: \"This is where the government has been heading all along: al-Qaida claims responsibility for the attacks and Blair targets British Muslims.\" Mr Butt, who works as a forensic-science examiner at New Scotland Yard, added: \"For the last 16 years, I have been fighting against terrorism. How can I be part of the enemy within?\" One of the foremost British Muslim campaigners on civil rights, Bilal Patel, said Mr Blair was \"proposing a whole new raft of measures which can only be interpreted as an attack on Muslims and their right to free speech as British citizens\". One organisation, however, welcomed Mr Blair's announcement. Omar Farooq of the Islamic Society of Britain said measures to deal with the \"menace\" of extremists based in the UK were long overdue. \"We are frustrated to the bone with some of these people in the name of our great religion, in the name of our way of life, going day after day and causing damage to our way of life here,\" he told BBC radio. \"Day after day these lunatics on our behalf go on to the television screens and are really messing up our lives here. We don't want that to happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
