Her daughter Claudia is only seven but her back-to-school list is a lengthy one. She needs at least three new summer school dresses, two new cardigans sewn with the school badge, school shoes (black or blue), a school tie, a new PE kit, a bookbag - the list goes on and on. That is before she gets to the winter shirts, pinafores and coat. Her four-year-old son Rufus is going to nursery and he has a list of requirements of his own. Like many exhausted parents she may be looking forward to a new school term but there is a price to pay and it is higher than ever as the cost of sending children back to school is spiralling. New research shows the average family is having to find more than \u00a3300 to kit out school-age children with clothing, equipment and textbooks. While schools are becoming more concerned with the image of their pupils in a competitive market, creating an expensive trend toward stricter uniform policies, non-uniformed schoolchildren face increasing peer pressure to wear the most expensive designer brands. Pressure can extend down to the smallest children. Claudia was proud of her plastic Thomas the Tank Engine lunch box. 'She was ridiculed by boys in her class for having a baby's or little boy's box so we had to go out and get her a Barbie one,' said her mother. Rachel Lipman, also seven, had the same problem when she took her Action Man rucksack to her non-uniformed school in Stoke Newington, London. 'She doesn't have a uniform and wears jeans and tops to school but she gets a lot of hassle because she doesn't wear pink and Barbie stuff,' said her mother, Amanda. 'She hasn't yet started pressuring me for Nike trainers, although I expect it soon, but my five-year-old Jacob already demands expensive flashing light trainers.' The survey, which questioned a cross-section of 500 parents across Britain, found that 50 per cent of them wanted a ban on wearing certain high-cost clothing brand names at school while 20 per cent said their child's school had already done so. Of those with children aged 12 and over, 78 cent admitted to feeling under pressure to buy trainers seen as 'cool'. Buying fashionable brands adds \u00a350 to the total cost of kitting out a child, which averages \u00a3170 for the first term alone. For parents of younger children especially, rapid growth means they can find themselves having to fork out every few months on shoes, gym plimsolls and kit and school outfits. But the national survey, carried out on behalf of retailer Office World, also revealed that insufficient government funding of the national curriculum was putting extra cost on to parents who, when asked, estimated that buying products linked to curriculum work added \u00a367 to their back-to-school bill for 12 to 18-year-olds. It is the poorer families that are bearing the burden as local authorities are also slashing back on clothing grants which were once available to those on the breadline. Next week the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux will be publishing a separate report which highlights concerns that schools' looking to impress and present a polished image are placing too heavy a burden on parents. The level of financial help available from local authorities has declined dramatically in the past decade with a third offering no help toward uniform costs and a further nine having abolished or cut grants since 2000. A Nacab spokesperson said: 'The results of our survey highlight how the lack of help with school clothing costs is causing serious problems for parents on low incomes. 'School uniforms can reduce the pressure on parents to buy expensive designer gear, but only if school dress codes are applied sensibly and take account of affordability, and only so long as there is financial help available for low income families,' she said. 'Otherwise children can feel excluded or can actually be excluded from school for not having the right uniform.' With costs of uniforms as high as \u00a3300 - one Surrey school was singled out for criticism for having a uniform which included a \u00a345 blazer - CAB staff around the country are reporting more and more approaches by parents whose children are being threatened with explusion over uniform difficulties. Before the summer term ended, the Department for Education and Skills issued new guidelines urging governors, who decide on school uniform or dress code, to give high priority to cost. The Government's own survey showed that while 89 per cent of parents preferred a uniform, a third were worried about cost. Schools Minister Catherine Ashton said: 'It's important that heads and governors make sure their uniforms are affordable. 'Heads and governors should involve parents if uniforms are being brought in to make sure they can afford them. I don't want to see pupils being stigmatised because their families can't afford uniforms.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
