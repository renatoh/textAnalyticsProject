But Harry Redknapp's side will be far from his mind when, an hour after Pompey finish their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley this Saturday, Kennedy's London Irish begin the match that will define their season. Irish meet Perpignan for the third time this season, at the Madejski Stadium in the first of four Heineken Cup quarter-finals at the weekend. And, if the FA Cup has four unlikely semi-finalists, rugby's premier European competition has seen some surprising clubs survive until the arrival of spring. It is also conceivable that unglamorous Irish will be the only English club to make it to the last four. Irish's European run has given the likes of Kennedy a stage on which to impress Brian Ashton. The England coach will not be monitoring only the progress of Shane Geraghty, the prodigy who this winter has been overtaken by Danny Cipriani. The 25-year-old lock Kennedy will be making a case for a place in the England squad for this June's Tests in New Zealand. If it is possible for someone 6ft 7in tall to have a low profile it is Kennedy. Week after week he slogs away in the Premiership in a second-row partnership with his captain, Bob Casey, and lords it in the lineout against better-known opponents. He is a regular snaffler of opponents' ball. He is quick and athletic and London Irish's forwards coach, Toby Booth, is not alone in thinking he can be a long-term replacement in the England side for the ageing Simon Shaw or Ben Kay. Booth is now also helping coach England Saxons, the second-string side for whom Kennedy has appeared. \"It depends what England want. If it is a more expansive approach with athletic forwards providing more quick, first-phase ball, then Nick could be the answer. He's seen as a lineout player but he's much more than that,\" says Booth. Kennedy says: \"Of course I'd love to go to New Zealand. I think I've played well for the Saxons when the opportunities arose but sometimes you have to bide your time. Fingers crossed, I'll get a chance to step up soon but there are a lot of good second-rows in England and I'm not going to rubbish any of them.\" In the meantime Irish are concentrating on beating the French side who Mike Catt says are the biggest he's faced, and the memory of their last meeting lingers. In December Irish were beaten 23-6 at Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral; Perpignan were nursing a grievance from a week earlier, when Irish won 24-16. The game in France will be remembered for the shocking photographs of Kennedy's fellow forward Kieron Roche, whose cheekbone and eye socket were fractured by a stray elbow from Perpignan's England prop Perry Freshwater. Irish are not short of hard-nut forwards themselves, including Casey and the All Black Clarke Dermody, who has helped shore up their front row this season, but the Exiles are preparing for another physical confrontation on Saturday. \"Yes, they are a physical side but they don't just play 10-man rugby,\" Kennedy says. \"They have big forwards but, like all French teams, backs who can play with flair. It was a hard game down there. Everyone remembers what happened to Kieron but it wasn't littered with incidents. What I remembered about it was the weather. It was horrible. It was raining and snowing and we got four seasons in 80 minutes and it was a game played in the forwards. It could be a contrast of styles at the weekend. We like to play with ball from the top of the lineout and counterattack. The Madejski pitch usually lends itself to attacking rugby and we won't be changing the way we play. \"The lineout is important to us. There are still double the amount of lineouts than scrums in the average game. You only have to look at the World Cup final to realise that is where a game can be won and lost. I'm lucky because I've been playing a long time with Bob Casey and Kieron Roche and we know how each of us plays in the lineout and we always work on the lineout during pre-season. Danie Coetzee and David Paice, our hookers, also deserve credit for putting the ball in the right places for us.\" The limelight may have eluded Kennedy until now, despite a celebrity partner in the actor Ali Bastian, once of Hollyoaks and now of The Bill, who has moved into his home near Twickenham. It is not all glamour, though. Yesterday Kennedy went home to clear up the mess after putting his foot through a staircase infested with dry rot. Probably not something Posh and Becks often have to deal with."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
