In the last three months the 'no-frills' players have cleaned up in Europe. While transatlantic traffic on the likes of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Virgin Atlantic fell by a third or more, passenger traffic in Europe for easyJet, Ryanair and Go rose by as much as 30 per cent. Special offers of flights for a penny, or even free tickets, brought people wavering about flying back into the airports in their flocks, lured by stunning fares and the idea that terrorists were more likely to attack BA than Buzz - having picked off the world's two largest airlines with American and United on 11 September. Just last week The Observer revealed that BA intends pulling off dozens of European routes where its market is being usurped by Ryanair, easyJet, Go, Buzz and Virgin Express - for business and not just leisure traffic. A senior source said: 'The low-cost airlines are not going away and it comes to the point where we have to juggle the concepts of flying short-haul and returning the BA business to profitability.' BA is likely to carry on flying to all the major European capitals because they are profitable, or at least prestigious and valuable in terms of feeding passengers into the Heathrow long-haul network. But on many of the regional European and domestic routes, it is seriously asking itself if if should simply surrender. When BA was cross-subsidising its loss-making domestic and Continental routes from fat transatlantic profits every year, the impact of the low-cost airlines was less noticeable on the surface. But it was genuine and now, with American profits wiped out, it is glaringly obvious. American profits will come back in time, but the effect of the low-cost airlines on the monoliths' European market is likely to be permanent. The current players may not all survive and there may be new entrants or mergers between some of the existing airlines, but the low-cost phenomenon has truly crossed the Atlantic. Dublin-based Ryanair and easyJet, based in Luton and created by entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannaou, dominate two-thirds of the European low-cost airline market, according to a recent report from stockbroker West LB Panmure. It predicted that the market for low-cost airlines inside the EU will grow from the current 20 million passengers a year to 125m by 2015. This breed of airline has already snapped up 14 per cent of the UK and Republic of Ireland air travel market in the last five years, but only 2 per cent in continental Europe - and the scope for growth is huge. Ryanair, easyJet and Go are all profitable. Although Go last week acknowledged Ryanair's dominance between Scotland and Dublin, abandoning the route, it simultaneously announced it was establishing a third UK base at East Midlands Airport. Airlines such as BA have known for some time that they would have to deal with the problem of low-cost carriers invading their network. At the start of the Nineties, leading airline chiefs, City analysts and to an extent the media in Europe did not believe the low-cost airline business could take off over here. Airport and air traffic control costs in Europe were too expensive for airlines to drop their fares low enough and places like Luton (and even Stansted at that time) were a bit of a national joke. They were wrong. Ryanair and easyJet boomed. When BA announced it was starting its own offshoot low-cost carrier, Go, to compete with them, it was clear the low-cost phenomenon was being taken seriously. One of its most sparky and promising senior executives Barbara Cassani, was appointed to run Go. This summer Cassani sought backing from venture capital group 3i and bought Go from BA for \u00a3100 million. Ryanair and easyJet have floated and Go wants to go the same way by summer 2004. And easyJet and Go, in particular, enjoy a growing chunk of the business travel market. Business travel has grown from a negligible part to around 40 per cent of the market for Go, as travel managers and the self-employed keep an eye on their expenses. To this end, before 11 September when the airline industry only had an economic downturn to worry about, airlines such as Ryanair were welcoming the prospect of a recession because chief executive Michael O'Leary knew it would bring hard-pressed business travellers on a pilgrimage from Heathrow to Stansted and bargain fares. In general terms, low-cost airlines save themselves money by cherry-picking routes, paying their staff less than the national carriers and making passengers pay for everything from wheelchairs to coffee. They outsource all their maintenance and other non-core needs, sell most of their tickets online, fly only one type of aircraft and often use smaller airports that are further away from the destination city, which do not have shopping malls but do have cheap or sometimes even no landing fees. Cassani said: 'The growth of the low-cost airlines shows that people are fed up with paying ridiculously high fares for a short European flight.' It's as simple as that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
