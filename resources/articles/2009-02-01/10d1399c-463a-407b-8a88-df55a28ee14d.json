The announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange did not indicate the size of any deal with Chinalco but it is thought that it could be for at least \u00a36bn. The talks with the aluminium company are part of an urgent refinancing promised by Rio's chief executive, Tom Albanese. The mining company has been saddled with debt since taking over Alcan as the credit crunch began in mid-2007. Albanese has turned to the Chinese producer, which owns 9% of Rio after an audacious dawn raid a year ago, with a view to selling it some bonds and possibly stakes in mines to try to cut debt by $10bn (\u00a37bn) by the end of this year. If a deal can be agreed, it would represent a substantial investment by the Chinese government and further reflect the shift in power between recession-struck developed countries and faster-growing Asian economies. Beijing has been aggressively building stakes in energy and natural resources companies to feed its rapidly growing economy. Rio, with a listing in London and Sydney, stressed that no agreement had been reached and that there was \"no certainty a transaction will ultimately take place\". The announcement referred to \"acquiring minority interests\" in a number of Rio businesses and possibly the issue of convertible bonds. It did not mention a share sale to Chinalco, a possibility that would require Rio to tread carefully to ensure shareholders do not feel their stock is being unfairly diluted if it issues more shares to Chinalco. Pre-emption rights have been a point of issue in recent weeks. Barclays was punished by investors for inviting Middle Eastern governments to buy new shares and Rio's rival Xstrata is embroiled in a row over its fundraising deal with its largest investor, Glencore. Chinalco's stake in Rio would rise from 9% to at least 15% if new shares were issued. Rio stressed tonight that shareholders would have to approve any deal, as would regulators. The talks are part of a contingency plan being drawn up by Rio and advisers at JP Morgan Cazenove. It is thought that if the talks break down, Rio will be left with little option but to launch a rights issue - an eventuality it is refusing to rule out. Though its next scheduled announcement to the London Stock Exchange is on February 12, when its results are due, it was forced to issue an update to investors in Australia when the stockmarket opened in Sydney tonight. It is likely to issue the same announcement in London when the market opens. Rio's shares have collapsed from the \u00a360 at which Chinalco stormed into the market a year ago to a little over \u00a315. BHP Billiton's decision in November to walk away from the takeover of Rio knocked its share price and forced Albanese to commit to the debt reduction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
