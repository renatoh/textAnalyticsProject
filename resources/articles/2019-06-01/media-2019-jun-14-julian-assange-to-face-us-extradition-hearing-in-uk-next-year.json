The WikiLeaks founder faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. At Westminster magistrates court on Friday, the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, ordered that a full extradition hearing should begin on 25 February. Ben Brandon, representing the US, formally opened the case, a day after an extradition request was signed off by the home secretary, Sajid Javid. \u201cThis is related to one of the largest compromises of confidential information in the history of the United States,\u201d Brandon told the court. As Brandon ran through a summary of the accusations against Assange, including that he had cracked a US defence network password, Assange, appearing by video link, protested: \u201cI didn\u2019t break any password whatsoever.\u201d Assange, 47, who was dressed in a grey T-shirt, had a white beard and was wearing black-framed glasses, said 175 years of his life was at stake and defended his website against hacking claims, saying: \u201cWikiLeaks is nothing but a publisher.\u201d His lawyer, Mark Summers QC, described the case as \u201can outrageous and full-frontal assault on journalistic rights\u201d. His legal team also said he was challenging the 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail he is serving after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden. Assange is accused in the US of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer. Outside the court, his supporters protested against the UK\u2019s treatment of him. A crowd of around a dozen people held banners, with some chanting \u201cJustice for Julian Assange\u201d and \u201cDefend freedom and democracy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
