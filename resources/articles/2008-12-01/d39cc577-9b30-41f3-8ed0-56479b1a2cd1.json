Sorry if you've been directed here in search of the weather forecast from Hull. Thanks to a \"tagging problem\" this is precisely the place you would have found such information earlier, but you missed it. Instead, there's some clocks. Watch them. Movie reviews of the future: I read today, over lentil and mushroom cottage pie in the Guardian canteen, that Buz Luhrmann has bought the rights to The Great Gatsby and wants to ruin one of the greatest American novels by adapting it as a credit crunch social commentary. This must not be allowed to happen. Get your oily, sunscreen-moistened fingers off, Luhrmann. You might as well get Pete \"Vantage Point\" Travers to direct The Catcher in the Rye. Or Anthony Tierman adapting the Sound and the Fury. And while this may or may not be the best platform for this ranting, it's the only platform I have. In the world of football, this is a largely drab day of Premier League action, with Aston Villa's visit to West Ham being the pick of only five games, and that not kicking off until 5.30pm. At least that allows Tom Lutz to minute-by-minute it, but in the meantime, I'm going to be struggling to keep my eyes open over Blackburn v Stoke, Bolton v Portsmouth, Fulham v Middlesbrough and Hull v Sunderland. And I'm not even watching them. I'm watching Matthew Le Tissier, Phil Thompson, Tony Cottee, that fool Kamara and others watch them, in between exchanging light-hearted mockery with Countdown's Jeff Stelling. 2.10pm: Of course, there's a top of the table cracker going on in the Championship at the moment, and Birmingham have just equalised against Reading with a pearler from Kevin Phillips, 63. Reading are just about close enough to London to allow me to cover it, being a London-centric, Premier League-obessed media representative, of course. 2.15pm: And Reading take the lead again, Kevin Doyle flicking Stephen Hunt's free kick past Maik Taylor. \"He's completely alone,\" observes Birmingham's Tom Lutz, not unreasonably. This following his initial reaction to the goal, which began with the letter eff. 2.20pm: What else have we got today? Well, there's one for the old, with history's Southampton hosting ancient history's Nottingham Forest in a relegation six-pointer at St Mary's. There's bottom versus top as Doncaster entertain Wolves. And squandered wealth's QPR can get within a point of Preston if the Hoops can take three points in West London today. In Scotland, Rangers host Hibs, while a plastered Davy Allan, who you might remember from such previous minute-by-minute coverages as this morning's cricket OBO, will be cheering on his beloved Hearts through a champagne fug after relentlessly downing expensive booze on his trip up to Edinburgh from London. They're up against Dundee United. 2.25pm: Some team news: Bolton v Portsmouth Bolton: Jaaskelainen, Steinsson, Cahill, Andrew O'Brien, Samuel, Davies, Nolan, McCann, Taylor, Gardner, Elmander. Subs: Al Habsi, Muamba, Smolarek, Riga, Shittu, Basham, Obadeyi. Portsmouth: James, Pamarot, Campbell, Distin, Hreidarsson, Diop, Davis, Hughes, Kranjcar, Defoe, Crouch. Subs: Ashdown, Diarra, Nugent, Little, Kanu, Armand Traore, Wilson. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) 2.26pm: Some more team news: Blackburn v Stoke Blackburn: Robinson, Ooijer, Samba, Nelsen, Warnock, Emerton, Dunn, Andrews, Pedersen, McCarthy, Roberts. Subs: Brown, Kerimoglu, Khizanishvili, Mokoena, Simpson, Judge, Derbyshire. Stoke: Sorensen, Shawcross, Sonko, Abdoulaye Faye, Higginbotham, Delap, Whelan, Amdy Faye, Cresswell, Pericard, Fuller. Subs: Simonsen, Olofinjana, Soares, Pugh, Davies, Tonge, Wilkinson.

Subs: Colgan, Whitehead, Edwards, Murphy, Leadbitter, Yorke, Healy. Referee: Mike Riley (Yorkshire) 2.30pm: Reading are heading to second place in the Championship Kalifa Cisse applies the finishing touch to a wonderful, raking cross from Kevin Doyle. It's a splendid ball from the right, bang onto the forward's noddle, and he beats Taylor. Lutz swears, and there are eight minutes left for his beloved Blues to rescue something at St Andrews. Reading lead 3-1. 2.35pm: The most exciting nugget of team news today is that Lassana Diarra is on the Portsmouth bench. His transfer to Real Madrid has reportedly hit a snag this morning, but Tony Adams seems resigned to losing him and is wrapping him up in cotton wool, and a thick training tracksuit, for the trip to Bolton. He might not have even got that close to first team action in truth, but in effect there's now a \u00a320m bag of cash sitting on the Reebok Stadium bench. 2.45pm: Birmingham 1-3 Reading The Royals do enough to overhaul Blues. A first-half strike from Hunt was cancelled out by Phillips in the second half. But then Kevin Doyle's 16th of the season and Kalifa Cisse's third wrapped up the win. Reading go second, four points behind Wolves; Blues are third, still comfortably ahead of Burnley. 2.50pm: Did you ever think there'd be an area of light entertainment that you'd watch and think: \"What are you doing Jason Donovan? You're better than that.\" I've just seen the Iceland Christmas ad. It's beneath you Jason, it really is. 2.51pm: I could not possibly be more sure that there is no one reading this. 2.55pm: Self-indulgence abounds at Sky Sports News as the \"posse\" show a trailer for the Super Saturday Special, featuring Jeff Stelling hosting a game of charades with Charlie Nicholas, Paul Merson, et al. All very cosy wrapped in neat sweaters. Please, please, please can someone kick a football. Or send an email. Or wheel this chair off the balcony, with me still sitting in it. 3pm: Kick off Bolton 1-0 Portsmouth: Very, very early goal as Matt Taylor scored against his former club. The former left-back takes control of the ball on the edge of the box, flicks it over the defender's head, and strikes one under David James in the Pompey goal. Johan Elmander goes close soon after. 3.03pm: Bolton 2-0 Portsmouth Two-nil in three minutes, and it's shocking defending from Portsmouth. A long ball into the box is nodded down by Kevin Davies and the ball bounces around in acres of space before Ricardo Gardner strolls forward to hammer it past James. Coventry go 1-0 up over Ipswich. 3.07pm: Goals so far for Leicester against Peterborough (Craig Morgan own goal); Rotherham against Accrington (Mark Burchill penalty) and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge against Macclesfield (Paul Benson) 3.10pm: Penalty for Blackburn! The Sam Allardyce era begins with Pedersen streaking into the box down the left and Sonko launching a hacking hack at him. Benni McCarthy, in for the injured Roque Santa Cruz, rolls the penalty in. 1-0 to Allardyce. 3.13pm: Bad news, throw-in fans. Rory Delap is wincing as he grips his side and he passes on the chance to launch his first sling-shot into the box. \"Oh! What a goal!\" interrupts a screaming Matt Le Tissier and describes a 25-yard screamer from Steed Malbranque. Hull 0-1 Sunderland. 3.15pm: Stoke's Ricardo Fuller gets blocked in the box by Blackburn's Samba. Might have been a penalty, nothing doing. Ipswich equalise against Coventry in the Championship; Kevin Lisbie with it. 3.16pm: MK Dons take the lead against Leeds United. 3.17pm: QPR lead 1-0 at home, Heidar Helguson with a header that goes \"Bam,\" according to Chris Kamara. 3.20pm: Blackburn 2-0 Stoke Totally against the run of play, Sam Allardyce is now 2-0 up against Stoke. Ooijer puts the cross in from the right, it bounces off Danny Higginbotham's foot and straight into the patch of Jason Roberts, who can't miss from three yards. Aberdeen lead against Inverness. 3.21pm: Nick Barmby equalises for Hull. Oh, and Peter Crouch gets one back for Portsmouth. Krankjaer crosses to the far post for Crouch to nod in. Barmby's was a goalmouth scramble. Plenty of goals here. Hull 1-1 Sunderland Fulham 0-0 Middlesbrough Blackburn 2-0 Stoke Bolton 2-1 Portsmouth 3.25pm: I've got emails! \"I'm stuck in work too, and the promised \"retail rush\" that is supposedly heading my way today, has singularly failed to materialise,\" says Chris Doyle, alleviating none of our credit crunch concerns. \"I'm trying to get excited about today's games, but it's really very difficult. I've just tried to visualise what it would be like if Fulham managed to start scoring, Hangeland went off injured after about 5 minutes (it's the only way Boro will get more than one, let's be honest), and a 3-3 thriller ensued. The effort nearly burst a blood vessel just behind my eye though, so I stopped and returned to the image of a drab 1-0 with Hangeland scoring a header from a corner *sigh* I think the rest of the games will be similar. I wouldn't be surprised if we see less than 4 goals in total in the 3pm matches today.\" Happy to say that this prediction is already out of date. 3.26pm: Alan Parkinson: \"1) I'm at work 2)I'm bored 3)My friend thinks Tony Adams looks like Beetlejuice. 4)I think he's right.\" Thanks for this deluge of emails. I didn't get a chance to print them all as those goals started flying in. 3.28pm: Sam Allardyce 3-0 Rory Delap FC Three attacks, three goals for Blackburn according to Paul Merson. Benni McCarthy gets his second, off the shins of Higginbotham apparently. 3.30pm: Tony Paley, horse racing tipster extraordinaire, suddenly lets out a whoop of celebration on the other side of the office. This either means that a huge bet of his has just come in, or he's a Preston fan. Because they've just equalised against QPR. 3.35pm: Fulham and Boro are playing out the only goalless game in the Premier League at the moment. Lincoln lead Notts County 1-0 (Patulea). Lee James on the Baz Luhrmann/F Scott Fitzgerald atrocity: \"'Allow me to share with you my current mental image of two rival, mincing gangs called east egg and west egg- with Nicole Kidman as Daisy. You can see it can't you?\" I don't want to think about it. I bet Ryan Reynolds will play Jay. It's wrong, all wrong. 3.37pm: Brilliant double save at the Reebok Stadium from David James. Gardner's effort is saved by the Guardian man's feet, then Matt Taylor fires the follow up right at him again. QPR go back into the lead, Helguson getting his second. 3.38pm: Andy Johnson has just been involved in a horror-injury moment with Middlesbrough's Julio Arca. Apparently Arca should have seen red for a shocker against the Fulham striker, and even mild-mannered Roy Hodgson is brandishing imaginary red cards in the direction of Gareth Southgate. Johnson may well have broken his leg. \"Could you please stop calling Stoke City FC, Rory Delap FC,\" says Steve Clowes. It's just our little joke Steve. Sometimes they work. \"Rory won't be able to take throw ins for quite a while. Since Sonko is taking the long throw ins and he's determined to give Blackburn lots of early Christmas presents, perhaps we could be called Santa Sonko FC for the rest of the game.\" Done.* *Probably not done. 3.42pm: Panic over, Fulham fans: Andrew Johnson is fine and is involved as Jimmy Bullard opens the scoring for Fulham against Middlesbrough. Goals now in all the Premiership games. 3.45pm: Nottingham Forest take the lead against Southampton. Wes Morgan, if I heard Paul Walsh right. We're approaching half time and I'm getting out of here. Tom Lutz will be your guide through the second half. Keep him company with your mails through the second half. His address is up there. Bye. Afternoon and a big thank you to Howard Swains who stayed on for 16 minutes longer than he had to so I could almost finish the quick crossword (Medieval official - pass rope through an eye R_E_E). Will keep you up to date with the scores once goals start being scored again in a little thing I like to call the second half. 4.06pm: We have a winner for the crossword competiton. \"Reeve,\" says Joe Pearson. \"Not that I'm a Dark Ages nerd or anything.\" You're not a geek, Joe, you're a [Spod (4) GE_K]. Arca of leg-breaking fame is off for [Rotund, ineffective striker M_D_ (4)] at Fulham v Boro. 4.08pm: Dagenham and Redbridge who are the most unpredicatable side in the League - they'll win 18-0 one week and lose 5-0 the next - are 4-0 up at Macclesfield. 4.12pm: Murphy scores and it's Fulham 2-0 Boro. 4.13pm: Doncaster don't really concede goals or score them, for that matter - check out this run of binarytastic results - and are holding Wolves at home, while League Two super predators, Wycombe are 1-0 up. 4.16pm: A howler from [Observer columnist - mistake magnet goalkeeper (5,5) D_V_D/J_M_S] nearly lets Bolton go 3-1 up. 4.19pm: Dempsey makes it 3-0 for Fulham, his first ggoal at home for over a year. 4.21pm: Norwich seem to be adapting to life without Lee Clark just fine as one of their 634 loan signings, Leroy Lita, makes it 1-0 against Charlton. 4.23pm: You get the feeling Portsmouth will get something against Bolton. Gary Megson's free-scoring bucaneers have had a chance cleared off the line and should be three of four up. 4.24pm: Up in Scotland it's Rangers 1-0 Hibs. 4.26pm: Kevin Davies gets another chance for Bolton, he flies in to connect with a cross that flies acorss the box, but his shot dribbles off his thigh and David James just about collects. 4.28pm: Swansea who are in the middle of a semi-slump have edged ahead of Blackpool after a Jason Scotland goal. Blackpool 0-1 Swansea. 4.31pm: At the top of League One, Leicester and the magnificent Matty Fryatt are 3-0 up against Peterbrough and MK Dons are beating plucky mid-table Leeds 3-1. 4.33pm: At the bottom of the Championship, Forest are 1-0 up against the sometimes-brilliant-mostly-self-destructive Southampton. 4.35pm: \"So who is more loathsome in the eyes of English football fans, Leeds United or MK Dons?\" asks George Templeton. It's a zinger of the question. English fans are a fair bunch and probably dislike them equally. 4.38pm :Speaking of popular football figures, Kieran Richardson is involves as a Zayatte own goal makes it Hull 1-2 Sunderland. 4.40pm: Saints do their crumbly thing as they go 2-0 down to Forest, no thanks to Joe Garner. It's a terrible shame if they do go down because they have some wonderfully talented players. 4.41pm: It wouldn't be Doncaster if it wasn't a 1-0 final score. They've just gone a goal down against Wolves. And Hull have just had Sam Ricketts sent off. 4.43pm: That'll be Hull 1-3 Sunderland. Kenwyne Jones gets it and he's in wonderful form at the moment. 4.47pm: Obligatory Santa dancing the conga scenes as Wolves cruise towards victory at Doncaster. 4.49pm: Elmander balloons a shot over the bar against Pompey, on reflection there's no way Bolton are going to lose that one. 4.50pm: Cisse seals Sunderland's victory: they're 4-1 up now. 4.51pm: Leicester will stay top of League One, they've just gone 4-0 up. 4.53pm: Bolton nearly pay for their waateful position as Defoe flashes a shot over. But that's the last significant moment and it ends Bolton 2-1 Portsmouth. It's over a Craven Cottage too and Fulham beat Boro 3-0. 4.55pm: Ricky Sbragia's Sunderland beat Hull 4-1 and it's over at Ewood Park where it ended Blackburn 3-0 Stoke. See? Just lose your manager and all will be well. Unless you appoint Tony Adams. Wolves go seven points clear at the top of the Championship as they beat Doncaster 1-0. For all today's results click here. And I'll be back here in 20 minutes or so to see Villa take on West Ham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
