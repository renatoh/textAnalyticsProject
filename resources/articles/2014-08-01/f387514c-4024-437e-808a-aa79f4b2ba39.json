The truth, say film-makers Tony Gerber and Maxim Pozdorovkin, is murkier but far more entertaining. They see Bout, a Russian \"entrepreneur\" who shipped everything from cola to zoo animals alongside guns, as more chancer than villain. Using home videos (Bout was a camcorder nut) and extensive interviews with his wife, former business partners and the DEA agents who caught him, Gerber and Pozdorovkin introduce a garrulous, intelligent man who had transported arms for years and was eventually undone by a post-9/11 crackdown. Bout, who was Hollywoodised by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film Lord of War, is painted as a victim of his own success, a weapons dealer who started earning too much buck for his bang. The arms trade has always been shady. Governments want it that way. Bout worked in the grey areas, crossing the line morally, if not legally, many times over. \"He's not the Merchant of Death, he's a merchant of some death,\" says an old acquaintance. But then, when weapons are for sale, isn't everyone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
