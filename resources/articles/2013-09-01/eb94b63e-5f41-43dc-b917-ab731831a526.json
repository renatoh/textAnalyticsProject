It includes 61 civilians whose bodies have been recovered, six members of the Kenyan security forces and at least six terrorist suspects. That's according to Kenya's President, Uhuru Kenyatta, who proclaimed victory earlier today over those who stormed a Nairobi mall. We're going to wrap the blog up now. You can read a full report here from Nairobi by Afua Hirsch, the Guardian's west Africa correspondent, on Kenyatta's comments and other developments today. Lindsey Hilsum, International Editor at Channel 4 News, has been blogging about a remarkable story involving a woman who rushed to Westgate after hearing that a friend had been shot. She kept calling his mobile number from outside the building. Eventually someone answered, but to her horror it was not her friend - it was his killer. You can read the blog here. Amid continued speculation about the involvement not just of Somalis or Kenyans in the attack, but of foreigners such as the UK terrorism suspect, Samantha Lewthwaite, here's a tweet from the Guardian's West Africa Correspondent, Afua Hirsch: The father of a four-year-old British boy who was reportedly spared by a terrorist gunman at the Westgate centre after telling him \"You're a very bad man\" has released a statement through the British Foreign Office. Dan Prior said: I am very relieved that my family have survived and my thoughts go out to those families that are not as fortunate as my own. My children are traumatised and my wife is very unwell as a result of this senseless atrocity. As a family we now need time and privacy to heal. We would strongly urge anyone interested in helping out the victims of this attack to make donations to the Kenya Red Cross. The reaction of Prior's son during the attack reportedly prompted the gunman to spare him and his six-year-old sister, along with their mother, asking them for forgiveness and giving the children chocolate bars. The boy was in a supermarket with mother and sister when terrorists stormed the Westgate shopping centre on Saturday, The Sun reported. He is believed to have been trying to protect his mother, who had been shot in the leg. His uncle, Alex Coutts, told The Sun that when terrorists asked if any children were alive in the supermarket, the boy, his sister and mother stood up and said yes. The boy is said to have shouted at one man: \"You're a bad man, let us leave.\" Coutts told the newspaper: \"He was very brave. The terrorists even gave the kids Mars bars.\" A major push is underway now by the Kenyan authorities to try to contain the damage to its tourism industry from the Westgate attack and siege. As it happens, the assault took place days before Nairobi was set to host hundreds of international investors. Here's how the Kenyan television channel, NTV, has been reporting on the fall-out: The channel also has a report on Kenyan members of parliament who have been calling for the country's intelligence service to be overhauled, and for its head to be sacked. In a city that's home to hundreds of regional corporate offices, as well as large numbers of foreign students and NGOs, the Nairobi attack amounts to a \"brutal wake-up call\" for many ex-pats, according to this interesting piece about them in the Christian Science Monitor. Its correspondent, Mike Pflanz, has been speaking to some of those ex-pats, including one British woman who has lived in Nairobi for close to a decade and who told him: How can any of us sit in any of these shopping centers any more and not think that it can happen again? Still, Pflanz also reports that some experienced international business and corporate types are saying they will take the mall assault in their stride. Jules Lambert, a British petrochemicals entrepreneur who has lived in Nigeria and South Africa and is planning to move to Kenya soon, said: I am about to invest a lot of money in an oil and gas project in Kenya, and this attack, while horrific, does not put me off or make me worry excessively about security. Read the piece in full here. The Somalia-based Islamist group known as al-Shabaab will emerge stronger and more unified after its terrorist attack in Nairobi, and could provide other extreme groups with an example to follow, counter-insurgency analysts have warned. A piece by the Guardian's Richard Norton-Taylor (which can now be read in full here) has some interesting quotes from David Kilcullen, a former adviser to David Petraeus, then US commander in Iraq, and of Nato forces in Afghanistan. Kilcullen suggested that al-Shabaab wanted to provoke over-reaction by the Kenyan security forces and thereby gain more support, especially in Eastleigh, the eastern district of Nairobi where most of the 250,000 Somalis in the Kenyan capital live. With other analysts, Kilcullen predicted that there would be further attacks in east African countries, including Uganda, which had sent troops to fight al-Shabaab in Somalia as part of an African Union force, and Ethiopia, which had deployed troops across the border in Somalia. Kenyan government sources have been telling journalists that the attackers rented shop property at the mall ahead of their assault, smuggling in weapons and ammunition (tweets Sky's Alex Crawford). The Financial Times also has more on this (paywall), quoting a senior government adviser who said that the authorities believe the assault was \"meticulously planned\". He is quoted as saying: They rented a shop and have slowly been smuggling in equipment; how do you explain them being able to hold fire from Saturday, Sunday, Monday \u2013 to sustain for all those hours. There was a timetable to be smuggling those things in there. What do events of the last few days in Nairobi mean for the wider threat to other countries from jihadist attacks? In the case of the US at least, one leading security expert has written a piece for the Guardian suggesting that it would be wise to ignore those who warn that attack will lead to more incidents there. Karen Greenberg, director of the centre on national security at Fordham University law school, writes that the relationship between al-Shabaab and the Somali-American community has been at the centre of the concerns of figures like the Republican Congressman Peter King. She accuses King of fear-mongering despite evidence to the contrary: After all, the Somali diaspora in the United States has demonstrated \u2013 for example, in Minneapolis and St Paul, where many of the foreign fighters come from \u2013 a strong determination towards integration into the American way of life via educational institutions, business and civic organizations. And do we really want to assume the worst as a means of prevention? Have we become a society too scared to think that our law enforcement officials can weed out those who pose a danger to the United States from those who break the law in a misguided effort to support local causes abroad? You can read her piece in full here. Afua Hirsch, the Guardian's west Africa correspondent, has filed a piece on \"the surreal atmosphere of solidarity\" among patients and visitors at the MP Shah hospital in Nairobi. One young man attracted a small crowd. With a nervous gesture he pulled up the olive green sleeve of his standard-issue hospital clothing to reveal an almost perfectly round shrapnel wound in his arm, a gash of shocking pink and white in his brown skin. His arm was badly bruised and he had similar wounds on both legs. Francis, 23, worked in the Nakumatt supermarket, a popular shop on the second floor of the Westgate mall. He was helping shoppers in the electronics section on Saturday when he heard a loud bang. \"At first I thought it was just a tyre bursting, the sound was coming from near the entrance,\" said Francis, who did not want to reveal his last name. \" But then we heard people running and screaming, and we realised something was wrong.\" You can read more here. A total of 61 civilians and six members of the security forces were killed in the fighting, Kenya's President, Uhuru Kenyatta, said in that address a little earlier. A further 62 people are injured in hospital, he said, adding: As I had promised earlier, we have ashamed and defeated our attackers. That part of our task has been completed by our multi-agency security team. I promise that we shall have full accountability for the mindless destruction, deaths, pain, loss and suffering we have all undergone as a national family. These cowards will meet justice, as will their accomplices, wherever they are. While he said \"the worst\" of the crisis was now over, it was unclear whether Kenyan security forces had finally accounted for all the militants. Journalists are pointing out that Kenyatta's speech still leaves some important unanswered questions, namely: Goran Tomasevic, a veteran war photographer and the chief Reuters photographer for East Africa, has filed his account of the siege, accompanied by some of the extraordinary photographs he has taken in recent days (Warning: graphic content). He went to the mall from a friend's home and realised that something was very seriously wrong when he found bodies lying in the car park. Some of Tomasevic's pictures from recent days are below. writes: I entered the mall and followed the police searching room by room until we ended up on the ground floor where the supermarket is located. A policeman got shot in the stomach. He asked me to take a picture of him screaming and asked me for help. I tried to help him but I guess he was in shock or something because when I helped him up he started firing his rifle into the floor. He almost shot me accidentally. Then he dropped the weapon. He adds: There was one moment when the police and I were hiding behind a column in the mall, sort of a stand holding something up. It wasn\u2019t part of the building. I knocked on it and it was made out of thin material. I said \u201cHey guys knock on this!\u201d Everyone started to knock. They said \u201cSo, what?\u201d I said \u201cIt\u2019s not going to protect us.\u201d So, I dived down and everyone followed. Tomasevic was also responsible for that photograph (below) of a little girl running through the mall with a terrified look on her face as a man reaches out to apparently usher her to safety This is Ben Quinn taking over the blog now. The four-day siege is now over Kenyatta says. \u201cFellow Kenyans, we have been badly hurt and feel great pain and loss, but we have been brave, united and strong. Kenya has stared down great evil and triumphed.\" He made clear that three floors of the shopping centre had collapsed towards the \"tail end\" of the operation. Video we published earlier has captured the aftermath of this. Three bodies were still buried in the rubble. \u201cIntelligence reports had suggested that a British woman and two or three American citizens may have been involved in the attack.\" \"We can not confirm the details at present but forensic experts are working to ascertain the nationalities of the terrorists.\u201d \"We have shamed and defeated our attackers. That part of our task was completed,\" he added. The country's leader Uhuru Kenyatta has announced three days of mourning. He says that five terrorists have been killed by gunfire along with six security officers. 11 suspects are in custody. He says he can not confirm nationalities of terrorists who he brands as \"cowards\". Another dramatic report from a witness who has spoken to the BBC: A British woman caught up in the Nairobi terror attack has described how she fled with her young son and her husband as bullets flew around them. Lynsey Khatau, 23, who divides her time between Pontllanfraith in South Wales and the Kenyan city, was shopping with husband Max and Caiz, four. She said she began to think something was wrong when the lights went off but did not come back on as they usually do during regular power cuts. \"The first thing that happened was that a grenade went off under a car or something outside - that was the first thing that we heard,\" she told BBC Wales. \"Then there was shooting, maybe 20 rounds, in less than a minute. We came out - I just ran, we just ran out. \"When we came out of the supermarket they were already inside the mall and we just ran. They were already shooting inside. \"It was really horrific. My son is really traumatised. \"We were going to die - that was the only thing I was thinking, we're going to die. There were people just falling everywhere.\" The Guardian's Richard Norton-Taylor writes: The Somalia-based Islamist group, al-Shabaab, will emerge stronger and more unified after its terrorist attack in Nairobi, and has provided other extremist groups with an example to follow, leading counter-insurgency analysts warned on Tuesday. Al-Shabaab\u2019s message is that it is \u201cdown but not out\u201d, it is \u201closing territory but not people\u201d, David Kilcullen, a former adviser to General David Petraeus, then US commander in Iraq and to Nato forces in Afghanistan, said. His full report should be up shortly. Getting reports that President Kenyatta's address to the nation, which is already an hour late, may now not take place. This from Daniel Howden of the Independent in the UK: Our own Vikram Dodd tweets: Some very frank interviews conducted with people on the street of Mogadishu, Somalia, by a journalist for the Guardian: Abdiwali Mohamed, a member of a Somali youth organization I have a great empathy with the innocent civilians who were trapped in between Al-Shabab fighters and Kenyan forces at Westgate but if the attack would have struck at Kenyan government facilities, I would have become cheerful because Kenyans, have invaded our country and maimed dozens of civilians in Kismayu. So, I think now it\u2019s a payback time. Hassan Mohamed Ali, student, 24 It is a very unfortunate that fighters claiming to be Jihadists to target a civil gathering place like Westgate, I am telling those who know little about Islam, that Islam is not a terrorism, Islam is a peaceful religion and those who committed this atrocities against civilians and innocents are not representing Islam, they are actually relegating the reputation of Islamic religion Nasra Hussein, shop keeper, 30 I have a lot of sympathy for the families and friends who have lost their lives at Westgate attack and hope quick recovery to those who were injured, on behalf of Somali women where ever they are, we are very sorry and feel sorrow for what happened in Kenya, We are expressing solidarity with Kenyan people for the barbaric attack Iidle Ali, pro Al-Shabab, 23 Bravo, Bravo, Al-Shabab has done good thing to Kenyan enemies, who have invaded our country without the consent of the people of Somalia, I think Kenyans are harvesting the consequence what they did to us This report from AP: President Barack Obama is telling the United Nations General Assembly that while the world is more stable than five years ago, the deadly terrorist attack on a shopping mall in Kenya \"indicates the dangers that remain.\" Obama said al-Qaida has splintered into regional networks and militias, and said that poses \"serious threats to governments, diplomats, businesses and civilians across the globe.\" This remarkable witness interview was conducted by the BBC's World at One: Bill Clinton is speaking in New York currently and has again paid tribute to Elif Yavuz who died in the attack. This from ABC news journalist Dana Hughes: LSE alumnus Ravindra Ramrattan was also killed in the attack on the Westgate mall. His friend, Josh Weinstein has cross-posted this tribute to the LSE's blog, which is extracted below: I found out yesterday that a friend was killed in the senseless, horrible attack in Nairobi. He was a great person and meant a lot to many people. He had a profound impact on so many people\u2019s lives that I would not even begin to understand how to chronicle it all.... I met Ravi early on in my time in Nairobi. I remember thinking that this guy was exceptionally smart. Subsequently, I found out he had bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, a masters degree in financial economics from Oxford, and another masters in econometrics and mathematical economics from the London School of Economics. After teaching statistics to graduate students at the London Business School for a year \u2013 at the tender age of 26 \u2013 he decided to move to Kenya to commit himself to the cause of poverty alleviation. When I heard the news, I was crushed. I was with my friend Sharon, who lived with Ravi for a few months in Nairobi. For two days, we felt helpless, having to watch from afar.... I find it deeply ironic that Ravi would end up having his life taken by the people he most wanted to help. Ramrattan was from Trinidad and Tobago. his local paper has covered his death here: Pleasant, humble and brilliant, Ravindra Ramrattan was a hero in his hometown of Munroe Road, Cunupia. When he won the President\u2019s Medal, Gold, in 2002, while a student at Presentation College, Chaguanas, the community celebrated with his family. When he migrated to study at renowned Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and later, the London School of Economics, the success story of this humble young man filled his neighbours\u2019 hearts with pride... Grieving mom Parbatie Ramrattan held on to a relative and cried, as the tragedy, thousands of miles away in Kenya, was reported on CNC3 and photos of the Trinidadian scholar flashed on the television screen. \u201cI never expected to be doing my son\u2019s funeral. I have two sons, (Ravi and Rajiv) to do our rites when we die, not us to do their rites,\u201d the devout Hindu woman cried. \u201cRavi left me too early. He should not have died now because he had so much to live for. He was an innocent victim in that situation.\" Local television news has also interviewed his parents. Here's an extract from the Daily Mail yesterday who report the heroic actions of an off-duty soldier: A former marine emerged as a hero of the Nairobi siege yesterday after he was credited with saving up to 100 lives. The ex soldier was having coffee at the Westgate mall when it was attacked by Islamists on Saturday. With a gun tucked into his waistband, he was pictured helping two women from the complex. The former soldier is said to have returned to the building on a dozen occasions, despite intense gunfire. A friend in Nairobi said: \u2018What he did was so heroic. He was having coffee with friends when it happened. \u2018He went back in 12 times and saved 100 people. Imagine going back in when you knew what was going on inside.\u2019 This video also appears to verify that the Westgate roof has partially collapsed in dramatic fashion due to fire damage. A very interesting series of tweets from a Kenyan user who reveals some possible further detail about the pall of smoke that engulfed the sky over the shopping centre yesterday. We haven't verified photos but the appear to match with previous details. The fire was said by Kenyan officials to have been started by militants using mattresses. These new photos, if verified, don't preclude this, but the fire appears to be coming from inside the building - later engulfing the roof of the parking lot and the cars above - evenutally collapsing part of the structure. Leaving the identity of a female attacker aside, the gender seems to be in little doubt according to witnesses at the mall. This is a report from Kenya's Star newspaper: Multiple survivors of the attack have narrated how a woman appeared to be giving orders to the attackers on Saturday afternoon... Two Radio Africa Group employees caught in the gun battle said a woman appeared to be giving orders. One said her face was covered but she had a woman's arms and body. She was not carrying a gun but had large bag around her waist. They said she would speak English in a foreign accent and then her orders would be translated into Swahili and the attackers would advance. \"The woman was not armed but as soon as she issued orders, the men would go on a killing rampage,\" one employee said. \"It was definitely a woman because we could tell it from the voice,\" said another employee. A further tweet from AP reporter Rania Khadr: Two tweets from reporters suggesting that there is some movement on the ground in the vicinity of the mall. Speaking in Pakistan, broadcast on the BBC, Home Secretary Theresa May has said, \"I'm aware of the reports that there has been a British woman involved. \"At this time until we've seen the investigation completed, It's not possible to comment further. As I indicated earlier, I'm not able to give further details.\" This from AP: An official tells The Associated Press that Nairobi's city morgue is preparing for the arrival of a large number of bodies of people killed in the Westgate Mall terrorist attack in Kenya. The government official says morgue employees were told to prepare for many bodies. Morgue employees were dressed in smocks early Tuesday, though no bodies had been delivered. The official death toll from the mall attack stood at 62. Most of those bodies were already taken to the morgue, either directly or from hospitals. A city resident whose brother is taking part in the military operation inside the mall told AP that there were many dead bodies still in the mall. Both the government official and the Nairobi resident insisted their names not be used so they would not face retribution from government officials. Henry McDonald our Ireland Correspondent gives some further background on Samantha Lewthwaite, originally from Northern Ireland. To stress, her involvement in the mall attack has in no way been substantiated. The Police Service of Northern Ireland gave Samantha Lewthwaite's grandmother a panic alarm if the fugitive Islamist convert tries to contact her. Family friends in Lewthwaite's native Banbridge said the publicity surrounding her role in extreme Islamist politics in recent years has deeply affected her grandmother who lives near the town centre. Elizabeth Allen is said to be devastated by the revelations regarding her grand-daughter. It is understood the stress on Ms Allen, who is in her late 80s, is such she was hospitalised recently. The frail pensioner previously told how she was issued with a panic alarm with which she was to contact police if Lewthwaite ever made contact with her. Lewthwaite would have been no stranger to the devastating effect of terrorism while growing up in the mainly unionist, County Down market town. Banbridge town was a repeated target of the IRA's bombing campaigns of the 1970s, 80s and early 90s. In one notorious incident a young school boy was killed by an IRA bomb that exploded in the town centre. The last bomb attack on Banbridge occured in 1998 when the Real IRA detonated a huge explosive device in the town a few months before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Another named victim is Kenyan RuhilaAdatia-Sood who was a popular radio and TV personality in the country. Her husband worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Nairobi. She was expecting a child. Peter Neumann and Alex Meleagrou-Hitchens from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation based in Kings College, give a fascinating analysis of al Shabaab and their international links: Westerners fighting for al Shabaab is not a new phenomenon. Since 2007, at least 50 people have gone from Britain to Somalia as foreign fighters. For the United States, the number is likely to be higher. Nationals of both countries have become suicide bombers on behalf of al Shabaab. The majority of foreign fighters continue to be ethnic Somalis, attracted by a mixture of national sentiment and global jihadist ideology. Still, there is a significant number of non-ethnic Somalis and even Muslim converts who have adopted al Shabaab\u2019s cause. The most prominent among them is Alabama-born Omar Hammami \u2013 aka Abu Mansoor al Amriki \u2013 who was among the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted. Though the trickle of foreign fighters has been steady, it is no longer the destination of choice for Western jihadists. Especially since 2012, Somalia and other destinations have been overtaken by Syria, with nearly 1,000 Europeans estimated to have gone in the past two years. Over the last few years, Al Shabaab has systematically reached out to Westerners. The group has run a sophisticated media campaign targeting English speakers, with well produced video clips presenting Somalia as the forefront in the global struggle against the \u201cCrusaders\u201d. Only two weeks ago, al Shabaab released a slick \u201cdocumentary\u201d, highlighting the stories of several Americans who are fighting with the group. \u201cThis is the real Disneyland\u201d, claimed one of them, imploring fellow American Muslims to join him. Once in Somalia, the foreign fighters\u2019 roles and responsibility vary. Many find it hard to blend into traditional Somali society, and their fighting abilities are limited. Instead, al Shabaab often uses their technological skills to help the group improve its propaganda output. If it turns out to be true that Westerners were involved in the Westgate attack, this would, therefore, be a significant departure. This is the latest report from AP news wire: The militant group that attacked a Nairobi mall and killed at least 60 people says it is still holding hostages alive inside and that its fighters are \"still holding their ground.\" The Twitter messages posted Tuesday by the al-Qaida-linked rebel group al-Shabab came after Kenyan government assurances of success in the fourth-day of the standoff. Al-Shabab says the hostages \"are still alive, looking quite disconcerted but, nevertheless, alive.\" A security expert with contacts inside said Monday night there were at least 30 hostages when the assault began Saturday and at least 10 were believed to be still inside the upscale mall. Officials did not give a figure, saying only that \"most\" hostages had been released. Sporadic gunfire could be heard from the building Tuesday as government forces pressed on inside. My colleague Ben Quinn last night filed this report on two further British victims. The UK death toll now stands at six: The father of an eight-year-old girl who was one of at least six Britons among the dozens killed during the terrorist attack and seige at the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, said her killers were \"animals \u2026 using religion as an excuse to kill people\". Louis Bawa, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, is understood to have lost his daughter, Jennah, and Kenyan-born wife, Zahira, in the attacks, which have left more than 60 dead. The businessman said that his heart had stopped when he identified them as he looked at photographs of the bodies that were still inside the mall. \"The people who did this, they are animals. They are using religion as an excuse to kill people,\" he said. \"Zahira and Jennah were Muslims, but these animals just shot them the same as all of the others. At first I was convinced that they would be OK. I had hope. Then on Sunday night there was a team that went in to bring out some bodies and they took photographs of other bodies,\" he said. Our France correspondent Angelique Chrisafis has sent through some further details about French victims of the mall attack: A French mother and daughter were among the first victims of the shopping mall attack after they were shot just after parking in the mall car-park as the assault began. Corinne Dechauffour, 54, and her daughter Anne Dechauffour, 27, were originally from Nice on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Corinne Dechauffour, lived most of the year in Kenya where her husband ran a hotel complex on a wild-life reserve. An artist, she sold paintings of Kenya wildlife and nature and sometimes exhibited in Nairobi galleries, French media reported. The family was well-known among French ex-patriots in Kenya. Anne Dechauffour had been on holiday visiting her parents. She had regularly spent time in Kenya since the family's move there when she was 12. A former languages student, she aspired to a career in acting, had taken acting classes in Paris and London and had signed a modelling contract in London. One of her former drama teachers told Le Parisien that as an actor she had a \"childlike voice\" and showed a certain childlike fragility. The mayor of Nice said he would pay tribute to the victims. The family still had a house in Nice where they spent holidays once a year. Two tweets which would suggest that operations are still ongoing. Former US president Bill Clinton has paid tribute to the wife of the Australian architect killed in Kenya. Tasmanian-born Ross Langdon and his wife Elif Yavuz were expecting their first child in just two weeks when they were gunned during the Westgate attack. The Harvard-educated Ms Yavuz worked with the Clinton Foundation during her doctoral studies and recently rejoined the institution as a senior vaccines researcher based in Tanzania. Mr Clinton, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and their daughter Chelsea say they were \"shocked and terribly saddened\" to learn of Ms Yavuz's death. \"Elif was brilliant, dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her terribly,\" they said in a statement. \"Elif devoted her life to helping others, particularly people in developing countries suffering from malaria and HIV/AIDS. \"On behalf of the entire Clinton Foundation, we send our heartfelt condolences and prayers to Elif's family and her many friends throughout the world.\" Peter Taylor, the BBC\u201ds terrorism expert, who happened to be in Kenya making a programme on the UK connections to al Shabaab has just spoken on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: He said he had spoken to Samantha Lewthwaite after 7/7 and recounted what she said. \u201cSamantha Lewthwaite the so called white widow has become an almost mythological figure and the search for her has been going on for her for a long long time. \u201cIt's interesting, I tried to interview her after the 7/7 bombings in which her husband was involved. And she said at the time, how these people could have turned her, i.e. her husband and poisoned his mind is dreadful. So at the time of the 7/7 bombings the impression was he disapproved, and was highly critical of her husband's actions. \u201cThen she sort of disappears off the radar and turns up again in Kenya and clearly it would appear she became involved with al Shabaab to fight jihad as her husband believed he was doing when he bombed the tube... \u201cIf it is true she was the white woman who [the foreign minster] Amina Mohamed said has done this many times before, we simply don't know.\u201d He added that she was definitely in Kenya at some point. Our correspondent in Nairobi Afua Hirsch has reported that the siege in which dozens of shoppers were killed and over 170 were injured, appears to finally be over. After entering its fourth day, Kenyan officials have declared that all hostages being held at the Westgate shopping mall are now free and that the military had taken back control the building from al-Shabaab militants. \u201cWe believe all hostages have been released\u2026situation of hostiles to be confirmed,\u201d a message on the Twitter account of the government\u2019s Disaster Operations Center said late Monday. There was confusion as a series of explosions continued to detonate at the five storey mall in the early hours of this morning. A source quoted by the Kenyan media said that the forces involved in the siege had now left the building, and that the incidents were controlled explosions as the General Services Unit sweep the complex for remaining explosives. \u201cA highly placed military source [said that the] hostage situation had been resolved,\u201d reported Kenya news channel KTN. This is the latest from AP news wire on the ongoing military operation to take back the mall from al Shabaab fighters. Kenyan security forces battled al-Qaida-linked terrorists in an upscale mall for a fourth day Tuesday in what they said was a final push to rescue the last few hostages in a siege that has left at least 62 people dead. Despite Kenyan government assurances of success on Twitter, another explosion and more gunfire could be heard coming from the mall at around 6:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Associated Press reporters at the scene said. Security forces carried a body out of the mall, which remained on fire, with flames and smoke visible. A Kenyan soldier wearing bomb disposal protective gear also exited the building. While the government announced Sunday that \"most\" hostages had been released, a security expert with contacts inside the mall said at least 10 were still being held by a band of attackers described as \"a multinational collection from all over the world.\" Somalia's al-Qaida-linked rebel group, al-Shabab, which claimed responsibility for the attack, posted an audio message on a pro-militant website late Monday that they were still in control of the building. \"Despite botched attempts by the Jews and Christians to recapture the mall today, the mujahideen are still in control of the Westgate,\" al-Shabab spokesman Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage said in the message. The foreign minister's statement about the gender and nationality of the attackers has again ramped up the belief that the British women involved in the mall attack is UK terrorism suspect Samantha Lewthwaite. Married to the 7 July bomber Jermaine Lindsay, Lewthwaite was named as a possible perpetrator on Monday by three major British newspapers and branded the \"white widow\". Lewthwaite is thought to be in east Africa and is currently wanted by Kenyan police over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country's coast. In March 2012 officials said she had fled to Somalia and that officers were hunting a woman who used several identities. Welcome to another day of the Nairobi mall siege, with still no confirmation that attackers have been cleared from the the Westgate complex, despite repeated claims from Kenyan ministers that a resolution is imminent. The interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku said on Monday night the evacuation of hostages had gone \"very, very well\" and officials were \"very certain\" there were few if any left in the building. The ministry said late on Monday night on Twitter it was \"in control\" of the complex. But early on Tuesday morning there more reports of gunfire and explosions. The main development overnight was the claim by Kenya's foreign minister, Amina Mohamed, that a British woman and 'two or three' Americans were among the attackers. In an interview with the PBS NewsHour programme in the US (remarks begin at 3m 54s) she gave few details, but the claim is sure to fuel further speculation about whether the woman was Samantha Lewthwaite. However this claim competes with earlier statements made by officials including the interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku who said that the attackers were all male but some may have dressed up like women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
