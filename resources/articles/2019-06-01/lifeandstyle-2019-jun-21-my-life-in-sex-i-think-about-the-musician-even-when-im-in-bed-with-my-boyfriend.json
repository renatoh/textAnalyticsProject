Meanwhile, I\u2019ve had a very intense crush on a famous musician for 15 years. Despite the fact that he is now bald and nearing 40, I am utterly obsessed. My boyfriend knows about my crush, but not the extent of it. I\u2019ve read, watched and listened to countless interviews with the musician, and feel I know almost as much about him as I do my partner. He\u2019s kind, creative, cultured, vegan and an animal lover \u2013 basically, everything that I look for in a man, and many things that my boyfriend is not. I am under no illusion that he and I will ever be together, but I fantasise constantly about us meeting, becoming lovers and eventually having a daughter together. I also think about him when I masturbate and, I\u2019m ashamed to say, even when I\u2019m in bed with my boyfriend. In a weird way, I am in love with him, even though he has no idea that I exist. My boyfriend and I are about to buy a house together, but I find myself dreaming of running away and finding a job in the same city as the musician, on the off-chance that we should meet. Our relationship has had more difficulties in the past year, and less sex, so perhaps my crush is acting as a surrogate for my emotional and sexual needs. As my daydreaming has intensified, I worry that my real sex life can never live up to the fantasy one. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
