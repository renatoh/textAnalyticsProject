Stumbling upon The Firebird Ball eight years ago was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my 16 years as a theatre critic. Punchdrunk re-make desolate spaces. They create scenes with such density of detail, such fleshy, smelly, tarnished and glorious particularity that they make most realistic designs look sketchy. They show that the wall between verisimilitude and fantasy is leaky. They dance their stories with limber expressiveness. These assets are displayed in The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable, even though this is one of their less startling creations. Directed by Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle in a former GPO sorting office next to Paddington station, it sends the audience roaming through a dusky space, spinning unguided through concentric circles of make-believe. You walk through a pine forest and tread desert sand. You mosey through the trailer park of the Temple Studios, peering into vans, one with a rumpled bed and overflowing ashtray, another filled with dolls. You glimpse the lives of actresses through the prism of medical prescriptions, tucked into brown envelopes, and dressing tables. A silver-backed hairbrush holds down a begging letter: \"It would mean the world to us if you would endorse our cold cream.\" You watch the filming of a sunny domestic romance in which, in front of matching cups and bread bin, a brand new wife shimmies around with a teatowel. As you sit on a tip-up scarlet seat in a pint-size but perfect movie house, waiting to watch Eyes Without A Face, these layers of fantasy collapse into each other. You see, swimming through the screen, audience members, poking around unawares, turned into celluloid celebrities. There is another element. I was blindfolded by a dark-shawled woman who muttered apocalyptic tales, and given a lucky charm by a wardrobe mistress whom I chased through a labyrinth of empty clothes. Neither of these encounters made it easier to excavate a story. Knowing that Woyzeck is one inspiration for the show may alert you to incidents of murder and drowning but does not give much narrative tug. Georg B\u00fcchner's grim 1837 tale is itself fragmentary. This is billed as Punchdrunk's biggest show, but the expansion is of square feet rather than imagination. The visual content is superb. Anyone who has never been Punchdrunked must attend. But it is not an advance for the company, who need to enlarge their acoustic and verbal vocabulary and move away from a horror lexicon. Devotees will find the physical and emotional landmarks of The Drowned Man familiar, and experience a sense of re-tread. Except perhaps when they consider the audience. The spectators are, after all, part of the show. They are, as usual, masked. Everywhere you look, grey, beaky faces shine implacably, contributing a last spooky circle. At the huge Faust in Wapping in 2006, these participant observers were tentative, liable to be unnerved. Now aficionados poke eagerly into a place, suss out whether there is any action and move on. They run. They follow the action in packs. They elbow. Maddeningly, some hold hands. They know how to winkle out a narrative. There is less baffled loitering and fruitful lingering. That is something of a loss. One of the distinctions of Punchdrunk was the way tiny episodes lay unobserved, waiting to be discovered. Not everything had to do with action. Spectacle threatens to overwhelm that distinction. Matt Charman has done something very clever in writing The Machine. The chess match between the Soviet genius Garry Kasparov and the chess computer Deep Blue, on which the play is based, is a tremendously dramatic confrontation, and one with cold war political resonance. It is full of extraordinary data, much of which is unobtrusively brought to light here. Yet it's fraught with difficulties as a stage play. It could be stuffily static. It could easily be reduced to an obvious, sentimental man-machine conflict. Charman makes it more interesting and surprising. In fleshing out the background of Kasparov \u2013 extraordinarily gifted, terribly pushed by an ambitious mother \u2013 he shows how nearly mechanised the life of a prodigy can become. In hinting at the biography of the Taiwan-born Feng-Hsiung Hsu, the brains behind Deep Blue, he makes the computer-fixated, awkward student so touching and so anxious \u2013 and so humanly truncated \u2013 that you almost want his machine to win. This turns out to be a play about outsiders transfixed and skewered by the United States, who are driven to a desperate game. Josie Rourke directs with pizazz, flashing screens and slow-motion, balletic encounters over the chessboard. The result, despite the title, is something peculiarly humane. It's the combination of global daring and local investigation that has made the Manchester international festival so indispensable. It mines the city, recovering its stories and finding out exceptional spaces in which to tell them. There could be no better place to hear The Masque of Anarchy than in the Albert Hall. The former Methodist meeting hall, now \u2013 hurrah \u2013 a nightclub, is steps away from the site of the Peterloo massacre, where in 1819 cavalry charged into a crowd assembled to call for parliamentary reform. Shelley's poem excoriating the rotten conditions that caused them to gather, culminates in a ringing call for resistance: \"Ye are many. They are few.\" For four nights the fine Bolton-born actress Maxine Peake gripped audiences with what seemed less like a recitation of Shelley's stanzas than their fiery incarnation. Staged by Sarah Frankcom, artistic director of the Royal Exchange, she spoke in front of a bank of candles to an audience who stood as if at a political meeting. In an empire-line white dress that alluded to the poem's date without looking like a costume, Peake began still, like a taper, clenched by the words. Then, gently pacing and stretching out her hands, she showed the poem to be not only eloquent expostulation but also an argument. She proved that dramatised poetry can enthral. The Masque of Anarchy points to another new theatrical possibility. \u2022 This article was corrected on Sunday 21 July. It originally referred to Maxine Peake as Mancunian.
