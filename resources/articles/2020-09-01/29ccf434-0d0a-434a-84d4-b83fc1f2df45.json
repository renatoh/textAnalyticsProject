Residents of the unincorporated town of Corbett in Multnomah county met with law enforcement officials on Saturday evening, after several people complained of being subjected to illegal roadblocks the previous night. Vigilante groups had sprung up on Friday afternoon, after the detonation of a firecracker led to a brushfire on private property that was quickly extinguished. Civilian residents, some heavily armed, set up at least two roadblocks with cars and household chairs, according to residents and recordings obtained by the Guardian. Drivers who were stopped said they were asked to identify themselves and their connection to the town and claimed that on at least two occasions, police were on the scene and did not intervene in the illegal traffic stops. One of those stopped, Latoya Robinson, had recently evacuated with her family from Sandy, Oregon, to what she thought would be the relative safety of Corbett, where she was staying with a friend. Robinson said she and her children were stopped in their car between 6.30 and 7pm on Friday at the junction of Louden and Littlepage Roads, at a roadblock with \u201cat least four vehicles\u201d parked nearby. Her description is confirmed by a cellphone video made of the aftermath of the stop by one of her children. The men who stopped her, most of whom were armed, were dressed in \u201chunting style clothes, camouflage\u201d, she said, and did not identify themselves or mention any legal authority under which they were acting. Robinson said she was questioned by a \u201cheavily armed\u201d man carrying a AR-style long gun and a visible sidearm. She said the man asked at one point: \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d which Robinson, who is African American, understood as having racist overtones. Eventually the men let her pass on to her friend\u2019s place. On her return journey, she was stopped again. She said she saw two Multnomah county sheriff\u2019s office (MCSO) cruisers stopped by the roadblock, and an officer talking with one of the people running it. She said the deputies did nothing to intervene in the illegal stop. Another local resident, who asked not to be named due to safety concerns, said she had been stopped on Friday evening in a similar fashion on Louden. She said she saw an MCSO cruiser driving in her direction, away from a second roadblock structure 50 yards ahead, leading her to assume that police were aware of the vigilante activities. Concerns over a town meeting Multnomah is the state\u2019s most populous county, taking in the city of Portland and points east, including outer-metropolitan Gresham and several unincorporated communities near the entrance of the Columbia River Gorge, including Bridal Veil, Orient and Corbett. Social media appeared to have played a central role in setting up the events in Corbett. Corbett\u2019s main (and private) local Facebook group last week was consumed with rumors of \u201cantifa\u201d militants traveling up into the Columbia River Gorge to set fires and destroy the town. On Friday, one member of the Corbett area group wrote: \u201cIt seems like the militants are burning out/up the rural folks closest to the cities because the only way they can fight is dirty vs the more conservative/rural folks would hand them their @$$es in an altercation.\u201d In response, a member who had been promoting an armed response wrote: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were thinking. At least most of us can mobilize and bring our arsenal with us.\u201d The same day, elsewhere, another wrote: \u201cResidents are guarding at the bottom of Louden on their own with the blessing of police \u2026 Police said to do what you must. I thank these residents for being our watchdog.\u201d The Multnomah county sheriff, Michael Reese, however, put out a video on Saturday warning residents to not set roadblocks or \u201cstand in a travel lane\u201d. Reese would go on to issue another statement on Friday\u2019s events later that night, saying: \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office will not tolerate illegal activity of any kind, including illegal roadblocks.\u201d Town residents gathered outside the Corbett fire station later that night. Videos on YouTube show a Corbett school board member, Todd Redfern, opening the meeting by referring to the previous night\u2019s events. \u201cA couple of people were upset that we were stopping them. I mean, we weren\u2019t stopping them, that we were there: they were upset we were there,\u201d Corbett told residents gathered in the car park of the Corbett fire station. Redfern ran through logistical details for further patrols. \u201cWe\u2019ve been running good and strong at both checkpoints, Louden and Larch Mountain, until the wee hours \u2013 two o\u2019clock or something,\u201d he said, according to the video. \u201cIf anybody here can actually come in at one o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock and release the guys until the next morning when more people can come, that would be greatly appreciated.\u201d A separate audio recording obtained by the Guardian documents the sheriff\u2019s sergeant Bryan White speaking after Redfern and echoing the sheriff\u2019s warning about setting up roadblocks. But White did not explicitly discourage further citizen patrols and went on to indicate that the MCSO would be comfortable with a range of actions that stopped short of that, saying that \u201copenly displaying firearms ... is not something we\u2019re gonna get excited about\u201d; that taking \u201cphotos of cars and even license plates\u201d could produce \u201ca great resource\u201d for police; and that \u201cstanding on the side of the road, parking on the side of the road, 20 deep, with signs and flashers on, that\u2019s fantastic\u201d. Instead of stopping cars, White says, residents can take pictures and record license plates. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to make folks know that they\u2019re being watched without actually standing in the middle of the road and making people feel like they are going to have to stop,\u201d White said. He added such actions may be useful to police, since \u201cif we need help later to track down a car, you guys are a great resource, as far as photos of cars and even license plates. If you want to sit there and write down license plates of cars as they drive by, obviously that\u2019s fine.\u201d Asked to clarify the meaning of \u201csuspicious\u201d, the deputy said \u201csuspicious is anything that feels out of place to you\u201d, adding \u201cyou know your neighborhood and know what your neighbor drives\u201d and \u201canything that feels out of place to you, just listen to your gut because nine times out of 10 your gut is right\u201d. White also warns that Oregon\u2019s strict laws on menacing have a low threshold. \u201cMost folks here have been around firearms long enough, have been responsible firearms owners and understand that you can still protect yourself with a firearm and do so in a tactful manner that does not necessarily draw attention to it right away, or make anybody else feel uneasy while you\u2019re having a conversation with them,\u201d he said. Hope Beraka, a local resident who attended the meeting, said she viewed it as a \u201crecruiting and organizing event\u201d for local vigilante groups and that she saw comments made by White as \u201can hour of encouragement\u201d for vigilante action short of roadblocks. The Multnomah county sheriff\u2019s office (MCSCO) said the meeting and the deputy\u2019s remarks were in no way meant to encourage vigilante patrols. \u201cMCSO does not support or tolerate such activity, and it is illegal,\u201d the department said. \u201cSgt White was asked to speak on our efforts to keep the community safe, through high-visibility and other special patrols, and to inform residents what they legally could and could not do,\u201d the department said. In response to further, detailed questions on White\u2019s remarks, and whether it would be better to explicitly discourage citizen patrols, MCSO said it would not comment without access to the full audio recording, provided by a confidential source, but it added: \u201cAt the onset of the reports of roadblocks on Friday night, we published a thread message on social media strongly discouraging the activity.\u201d Other residents were uncomfortable with the tenor of the meeting. At one point, a resident takes issue with the group and its methods. \u201cI own firearms, I believe in firearms, I believe in the second amendment. I also believe that an armed group of citizens is a militia. I also believe that checkpoints with armed citizens is against the law,\u201d he said. The man tells the group to \u201cdrop the guns\u201d, adding that \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe in my community\u201d before being shouted down and briefly approached by another man seeking to stop him from talking. Redfern, the school board member who addressed the meeting, did not respond directly to detailed questions about his role in the events and directed the Guardian to another resident who had been involved in the militia patrols. Fears of emboldened vigilantes Reports of vigilante activity in rural Oregon have multiplied as first responders struggle to keep up with the wildfire emergency, and baseless rumors that \u201cantifa\u201d arsonists are to blame spread rapidly on social media. On Thursday, a photojournalist reported being held up by armed men in Estacada, Oregon, and three journalists were confronted by civilians armed with assault rifles in Molalla. Several local residents told the Guardian the sheriff\u2019s office instructions to halt illegal stops had immediate effect, and that there had been no further checkpoints or roadblocks since Saturday\u2019s meeting. But some also said they were worried that the meeting would embolden armed vigilantism in a town where they say some nurse a profound suspicion of outsiders and newcomers, and others are openly racist. One local resident, who asked not to be named, citing safety concerns, said the incidents were in line with the experiences of her family and others, including people of color. \u201cThe more people we meet, especially people of color, the more we learn about these experiences. It\u2019s really disappointing,\u201d the resident said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
