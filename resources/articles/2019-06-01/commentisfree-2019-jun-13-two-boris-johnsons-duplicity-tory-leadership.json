This is how the numbers shake out: in a first round poll this morning, those who failed to clear a 16-vote threshold were eliminated. (Farewell, then, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey and Mark Harper. You have officially become answers to difficult quiz questions in years to come.) Johnson was the clear winner with 114 votes, with Jeremy Hunt trailing in second place with 43 votes. Further rounds will whittle the pack to two. That shortlist is then put to Conservative members, who expect to see Johnson\u2019s name on the ballot paper. MPs have signalled that they will oblige. Unless Johnson is disqualified by sudden scandal \u2013 always a possibility \u2013 he gets a bye to the final. The intervening knockout stages are about identifying the non-Johnson contender. When Jeremy Hunt launches himself as a \u201cserious leader\u201d, he obviously means \u201cmore serious than Boris\u201d. Sajid Javid was more explicit, describing Johnson as \u201cyesterday\u2019s news\u201d and inviting Conservatives to choose \u201ca new kind of leader \u2026 not just for Christmas, not just for Brexit\u201d. The private conversations and bidding wars going on around parliament are even more candid. It is all about who stands a chance against Johnson. There isn\u2019t an obvious answer. Some Conservative MPs have crossed into a place of such profound despair about their party\u2019s predicament that no practical, strategic argument can rival the comforting offer of a magician leader. Not all of Johnson\u2019s backers are convinced that he has the extraordinary voter magnetism sometimes attributed to him, but they believe he has more of that quality than anyone else in the contest. Crucially, they are tired: tired of arguing, of thinking about parliamentary numbers and deals and procedures. They want the bad feelings to go away. Johnson makes Tories feel good about being Tory in a way that few Tories can. I have been struck in recent days by how open some of Johnson\u2019s supporters are about their surrender to magical thinking about his prospects. I expect pushback when I suggest to MPs that the whole thing is an exercise in wishing away deep structural challenges, but often they don\u2019t deny it. I have heard the prospect of Johnson\u2019s leadership described by someone who endorses it as a \u201cdesperate measure\u201d. I have heard it described as the action of a team that is three-nil down with 10 minutes to go and as a \u201cHail Mary pass\u201d. For want of an actual plan, the Conservative party is preparing to clutch its special, talismanic charm and pray for a miracle. That is not an offer that is available to the other candidates. It gets even harder for whoever else makes it to the final round because he (and it is now guaranteed to be a man) would be competing against two people called Boris Johnson. One served as mayor of London from 2008-2016. He has liberal, metropolitan instincts \u2013 broadly pro-immigration, old-fashioned in his use of idiom, but a moderniser at heart. That Johnson was once celebrated by his party as the \u201cHeineken candidate\u201d because, in homage to the old advertising slogan, he could refresh parts of the electorate that other Tories couldn\u2019t reach. He won in the capital, a Labour heartland. Twice. Then there is 2016-2019 Johnson, figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, the ultimate Brexit-booster. He is a more aggressive, divisive figure \u2013 a partisan of nationalistic culture wars who has consorted with Steve Bannon, the notorious alt-right ideologue inside Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. This is the Johnson who compares Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and who defended the jibe yesterday as a bit of unvarnished plain-speaking \u2013 the kind of thing the public prefers to \u201cbureaucratic platitudes\u201d. This is post-truth, Trumpesque Johnson who threatens to take the UK out of the EU with no deal and to renege on financial commitments already made to Brussels. He would build an invisible wall and make Ireland pay for it. Both Johnsons are dispensing wild promises to Tory MPs behind closed doors. Moderates and former remainers have been led to understand that London Johnson is the real one; that he does truly understand the perils of no-deal Brexit, that his domestic policy agenda would not be some turbo-Thatcherite slash-and-burn charge to the right. On the contrary, a liberal social reformer would emerge to renew Conservatism for the benefit of people who feel economically left behind. Meanwhile, Trumpy Johnson is reassuring hardline Brexiteers that nothing is off the table \u2013 not even a prorogation of parliament \u2013 in the drive to get the UK out of the EU at any cost. He cuts taxes for high-earners and lights the bonfire of regulation that Eurosceptic ultras have always seen as the festive culmination of their drive for liberation from Brussels. This Johnson promises to win back voters from Nigel Farage. He is the one that most Tory members (including an unquantified caucus of newly arrived ex-Ukippers) seem to think they are getting. But the other Johnson is meant to lead a different kind of electoral recovery, shoring up seats that could be lost because pro-European Conservatives flock to the Lib Dems or stay at home on polling day. Self-styled \u201cOne Nation\u201d Conservatives and rightwing ultras each seem to think the other side is being taken for a ride, which suggests they all are. It is possible that this strategy will unravel before the end of the contest. Maybe enough people will be put off by the flagrant duplicity that a non-Johnson candidate can somehow navigate a path to victory. But with two Boris Johnsons running, and both likely to make the final round, the laws of probability alone point to someone of that name being our next prime minister. Who he really is, what, if anything, he believes, and what he might be capable of doing is anybody\u2019s guess. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
