After Jeremy Corbyn launched Labour\u2019s campaign with a rousing speech to activists in Manchester on Tuesday, promising to \u201ctransform Britain\u201d, Labour hopes the tax-and-spend policy will draw a clear dividing line with the Conservatives, by underlining its determination to relieve the pressure on cash-starved public services. While formal manifestos have not yet been launched, the education plans are the latest of a series of spending pledges made by Labour since the snap election was called \u2013 including raising the cap on NHS wages, and building up to a million new homes, many of them council houses. Corbyn and his aides believe a clear anti-austerity message will engage disillusioned voters who feel left behind \u2013 the \u201cjust about managing families\u201d Theresa May has also set her sights on winning over. But the Conservatives have repeatedly attacked Labour\u2019s economic credibility, with Philip Hammond and David Davis last week claiming to have identified a \u00a345bn \u201cblack hole\u201d at the heart of the party\u2019s spending plans. By reversing repeated cuts to the corporation tax rate made by the Tories since 2010, Labour believes it could fund a series of ambitious pledges, including: Abolishing university tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants for the poorest students. Pouring an extra \u00a35.6bn into the annual schools budget by 2021, to guarantee that five-, six- and seven-year olds will not be taught in classes of more than 30. Extending free adult education to allow workers to upgrade their skills. Restoring the educational maintenance allowance, paid to 16- to 18-year-olds in full-time study. In total, Labour claims the package of education measures, including schools funding and increasing the adult skills budget would cost \u00a36.7bn a year by the end of the parliament in 2020-21. They calculate this would still leave some revenue from the corporation tax rise to spend on other manifesto measures. In another bid to differentiate themselves from the Tories, Labour would also guarantee that no school would lose out from controversial reforms to the national funding formula, which has led to some headteachers warning parents they will have to lay off teachers. The government has been under sustained pressure over school finances, with funding per pupil projected to fall by 8% in real terms by 2020. A report by the Commons public accounts committee (PAC) in March said schools in England are facing the most significant financial pressure since the mid-1990s, with school leaders having to find \u00a33bn in savings over the next three years. The scathing report accused the Department for Education of failing to understand the plight of England\u2019s schools, which have already had to cut staff, maintenance costs, IT investment and pastoral services to meet rising costs. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cWe believe that lifelong learning and education is the real ticket to ensure that our workforce in a post-Brexit economy can reach its full potential.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are not interested in cutting corporation tax to levels that are unsustainable when our public services are at crisis point. It\u2019s about investing in our young people.\u201d Rayner said the National Education Service title was a deliberate echo of the National Health Service, with its cradle-to-grave provision, free at the point of use. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has repeatedly said that he will reverse the tax giveaways to companies, which have seen the corporation tax rate, which is levied on profits, fall from 28% in 2010, to 19% today, with more cuts scheduled to take effect in future years. But Wednesday\u2019s announcement is the first time Labour has revealed the full details of its plans, which would see the corporation tax rate increase gradually, to 26% by 2020-21. Small businesses would pay a lower rate. That would still be the lowest level in the G7 group of advanced industrial countries; but the Conservatives are likely to seize on the planned tax rise as evidence Labour policies would frighten away foreign investors as the economy gears up for Brexit. Separately, Labour would increase investment in schools by up to \u00a320bn \u2013 funded through extra borrowing \u2013 to ensure that enough pupil places are available and buildings are brought up to scratch. Labour hopes to get its campaign \u201cgrid\u201d back on track with the education announcement, after Corbyn and his team came under pressure on Tuesday over Brexit. The Labour leader said in his speech in Manchester that the issue of Brexit had been settled. Asked repeatedly afterwards by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg whether Britain would leave the European Union \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d, Corbyn said: \u201cPeople know that there\u2019s been a referendum and a decision was made a year ago. We\u2019ve set out very clearly our terms for negotiations.\u201d Senior Labour sources said Corbyn had not been trying to reopen the issue of whether Brexit should go ahead, but simply to emphasise that he disagrees with Theresa May\u2019s insistence that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Labour\u2019s parliamentary party was deeply split by Corbyn\u2019s decision to impose a three-line whip on MPs, urging them to back the government bill triggering article 50, the formal process of leaving the EU. With the election campaign underway, Labour is keen to move the debate on from Brexit, to the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and its determination to bust the \u201ccosy cartels\u201d running Britain. With just less than a month to go until the 8 June vote, the Labour leader unveiled the party\u2019s battle bus on Tuesday, emblazoned with the election slogan \u201cfor the many not the few\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt this country is being held back,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cIf your children are not getting the education they deserve because the class sizes are too high, then your children are being held back. If you\u2019re a young couple, anyone trying to get a home, and can\u2019t make a home because rent and house prices are too high, then you\u2019re being held back.\u201d He presented a resolutely upbeat tone despite the Conservatives overwhelming poll lead, which stood at 22 points in the latest Guardian/ICM poll. At the rally in Manchester, and a subsequent stump speech in Salford, Corbyn insisted Labour can still win the general election and urged activists to take the party\u2019s message to the voters. The Liberal Democrats have also launched their flagship education pledge, promising to invest an additional \u00a37bn in schools and colleges. Like Labour, the party said their extra cash would protect per pupil-funding in real terms and guard schools against any losses from the re-shaping of the national funding formula. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron will launch the policy at a primary school in Cornwall on Wednesday, with the extra funds released by a pledge to reverse corporation tax cuts and the Conservatives proposals for funding new grammar schools. The marriage tax allowance, introduced as part of the Lib Dems coalition deal with the Conservatives, would also be scrapped, the party said. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said the money would reverse \u201ccrippling Conservative cuts\u201d that left schools in perilous financial states. \u201cWhile funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThis extra \u00a37bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.\u201d Farron also announced on Tuesday that girls would be provided with free sanitary products in schools under a Liberal Democrat initiative that the party has said would end the hidden problem of \u201cperiod poverty\u201d \u2013 where teenagers miss school because they cannot afford pads or tampons. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn can\u2019t deliver any of this \u2013 they\u2019re just made up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans. He\u2019s spent this damaging tax rise on businesses on 12 different things and he\u2019s already dropped numerous things he\u2019s said he\u2019d do before. The Lib Dems are no better and won\u2019t even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
