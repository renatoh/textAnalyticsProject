Just how much can a man take before he must simply walk away? And what kind of strength enables one man to lay down his life for another? The story revolves around the field court martial of a young Irish volunteer, Joseph Flanagan, who has apparently deserted - a capital crime. Flanagan offers no defence other than to say that he got lost, came across some wine in a barn and got drunk. One of the officers presiding over the court martial, who has his own demons, attempts in vain to intervene. The remarkable truth will only emerge many years later through the dogged detective work of a Gilbertine monk who himself has to delve into the carnage of war and witness both the limits of human endurance and the enduring spirit of sacrifice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
