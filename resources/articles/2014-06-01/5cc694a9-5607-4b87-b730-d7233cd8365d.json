Mickey Rourke and his big mullet\u2019", "bodyText": "So Jimmy, if you\u2019re talking to Small Talk you must have something to plug. What is it? I\u2019ve got a book out, mate. It took a lot for me to do it because I was wondering why anyone would want to read my stories. I\u2019ve just played football all my life and I really didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d get out of the book, but after I\u2019d spoken to Gersh [Gershon Portnoi], who helped me to write it, five or six times I thought that it might be great to do a book, to share my story and just see how it goes, really. So how is it going? Now it\u2019s all finished, I\u2019m quite pleased that I have done it. I suppose when it\u2019s your own life you don\u2019t realise what you\u2019ve achieved and what you\u2019ve done until you\u2019ve stepped out and looked back. Doing this book reminded me that, for a bloke who started out in life as a painter and decorator, I\u2019ve achieved some great things and done some stuff I\u2019d always wanted to do. I\u2019ve had some great times. On the day your book was released, you were sandwiched between Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and Mike Tyson in the Top 10 of the Amazon sporting autobiographies bestseller list. Is that a place you\u2019re comfortable? Really? Well, Ronnie\u2019s one of my idols, so that\u2019s blinding and Mike Tyson\u2019s an absolute nutcase, so \u2026 I suppose I fit nicely in the middle of them two. So why should people buy your book instead of theirs? Well it\u2019s not for me to tell people what to spend their money on, but mine\u2019s a largely lighthearted book with a few serious bits in it. It was quite an emotional experience doing it because I had a lot of bad times as well as good times in my career. It also has that \u2018dream factor\u2019 of a young lad realising his ambition of becoming a top-flight footballer. I\u2019ve had some great times with some top, top managers and I haven\u2019t held back on anything apart from the time I went to battle with Hull in court, because I signed a document which means I can\u2019t talk about it. What did you make of Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s recent moan about not getting enough respect from his Manchester City overlords on his birthday? Well if he really did say those things \u2026 I dunno, if there was a player in my dressing room who moaned about that, I would destroy him. If Yaya has said that, it is outrageous. There must be something else behind it because I\u2019m just not having it that he\u2019s got the hump because the boys ain\u2019t celebrated his birthday. Bend It Like Bullard is jam-packed with tales of dressing-room pranks and japes you were behind. Would it be fair to say that a lot of your team-mates just found you really tiresome? Yeah, definitely. I fell out with a couple. It\u2019s about managing people and knowing what you can get away with, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not exactly going to do a prank on the hardest player at your football club, when you know he\u2019s going to give you a wallop. But you, ahem, tea-bagged Papa Bouba Diop. The man is a monster. [Laughs] Yeah, good point. I was pushing the limits there, but overall, I think I was quite aware of what I could and could not get away with. Then there was the time you were at Wigan and your manager Paul Jewell slammed your head in a door. Yeah, Paul was the manager I had who lost it the most. Even if he was winning, sometimes he\u2019d rollock you \u2026 it must be the hot Scouser in him. He was always ready to flip, especially when I went to Ipswich and we lost nearly every game, which meant he was boiling every day. But back in his Wigan days, we won a lot so everything was great. You don\u2019t seem to have had much time for Fabio Capello or his methods, even though he called you up to the England squad. Well, he just didn\u2019t seem to have a lot of methods. I don\u2019t know if it was lost in translation or he found it hard to get his point across, but when I was with England he only spoke to me once or twice. I think it was two sentences, one of which was about golf. In two weeks that ain\u2019t a lot, especially when I was the new kid who had only just come in there. And as for his methods on the pitch, I\u2019ve got to say there weren\u2019t a lot there. But who am I to criticise Capello, because he\u2019s obviously a great manager. This is just me saying what I see and what I felt at the time. I could be wrong. Do footballers actually enjoy representing England and all the hoopla it entails? Yeah, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a player that plays for England and doesn\u2019t enjoy it, because it\u2019s an ambition that\u2019s at the top of every footballer\u2019s list: play for your country. In theory, yes. But the whole experience of being away from home and holed up in a hotel for weeks at a time, constantly being told what to do and when to do it, sounds like a bit of a drag. Well, I can only speak for myself, because I haven\u2019t heard it from anyone else\u2019s lips, but I did find that aspect of it hard. That\u2019s why I have the utmost respect for Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard and David Beckham, who have travelled the world and amassed so many caps, because even though I was only there for two weeks, I did find it difficult. You\u2019re in that hotel \u2013 and it\u2019s a lovely hotel \u2013 where you eat when you\u2019re told and you can\u2019t really do your own thing \u2026 but that\u2019s the profession, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s where your professionalism comes in and I was probably lacking a little in that department. I loved being part of the England set-up and would love to have had more time in it, but I did find it tough. The great outweighs the tough, but I\u2019m just trying to give a little bit of insight into how I found it. If Capello had promised you an England cap on condition you shaved off your long golden tresses, would you have done it? Oh, 100%. Of course I\u2019d have done it, but he didn\u2019t even give me that option. He didn\u2019t even offer me that. After retiring, you tried to make it as a golf pro. Why haven\u2019t we seen you playing in the Ryder Cup or featuring in the news for breaking off your engagement to a famous tennis player? Because I\u2019m not that good. I qualified on the EuroPro Tour last year and gave it a little bash, but to be fair I\u2019ve barely picked up a golf club in three months because I\u2019ve been bang on my fishing. It\u2019s either fishing rods or golf clubs for me, one or the other. What\u2019s the biggest fish you\u2019ve ever caught? A 22lb carp in Gold Valley Lakes in Aldershot. I caught one yesterday that was about 18lb. Fishing seems a bit of a sedate pastime for somebody as hyperactive as you appear to be. Ah, you\u2019d think that, wouldn\u2019t you, but I do competitions. It\u2019s match fishing, where you\u2019re very active and always thinking about your next move. It\u2019s quite intense. What\u2019s the last book you read, that isn\u2019t Bend It Like Bullard? I\u2019ve never read a book. Really? I\u2019m a magazine man. I read Match Fishing magazine, Pole Fishing magazine, Angling Times, Golf World and Golf Monthly. What\u2019s the last movie you saw? The Wolf of Wall Street. What did you make of it? Blinding! Small Talk thought it was about an hour too long. I loved it. It weren\u2019t long enough for me. What\u2019s your favourite biscuit? The ones with the fruity edges and the raisins in. I can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re called. Small Talk once spent a very pleasant and boozy afternoon in The One Bell, which is your father\u2019s pub in Crayford. If you\u2019d been there and we were getting the drinks in, what would you have? You were in my dad\u2019s pub? Yes. What did you think of it? It\u2019s a grand spot with a nice big beer garden, although there\u2019s possibly one framed John Terry shirt too many hanging on the wall. But there\u2019s only one John Terry shirt hanging on the wall. Exactly. Anyway, what\u2019s your poison? I only drink Smirnoff Ice. The drink of choice for 14-year-olds everywhere. I\u2019m not a big beer drinker. Smirnoff Ice is my tipple and I\u2019m pissed after about three of them. How much is a pint of milk? I don\u2019t know, but would guess about \u00a31.89. You\u2019d be getting fleeced if you paid that, Jimmy. Nah, it\u2019s just that I buy the proper stuff. Who or what would you put into Room 101? Flared trousers. Miley Cyrus or Rihanna? Blimey \u2026 [long pause] \u2026 Rihanna. Cheese or chocolate? Cheese. What\u2019s the last record, CD or download you bought? Hideaway by Kiesza. What\u2019s your favourite TV show? Celebrity Juice at the minute. Have you ever knocked a man out? Clean out, yeah. Was it anyone we might know? Yeah, Nick Barmby. What is your favourite pie filling? Apple. Who would play you in the movie of your life? Small Talk is thinking Jennifer Lawrence for the Peterborough United and early Wigan years, then Goldie Hawn for the rest. Now why would you say that? No reason. I want Mickey Rourke to play me. Mickey Rourke and his big mullet. OK, thanks for your time, Jimmy. Thank you. \u2022 Bend It Like Bullard by Jimmy Bullard is out now on Headline books."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
