Rodrigo Rato, the former Spanish finance minister, issued the warning as oil prices hovered at a 13-year high amid worries about the security of supplies after attacks in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. In its world economic outlook, released last month, the IMF estimated the global economy would grow at about 4% this year and next year on the assumption of oil prices of $30 a barrel. Current prices are well above that. US light crude eased nine cents to $38.8 a barrel from yesterday's close at $38.9. That was the highest closing price on the New York mercantile exchange (Nymex) since October 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait. London's Brent crude slipped nine cents to $35.8 after hitting a 13-year high of $36 yesterday. The IMF says the current rise in oil prices has been caused by stronger demand, which would not in itself derail recovery. But the organisation has expressed worries that there is not enough slack in supplies to withstand the withdrawal of a single major supplier - a possibility because of tensions in the Middle East and elsewhere. Those concerns have been underlined by recent events. Islamist militants launched an attack on foreign workers at a petrochemical plant in the Saudi city of Yanbu on Saturday, and US forces fought off a suicide bombing mission 10 days ago at Iraq's Basra oil export terminal. The situation in Iraq has not helped. Iraqi oil production has climbed past 2m barrels a day but recovery has been slower than expected, owing in part to lack of investment and incidents of sabotage. Current maximum capacity is estimated to be about 2.8m barrels a day, still well short of the 3.5m barrels a day back in 1979. With the US still importing over 2m barrels a day from the Gulf - more than 10% of its total oil consumption - its economy is highly vulnerable to even a modest disruption in supply. With petrol pump prices hitting $2 a gallon in some areas, oil prices are already an election issue. Analysts at Deutsche Bank estimate the rise in oil prices since late 2003 has cut at least $25bn, or about 0.25% of GDP, from US consumers' wallets. \"This amount appears moderate in the context of a rapidly expanding economy that is just beginning to generate sizeable job gains,\" Deutsche Bank said in a briefing note. \"However, these direct impacts on consumers' pocketbooks do not include the indirect effects on consumer and business confidence. \"Large spikes in oil prices have preceded the last four recessions.\" However, Deutsche Bank analysts say oil prices will drop to $30 a barrel by the end of the year and $28 a barrel in 2005. That would more than reverse the oil price increases this year. The president of Opec, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, sought to soothe market fears but declined to say whether the oil cartel would raise production limits when it meets in Beirut on June 3. He said he was in contact with the Opec secretariat, which was trying to determine the reason for the high prices. Mr Purnomo said, \"We have a leakage at 1.5m barrels per day above official quota. We assure the market that there is enough oil.\" The 10 Opec members with quotas pumped 25.7m barrels per day in April, cutting production by 360,000 barrels from March and going some way towards implementing a cartel agreement to reduce production, according to a Reuters survey. However, the survey found that leakage above the quotas rose to 2.2m barrels per day last month after Opec decided to lower output limits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
