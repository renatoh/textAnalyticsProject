We want to know. Send us a review of between 300 and 350 words of a film, album or concert that inspires (or annoys) you this summer, and you could win a \u00a325 National Book Token, as well as the chance to write for G2. We'll be judging the competition in eight different categories: film, pop, visual art, theatre, TV, classical music, dance and architecture. Each category will be judged in two age groups: under-14s and 14 to 18-year-olds. Our judges will be looking for powerful, persuasive voices, with original opinions and a flair for expressing them. This year's judges include: Kick-Ass screenwriter Jane Goldman; dancer Akram Khan (both pictured); singer-songwriter Emmy the Great; playwright Lucy Prebble; director Katie Mitchell; artist Susan Philipsz, winner of the 2010 Turner prize; novelist Anthony Horowitz; architect Ted Cullinan; pianist James Rhodes; and creative director of the BBC, Alan Yentob. You should review something new or recent in your chosen category (though we'll make an exception for architecture, which can be new or old). Your review can have appeared in a school magazine or local paper, but not before January this year. It should not have been published in a national newspaper or website. Our 16 finalists will each win a \u00a325 National Book Token, a Guardian young critic certificate, and have their review published on theguardian.com. One overall winner will also attend an event with a Guardian critic and write about it for G2.To enter, download the application form (pdf), fill it in and send it to us (Young arts critic competition, Arts desk, Guardian News and Media Ltd, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London, N1 9GU), along with three copies of your review. You'll also find details of free and discounted events across the UK, a full list of this year's judges, last year's winning entries and top tips on writing a review from the Guardian's team of critics on the website. The deadline is Friday 26 August 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
