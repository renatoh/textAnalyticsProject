But for some, coordinating cosmetics is no longer just for dressing up. In September the Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams and her boyfriend Reuben Selby attended designer Thom Browne\u2019s show in Paris wearing not only matching socks and coordinated check suiting but also identical pink eyeshadow. It\u2019s a look favoured by the K-pop couple HyunA and E\u2019Dawn, who often match their eyeshadow. Arguably, Brooklyn Beckham and his then girlfriend Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz were ahead of the trend when both sported black eyeliner while celebrating her 21st in 2018, in what Vogue dubbed \u201cthe ultimate couples move\u201d. And, after both dyeing their hair blond, Dua Lipa and Anwar Hadid opted to get matching manicures last month. The trend for makeup twinning relies on both halves of a couple being makeup wearers \u2013 and so, for some same-sex pairs, this is nothing new. But as gender stereotypes fade, heterosexual couples are also getting involved. Meanwhile, makeup brands are expanding their offerings: Mister from Givenchy \u201ccomprises unisex products for the eyes and complexion that bring instant and natural makeup results\u201d while the Jecca Blac range is dedicated entirely to genderless products. Asos now lists its cosmetics under a gender-neutral Face + Body section. \u201cWe have certainly seen a recent increase in couples shopping for cosmetics together. And, as a business, [we] take a gender-neutral approach when it comes to makeup,\u201d says Gemma Mason, head of customer experience at Superdrug. The men\u2019s makeup industry has been growing for some time. As far back as 2013 big names such as Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs launched male cosmetics ranges. But the more recent shift, which has been coined the \u201cbeauty boy movement\u201d, involves men and boys not only defining eyebrows and highlighting their cheeks but also becoming the faces of makeup brands and lines. The YouTube star James Charles, who has more than 16 million subscribers, became the first ever CoverGirl coverboy in 2016. The beauty vlogger Lewys Ball became a face of Rimmel\u2019s London campaign in 2017 and Jake Jamie, who hoped to catalyse the blurring with his #makeupisgenderless campaign, was signed to L\u2019Oreal in the same year. These shifts in expected gender roles have had a real-life effect \u2013 and Jessica Blackler, founder of Jecca Blac cosmetics, agrees that it is a rising trend. \u201cWhen we exhibit and host events, I have noticed a lot of couples shopping together and making sure shade and colours suit them both before purchasing items,\u201d she says. \u201cThe gender-neutral approach to beauty is definitely becoming more mainstream. [Couples] sharing and coordinating with each other is a way of enjoying it together.\u201d And it is not just for couples on the red carpet either. \u201cTom started wearing makeup about a year ago, but I have always loved transforming my face,\u201d says Chelsei, a hair salon manager in Melbourne, Australia, who posts pictures of her and her boyfriend in matching makeup on Instagram (via @_zaftig__). \u201cHe decided he wanted some black eyeliner, then that turned into eyeshadow, which turned into us doing matching looks when we go out.\u201d She says the reaction from friends has been \u201csuper-encouraging\u201d and that the pair now share makeup products; their favourite brands include Jeffree Star, Kat Von D and Morphe. For Daniel Osei, a student in Virginia, in the US, wearing matching makeup is a more recent venture. \u201cIt was her idea,\u201d he says of his girlfriend, JaLynn Evans, also a student. \u201cShe\u2019d always told me that I would look good with makeup on.\u201d The pair wore a matching look created by Evans for recent photos, also posted on Instagram. \u201cAll of our friends online loved it because they support the art form of makeup and are very open to new ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cIn real life, I got mixed responses initially but after a while people started to admit they really liked the shoot.\u201d The rise in couples coordinating their makeup is a win for \u201cgender-expansive identities\u201d, says Laura Kraber, chief executive and co-founder of the inclusive makeup brand Fluide. She says they are \u201cinspiring all of us to be more connected to our loved ones and more playful in both our relationships and our style\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
