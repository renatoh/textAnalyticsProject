Splashed across the front page, it celebrates David Cameron's weekend pledge \"to overhaul the tax and benefit system in favour of marriage as part of a Conservative crusade to mend Britain's 'broken society'.\" It is rare for the Mail, intent on frightening Cameron off the centre ground into their wilderness of daily wails, to give him unequivocal support. His marriage policy is their victory, boxing him into their own moral agenda without any idea yet how it can be done, at what cost - and with what collateral damage. Inside the Cameron tent there is a note of repressed panic as Gordon Brown's first fortnight has proved disappointingly sure-footed. They were planning for clumsy calamity, expecting Brown the tribal centraliser to hand them victory on a plate. Instead, Brown has bounced in the polls before he has even done much. Disconcertingly, his first announcements have given away power instead of seizing it. Cameron's people have had to tear up their battleplans. Short of something turning up - a deadly security lapse, a bubble bursting on Wall Street, some Brown fatal error - what are they to do now? Cameron admitted at the weekend with dangerous honesty that \"It's not now necessary to mend Britain's broken economy\", and instead marched straight on to Mail home turf: \"But it's absolutely necessary to mend Britain's broken society.\" Here the Conservatives must decide. Do they plunge back to their comfort zone and delight the Daily Mail with a moral crusade against the sins of Breakdown Britain caused by the \"smug liberal consensus\"? Or do they keep on their present uneasy course towards liberal modernity, even though the journey makes them seasick? Captain Cameron is now tacking in both directions at once, appeasing the Mail with marriage, but letting in the liberal sunshine at the same time. Marriage may be the rock on which society is founded, but it could well be the rock on which Cameronism founders. Here is why the Breakdown Britain theme is a dangerous temptation. Most people are easily persuaded that everything is getting worse, the young are decadent, morals and manners are in freefall, community is collapsing, children are neglected, family is fragmenting and nothing is what it was in a golden age imagined somewhere safely beyond memory, in our grandparents' youth. It is the human condition to believe in perpetual decline. All societies have \"something deeply wrong\" with them, and Cameron's marriage talisman captures strong political emotions. But the more he hammers away at this theme, the more he loses his drive for modernity and falls captive to the praise of the Mail and Telegraph. They brandish those other Tory seductions - tax cuts and immigration. Of course people want to pay less tax: New Labour feared it so much it pledged no income tax rise in every manifesto. Immigration is an issue ripe for a deft politician to exploit with the right language: porous borders, student and visitor visas from Muslim countries, terror suspects stopped from deportation by human rights, a housing crisis, Poles undercutting working-class wages - all these are tempting for an astute opposition. Tories who want Cameron to steer towards these strong, familiar fishing grounds may not be wrong. They say Michael Howard ran aground because he was something of the night, but sunshine Dave might make headway, couching these issues in socially acceptable tones. That's the siren song that beckons him in these choppy times. However, although reactionary mood music may play well, it would be hard to devise actual policies that would bear election-time public scrutiny. Take a brief look at his marriage bonus, and the nonsense at its heart is brutally exposed. More money for married families means less for children of single parents who are much the poorest. If it's a small sum, it will have no \"incentive\" effect. If it's large enough to push couples up the aisle, children of single parents will fall even further behind the rest. The child abandoned by its father suffers, while the philandering father marrying for the fourth time gains. Cameron says married parents are far more likely to stay together, but it doesn't need a professor of logic to spot the flaw: making cohabitees marry to collect a bonus is unlikely to sprinkle fairy dust and turn them into the same people as those who are already married. Almost everyone wants a lifelong good relationship, yet many fail. Now the small-state party that says governments can't run a whelk stall suddenly imagines the state can control the most wayward of human behaviours and superglue parents together for ever. Look at strict societies that succeed - and shudder. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says there are only two methods. A transferable marriage allowance (basic rate only) for married couples with children under six would give a non-working wife \u00a31,000 a year, costing \u00a31bn for existing couples. That helps the already married middle classes most. Or the same \u00a31bn could pay an extra \u00a315 a week in working family tax credits to the married with children. That restricts it to lower earners - but is it only the lower orders that need marriage? People who already lose so much money when they separate won't be deterred for these sums. Nor will this stir some puritan moral revival. But is it an election winner? Middle-class wives at home would like the transferable marriage allowance, but will they like the rhetoric? Who doesn't know someone left alone with children through no fault of her own? The Mail's Melanie Phillips praises what she calls \"Mr Duncan Smith's great insight\" that poverty \"is not at root an economic issue. It is a moral issue\". Drink, drugs, teen pregnancy and single parenthood are the cause of poverty, not caused by it. This policy maroons Cameron on blame-the-poor island, ending his brief flirtation with poverty alleviation. This grand plan to remoralise the poor has dishonourable antecedents stretching back into the mists of time: it may appeal to that solid 30% of core Tory voters, but even they, like the Queen, have children and grandchildren who have failed the great marriage ideal. And can Cameron explain why, if single parenthood causes poverty, Denmark has the same single-parent rate but the least child poverty in the EU? polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
