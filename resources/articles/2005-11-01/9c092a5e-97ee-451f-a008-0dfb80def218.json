Best, who has been in hospital since the beginning of October, underwent a liver transplant in 2002 after years of heavy drinking. One of Best's doctors, Akeel Alisa, later told reporters his patient was critical but stable. \"We are following all medical avenues to try to keep him stable,\" he said. \"He is ventilated so he is not conscious.\" The former Northern Ireland international, 59, was admitted to hospital after having a reaction to the treatment he was receiving for his new liver and then suffered internal bleeding linked to a bowel infection. After initial warnings that Best was close to death, his condition improved after a change in medication, although he remained in hospital. The Belfast-born Best was regarded by many as the greatest player to come from the British Isles. He had a dazzling career at Manchester United, winning the European Cup in 1968 when he was named European Footballer of the Year. His career nosedived when he left United aged just 26, however, and he has remained dogged by alcohol problems since."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
