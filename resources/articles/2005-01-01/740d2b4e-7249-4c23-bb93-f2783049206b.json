The club's chairman Dave Whelan says the cost of policing at the JJB Stadium far exceeds what nearby sides have to pay for similar fixtures and fears the row could cost the club promotion to the Premiership. He has refused to pay recent policing bills. The dispute has escalated to the point where the police have threatened to close the ground and Whelan has threatened to lock out the fans. He has asked for support from the sports minister Richard Caborn and two MPs. \"Two years ago a new superintendent trebled the cost of policing at the stadium and it has come to a head because they refused permission for the Wolves game to be in front of Sky and now the Leeds game as well,\" said Whelan. \"We want desperately to get to the Premiership and television exposure is important in raising our profile. \"For example, when we played Nottingham Forest in front of a crowd of 12,000 they charged \u00a319,878, while for Preston against Forest the fee was \u00a32,584.\" Whelan countered Superintendent Peter Mason's point that Preston was not in Greater Manchester with the claim that Bolton Wanderers paid less for the policing of larger crowds. \"When Bolton played Liverpool in front of a crowd of 27,880 the cost for policing was \u00a39,000 and for Bolton against Aston Villa the cost was \u00a310,000 for a crowd of 26,000,\" Whelan said. \"We are entirely consistent with ACPO [Association of Chief Police Officers] policy in the way we charge for stewarding matches,\" assistant chief constable Steve Thomas said yesterday. \"We have been advised we may have to stop providing a police service at Wigan matches if we are forced to commence debt recovery proceedings. We sincerely hope it doesn't come to this.\" Football League clubs spent about \u00a35m on agents' commissions in the second half of last year, according to figures the League will publish today. The sum represents a massive increase on the \u00a31.4m the 72 Football League clubs paid agents in the first six months of 2004. It is believed that 30% -about \u00a31.5m - of the latest total was paid out by Leeds alone, who mandated agents to find clubs for their high-earning players after they were relegated. \"Those costs were incurred in sorting out the players that left Leeds United,\" said Leeds' chairman Gerald Krasner. \"We have saved many times over the amount spent on agents' fees. Due to the one-off payments to agents, we have managed to reduce the annual wage bill from \u00a343m to \u00a318m. The amount spent on agents will be hugely reduced for the next six months.\" Leeds paid no agents' fees to process the sale of Alan Smith to Manchester United, since the Premiership club is committed to honouring a commission of \u00a3750,000 payable in three tranches over the duration of the striker's contract. Steve Claridge is to leave Brentford after less than a month. The 38-year-old striker has not scored a goal in his four games for the London club and recently has been left on the bench. He has agreed to a one-month loan at Wycombe with a view to earning a longer-term contract. Ian Richardson has been rewarded for his success as caretaker manager at Notts County with a contract until the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
