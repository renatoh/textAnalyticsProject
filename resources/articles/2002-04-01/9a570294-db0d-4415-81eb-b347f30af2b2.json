The striker's club Paris St-Germain are asking for \u00a317m but Liverpool have tabled a bid closer to \u00a312m. A source who helped broker Anelka's loan move to Liverpool in December said a deal was close to completion. \"Negotiations are ongoing but both parties are not very far apart,\" he said. \"Contrary to what has been said and written, Nicolas is happy at Liverpool, his coach G\u00e9rard Houllier has been pleased with his contribution and the wages are certainly not an issue. \"Once a fee can be finalised that is in the best interests of both clubs I expect the transfer to go through. But I would again like to emphasise that the problem does not lie with Nicolas. He wants to sign for the club.\" Liverpool's coach Phil Thompson was confident that the deal would be concluded, though the club are still keen to conclude a deal for Auxerre's Djibril Ciss\u00e9, who is also likely to cost about \u00a315m if he can be persuaded to leave France. \"Nicolas has done great by us and we are still hoping everything will come off,\" he said. \"He has been good for us but we have also been good for Nicolas and now he's got a great chance of going to the World Cup.\" Anelka played down speculation that his ambitions lay elsewhere. \"When I arrived on loan I said after two weeks that I would be happy to sign for the club, and that remains the case,\" he said. \"I am revelling in my selection [for France] and I think that all comes from the work I have done with Liverpool. \"I feel happy there and I have noticed that I have improved a lot since my arrival in England. I am in good shape, and we are still in contention for the title. Liverpool have a great team.\" PSG, who are 90% owned by the French media organisation Canal Plus, have \u00a340m debts and need to recoup as much as possible of the \u00a323m they paid Real Madrid for the striker. Anelka's spell on Merseyside has not been entirely convincing. He has scored only two goals in 19 league starts for Liverpool, though he has returned to the French squad and played against Russia last week. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
