In an extraordinary row that highlights the tensions being wrought within the EU\u2019s institutions by the health crisis, the board of the European Research council issued a damning statement about the man they chose to lead them three months ago. The ERC\u2019s scientific council said Mauro Ferrari resigned on Tuesday evening and made his damaging claims after being told to leave by the 19-strong board on Friday. The council went on to say that the Italian scientist had not engaged sufficiently with his job, spent too much time in America where he had a laboratory, and had gone over the heads of the ERC board to talk to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The ERC is the EU\u2019s chief funder of scientists seeking breakthroughs at the very frontiers of knowledge. Since its establishment in 2007, it has helped seven researchers win Nobel prizes. Ferrari, one of the world\u2019s leading nanoscientists, was three months into a four-year tenure but had been given permission to carry on with his research in the US on cancer treatments, as in line with previous arrangements with the organisation\u2019s presidents. Ferrari, who revealed in January in the Guardian he had retrained at the age of 43 to become a doctor and then a medical researcher after his first wife died from cancer, said he had joined the ERC believing he could help the funding agency serve \u201cthe needs of the world\u201d. But in his resignation announcement on Tuesday night, Ferrari had said he had become \u201cdeeply disappointed and disturbed\u201d by the EU\u2019s reaction to what he described as a \u201ca tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions\u201d. \u201cIn time of emergencies people, and institutions, revert to their deepest nature and reveal their true character,\u201d Ferrari wrote. Ferrari said his \u201cidealistic motivations were crushed by a very different reality\u201d. A proposal he had made in early March in Brussels to establish a special programme directed at combating Covid-19 was \u201cunanimously rejected\u201d by the ERC\u2019s governing body, he wrote. Later attempts to fund the best scientists following discussions with Von der Leyen herself had also \u201cdisintegrated upon impact\u201d with the layers of European commission bureaucracy, Ferrari said. \u201cI believed this [programme] justified by the expected burden of death, suffering, societal transformation, and economic devastation, especially striking the less fortunate, the weakest in the societies of the world,\u201d Ferrari wrote. \u201cI thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic.\u201d Ferrari said his proposal had been rejected on the grounds that the ERC\u2019s role was to fund from the \u201cbottom up\u201d rather than dictate the areas where scientists should focus. In response, the scientific council of the ERC claimed Ferrari had not understood his role and had \u201cdisplayed a lack of engagement with the ERC, failing to participate in many important meetings, spending extensive time in the USA and failing to defend the ERC\u2019s programme and mission when representing the ERC\u201d. \u201cIn contrast, Professor Ferrari made several personal initiatives within the commission, without consulting or tapping into the collective knowledge of the Scientific Council, and instead using his position to promote his own ideas\u201d, the ERC statement said. The ERC said Ferrari\u2019s proposal had been rejected as it was outside the remit of the agency and that \u201chis resignation in fact followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence\u201d. Ferrari said Von der Leyen had \u201cpersonally reached out asking for my input on how the pandemic might be addressed\u201d. But his contact with the commission president had \u201ccreated an internal political thunderstorm\u201d and his plans came to nothing, he added. Ferrari wrote that more broadly the EU had failed to live up to its ideals in dealing with coronavirus, with member states failing to offer aid to the countries most affected, including Italy, when it was needed most. In the latest development, finance ministers failed on Tuesday evening to come to agreement on how they would fund the rebuilding of the European economy, with the richer northern states resisting plans for new instruments that would make borrowing on the financial markets cheaper for the south and more expensive for them. Ferrari wrote that he had been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19 and that he \u201clost faith in the system itself\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
