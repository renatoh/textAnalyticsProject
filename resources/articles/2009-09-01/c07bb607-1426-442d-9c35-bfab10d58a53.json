And what show in the history of entertainment has not been improved by the introduction of a couple of rogue cops? Enter FIFA and UEFA, who have leapt on stage with the type of barnstorming law-enforcing which puts into perspective, and shames, the efforts of their \"cousins across the Pond\", the CIA and the FBI. To take the actions of the Zurich outfit first, even at its most subtle, \"The Company\" would struggle to match the Blatter Boys' instinctive feel for making the punishment fit the crime. Bend the transfer rules too far and they will snap back in your face. You play the game according to Blatter or you don't play at all. In short, don't dick with FIFA. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter (and at the FIFA/CIA level these are moot) this has indubitably added to the gaiety of the game. At a stroke, the predators are vulnerable. Whereas once they stalked the transfer jungle, offering silly money to anyone who took their fancy, now they must sit tight and tense throughout Christmas and January for fear that a rival will lure Nicolas Anelka away and leave them toothless. And it may not stop there. What if big beasts Manchester City, on a whim, decide to hoover up each and every left-footed player at the club? That would test Ancelotti's fabled diamond, perhaps to destruction. Thankfully, FIFA have never been the cracking\u2011open-a-beer-and-sitting-back-on-their-laurels type of guys and having nailed the Little Roman they are going after the Glazer Family. These, figuratively and literally, would be mighty scalps. Imagine the torment of Sir Alex Ferguson sitting through not one but two transfer windows with the Cristiano Ronaldo millions burning a hole in his pocket and no option but to absorb the pain. How red would be his face? A side effect of this perceptive policing will be that both Chelsea and United may find that, prevented from spending, their books are balanced. They will have served their debt to society and be starting with a clean slate, just as the hard nuts at UEFA introduce their financial fair play regulations. Not for the first time a FIFA punishment will turn out to be for the offender's own good. Meanwhile, Platini's mob in Geneva, in a footballing sense the spiritual descendants of J Edgar Hoover, have not been idle. At first glance, it may be hard to divine the wisdom in their handling of the Eduardo case but, as with so much of Platini's work, it takes time for its genius to sink in. But genius it is for the Frenchman has turned everything on its head. In future, should a player essay a dive and escape the referee's censure it will be in his best interests to get back on his feet and, rubbing his fake injury, turn himself in to the fourth official. Better, after all, an immediate yellow than a two-match ban down the line. Who shall police the divers? Why, the divers themselves. Hoover himself could not have devised a neater solution. What's more, defenders who, having clogged a dribbler, stand over him chiding him for diving will be doubly punished. First, a CCTV backed yellow card for the foul itself and then another for dissimulation. Dissembling is a two-way street \u2013 if diving is a sin then so is falsely accusing someone of being sinful. Little wonder UEFA's new motto is Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
