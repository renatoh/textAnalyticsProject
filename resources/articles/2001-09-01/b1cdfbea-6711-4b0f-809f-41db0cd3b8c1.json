Having spared the Reds' blushes at Anfield with a stunning equaliser against the Portuguese champions Boavista he immediately turned his attention to Dortmund, scene of Liverpool's Uefa Cup final triumph last season, but this time for a Group B tie with Borussia Dortmund. Despite seeing how good even fourth seeds in these groups can be, Owen remained confident. \"We played very well in away games in Europe last season and we don't fear anyone. We played and beat some of the best last season, teams like Roma and Barcelona, so we have nothing to be afraid of. \"We'd all like our form to be a little bit better than it is but every team has a dip in form and it's how you balance that with improvements that is the key.\" The Germans will no doubt view another run-in with Owen with some trepidation. So far this season he has scored a cracking goal to help batter Bayern Munich in the European Super Cup final in Monaco and followed up with a stunning hat-trick against Germany in the World Cup qualifier earlier this month. Owen said: \"We are on our way to what I believe will be the magical figure of 10 points that will see us qualify from this group.\" He has now scored on his debut in every club competition: the League Cup, FA Cup, Premiership, Uefa Cup and now Champions League. He said: \"It's nice to score on your debuts in different competitions and I have been fortunate enough to do that. I must admit I'd got to an age when I didn't think I'd have another debut. \"Getting into the Champions League has taken a long time coming and we intend to do well. We could have done a lot better against Boavista but there are a lot more games to be played for us to put things right. \"If it was a two-legged Uefa Cup game we would be a lot more disappointed than we are now. As it is we have another five games. Nobody has won a game in our group, so everyone is still level.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
