There are seven Christopher Walkens on stage. Two are women, one is Chinese and another Filipino. The latter is doing an impersonation of Colin Farrell doing an impersonation of Walken in Pulp Fiction. \"He had that fuckin' watch up his fuckin' ass for five fuckin' years!\" Welcome to All About Walken, a partly scripted, partly improvised, partly biographical comedy show from the mind of San Francisco standup Patrick O'Sullivan. \"Almost everyone I spoke to said a show about Christopher Walken wouldn't work, but I knew it would,\" says O'Sullivan. \"Here was a man doing big-budget movies, independent movies, music videos, Saturday Night Live - and standups were impersonating him. So all around there was this melding of Walken and pop culture. Not everyone knows his name, but they know his persona, from little kids who know what \"More cowbell!\" means, to 65-year-olds who admired him in The Deer Hunter. He floats across it all.\" Back on the sparsely decorated stage at Theatre 68 on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, the many Walkens (helped by uncanny takes on Jim Carrey, Woody Allen, Jennifer Tilly and Robert De Niro) re-enact scenes from The Dead Zone, Catch Me If You Can and True Romance, followed by the zombie dance from Thriller. Then, on the suggestion of an audience member, they improvise Walken in the Sex and the City movie. Two women dressed as Christopher Walken impersonating Carrie Bradshaw is surreal squared. The slow-talking cadence is unnerving, the word \"pussy\" bouncing off the walls as athletically as Walken himself does in the Fatboy Slim video Weapon of Choice. All About Walken started as a joke five years ago after O'Sullivan and his friends started impersonating each other at college. This morphed into them doing impersonations of each other doing famous people (including Walken). \"I've always thought outside of the box,\" says O'Sullivan. \"During college, I put on the first ever stage presentation of The Shawshank Redemption.\" Convinced he was on to something, O'Sullivan sat in his room for six months and immersed himself in the life and times of Walken. After putting together a cast, he persuaded a theatre on Hollywood Boulevard to put on the show in return for a cut of the ticket sales. That was in October 2006, and since then the buzz has been building. The show soon moves to San Francisco for a short run, with plans to take it to New York and maybe London. So has the man in question been to see this tongue-in-cheek homage? \"A couple of times it looked as if he was going to come, but it didn't work out,\" says O'Sullivan. \"But some of his family have, and also his agent, who thought it was fantastic. One time, one of the guys in the show was at the agent's office and had a speakerphone conversation with him ... as Christopher Walken. Walken told him he was very flattered.\" Of course, not everyone is as happy as the Oscar winner. With Walkenese being so contagious, there are some, admits O'Sullivan, who rue the day they bought the tickets. \"I've had many calls over the past two years that go something like this: 'Hi. I went to the show last week with my husband and now he will not stop impersonating Christopher Walken. I ask him to put the trash out and he answers as Walken. And I just want you to know that you're responsible for that.'\" O'Sullivan, however, hasn't let this put him off. He is already working on his next show, All About Jack - knowing full well that if there's anyone who is more fun to mimic than Walken, it's Jack Nicholson. www.myspace.com/allaboutwalken"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
