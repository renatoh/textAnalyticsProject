The meeting comes amid calls from Labor for the government to restore funding for Congress. The administrator, Alan Walker, said a meeting had been arranged in Canberra to discuss the current situation. \u201cSince 2008, the Congress has relied almost solely on funding from the federal government which has been directed at key programs to benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,\u201d Walker said. A first meeting of its creditors is scheduled to take place on Friday in Sydney. The opposition has called on the Morrison government to make a clear commitment about whether or not it intends to offer Congress a financial lifeline. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad news,\u201d Labor\u2019s spokesperson on Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, said. \u201cCongress is representative of many thousands of people. \u201cIf it is serious about taking a bipartisan approach to Indigenous affairs they will restore funding for Congress.\u201d In a statement, Wyatt would not commit to funding, saying that \u201cthe administration process enables an organisation to review its current financial and governance arrangements to provide a greater sense of certainty for the future. \u201cMy department will work with the administrator through this administration period. \u201cI will work with all Indigenous organisations on an outcomes basis to support self\u2011determination, empowerment and representation for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.\u201d Congress represents several thousand Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and people across the country. \u201cAfter years of struggle, National Congress is at a cross-road for continued survival,\u201d its chief executive, Gary Oliver, wrote to members in an email on Tuesday night. \u201cWe are optimistic about the appointment of the Hon Ken Wyatt as Minister for Indigenous Australians, but our financial need is urgent and compelling. Unless a very significant lifeline appears in the immediate future, I regret to say that the administration process will lead to the National Congress being wound up.\u201d National Congress was set up in 2010, and represents more than 180 Indigenous organisations and nearly 10,000 individual members. In 2013 the Abbott government withdrew its support and any commitment to future funding. Labor\u2019s spokesman on reconciliation and constitutional reform, Pat Dodson, says First Nations people will be able to see how serious this government is about co-design of a voice to parliament, by how it responds to congress\u2019s financial crisis. \u201cFirst Nations people should be wary of this government\u2019s commitment to a voice, if they are prepared to let Congress go under it calls into question their commitment to a voice to parliament, to a co-design process, to real reconciliation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe organisation has struggled financially since the beginning of 2014,\u201d Oliver wrote. \u201cNonetheless, due to contributions by the community and volunteers, National Congress has continued its advocacy on behalf of its members and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in general. \u201cNational Congress has continued to make submissions to government inquiries and until this month, it has remained active in the media and civil society to represent views supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests. \u201cFollowing the Don Dale scandal and the 2016 national election, National Congress managed to eke out survival by entering into a fee-for-service agreement with the then minister for Indigenous affairs, Nigel Scullion. \u201cHowever, this arrangement has compromised National Congress\u2019 ability to fulfil its mandate, especially in terms of engagement with its members across the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
