Goodwin is far from alone in his shameless greed; his mentality pervades most of the upper reaches of the private and increasingly now the public sector. Talk about \"rewards for failure\" is a fig leaf \u2013 such remuneration was never justified in any circumstances. The successes that these \"masters of the universe\" have been rewarding themselves for were entirely self-defined and in retrospect barely distinguishable from Madoff-style Ponzi schemes. The regulatory bodies and politicians went along with it all because so many of them were already benefiting from highly paid directorships or knew such rewards awaited them when they left the public sector. To see Gordon Brown and Alastair Darling pleading for Sir Fred to do the decent thing is laughable and demeaning. As past and present chancellor it really ought to occur to them that they set income tax bands and that this is the long-overdue moment to use that power. There seems to me no conceivable reason why anyone should receive an income beyond that of the prime minister, since no one could claim to have a more demanding or responsible job. Therefore a 100% tax band on income above say \u00a3250,000 would sort out Sir Fred and put an end to the worst excesses of the recent era. Julian Jones Bridport, Dorset One of the four arguments put forward by Jeremy Bentham in the early 1800s for occupational pensions was that it would ensure the \"fidelity\" of the employee because if they were \"tempted to malversation\" they would lose their future pension. While I'm not accusing the current raft of ex-banking executives of malversation, it may not just have been the \"bonus culture\" that led to City excesses but a \"pensions culture\" that provided a safety net for banking executives allowing them to escape, like latter-day Bruce Ismays, in their gold-plated lifeboats if they sank their organisations. Perhaps the likes of Sir Fred Goodwin would have behaved differently if they knew that some of their own entire pension would have been forfeited if they failed. Employers should take this into consideration when reviewing their executives' reward packages. Charles Cotton Reward adviser, Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development Why should Sir Fred give up his pension? As the home secretary would point out, he's followed the rules and he's legally entitled to it. If the government and the RBS board nodded it through, that's their problem, not his. Mind you, it doesn't say much for their governance. And Mr Prescott demands Sir Fred's pension be taken away \u2013 OK, John, can we apply the same rule to ex-ministers? Robert Ward Leeds Sir Fred says he will not reconsider the award despite presiding over the country's largest corporate loss. Faced with this refusal, is it not appropiate to strip Sir Fred of his title? A message needs to be sent by the government that they expect better from a man who has been honoured. At the least, if Sir Fred is to have his money he should be just called Fred. David Best Abergavenny, Gwent So the prime minister and chancellor want to set a principle that people who caused the financial crisis should lo se their pension. They should lead by example and renounce their pensions for their errors, which put the ex-RBS chief executive's into the shade. Julian Bird Northallerton, North Yorks hire Ministers order Sharon Shoesmith to be sacked without compensation or a pension and it's done. Ministers ask for Fred Goodwin to be removed from his post and he gets a pension beyond the dreams of avarice. So this is the more equal society Labour promised us? Lesley Cunneen Norwich Sir Fred Goodwin is clearly laughing all the way from the bank. Chris Webster Abergavenny, Gwent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
