In the worst scenes of their type witnessed in Scottish football for many years, riot police reinforcements were called in to control disturbances in the 17,846 crowd - sparked when a coin thrown from among the Rangers support struck Aberdeen striker Robbie Winters on the head. A group of around 20 fans from the Aberdeen section of Pittodrie's South Stand then raced on to the pitchside track to confront the Rangers fans. Some 4,000 had travelled from Glasgow. The fighting was broken up but match referee Mike McCurry took the teams off the pitch into the safety of the dressing rooms. A 17-minute delay followed before play resumed but the tension remained in what has been a tinderbox fixture in Scotland for many years. The animosity between the fans stems from a league match in 1988 when Rangers midfielder Ian Durrant sustained a career-threatening knee injury in a bad challenge from Aberdeen player Neil Simpson. Despite constant appeals for calm from both camps, the fixture has been soiled by several other incidents since then, among them Aberdeen fans failing to respect a minute's silence for legendary former Rangers and Scotland captain George Young and, most recently, Rangers defender Fernando Ricksen earning a four-match ban for a martial arts-style challenge on Aberdeen's Darren Young. Last night's game was given added spice by the return to Pittodrie of former Aberdeen hero Alex McLeish for the first time as manager of Rangers. Scottish football has long prided itself on the lack of crowd trouble at its grounds and last night's scenes, screened live on Sky Sports, have badly tarnished that hard-earned reputation. When play resumed the match was played in a strange, tense but subdued atmosphere. Winters was able to resume and he courageously walked direct to the edge of the pitch to take a corner. Rangers won the game through a Lorenzo Amoruso goal scored after the enforced dressing-room break. Both the SFA and SPL will be keen to prevent a new culture of violence among Scottish supporters and both Aberdeen and Rangers are likely to face heavy fines as a result of last night's incidents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
