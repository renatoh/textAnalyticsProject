The Bravery, Cut Copy and Whitey were among the more significant acts deft at synth rock. But it was Norfolk bohemian's White Rose Movement who had the best song with their debut, Love is a Number, in which singer Finn Vine's falsetto soared over histrionic, propulsive pop produced by Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, Futureheads). Though their opening salvo is never equalled on Kick, they come close with the blistering trash of Alsatian, Testcard Girl and the playful punk-disco of Girls in the Back. Though sometimes over-melodramatic WRM do have an edge that the likes of the Bravery lack proven by Deborah Carne - about the victim of a senseless attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
