Manpower said hiring intentions in Scotland were at a seven-year high despite the uncertainty being expressed in some quarters about independence. The employment group surveyed more than 2,000 firms and found that optimism on jobs was also growing in the public sector, which has been hit by spending cuts. James Hick, a director at Manpower, said county councils and health service organisations were employing more professional staff to develop new ways of delivering services. He said the retail sector was the biggest growth area, with supermarket chain Morrisons hiring thousands of staff to work in its new convenience stores. Internet retailers were also behind the rise in jobs, especially in the distribution sector, as they developed new ways to deliver goods to households and business customers. \"Internet providers are creating their own networks based around local hubs that rely on self employed drivers to make deliveries,\" said Hick. Hiring confidence in the public sector has risen more sharply than in private firms, said Manpower."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
