Hossein Derakhshan, 33, was reported by the Iranian website Jahan News to have confessed during initial interrogations to being involved in espionage. The Jahan News site, which is widely believed to be linked to the Iranian intelligence services, also said he had been described in Jewish newspaper articles as a \"friend of Israel\". Derakhshan is known in Iran as the Blogfather after effectively launching the country's craze for blogging. He has claimed 20,000 people a day read his postings. He holds joint Iranian-Canadian citizenship and left Tehran for Toronto in 2000 after hardline opponents of then president, Mohammad Khatami, closed down the reformist newspapers he worked on. He also lived in London for a while. Derakhshan had returned to Tehran three weeks ago. His blogs, in Persian and English, have been suspended. He used his Canadian passport to get into Israel in 2006 on a widely publicised trip to \"be a bridge between Iranian and Israeli people, who are manipulated by their own governments' and medias' dehumanising attitude, especially now that the possibility of some sort of violent clash is higher than ever\". Writing in the New York Times that year, he called the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a \"hardline reactionary\" running one of the \"most extreme governments post-revolutionary Iran has ever had\". However, Israeli commentators noted that he had recently begun to express anti-Israeli views in his postings, defending Iran's right to possess defensive nuclear weapons and expressing a degree of admiration for Ahmadinejad's stance against the US. Meir Javedanfar, a Middle East analyst, wrote on his website that attacks by Derakhshan on the former Iranian president Ayatollah Rafsanjani may have caused him to fall foul of internal power struggles in Iran. Derakhshan was aware that his trips to Israel could jeopardise his return to Iran. \"Iran doesn't recognise Israel, has no diplomatic relations with it \u2026 Too bad, but I don't care. Fortunately, I am a citizen of Canada and I have the right to visit any country I like,\" he wrote. \"I'm going to Israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
