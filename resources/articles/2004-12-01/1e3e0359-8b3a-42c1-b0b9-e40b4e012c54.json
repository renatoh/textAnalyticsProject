I've been on the Costa de la Luz for three days now, my longboard waxed and ready for action, but so far the only thing I've caught is a couple of tiddlers. Looking towards the glittering waters of Cape Trafalgar, the setting for Nelson's famous victory over the Franco-Spanish fleet in 1805, today looks to be just as disappointing. It's a gorgeous late-November morning on the Andalucian coast but the sea is as flat as the underside of a paella pan. I'm beginning to appreciate how the British admiral must have felt waiting for Napoleon's navy to flee C\u00e1diz. \"Patience,\" says Andy. \"The beauty of this part of the coast is that really powerful swells can come out of nowhere.\" A qualified surfing instructor and oceanographer, Andy should know what he's talking about. Through his travel company, Winterwaves, Andy specialises in five-day forecasts for British surfies, meaning that in theory you should be able to book your flight from the UK on a Monday and be practising cut backs on a 2m-high point break the following Saturday. The only problem is that when I booked my surfing holiday to Andalucia I hadn't heard of Andy or Winterwaves. It was my friend Jan, a German artist who lives in Vejer de la Frontera, a Moorish hilltop village 15 minutes from the coast, who told me about the spectacular surf on the Costa de la Luz. When conditions were right, he said, there was a wave off the point to the west of Barbate that broke for 200m. If I was prepared to wait until winter when the conditions were right, I should be able to ride it all the way into port. Well, the Cornish surfing season had already come and gone so I didn't mind delaying my trip until November. And when I showed my friend Charlie a picture of the view from Jan's apartment looking across Cape Trafalgar towards the Rif mountains in Morocco, he couldn't resist booking a ticket too. Thus it was that on a gloomy Friday evening in November, Charlie and I arrived at Stansted, our rucksacks bulging with wetsuits and Quiksilver thermals handily purchased from the concession at duty free. No sooner had we disembarked the plane at Jerez de la Frontera, however, than Jan had bad news for us. The low-pressure system we'd been hoping for over the Azores had stalled. Instead, the Costa de la Luz was enjoying a prolonged Indian summer. More in hope than expectation, we stuffed our boards into our hire car and headed for the beach. But when we reached Barbate the only sign of a wave was the wake of a passing fishing boat. No matter, if we couldn't surf Barbate we'd try somewhere else. The Costa de la Luz is almost continual beach from C\u00e1diz in the west to Tarifa in the east. And while Tarifa, because of its exposed position, is renowned for kite surfing, after Bolonia we'd been told the coast was less prone to the Levantine winds and the beach breaks became user-friendlier. Even if Barbate was a washout, Jan had assured us we'd be sure to find something surfable in El Palmar, a 2km stretch of sand directly to the west where the waves break from both right and left even at high tide. But when we got there, the only people out were a group of nine-year-olds. Eager to baptise my wetsuit, I grabbed my board and dived into the water. Half an hour later, I'd yet to catch a wave. \"Is your mate a beginner?\" one of the nine-year-olds asked Charlie cheekily. With no alternative but to cross our fingers and wait, we decided on a tour of the coast. Fortunately, this part of Andalucia is steeped in history and we found plenty to occupy us. We began with a climb to the lighthouse above Atlanterra, the former site of General Franco's summer house and now a luxury enclave for wealthy Sevilla\u00f1os. Then we hit C\u00e1diz with its cathedrals and the Torre Tavira from where the French admiral Villeneuve is said to have kept a nervous watch on the massing British fleet. Legend has it that it was also near C\u00e1diz - or Gadis at it was known to early Phoenician sailors - that Hercules performed his 10th labour, stealing the famous red-tinted cattle that still graze the coast from the monster Geryon. After the Greeks came the Romans, whose magnificent ruined city Baelo Claudia still commands views from Bolonia, and the Visigoths. Then, in the eighth century the Moors arrived and dubbed the region al-Andalus, stamping their own unique culture on the area by erecting mudejar-style palaces and minarets. We found one of the most beautiful examples of the latter in Vejer. Winding through the maze of cobbled alleyways behind the town's 13th-century castle walls, themselves part of the original Moorish alcazaba, we suddenly arrived at the parochial church with its minaret now crowned by a bell tower. Then, passing through the Arco de la Villa, one of five vaulted arches leading into the old town, we found ourselves in the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and El Jardin del Califa - a restaurant and hotel built on the ruins of the original Arab road from Barbate. After the Moors came the reconquista, but throughout the late 13th-century Vejer and nearby towns like Conil and Chiclana continued to switch from Spanish to Arab control, hence their suffix \"de la frontera\". Today, Conil and Barbate find themselves on another frontier - the trade in drugs and illegal immigrants from Morocco. Jan told us it was not uncommon to find bales of cannabis washed up on the beach and, on occasion, African stowaways, but thankfully the main industries were cattle farming and fishing. The region is famous for its beef or carne de retinto and, every April, when the tuna begin their annual migration from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, fleets set out from Zahara de los Atunes and other coastal towns trailing traditional almadraba fishing nets. It wasn't long before we had developed a taste for the local delicacies, too, in particular mojama - slivers of cured tuna washed down with a glass of fino - a taste that reminded us of the sea and made us even more determined to resume our quest for surf. On Sunday, we assayed Ca\u00f1os de Meca, a south-facing bay approached via a pine forest, and Cabo Trafalgar, another long stretch of sand famous both for its right-breaking waves near the point and its left-breaking waves along the beach. But once again we ended up at El Palmar whose consistency at mid to low tide was unrivalled. That day, Charlie caught a couple of one footers, but the next day he had to return to London. I, however, still had two days - plenty of time, I figured, for the surf to turn itself back on. \"If only you'd been here two weeks ago,\" said Andy when I ran into him on the beach the following day. \"The wind was light easterly and the tide was over two metres. Fantastic!\" It had been another disappointing morning and Andy had taken pity on me. With nothing better to do, I accompanied him to his home where he entertained me with pictures of his mates riding long right-handers at Barbate or describing perfect cut-backs at El Palmar at sunset. Andy explained that the best waves were generated by low-pressure systems spinning far out in the Atlantic. When the wind was blowing in the right direction, perfect corduroy lines of waves appeared seemingly from nowhere. \"Don't worry, the surf's building up nicely. Tomorrow, you'll see what I mean.\" Not expecting much, I awoke early the following morning and wound down the hill from Vejer for a final look at the beach. It was my last day and I was determined to catch a big one, but in the distance the Gulf of C\u00e1diz looked glassy and serene. It wasn't until I was almost upon the beach that I realised there'd been a change. The tide had just begun to turn but already the dunes were bumper-to-bumper with camper vans. Looking to where the nine-year-olds had taunted me three days before, I was gratified to see eight surfers in the line up and long corduroy lines breaking to the right and left just as Andy had predicted. Pulling on my wetsuit, I paddled out and within minutes was riding the first in a series of long beach breaks. The waves were about a metre high and broke roughly every 10 seconds, carrying me all the way to the shore. It wasn't perfect, but after the previous days' experience I wasn't complaining. My only regret was that Charlie wasn't there to share it with me. The best surf spots on the Gulf of C\u00e1diz Barbate: Sheltered town beach protected by harbour wall. Good option when winds are strong and everywhere else is blown out. Yerba Buena: West-facing beach just beyond Barbate with 200m right-breaking wave off point. Generally needs 2m of swell. N/NE winds are best. Experienced surfers only. Ca\u00f1os de Meca: South-facing bay approached via pine forest on road from Vejer de la Frontera. Right-breaking wave from point and left-breaking reef breaks. Works on NW winds. Low tide. Experienced surfers only. El Palmar: West-facing beach with waves from both right and left. Best at mid-to-low tide when waves can reach heights of up to 3m (but is best on 1-2m swells). Conil: Good town beach but only works on a pushing and dropping tide. Cabo Roche: Protection from Strong E winds. Very fast hollow waves that have a tendency to snap boards with no mercy. La Barossa: Extensive beach breaks working on same conditions as El Palmar.
