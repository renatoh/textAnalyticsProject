Cancelled concerts include those in London this week, as well as all others until the one planned for 5 June in Switzerland.

Our way of life has once again been threatened but we will overcome this together. Thank you.\u201d Grande returned to her home town of Boca Raton in Florida on Tuesday. Grande had left the stage after performing at the Manchester Arena when the bomb exploded as fans were leaving the sold-out venue, which has a 21,000-person capacity. At least 22 people were killed and 59 injured, with many more walking wounded. While the O2 said an announcement would be made as soon as it had clear information, many concluded from Grande\u2019s return home that the tour was off. Hours after the attack, she tweeted: \u201cBroken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don\u2019t have words.\u201d Musicians have continued to pay tribute to Grande and her fans. During a performance on the US season finale of The Voice on Tuesday night, Miley Cyrus dedicated her song to Grande and \u201ceveryone who experienced that horrific attack\u201d. \u201cOur hearts are with you,\u201d she said. In a statement on Monday, Grande\u2019s manager, Scooter Braun, said: \u201cTonight our hearts are broken. Words cannot express our sorrow for the victims and families harmed in this senseless attack. \u201cWe mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act. We are thankful for the selfless service tonight of Manchester\u2019s first responders who rushed towards danger to help save lives. \u201cWe ask all of you to hold the victims, their families, and all those affected in your hearts and prayers.\u201d Take That, who were playing a show at the Liverpool Echo Arena when the attack happened, cancelled the following night\u2019s show in the city and postponed the dates they were due to play in Manchester on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Blondie cancelled a concert in London on Tuesday \u201cas a mark of respect for the victims of the terrible attack\u201d. But other gigs went ahead as planned. Simple Minds played at Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, telling fans: \u201cWe would have felt cowardly just leaving town, especially Manchester, a place that has been great to us since the early days.\u201d Grande\u2019s brother, Frankie Grande, is due to perform in Bush Hall in west London on Saturday night, and the venue believes the event will go ahead. Nicki Minaj, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Harry Styles, Lorde, Justin Timberlake and Rihanna were among the other celebrities and pop stars who reacted to the attack. Social media users have been sharing an image of bunny ears \u2013 often worn by Grande \u2013 in solidarity for the victims. The British entertainer James Corden paid an emotional tribute to Manchester on CBS\u2019s The Late Late Show on Monday night. \u201cMany of you won\u2019t have ever been to Manchester but you will definitely have heard of it. It\u2019s famous all over the world for so many wonderful things,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat football teams: Man City; Man United. Incredible music: Oasis and Joy Division. It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes; it\u2019s the home of the inventor of the first computer. It\u2019s a place full of comedy and curries and character. \u201cBut when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I\u2019m telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard-pressed to find. \u201cStrong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
