You started working for us only six months ago and already our 18-month-old son is devoted. Each morning when your key turns in the door, he peels himself out of my arms and runs to you. \"Lellie, Lellie.\" He can nearly say your name now, his first real word after \"mama\". You laugh as he strokes your hair and entwines his fingers around the red beads on your necklace. I smile encouragingly as I go upstairs to get ready for work. But did either of you actually notice when I left the room? \"Isn't your nanny wonderful,\" other mothers say. \"Yes, such a find,\" I reply. \"I couldn't work full-time without her.\" Partly true. You adore being with him, you never phone your friends or turn up late. You're almost too committed, and somehow that's what irks me. But how could I admit that to my friends, or to my husband? Instead, I must appear intensely grateful that my son seems to prefer another woman to myself. \"He'll always know you're the mother,\" I tell myself when I see his face turn red with fury when you leave. Am I imagining it, or was that a slight smile of satisfaction on your face? I know a nanny has to get some payback, and it's no bad thing he's learning to form loving attachments beyond his mum and dad. So would I be the most selfish mother in the world to employ a nanny he loved a little less? I'm very tempted, but for now I'll settle for being second best. \u2022 Tell us what you're really thinking.
