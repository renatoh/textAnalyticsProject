These characters were forever clashing with management, endlessly threatening to down tools and head for the picket line. The show's catchphrase, delivered by Miriam Karlin's shop steward, was \"Everybody out!\" Coincidentally, it is the same battle cry employed by Rita O'Grady (Sally Hawkins), the firebrand hero of Made in Dagenham, which premiered in London last night, suggesting that this fact-based film is informed as much by comedies about trade union disputes as by the disputes themselves. And so it proves. The film pays loving tribute to the striking machinists at Ford's motor plant via the vehicle of the bawdily unreconstructed class-war farce, referencing everything from The Rag Trade to the Boulting brothers' I'm All Right, Jack to Carry On at Your Convenience. At one stage, when the factory gets too hot, the girls strip down to their undies. This in turn prompts the union rep (Bob Hoskins) to dab his brow, avert his eyes and murmur \"Oh my gawd\", as though he's just spotted Barbara Windsor sunbathing nude on the roof of the nurses' station. Happily, the route leads us somewhere rather different. Rita (an amalgam of several real-life protesters) is a cash-strapped seamstress, adrift in a late-60s era of rayon, crimplene and rampant male chauvinism. Outraged when she and her fellow workers are dismissed as unskilled labour, she sparks a mass walk-out that electrifies the media and exposes the cosy relations between an intractable management (embodied by Rupert Graves) and the blustering union officials (represented by Kenneth Cranham). There is dissent in the ranks and problems blooming at home and yet our pint-sized Guevara will not be deterred. Her journey of empowerment leads her all the way from the council estates of outer London to a pow-wow with secretary of state Barbara Castle (played with lip-smacking relish by Miranda Richardson). Made in Dagenham is directed by Nigel (Calendar Girls) Cole from a script by Billy Ivory, who cut his teeth writing episodes of Minder. It's uncomplicated fare, overly spiced with 60s cliches, right down to the louche fashion photographer who lies on his back to snap his pics. But the film is also robust, amiable and so warm-hearted you'd be a churl to take against it. Hawkins gives a winning performance as the working-class sparrow who grows slowly in stature. Rosamund Pike is superb as the tragic trophy wife who finds her Cambridge history degree is the perfect qualification for her new career passing the cheese-board around at dinner parties. Together, these women form the heart and soul of Made in Dagenham. They ensure that this comedy is travelling forward, not back. The 1968 Ford motor strike lasted three weeks and laid the ground for the Equal Pay Act of 1970. That's because revolutionaries, as Cole's film reminds us, come in all shapes and sizes. Some are gilded poster-boys, some are Marxist militants, and some are lowly seamstresses, supposed sitcom fodder, hunched over their Singer sewing machines,expecting an honest day's wage for an honest day's work. They stand their ground and get the job done. With the occasional tea break thrown in for good measure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
