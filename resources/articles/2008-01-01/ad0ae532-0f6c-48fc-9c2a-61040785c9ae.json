It emerged yesterday that EMI, under its new venture capitalist owners, has tabled an indicative bid for the publisher, whose catalogue goes back to the 1960s and includes Jethro Tull, Blondie, David Bowie and more recently Gnarls Barkley and Blur front man Damon Albarn. Terra Firma-owned EMI, where new boss Guy Hands is shaking up the struggling recording arm with thousands of job cuts, will face competition for Chrysalis from Warner Chappell, the music publishing unit of Warner Music. It is also thought that Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a joint venture between Sony and trusts set up by Michael Jackson, could be interested. The publisher is headed by Martin Bandier, the former boss of EMI's music publishing business. Chrysalis has also seen interest from private equity groups, attracted by its dependable cash flows. Earlier this week it confirmed it was still \"in negotiations with a number of interested parties\". The City predicts the business could fetch between \u00a3160m and \u00a3190m. Patrick Yau, a media analyst at Ingenious Securities, said a realistic value would be 210p to 260p a share. \"Ultimately, we expect that the music trade buyers will have the greatest interest and most flexibility on price, as they will be able to achieve a higher level of cost-saving than the private equity players,\" he said. EMI, Terra Firma, Chrysalis, Warner and Sony/ATV all declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
