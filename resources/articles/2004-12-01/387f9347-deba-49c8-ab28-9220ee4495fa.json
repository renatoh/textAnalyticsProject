The Liberal government had hoped the court would require it, rather than give it the option to allow gay marriage, making it easier to push draft legislation through parliament. Instead, the court declared only that the government had the authority to legislate on gay marriage and that its proposed definition of marriage as \"the lawful union of two persons\" would not violate the constitution. The court also said that the constitution protected the right of religious officials to refuse to perform homosexual marriages. The gay marriage question is a political hot potato that has divided all four parties in parliament, and intense campaigns are planned on both sides for MPs' votes. The legislation seems likely to make it on to the statute, particularly since the prime minister, Paul Martin, has decided to require all his cabinet members to support it. Canada's lower courts had already made gay marriage legal in six of the country's ten provinces and one of its three northern territories, but it remains illegal in the rest of the country. The supreme court's ruling was a rebuke for opponents of gay marriage. They had argued that a redefinition would violate the country's 1867 constitution, which referred to marriage at a time when it was assumed to be exclusively heterosexual. \"Canada is a pluralistic society,\" the court said. \"Our constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life.\" Meanwhile, New Zealand's parliament also narrowly approved a bill that recognises civil unions between unmarried couples both straight and gay today, though the law falls short of legalising gay marriage. Cheering and clapping broke out in the normally staid chamber when the speaker of house announced that the 120-member body had voted 65-55 in favour of the bill, and outside the parliamentary building, several hundred people rallied in support of the legislation. The new law, which takes effect from May 1 2005, gives unmarried couples the same rights as married ones, including in the areas of child custody, property rights, tax, welfare and retirement benefits. The bill also allows civil union partners to be buried in the same plot of land, something that is banned under current law. \"Civil union offers an alternative to those [couples] unable to marry or who prefer not to marry,\" New Zealand's associate justice minister David Benson-Pope said during the final stage of the debate. Supporters of the bill have stressed the new law would not permit same-sex marriages, and Mr Benson-Pope insisted that it \"does not change or undermine marriage, or pose any danger to the family.\" Conservatives have dubbed the legislation the \"gay marriage law\" and said it would degrade the meaning of marriage. They claimed the bill was the first step toward recognising same-sex marriages. New Zealand First MP Dail Jones said during today's debate that marriage \"can only be the relationship of a man and a woman with the view to having children.\" Mr Benson-Pope, however, predicted that opposition to the bill would \"quietly evaporate\" now that it was passed and time would show that \"the sky doesn't fall in\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
