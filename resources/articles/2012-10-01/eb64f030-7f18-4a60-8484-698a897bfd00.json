The 100 shoppers queuing around the block to get into the shop are also a good sign for middle Britain's favourite department store, which has just opened in the well-heeled university city. With crowds more common at closing down sales these days, the bustle is a refreshing sight. Local businesses anticipate a \"John Lewis effect\" that will draw shoppers from across the county. \"This will attract more business to Exeter,\" says Pete Emmanuel, a trader who runs one of the adjacent market stalls. Emmanuel is surprisingly upbeat given the competitive threat posed by a retailer which measures its turnover in billions. \"We have our own clientele and sell things other people don't,\" he says; his stall currently has a monopoly on medical support stockings. The compact five-storey John Lewis, at what one person described as the \"grotty\" end of the high street, is a departure from the company's usual sprawling interiors. Like other major chains before the recession, John Lewis relied on new malls and regeneration projects to provide new outlets. But with property investors taking a dim view of our future spending power, many schemes have been mothballed or dropped. At half the usual size, the \"flexible\" format means opening in smaller shopping centres makes financial sense. \"We can now consider opening shops in areas that were not always thought feasible for a traditional John Lewis building,\" says Street. He sees \"at least 10\" locations, including York and Chelmsford, where such stores could work. Despite the rearguard action being fought by government high street tsar Mary Portas, town centres around the country are being pushed to breaking point as retail chains are felled by the recession. One in seven high-street shops lies empty, with the recent failure of JJB Sports, which resulted in more than 130 closures, making a grim picture worse. Against that backdrop, the strength of Exeter's retail centre \u2013 albeit with more chain stores than the national average \u2013 is a good example of what can be achieved when councils and developers work together. Local news reports hailed the arrival of John Lewis as one of the most significant events in the city's economic history. Property giant Land Securities was behind the \u00a3225m redevelopment of Exeter's Princesshay shopping precinct as well as the multimillion-pound refurbishment of the building John Lewis now occupies. \"It's about appropriate scale,\" says its development director Nick Davis. \"We didn't flood Exeter with 100 new shops. The city already has a low level of retail voids and the arrival of John Lewis will widen the catchment and strengthen Exeter not only as a place to shop but also to invest.\" John Lewis is defying the economic trend with sales up 12% in the year to date. Analysts are divided on whether the banking crisis has turned Britons on to the charms of the retailer's employee-ownership scheme or if it has thrived because its customers tend to come from higher socio-economic brackets. There are rails devoted to outdoor brands Barbour and Hunter, as well as items from local designer Alice Temperley, while shelving racks of designer coffee machines and towels are straight out of the pages of a lifestyle magazine. But with UK retail sales growth expected to be minimal this year, Exeter's gain could be at the expense of nearby centres such as Exmouth and Newton Abbot, says Matthew Hopkinson of retail research firm Local Data Company: \"It's like a ship listing sending the tin rolling from one side to the other.\" The success of the large indoor shopping complex, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre or the Westfield malls in London, suggests consumers want big modern stores even if they bemoan the disappearance of their high street. Retailers now need just 120 stores to cover the UK compared with 500 in the 80s and 90s. Despite being a national chain John Lewis has just 38 stores, supplemented by a huge online operation. Hopkinson says the task of shoring up Britain's high streets against structural change brings to mind the business maxim \"how do you eat an elephant?\". \"The answer is you cut it into small pieces first. What we're dealing with is people having to eat an elephant; they have to manage decline to a point they can regenerate from.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
