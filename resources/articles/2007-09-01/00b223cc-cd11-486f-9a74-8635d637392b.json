But the Russia coach talked with a fearlessness which was echoed by his players as he looked ahead to Wednesday's qualifier at the revamped stadium. Russia's 3-0 win at home to Macedonia on Saturday kept them a point ahead of England and brought their impressive defensive record to one goal conceded in eight qualifiers. Hiddink spoke after of his respect for England but emphasised there was no trepidation among his squad. \"England were obviously stronger than Israel,\" said the Dutchman, whose team were held 1-1 by Israel in Moscow last year. \"Israel didn't have a single chance. And of course when you think of the friendly match between England and Germany [last month] you're impressed by the power of the English. But that doesn't frighten us. In any case the game starts at 0-0 and I hope the numbers on the board at the end will bring joy to us alone.\" That seems far from inconceivable to his upbeat side, buoyed by victory against Macedonia. \"We're attacking, scoring goals and we can look forward with optimism to the match with England,\" said the Lokomotiv Moscow midfielder Diniyar Bilyaletdinov. The striker Dmitri Sychev acknowledged that England would present a far tougher test than Macedonia but said Russia, unlike Israel, would set out to win at Wembley. \"The main thing is that we take the game to them,\" he said. \"If we play our football we'll get a good result.\" Hiddink does not intend to abandon his attacking style for the occasion. \"We're not going there just to defend. If we sit back for 90 minutes, sooner or later they'll punish us,\" the coach said. \"We'll have to attack but we will have to defend as well. I see it as a high-tempo game with both sides looking to score.\" Russia created plenty of chances at home to Macedonia after going ahead early through Vasili Berezutski but wastefulness brought a scare midway through the second half. The goalkeeper Vladimir Gabulov was sent off in conceding a penalty and his replacement, Vyacheslav Malafeev, saved the spot-kick. Goals in the last six minutes from Andrei Arshavin and the Sevilla striker Aleksandr Kerzhakov completed the win. Malafeev, Russia's third-choice keeper, will start against England and there are fitness doubts about the striker Ivan Saenko and winger Yuri Zhirkov but some in Russia feel England are vulnerable. \"They lack organisation, the firm hand of the coach which was there under [Sven-Goran] Eriksson is not in evidence,\" said the former Russia midfielder Sergei Semak. \"England should be producing much better results.\" The history England v Hiddink June 1996 England 4 Holland 1 Euro 96 finals, at Wembley May 2002 South Korea 1 England 1 Friendly, in Seoqwipo England v Russia (USSR/CIS) May 1958 USSR 1 England 1 Friendly, in Moscow June 1958 England 2 USSR 2 World Cup finals, group stage, in Gothenburg June 1958 England 0 USSR 1 World Cup group play-off, in Gothenburg Oct 1958 England 5 USSR 0 Friendly, at Wembley Dec 1967 England 2 USSR 2 Friendly, at Wembley June 1968 England 2 USSR 0 European Ch'ship, in Rome June 1973 USSR 1 England 2 Friendly, in Moscow June 1984 England 0 USSR 2 Friendly, at Wembley Mar 1986 USSR 0 England 1 Friendly, at Tblisi June 1988 England 1 USSR 3 European Ch'ship, in Frankfurt May 1991 England 3 USSR 1 Friendly, at Wembley April 1992 CIS 2 England 2 Friendly, in Moscow P12 W5 D4 L3 For 21 Against 15"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
