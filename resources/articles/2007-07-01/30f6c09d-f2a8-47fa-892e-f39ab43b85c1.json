To take 19 wickets against a quality side like India and then be denied by the weather was massively frustrating but there is a precedent and it is one we're hoping to put to good use in the week ahead. In the 2005 Ashes series we lost a lot of overs to rain against Australia at Old Trafford and they ended up hanging on for a draw with Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath at the crease. But we then went on to beat them at Trent Bridge, the venue for Friday's second Test, and we need to do the same thing. Michael Vaughan famously got us into a huddle at the end of that Ashes Test in Manchester and he said all the right things once more on Monday evening after we realised that the rain had robbed us again. He reminded us that we'd played good cricket and that we have to keep our standards up at Trent Bridge. A result like this makes you even more determined to set the record straight but, if we can perform to that level again in Nottingham, we'll be fine. It's just a shame we weren't able to finish things off. I was fielding at short-leg when Monty Panesar went up for that leg-before shout against Sreesanth and I must admit I thought it was out. I know you don't have the best angle from that position but you're so close to the bat that you have a gut instinct - and mine was that Steve Bucknor was about to raise his finger and make it 1-0 to England. It looked very close and, with the information you now get from Sky, with Hawk-Eye and so on, you realise that a lot of deliveries that wouldn't once have been given out are actually out. You've really got to play with the bat these days against spinners. This isn't to criticise Bucknor at all, because we all know umpires have it tough. It's more our disappointment than anything. One or two people have suggested that we didn't bowl our overs quickly enough on Monday but, as our coach, Peter Moores, has said, you can't start rushing around like headless chickens against a high-class team like India. Obviously we were trying to get in as many overs as we could and there are times of course when you're trying to be streetwise. But, when the other side is being streetwise as well, it's tricky. It's fair to say India were taking as much time as possible for their batsmen to get to the crease. We were trying to quicken things up, they were trying to slow them down. That's international sport and we have no complaints. But to say we didn't show enough urgency is just wrong. You have to strike the balance between giving enough thought to dismiss Test batsmen and beating the rain. There's nothing I can think of that we should have done differently. We did our best to play positive cricket throughout, including scoring quick runs in our second innings. And in any case we were probably lucky to get as much play as we did. We thought it might rain sooner, which in a way makes the result harder to deal with. Five down would have been bearable. Nine down is slightly more difficult to take. The great thing is that we've got a lot to build on. That was probably our best bowling performance as a unit since we beat Australia. There have been moments over the past couple of years when Harmy and Monty have bowled in tandem, and a few great performances from Hoggy. But for everyone to bowl so well for the whole game, it was just exceptional. We are moving forward and it was nice to look around and see several of the guys I had played Under-19 cricket with. The next Ashes are in 2009 and that performance bodes well. Trent Bridge has been a good ground for us in the past and we have some good memories from beating Australia there two years ago. We've played well once against a side of India's calibre and the feeling in the dressing room is that we can do it again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
