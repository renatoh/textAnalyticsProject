Every celebrity who has visited Stockholm has stayed here, and the views from the rooms and the breakfast veranda are splendid. Our room was sumptuous, the service was faultless, and our bed... our bed. It was very wide, and hard, and just about the best bed we'd ever slept in. One word of advice: don't go minibar mad. See the men in the white spats Buckingham Palace is guarded by seasoned warriors with bearskins on their heads who won't look at you even if you tickle them. The Royal Palace, Stockholm, is guarded by teenagers, one presumes on national service, in comedy white spats and white gloves, who goggle at every young thing who passes. There are no fences around the palace, perhaps because the Swedish royals no longer live there, and you can march along behind the white-spatted soldiers, should you choose to, as they stamp around shouting at each other and changing the guard. Visit Skansen Stockholm sprawls grandly upon a magnificent archipelago of rocky, forested islands; the city is crisscrossed with glittering corridors of sea. On one of the inner-city islands is a large open-air museum called Skansen. The adverts describe it as \"the highpoint of Stockholm\", and they do not lie. Old buildings - some 100 years old, some 700 years old, some posh, some very humble - have been brought here, complete with contents, from all over Sweden. Many are roofed with green turf and weeds and sunflowers. Somehow, it's all magic. Aside from the beautiful buildings, working craftshops, farmyards and hill-top setting, there is a zoo. Residents include a family of brown bears, a pair of wolves, lynxes, reindeer, moose, and sheep from Gotland (the ones with the brilliantly crinkly coats). They all live in large, leafy, splashy compounds that put London Zoo et al to shame. I defy you not to love it. On the Sunday that we were there, Skansen was hosting an oldie-worldie style Swedish fair, with people dressed up in oldie-worldie outfits, roasting apples, tables groaning with mashed potato and hot fish, pens of big fat pigs, and random days-of-yore funfair games. Not big, not clever, but probably worth the airfare alone. Go mushrooming The island that plays host to Skansen is mostly parkland, and you can explore it in about two hours. On the way, at certain times of year, you will pass lots of mushrooms and lots of people with their bottoms in the air, small baskets of fungi beside them. \"You have no mushrooming culture, you English,\" one woman told us, when we stopped to admire her crop. She, as it turned out, was Danish, but apparently mushrooming culture is strong right across Scandinavia, and Britain's staggering lack of mushrooming culture is the subject of widespread derision. \"Button mushrooms!\" spat the woman, before shuffling off. Practise your Swedish When the Vikings came to Britain, they brought more than their gene pool with them: they also presented us with a hefty wedge of language. To your average linguistically-challenged Brit, this makes listening to Swedish a curious experience: many of their words are the same as ours and even sound as though they're being pronounced in an English accent. You can almost - but not quite - understand the odd sentence. Hello in Swedish is \"hey\" (pronounced as in the English \"hey, baby\"), doctor is \"doktor\" (pronounced as in the English \"doctor\"); and so on. Spooky. But you'll have to try hard if you want to really work on your Swedish: fluent English is spoken widely in Stockholm. Go shopping Usually, I hate shopping, but I loved it in Stockholm. In the new parts of town, there are street markets full of chanterelle mushrooms and cloudberries. In the old city, behind the Royal Palace, there are little boutiques full of pottery, sheepskin caps, soft wool ponchos and all manner of items you didn't know you couldn't live without. Go on a boat The Stockholm archipelago has 24,000 islands, and there are dozens of different ferry and guided boat trips that you can take right from the heart of the city. All you need to do is pitch up on the waterfront and buy a ticket. Hang out in the bar at the Grand This is a good place to sit and drink alcohol, and watch the sunlight dancing across the roofs of the old city - and it is open to non-residents, too. In fact, the staff are not at all sniffy about scruffy English people roughing up their lovely velvet seats, just so long as they are prepared to shell out an arm and a leg (not including VAT and service) for one small glass of wine. Avoid the fish There's a big pickled fish thing going on in Stockholm, and the bottom line on that is that it's wrong and gross. Back slowly away from the breakfast table, with your hands in the air, and find a nice croissant to eat instead. Life's too short for cold herring. Alternatively, try some delicious Swedish cheese.
