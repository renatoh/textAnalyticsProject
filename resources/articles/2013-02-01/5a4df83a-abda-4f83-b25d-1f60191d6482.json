It flew about a foot behind Simon Zebo, and given that he was in full flow, the Irish wing did not have time to think when he saw how wide of the mark the pass was. Impetuous instinct took over. Zebo kicked his left leg up a little in his backstride and, well, you've probably seen it by now. If you haven't, no doubt you will do soon in the run-up to Ireland's match against England in Dublin on Sunday, or in any other number of Six Nations highlights in the weeks and years ahead. Without checking his stride he knocked the ball with his heel, leaned back and tapped it up again with his outstretched left hand, then turned, gathered it in with the tips of his fingers, and with that one little flick, things changed. Lynda and Arthur Zebo are now so sick of the media attention their boy has been given since that moment of sporting magic that they do not talk to the press anymore. \"I'm so sorry,\" Lynda says. \"It has been totally overwhelming for all of us.\" Zebo's mother told the Irish Independent that the only word for it was \"mania\". Simon Zebo does not seem quite so put-out by all the attention. That night, after Ireland's eight-point win over Wales, he was playing DJ at Havana Browns nightclub, dancing while he dropped a Kanye and Jay-Z tune on a crowd of 100 or so happy revellers, the tipsier ones lurching over the decks to shout their congratulations for the try he scored. Somebody filmed a snippet of it, and the footage popped up on the websites of a few of the Irish tabloids. \"Zeebs?\" says the veteran Ireland centre Brian O'Driscoll, with a knowing grin, \"he is one of a kind\". The match against England will be Zebo's fifth for Ireland. His debut for came last summer, against the All Blacks. At the start of that season he had played six games for Munster, but he finished it as their leading try-scorer, with 12 in 19 starts, including three in a Heineken Cup match against Northampton. That made them sit up. Two days later Zebo was whistled up to join the Irish Wolfhounds when Luke Fitzgerald dropped out injured, and he duly sliced through the England Saxons to score a try in the final seconds of the match. So far, so flash. Zebo is far from the first fleet-footed kid who caught short a defence or two in his first full season, before the opposition have heard who he is or had a chance to analyse his style. If you want to know what makes him a little different to some of the others, you need to flick ahead a few months to the autumn internationals, and Ireland's match against South Africa. Rob Kearney was out injured, and, on the strength of what he had seen in training, the head coach, Declan Kidney, decided to stick Zebo in at full-back. It was the first time he had played there in his professional career. Against the Boks this was a tough ask. They love nothing so much as bombarding the full-back. Two weeks later England picked two full-backs to play against them, Alex Goode and Mike Brown on the wing and here Ireland were with none. They lost, 16-12,They lost, 16-12, but Zebo was outstanding, taking his catches, making his tackles, and doing his damndest to break the gainline. \"I always thought I could play 15,\" he said afterwards. \"I'd just never really had the chance till that autumn series. So, yeah, I've no issues whatsoever. I'll play there again if I'm asked to.\" Three weeks later he was, against Argentina, and again he scored a try. \"That's the key thing about Simon,\" says Ian Costello, the skills coach at Munster. \"He is not just a speed merchant. He has fantastic evasion skills, good balance, good instincts about when to support and what support lines to run, sometimes he pushes himself into first receiver, so he is quite happy to be a playmaker, then defensively he has an excellent kicking game and an excellent fielding game. \"He's not a one-trick pony. He is top-class in four or five areas, and you can't negate them all. If people close him down in one area, it just leaves him room to exploit another.\" It was not always that way. On the field Zebo plays with his socks round his ankles, but off it he has pulled them up in the past couple of years. As a kid he was too talented to settle on one hobby alone, playing football for Avondale, hurling for Blackrock, and Gaelic football for his school, Presentation Brothers in Cork. The two things he possessed were speed and daring. \"I'd love to tell you I saw all this coming,\" says his first rugby coach at Cork Constitution, John O'Mahoney. \"But that would be stretching things. That audacity he showed though, against Wales, it's very much in character with the man I know. I first met him when he was eight, and he stood out for two things: he was a lovely kid, and he was quick.\" That's his inheritance from his father. Arthur Zebo, born and raised in Martinique, was an 800m runner. He qualified for France at the 1976 Olympics but broke his leg while on national service so never got the chance to run alongside Steve Ovett and the eventual champion, Alberto Juantorena. While in Paris he met his future wife, Lynda, and moved back to Cork with her. Simon's sister, Jesika, was a talented 400m runner, competing at the European Indoor Championships. Simon was clocked at 11.10sec for the 100m when at school, and his times over 40m are the fastest that have been seen in the Irish team, speedier than those of Craig Gilroy, the other quicksilver young player Declan Kidney has selected on the other wing. \"It was 9.4 metres per second,\" Zebo explained. \"But I was carrying the ball. I'd have to do it without the ball and see how fast I can really go.\" The French connection almost caused Zebo to join Toulouse, who made him an offer this season. He speaks the language and has family in the region, but decided there was unfinished business in Munster. It would have been rough justice if the province had lost him, as Costello explains. \"He'd be the first to admit that for a while he didn't come close to realising it his talent. He needed to find his own way, and I don't think that really happened until he was around that 20. His coaches at Munster came down on him pretty hard to get him to realise the potential. And Simon bought into it. He has transformed himself in the last 18 months. \"We always knew that if we carve off a few rough edges we could have an unbelievable diamond. You could see it shining in him like a light.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
