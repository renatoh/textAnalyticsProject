Oram took the new ball in England's second innings at Lord's, having sent down 30 overs in the first, but incurred a side strain on the last day and aggravated the injury again in the nets yesterday. The allrounder's quota of overs will now have to come from elsewhere, with Kyle Mills primed for a Test debut at a ground which traditionally encourages swing and seam. Oram could yet play solely as a batsman, however - especially if Craig McMillan continues to experience pain from the finger he broke for a second time in a matter of weeks against Leicestershire over the weekend. McMillan will have an injection to ease the discomfort in the little finger of his left hand tomorrow before netting. \"We are giving those players as much time as possible without putting too much pressure on them and the rest of the squad who will be preparing to play,\" said coach John Bracewell. \"It is part and parcel of touring that people get injured. No decision is left solely to the player; in the end I will have to assess things and it will come down to his comfort after an injection. He wasn't that comfortable today. \"Jacob will be considered but not necessarily selected. His inability to bowl does complicate the balance but also might make us use bowlers who are more specific. \"We will leave all the calls on the injuries until after another practice but I am reasonably clear in my mind about the balance of the side.\" Mathew Sinclair, who scored a double century on his Test debut, has been plucked from league cricket with Cleethorpes and is on standby in case of further mishap. He will be released on Thursday morning if not required. New Zealand took the rare step of naming their first Test XI more than 48 hours before the start at Lord's and Bracewell suggests they may announce their side early again. \"Once we make the decision I see no point in hiding it; the players know where they stand then,\" said the former Gloucestershire coach. \"But it may still go the morning of the match.\" New Zealand trail 1-0 in the three-match series after a seven-wicket defeat a fortnight ago, a similar situation to their last tour in 1999 when they came from behind to win. \"They like to feel like their backs are to the wall, they like that bit of edge,\" Bracewell said. \"It may be the thing they need to stimulate them into action. \"Having said that, I am not too desperate about what happened at Lord's, there were just a few mistakes made that cost us, it could have gone the other way. \"It could be one mistake either way that decides this match so we will have to hang tough.\" Bracewell has attempted to utilise the movement available in Leeds by employing Englishman Kevin Cooper, a prolific seamer with Nottinghamshire in the 1980s, as a temporary bowling coach. Cooper, one of only a handful of English bowlers to take 100 first-class wickets in a season over the past two decades, has been preaching the value of ball maintenance to a fledgling Kiwi attack given experience by the presence of Chris Cairns. Meanwhile, fast bowler Shane Bond, who suffered a setback in his attempts to recover from a stress fracture of the back, sent down five overs in the Headingley nets today, his most serious workout since playing in the tour match against Kent three weeks ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
