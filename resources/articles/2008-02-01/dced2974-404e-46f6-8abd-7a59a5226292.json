Like the shimmering in the sand, Pakistan's elections are another illusion - that of the military-bureaucratic establishment handing over power to elected politicians. There is no doubt Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf holds the keys to the polls. He has picked three organ-grinders to turn the handle of the elections. The first is the caretaker government, which oversees the polls and is headed by President Musharraf's handpicked prime minister, Muhammadmian Somroo. The next is the judiciary, which once threatened the army with legal oversight and then found itself decapitated. When in November President Musharraf asked who will rid me of these troublesome judges - up stepped the army to impose a state of emergency. Sixty sacked judges and an imprisoned chief justice later and the judiciary are back firmly on the side of the establishment. Given what has happened with the bewigged, it is not much of a stretch to imagine whether the election commission has the confidence to act independently of the government. Will it not too yield to pressure on polling day? Yes. Will it entertain complaints? Yes momentarily, for the sake of appearances, before dismissing them. Of course these are only impressions, but consider Pakistan's missing millions of voters. Last time Pakistan went to the polls in what is now considered a highly flawed poll in 2002, the electorate numbered more than 70m. In 2008, this has shrunk by more than 10 million voters. Either the counters were lying then or they are lying now. The former means the present government is illegal, the latter points to rigging on a massive scale. Neither can be good for democracy in Pakistan. Little of this is making an impact. The watchdogs have been muzzled. Under the state of emergency the media remains banned from broadcasting political speeches live. President Musharraf burnished his liberal credentials by creating briefly the sparkiest fourth estate in the Muslim world. However the halo has slipped recently - like the country's rating on the world press freedom index which now sees the country ranked 157 out of 167 nations. Given all this President Musharraf still promises to hold fair, free and peaceful elections. The evidence suggests otherwise. With suicide attacks and bombings punctuating the hustings, it no surprise politics in Pakistan lacks the elan of previous contests. What is disconcerting is that the political parties know all this but have decided to run anyway. The polls, too, hold a siren call - suggesting a wave for late Benazir's Pakistan People's party. Nawaz Sharif, who once swept to power in a landslide in 1997 but whose party was reduced to less than 20 seats in 2002, thinks President Musharraf might be impeached so he scrambles to join hands with his arch rival. These appear fanciful in the light of recent history. The military in Pakistan has always held cod-elections as a part of their efforts to soften and legitimise their rule. Who will call the army's bluff? Don't look at Washington. The CIA say that the \"central leadership of al-Qaida are based in the border area of Pakistan\". President Bush will no doubt be thanking his Pakistani counterpart for the elections as soon as the polling booths close. And his price will be that more Pakistani troops are sent to seek and destroy the militants. The grubby little secret is that these elections are just a way of co-opting tame political leaders. The military and its civilian acolytes in the bureaucracy are determined to create the conditions whereby the chances of an independent leader being elected are slim if not non-existent. If he or she did come about miraculously, these shadowy actors would slowly move to isolate and defeat their adversary because the rest of the institutions of the state are in their hands. Yet Pakistan's politicians have fallen for it. The prize of power appears too great. But it is just a mirage. Only when the parties abandon the chase for this chimera and take on the establishment that runs the country will Pakistan lay the foundations of a democratic state."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
