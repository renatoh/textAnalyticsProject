Iraq, cradle of civilisation, has three, and Belgium, famous for its beer and waffles and much else that is good (but, let us be frank, nothing that quite matches Babylon and Nineveh), boasts 10. There is scant fairness in the distribution of world heritage sites, and the UN body that confers this sought-after status knows it: in 1994 it announced a global strategy for a \"balanced and representative\" list, determined to tackle the glaring European, Judaeo-Christian bias. But as its members draw its 34th session to a close tomorrow, having inscribed some new sites and placed others on the list of those in danger, there is more to think about than who wins this exalted numbers game (it's Italy, with a whopping 44). In PR terms, Unesco's scheme for raising awareness of historic monuments and natural wonders has been a success (less glamorous UN organs would kill for the kind of press attention given to the world heritage committee's annual pronouncements). Lists capture the imagination. The idea of a catalogue of marvels, including a rundown of the very best in human achievement, from the Pyramids to Versailles, is an instinctively appealing one. But the world heritage convention wasn't set up in the spirit of Saturday-night talent-show marathons. Its aim was to preserve and protect, to harness the kind of international energy that went into rescuing the Temple of Philae from the rising waters of the Nile in the early 1960s. And with good PR come visitors \u2013 in their hundreds of thousands \u2013 where previously far fewer had set foot. Tourism can, of course, be done well or done badly. Rich countries tend to be able to balance the increased stress on buildings or natural habitats with their own protective measures. But support for poorer ones is very limited: each year Unesco's world heritage fund distributes just $4m worth of assistance, around a third of that spent in 2009 by the World Monuments Fund, a private charity. Which brings us back to numbers. There are now around 900 world heritage sites, up from 335 in 1990. The addition of tens more each year affects the credibility of the whole enterprise: \"world heritage\" begins to look like hyperbole. And yet the recognition of cultural bias is likely to push the number ever higher, as more sites in Africa and the Arab world get a look-in. An effective solution would be to slash the number of world heritage sites back to 1990s levels: knock a few French chateaus and German schlosses down a peg or two, and focus scarce resources and expertise where they are not already available in abundance. Otherwise, what more do we have than a tourist information leaflet for the world?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
