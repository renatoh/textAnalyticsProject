Among characters such as trustafarian teenagers and high-maintenance mums, one sketch is Sexy Baby \u2013 a music video that skewers Ariana Grande\u2019s aesthetic and features neon pink, ponytails, adult nappies and so much more. So how do you make the perfect pop parody? Let\u2019s get a guide from the experts \u2026 1. Wig out Natasia Demetriou You have got to have as many wigs as possible. Ellie White Pop your hair under a wig. You want to take the viewer to a fantasy. ND You want colours that don\u2019t match your eyebrows. You want as much texture as possible. And you want them so wide, they block your co-star, or so short you can see the shape of your skull. 2. Eat to the beat Both Very heavy, rich catering on set. EW Like a lamb stew for lunch. ND Or, cos I don\u2019t eat meat, a pasta with a rich cream sauce. Preferably with truffles. You have to feel the full bass of the music in your digestive system. I suffer from IBS so I\u2019m severely constipated at all times. I don\u2019t mind you printing that because awareness of IBS is very important. If you can incorporate anything to do with the toilet into a parody \u2026 EW \u2026 you\u2019re on to a winner. 3. Get into the groove ND You need a deep understanding of the beat to really hone the parody. And an enthusiasm to move. Don\u2019t be afraid to walk to the catering and help yourself to another truffle. Then number four is \u2026 4. Hide yourself behind some very, very accomplished dancers ND \u2026 pepper the music video with some absolutely unbelievable dancers. EW So they make the whole thing seem legit. ND Having an enthusiasm to move doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the Lord has blessed you with the feet to do so. You need some other people to take the slack. 5. A deep respect for the people you parody ND Our parody is a comment on videos that feature young girls talking about mature subjects whilst being really cute. There\u2019s an Ariana Grande song where she sings about \u2026 EW \u2026 not being able to walk cos she\u2019s been fucked so hard. But she\u2019s got a bow in her hair and looks quite childlike. 6. Avoid pop icons such as \u2026 EW Beyonc\u00e9. Wouldn\u2019t touch her with a bargepole. ND She\u2019s got too much self-awareness. EW What are you going to take the piss out of? ND I would never find it funny to take the piss out of Barbra Streisand. EW And Slipknot. Untouchable. Ellie &amp; Natasia is on the BBC iPlayer now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
