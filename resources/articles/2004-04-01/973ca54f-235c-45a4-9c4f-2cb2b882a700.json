They had refused to play for Zimbabwe, demanding the reinstatement of Heath Streak as captain, a new selection panel and other concessions. The ZCU is expected to bring in a mediator, Much Musunda, to deal with both sides of the row. They are now expected to return to practice on Friday, a week before the first Test against Sri Lanka and in time for Australia's planned tour later in May. The announcement comes just 24 hours after Grant Flower, one of Zimbabwe's senior batsman, declared they were still a long way from reaching an agreement with the ZCU. \"You can take it from me we will not be at practice,\" he said yesterday. \"We want to resolve this but the ZCU's cocked it up. The arbitration panel's chairman is out of the country and so is our lawyer. What are they thinking?\" A shadow side, captained by Tatenda Taibu, are 4-0 down against Sri Lanka in a one-day international series, with the final match on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
