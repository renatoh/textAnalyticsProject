Instead, the matter was shamefully hijacked and exploited by many sections of the British press to infuse yet another tedious bout of the europhobia that has for too long been the foundation of EU reporting. Since the UK joined the Common Market in 1973, tales have abounded of an overweening bureaucracy attempting to wrest control of Britain into its own hands. Continual warnings of \"barmy EU edicts\" issued by \"faceless eurocrats\", which have surreptitiously impinged upon British life to deleterious effect have proliferated. Indeed, were every portentous prediction to have come to fruition we would now be living in a kind of Orwellian dystopia, with many aspects of British life, from the minutiae to the monumental, preordained by the abstract monolith known as \"Brussels\". As with all political institutions the EU must have its workings and policies brought to light and subjected to vigorous scrutiny by the media. Even the most ardent europhile would concede that there is ample scope for constructive, considered criticism. But if the agenda that spawns euro-myths is that membership of the EU is of such damaging consequence to the UK, then surely there are more cogent arguments to be advanced than those concerning the size of peaches and the banning of corgis? If the eurosceptic argument is so strong, then why does the need for insidious invention remain? The point is often made that my office at the European commission representation should utilise the press complaints commission to respond to such articles, but it has proved an impractical and inefficient course to pursue. On the one occasion this route was taken the protracted negotiations with both the PCC and the newspaper concerned, and the subsequent result, were beyond unsatisfactory. We pursued a case following a three-tier headline, double-page article in the Mail on Sunday which contained a plethora of lies and misinformation on a commission-run shop. After two months of frustrating negotiations with first, as required, the newspaper concerned, and subsequently the PCC, the upshot was the publication of a desultorily small correction and a rebuttal letter - a result diluted by its retrospection, and hardly an adequate counterbalance to the impact of the initial article. Yet it is not merely the procedural logistics of the PCC that undermine its effectiveness, rather the whole ethos behind the watchdog. A key tenet of the PCC's claims for self-regulation of the press is that the code derives its strength because it is set and applied by those who must abide by it - ie the newspapers themselves. The PCC's website claims that \"self -regulation works because the newspaper and magazine publishing industry is committed to it.\" Thus, in theory, self-regulation produces an industry that holds the code in such reverence that the veracity of stories is exhaustively researched, and corrections and letters of rebuttal willingly printed upon recognition of a \"significant inaccuracy, misleading statement, or distorted report\". The actuality however, as experienced by my office, is substantially different. The prevailing attitude amongst the press seems to be that they cannot believe the EU has the temerity to respond to any allegations, however spurious. In the case of stories that I would readily agree are of a humorous nature, as opposed to those that are laughable, the accusation is levelled that the commission is being po-faced for considering them worthy of refutation. Against a backdrop of consistently objective criticism of the EU and non-prejudicial coverage of EU affairs, it would be plausible to accept them as innocuously frivolous. When they constitute such a vast proportion of coverage, to the extent that the public perception of the EU has irrefutably come to be defined in such limited terms, they cannot be treated so magnanimously. Ultimately, there is simply no incentive for newspapers to check their facts before running the inevitably inaccurate eurosceptic story. In theory the PCC's code of practice and self-control via self-regulation are an inducement to accuracy. The reality is precisely the opposite: the journalistic complacency that derives from being untouchable and unaccountable, two accusations that are readily directed towards the institutions of the EU. This, when mingled with the type of editorialising copy - again in complete violation of the code - seen in so-called news stories (\"... the cretins in land-locked Brussels...\", Daily Mail, January 24) somewhat contradicts the grandiose claim of the PCC that self-regulation \"combines high standards of ethical reporting with a free press.\" Rather, it certainly guarantees the latter, whilst legitimising fabrication via the comfortable charade of supposed adherence to the code. The correlation between the national newspapers represented on the PCC's code of practice committee, and those that are the worst exponents of europhobic pretence is too striking to engender confidence in the current system. But even with a more rigorous application of the principles of self-regulation it would be unlikely that the current approach to reporting EU affairs would alter dramatically. With political procrastination over the UK's role in Europe and the media pandering to the baser nationalistic interests of its readership, there can be no serious basis for discussion. Until stronger political leadership indicates that Britain is committed to fulfilling its role as a vital partner within the EU, there can be no expectation of a higher standard of EU reporting. To this end the prime minister's recent condemnation of the europhobic press is to be warmly welcomed. At this crucial stage of the EU's evolution, it is to be hoped that the government as a whole will continue to inform the debate constructively. Only then can the British public's absurd deception at the hands of the eurosceptic media ever be tackled effectively. \u00b7 Jim Dougal is head of the European commission representation in the UK.
