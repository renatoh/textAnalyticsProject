After five seasons on Merseyside, most of which would be worthy of applause, Houllier is under pressure to produce. The Frenchman needs no reminding. A fifth-placed finish in May represented Liverpool's worst league standing since 1999, when his reign was in its infancy. Last term they suffered a miserable and inexplicable 11-match winless streak that eroded their position at the top in November and failure to regain entry to Europe's elite at Chelsea on the final day was a costly wake-up call. Since assuming the reins from the ill-advised joint-management venture with Roy Evans in November 1998, Houllier's tenancy has yielded two League Cups, a Uefa Cup, an FA Cup, second place in the Premiership and two seasons of Champions League football. That trophy haul remains impressive even if he has spent massively en route - more than \u00a3100m - though the dissatisfaction sweeping through Anfield at the end of last season suggested memories are short. \"We'd progressed for five years on the trot,\" said Michael Owen. \"Last season was a step back.\" Another failure to reach the top four could have serious repercussions not only for Houllier's position, which has never previously been under threat, but also for the club's finances. The boardroom readily admit that this summer's \u00a38.5m outlay on transfers, combined with the substantial salaries taken on to the wage bill, represents a risk in the current climate. \"I can understand the frustrations,\" said Houllier, who claims his side reached \"an inevitable phase of plateau\" last year. \"We finished fifth and we weren't at all happy with that. That is why our targets are higher this season. I expect more and so do my players. They enjoy their football and they have genuine qualities, so they just need to keep the self-belief and the team unity that we've had for most of my time here.\" It was the self-belief that took such a battering last season but it is hoped that what is still an essentially youthful squad will have learned enough from those harrowing experiences to avoid a repeat this time. However, it was Liverpool's style of play that prompted the most gnawing frustration. They adopted a cautious approach and lacked sparkle in the centre and pizzazz on the flanks. That problem, too, appears to have been addressed with the signing of Steve Finnan, Fulham's attack-minded full-back, and Harry Kewell. Kewell holds the key. He joined Liverpool from Leeds on the back of a promise to play in a specific position, yet he has spent pre-season flitting from right to left wing with only fleeting appearances in the central role that he craves. When he did find a niche behind the strikers, against Aberdeen, he wreaked havoc. Houllier must find a system to conjure the best from Kewell if Liverpool are to thrive. Should he prove successful, then Liverpool could yet emerge from Arsenal's shadow and Chelsea's spending frenzy to become Manchester United's most credible challengers. Sir Alex Ferguson has stated as much, though the only player to have publicly talked up the chances of a first title since 1990, Dietmar Hamann, succumbed to a shin injury within 24 hours as if jinxed. \"The squad now is the strongest we've had since I've been here,\" said the German, ruled out until November. Suffice to say, most are now keeping shtoom. For all their successes in the cup competitions Houllier's reign will be judged by what his team achieves in the league. On his appointment in 1998 the Frenchman with the reputation as a meticulous planner spoke of \"evolution, not revolution\". \"It took Alex Ferguson two years, maybe longer, even to get things moving in the right direction,\" he said. \"He probably had five years but we don't have that here.\" Houllier certainly has things moving in the right direction. The porous defence he inherited has long since been overhauled and there have been trophies to relish. But the greatest step has yet to be taken. The fans believed the title was within reach after the heady second-place finish in 2002 which made last season's failings all the more frustrating. \"We want, first of all, to get back into the top three,\" added Houllier. \"You cannot programme success and you can only win things at the highest level when you have been through adversity. The ambition and the target remains the league. We just need a bit more time.\" After five years, however, that may be running out.
