There have been shortages on toilet paper and groceries, a run on alcohol and, perhaps most surprisingly, on hens. In the week to 21 March, Google search interest in \u201clive chickens\u201d reached its highest point in five years. The ABC reported chickens were in huge demand. Catherine Smith, chairperson of NSW Hen Rescue, a small charity that focuses on rehoming battery hens, noticed an influx of emails. \u201cBut not necessarily in the way we would like,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting a lot of messages saying \u2018I need to buy hens for eggs\u2019 ... It\u2019s been a very big focus on the eggs, whereas we\u2019re an organisation that focuses on the hens.\u201d While she hastens to add that many of her recent applicants have been credible, \u201cThere\u2019s been a big increase, and they\u2019ve been quite impatient. It\u2019s been an interesting experience, dealing with those enquiries.\u201d Fiona Scott-Norman, who wrote a book on Australians\u2019 love of chooks in 2019 \u2013 This Chicken Life \u2013 puts it bluntly: \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re the new toilet paper.\u201d But Smith, Scott-Norman and RSPCA\u2019s scientific officer Dr Sarah Babington all warn that a backyard chicken coop is not an easy egg fix, if the supermarket runs low. \u201cThey\u2019re not something you can just put in your backyard and leave. They require a lot of care,\u201d says Babington. \u201cHens \u2026 are very social creatures,\u201d Babington explains. Would-be hen parents need to keep at least three, so the birds do not get lonely. They also require space to explore, a nutritious diet (household scraps won\u2019t be enough), nests, perches, dust baths, an enriching environment, veterinary care and Fort-Knox like protection from predators. \u201cThe great tragedy of the chicken is it tastes good to everyone and everything,\u201d says Scott-Norman, who recently lost her own flock to a very persistent fox. \u201cOnce [foxes are] on the beat, they\u2019re on the beat. They\u2019re waiting for you to slip up.\u201d Most of all, chickens need affection. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a dog or cat,\u201d says Babington. Smith and Scott-Norman suggest that if you do not get to know your chickens, and their individual personalities, you\u2019re missing out on the best part of owning them. \u201cThey crawl over you, and they\u2019re preening you,\u201d says Smith of her hens\u2019 friendly nature. Then, there\u2019s the clean-up. \u201cThey do poop a lot,\u201d Scott-Norman says. \u201cThe bigger the chicken, the bigger the poop.\u201d Though she adds, \u201cthere\u2019s something homey about the smell of chicken poop\u201d and even waste has its uses. \u201cIt is black gold. It\u2019s great fertiliser.\u201d Smith fears \u201cwe\u2019re going to get inundated with surrenders\u201d from unprepared new owners. \u201cIt\u2019s a very worrying time.\u201d However, for those that have done their research; have enough space (Smith recommends an area of 10m2 for a flock of five); are prepared for the set-up costs and ongoing veterinary bills; know how they\u2019ll keep their flock warm in winter and cool in summer; and have ensured their flock complies with council regulations, chickens can be brilliant pets. \u201cThey\u2019re productive pets. The whole package,\u201d says Scott-Norman. \u201cMy experience is if you want chickens and you get chickens you will fall in love with them.\u201d Just do not expect them to start laying eggs right away, says Smith. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from breeders of people buying hens, and then being frustrated that they\u2019re not laying yet. It\u2019s a process, it happens when it happens.\u201d Not all chickens are even bred for regular laying, and those that are \u2013 Isa Browns \u2013 come with a host of health complications associated with the stress of producing eggs every day. As a result of these complications, many of Smith\u2019s hens are on a hormonal implant to stop them from laying, at a cost of $300 a year. \u201cThe thing about chickens is that they\u2019re incredibly resilient \u2026 but they will also get a panoply of afflictions and will occasionally drop dead,\u201d says Scott-Norman, who suggests keeping chickens for companionship, and treating the eggs \u201cas a bonus\u201d. Choosing to keep hens also comes with a community of like-minded people. Scott-Norman says local Facebook groups are a useful resource if you\u2019re just starting out, and Babington suggests that people turn to their local poultry club for more information about chicken ownership. Poultry clubs are also the best places to find a reputable breeders. Or, if you\u2019ve ensured you can take care of a rescue chicken\u2019s specialised needs, you can adopt a few. Ultimately, Scott-Norman is optimistic about a boom in backyard hen adoption, provided the animals are well cared for. \u201cWe\u2019re always delighted when people choose to join Team Chicken,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re really smart and hugely fun. They\u2019ve got stuff going on ... there\u2019s always chicken business. While you\u2019re isolating, chickens are the best. It\u2019s like chicken TV.\u201d She also touts their mental health benefits. \u201cThe more people have chickens the more calm people are, the more in touch with the land,\u201d she concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s a win. It\u2019s a total win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
