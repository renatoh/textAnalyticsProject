The magazines were the foundation of a publishing and marketing empire so successful that, in 1982, Johnson became the first black man to crack Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans. His greatest success, Ebony, launched in 1945, was patterned after such magazines as Life and Look, which were staples in pre-television white America. With a current circulation of 1.6m, Ebony has, in fact, far outlived its models. Johnson's philosophy was that: \"Negroes got married, had beauty contests, gave parties, ran successful businesses, and did all the other normal things of life.\" With its emphasis on success stories and consumerism, Ebony was the first black publication to attract mainstream white advertising. Johnson did that by building a close personal rapport with the president of the Zenith appliance company, until the president had no qualms about advertising to Johnson's readership. Soon after, the boom in sales of television sets reached the black community, creating a bonanza for both Zenith and Ebony. Although Johnson was sometimes criticised for showing only the bright side of life, his magazines were at the forefront of the civil rights struggle. Johnson started Jet, a tabloid version of Ebony, in 1951, concentrating on celebrities and gossip. But four years later, Jet ran an open-coffin photograph of Emmett Till, a Chicago boy, aged 14, murdered in Mississippi because he was said to have whistled at a white woman. Some of Johnson's staff had reservations about running such a graphic and inflammatory picture. Although he shared some of their reservations, Johnson decided \"it was our responsibility to print it and let the world experience man's inhumanity to man\". According to Jesse Jackson, who worked in the Johnson dispatch room when he was young, Jet's coverage of Till's death inspired Rosa Parks to refuse to give up her seat on a Birmingham, Alabama, bus, in December 1955, thus sparking the civil rights movement. A decade later, in the middle of the urban upheaval of the 1960s, Johnson ran a cover story with the headline \"The White Problem In America\". He often advised blacks who wanted to go into business to avoid white firms, unless they could be satisfied with never being more than a vice president. Johnson, who was the grandson of slaves, was born in Arkansas; he had to repeat his year in the eighth grade at school, because his town had no high school for black students. His father had died in a saw mill accident. He moved to Chicago with his mother in 1933, after they visited the World's Fair; there both he and his stepfather worked in New Deal programmes to get through the depression. John also got into an all-black high school, where he excelled, was president of his class and edited the school paper. His speech to the Chicago Urban League after his graduation so impressed black insurance company owner Henry Pace that he offered Johnson a job and a scholarship to the University of Chicago. Though Johnson dropped out of university, he was editor of the company's in-house magazine, and he pored over the available black press. In 1942, a year after his marriage, Johnson borrowed $500 against the security of his mother's furniture, and mailed 20,000 insurance policyholders, asking them to subscribe to a new magazine. When 3,000 responded with $2 each, he started Negro Digest, which was based on Reader's Digest. He persuaded friends to ask newsagents for copies, then bought up those copies and sold them back to the distributor as demand increased. He soon built up a nationwide circulation of 50,000. His wife, Eunice, came up with the title Ebony for his next venture, a glossy weekly (now monthly), intended to be the black Life magazine. Ebony was an instant success, but that did not eliminate racial problems. When Johnson wanted to buy a headquarters for his publications, the building's owners would not sell to a black man. While his white lawyer arranged the purchase, Johnson inspected the building, disguised as a maintenance man in overalls. In 1971, Johnson built a new company headquarters on Michigan Avenue, and so became the first black business to move into Chicago's most prestigious address. The Johnson empire also included the hugely successful Fashion Fair Cosmetics company, which he formed in 1973, when models on his wife's fashion fair tours found it hard to buy make-up suited to black skin. Johnson did very well in the white world, but he famously said he preferred to be \"king of the black hill\". And king he remained, not stepping down as CEO of his company until 2002, when his daughter, Linda Johnson Rice, succeeded him. She survives him, as does his wife; his son, John Harold Jr, died in 1981. \u00b7 John Harold Johnson, magazine publisher, born January 19 1918; died August 8 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
