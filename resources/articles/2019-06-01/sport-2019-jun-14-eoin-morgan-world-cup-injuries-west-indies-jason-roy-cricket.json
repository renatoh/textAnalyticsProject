The England captain and the opener Roy face a struggle to be fit for Tuesday\u2019s game against Afghanistan at Old Trafford \u2013 back and hamstring problems respectively prevented them from batting in the successful chase of 213. Morgan, who was forced by his predicament to stand up during his post-match press conference, said: \u201cIt is sore. I have had back spasms before \u2013 we think it\u2019s that \u2013 and they normally take a few days to settle down. We\u2019ll know more in the next 24 hours. \u201cI don\u2019t know how [Roy] pulled up \u2013 he\u2019ll have a scan and it will take 48 hours to get the full results. When any two players go down it\u2019s a worry but we\u2019re not at panic stations. We\u2019ll do a risk assessment before the Afghanistan game.\u201d Roy certainly appeared to be the more troubling of the two, having walked off in the eighth over after turning to run for a miscued pull shot from Chris Gayle that flew over the infield. The opener did not return during the remainder of the West Indies innings, nor feature in England\u2019s subsequent cruise to their target, having been barred from batting higher than No 7 due to time off the field. It is not the first time Roy has suffered the injury. He spent seven weeks on the sidelines this year when suffering a strain to the same hamstring and it will be hoped that this recurrence is not as serious. James Vince, who has one ODI half-century to his name, is the reserve batsman in the squad. Another option, in theory, is Moeen Ali, who opened for England in the last World Cup to useful effect but averages 15 with the bat in the past 12 months, albeit chiefly down the order. When England dropped Alex Hales before the World Cup, following his 21-day ban for recreational drug use, it was said he would not be selected again this summer. Joe Denly, therefore, appears to be next in line for a call-up should Roy be out altogether \u2013 something England will do only as a last resort, given replacements are permanent. Morgan, meanwhile, was forced off in the 40th over of the match. Running to the stumps at the bowler\u2019s end when fielding, the England captain pulled up and then appeared in greater discomfort than Roy when hobbling back to the pavilion. The captain\u2019s absence should hopefully be minimal with rest and treatment and his deputy, Jos Buttler, is on standby to lead at Old Trafford on Tuesday should that fixture come too soon for a return. Despite obvious discomfort, Morgan was keen to praise Joe Root\u2019s unbeaten 100 from 94 balls, having been pressed into opening and putting on 95 with Jonny Bairstow, sealing the match through a 104-run stand with the auxiliary No 3, Chris Woakes. \u201cJoe was exceptional,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cHe is the glue that holds everything together, and a side of his batting that\u2019s got better over the last two or three years, that people haven\u2019t seen a lot of, is his expansive game. He never seems to go at less than a run a ball. You look up and he\u2019s going at better than a run ball.\u201d It was not all bad news on the fitness front either. Mark Wood, arguably England\u2019s most physically fragile player, passed a fitness test on a bruised left ankle but tore in for figures of three for 18 in 6.4 overs. West Indies, meanwhile, face Bangladesh in Taunton on Monday and will once again go into the match with doubts over the fitness of Andre Russell. The all-rounder, who is managing long-standing knee problems, suffered a wrist injury while batting and then pulled up in the 11th over of England\u2019s chase. It came when falling over after sending down a bouncer that hit Bairstow on the helmet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
