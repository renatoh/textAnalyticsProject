On Saturday, the Australian reported that the RACP had \u201cagreed to do the inquiry\u201d after being asked to by Hunt. Hunt had received complaints about healthcare for trans children from a group including former deputy president of Fred Nile\u2019s Christian Democratic Party, Dr John Whitehall, and psychology professor Dianna Kenny, both vocal opponents of trans healthcare. In a post on its site on Tuesday, the RACP published Hunt\u2019s letter in which he called on the college to \u201curgently consider and advise on the clinical best practice for the treatment of gender dysphoria in children and adolescents\u201d. \u201cIt is important that we have a nationally consistent standard of care that is evidence based and with appropriate safeguards to protect the interests of the patient. I look forward to receiving your advice in the coming months,\u201d he said. The RACP said on Tuesday it would consult committees and experts to respond to Hunt, but clarified that the RACP is \u201cprimarily an educational institution and does not conduct inquiries\u201d. The RACP said the organisation was strongly supportive and welcoming for people experiencing gender dysphoria, and noted the Australian standard for care for treating transgender and gender diverse children and adolescents. On Monday the ABC\u2019s Media Watch criticised the Australian for its renewed focus on transgender issues, including the creation of a \u201cgender\u201d page on its website, containing almost completely negative coverage of trans issues. Media Watch reported the Australian had written at least 18 stories in the past two weeks on gender, almost completely negative. The Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH) \u2013 the peak body for healthcare professionals working in trans and gender diverse healthcare \u2013 issued a statement criticising the coverage. \u201cWe see the harm that inaccurate and biased reporting in the media can have on these young people and their families,\u201d AusPATH said. \u201cIgnoring the facts in the reporting on this issue is irresponsible and, most importantly, not in the best interest of these young people due to the significant harm it causes.\u201d The group noted a study of the mental health of trans young people in Australia found high rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm, with 48% of trans and gender diverse young people under the age of 24 attempting suicide. In response, the Australian published a story claiming Associate Professor Michelle Telfer, the lead signatory on the letter from doctors who work in trans healthcare, failed to disclose she worked for the Royal children\u2019s hospital in Melbourne, the hospital behind the trans healthcare standards document endorsed by AusPATH and RACP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
