Woods had given every indication that his game was back on track until a bogey-bogey finish left him having to settle for a four-under-par 68. The world number one had made the most of favourable morning conditions and generous pin positions as he claimed five birdies on the front nine. 'I hit so many good shots,' he said. 'All the hard work is starting to pay off , things are starting to come together and each and every day is starting to get a little bit better.' By the time he reached the 17th tee, Woods was six under par. One more birdie on the closing two holes and there was no doubt that the man who began the tournament with an error-strewn 75 would be firmly in contention. But his tee shot to the famous island green 143 yards away barely cleared the water and landed in the narrow collar of rough in front of the pin. His short game had been immaculate throughout the round, but this time his pitch shot failed to climb up the slope to the hole and his 12ft par putt slipped by. More disappointment followed at the 18th after finding the ideal position from the tee. Instead of finding the green, his ball cannoned off the cart path to the right of the green and ended up in the stands. 'The wind switched, it was in my face which meant it was a perfect seven [iron] then when I was over the ball and took the club back, the wind switched and I had too much club and I had to ease off on it,' he said. 'I should have just backed off the shot, but I tried to open the face up, add a little loft and cut it and it just flared off to the right.' Woods' admission to this indecision is revealing. At his best he would have backed off - after all this is a man who can abort a downswing at the click of a shutter. Instead, he cost himself another shot to par. Even though he has been doing a great line in positive thinking this week, Woods admitted to frustration at the way his round closed. 'I am pleased with how well I played, but to finish the way I did is not that exciting, because I was right there. I could still be in reach. Now I've got to birdie two holes early just to get back to where I was at one point. It is frustrating. Any time you finish bogey-bogey it's going to leave a bad taste in your mouth.' Woods had been looking for the sort of round achieved by another of the early starters, Craig Parry. His eight-under-par 64 began with a bogey but contained two eagles and eight birdies. 'It was an amazing round,' said the Australian who won the Ford Championship at Doral at the beginning of the month. He started the day in joint last, but by the completion of his round he was contemplating the possibility of another win. 'There are so many good players here and it's hard to score like that two days in a row, but I've given myself a chance.' England's Paul Casey gave himself the chance to secure significant world ranking points to boost his bid to make the European Ryder Cup team with a third-round 69 that took him to five under par for the tournament. It was marred only when he pulled his drive at the last into the water that runs down the left side of the hole. Casey, who led the statistics for finding greens in regulation on the first two days, chipped in for a birdie at the 12th in a spell of four birdies in five holes. On this form Bernhard Langer will want him on his side. Darren Clarke threatened to make inroads on the leaderboard, but faltered badly on the back nine. The Ulsterman went to the turn in a three-under-par 33 and at the 11th claimed a magnificent eagle, smashing a 242-yard approach to gimme range. But then his round fell apart. He bogeyed the 12th and 14th holes and at the 15th racked up a double-bogey six, before dropping another shot at the 18th. He already knows he won't be winning the Players Championship, the tournament regarded as the fifth major. Woods can probably make the same assumption.
