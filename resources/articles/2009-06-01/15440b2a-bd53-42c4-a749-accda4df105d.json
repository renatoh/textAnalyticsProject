In David Alden's staging, Gideon Davey's set is a large room where the Forester, made up to look like the ageing composer, dreams of the Vixen - one of his operatic heroines inspired by his real life love for the much younger Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1 - only to find his space increasingly invaded by the insects and animals depicted on the walls until the forest and the human world are one. This works well on the whole. If some of the peasant merrymaking, choreographed by Ben Wright, becomes intrusive, this also suggests a more positive and cohesive community than the original's sad quartet of failures, drinking their lives away in the pub. But much of it is wittily presented, with the activities of the animals sharply and unsentimentally sketched in. When Ailish Tynan's vital Vixen marries Frances Bourne's would-be sophisticated Fox, their wedding cake is made from dead rabbits. Tynan's cleanly sung Vixen represents the life-force of the animal kingdom, just as Robert Poulton's rich-toned Forester suggests one man's growing awareness not just of the beauty and cruelty of the natural world, but of his own mortality. On the environmentally destructive side, David Stout's poacher Harasta is jovially arrogant. Though the English Chamber Orchestra struggle to register the infinitesimal detail and tonal beauty of Jan\u00e1cek's rich, but idiosyncratic writing, conductor Andr\u00e9 de Ridder energises the piece. However, using an English translation of the Czech libretto would have removed a barrier between the audience and this clever and intermittently enchanting show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
