East Riding of Yorkshire council found it could only terminate his membership and stop paying his allowance after he had failed to attend any council meetings for six months. John Lyle, an independent Labour member, attended a meeting in July and then went to China to take up a teaching position. When the council found out his new job through a local newspaper, it wrote to his home address in Bridlington warning him that he must attend at least one council meeting within a six month period to continue to qualify as a councillor. But the authority heard nothing from him and he was struck off when his sixth months ended on January 31. A spokesman for East Riding council said: \"The council can confirm that Mr Lyle has not attended a meeting, nor has he provided an explanation for his absence, so under the Local Government Act he ceases to be a councillor.\" But the council has discovered that, under the act, it cannot attempt to claw back the six months of his \u00a38,850 annual allowance which he claimed, even though he was not representing his constituency. The case has highlighted a loophole in local government law, but the standards board for England said no similar instances had been reported to it. A spokeswoman said: \"What councillors should do is inform their authority that there may be difficulties and agree terms for their absence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
