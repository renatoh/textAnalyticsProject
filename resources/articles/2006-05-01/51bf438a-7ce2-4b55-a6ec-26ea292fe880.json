Here, a CV specialist and an employer suggest how he could improve his CV. Presentation Katy Wilson, senior consultant, The CV Centre An introductory profile is exactly what is needed at the top of a CV like Derrick's. However, as this is the first part of the CV the reader will tackle, it is important that it is well written. Beyond this, my overall impression of Derrick's CV is that, while it is definitely above average and avoids many of the most common mistakes, it is not particularly pleasing to the eye or easy for the reader to scan quickly. Each position within the Museum &amp; Gallery Experience section uses a solid block of text, making it very hard to take in at a glance - which is all the recruiter will have time for in the first instance. However, the Corporate Experience section is, by contrast, neatly divided into concise bullet points, which has much greater impact and is easier to read. Apart from the bold section headings, no other information really stands out from the page. I would recommend using bold text for the job titles and organisations and companies he has worked for, to form subheadings for the subsequent bullet points. As with his employment history, Derrick's qualifications can certainly be better presented. For example: the title of his MA should be highlighted in bold so as to match the layout of his employment history, with the course topics listed underneath, again using bullet points. Finally, there is no mention of any hobbies, interests or personal achievements, which may well add value to his CV by bringing out a little bit more of his individuality. Employability Tom Engel, head of communications, Natural History Museum This CV would go straight to the reject pile - a shame, since it seems to suggest someone with an interesting background, great experience and commitment to the sector. The Summary reads as a stream of generic jargon, with no feel for Derrick's personal qualities and achievements. It contains the phrase \"detailed oriented\", which made me wince. There are numerous errors of syntax and grammar, and the layout is inconsistent. Some of the dates given for educational courses cover the same period as those given for one of the jobs listed. There may well be a perfectly good explanation for this - if it indicates part-time study, that would be a plus point - but with no explanation, it just looks shifty. Similarly, the account of his first experience at university suggests that he may have left before graduating (because it lists courses but no qualification), but does not explain this. Derrick's CV gives me no sense of who he is. Reading between the lines, he has moved from the corporate sector, qualified in museum management and put real effort into unpaid roles to build up a track record in this sector. Unfortunately, that is not what the CV tells me. The CV could be vastly improved by using a more personal profile or summary up front and a personal interests section at the end to give some shape. By moving the employment section ahead of his educational record, Derrick could emphasise both the relevance of his experience and his commitment to working in museums and galleries. He needs to shed the mundane tone, stressing his personal role and accomplishments in the various tasks he lists. Finally, he needs to befriend a merciless proofreader. Was it helpful? Derrick says: \"The advice has made me look at my CV more objectively. The changes suggested by Katy Wilson are very useful and I will include many of the creative formatting options. The views of Tom Engel are critical but give me a clear idea of what someone in the industry is looking for.\" \u00b7 If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of some CV surgery, send your CV to rise@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
