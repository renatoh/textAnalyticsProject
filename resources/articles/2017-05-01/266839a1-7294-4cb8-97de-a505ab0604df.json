Women on Web, which is based in Amsterdam, helps connect women with doctors who can provide abortion pills if they live in countries where abortion access is restricted. It is a sister organization to Women on Waves, which provides abortions and other reproductive health services on a ship in international waters. Women on Waves announced that the page had been \u201cunpublished\u201d on its own Facebook account, writing: \u201cWomen on Web provides life-saving information to thousands of women worldwide. Its Facebook page publishes news, scientific information and the protocols of the World Health Organization and Women on Web has answered over half a million emails with women who needed scientific, accurate information essential for their health and life. \u201cWe expect Facebook will [undo] this action soon enough, as access to information is a human right.\u201d This is the second censorship row between Facebook and Women on Web. In January 2012, Facebook deleted the profile photograph of the group\u2019s founder and director, Dr Rebecca Gomperts. The image contained instructions for inducing an abortion using Misoprostol. Gomperts was locked out of her account for two days after re-posting the image, but Facebook subsequently apologized and reinstated both the image and her account. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. With nearly 2bn users, the social media site plays a crucial role in disseminating news and information around the world. But Facebook has struggled to meet competing demands to allow for the free flow of information while cracking down on graphic material (such as the live-streamed murder of a baby in Thailand in April). In 2016, the company faced international condemnation over its decision to censor the iconic Vietnam War photograph of a naked girl fleeing a Napalm attack. Facebook subsequently altered its policy to allow for editorial judgments about newsworthiness. On 3 May, amid criticism over its handling of graphic videos, Facebook announced that it would hire 3,000 more content reviewers. Such content reviewers are tasked with applying the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards\u201d, often with uneven results. Facebook\u2019s has faced particular difficulty enforcing its rules for \u201cregulated goods\u201d \u2013 prescription drugs, marijuana, firearms, and ammunition. The company bars \u201cattempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or trade\u201d such items, but has struggled to halt gun sales. The company has cracked down aggressively on pages related to legal medical marijuana, however. In 2015, the site temporarily banned business publication Crain\u2019s for promoting a cover story about medical marijuana. Update: On Friday, Facebook apologized for the page deletion, saying that it had been made \u201cin error\u201d and the page had been restored. \u201cFacebook is a place for people and organisations to campaign for the things that matter to them, and Women on Web is an example of that,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe apologise for this and for any inconvenience caused.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
