Everton top Group H going into Thursday\u2019s return meeting with Lille on Merseyside having picked up important points in France and Krasnodar following an opening win over Wolfsburg. Sylvain Distin is expected to return to central defence with Antol\u00edn Alcaraz facing between six and 12 weeks out with a dislocated shoulder. The length of the Paraguayan\u2019s absence will be determined by whether he requires surgery. Mart\u00ednez has not shied from his ambition to win the Europa League, a prize with the bonus of a Champions League place from this season, and Baines admits qualification from a challenging group is not the limit of Everton\u2019s aims this season. The 29-year-old said: \u201cEurope is an added incentive for all of us. We all want to be part of something bigger and go on to that next level. We want to bring that next level to the football club and that is the motivation. That is what we are all working towards. We want Champions League football and silverware. We don\u2019t just want to do well, we want to create special memories. These European nights are special at the moment, the support we have on the road at places like Lille is just unbelievable, but we\u2019d like to excite the supporters even more if we can. We all want to play at the top level and share those moments with the fans as well.\u201d Everton and Lille played a goalless draw a fortnight ago but Baines believes his manager\u2019s style, plus long-term planning behind the scenes at Goodison, have equipped the club for more than Europa League football. He explained: \u201cWe are trying to develop our style into a way that isn\u2019t limited, so that there\u2019s no ceiling if we continue to improve on what we do, and we know we have still got to do that. It\u2019s the style the top teams will also be playing and it would be well suited to the Champions League if we go on to that level of football. \u201cWe have got a really good young group of players here now as well. I am part of the senior group if you like, with Phil Jagielka, Tim Howard, Leon Osman and Tony Hibbert, and there is also a secondary core group now of Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley, John Stones and James McCarthy who are all key players in the squad and are the real future now. It is part of the senior group\u2019s job and responsibility to help them move forward because they are the future. Me staying, then Seamus, Ross and Stonesy, who have all signed long-term contracts as well, is a real sign of where the club is at. They are all top players and the future of this football club. That is why we are heading in the right direction.\u201d Everton Probable 4-2-3-1 Howard; Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines; Besic, Barry; McGeady, Barkley, Pienaar; Lukaku."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
