More than 200,000 Britons emigrated during 2006, taking the number who have left the country between 1997 and 2006 to 1.97 million. Jill Rutter, senior research fellow in the migration team at the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the figures showed the biggest emigration wave from Britain in absolute numbers, although a larger proportion of the population left during the 1930s and in the middle of the 19th century. Many of the latest wave are Britons who have retired abroad, although only just over 6% of Britons leaving the country were over retirement age. The most popular destination was Australia. The institute, a centre-left thinktank, has estimated that there are more than 5.5 million British citizens living abroad. Another 1.58 million foreign nationals resident in Britain left during the same decade. Some of the Britons who left were foreigners who came to Britain, obtained British citizenship and later left. The outflow has been balanced by 3.9 million foreigners who arrived over the decade, including more than 500,000 in 2006. \"This is the numerically highest emigration ever,\" said Rutter. \"There are three reasons for it. First of all, prosperity, which means you have more lifestyle emigrants, early retirees who move to Spain or whatever. \"Second, there is the globalisation of international business, which means there are many more Brits working abroad, and people from minority-ethnic communities who had immigrated to the UK returning home. \"And thirdly, many of the Brits who leave the UK are from minority-ethnic communities who have previously immigrated to the UK, worked here for a time and now they're leaving.\" Other figures published yesterday showed the total number of eastern Europeans whose countries joined the EU in 2004 and who have applied to work in Britain has topped 800,000. The number of people granted British citizenship reached record levels last year, according to Home Office figures. The statistics revealed that 164,635 foreign nationals became British, up 7% on the previous 12 months. The number of new British citizens outstripped the previous record of 161,700 in 2005, a peak which was attributed to a rush of applications before the introduction of new citizenship requirements. The Home Office said the latest increase was partly the result of greater productivity, reducing the backlog of applications. New citizens from African countries accounted for 31% of the total, while the Indian subcontinent produced 15% of new Britons and the rest of Asia 22%. Nationalities accounting for the largest number of new British citizens were Indian with 14,490, Filipino (10,840), and Afghan (10,555), South African (8,150) and Pakistani (8,140). Afghans were the fastest-growing group with a 211% rise on the previous year. Home Office figures show a 16% rise in asylum applications in the first three months of this year, to 6,595, compared with the same period in 2007. The number of failed asylum seekers deported from January to March was down 13% to 2,805. But the total number of people removed was up 12% to 16,760."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
