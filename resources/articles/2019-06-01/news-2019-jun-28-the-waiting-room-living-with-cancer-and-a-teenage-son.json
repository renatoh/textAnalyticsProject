Shot on an iPhone X, Victoria filmed her time in waiting rooms, surgery and chemotherapy. The Waiting Room is an unflinching portrait of the blood, sweat and tears of cancer treatment. Victoria makes visible the often invisible sickness, fatigue, tears and hair loss. At home, she filmed with her teenage son as they came to terms with how single-parent family life was transformed by a year of living with cancer. Victoria documents cancer from a patient\u2019s point of view, exploring what we can and what we can\u2019t control when our bodies fail us. \u201cWe have made cancer our enemy, a dark force to be fought by a relentlessly upbeat attitude,\u201d she says. The Waiting Room is the antidote to what she perceives as the \u201ctyranny of positive thinking. It challenges the cultural myths that surround the disease and puts the language of illness under the microscope. Victoria\u2019s previous short documentary, Missed Call, also made using mobile phones, won a Bafta for best short-form programme in May. She is a writer, artist and director who has been experimenting with the frontiers of documentary and creative technology for the last two decades. She wrote and directed Smart Hearts, Channel 4\u2019s first interactive documentary series in 1999, in which webcams streamed live from the subjects\u2019 homes for over 18 months. She also wrote and directed TEXT ME in 2014, an award winning interactive arts project which created an evolving and living archive in which users are encouraged to collect, curate and share stories from their digital past. The Waiting Room is accompanied by a VR Project that delves even deeper into the experience of living with cancer. Coming up: Crannog Although Alexis has a life-threatening disease, she provides palliative care for animals. Crannog follows Alexis as she tirelessly tries to nurse a neglected sheep back to health. A quiet reflection on kindness in the face of death, the film intimately explores the fragility and strength that comes from dedicating your life to the care of others. Out in July Guardian documentaries screening We return to Bertha Dochouse on 17 July for a series of our films including Q&amp;As with some of the filmmakers.
