Not a bit of it. Top of the agenda for an all-girls weekend in Italy is shopping at the discount designer warehouses of Gucci, Prada and other high fashion names. Until now, finding these fashion treasure houses, built on industrial estates in the Tuscan countryside, has meant hiring a car, spending a small fortune on taxis or using the bus service which, in that Italian way of things, is often on strike or just plain late. But a new company called HushHush Traveller is offering fully escorted shopping weekends from the UK which allow women hours and hours of retail therapy. The trips are already proving popular for hen parties and birthday treats. 'I wouldn't say I was an obsessive shopper but the chance to come to Italy and go shopping without the family is my idea of heaven,' says 33-year-old Caroline Forman, a recruitment manager with an 18-month-old daughter. 'I can do culture with my husband.' She's one of 10 women on this shopping trip with an age range of early twenties to sixties. Within a couple of hours of their plane touching down at Pisa airport, the women are already at The Mall, the discount designer warehouse some 40 kilometres outside Florence. Some of them literally break into a run at the sight of all those names - Gucci, Giorgio Armani, Bottega Veneta and Marni. Three hours of shopping in the 'street' of a dozen shops should be enough, but as the group heads back by minibus to book into hotels in Florence, the general opinion is that another hour would have been better. 'I meant to go back to Valentino,' wails one. Strangely, there has been no mad spending spree, although the women are pleased with their haul, which includes Sergio Rossi shoes and Gucci handbags. It turns out that everyone is keeping themselves - and their credit cards - in check for the real shopping experience the following day at the Prada warehouse, hallowed ground for bargain-hunters. Dinner is a communal affair in a restaurant in Florence, and the wine flows. One woman describes how her first husband died, leaving her a widow in her thirties. She didn't believe she would ever be happy again, but then she met someone new and they now have a two-year-old daughter. There's a collective 'aaah' from the table. Roll-call the next day is for 9am, and it's back on the motorway to Levanella, a 40-minute drive south of Florence. This is Space, home to discounted Prada, Miu Miu, Jil Sander and Helmut Lang. 'Elbows out, girls!' jokes one of the group as the doors swing open. The morning is spent in Prada heaven, with shoes being judged the best buy at half price or better. Kay Smith, on holiday from Australia, buys seven pairs to add to her collection of 200 at home. By late morning carrier bags filled with clothes, shoes, sunglasses, scarves, handbags and raincoats are piled high in the minibus - the company has thoughtfully provided named luggage labels to differentiate everyone's purchases. Then it's on to Dolce &amp; Gabbana, which turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, largely because stock is low and prices seem expensive. For Caroline and her friend Sarah Coole from Wimbledon, it has been their first experience of outlet shopping. 'Being able to go to so many designers in a manageable time frame has been great. It's completely different to shopping on a Saturday afternoon,' says Caroline. 'I liked the fact that it was easy - that you're picked up from the airport and you don't have to think about anything. It's been a really relaxed pace.' Sarah says she liked the communal shopping experience: 'Getting excited about each other's bargains - I really enjoyed that. Prada was so big it was almost overwhelming, so it was nice not to be on your own,' she says. Both women agreed they got bargains - some of the things they bought were half-price - but the enjoyable bit was simply shopping somewhere new. The day ends back in Florence where the women tour the markets and boutiques and raid Zara, where the clothes cost less than in the UK. Everyone wants to stick together again for dinner, and the evening ends in the bar of Sir Rocco Forte's Hotel Savoy with glasses of champagne, mojitas and martinis. By 1am everyone is happily sozzled. It's been a bit of an AbFab weekend - and yes, they can do culture another time.
