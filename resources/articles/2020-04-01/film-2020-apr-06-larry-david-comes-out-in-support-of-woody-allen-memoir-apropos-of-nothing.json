Allen\u2019s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, who has alleged the film-maker sexually assaulted her in 1992, thanked Hachette\u2019s employees on social media, saying: \u201cI\u2019m in awe and so very grateful.\u201d Woody Allen has been the subject of police investigations in respect of these allegations but has never been charged. The New York Department of Social Services said at the time of its investigation \u201cthat there was no credible evidence\u201d to support the allegation. David starred in Allen\u2019s 2009 comedy Whatever Works, and had small roles in previous Allen films: Radio Days and the Oedipus Wrecks segment of the three-part New York Stories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
