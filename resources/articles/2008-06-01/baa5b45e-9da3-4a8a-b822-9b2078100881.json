She was one of the most widely respected professional officials that the National Union of Students ever had, and the main reason why it had an influence disproportionate to its size. In 1975, after 24 years at the NUS, she was poached by Labour's new education secretary, Fred Mulley. She was his adviser, and then adviser to his successor, Shirley Williams, until Labour lost power in 1979. An authoritative figure, she became used to having her opinion sought by politicians, civil servants and journalists. Every year she compiled the NUS grants claim, and her research and advocacy were the key factors in keeping the level of grant high enough for students to live on. She was also universally liked. Slim, elegant, thoughtful and kind, she was economical with words, which she used precisely, alighting on exactly the word she wanted like a discriminating bird on a twig. Born Stella Draycott in Sheffield, she was the daughter of teachers; her father had won one of the first state scholarships to Sheffield University. She attended High Storrs grammar school, which she loved. At St Hugh's College, Oxford, she studied German and French, and began what became a lifelong involvement with the NUS: in 1946 she was an NUS delegate to the founding conference of the International Union of Students in Prague. IUS become the Soviet-bloc student international, later confronted by a western-bloc international in the cold war years, but Stella and her colleagues were filled with optimism about the postwar era. She joined the Communist party on her return, but left it in April 1948. For 18 months she worked for a Czech jewellery firm in London, then took a secretarial course, learning shorthand, which she deployed with merciless politeness in later negotiations with ministers. John Randall, who was the NUS president 1973-75, recalled her flicking back through her notebook and saying: \"That's not what you told us two years ago.\" In 1951, she married and went to work for the NUS, first in its travel department, then in education and welfare, dealing with grants and local education authorities, conducting surveys of hall fees, and running the campaign for mandatory student grants, which triumphed when the government introduced them in 1962. That year Stella married her second husband, Philip Greenall. Student grants were an NUS achievement, and the key player was Stella. She was also central to the successful campaign for three-year training courses for teachers. Her personality helped ensure that the NUS was seen as an equal among the then powerful education unions, yet she always deferred to whoever was elected as the president of the day. The broadcaster Alastair Stewart, who was NUS vice president 1974-76, said: \"She gave several generations the confidence to think, lead, write and broadcast ... In letting us commit the occasional error she helped make us, though I don't think she'd ever have let us make a really big mistake.\" At first she worked on her own, but by the time she left the NUS in 1975 she headed an education and welfare department with a staff of 35. When Mulley moved from education to defence, he wanted to take her with him, but she accepted a pressing invitation from Williams to stay at education. Her intention had been to retire early, as Philip was some years older than her. Sadly, he died in 1979, the year that Stella's career in government came to a natural end, when Labour lost the election. She sold their collections of 17th and 18th-century traders' tokens and gave Philip's treasured collection of 900 Venetian coins to the British Museum, where she did volunteer cataloguing work. In 1998 she cancelled her standing order to the Labour party: \"We have elected a monster, worse than anything Thatcher ever attempted.\" On her 80th birthday, the NUS held a party for her. Many old colleagues were there, but former presidents Jack Straw and Charles Clarke sent affectionate and admiring messages instead: perhaps they knew how deeply shocked she had been that tuition fees had been introduced by a Labour government. In a graceful and almost self-effacing speech, she congratulated the NUS and its then president Gemma Tumelty on mobilising against tuition fees. She added that the NUS was \"a self-selecting group of people, the sort of people who put their hands up and say, yes, I'll do that, I'll get involved in changing things.\" That is what she did all her life; she is survived by her two nephews, Nicholas and Stuart Draycott. \u00b7 Stella Margaret Greenall, education activist and government adviser, born October 8 1926; died June 18 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
