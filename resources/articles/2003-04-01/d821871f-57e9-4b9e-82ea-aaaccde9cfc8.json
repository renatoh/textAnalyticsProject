Official Audit Bureau of Circulation figures published at 5pm today confirm what the Mirror has been dreading - its decision to convert to a \"serious\" intelligent read, big on foreign and war news on small on celebrity trivia, has been a turn-off for readers. The March sales figures, although widely predicted, will come as a huge blow to the paper and go down as a milestone in tabloid newspaper history. ABC figures shows 91,693 fewer readers are buying the paper compared with this time last year, leaving the Mirror with an overall circulation of 1,997,846. Sources say were it not for the higher circulation of the Saturday edition, the Mirror's figures would by much lower. In a further psychological blow to the Mirror, the Sun's fervently gung-ho coverage of the war in Iraq helped it add 141,636 readers year on year, a rise of 4.19%. The Daily Mail, which powered past the Daily Mirror in terms of circulation four years ago, has also shown a slight increase despite its sceptical stance on the war. It is up 1% to 2.342 million copies. Editor Piers Morgan's controversial anti-war stance has been widely blamed for the drop - down 4.4% on March 2002 - but it has only hastened the inevitable. Once the world's biggest selling newspaper, the Mirror's circulation has gradually eroded since the 60s, when it reached a high of more than 5 million. Today's figures represent the latest in a series of blows for the Mirror, which clung on to its position as Britain's second most popular daily newspaper until just four-and-a-half years ago, when it was finally overtaken by the Mail. Its decline began when the Mirror's Hugh Cudlipp sold the Sun to Rupert Murdoch in 1969. Within nine years the Sun - under the towering leadership of Mr Murdoch and a succession of editors, including the legendary Kelvin MacKenzie - had overtaken its one-time stablemate. By the mid-80s sales were steady at around 3.5 million, not far off the Sun's 4 million figure. But in the following decade a million readers gradually drifted away, leaving it vulnerable to the burgeoning Mail. A \u00a316m relaunch in the mid-90s, when Morgan took the helm and the paper was dubbed \"A Mirror for the millennium\", went some way towards stopping the decline. But by 1998 circulation had plummeted to just 2.3 million copies and a concerted campaign by the Mail to win over readers helped the mid-market paper overtake the Mirror. Morgan pledged to win back lost ground but since then sales of the Mirror have continued to fall despite a \u00a320m revamp last year. After the September 11 terrorist attacks Morgan pledged to adopt a more serious news agenda, ditched the \"tacky\" red masthead, reinstating the word \"Daily\" to the paper's title and hiring columnists such as John Pilger and Christopher Hitchens. Morgan won a huge publicity coup for the move but sales have continued to drop. The paper's circulation declined by about 3% in the last six months of 2002, despite cover price cuts when the tabloid entered into a bitter price war with the Sun. The price battle cost Trinity Mirror \u00a321.8m over the last year but by January 2003 circulation had fallen by more than 3% (excluding bulks) to just over 2 million. One of the first things new chief executive Sly Bailey did after taking the reins at Trinity Mirror was to declare an end to price cutting, which has benefited the Sun more than the Mirror. Yesterday she said that Morgan's job was \"safe\" pointing out \"the entire market had suffered throughout the war\". She added: \"This is a TV war, not a newspaper war.\" Morgan has now toned down his anti-war stance - it has been less obvious on the paper's front page for the past few days - and admitted it could have been to blame for the drop. \"Do I think our anti-war line is to blame for any of the drop? Possibly a bit among our older readers who think it's unpatriotic to continue criticising the war now it's started,\" Morgan said. Paradoxically, the circulation of the main anti-war broadsheet, the Guardian, rose last month - up 3.9% to 396,849 copies. However, the Independent, which regulary carried reports from the fervently anti-war reporter Robert Fisk on its front page, lost readers, slipping 1.13% to 191,826 copies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
