The truth is, so had the rest of us. There have been few more painful episodes in sport \u2013 including for viewers who retain even an ounce of compassion \u2013 than Spieth\u2019s late capitulation at the 2016 Masters. For all the analysis and introspection that followed, one thing has been missing: Spieth placing himself firmly in position to win another major championship. How would he handle it? Would glory matter more than previously? Did that Georgian affair irrevocably damage Spieth\u2019s ability to close out on the big stage? The broader picture, of a curious run involving seven successive first-time major champions, is that golf would surely have benefited from this brilliant young Texan endorsing earlier flirtation with greatness by dominating his sport. Shortly after 1pm on this, the opening round of the 146th Open Championship, Spieth sat atop the leaderboard once more. There are 54 holes to play yet it is hardly unnatural to fast forward to Sunday, to the death throes of this event, and the tantalising prospect of Spieth exorcising some Augusta demons. Or, dare one suggest it, otherwise. The 23-year-old has an itch to scratch in this major, too, having fallen just a shot outside a play-off position in the Open of 2015. Spieth\u2019s standards are high. His analysis of this Open start of 65 was therefore telling. \u201cEverything was strong,\u201d he said. \u201cI give it a nine out of 10 across the board for everything: tee balls, ball-striking, short game and putting. So things are in check. It\u2019s just about keeping it consistent. \u201cThis round could be a lot more significant in three days\u2019 time than I would consider it right now. I\u2019d call it a top five, probably, major round that I\u2019ve played. There are scores that I\u2019ve shot that were closer to par that were better given what I needed to do. But I couldn\u2019t have done much better today.\u201d By the conclusion of day one, Spieth had been joined at five under par by his compatriots Brooks Koepka and Matt Kuchar. It would be unwise to discount Koepka in particular from this Open equation, given his terrific performance last month when claiming the US equivalent. It is hardly an insult to Koepka to suggest his obvious refusal to overanalyse \u2013 or even analyse \u2013 on the golf course carries huge benefit. There were indications that Spieth may have been building towards Birkdale. In his last professional act before the Open, he holed out from a bunker to win the Travelers Championship. Spieth\u2019s confidence was further endorsed by his decision to take a holiday thereafter. He landed on Merseyside not only refreshed but buoyed by the tangible reward his performances earlier in 2017 threatened rather than promised. Spieth was wise enough to point out he probably had to make hay while the sun, literally, shone. Excellent conditions on Thursday, aside from an early morning spell during which a squall conjured memories of 2008 here, are likely to be offset by wind and rain throughout day two. \u201cI thought today\u2019s round was extremely important,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cGiven the forecast coming in, I thought you really needed to be in the red today.\u201d Two moments of Spieth magic on Thursday stood out. A chip to within tap-in distance of the 10th hole from dense rough was sublime. Even better followed on the 16th, where the two-times major champion produced an outstanding effort from a downhill lie in a greenside bunker to again permit a par save. Paul Casey\u2019s 66 leaves him in a perfect position for a serious run at the major win that has thus far eluded him. Casey will celebrate his 40th birthday on the Open\u2019s second day. The Englishman has that batch of first-time winners as a reference point should, and it seems unlikely, he require further incentive. \u201cThe Open has never been the major I\u2019ve fared the best at,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI seem to have struggled, apart from St Andrews in 2010. My results haven\u2019t been good but I feel really good about this week. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, maybe I\u2019m more in love with links golf than I was before. Certainly this course helps, I really like this course. I\u2019m not putting that much pressure on myself but very much wanting to win it.\u201d Ian Poulter, who could complete a golfing fairytale by progressing from final qualifying to the podium, signed for a 67. Justin Thomas sported a collar and tie for Thursday, the kind of move that would lead to ridicule if not backed up by a proper showing. Thomas duly matched Poulter\u2019s score, as did Richard Bland, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Charley Hoffman and Austin Connelly. Rory McIlroy was in a tailspin when five over par after only six holes. The Northern Irishman saved par from distance on the 8th in a moment that seemed to trigger an upturn in confidence. A 71 to start, in context, represented quite an achievement with McIlroy\u2019s body language alone notably positive during post-round media duties. It would be folly to discount him from the tournament at this juncture. If McIlroy did not have the heart or the ability to contend, there was ample opportunity to throw in the towel. The problem for McIlroy, and others, is Spieth\u2019s prominence. The sense of familiarity was, for once, a welcome one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
