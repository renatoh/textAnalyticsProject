The Turkey captain, Emre Belozoglu, also had a dishwashing brush thrust towards his face as he spoke outside Keflavik airport about his team\u2019s treatment. \u201cWe were searched more than once which was unnecessary, and we were told to wait until now,\u201d he said. The vice-captain, Burak Yilmaz, was much angrier. \u201cWhat they have done is disrespectful and rude,\u201d he told Turkish TV reporters waiting outside. \u201cWe have been waiting here for three hours. They took everyone\u2019s bags and even everyone\u2019s cosmetics. They searched it again and again. We flew for six and a half hours and we\u2019ve waited for three hours.\u201d Turkey\u2019s team, fresh from its defeat of world champions France on Saturday, flew into Keflavik airport on Monday morning before their match against Iceland on Tuesday. Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said action will be taken. \u201cThe disrespect shown to our national team in Iceland is unacceptable and what is necessary will be done,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cOur national team will give the best response on the field.\u201d The complaint was echoed by foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the spokesman of Erdogan\u2019s ruling AK party and other officials. Turkey\u2019s embassy in Oslo sent a diplomatic note to Iceland\u2019s government protesting at the \u201cdisrespect\u201d shown to the team. There was no immediate comment from Iceland\u2019s government or foreign ministry. Omar Smarason, head of media and marketing at the Football Association of Iceland, said all passengers from \u201cnon-certified\u201d airports received similar checks. Iceland\u2019s players went through the same procedure when they arrived home from Turkey\u2019s Konya airport five years ago, he added. The man with the brush was shown on Turkish TV filming himself with a mobile device as he approached the players with his mock microphone. Turkish social media users responded with indignation, and graphics showing the Icelandic flag with a brush taking the place of the vertical bar of its red cross. The hashtag #TurksAreComingForIceland trended on Twitter in Turkey. Turkey currently lead their Euro 2020 qualifying Group H, having shocked France with a 2-0 win in Konya on Saturday, followed by France then Iceland, who beat Albania 1-0 at home on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
