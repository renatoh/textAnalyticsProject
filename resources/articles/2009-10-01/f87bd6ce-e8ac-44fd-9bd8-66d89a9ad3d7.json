Comcast is in discussions with General Electric, which owns 80% of NBC, about joint ownership of the business, which is valued by analysts at $30bn-$35bn. The transaction would shake up the US media industry and could breathe fresh life into NBC, which has struggled with cutbacks and dwindling ratings. News of the negotiations leaked on to the financial markets during a turbulent day for Wall Street, which saw stocks take their biggest tumble since early July, depressed by gloomy manufacturing figures, sparking nerves that a long predicted \"correction\" could be under way. \"Fear is still very fresh in people's mindsand the magnitude of the potential disaster that we had last September through March, I think still has investors pretty skittish,\" said Darell Krasnoff, managing director of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles. A Hollywood entertainment website, The Wrap, sparked excitement on deal-hungry trading floors by reporting that Comcast had agreed to buy NBC for $35bn. Comcast issued a statement describing this as \"inaccurate\", but a source close to the situation later revealed that negotiations towards a tie-up were under way. Under the arrangement being discussed, NBC Universal would be spun off into a standalone company, with Comcast owning 51% and GE holding 49%. There will be a window of opportunity for new ownership between mid-November and mid-December, when France's Vivendi, which presently has 20% of NBC, has an option to sell up. Comcast provides cable television to 24 million subscribers and has made little secret of its ambition to control more of the content it distributes. But Craig Moffett, an analyst at stockbroker Sanford Bernstein, said shareholders would be sceptical: \"A deal will play to investors' worst fears about Comcast's capital allocation.\" NBC's portfolio of businesses includes the Hollywood film studio Universal Pictures, responsible for recent releases such as Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, the Jennifer Aniston romance Love Happens and Sacha Baron Cohen's caustic comedy Br\u00fcno. The company has movie-related theme parks in Florida, California and Japan. On television, its channels include Bravo, CNBC and SciFi. But its core NBC network has been faring poorly in the US, with old hits such as ER, Seinfeld and Frasier fading into memory. Investors have been pressing GE to offload the company, viewed as non-core to the industrial conglomerate. Shares in GE, a bellwether for US stocks, dropped by 2.7% during a day on which falling stocks outnumbered risers by five to one. An index of manufacturing activity compiled by the Institute for Supply Management dropped from 52.9 to 52.6 in August, and weekly US jobless claims rose sharply. Meanwhile, Detroit's struggling carmakers revealed sharp drops in monthly sales as the US government's \"cash for clunkers\" subsidy scheme ended. General Motors suffered a 45% year-on-year plunge in sales during September, Chrysler fell by 42% and Ford's sales fell by 5%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
