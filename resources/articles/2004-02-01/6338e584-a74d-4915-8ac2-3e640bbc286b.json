The government finally received some good news from universities as the latest figures from the third annual higher education business interaction survey showed a steep rise in the amount of money generated by university \"spin-off\" companies. Turnover from universities' commercial enterprises increased last year from \u00a3212m to \u00a3289m, and the number of people employed by spin-offs increased from 10,500 to 12,000. While there was a small drop in the number of new enterprises created, income from intellectual property rights increased 83% from \u00a318m to \u00a333m, and the number of new patents filed by universities rose by 8%. Ministers welcomed the findings. Lord Sainsbury, science and innovation minister said: \"UK Universities have risen to the challenge of transferring their knowledge into industry and are becoming increasingly entrepreneurial. Their pioneering work is being turned into practical applications and is making a valuable contribution to the economy and society.\" The chancellor Gordon Brown will be particularly pleased by the figures as he has set increasing the business potential of universities as one of his key goals. After commissioning former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert to review the way universities and businesses worked together, he set up a \u00a3187m fund to promote collaborations between the two areas. Commenting on the figures today Mr Lambert said: \"I am pleased to see that the amount of interaction between business and universities has continued to increase. In conducting my review, I found many good practice examples of business-university collaborations that were bringing real benefits to business, universities and to the wider economy.\" Higher education minister Alan Johnson said that the extra funding should produce even better results: \"I am confident that the increased resources we are providing through the higher education innovation fund will go a long way in boosting and increasing the success already recorded in this area.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
