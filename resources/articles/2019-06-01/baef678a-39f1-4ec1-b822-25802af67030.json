Gen Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, Bolsonaro\u2019s secretary of government, had repeatedly locked horns with the president\u2019s crotchety US-based guru, Olavo de Carvalho, and was reportedly relieved of his duties on Thursday afternoon. The move, which sent shockwaves through Brazilian politics, came as Bolsonaro finally broke an almost four-day silence over a still unfolding scandal involving his justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro. Moro is facing calls for his resignation after a series of politically explosive leaks published by the Intercept suggested he colluded with prosecutors in order to jail Bolsonaro\u2019s key rival in last year\u2019s presidential election, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Polls suggested Lula would have defeated Bolsonaro had he been able to run. Bolsonaro loyalists and Olavo de Carvalho devotees celebrated the defenestration of Santos Cruz, one of the key players in what is seen as a comparatively moderate military faction with the administration. \u201cSantos Cruz has been relieved of his duties. The drinks are on me,\u201d tweeted the Bolsonarian blogger Allan dos Santos. But political observers voiced shock and concern that one of the more temperate characters around Brazil\u2019s far-right leader had been forced out. Brian Winter, a Brazil specialist and the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said: \u201cIt is very sudden, it is very unexpected, and it comes at a time when the pragmatic voices seemed to be ascendant in the government. This is one of the most pragmatic voices in the government who can be fired.\u201d Winter said it was unclear whether Santos Cruz\u2019s demise was the result of a clash with the president, or friction with Bolsonaro\u2019s Olavo de Carvalho-supporting sons, Eduardo and Carlos, who have been \u201cbaying for his head publicly and behind the scenes\u201d for weeks. The Rio broadsheet O Globo said the sacking was the result of \u201ca lack of political and ideological alignment\u201d. Santos Cruz became embroiled in a public feud with Olavo de Carvalho in March, with the latter launching a succession of foul-mouthed and often infantile Twitter attacks. \u201cWatch your mouth, you shit,\u201d Carvalho tweeted at one point. On another occasion he branded Santos Cruz \u201ca pompous turd\u201d. Santos Cruz hit back more subtly, using one interview to warn of the danger \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201cfanaticism\u201d posed to Bolsonaro\u2019s government and Brazil. Santos Cruz\u2019s dismissal came shortly after Bolsonaro offered his backing to another key minister, S\u00e9rgio Moro, who has come under fire this week following the Intercept\u2019s revelations. \u201cWhat he did is priceless. He is part of Brazilian history,\u201d Bolsonaro said in reference to the sprawling Car Wash anti-corruption investigation for which Moro became famous. However, the Intercept\u2019s editors have vowed to release more compromising material from what they call a \u201cvast trove\u201d of secret documents, leaving Brazil\u2019s political class bracing for further turbulence. Sergio Pra\u00e7a, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation University, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that this is only the beginning and things can change quickly. We don\u2019t know what more is coming or when.\u201d Winter said the political upheaval came after Bolsonaro\u2019s government \u201cappeared to have found some kind of relative footing over the last month or so\u201d. \u201cIt looked like they were starting to pull it together, relatively speaking. Guess what? The drama is back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
