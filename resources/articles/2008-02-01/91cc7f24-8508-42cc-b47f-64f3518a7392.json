On your current edition on Guardian Music Weekly, the Young Knives join us in the studio to discuss the intricacies of being in their band. The boys from Ashby-de-la-Zouch claim they're not \"toff rock\", as some would put it, nor are they particularly political. However, Henry Dartnall, Thomas Dartnall and Oliver Askew do list Steely Dan and Fairport Convention as among the bands who influenced their new album, Superabundance, and they do have some strong things to say about Jeremy Kyle. Another artist who claims to be influenced by folk music is Canadian rapper Cadence Weapon. Otherwise known as Rollie Pemberton, the one-time music critic (yes, really!) talks to Paul Macinnes about why he likes to rap over dance beats and how Bob Dylan is \"the best rapper\" around. And somewhere in the middle, Guardian music writer Paul Lester, he of New Band of the Day fame, joined Paul and Rosie to review new dongles (singles + downloads= dongles, guys) by REM, Les Savy Fav and the Clik Clik.
