The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned of the approaching milestone as new cases reached almost every country and territory across the world. \u201cAs we enter the fourth month since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic I\u2019m deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cOver the past five weeks, we have witnessed a near exponential growth in the number of new cases, reaching almost every country. \u201cThe number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week. In the next few days we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths.\u201d The total number of cases on Thursday was just below 936,000 with more than 47,000 deaths. On Wednesday evening, Donald Trump warned of \u201cdifficult days\u201d for the US, saying: \u201cWe are going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific.\u201d He again questioned China\u2019s reported numbers on the virus: \u201cThe numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side \u2013 and I am being nice when I say that \u2013 relative to what we witnessed and what was reported.\u201d The comments followed a Bloomberg news story that said a classified US intelligence report had concluded that China had under-reported the total cases and deaths it had suffered. On Wednesday \u2013 the last day of available figures \u2013 China reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths. Trump\u2019s warning came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly asked US defence agencies for 100,000 body bags, for use by civilian authorities. The White House has previously said deaths could reach 240,000. The United States has reported 213,000 confirmed cases \u2013 more than 20% of cases globally. Their death toll stands at 5,119. The rapid growth in the number of infections has overwhelmed hospitals in many cities. A week ago the US Centers for Disease Control said there were 85,000 cases. That means recorded cases have grown by two and a half times in a week, and up from 15,219 two weeks ago. In Europe, the three worst-affected countries \u2013 Italy Spain and Germany \u2013 represent just under a third of the confirmed cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Their combined death tolls make up 44% of fatalities worldwide. Spain hit another grim milestone on Thursday, as the number of deaths passed 10,000 and yet another record single-day death toll of 950 was recorded. However, while the total number of cases in the country rose to 110,238, the spread of the disease appears to be continuing to slow during the so-called \u201cstabilisation phase\u201d. In Italy there is growing concern over social unrest, three weeks into its lockdown. Tensions in some of the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia have mounted, as people in some areas began to run out of food and money. Meanwhile Russia posted its largest single-day rise in identified cases. Officials said they had identified 771 new cases in the past day, a 28% rise from the previous day. Nearly 600 of the new cases were in Moscow, which has been the Russian city hit hardest by the crisis, with 2,475 confirmed cases. So far, 30 people have died, official statistics report. Other coronavirus developments included: Trump admitted his government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment was nearly exhausted because of the extraordinary demands of the coronavirus pandemic, as the US reported 884 deaths in one day. He also said the US \u201chad to help\u201d the two coronavirus-stricken cruise liners approaching Florida. British Airways is expected to announce the suspension of 36,000 staff, according to the BBC. Brazil confirmed its first indigenous case of Covid-19, a 20-year-old woman deep in the Amazon rainforest. Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines president, urged police to kill those violating virus lockdown measures. \u201cIf there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead,\u201d he said. His threat follows the arrest of 21 people who had apparently taken to the streets to demand help. South Korea reported 89 new coronavirus cases, slightly lower than the 100-case average over the last three weeks, bringing the country\u2019s total to 9,976. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is returning to self-isolation for another six days after his health minister was diagnosed with coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
