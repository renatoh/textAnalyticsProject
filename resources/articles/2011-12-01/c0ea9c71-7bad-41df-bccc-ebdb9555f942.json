City's manager remains adamant that a spat captured by photographers will have no bearing on the title race, as his side prepare to face Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. \"For me this is not an important factor for team spirit,\" Mancini said. \"It is only important for five minutes and then, afterwards, it is finished.\" Even so, with his players having lost their first Premier League game of the season at Chelsea last Monday, he could do without any divisions within the squad. \"It was boxing; it was nothing special,\" reiterated an apparently unperturbed Mancini, who, in the past, has gone to sometimes extraordinary lengths to support his compatriot Balotelli through a series of scrapes. \"This can happen,\" he added The Italy striker's knack of serving as a magnet for controversy has resulted in Balotelli wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the message \"Why always me?\". Publicly at least, Mancini continues to see the funny side of the player's antics. \"I asked him: 'Why always you?'\" he said. \"Mario replied it was because Micah Richards did not pass the ball to him. It was really stupid but it was finished after 10 minutes.\" Nonetheless, a long-running series of incidents involving Balotelli shows little sign of abating. \"It has happened with Mario four times this year,\" Mancini conceded, before recalling the night that Balotelli and friends set the forward's house on fire while lobbing fireworks out of a bathroom window. \"Mario is the king for this. Now, of course, we are near Christmas and there is a real danger with him and fireworks. It is better for him to stay in his hotel.\" While Balotelli is temporarily domiciled in a five-star property as that fire damage is repaired, his impressive form ranks as a major reason why City remain title favourites. This perhaps explains Mancini's willingness to empathise with his enfant terrible. Asked whether he had ever been involved in a training-ground bust-up during his Serie A days, the Italian answered in the affirmative. \"Always,\" he said. \"Once with Trevor Francis, once with Liam Brady, but these stupid things happen. And they happen in every team; maybe not every week but often. Mario and Micah are like twins, they are very good friends.\" Samir Nasri, City's \u00a325m former Arsenal midfielder, is a very good footballer but one who has exerted far less bearing on his new team's rise to the top of the Premier League than might have been expected. Indeed, lately Nasri has been omitted from City's biggest games, with his form apparently leaving his manager torn between frustration, awareness of a need for patience and a sense that Nasri has not coped overly well with new on-field responsibilities. \"Samir is a champion, he's a top, top player,\" said Mancini, whose second anniversary as City's manager falls on Monday. \"He can do more but when you change teams you can have a problem. Samir didn't play against Chelsea, he didn't play against Manchester United. I would like him to play better because, in my opinion, he is a really top player. Maybe his confidence is not very good but, if he plays Sunday, he has a chance to show what he can do.\" Doing so is invested with additional importance, in that Nasri may be required to replace Yaya Tour\u00e9 when City's influential Ivorian midfielder departs shortly for the Africa Cup of Nations. It promises to be a testing time and Mancini acknowledged as much. \"If Yaya and Kolo Tour\u00e9 come back from Africa and we are still top then we will win the title,\" he said. Accordingly, Nasri and his manager have discussed the player's slow progress. \"We've talked; I think Samir has time to show what he is capable of,\" Mancini said. \"I hope Samir can play more games at a higher level. A top player should show responsibility.\" Mancini accepts that, to remain in charge of City he must keep winning trophies but admires Arsenal's loyalty to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger after six years without silverware. \"Surviving that would be impossible for me here and it would be impossible in Italy,\" he said. \"In the next six years we will win a lot of trophies but Wenger is still a great manager because of the way his teams play football. Sometimes, there are reasons why great managers can't win. Sometimes you get into a Champions League final but you have to play Barcelona and then you meet Manchester United and Chelsea when they are on top.\" Mancini recognises that even City have their vulnerabilities. \"What happened to us against Chelsea had to happen,\" he said, turning sanguine. \"Now we will see what happens on Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
