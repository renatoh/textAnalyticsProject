In the absence of a dominant No 10 at this World Cup, the Wallabies employed three playmakers in their 27-8 win against Georgia in their final Pool D game at Shizuoka Stadium \u2013 five-eighth Matt To\u2019omua, outside-centre James O\u2019Connor and full-back Kurtley Beale. Significantly, all three have played five-eighth for the Wallabies, although they have established themselves in other positions. And the three playmakers took it in turns to play at first receiver against Georgia until a groggy Beale left the field with a head knock in the 13th minute. When O\u2019Connor and Beale did not come into first receiver, they often popped up at second receiver, pushing the powerful midfielder Samu Kerevi further wide. Kerevi has been central to the Wallabies\u2019 gameplan, getting across the advantage line with strong ball carries, but the Wallabies seemed more interested in developing the combination between the three playmakers. It was a possible preview of how they intend to solve their five-eighth dilemma for their likely quarter-final against England, but did coach Michael Cheika and his co-selectors see enough in just 13 minutes to make a decision? When Beale departed the score was 0-0, the playmaking trio unable to unlock the stern Georgian defence. A clean break by To\u2019omua led to the Wallabies\u2019 first try, by half-back Nic White in the 22nd minute, but they only led 10-3 at half-time. It took a piece of individual brilliance by Marika Koroibete in the 59th minute to give the Wallabies some much-needed breathing space. Koroiebete picked up a loose ball and stepping off his right foot he beat three defenders in a mesmerising run to the try line. It was wonderful work by Koroibete, but not an example of the teamwork Cheika had been looking for. Interestingly, To\u2019omua kept the goal-kicking duties even though five-eighth Christian Lealiifano had come on to the field as a replacement just two minutes before Koroibete\u2019s try. Even though he only landed three out of five attempts against Georgia, To\u2019omua has the best goal-kicking percentage this year of any of the fly-half candidates and that could be decisive when the selectors finalise the team for England. With Lealiifano replacing the young wing Jordan Petaia, who had another strong performance, all the backs moved out one position wider, perhaps creating some confusion in defence, leading to Georgia\u2019s sole try to wing Sandro Todua in the 69th minute, which put the Lelos back in the game at 17-8. The Wallabies struggled to find rhythm and pace in their attack, but that may not have been the fault of their playmakers. Despite wet and windy conditions, they played with the ball in hand, eschewing any thoughts of tactical kicking, particularly in the first half. Before the game Cheika offered that kicking was not in Australia\u2019s nature, but the tactic to keep the ball in hand was more about honing the forwards for the big clash with the England pack in the quarter-final. However, as a result, in the slippery conditions against Georgia, the Wallabies coughed up the ball time and again in contact, stifling their continuity in attack. After demanding a more disciplined performance, Cheika would have been disappointed to see the Australians receive yet another yellow card for a head-high tackle. Isi Naisarani was sent to the sin-bin in the 34th minute after an illegal cleanout, while To\u2019omua had been penalised for a head-high tackle earlier in the game. It will be interesting to see whether Naisarani\u2019s indiscretion has any bearing on the selection of the Wallabies\u2019 back-row for the quarter-final. Back-rower David Pocock played strongly at openside flanker against Georgia and his \u201cPooper\u201d combination with the Wallabies captain, Michael Hooper, who was rested against Georgia, is likely to be reunited for the England game. This means Naisarani will compete with Jack Dempsey for the third position in the Wallabies back-row. Playing at blindside flanker Dempsey backed up his strong performance against Uruguay with another solid effort against Georgia. Dempsey scored his first Test try at the back of a rolling maul from a five metre lineout in the 74th minute. While not as powerful as Naisarani, Dempsey has superior footwork and ball-handling skills. At the very least, he has probably secured a place on the reserves bench. Cheika would have been fairly happy with the forwards\u2019 overall performance against Georgia. They held their own against one of the strongest scrummagers in Europe and eventually got on top in the lineout, although their ball running could have been more accurate. Young tight-head prop Taniela Tupou made a big impact off the bench against Georgia, putting himself in discussions for a place in the Wallabies\u2019 23-man squad for the quarter-final. Tupou was involved in the Wallabies\u2019 fourth and final try when he took an offload from lock centurian Rob Simmons, made a burst and then off-loaded to replacement half-back Will Genia. It took the Wallabies a lot longer to get on top of Georgia than perhaps they would have liked, but a tough, physical hit-out was just what they needed in their final match before the knockout stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
