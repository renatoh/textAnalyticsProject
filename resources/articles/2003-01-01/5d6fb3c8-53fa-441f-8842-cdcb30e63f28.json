Obergurgl (65/250cm) and St Anton (30/270cm) in western Austria are in good condition. Top French conditions are in Val D'Is\u00e8re (78/155cm) and Tignes (84/210cm), with great cover and challenging skiing. The Swiss resort Saas-Fee (74/220cm) has excellent skiing and riding. There is a little skiing in Scotland - The Lecht resort (5/15cm) has three lifts open The western United States and Canada have good, if somewhat dwindling, snow. Pick of the week is Killington, Vermont in the eastern US, (100/212cm), where plenty of recent falls leave tremendous conditions.
