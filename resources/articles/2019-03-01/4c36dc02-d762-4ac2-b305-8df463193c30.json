The prime minister was humiliated yet again amid chaotic scenes on Wednesday night in parliament, as her cabinet ruptured three ways and MPs inflicted two more defeats on the government to demand no deal should be taken off the table permanently. In an unprecedented night of Tory splits, four cabinet ministers, Amber Rudd, David Mundell, David Gauke and Greg Clark, defied their party\u2019s last-minute whip and refused to vote against the government\u2019s own motion, after it was amended to rule out any prospect of no-deal Brexit. Six other cabinet ministers also splintered to back a separate proposal for a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, despite the prime minister\u2019s warning that the plan was doomed. After her defeat, May signalled she would gamble one last time on forcing through her Brexit deal, bringing forward a motion on Thursday on delaying Brexit which would \u201cset out the fundamental choice facing this house\u201d. If MPs agreed a deal, she said, the government would request a \u201cshort, technical extension\u201d to article 50, a hint that May plans a third meaningful vote next week. Without an agreed deal, she said, there would be a \u201cmuch longer extension\u201d that would require the UK to take part in European parliament elections. \u201cI do not think that would be the right outcome,\u201d May said. In a defiant reply, Steve Baker, the vice-chair of the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, said rebel Eurosceptics would not be cowed. \u201cI\u2019ll say to the government now, when meaningful vote three comes back I will see to it that we keep voting this down however many times it\u2019s brought back. \u201cWhatever pressure we\u2019re put under and come what may, please don\u2019t do it, keep going back to the EU and say: \u2018It won\u2019t pass.\u2019\u201d Other Tory rebels sounded far less certain. Simon Clarke said there was \u201ca gun to my head at this point\u201d and suggested he could back the deal next time. \u201cI think voters will appreciate we have a very, very limited range of options left if we want to actually honour the manifesto commitment to leave at all. Now it\u2019s effectively a bad Brexit deal or no Brexit at all, which is absolutely ghastly.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s warning of an extended Brexit delay followed a disastrous night in parliament for the government. MPs amended May\u2019s motion ruling out no deal on 29 March to a much more radical proposition, ruling out no deal altogether. That amendment, originally proposed by the Tory backbencher Caroline Spelman but brought to a vote by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, passed by four votes. After a frantic conference on the floor of the Commons, panicking whips demanded that Tory MPs now vote against the government\u2019s own amended motion \u2013 but were still resoundingly defeated by a majority of 43. The minister for disabled people, Sarah Newton, resigned from the Department for Work and Pensions in order to vote in favour of the amended motion and a slew of other ministers also abstained, including the energy minister Claire Perry, solicitor general Robert Buckland, defence minister Tobias Ellwood, business minister Richard Harrington, digital minister Margot James and foreign minister Alistair Burt. Sources close to the abstaining ministers claimed they had been given the nod to skip the vote. It was indicated by sources on Wednesday night that cabinet ministers who abstained did not intend to resign and Downing Street said they would not be pushed. Mundell, the Scotland secretary, said he could not in conscience have opposed the amendment. \u201cI\u2019ve always opposed a no-deal Brexit. The house made its view clear by agreeing the Spelman amendment. I didn\u2019t think it was right for me to oppose that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe PM has my full support in her objective of leaving the EU with a deal to deliver an orderly Brexit.\u201d Remainer cabinet ministers urged their colleagues not to back Spelman\u2019s amendment, believing a thumping victory for the government motion would send a strong signal to Eurosceptics. An alarmed Spelman then attempted to withdraw her amendment but was barred by the Speaker, John Bercow, who said the amendment could be moved by other supportive MPs. Cooper moved the amendment instead and the government was defeated by four votes. The vote does not definitively preclude a no-deal Brexit \u2013 MPs must still agree a deal, or extend or revoke article 50 in order to do that \u2013 but it underlined both the strength of feeling at Westminster and the government\u2019s loss of control. May\u2019s warning about a potentially lengthy delay to Brexit came as it emerged the DUP is back in talks with senior government figures about what it would take for them to back May\u2019s deal at a third Commons vote. A party source said \u201cchannels are open\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus that his opposition to the government deal was \u201cnot a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default\u201d and said he could vote for the deal if it was backed by the DUP. Discussions are taking place around a point that Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, raised in the House of Commons before Tuesday\u2019s vote, relating to \u201chow article 62 of the Vienna convention could be used\u201d. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, replied that the UK would have the ability to terminate the withdrawal agreement \u201cif the facts clearly warranted that there had been an unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances\u201d. An ERG source said this had been written by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, but had not made it into his final legal advice on Tuesday. \u201cIf we\u2019d had it earlier in the day it could have changed the vote,\u201d the source said. Earlier on Wednesday night, May was also forced to allow a free vote on an amendment by Tory backbenchers based on the so-called Malthouse compromise, which suggested a 21-month transition to no deal. The amendment was comfortably defeated by Conservative MPs and opposition parties, 374 votes to 164, but the vote drove an even deeper wedge into May\u2019s fracturing cabinet. Six cabinet ministers voted in favour of the proposal: Gavin Williamson, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom, Sajid Javid and Alun Cairns \u2013 many of them tipped as future leadership candidates. In the aftermath of the vote, Brussels warned that the Commons vote blocking a no-deal Brexit was meaningless. A senior EU negotiator described it as \u201cthe Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way\u201d. A commission spokesman said it was \u201cnot enough to vote against no deal \u2013 you have to agree to a deal \u2026 We have agreed a deal with the prime minister and the EU is ready to sign it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
