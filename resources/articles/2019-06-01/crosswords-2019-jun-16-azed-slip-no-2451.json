Favourite clue, of 15 mentioned, was \u2018Prance about \u2013 what you do when hanging a picture?\u2019 for TITUP, well ahead of the rest. By common consent the puzzle as a whole was easier than average, and a few of you suggested that this seemed to be part of a trend. Are the advancing years bringing out a gentler tendency in my cluing? Not deliberately, I can assure you. My aim, as always, is to present you with a reasonably tough challenge (including a fair number of unfamiliar words to appeal to your lexical curiosity) which at the same time is enjoyable to solve. The level of difficulty in any given puzzle or individual clue is, I think, often determined by the words themselves and only emerges during the cluing process. The clue word this month offered a wealth of possible approaches, not least because of the huge number of synonyms of \u2018head\u2019 that exists in the language. A significant minority made the error that might be called the \u2018synonym of a synonym fallacy\u2019. This assumes that because \u2018head\u2019 can be defined as (say) \u2018chump\u2019(see some quoted clues above) and a chump is also a fool, it is permissible to define \u2018head\u2019 as \u2018fool\u2019. It is not. Two other cluing ideas are worth mentioning. Quite a lot of competitors linked \u2018caput\u2019 with \u2018kapu(t)\u2019 in homophone-type clues, though the stress pattern of the two words differs, but that apart, the attempt to link the two words was generally unconvincing. (Interestingly, \u2018kaput\u2019, from the German word, appears to be of similar origin to the French word \u2018capot\u2019 used in the card game piquet.) The same was true for clues that exploited the name of Tupac Shakur, the American rapper and occasional actor who was murdered at the age of 25. His name, if not his music, is familiar to me. Linking it semantically with \u2018caput\u2019 was hard to do persuasively. Bear in mind, as always, the importance of the surface reading of your clue, i.e. the desirability of producing reasonable and recognisable sense overall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
