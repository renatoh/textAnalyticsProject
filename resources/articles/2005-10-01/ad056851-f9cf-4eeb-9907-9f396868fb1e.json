You might be a little taken aback. \"There is an underlying assumption among many in the media that those in the government are either incompetent or corrupt,\" he says. The hunger for instant revelation, most bluntly displayed by the 24-hour news channels, \"often tilts reporters' balance towards speed at the expense of accuracy and fairness\". To be fair to James Rubin, he made these comments more than five years ago, in a different time - he was chief spokesman for President Clinton's state department - and a different place: the United States. But you can bet that he did not repeat these views when he was being sounded out for the job he begins in a few days. Next week, he will be sitting in the presenter's chair in Sky News's shiny new multimillion pound studios firing the very questions that once he sought to dodge. So is 24-hour news still such a threat to democracy? \"First of all, those opinions I still believe. Those are problems with the intensity of the media culture that's evolved with the internet and the 24-hour news system. [But] there are pluses too: the world knows what's going on around the world instantly; world leaders need to make decisions based on the knowledge that everyone knows what's going on.\" He did not mention that when he was trying to fend off pesky journalists. \"No, of course I didn't.\" He compares himself to a lawyer: his was not a court of law but the court of opinion. \"And just like a defence lawyer doesn't tell the courtroom the reasons why you might think his client is guilty, my goal in giving that speech, as I recall it, was to try to make journalists think about some of the downsides of this 24-hour culture so that they hopefully would improve things.\" Today he still believes the demands of 24-news can be distorting. \"If government spokesmen don't immediately comment, it does not mean that they are 'taken by surprise' or 'caught off balance'\". The situation required him to remind reporters of that: \"My job was to obtain the best possible coverage of the government by holding journalists accountable.\" His role is now a little different. In American jargon, he has switched from being a flack - a PR - to a hack. His World News Tonight show, an hour of analysis and context rather than between-the-eyes confrontation, is a deliberate push by Sky to inject new depth into its foreign affairs coverage. Rubin's experience at the centre of government - he did more than spin, he was also an active negotiator in foreign affairs - brought him into close contact with world leaders and their senior apparatchiks. So his contacts book might come in handy too. \"I know these people,\" he says, \"and hopefully I can encourage them to find the right time to discuss their relevant subject.\" But the switch surprises some American journalists who remember how cagey he could be at his daily on-camera press briefings. \"He has a depth of knowledge, there is no question at all that he is brilliant,\" observes Roy Gutman, foreign editor of Newsweek magazine. \"But he had a swagger about him too: there was a certain sense that he knew an awful lot but was not necessarily going to tell you much.\" This runs a little counter to Rubin's take on events: \"Ninety-five per cent of my day was spent figuring out how to encourage reticent officials to let me say as much as possible,\" he says, adding: \"Most of what I did each day was explaining, analysing and persuading - not spinning, doing soundbites and intimidating journalists.\" Rubin's life is now very different from the one he left in 2000, \"burned out\" and \"exhausted mentally and physically\". Leaving the American political machine behind, he moved to London, to live with his wife, CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, who was already based in Britain. \"I don't think I would have married a journalist if I didn't regard journalism as an honourable profession.\" They now have a five-year-old son and Rubin relishes being close at hand as he grows up. Following 9/11, he found US and British broadcasters turning to him for on-air punditry. He was also associated for a time with the blue-chip PR agency Brunswick, but this was said to have been something of a \"vanity signing\" by the company and he did not spend long there. Then the call came through from Sky. It could be seen as rather brave of Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, to offer Rubin the job. After all, the largest shareholder in Sky is Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (it owns 37.2%). BSkyB's chief executive is Rupert's son James. While we might not know much about James's politics, we know plenty about his father's: much more neo-con Republican than Rubin's liberal Clintonite views. Though Rubin will not say it outright, it is clear that there are parts of the Murdoch protectorate that leave him feeling uncomfortable. But Sky News is imbued with an impartiality most definitely not seen elsewhere in the Murdoch empire. \"When I met Nick and we had our first discussions, I immediately sensed that I was dealing with people in the tradition of producing news without fear or favour,\" says Rubin. He talks about Murdoch senior's media interests without once mentioning by name Fox News, the \"fair and balanced\" pro-Republican channel that has consistently referred to US troops in Iraq as \"heroes\" and \"liberators\" and which two years ago headlined the million-strong anti-war demonstration in London \"March Madness\". But it is not difficult to read between the lines. \"I feel like Sky is straight. I don't think I could've worked for them if they weren't. I watched it in government; we treated it as a straight news organisation. And I think, without naming names, that isn't true with every television network either within the Murdoch empire or outside of Murdoch's News Corporation.\" At Sky, \"there is no hidden agenda or open agenda - the only agenda is news. And that's why I feel comfortable there. And I can't say I would've felt comfortable in every part of the Murdoch organisation.\" In any case Sky is employing him for his expertise not his opinions. \"I'd like to think that if there were a Republican with as much knowledge and experience as I have - and as good on television as I hope I am - that they'd hire him too.\" One final question. If he would not feel at ease elsewhere in the Murdoch fold, what does he make of Rupert's own recent attempt at political reporting? The News Corp chief recently claimed - \"I probably shouldn't be telling you this,\" he smirked - that Tony Blair privately described the BBC's coverage of Hurricane Katrina as \"gloating\" over America's troubles and \"full of hate\". Does Rubin agree? He dodges but stops very short of backing the BBC. \"Look, I'm an American. And I'm just entering formally the journalism business. I can certainly tell you that over the years in this country, and in other countries, I've seen reporting that I felt was anti-American and didn't like it. And I doubt I will ever like it. But I just don't think that it's up to me to point fingers.\" But the question does not ask him to point any fingers - merely to agree or disagree with our prime minister's alleged verdict on recent media coverage. At this, the former spokesman refuses to speak. There is a seven second pause. (I time it) before an answer: \"No comment.\" \u00b7 World News Tonight with James Rubin will be broadcast weeknights from 8pm-9pm on Sky News"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
