It's about food, and real people, and a little bit about Britain, sometimes there's even a little inebriation \u2013 what's not to like? For those of us who don't have, or get invited to, dinner parties very often, it's the next best thing \u2013 or even better maybe, because it's less stressful and there's no washing up. MW'sDS is clearly a rip-off of CDWM, with one extra ingredient: MW. And it's this that wrecks it, for two reasons. One: it's no longer about funny ordinary people, their funny lives and the funny things they cook; it's now about Michael Winner. And two: Michael Winner isn't very good television; he's just really annoying, like he is on that insurance advert. Calm down dear, it's a television programme that lasts a whole hour. Argghhh. This week he's in Essex, where he buys a flat cap and does Essex girls jokes. And Scotland, where he pretends not to understand what the locals are saying. Good one, Michael. He shouts at people, thinking he's being funny, but he's not \u2013 he's just being shouty, and annoying. He gives Peter in Essex one of his tacky awards \u2013 not for the food, which he doesn't rate, but because Peter's sister is there, plus another friend, two blond Essex girls Michael can be amused by. They give him a little quiz on the subject of Michael Winner, which he enjoys. They make him the centre of attention, laugh at his jokes, flirt with him, so they get a star. On Tayside, at Charmian's house, it's a different story. The focus of the evening isn't Winner, it's a bunch of friends having a nice time. And he doesn't like that, so he gives Charmian nothing. Well, he makes her come up to London for his ridiculous theatrical ceremony, and then sends her away with nothing. Charmian shouldn't mind too much though, apart from the wasted journey. A Michael Winner Dining Star is a hideous thing, and would spoil any mantelpiece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
