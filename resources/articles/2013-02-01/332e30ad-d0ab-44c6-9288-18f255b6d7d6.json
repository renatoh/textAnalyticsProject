Not funny peculiar, or funny ha-ha, just plain odd. Since 1980 there have been 16 tournaments in odd-numbered years and 14 have been won by one of three countries: England, France or Ireland. The exceptions were Scotland in 1999 and Wales in 2005 but a supposedly madly unpredictable competition has a biennial habit of reverting to type. No one really notices, or complains, because the Six Nations has a perennially catchy rhythm, a grand, old lady reliably nifty on her pins. For those keen to pick a winner of the 2013 edition the odds suggest a strictly three-way dance-off, based purely on this season's fixtures. It will be a considerable surprise if the hexagonal trophy does not end up stuffed with white, blue or green ticker tape. Which is not to say a dull and formulaic tournament awaits. On the contrary, it could easily be a belter. As England will be reminded todayon Saturday, there is nothing as motivating as being told you are making up the numbers. Scotland have three games at home and a belated Twickenham surprise will materialise one day. It may not happen this time but that is not the point. Just ask Wales. Despite losing their past seven international games, last year's grand slam showed what is possible when no one gives you a prayer. A wooden spoon, on the other hand, will beckon if they keep on losing. Imagine how that would undermine morale before this summer's Lions tour to Australia. But let's not get diverted from the central thesis. It is an odd year, which means France will have a major say. Should they conquer Twickenham and Dublin in rounds three and four, their final game at home to Scotland could be a lap of honour unless Italy or Wales intervene en route. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 says he has a generation of young players who could shine for the next five to six years and, lest anyone forget, Toulon and Clermont Auvergne are Europe's club heavyweights. The Six Nations, as Saint-Andr\u00e9 will be the first to tell you, is not that simple. For a start France have won one championship game at Twickenham since 1997 and then by a single point, in 2005. As for the dressing-rooms of Toulon and Clermont, they are cosmopolitan in the extreme. Last season only eight of the 28 wings participating in a round of the French Top 14 were French qualified. The prop statistics were even worse; two French tightheads were regular first-choices on occasions. The talent, nevertheless, keeps on flowing, with Wesley Fofana, Louis Picamoles, Morgan Parra and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak among the likely stand-out players of the tournament. It is consistency that remains elusive. Winning in Dublin should be achievable \u2013 their pack will definitely fancy squeezing Ireland's tight five \u2013 but London is a different matter. For some reason the French seem to wilt at the sight of a red rose in its natural habitat. At this distance I fancy England to win that encounter; even Italy could run a slightly odd-looking France selection close in Rome on Sunday. Sergio Parisse, Italy's captain, is by far the most gung-ho in the championship. \"We have the weapons and the talent to get more than one victory \u2026 we want to have a big Six Nations.\" Those in the firing line may even include Ireland in Rome in March, particularly if the visiting tighthead, Mike Ross, fails to last the course. When they get a rattle on \u2013 as England can testify \u2013 Ireland's pack are a match for anyone, but depth in certain positions remains a concern. That said they will be ready when England come calling; for every mention of last year's one-sided Twickenham scrumfest there will be a knowing reference to the Dublin drubbing of 2011. Victory over Wales in Cardiff would also provide timely momentum and their coach, Declan Kidney, is another who enjoys being written off. If Ireland do not finish in the top half, questions will be asked. Which leaves England. Arrogant England, according to Jim Telfer. Not for the first time recently, the former Scotland coach is behind the times. There could hardly be a more grounded coach than Stuart Lancaster. One swallow dive of delight against New Zealand does not a team of big heads make. Nor, as the players are well aware, does it mean England are the finished article. While the All Black result was a spectacular glimpse of what they could become, the Six Nations is a different kind of challenge. If they do win the grand slam it will confirm Lancaster as a brilliant alchemist. Four wins and a title claimed on points difference is more likely. A radically different outcome would feel very odd indeed.
