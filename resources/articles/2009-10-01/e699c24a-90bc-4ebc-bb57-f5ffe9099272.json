Everton travel to Portugal today for a Europa League group game against Benfica on Thursday, make the short journey to play Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on Sunday and then head to White Hart Lane for the fourth-round tie with Spurs. The Football League, organisers of the Carling Cup, were arguably left with little choice but to arrange the Spurs game for Tuesday after Arsenal versus Liverpool, another north London against Merseyside fixture, was selected for live TV purposes on the Wednesday night. Moyes, however, believes no consideration has been given to Everton's workload and that he may have to review his policy of fielding strong teams in the competition. \"My philosophy has always been to try and put our best teams in whatever competition we enter, but I find the lack of respect we have been shown by the Carling Cup organisers really disappointing,\" said the Everton manager. \"We have been asked to play Tottenham at White Hart Lane on a Tuesday night after playing the previous Thursday and Sunday at Benfica and Bolton. I am aware that other clubs will have a similar scenario but they haven't got games on Thursday and again on the Sunday. It could have been quite easily been moved but for the decision to screen Arsenal v Liverpool on the Wednesday.\" Moyes also claimed the competition's sponsors should be concerned if, due to Everton's exertions in Portugal and the Premier League this week, he is forced to join the procession of managers who field weakened teams in the Carling Cup. \"That's the support you get for trying to put out your strongest teams in as many competitions as possible,\" he added. \"If I was Carling, I would question the people running the competition.\" Everton's left-back Leighton Baines has echoed his manager's sentiments and believes Moyes will have to rotate his resources. \"It's a tough schedule,\" he said. \"It's going to be a really tough game in Benfica and then we have a quick turnaround with away games on Sunday and Tuesday. It's a lot of travelling. I think the whole squad will be used at some point. The manager will be looking to change people around and because of the way we are playing in the Premier League at the moment, nobody's place is safe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
