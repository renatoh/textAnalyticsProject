Greste, who grew up in Brisbane, has been imprisoned in Cairo since 29 December along with his co-workers Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. Fahmy's family have confirmed that the three men have all been transferred to a separate section of Tora prison in Cairo. Two other al-Jazeera journalists have been in detention for five months. The move follows heavy condemnation around the world for the detention of the journalists, with the US President Barack Obama's spokesman calling for their release on Tuesday. On Thursday a charge sheet was released by Egyptian authorities, which named a number of other journalists affiliated with al-Jazeera. The list included the names of a Dutch journalist who has since fled Cairo, two British journalists and a number of other al-Jazeera staff based in Doha. Sue Turton, one of the British journalists who was named on the charge sheet, said: \"I find it quite extraordinary that my stories on everything from Cairo pollution and TV satire to protests from all sides of the fence could be seen as assisting a terrorist group. Myself and the al-Jazeera English team in Cairo did all we could to provide balanced coverage in what had become very difficult circumstances on the ground.\" On Monday leaked video footage emerged of the arrest of Greste and Fahmy, which al-Jazeera denounced as \"propaganda\". Last Thursday the Australian Greens leader, Christine Milne, called on the prime minister, Tony Abbott, to intervene in the case and make representations on behalf of Greste. There has been widespread international condemnation of Egypt\u2019s detention of journalists. Australia\u2019s Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance called on journalists to sign a petition for the release of the trio. The US senator John McCain also called for the release of the journalists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
