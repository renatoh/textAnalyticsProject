She promised to make \"further improvements\" to the policies under which she approved Paul Reeve for work as a PE teacher if reforms were found to be necessary. Mr Reeve was given a job at the Hewett School in Norwich last month despite being cautioned for accessing banned images of children on the internet. Parents' leaders described the episode as \"terrifying\" and the Tories accused Ms Kelly of \"a serious lapse of judgment\" after details of the case emerged at the weekend. In her first public comments on the matter, Ms Kelly said in a statement tonight: \"Our first priority has always been the protection of children. \"Whilst we do not comment on individual cases, decisions have to be taken on the basis of the evidence and within the legal framework. \"We are already reforming the current system by developing a new vetting and barring scheme with the Home Office and police which will provide better protection for children and vulnerable adults. \"I have also asked my officials to review this case to see whether any further changes are necessary. \"We will consider for example whether we can ensure greater correlation between the sex offenders' register and List 99. \"If further improvements are needed on the basis of advice received, I won't hesitate in making them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
