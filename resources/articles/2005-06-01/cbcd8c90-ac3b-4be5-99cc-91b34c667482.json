The giveaway, to be called MarketPlace Weekly, will be focused around classified advertising. It will be supported by editorial reprinted from the relevant New York Times sections including Job Market, Real Estate, Automotive, Business and Dining Out. The company will initially print 150,000 copies a week which will be distributed by teams of people at more than 250 spots heavy with commuter traffic. They will include Grand Central Station, the Staten Island Ferry and the Port Authority bus terminal. The tabloid will be distributed on Thursdays between 3.30pm and 7.30pm, to catch commuters on their way home. Advertisers in the New York Times will have the option of adding MarketPlace to their schedules or of buying space in the weekly exclusively. Jyll Holzman, senior vice president of advertising at the company, described the weekly as a \"wonderful complement\" to the Sunday edition's classified section. \"Advertisers will have an expanded opportunity to reach even more potential customers,\" she said. New York's subway entrances have become increasingly crowded with people giving away free newspapers. There are already two daily free titles circulated in the morning rush hour, amNew York and Metro New York. The New York Times agreed a deal at the beginning of the year to buy a stake in Metro Boston. The company is looking to bolster revenues as the flagship newspaper combats the industry-wide decline in circulations and a still patchy advertising market. Last month, the company announced plans to begin charging for elements of its website nytimes.com. In February, the firm acquired About.com, an online information business for $410m (\u00a3224m). The company has also taken full control of the International Herald Tribune, part of the effort to expand the New York Times brand. In addition, it has been tightening costs and last week announced 190 job cuts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
