Landlords of Arcadia Group\u2019s 570 UK standalone stores, which are also home to Dorothy Perkins, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Outfit and Miss Selfridge, approved the plan on Wednesday, averting a slump into administration that would have put a further 17,000 jobs at risk. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, said: \u201cAfter many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing. \u201cI am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multi-channel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business. The complex deal required 75% of all creditors and at least half of landlords to vote in favour of seven company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), which are insolvency procedures that have been used by a string of high street names to shut stores, including New Look and Mothercare. Green sought to win over landlords with an initial promise to give them a 20% stake in the business and invest an extra \u00a350m in the stores as part of a \u00a3135m turnaround plan intended to help Arcadia compete with rivals such as Asos, Zara and H&amp;M. More here: Sky News\u2019s Adam Parsons has caught up with Sir Philip Green. The retail chief has welcomed today\u2019s support from creditors, and even claimed Arcadia has scored a \u201c95th-minute\u201d winner in its battle for survival. Simply getting its CVA approved today doesn\u2019t guarantee Arcadia\u2019s long-term survival. Nelson Blackley of Nottingham Business School, said points out that other retailers have tried restructuring themselves, but still failed. Given the crisis on the high street, Sir Philip Green needs to innovate, and possibly shut more stores too. \u201cWhat today\u2019s decision hasn\u2019t changed is the level of competition in the fashion retail sector, where online disruptors, such as ASOS and Bohoo.com as well as fast fashion retailers with physical stores such as Zara, H&amp;M and Primark, all of whom have all taken share from Arcadia. As recent history has demonstrated, a CVA is certainly not a guarantee of retail survival. British Home Stores, Austin Reed and Toys R Us, amongst others, all went down the CVA route but eventually failed. \u201c My colleague Sarah Butler\u2019s also heard that Land Securities, one of the UK\u2019s biggest commercial property firms, backed Arcadia\u2019s CVA. We mentioned this morning that Landsec, with its 12 Arcadia stores, could play a crucial role today, along with other waverers such as the Crown Estate who also backed the plan eventually. The FT\u2019s Jonathan Eley says Arcadia\u2019s landlords have resented paying the bill for the company\u2019s poor performance. He writes: Many property companies bitterly resented the terms of the CVA [Company Voluntary Arrangement], saying that it was opportunistic and forced creditors to foot the bill for years of under-investment in the core operations. Arcadia has said it will invest \u00a3135m over three years in refurbishing stores, improving its website and building more distribution capability. But this represents a lower rate of capital spending than seen in previous years and is being financed by improved profit and cash flow, not new investment into the business. Landlords who voted in favour of the plan will share around \u00a340m from a compensation fund, and if Arcadia is sold in the future they will also take 20 per cent of any equity value ascribed to it. We have confirmation that around 1,000 jobs will be lost at Arcadia, through the store closures outlined in the restructuring deal. Stephanie White, Associate and real estate expert at Stevens &amp; Bolton LLP, points out that Arcadia could face a legal challenge from unhappy creditors. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s agreement: \u201cLandlords struck a compromise to avoid the group passing into the hands of the Administrators, which could be catastrophic for the high street. \u201cLandlords pushed the Arcadia group to come up with a better deal and they were right to do that because Arcadia has come up with a proposal that landlords felt able to give their backing. \u201cHowever, Arcadia would be wise to keep the champagne on ice until the period to mount a legal challenge has passed. The deal did not have unanimous support and there is still a risk that the landlords who did not back the deal could find grounds to challenge it.\u201d Frank Field, a long-time critic of Philip Green, is calling on the retail chief to give \u201cbinding promises\u201d that Arcadia\u2019s pensions will be fully guaranteed. Parliament\u2019s Work and Pensions Committee (which Field chairs) has written to the Pensions Regulator seeking \u201cfurther clarity and assurances\u201d over the cash and assets that will be available to plug Arcadia\u2019s massive pension scheme deficit. Field explains: \u201cNow that, thankfully, Arcadia\u2019s life has been extended, the Committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them. Last week the Greens agreed to put \u00a325m more into the pensions pot, having been asked to cough up \u00a350m to fix its black hole. Intu, one of Arcadia\u2019s biggest landlords, has heavily criticised today\u2019s decision after being outvoted by other creditors. Intu says the CVA gives Arcadia an unfair advantage against other retailers, through a lower rent bill. Rating agency Moody\u2019s say today\u2019s rescue deal undermines the financial health of UK property firms. Ramzi Kattan, a vice president at Moody\u2019s explains: \u201cArcadia\u2019s landlords have approved company voluntary arrangements that will close stores and slash rents. This is credit negative for retail property owners, who face continued weak operating performance, with declining footfall and retail sales, and downward pressure on rents.\u201d That explains why landlords rejected the original CVA a week ago, forcing Philip Green to sweeten the deal (with smaller rent cuts). Ultimately, landlords couldn\u2019t face the prospect of shutting hundreds of Arcadia stores across the UK, says Joanne Fearnley, partner and a commercial property expert at law firm Gordons. \u201cUltimately, the risk to the further demise of the High Street and the loss of big names - Topshop, Burton, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins - was too much of a bitter pill for landlords to swallow and they have settled for large rent reductions instead. This means 23 stores will close and the rest of Arcadia\u2019s 500 plus stores will keep trading. The threat of administration has been lifted and jobs saved\u2026for now. But....she also warns that Arcadia\u2019s long-term future is still unclear: \u201cAs we are seeing with other retailers who have followed the same route, time will tell whether or not this is a temporary saving or whether the dent to the confidence of landlords will result in them putting in place contingency plans on the prime locations in particular, so that the demise of Arcadia becomes inevitable over time.\u201d Reaction is flooding in: Here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s Danni Hewson: And here\u2019s James Child of Estates Gazette: By approving Arcadia\u2019a CVA, its landlords have saved the company from collapsing into administration. That means that your local Top Shop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton store will be open as usual tomorrow. Arcadia\u2019s 18,000 staff will still have a job too. But... as part of the deal, some 23 stores will shut, costing hundreds of jobs. Another 25 or so are earmarked to close in future too. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman points out that Arcadia faces further hurdles: This rescue deal will put Arcadia on a firmer financial footing, says its clearly relieved CEO, Ian Grabiner. He says: \u201cWe are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals and to Lady Green for her continued support. After many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing. \u201cFrom today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the Group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth through our digital and wholesale channels, while ensuring our store portfolio remains at the heart of our customer offer. \u201cI am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multi-channel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand, and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business. \u201cFinally, I would like to thank all of our team and advisors for their support throughout the CVA process. It has been incredibly challenging for all concerned but I believe this is the right outcome for all our creditors.\u201d It\u2019s Official: Arcadia\u2019s creditors have, as we thought, approved the company\u2019s rescue plan. Here\u2019s the company\u2019s statement, which explains how the Green family are putting millions of pounds of their own money into the deal (to persuade landlords to swallow hefty rent reductions). Arcadia Group creditors approve CVA proposals Arcadia Group is pleased to announce that all seven of its Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs) have today been approved by the required majority of the companies\u2019 creditors, including its pension trustees, suppliers and landlords. As described in the CVA proposals, upon there being no remaining risk of challenge to the CVAs, the Group\u2019s majority shareholder, Lady Green, will invest \u00a350m of equity into the Group, in addition to the \u00a350m of funding already provided in March. Lady Green has also agreed to fund the cost of the amended rental reduction terms within the CVA proposals, as announced on 7 June. Separately, the Group has reached an agreement with the Trustees of the pension schemes, the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, by which Arcadia Group will reduce its deficit repair contributions from \u00a350m to \u00a325m per year, for three years, with security granted to the value of \u00a3210m over certain assets of the Group, to further support the schemes. As previously announced, Lady Green will provide an additional \u00a3100m of cash into the schemes to help bridge the shortfall, with funding of \u00a325m per year for the next three years plus an additional \u00a325m contribution. Property Week\u2019s David Parsley has also heard that Sir Philip Green may have succeeded in persuading creditors to back his rescue plan. My colleague Sarah Butler has heard that all seven of Arcadia\u2019s CVAs have passed. That\u2019s unconfirmed at this stage -- but if it\u2019s correct, it means that the threat of administration has been lifted. It would mean that 23 stores would close, but the rest of Arcadia\u2019s 500+ estate of shops would keep trading. More to follow! The delay is causing some jitters among Arcadia\u2019s landlords..... Oh dear! We\u2019ve now hearing that the results of the creditors\u2019 vote may not come for another hour or so. That\u2019s two hours later than expected. What does it mean? It could be a sign that at least one of the seven CVA agreements has been rejected (confusingly, there is one vote for each of Arcadia\u2019s seven brands). Or it could mean that Sir Philip Green is engaged in some last-minute arm twisting. This is turning into a repeat of last Wednesday\u2019s meeting, when the CVA process was dramatically delayed once it became clear the vote was going against Arcadia. Journalists, alas, weren\u2019t allowed into today\u2019s Arcadia meeting, but here\u2019s some photos from outside: The bells of St Paul\u2019s have rung out to mark 4pm. But there\u2019s no word from Arcadia\u2019s creditors meeting, just around the corner from the Cathedral at Etc Venues on Aldersgate. Surely the result of the votes will come soon.... Brexit has helped to drag Arcadia to the brink of administration, says senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She points out that a clutch of retailers have hit serious problems since the 2016 referendum: Brexit is slowly but incredibly persistently eroding the confidence and the spending power of the British consumer. The process started fairly discreetly but given that it has now been in place for close to three years it is claiming more and more victims. Notable business failures this year alone include Debenhams, LK Bennett, Wine Direct, Office Outlet, Steamer Trading, Patisserie Valerie, OddBins and Jamie Oliver\u2019s chain of restaurants. The list is already long and scary enough without adding the big closures of 2017 and 2018. Factor in the rise in online shopping, and high business rates, and it all adds up to a crisis. The Arcadia crisis has put Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVA) under the spotlight. CVAs allow a company to restructure itself without going into a formal administration or liquidation. The theory is that it lets fundamentally decent businesses shed underperforming assets and keep running. The practice, critics say, is that creditors are kicked in the teeth when their customers use CVAs to escape contracts. In Arcadia\u2019s case, the firm hopes to cut its overall rental bill (which is says is simply too high in today\u2019s retail environment), and close 23 stores (with another 27 are also earmarked for closure). Retail chain Sports Direct has just kicked out at CVAs, saying they let \u201cbarely managed\u201d businesses limp on. It\u2019s launching a legal challenge to Debenhams\u2019 recent CVA (which thwarted Mike Ashley\u2019s attempts to take the company over). This is turning into another worrying day for Arcadia\u2019s 18,000 staff, as they wait for news on whether landlords will accept Philip Greens\u2019 CVA proposal or not. Jobs and pensions are both at risk, says Vishal Makkar, Head of Retirement Consulting at Buck, the pensions consultancy: \u201cWith the traditional British high street struggling in recent years, and both Debenhams and House of Fraser recently calling in the administrators, news of the Arcadia Group potentially entering administration itself should perhaps come as no surprise. But, surprising or not, Arcadia\u2019s closure will have some very real implications for thousands of people. With up to 18,000 jobs at stake and a pension scheme deficit of \u00a3750m, Arcadia\u2019s staff face the prospect of redundancy and a sizeable cutback in pension benefits, if the Group falls into the Protection Pension Levy (PPF). This is interesting. Ashley Armstrong of the Telegraph has heard that Arcadia told landlords that it only needs 300 stores, rather than its current 500+ estate. That suggests further closures, or sales, are possible, even if today\u2019s rescue deal is approved [reminder: Arcadia is currently only planning to shut 50 stores] Heads-up.... the Arcadia results may not come until 4pm, an hour later than we thought. Some food has arrived for the vote counters..... Retail analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien has put his finger on Arcadia\u2019s fundamental problem -- Sir Philip Green is no longer King of the High Street, and his prize assets now look tarnished. Oliver Buhus from Paragon Clothing, one of Arcadia\u2019s suppliers, is angry with Arcadia\u2019s landlords for not giving the company more support. Sky News\u2019s Tom Boadle has the details from outside today\u2019s creditors meeting: The fact that today\u2019s vote is taking place at all may suggest Sir Philip Green thinks he\u2019s won enough landlords round (he needs 75% support). But creditors leaving the meeting tell us that the result is still up in the air.... Voting is now underway, to decide the fate of one of Britain\u2019s biggest retail groups. Arcadia landlords are already leaving the meeting near St Paul\u2019s, so we may hear from them soon..... The Arcadia meeting is having a short presentation about updates to the CVA and then there will be a vote - the results of which are expected by about 15.00 - possibly later. One clothing and fabric supplier attending the meeting said he was hoping the CVA would pass. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be good for our business (if it doesn\u2019t),\u201d he said. Gerry Matthews of Eternal Design Studio, a clothing supplier, said he was \u201cvery much in favour of [the CVA] going through. But he admitted it was not clear how the vote would play out after Philip Green\u2019s last minute improvement on his offer to landlords. \u201cHe probably plays poker quite well,\u201d Matthews said. Even Arcadia\u2019s own creditors don\u2019t know how today\u2019s vote will turn out, reports Property Week\u2019s David Parsley. A quick reminder of what\u2019s happening: Arcadia is presenting its creditors with seven Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVA). They cover all its high street brands brands - Topshop, Topman, Burton Menswear, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis. Arcadia says that every CVA must pass, otherwise the whole company could be placed into administration. That would threaten 18,000 jobs - although there is speculation that some brands could be saved, with others closing. The proposal would see around 50 of Arcadia\u2019s 570 stores close, with rent cuts of 25%-50% on the rest. After the plan was rejected last week, Sir Philip Green sweetened the deal with extra money for landlords, and lower rent reductions. That hasn\u2019t persuaded one major landlord, Intu, who is expected to vote against the proposal Others are more positive - Crown Estates has said it will back the CVA Breaking! The Crown Estate has confirmed that it is backing Arcadia\u2019s restructuring plan today. That increases the chances that the CVA deal is approved today, sparing Arcadia from administration. A spokesperson for the Estate, which manages the Queen\u2019s property assets, says: \u201cWhile we have voted in favour, we have done so to secure our ability to take control where we feel that a better offer can be delivered for our destinations. This may include re-letting our spaces to new retailers who are more aligned with our ongoing commitment to creating great places for local communities.\u201d The meeting on whether to approve, or reject, Arcadia\u2019s CVA restructuring deal is getting underway now. Here\u2019s the latest chatter from outside the meeting: If today\u2019s CVA deal fails, Arcadia could plunge into administration ending a history dating back over 100 years. The story all starts in Yorkshire at the start of the last century, where Montague Burton fled to escape the anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian province of Kovno. There, he began a tailoring business which grew, thrived, and floated on the stock market in 1929. Burton\u2019s son then launched Topshop in the 1960s, before Philip Green showed up the scene some decades later. Here\u2019s the full history: A small crowd of reporters has gathered outside Etc Venues on Aldersgate, near St Paul\u2019s in central London. Inside, Arcadia\u2019s creditors will soon start voting on whether to accept the CVA agreement, having rejected it a week ago. The Queen\u2019s property empire, the Crown Estate, has decided to support Arcadia\u2019s restructuring, my colleague Sarah Butler hears. That\u2019s a boost for Philip Green. Last weekend, the Estate was locked in talks with Arcadia over today\u2019s CVA votes. David Parsley of Property Week agrees that Land Securities holds the key to Arcadia\u2019s rescue deal. Retail Week\u2019s Luke Tugby has heard that the vote, due sometime afternoon, could be extremely close.... Correction: Land Securities owns 12 Arcadia stores, not 24 as I mis-wrote earlier. Even so, their vote at today\u2019s CVA will be crucial to the group\u2019s future, and the jobs of thousands of employees. Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s latest Arcadia story, for those looking to get up to speed before today\u2019s CVA vote: Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire faces a make-or-break vote on its future on Wednesday as it seeks approval for its restructuring plans, deciding the fate of 18,000 employees. Arcadia, the company behind Topshop, Wallis, Burton and a raft of other brands, will reconvene a meeting to vote on seven separate company voluntary arrangement (CVA) proposals. The votes are for creditors - primarily landlords of the stores - who must either agree to cut their rents by approving the deal, or risk the collapse of Arcadia, leaving them with empty sites and no rent. Voting was supposed to take place last Wednesday, but was postponed when it became clear that some of the CVA proposals were heading for failure without more concessions from Sir Philip and Arcadia. It is understood that only those proposals which did not receive enough support at a previous meeting last week will be voted on again. If passed at a meeting in central London at 12pm on Wednesday, at least 23 stores will close. A further 25 Miss Selfridge and Evans outlets have also been earmarked for closure as part of a restructuring process that is separate from the CVAs. Sir Philip has since offered a concession to landlords in a bid to sweeten the deal, proposing to impose less severe rent cuts than originally planned. Under the initial proposals, shop owners were facing rent reductions of between 30% and 70%. This will now be reduced to a range of 25% to 50%. It remains to be seen whether enough property owners will be convinced to support the process. Speaking to the Press Association, one landlord said the Arcadia CVA plans are different from previous ones from House of Fraser or Debenhams because the smaller units would be easier to fill with new occupiers. \u201cThere was some sympathy for Debenhams,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas here you\u2019ve got a bigger pool of potential tenants. You\u2019ve got more options so it\u2019s easier to vote against it. \u201cNot that many people are that emotional about it - there\u2019s no tears for Philip Green.\u201d Incidentally, the Green family yacht has been sighted -- at Sanrimo, Italy. Retail experts are watching events at Arcadia closely today. Analyst Nick Bubb says: The increasingly embattled Philip Green is scrambling to save his business after further principled resistance from Intu Properties to the Arcadia CVA plan. Ian Shepherd points out that the crisis in Britain\u2019s high street extends beyond Arcadia: Some of the opposition to Arcadia\u2019s restructuring plan stems from the fact that the Green family are so stonkingly wealthy. Lady Tina Green (who actually owns the company) famously collected a \u00a31.2bn special dividend back in 2005. That has helped to support a glamorous lifestyle abroad.... think luxury yachts, private jets and glitzy parties. Landlords will also have noted that Lady T splashed out \u00a3190,000 on a bottle of 1869 Chateau Lafite Rothschild. In her defence, the money went to a cancer charity - but it\u2019s reminded critics that the family won\u2019t be seeking out Monaco\u2019s nearest food bank anytime soon. My colleague Nils Pratley, though, argues that creditors should look beyond the \u00a3100m Lionheart yacht, and approve the deal to keep Top Shop, Miss Selfridge et al running. Green and his wife paid themselves a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 and could, in any subsequent year, have chosen to hand back some of their winnings to repair the pension deficit. Instead, they still cruise the Mediterranean in a superyacht. For parallel reasons, you see why Intu is furious. If it agrees rental concessions to a billionaire sunning himself in the waters off Monaco, what\u2019s it supposed to say to other tenants who would also like to pay less? On the other hand, Intu is kidding itself if it thinks it can seriously halt the slide in rental values in retail land. After three upwards only decades, the market has turned. Neither side deserves to win this CVA fight, in other words. In the absence of an honourable victor, preserving jobs and securing even an underwhelming pensions deal (\u00a3175m of cash over three years, plus \u00a3210m of securities) should be the priority. Best to allow Arcadia to limp on. Chris Field, independent retail analyst and Chairman of Retail Connections, predicts that Arcadia\u2019s creditors will reject today\u2019s rescue deal. However, he doesn\u2019t believe this would plunge the company immediately into administration: \u201cI think they\u2019ll reject Philip Green\u2019s current rescue deal and there will be more discussions, but at some point, the landlords and shareholders are going to have to accept some kind of a deal. The UK retail environment is still a difficult one and, inevitably, there will be some casualties as the High Street reinvents itself. While the deal remains on a knife edge - and I do foresee the investors turning the knife on the deal - the outcome of Sir Philip\u2019s retail empire is by no means certain. Things never are as dire as the business owners like to say, and Sir Philip is no fool; this is a a man who won Retailer of the Year just a few years ago and, ultimately, money comes first - this could well be the catalyst for reinvention, rather than the ultimate road to ruin for Arcadia.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Sean Farrington has recorded a handy explanation of today\u2019s vote on Arcadia\u2019s future: Arcadia\u2019s problems are partly due to the rise in internet shopping. The company\u2019s sales and profits have slumped as shoppers shun the high street in favour of buying online. Bang on cue, UK online fashion group Boohoo have underlined this -- reporting a 39% surge in revenue in the last three months. Boohoo, which owns the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, says it is \u201cwell-positioned to disrupt, gain market share and capitalise on the global opportunity in front of us.\u201d In other words, watch out Arcadia! Property Week agree that the vote of Land Securities (one of the UK\u2019s largest commercial property firms) will be crucial today. They say: Landsec holds Arcadia\u2019s survival in its hands for the second week in a row. Even if the commercial property giant abstains, that is expected to be enough to give Sir Philip Green victory. Arcadia remains hopeful that landlords will approve its CVA deal today, at the second time of asking. One insider told Retail Week: \u201cArcadia wouldn\u2019t take it to a vote tomorrow if it wasn\u2019t hopeful of getting it over the line. It would have pulled the plug and gone into administration instead.\u201d The threat of administration looks like Green\u2019s best weapon. He can tell landlords that their choice is lower rent, or no rent at all. However, this ultimatum rather lost its force last Wednesday when Arcadia delayed the CVA vote in the face of defeat, rather than plunge into administration. That handed power to the landlords, forcing Sir Phil to put more his family\u2019s money into the deal. With Arcadia\u2019s future up in the air, shoppers would be wise to check their purses and wallets for any gift cards from Top Shop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Should the company fall into administration, such cards might be hard to redeem: With shopping centre owner INTU opposing the Arcadia structuring, the position of other landlords is now crucial. Land Securities, which owns 12 24 Arcadia outlets, is a crucial \u2018swing voter\u2019, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: The likelihood of M&amp;G backing the deal looked slim on Tuesday night after it emerged that the investment company was taking legal action against Debenhams\u2019 CVA which was approved by creditors last month. However, there were rumours that Aviva was now prepared to back the deal while others, including the Crown Estate, Land Securities and Aberdeen Standard were still wavering. The position of Land Securities, one of the most significant waverers, was also unclear on Tuesday night. Land Securities owns shopping centres including Bluewater in Kent, and One New Change in the City of London. Sources at one major landlord said they did not think the revised offer was enough and that there was a strong chance the deal would fail. \u201cThere was no consultation before [the new deal was put out]. It was \u2018that\u2019s it and we\u2019re off\u2019 \u2026 It feels pretty close,\u201d the source said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire, and the jobs of 18,000 staff, hang in the balance this morning. The landlords who own Arcadia\u2019s stores across the UK are heading to central London to vote on whether to accept a restructuring plan that will lead to hundreds of job cuts and scores of store closures. If they reject the offer, then Arcadia could sink into administration - one of the biggest retail failures for years. Today\u2019s vote is extremely close. We know that because Green was forced to dramatically halt a vote on this Company Voluntary Arrangement a week ago -- once it became clear that landlords weren\u2019t playing ball. Green has been working the phones since (his famous old Nokia handset must be red hot), trying to twist landlords\u2019 arms to approve the plan. He has also been forced to sweeten the original deal -- reducing the rent cuts which landlords were being asked to swallow. They now face a hit of 25%-50%, down from 30% to 70% before. But it may not be enough! Property group INTU has indicated it will oppose the CVA deal again today. That\u2019s bad news for Green - INTU owns 35 Arcadia stores, or around 15% of the vote. Arcadia needs 75% support to get the restructuring deal over the line, so One INTU source argues that Arcadia\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t fair. Arcadia is asking for a significant discount on valuable space, and Intu is not prepared to give way.
