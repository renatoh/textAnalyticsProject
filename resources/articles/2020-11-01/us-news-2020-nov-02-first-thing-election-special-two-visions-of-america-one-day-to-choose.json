More than 93 million Americans have already cast their ballot in the 2020 presidential election, which is more than two-thirds of the total turnout in 2016. In Texas and Hawaii, early voting numbers have already surpassed the total vote four years ago. Yet with just 24 hours to go until election day, and even with the polls still stubbornly in Joe Biden\u2019s favour, the results \u2013 and their timing \u2013 remain unpredictable. Criss-crossing the swing states for our Anywhere but Washington series, Oliver Laughland has met voters with two very different \u2013 and apparently irreconcilable \u2013 visions for the future of America. It is a measure of the volatility of this election that at least one reporter has requested a bullet-proof vest to cover its aftermath, writes the Guardian US editor, John Mulholland: It\u2019s not just paramilitaries and threats of violence which are causing us to prepare differently for this election. Ordinarily we would expect an election result \u2013 at the latest \u2013 in the early hours of Wednesday morning. That could still happen, assuming a very decisive victory for either party. But, as almost everyone now knows, this election result may not be known for days, or even weeks, such is the number of people voting by mail. You can get instant results delivered to your phone on election day \u2013 and beyond \u2013 with the Guardian\u2019s live-updating app alert. Here\u2019s how to sign up. Trump says he\u2019s \u2018going in with the lawyers\u2019 to claim the election Donald Trump began a sprint through the swing states on Sunday, with 10 rallies planned in seven states over the last two days of the campaign. Axios reported that the president plans to declare victory on election night \u201cif it looks like he is \u2018ahead\u2019\u201d, to counter a potential \u201cblue shift\u201d in votes counted after Tuesday. Trump denied the report, but warned: \u201cAs soon as the election is over, we\u2019re going in with our lawyers.\u201d While the president has so far failed to articulate a coherent manifesto, his critics have a pretty good idea what Americans could expect from a second Trump term, writes David Smith: \u201cWidening chasms between rich and poor, justice and racism, truth and lies.\u201d For the latest edition of the Today in Focus podcast, Chris McGreal asked several voters who swung behind Trump in 2016 why they\u2019re sticking with him in 2020. Trump\u2019s own efforts to spread election disinformation have done more to undermine faith in US democracy in 2020 than foreign interference by the likes of Russia and Iran, as Julia Carrie Wong reports. Sean Connery did not help Trump to get planning applications approved for a golf course in Scotland, contrary to the president\u2019s claims, though the late actor did publicly voice his approval for the project. Dozens of historians of authoritarianism have signed a letter warning democracy is \u201cwithering or in full-scale collapse globally.\u201d The experts disagree on whether to label Trump a \u201cfascist,\u201d but they warned: The temptation to take refuge in a figure of arrogant strength is now greater than ever. An Iowa poll rattles Democrats, but Harris stumps in Texas For many Biden supporters, the specter of 2016 looms large \u2013 which is why a new poll of Iowa released on Saturday sent some into a panic. The Selzer &amp; Co survey showed Trump with a seven-point lead: the same margin he enjoyed over Hillary Clinton, in the same poll, days before he beat her by 9.4% in the Hawkeye state and clinched the presidency. That poll remains an outlier, however \u2013 and in a state Trump was already expected to retain. Biden spent the weekend in more vulnerable swing states, while his running mate, Kamala Harris, was on the stump in Texas, suggesting Democrats still think they could flip the nation\u2019s second-biggest electoral college prize. Daniel Strauss and Lauren Gambino look back on a campaign that came close to collapse during the primaries, but is now within reach of the White House. In other election news \u2026 Convoys of Trump supporters have taken to roads across several US cities, as the FBI investigates an incident in which the drivers of a \u201cTrump train\u201d swarmed a Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway and were praised by Trump as \u201cpatriots\u201d. Trump has threatened to fire Anthony Fauci after the election. The administration\u2019s top Covid expert warned in a Washington Post interview this weekend that the US is \u201cin for a whole lot of hurt\u201d from the pandemic over the winter months. Stat of the day The Texas supreme court has rejected a Republican request to toss out almost 127,000 ballots cast at drive-through voting places in Harris County, Texas \u2013 a vast Democratic stronghold that comprises much of the city of Houston. A federal judge is expected to rule on the same issue on Monday, and could come to a different decision, voting rights activists have warned. Conservative activists claim counting the ballots from the drive-through locations, which were set up to allow safe voting amid the coronavirus pandemic, would \u201ccall into question the integrity and legality of a federal election.\u201d View from the right Many of Jonah Goldberg\u2019s fellow conservative commentators have already written pieces explaining why they won\u2019t vote for Trump. Instead of adding another to the pile, writes Goldberg for the Dispatch, he is offering a prediction \u2013 Trump will lose \u2013 and an explanation: Thanks to his inability to let go of the 2016 mindset combined with his belief that the single best thing about his presidency was him\u2014not his policies, not his accomplishments, just him\u2014he didn\u2019t think he needed to promise anything concrete for his second term other than more him. Don\u2019t miss this Amid one of the most consequential presidential elections in memory, it is easy to overlook the local races that are also on the ballot this year. But as David Daley explains, the make-up of legislatures in Texas, Wisconsin, North Carolina and several other states will determine how their electoral maps are redrawn \u2013 and potentially gerrymandered \u2013 after the 2020 census. And that will shape the electoral college for at least the next decade. Last Thing: an intellectual history of the Trump era Book reviewer Carlos Lozada has made a study of 150 often trashy tomes written about the Trump presidency, and from it produced his own intellectual history of the past four years. His book, What Were We Thinking, is \u201can utter marvel,\u201d says Peter Conrad: \u201cSober though frequently very funny, fairer minded than the subject deserves, in the end profoundly troubling even as it looks ahead to America\u2019s recovery from the Trump malaise.\u201d Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
