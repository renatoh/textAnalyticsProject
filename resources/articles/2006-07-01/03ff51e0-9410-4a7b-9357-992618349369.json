A statement issued by McLaren suggested that the two sides had agreed to an immediate parting of the ways only a day after Montoya announced that he would switch to the American Nascar stock-car category for 2007. His place in Sunday's French grand prix at Magny-Cours will be taken by the team's test driver Pedro de la Rosa, but their British test driver Gary Paffett may yet be given his race debut before the end of the season. \"We have agreed that with so many things happening in Juan Pablo's life right now he should take some time out of the car and prepare professionally and personally for the future,\" said McLaren's chief executive Ron Dennis. The team refused to comment on speculation that Montoya's departure was because the Colombian was in breach of contract in announcing his Nascar deal without previously informing the McLaren management."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
