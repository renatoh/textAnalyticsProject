But the reasons for that growth combined with the latest investment figures would do little to have workers cheering. Last week the latest private new capital expenditure figures were released showing that the amount of investment in building, structure, machinery and equipment once again declined \u2013 down 4.8% in the September quarter and down 15.6% over the past 12 months. The decline of course was driven by falling investment in the mining industry. This is not a shock. Pointing out that mining investment is falling is about as stunning as suggesting the next Star Wars movie might make a bit of money. The fall of investment in the mining industry has now entered its fourth year \u2013 the peak was way back in September 2012: And while the investment in the non-mining sector is improving slightly, it is by no means enough to make up for the drop in the mining sector: It\u2019s always worth remembering that just because investment in the mining industry has collapsed, that doesn\u2019t mean the mining industry itself has. The industry is actually going gangbusters. While mining investment has fallen 62% since September 2012, output by the industry has grown 32% in the same time (and output by the iron ore sector is up 70%) \u2013 well beyond the 10% increase in Australia\u2019s GDP. But that output is driven by exports of mining, rather than by investment. The investment in the sector was mostly for the building of the mine and the structures \u2013 road, rail etc needed for those mines: And those buildings and structure required a lot of labour. And this brings us to the ABS\u2019s release on Monday of its annual estimates of industry multi-factor productivity. Multi-factor productivity attempts to measure how well labour makes use of capital to produce their output. In 2015-16 in the market sector (ie not counting the public sector), multi-factor productivity grew by 0.9% \u2013 the fifth straight year of improving productivity: During the mining boom years, while our GDP was growing well above average, our productivity growth was as bad as it had ever been. It was the cause of much angst among economists and policymakers. It was one of the justifications for the Howard government introducing WorkChoices in 2006. But the biggest reason for the decline in productivity growth was the actual boom in mining investment. The soaring prices for iron ore meant mining companies were falling over themselves to build new mines, and that meant investing in a lot of capital and employing a lot of labour in order to produce its output. In 2005, 2006 and 2007 \u2013 when the mining boom was at its height \u2013 the mining industry increased investment on average by 45% each year, while annual output growth averaged 5.5%. In the past three years, while investment has fallen on average by 20% each year, output has increased by 7.8%. It meant that during those mining boom years, despite very strong output growth, productivity was falling: The mining and the electricity, gas and water industries were the two big drags on national productivity \u2013 mining due to the massive investment in new mines, and the electricity sector due to the massive investment (some would argue overinvestment) in the electricity network. The latest figures show just how poorly productivity performed in those two industries compared with the rest of the economy: But now, great news! Productivity in the mining industry is on the improve \u2013 up 9.7% in the past two years (the best of any industry) \u2013 and productivity in the electricity and gas industry is also on the improve. But why this has occurred is a perfect encapsulation of why people feel disconnected with economic policies. Productivity is something that is good for the economy and good for people\u2019s lives. If we are able to produce more with the same amount of labour then that means (all other things being equal) that our standard of living will improve. If we are unable to improve our productivity then the only way our income can improve is if the price for the things we produce goes up. But productivity growth can equally come from producing more or even the same amount, but with a smaller amount of labour. And this is what we are seeing occur at the moment. In the past two years, for example, the five industries which have seen the level of \u201clabour inputs\u201d (essentially hours worked) grow the most, have all seen their multi-factor productivity decline. Conversely, all of the five industries whose labour inputs have gone down have seen their multi-factor productivity increase. And the mining industry which has reduced its labour input the most also has the best productivity growth: Ideally of course you want to see both labour and productivity increase, and that did occur in four industries over the past two years \u2013 led by the information media and telecommunication industry which had the sixth biggest increase in labour inputs and the fourth biggest productivity improvement. But even there, the news is not great as most of the productivity growth came from 2015-16, which coincided with a 2% fall in labour input. It\u2019s why when economists speak of productivity improvements they think of standard of living, national income and GDP per capita growth, but when workers hear it they are much more likely to think, cuts to jobs and hours worked. And given the data, they are right to think that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
