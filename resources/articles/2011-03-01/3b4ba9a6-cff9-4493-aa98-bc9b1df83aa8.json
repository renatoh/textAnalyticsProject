The Wolves were forced to call up Evans \u2013 a tall, blond 18-year-old from Bridgend \u2013 because three of their senior three-quarters were out injured. The result was breathtaking, as Evans offered a first glimpse of the potential that has excited Warrington insiders since he moved north with his twin brother, Ben \u2013 a prop (they are anything but identical) \u2013 early in their teens. He scored one try and made another for Richie Myler with classic pieces of centre play as the Wolves overturned an early 8-0 deficit to take a 34-8 lead early in the second half. British rugby league has suffered from such a shortage of back-line talent in recent years that there is a danger of getting prematurely carried away by such a performance. But it is already easy to see why the England coach, Steve McNamara, was so keen to persuade the Evans boys to choose their adopted country over Wales at under-18s level last year. \"He's a good boy, isn't he?\" said the Wolves coach, Tony Smith. \"We've all been a bit excited by him for some time, biding our time and bringing him through. Obviously he caught the eye with some of his attacking play, but defensively he made some decisions that were way beyond his age.\" The only blot on an excellent night for Smith, which followed his team's landmark away win against St Helens last Friday, was a knee injury that forced the withdrawal of Adrian Morley inside 15 minutes. But whereas Warrington shrugged off the absence of their captain, Leeds failed miserably to deal with the loss of their hooker, Danny Buderus, with a broken nose soon afterwards. \"That affected us,\" said their coach, Brian McDermott. But conceding 76 points in consecutive games after last week's shock home defeat by Harlequins was, he admitted, \"not good enough\". They had made a promising start with Kallum Watkins, another exciting young centre, playing opposite Evans, rounding off a move featuring two sublime Kevin Sinfield passes to score an 11th-minute try. But the game turned on a sloppy handling error from Ali Lauitiiti from the kick-off following Sinfield's subsequent penalty. He was punished by Evans's try, an excellent finish after he had been given space by Brett Hodgson's pressure pass. Lee Briers and Myler scored further Wolves tries, with Evans handling twice in the build-up to the latter. The killer blow came in first-half stoppage time, and again Leeds had only themselves to blame. This time it was a bad error by the wing Ryan Hall deep inside his own half that conceded possession, allowing Michael Monaghan to chip for Chris Riley to score. Worryingly for Leeds, there was no sign of the necessary response in the second half until it was far too late. Simon Grix and Joel Monaghan added further tries to extend Warrington's lead to 34-8 and late tries for Brent Webb and a late double for Hall produced a respectable final scoreline that will fool no one at Headingley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
