In his annual address, written a month after he underwent emergency heart surgery, Jamie Dimon said that at the very least a severe downturn was on its way coupled with financial pressures reminiscent of the banking crash more than a decade ago. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future will hold \u2013 but at a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.\u201d He said JP Morgan had not asked for any government support and would continue lending money, while offering greater forbearance for customers struggling to repay debts. But he admitted that even Wall Street\u2019s largest bank \u201ccannot be immune\u201d to the economic turmoil and could be forced to suspend the dividend it pays to shareholders. The banker has previously clashed with Donald Trump after claiming that he could beat the president in an election. And Dimon appeared to criticise the Trump administration\u2019s lack of readiness for the outbreak. \u201cThere should have been a pandemic playbook,\u201d said Dimon. But he also pointed to much deeper, structural problems in US society that he said were contributing to the danger presented by coronavirus. \u201cOf course, America has always had its flaws,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cThe current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country.\u201d Dimon, whose cash-plus-stock pay package was worth $31.5m (\u00a325.6m) last year, highlighted worsening wealth inequality as one of America\u2019s biggest problems, citing the fact that the share of wages for the bottom 30% of US citizens has been declining. The JP Morgan boss also lamented poor outcomes in education, a costly healthcare system that many people cannot access, the lack of a social safety net and a poor immigration policy. \u201cWe need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them,\u201d said Dimon, who returned to work this year after heart surgery. \u201cAs we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we \u2013 at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humanitarian organisations \u2013 could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.\u201d JP Morgan reported profits of $36.4bn last year and Dimon said the bank could survive and keep lending, even if its most pessimistic scenarios for the effect of the pandemic on the global economy came to pass. But its dividend could be suspended in the \u201cextremely adverse scenario\u201d in which the US economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter and unemployment hits 14% by the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
