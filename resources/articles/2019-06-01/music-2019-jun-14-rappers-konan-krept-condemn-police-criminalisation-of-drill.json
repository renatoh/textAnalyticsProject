Krept and Konan\u2019s petition on Change.org references the case of Skengdo and AM, who make drill \u2013 the darker, often bellicose sub-genre of rap music that originated in Chicago in the early 2010s before becoming popular in the UK. Skengdo and AM were sentenced to nine months in prison in December for performing their song Attempted 1.0 at a London concert in breach of a \u201cgang injunction\u201d that banned the group from doing so because it was linked to \u201cgang-related violence\u201d. The petition calls the decision the beginning of \u201ca clampdown on free speech for rappers\u201d. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t get into serious crime lightly,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThey do so because of serious social problems \u2026 that is what\u2019s driving the escalation of violence on London\u2019s streets. The soundtrack is irrelevant.\u201d Speaking at the launch of their video Ban Drill, Krept and Konan said the song was inspired by Skengdo and AM\u2019s legal battle over their music, and that criminalising music would hold back a new generation of artists. \u201cThey\u2019re stopping the next Krept and Konan, the next Stormzy, the next Skepta,\u201d Konan said. \u201cYou\u2019re stopping the potential. There\u2019s not really many avenues to get off the street, music is the main one. When you stop that, you limit people.\u201d Rapman, who directed the video, said: \u201cWould you rather have these so-called \u2018bad kids\u2019 on the street or in the studio? The police think that they need to do something, so they decide to try and ban the music. They\u2019re doing more damage than good.\u201d Konan said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the roads and you\u2019re doing this, no one wants to be doing it. No one wants to go to jail or get stabbed. That\u2019s just the environment you\u2019re in. When you\u2019re doing music, touring and going to the Brits, do you think you\u2019ll be thinking about committing crime or going back to that life? Of course not.\u201d The petition also refers to police use of the Serious Crime Act, which established the Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO), a civil order nicknamed the \u201cgangster asbo\u201d, which has also been used to target terrorist suspects. \u201cWe are asking you to stop the police from being able to ban drill music by using the Serious Crime Act to prosecute artists,\u201d it reads. The two rappers believe attempts to stop drill acts playing their songs continue a pattern, after police use of form 696, a controversial risk assessment that promoters and venues had to fill in from 2005 to 2017. It was scrapped after accusations that it was being used to racially profile urban music nights. Konan wrote about the life-changing effect music had for him in a comment piece for the Guardian on Thursday. \u201cBefore music, there was just jail, gangs and getting arrested,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWithout music, I do not know if I would be alive today. Best-case scenario, I\u2019d be in prison.\u201d He was also critical of police attempts to gag drill musicians. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just another version of stop and search, targeting a group of people without justification for a crime that hasn\u2019t actually happened.\u201d Krept and Konan\u2019s comments echo the open letter signed by Liberty which called the injunction against Skengdo and AM \u201cdemonstrably ineffective at tackling youth violence\u201d. The civil rights group said it presented \u201ca threat to all our civil liberties\u201d that prevented young people from discussing \u201cthe reality of their lives with any hope of being heard\u201d. AM told the Guardian in January that he did not believe preventing certain songs being played would stop violence. \u201cIt\u2019s PR [for the police],\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been to this area, and you know there\u2019s a crime problem because you read about it, it makes the police look like they\u2019re doing something.\u201d YouTube has removed 30 drill music videos from its site after requests from the Metropolitan police. The force\u2019s commissioner, Cressida Dick, said disputes conducted by young people on social media can escalate quickly and violently. Krept and Konan are the latest rappers to speak out about drill. Giggs criticised the Sun last August for its coverage of the murder of the drill rapper Siddique Kamara, AKA Incognito, who was stabbed to death in Camberwell, south London. The tabloid\u2019s front page claimed the DJ Tim Westwood and YouTube, which hosts drill videos, \u201cprofit from death\u201d. Kamara had featured on Westwood\u2019s video channel with his drill group Moscow17. \u201cIt\u2019s strange how when our music gets popular we make your shit newspaper,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cBlack yutes were dying weekly and barely made the south London press, and what a surprise that it\u2019s not about a kid losing his life, it\u2019s just some bullshit story you made up about profit and Westwood.\u201d Five members of the west London group 1011 were issued with a court order earlier in 2018 that banned them from making music without police permission. The group have to notify police within 24 hours of releasing videos and give 48 hours\u2019 warning of the date and location of any performance or recording, and let officers attend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
