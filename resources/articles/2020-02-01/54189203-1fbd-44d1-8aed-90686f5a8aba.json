Guaid\u00f3, who has spent the last year battling \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 to topple Maduro, arrived at the White House on Wednesday afternoon and was met by Trump. Earlier, a senior administration official told reporters to expect the moves against Maduro in the next 30 days, without specifying what form they might take. \u201cWe are probably halfway to what maximum pressure [on Maduro] could look like,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are only moving in one direction and that is forwards.\u201d The official said Trump instructed all parts of the US government \u201cto use all of the tools at their disposal to further create stress upon Maduro and his cronies\u201d. But Guaid\u00f3\u2019s t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Trump was overshadowed by Mitt Romney\u2019s announcement that he would vote for the US president\u2019s impeachment. As that news broke, journalists were abruptly excluded from a planned Oval Office encounter between Trump and Guaid\u00f3 by the White House press office, without immediate explanation. The previous evening Trump had used his State of the Union address to offer Guaid\u00f3 a high-profile show of support. As Guaid\u00f3 looked on from the gallery, Trump declared him \u201cthe true and legitimate president of Venezuela\u201d leading a \u201crighteous struggle for freedom\u201d. \u201cMaduro is an illegitimate ruler \u2026 but Maduro\u2019s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken,\u201d Trump vowed to loud applause from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. In a clear sign of how Trump sees Venezuela as an important element of his 2020 presidential campaign, he added: \u201cSocialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\u201d Observers described Trump\u2019s public blessing as a triumph for Guaid\u00f3, who defied a travel ban to leave Venezuela last month and is concluding a world tour which also included meetings with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau. \u201cI think it\u2019s huge for Guaid\u00f3,\u201d said Guillermo Zubillaga, a Venezuela specialist at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. \u201cIt erases all the doubts about his leadership \u2026 it unites people around him and it emboldens him. I don\u2019t know how this trip could have been more successful.\u201d Vanessa Neumann, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to the United Kingdom, said Trump\u2019s statement of \u201cvery solid\u201d support would also shield Guaid\u00f3 from arrest when he tried to return to Venezuela in the coming days. The senior administration official said Maduro would face \u201cvery significant consequences\u201d if Guaid\u00f3 was harmed. But many analysts question what concrete impact Trump\u2019s words will have on Guaid\u00f3\u2019s faltering campaign to force out Maduro. Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a top Venezuelan pollster, said Guaid\u00f3 could certainly consider Trump\u2019s backing a victory. But it was now crucial for Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 whose domestic popularity has slumped since he launched his campaign for change in January 2019 \u2013 to return home with concrete results such as increased US pressure on Maduro\u2019s key allies, China and Russia. \u201cIf you return with nothing new, if you cannot convert potential energy into kinetic energy, you fall back into decline. And this is a terrible danger for the opposition\u2019s ability to sustain itself in the future,\u201d said Le\u00f3n. Le\u00f3n, the head of the Caracas-based polling group Datan\u00e1lisis, said Venezuelan politics was like an old-fashioned sugar mill: \u201cIt removes your juice and then discards you. If you don\u2019t do something different, you\u2019ll get put through the crusher. And whether you end up as bagazo [pulp] in Caracas or in Miami, [it\u2019s the] same shit.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 has offered no hint of what \u2013 if any \u2013 additional support his allies may have offered during his tour. But during a rally in Miami on Saturday he told supporters \u201call options are on the table \u2013 but also underneath it too\u201d. Maduro\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, slammed Trump\u2019s \u201cdelusional and arrogant\u201d remarks, dismissing them as part of an attempt to revive his moribund regime change strategy for Venezuela."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
