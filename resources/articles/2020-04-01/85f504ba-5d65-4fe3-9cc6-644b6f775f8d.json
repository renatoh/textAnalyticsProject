So how does this compare to the UK\u2019s wettest month on record: October 1903? The records show that 227mm of rain fell during October 1903, but the observations are not detailed enough to show precisely where and when the most intense rainfall occurred. That\u2019s because thousands of meticulous weather observations are recorded in copperplate hand-writing, but haven\u2019t yet made it to digital form. Now they have! A call for volunteers to use Covid-19 lockdown time to help rescue rainfall records has resulted in over 15,000 people transcribing all five million UK rainfall measurements recorded between 1820 and 1960, in the space of just three weeks. Once the data has been double checked scientists will be able to compare exceptional months like October 1903 and February 2020, and understand the variation in British weather. Meanwhile, more data awaits. \u201cThe next project will be at sea, looking at ship weather logbooks,\u201d says Ed Hawkins, who leads the Weather Rescue project."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
