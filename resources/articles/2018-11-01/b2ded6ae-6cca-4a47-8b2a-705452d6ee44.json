This time, he joked, he would have to up the ante for a side that have conceded 31 goals in 12 Premier League games this season. \u201cI have to promise something more,\u201d he said. \u201cPizza is not enough now. Better everybody to McDonald\u2019s! I hope to pay for a McDonald\u2019s big burger very soon!\u201d There was, of course, a serious message behind the laughs. Fulham have lost six league games on the spin (seven in all competitions), are three points from a safe position, and have a defence more leaky than the Trump White House. This was the politest of warnings from Ranieri, who replaced Slavisa Jokanovic on Wednesday, that things would have to change \u2013 and fast. \u201cFulham concede a lot of goals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an Italian manager. For us Italians it\u2019s important to maintain the clean sheet. This team has enough quality to be safe. But I need fighting spirit too. Play football, play well. But when you lose the ball I want to see you with an anchor, like pirates. I have fought for everything. I am a fighter. I want my players to be fighters \u2013 that is it. It is simple.\u201d And Ranieri made it clear that improving Fulham\u2019s defensive shield will start with his star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who never appeared entirely happy being asked to harry and hustle by Rafa Ben\u00edtez at Newcastle. \u201cFor me Mitrovic is a fantastic player,\u201d explained Ranieri. \u201cWe have to give him some good balls so he can score. I watched him in the national team and score a lot of goals. He is very important. And I think from him we have very good things. But I have to choose the best way not only for him but for everybody, for the first XI.\u201d Inevitably such an approach, he warned spectators, meant his side might have to shun some of the free-flowing style under Jokanovic in favour of winning ugly. \u201cI hope we can play well, but if we play well and lose it\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Ranieri admitted. \u201cFulham played so well against Manchester City and Liverpool and lost. I hope to play badly and win.\u201d Yet as he pointed out, he has got teams out of worse scrapes in his 32-year managerial career \u2013 particularly when he took over at Parma in February 2007. \u201cWhen I arrived, I called my friends and they said: \u2018You are mad to go there \u2013 it\u2019s not possible to save this team.\u2019 And I saved the team.\u201d That Parma team won 17 points in the final 10 Serie A games to survive the drop, and earn Ranieri the manager\u2019s job at Juventus. And his friends are firm believers that he can work his particular brand of magic again. \u201cEverybody has said good choice, good club, historical club, magical club,\u201d he added. \u201cThey all said: \u2018Come on Claudio, you can do it\u2019.\u201d Inevitably there were also questions about his time at Leicester, who he guided to an impossible Premier League title as 5,000-1 shots in 2016. However, even at 67 Ranieri insisted that he only wanted to look forward. \u201cOne quality I have is to forget what happened yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI look always forward. I\u2019m an ambitious man. I believe I have good players. Now I have to choose players who show fighting spirit, quality and unity.\u201d It helps that Ranieri still has a house in west London from his time at Chelsea, and he seemed instantly at home at Fulham, which he called a \u201clittle big club\u201d. But there were no grand promises to win the Premier League again \u2013 merely a hard-hatted acceptance that he wanted to get to 40 points and keep Fulham up as quickly as possible. \u201cThat season at Leicester was a bonus, a fairytale I forget,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s important not to think about the miracle. There will be a lot of battles ahead and it\u2019s important to be ready together. The club, the players and the fans, together. They have to support us in a bad moment. And this is a bad moment, because Fulham is at the bottom. \u201cBut when the manager changes, life is new, everybody wants to show their best. For me it\u2019s important they understand me, just one man, my philosophy.\u201d Yet Ranieri, who resembles a likeable buzz of caffeine and charm, is confident he can turn things around \u2013 once he gets to work on the training pitch. \u201cI\u2019m only thinking about when the players come back from the international break,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI just have two days to prepare for the match [against Southampton]. My nightmare is this. To think about how I can help my players. That\u2019s it. \u201cBut I am very happy to come back, the country of football. To me it is the best league of the world. It is difficult, very difficult. But I love this job.\u201d There was no mistaking the enthusiasm \u2013 or the intent. Ranieri is back. And the Premier League is undoubtedly a more interesting place for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
