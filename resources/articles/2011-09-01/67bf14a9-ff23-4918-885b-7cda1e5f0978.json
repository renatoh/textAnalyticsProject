England could not have wished for a more comfortable start to their attempt to qualify for a fourth successive European Under-21 Championship as they disposed of Azerbaijan with ease, but there was nothing here to suggest that they will fare any better in the 2013 finals in Israel, if they get there, than they did during June's dispiriting performance in the 2011 tournament. There was no great influx of ingenuity against Azerbaijan, little attempt to conjure in cramped spaces. Then again, there did not need to be to beat these visitors. England's power and directness sufficed. With far tougher opposition awaiting in this group \u2013 Belgium, Norway and Iceland \u2013 the result was what mattered to the manager, Stuart Pearce. \"We couldn't afford to drop points,\" he said. \"We'll need at least 17 points from the 24 available to even have a chance of qualifying for the finals.\" For all that the lack of intricacy was to be lamented, given that it had been the team's downfall in Denmark, at least there were some splendid goals to admire, along with a couple of encouraging individuals displays. England's defence was the one part of the team to impress in Denmark but with players such as Chris Smalling and Phil Jones having outgrown this level, the rearguard was the focus of most of Pearce's rebuilding here, with three of the four players starting for the first time being defenders and the other the goalkeeper, Jack Butland of Birmingham City. It did not take long for one of them to make an impact: in the fourth minute the West Bromwich Albion centre-back Craig Dawson stomped forward to head Henri Lansbury's corner into the net. Dawson reprised that feat in the last minute, to crown the victory he had initiated. Lansbury also impressed. The 21-year-old appears unloved at Arsenal, for whom he has made just three appearances since 2006. This week he was loaned out to West Ham, the fourth club to have borrowed him in recent seasons. In June he came on as a substitute in all of England's matches in Denmark without affecting them but here, at last, he thrived. He demonstrated fine technique when he scored England's second goal in the 21st minute, turning Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross into the net with an acrobatic volley. The pair combined successfully again in the 73rd minute, Lansbury neatly slotting into the net from 15 yards after Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross had sparked chaos in the opposition box. That brace were Lansbury's first goals in his 10th appearance at this level. \"Henri has come of age,\" said Pearce. \"Some players take longer than others to make their mark at this level and he's one of those. He matured a lot during the Euros, where he trained very hard, and now he's really ready to push on.\" Between Lansbury's two goals, Jordan Henderson had scored England's third, curling the ball sumptuously into the net from the corner of the box. The limitations of the visitors meant England's occasionally sloppy passing went unpunished and the only time Butland was give a chance to shine was in the 55th minute, when he reacted smartly to parry a close-range header from Johan Ozkara after an inswinging free-kick by Mirhuseyn Seyidov. Watford's Marvin Sordell was introduced for the ineffective Nathan Delfouneso in the 67th minute and had a prime chance to delight the crowd of more than 7,000 when presented with a one-on-one in the 71st minute, but he shot just wide. Another substitute, Martyn Waghorn \u2013 who replaced the disappointing Connor Wickham \u2013 did much better in the 76th minute when he struck a spectacular fifth goal, booming the ball into the net from 30 yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
