Connections will make a decision about Epsom after the colt's next outing which is likely to be the Tote Dante Stakes at York tomorrow week. In an important week for the in-form David Elsworth stable the trainer could also throw up a second possible Derby candidate in Foodbrooker Founder, who is likely to take his chance in the Bet Attheraces Derby Trial at Lingfield on Saturday. Reflecting on Norse Dancer's fine effort at 100-1 to chase home Refuse To Bend and Zafeen at Newmarket, Elsworth said: \"It's a question of whether we keep him to a mile and go for the Irish Guineas or try further at York and if that was the case and he pleases us he could be supplemented into the Derby. \"One had to be pleased with his performance but he had been giving us good signals at home and while you can question the value of the form it's rare that the Guineas fails to hold up in the fullness of time.\" Elsworth added that Foodbroker Founder, a colt by Groom Dancer, would take his chance at Lingfield and had pleased him since his own comeback outing. The stable's evergreen stayer Persian Punch will not run in the Emirates Airline Yorkshire Cup at York next week and will instead go to Newbury the following weekend for the Aston Park Stakes, a Listed race over a mile and five furlongs. Elsworth has had to wait longer than usual to bring back the huge Persian Punch who did very well out at grass and this race is being viewed as a stepping stone towards the Ascot Gold Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
