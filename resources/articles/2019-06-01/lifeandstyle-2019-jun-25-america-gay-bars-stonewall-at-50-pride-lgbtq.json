Fifty years after the Stonewall Inn in New York became the symbol for a new wave of gay activism, the three horsemen of the gay bar apocalypse \u2013 gentrification, assimilation and technology \u2013 have hollowed out their numbers. Rising rents have shuttered gay bars; more straight venues are \u201caccepting\u201d of gay patrons; and dating is something people now do with their phones. Even the term \u201cgay bar\u201d looks a little tired as the LGBTQ community finally comes to terms with its many rainbow stripes. Bare numbers are hard to come by, but Yelp calculates the number of gay bars listed on its service fell 16% between 2014 and 2018. It now represents just 0.8% of all bar listings. But across America \u2013 and especially in less progressive states and communities \u2013 the gay bar is as vibrant and vital as it has ever been. It\u2019s a rallying point in times of trial and celebration. It is the pumping heart of a community that, as the Trump administration rolls back its rights, needs its own space more than it has in years. The oasis: Wonderlust in Jackson, Mississippi You can find Wonderlust, the only gay bar in Jackson, Mississippi, on the northern edge of town, just past the Piggly Wiggly supermarket and the duelling discount stores Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Housed in a long, black, squat building, Wonderlust is marked by panels painted in a sort of rainbow flag. The colours are off \u2013 hospital green, shop-soiled peach, sun-bleached eggplant \u2013 as if picked from a paint store\u2019s remainder bin. It\u2019s not much to look at, but a bar on this spot has been a haven for Mississippi\u2019s LGBTQ community for more than 25 years. Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the US. A majority still disagree with same-sex marriage \u2013 one of just two states \u2013 the other is Alabama \u2013 to still hold that view. A few years ago, a Mississippi pastor even brought a horse in a wedding dress to the federal courthouse to protest against gay marriage. State law means businesses can deny service to queer people if doing so would conflict with their \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs. Gay people here are mostly discreet. Either that or they leave the state. So Wonderlust has become the one public place where they feel safe to be themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate in the world,\u201d says Jodi Sullivan, a trans woman and a Wonderlust regular. \u201cIt\u2019s either come here or sit at home.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Bible belt. Everybody isn\u2019t as accepting of us as other places,\u201d says Drew Gully-Luckett, who, along with his husband John-Corey, is in the process of taking over the bar. Even going out for dinner together in Jackson can have its issues. \u201cIf we sit on the same side of the booth, people will look at us funny,\u201d says Gully-Luckett. \u201cWe don\u2019t hold hands.\u201d A few years ago, protesters picketed the bar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a large group,\u201d he says, casually. \u201cJust\u201d 10 to 12 men outside in jacked-up trucks, one with a Confederate flag, \u201cyelling Bible verses and telling us we are going to hell, and if we talk to them we\u2019ll be forgiven\u201d. I tell him that sounds terrifying. He shrugs: \u201cIf you just ignore them, there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d There are no protests tonight, but as we walk in, a man approaches us asking that we not take his picture or identify him. A prominent sign on the door says the Guardian is filming and interviewing people. He\u2019s a government worker in his 30s. \u201cThey don\u2019t know I\u2019m out,\u201d he says. Inside, everyone is out \u2013 at least for a good time. Wonderlust is a riot of inclusivity. The crowd is young, old, black, white, Hispanic, trans, straight, gay, lesbian, undecided. The music is pumping, there\u2019s a drag show, dancing, laughing, more drinking, pool tables. By 11pm on Saturday, there isn\u2019t a space left on the car park. If there\u2019s a better time to be had for a hundred miles, good luck finding it. But there\u2019s also a layer of sadness draped over this southern charm. Mississippi is stuck in the past. Many of the patrons said they would move if not for financial or family ties. \u201cBeing black and gay in the south \u2013 it\u2019s rough,\u201d says Michael Johnson, a regular who drives close to an hour to come to Wonderlust. And yet he\u2019s hopeful about the future. \u201cThe south has come a long way,\u201d he says. \u201cI see a change. It\u2019s slow, but it\u2019s a change,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard.\u201d He continues: \u201cWhen I first discovered Wonderlust, it was like a burden was lifted off. It gave me a place to come where I could really let go and be myself. It was a place where I felt comfortable enough to be myself and in this damn time you need that.\u201d The LGBTQ community has achieved major victories in recent years, but Curt Sullivan-Ellis, a tall, handsome bearded man in a checked shirt who is also the drag queen London DuMore, says life has got worse under Trump.Legislators in Mississippi have felt empowered to chip away at hard-won rights, he says, and that message has not been lost on the haters. \u201cI feel sometimes I could be attacked,\u201d he says. \u201cI see a lot more hatred. Especially on Facebook. These feelings, they\u2019ve had them forever but now they can come out and talk about it.\u201d Not here, he says: Wonderlust \u201cgives us a place to be without fear or judgment\u201d. The institution: the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas Back in 1986, when Gary Miller and Alan Pierce first started working at the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas, same-sex couples were not allowed to dance together. \u201cIf the police came in, everybody would stop dancing and hang out until they left,\u201d Miller remembers. People were afraid to park their cars close to the bar; cops would take people\u2019s license plate numbers and turn them in to their employers \u2013 which, back in the early days, would mean an automatic termination. How things have changed. At least at Round-Up. Today, the club holds dance classes almost nightly. People from across the state \u2013 and the world \u2013 come to watch cowboys do the Texas two-step. \u201cCowboys can be gay too,\u201d says Miller, with a twinkle in his eye. So strong is the pull of the bar that Lady Gaga visits pretty much every time she\u2019s in town. (\u201cWe have a madhouse that night,\u201d says Miller.) Willie Nelson pops in from time to time. And if you\u2019re not fazed by celebrity sightings, the huge country-themed bar has something for everyone. Handsome Stetsoned bar staff sling tequila and beer to a mixed crowd of all ages, ethnicities and orientations to a soundtrack of country and dance music. Patrons pop in to watch Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race, stay for karaoke, country dancing, a drag show. Big businesses come by the busload to sell Dallas as an inclusive place for their workers. \u201cThere was a battle to be fought \u2013 and we won,\u201d says Miller. At Round-Up, maybe, but for queer people, Texas is still not easy. \u201cSmall-town Texas \u2026 there are two religions: football and Jesus. And if you don\u2019t agree with either of those, you are going to hell,\u201d says the drag queen Sable Scities as she beats her face before the night\u2019s performance. Scities grew up in rural Texas and says for many outside of the big cities little has changed. \u201cI snuck up here when I was 17 and snuck into the clubs because this is where you feel accepted. You\u2019re not going to find that at home a lot of times. Maybe Christmas and your birthday.\u201d Texas is still a difficult state for LGBTQ people. Trans women of colour are being murdered, even in Dallas. Gay couples are still being kicked out of bars for dancing together. Coming out here \u201cis never going to be an easy road\u201d, says Pierce, Round-Up\u2019s co-owner and Miller\u2019s partner. \u201cThere\u2019s progress, but there\u2019s always that hatred.\u201d The bar\u2019s owners organize charity events and back initiatives aimed at tackling the alarming rates of suicide and addiction in the community. Outside the Round-Up and its surrounding gayborhood, Texas conservatives are still fighting the \u201cgood\u201d fight, trying to pass a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ. Little wonder, then, that gay people travel from across the state to spin their spurs at the saloon. After 33 years at the bar, Pierce and Miller are thinking of hanging up their hats. They have their eye on a place in Mexico. Miller\u2019s son, who is straight, will take over. \u201cBut it will always be a gay bar,\u201d he says. \u201cHe knows not to mess with a good thing.\u201d The resistance: The Back Door in Bloomington, Indiana Smoove Gardner and Nicci Boroski won\u2019t forget the night of 8 November 2016 in a hurry. The owners of The Back Door, Bloomington, Indiana\u2019s radical queer bar, had organized a huge party for what they thought was going to be the election of the first female president of the United States. There were beanbags on the floor and hundreds of people sat around, sometimes going outside to smoke and relieve tension. \u201cAnd then, as things started to go south, people started to get very drunk and very sad,\u201d says Boroski, who identifies as gender queer and uses the they pronoun. \u201cIt was just piles of people cuddling and weeping together by the end of the night.\u201d Trump\u2019s election was an especially bitter blow because it ushered in Mike Pence, Indiana\u2019s former governor, as the vice-president. Pence, who once said it was \u201cGod\u2019s idea\u201d to stop same-sex couples marrying, has a long history of working against pro-LGBTQ reforms. (Trump once joked Pence would like to \u201chang\u201d gay people.) And so the fight was on. The election helped radicalize the queer community. \u201cIt matters now. You being active and paying attention. It matters,\u201d says Gardner. Established in 2016 as a politically minded queer venue, The Back Door is tucked down an alleyway behind a car park. A Golden Girls mural adorns its exterior. Inside, the venue is a cosy, crazy den-like space, with wallscovered in zebra stripes and campy unicorn paintings. The gender neutral bathrooms the walls read: \u201cNO MERCY FOR THE PATRIARCHY, BE A SLUT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BURN THE ICE VANS PLEASE \u2026\u201d The Back Door could come across as a little serious if it weren\u2019t for the owners\u2019 determination to have fun. \u201cI feel like this space is part community center, part entertainment center \u2013 because there is so much crap happening right now that sometimes you just need to come dance and forget about it,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cLiving joyously is a radical act in a broken world, especially in an unjust world. For people to come here and be their most fabulous selves and let go is an act of resistance,\u201d says Boroski. On the night we visit, the bar is having a benefit for sex workers. A zaftig tattooed dancer billed as \u201cVirgin Mary\u201d poledances to Hozier\u2019s Work Song in a jacket that reads: \u201cMake Nazis Scared Again\u201d as a queer crowd collects cash for National Abortion Fund and Red Light Legal. It\u2019s all very woke David Lynch. The Back Door is not a space for everyone, and that\u2019s the point. One patron complained online that they didn\u2019t feel safe in the bar and worried there might be a riot \u2013 \u201cor a massacre\u201d, laughs Boroski. \u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody here,\u201d they say. \u201cThere are plenty of venues for heterosexuals.\u201d And if someone doesn\u2019t like the vibe? \u201cI\u2019m like, fantastic! See you never! Tell Google!\u201d As for the future of LGBTQ rights, huge issues remain, Boroski says. Gay people \u2013 and especially white gay men \u2013 have made great strides since Stonewall, but even in the gay community, transphobia and racism are still issues. It\u2019s a bitter irony that 50 years after Stonewall, while Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera \u2013 two trans women of colour and two of the main actors in the Stonewall riots \u2013 are being celebrated, trans people are still being \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d, and trans people of colour are \u201cbeing killed left and right \u2013 and nobody gives a shit\u201d, says Boroski. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a fucking problem.\u201d If Indiana cracked down on the queers, The Back Door is exactly the sort of place where a riot could start, says Gardner. \u201cIn remembrance of Stonewall, keep a brick in your pocket,\u201d says Boroski. \u201cDon\u2019t get complacent. But also live joyously, because that is a radical act.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
