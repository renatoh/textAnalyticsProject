They might usefully begin by considering whether there is any moral distinction to be drawn between Sir Mark Thatcher and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. As far as one can see, both men had precisely similar aims - i.e., to rid the world of an evil dictator who was causing his subjects a great deal of misery. In the case of Saddam Hussein, Blair insists that he did the right thing when he and his friend, George Bush, overthrew the tyrant. Sir Mark, who was arrested, has yet to give the world the justification for his alleged role in the attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea. But perhaps he, too, would maintain that the world would be a better place without President Teodoro Obiang, a man who, like Saddam, has a contempt for civil rights and a liking for torture and execution. It is said that Thatcher and his fellow plotters were really interested in securing the lucrative oil fields of this African state. But exactly the same is said against Blair. Wasn't the initial aim of the Pentagon to install their puppet, convicted fraudster Ahmed Chalabi, as leader of the newly democratic Iraq and thereby acquire all kinds of lucrative contracts for their business friends and backers? Sir Mark's operation was against the law, which is why he now finds himself under arrest. But, again, many lawyers argue that Blair's war was also illegal. In the circumstances, it seems rather unfair that Thatcher could be facing imprisonment while Blair is not only still at large but still running the country. Private failings The privatised railway companies have perfected the arts of persuading the public that they are doing everything to help them when actually all they are concerned about is their profit, or lack of it. The shutting down this weekend of the main line between Reading and Paddington to coincide with the August bank holiday has become an annual event, just like the Reading rock festival, which also coincides. And every year, the official explanation is the same: that far fewer people will be inconvenienced than if they were to close the line during a working week. How considerate they are, putting the welfare of commuters before those of a few thousand rock-loving teenagers. The reason for shutting down the line altogether - something that was never done in the days of British Rail - is that it is cheaper to do the work all at one go. The reason for doing it over the bank holiday weekend is that the loss to the railways is considerably less, but no one will say any of that. Nor will anyone explain why it is that, despite the annual closure, there has been no discernible improvement in the service. It now takes longer to get from Reading to Paddington than it used to and there are still just as many failures, as happened only last week when, once again, the system ground to a halt thanks to yet another breakdown of the signalling system. Hell's bells On a visit to America some years ago, my friend Alexander Chancellor took me to dinner with the famous Washington hostess, Susan Mary Alsop, who died last week. I remember it as a bit of a nightmare occasion. Everything was going smoothly enough in the elegant, candlelit Georgetown dining room until our hostess rang a little silver bell, silencing the company and calling upon one of her distinguished guests, a senator, to give his opinion on the current political situation. For the rest of the meal, I sat in terror that at any minute the little silver bell would ring again and I would be invited to pontificate on a matter of topical importance. Luckily, it didn't happen but the apprehension that it might was quite enough to spoil my enjoyment of the evening. The ringing of the bell or its equivalent, the tapping of the spoon on the wine glass, often at the precise moment when people have just begun to have a good time, is guaranteed to spell the end of all fun. It was another famous American, Robert Benchley, who said that the most disagreeable combination of words in the English language was: 'The doctor will see you now.' Agreed. But a close second, as far as I'm concerned, must be: 'Would you care to say a few words?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
