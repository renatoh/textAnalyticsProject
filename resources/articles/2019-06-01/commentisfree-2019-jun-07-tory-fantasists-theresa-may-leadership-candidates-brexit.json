Or perhaps a lightly oaked strychnine. Still, what news from the revels? I\u2019m afraid Kit Malthouse is already out. And that other guy. James Cleverly, maybe? They simply burned too brightly. Dominic Raab seems to have been disturbed during some policymaking again, leaving dogwalkers to find the remains of an idea to prorogue parliament so that no deal happens by default. On one level, this is the only policy position Dominic can adopt, having already resigned in protest at a deal he himself negotiated as Brexit secretary. However, Raab remains at large in this contest, with people warned not simply to avoid approaching him \u2013 that is a given \u2013 but to stay away from anyone even backing him. I mean, is he really going to drag the Queen into it? By \u201cit\u201d, I obviously mean a constitutional crisis, not his van. Elsewhere, Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s robot sidekick Steve Baker is still hearing the clamour for him to run, and will if no one else signs up to the ERG\u2019s no-deal plan. \u201cI did go through some training on this,\u201d he announced. \u201cIn moments of death or glory, you tell people what you\u2019re doing, you don\u2019t participate.\u201d Two things. One. Is \u201cdeath or glory\u201d an intentional reference to the 17th Lancers \u2013 \u201cthe death or glory boys\u201d \u2013 and their notable role in the Charge of the Light Brigade? If not, perhaps a less auto-satirical military reference might be found. Two. What \u201ctraining\u201d? Is this about the time you got an ex-services guy to take you round the back of the warehouse and floor you, apparently for a self-defence video? But this week, let\u2019s focus on the chaps \u2013 and they are all chaps, as rival candidate Sam Gyimah noted \u2013 who reckon they can go back to the EU and get a better deal by sheer force of their personality or something. Even though they\u2019ve been told, many times, that they can\u2019t. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock \u2026 you know the pack drill. As far as this prong of their Brexit strategy goes, they resemble one of those guys whose girlfriend has broken up with them for her own reasons, but who just knows she\u2019s going to change her mind if they make a sufficiently big and bold gesture. You know, like send her flowers. Write her a letter. Write more letters. Start sending the flowers to her work. Play the violin in the street below her flat. Turn up at her work. Call her repeatedly at 1am to demand she doesn\u2019t do this to you both. Send her dogshit at work. What can I tell you? They\u2019re incurable romantics. Staying in the world of metaphor, I see Michael Gove is back on the analogies again. In the immediate wake of the EU referendum vote, when Michael felt forced to knife Boris Johnson and embark on his own leadership run, he justified it thus: \u201cI compare it to a group of people standing outside a collapsing building, wondering who is going to rescue a child inside. I thought: well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got either the strength or the speed for this, but as I looked around, I thought, God, I\u2019m at least as strong and at least as fast as the others. I\u2019ve got to try to save the child.\u201d I will never get over this characterisation. IT WAS YOU WHO STARTED THE FIRE, YOU MAD BASTARD! Indeed, there is a distinct flavour of the end-to-end service Michael Gove offers in his latest analogy. \u201cWho is the pilot who has landed the plane successfully at times of turbulence,\u201d he wondered rhetorically this week, \u201cand made sure the passengers are safe and the destination has been reached? I\u2019ve been through a lot of political turbulence and I\u2019ve always been able to land the plane.\u201d Is this the version of the Tom Hanks movie where Captain Sully Sullenberger spends the first act nobbling the engines? Michael\u2019s what I think of as a Gwyneth Paltrow Conservative, in honour of the way the Goop founder\u2019s fringe lunacies create ailments specifically so she can cure you of them. Or to put in terms the 1922 committee would feel most comfortable with: she\u2019ll sell you a $66 jade egg to pop up your fanny, causing you intense lower back pain, which you will then be advised to cure with a $180 subcutaneous tissue roller, causing livid bruising best treated by some $300 arnica oil. And so on. It becomes very expensive very quickly. (And yes, I AM hoping that this article ends up being headlined \u201cBREXIT WAS A JADE FANNY EGG\u201d.) And so, finally, to the man Michael\u2019s going to try and reknife at some point in the coming weeks. Boris Johnson has informed MPs they need to \u201cstop banging on about Brexit and put that bawling baby to bed\u201d. Yup, there\u2019s no show without Punch. News that Johnson has pocketed \u00a3700,000 for speeches since leaving office is embarrassing for anyone who paid him, though sadly not surprising. Johnson\u2019s oratorical style is best categorised as speeches for people who don\u2019t like speeches. Indeed, as far as I am aware, he only has one speech \u2013 the one where we\u2019re going to sell French knickers to the French, sparkling wine to the Italians, naans to the Indians and so on. I\u2019ve seen it live about 10 times, and in print at least 30. Here he goes again. Off the bar stool for the second chorus. Like everything about Johnson it is an ersatz version of something else. He is the X Factor contestant covering Winston Churchill. Yet just as Simon Cowell would always rather listen to some autotuned teen\u2019s version of Feeling Good than the Nina Simone original, so large numbers of people seem to prefer Johnson\u2019s inauthentic nonsense to anything of actual quality. He remains the runaway favourite for this contest \u2013 the greatest shitshow on earth \u2013 and we must all adjust our bunker arrangements accordingly. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
