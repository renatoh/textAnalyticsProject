Eleven people died in the fighting that ensued and for a while it was assumed by some that a corner had been turned, as several groups abandoned their bases. Ansar al-Shariah and the Abu Salim brigade disbanded and left their bases in Derna, east of Benghazi. Libya's prime minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur said that eight Libyans had been arrested in connection with the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens. The president of the new parliament and de facto head of state, Muhammad Magariaf, issued a deadline by which all unauthorised militia would be shut down: midnight on Monday. It did not take long before reality dawned. On Monday other Islamist militias, notably the Rafallah al-Sahati, claiming to operate under Tripoli's authority, began a round up of the Benghazi protesters whom they accused of instigating violence. Among those detained were 30 military officers. Many of these militias played a key role in the uprising which destroyed Muammar Gaddafi's regime. The glue that held them together, the common cause of liberating Libya from a family-run tyranny, is now gone and it is left to thousands of volunteer mediators \u2013 also armed \u2013 to keep the peace between them. The death of Stevens has revealed the fault lines of this process. For while Libya has successfully navigated elections in July and the selection of a compromise candidate as prime minster, it is still far from approaching a functioning state. Security is a local franchise held by firmly established militias. The national army and police force are weak in comparison \u2013 as we are witnessing in Benghazi. Which leaves the government in Tripoli struggling to control the state both politically and geographically. Eastern Libya, which accounts for 80% of the oil production, is not just home to long-established Islamist groups, among them militant Salafis and Takfiris, which sent fighters off to Iraq and Afghanistan. It has long been an advocate of federalism and local autonomy. The selection of Magariaf as head of parliament, a man who hails from Ajdabiya in the east, was intended as a signal of provincial inclusion. All these pressures could bubble to the surface again if civil unrest continues in Benghazi. The US is still trying to recover from the blow of the sacking of its consulate, which had many more US nationals than it claimed on its books, or was necessary for its operation. A whole CIA operation was based in the lightly guarded embassy annex which came under attack. It is another reminder that giving military backing to an uprising provides no insurance policy for what follows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
