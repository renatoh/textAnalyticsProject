Norwich took the lead early on through a lovely exchange between Wes Hoolahan and Chris Martin, setting up Russell Martin who \u2013 catching the end of a blocked shot \u2013 struck home. From thereon in QPR struggled to mount a convincing comeback, an effort that became more difficult still after their defender Matt Connolly was sent off for a professional foul early in the second half. \"It's a miracle, honestly,\" said Lambert after beating Neil Warnock's top of the table side, now only four points clear. \"It makes it even more remarkable the amount of players we've got out,\" he said, citing the fact that Norwich were missing six players through injury and suspension and were forced to rely on a rarely tested pairing of centre-backs. \"We played strongly. We were brilliant, I can't ask for any more.Their desire was fantastic.\" Norwich move up to third with their fifth win from six games, confirming their status as promotion candidates. But even after such a convincing display Lambert continued to insist that avoiding relegation remains the aim. \"Still is,\" said the Scotsman who took over 18 months ago, leading Norwich to promotion from League One in a single season. Surely now, being third in their first season back in the Championship, he must reconsider? \"No. No,\" he said, shaking his head, \"Just survive. I'm just hanging in.\" What if the club get above 50 points? \"Ask me on the last day of May and if we're still up there we might have a chance.\" Norwich played attractive attacking football, Hoolahan \u2013 mainly a bit part player until his hat-trick against Sheffield United last week \u2013 and Chris Martin ran riot through QPR's midfield, while Richard Martin was a marauding presence at right-back. There were chances galore \u2013 debutant Aaron Wilbraham thought he had doubled the deficit early on but the linesman blew for offside, while Grant Holt could have had several goals in the first half alone. In truth Norwich should have scored many more, testimony to the QPR keeper Paddy Kenny's vital saves that kept the visitors in with a chance of equalising right up until the whistle. QPR, meanwhile, looked distinctly average. Going forward, Adel Taarabt failed to dazzle, struggling even to get free-kicks on target, while Heider Helguson hardly touched the ball. As Taarabt grew agitated, earning a yellow card early in the second half, Warnock brought on Patrick Agyemang to add firepower up front. The substitute striker almost equalised with 15 minutes to play, in what was QPR's best chance of the game, after Leon Clarke set him up \u2013 unchallenged \u2013 in front of goal, but his headed effort flew inches wide. Connolly's sending-off occurred as Holt raced away, the last defender tripping the Norwich captain on the edge of the area. Chris Martin kept Kenny on his toes, and the 22-year-old midfielder could have scored a sackful of chances in the second half but for the keeper's saves. That QPR failed to score against Norwich, a side who had not recorded a clean sheet in 10 games, spoke volumes. Still, Warnock would not scold his players, instead criticising the referee for failing to spot a handball from Holt \u2013 \"it's the little sneaky ones that the referees should be looking at,\" he said. Overall he was pleased, though. \"I can't fault it, I thought the effort was super. I thought we were in the ascendancy in the second half. With 11 men we might have had a few more chances. \"But six points out of three games \u2013 I'm quite happy about that over Christmas.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
