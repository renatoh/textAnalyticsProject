He's being pinned down': voters on Trump impeachment drama", "bodyText": "The impeachment hearing was playing out on a big screen right above Robin Dock\u2019s head, but she was intentionally oblivious to the historic drama unfolding in far-off Washington. \u201cI really don\u2019t get worked up about it. It\u2019s not super interesting, and I don\u2019t devote my energies to it,\u201d said Dock, among the lunchtime crowd in the Flying Saucer bar in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cMy husband follows it. He\u2019ll give me some highlights.\u201d A few televisions in the bar were tuned into C-Span alongside the usual sports coverage, but they drew barely a glance from patrons. That didn\u2019t mean there was no interest in what the hearings might reveal. But some said they had jobs to go to. Others, like Dock, thought life too short to watch Congress at work. Dock, a manager in an accountancy firm, describes herself as a supporter of the president because he holds the office \u2013 but not of Trump the man. She\u2019s uncertain about the impeachment process. \u201cAs soon as you hear one thing and I think, I believe that, then there\u2019s this competing news story that comes out. I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on there. How can I know? I don\u2019t trust, and don\u2019t feel like I can verify,\u201d she said. Steve Martin, on the other hand, said he has been following events closely. \u201cIt is fascinating. Of course we\u2019ve known for years that he is a thuggish criminal but now he\u2019s being comically pinned down,\u201d he said. Martin, a computer programmer, said he \u201cthumbed through the transcripts\u201d from the closed-door questioning of witnesses. He described them as damning but doubts the televised public hearings will shift many people\u2019s position. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a game-changer because 90% of the people who could be convinced already have been. Most of the people who support him don\u2019t care about what came out behind closed doors, or what caused the hearings to be held in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents probably think that he doesn\u2019t deserve to be impeached at all, so why would they pay attention to this?\u201d Martin thinks Trump will be impeached by the House of Representatives but doubts enough Republicans will turn on the president in the Republican-controlled Senate to convict him. A couple of insurance underwriters, Chris Tate and Brad Finkbiner, said that with claims and counter-claims coming from all directions they had no idea what to believe. Tate said he would \u201cget the highlights later\u201d to try to understand it. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot needs to come out in the wash before you can make a well-versed judgment over any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much separation between one side and the other it\u2019s hard to understand what the truth is.\u201d Dock was lunching with a colleague, Mary Ocker, who is no fan of the president but doesn\u2019t think the hearings will change the course of American politics. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get impeached. It\u2019s not long to the election. Let\u2019s let it play out,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
