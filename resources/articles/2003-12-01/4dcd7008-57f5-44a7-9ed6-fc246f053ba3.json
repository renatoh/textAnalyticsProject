Just hours later, another suicide bomber blew himself up at a US military base near Baghdad, lightly injuring two soldiers, while three Iraqis were killed in a rocket attack on their Sunni mosque in the city. The first suicide attack happened after a car drove at the gate of the barracks in Talafar, which is 30 miles west of Mosul, US military spokesman Major Trey Cate said. Guards opened fire on the vehicle after the driver ignored orders to halt as it approached the base of the 101 Airborne Division's 3rd Brigade early this morning. Moments later, the car blew up, leaving a large crater at the barracks gate. \"It was definitely a suicide bomb - there were pieces of the individual all over the compound,\" brigade commander Colonel Michael Linnington said. Most of the soldiers' injuries were caused by debris and flying glass and were not serious. However, four people suffered more serious wounds and were evacuated to a military hospital, a US army spokesman added. An Iraqi translator was also wounded. The early morning blast happened when most soldiers were still inside the barracks, and there was no traffic around the gate. The explosion damaged homes and a school near the base, but caused no serious structural damage to the barracks itself. No schoolchildren were injured, because the bombing occurred before classes had begun. Just after dawn, an explosion at the Ahbab al-Mustafa mosque in Baghdad's western Hurriya district killed three people and injured two, Iraqi police said. Ahmed Hussein, the mosque's prayer leader, said the explosion occurred at 6.45am local time, and had damaged the building and several cars parked nearby. \"Those who carried out the attack have nothing to do with any religion,\" said the mosque's imam, Farouk Khamis. \"They are ordinary criminals who targeted believers doing their prayers.\" Earlier today, three soldiers died in a road accident in central Iraq, the US military said. A further soldier was injured after an embankment north of Baghdad collapsed beneath their armoured personnel carriers. A US army spokesman said that the accident had not been a result of hostile action. The soldiers were part of the 2nd Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade. In another incident, a US army observation helicopter made an emergency landing west of Baghdad, but there were no reported casualties. Residents said the helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. The deaths bring to 448 the number of US soldiers who have died in Iraq since the US-led invasion began on March 20. Of those, 308 have died as a result of hostile action. The British military has reported 52 deaths, Italy 17 and Spain eight. Denmark, Ukraine and Poland have reported one fatality each."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
