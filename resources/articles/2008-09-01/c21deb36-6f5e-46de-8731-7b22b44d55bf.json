For all the valiant efforts of Edward Kemp in revising the uncompleted text, it emerges as an Oriental political pantomime that starts as a self-hating satire on intellectuals and ends as a replay of Arturo Ui. The result owes more to confusion than Confucius. At least in the first half Brecht's intention is clear. When the emperor of China, who holds a monopoly on cotton, convenes a congress to excuse the commodity's apparent shortage, the intellectuals line up to whitewash the regime; there is even a prize for the best piece of official mendacity, in the shape of the emperor's daughter. But, while all this is obvious fun at the expense of toadying eggheads who will do anything to appease tyranny - and recalls Brecht's own subservience to the Ulbricht regime during the 1953 workers' uprising - the play splinters and fragments in the later stages. It switches its target to the brutal power-politics of a gun-toting gangster, finally superceded by a Maoist leader whose followers all brandish a little red book. At his best, Brecht was a master ironist adept at exploring the cost of survival in an unjust world. But here the satire is surprisingly coarse, as in Turandot's giggling arousal at the prospect of any unorthodox opinion. Even allowing for our own subsequent knowledge, it is also difficult to share Brecht's optimism about the workers' paradise supposedly ushered in by the Chinese revolution. I admire the wholehearted commitment of Anthony Clark's production and a hardworking cast, led by Gerard Murphy as a whimsically autocratic emperor. But the piece strikes me as a dated curio at a time when the real trahison des clercs is less subservience to tyranny than surrender to an increasingly threadbare popular culture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
