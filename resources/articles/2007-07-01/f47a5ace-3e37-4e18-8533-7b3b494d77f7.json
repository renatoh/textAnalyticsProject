If they were unavailable, well, she could just tweet into a microphone and sample her own birdsong to accompany 'The Park', one of the standout moments on her recent third album, The Reminder 'You cool Londoners are all about to sing together,' Feist smiles mysteriously, before dividing the pliant crowd into a three-note harmony. This collective 'ah' ushers her band into 'So Sorry', another pristine cut from The Reminder. Her own voice is located somewhere between Astrud Gilberto's lilt and Cat Power's exhalation; the planes of her face, meanwhile, suggest Patti Smith. She grapples a semi-acoustic like PJ Harvey, but that's where the musical similarities end. If they know her at all, most people will know the raven-haired Canadian singer-songwriter from 'Mushaboom', one of those quirky songs whose use in an advert (for Lacoste aftershave) gives obscure artists a leg up - see also Vashti Bunyan, Devendra Banhart. Inevitably, she has been toiling for years in the Canadian underground on her own, and as part of the Broken Social Scene; she is a mainstay, too, of the Berlin outpost that numbers electro sexpot Peaches and rapper-turned-producer Chilly Gonzales. The Reminder is even better than her second album - 2004's Let It Die, from which 'Mushaboom' was lifted - which established Feist as a secret too good to keep. She is utterly delightful tonight, rescuing the art of the female singer-songwriter from the ghastly coven of Meluas who have hijacked it. A four-piece band (on guitars, drums, keyboards, trumpets, xylophones and melodica) injects more rock into her tunes than they often have on record. But she can do delicate and shivery turns at the piano, or produce a thrilling call-and-response romp, 'Sealion', which owes much to Nina Simone. Moreover, beyond the feather-light songs ('1234') that are her commercial calling cards, sombre turns such as 'Let It Die' confirm that Feist is a seasoned observer of heartbreak. If only Mark Lanegan had been duetting with Feist this week. She could sing circles around him. As it is, he is paired with Isobel Campbell in an evening of duets that promises a re-run of an evergreen story - The Beauty and the Beast - only fed through the pickups of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. They take the stage in a Queen Elizabeth Hall so reverential, you could hear a mouse fart. On the left, dressed all in country black, with cascading blonde tresses, is Campbell, Glaswegian indie princess. She was the sweet-voiced multi-instrumentalist, the 'belle' in Belle &amp; Sebastian, then went solo. Her knee-high leather boots were made for walking (and for invoking that Nancy Sinatra song). On the right, dressed also all in black like a baddy in an old film, is Mark Lanegan, a tar-voiced presence on recent Queens of the Stone Age albums. He started out in that most molten of grunge-era bands, the Screaming Trees, and has since forged a solo career that could be described as respectable, if it weren't for the residual drug damage and quiet menace of the man himself. It is hard to imagine a musical couple odder than Lanegan and Campbell (unless you're counting Nick Cave and Kylie, another textbook beauty 'n' beast hookup). And intriguingly, it is Campbell who is pulling the strings. She produced the album they made together last year, wrote most of the songs; she plays cello and some keyboards and - on tonight's cover of Lee and Nancy's 'Sand' - a dinky Stylophone. It would be magical, if only there were some chemistry between them. Even bad chemistry. Even taking into account the calculated art in their glacial distance, the gulf between them is a problem that mars everything but the encore. Lanegan's vocals dominate effortlessly. Campbell is less a singer than a vocal nuance, cooing phantasmically; her Snow White is no match for Lanegan's saturnine Grumpy. They don't even look at each other. When she adjusts the tail spike on her cello, you secretly hope Campbell might stab Lanegan with it, if only to spice up their relationship. Their duets are pleasant but sterile exercises in what happens when a soft voice meets a gravelly one on some dusty country roads. Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris they are not (much less Richard and Linda Thompson). But at the end, the magic happens. Once the skilful band has forced everyone to loosen up, songs such as 'Ramblin' Man' flow easily; Campbell's whistled solo is both funny and authoritative. Lanegan cracks a smile when heckled, but refuses to open his mouth - hilarious, in its own small way. Indeed, a roustabout 'Come On Over (Turn Me On)' suggests there is a future in this arranged marriage. But in future, they should just start at the encore and ditch the uncomfortable foreplay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
