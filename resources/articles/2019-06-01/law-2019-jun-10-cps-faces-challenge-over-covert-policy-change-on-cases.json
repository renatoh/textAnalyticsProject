Fewer than 4% of women who report attacks can now expect their complaint to reach trial, according to a coalition of women\u2019s organisations who accuse the CPS of \u201csecond-guessing jury prejudices\u201d. While the number of rapes reported to the police nearly tripled between 2014 and 2018, the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) points out that the number of cases charged and sent to court fell by 44%. The problem was revealed last year in the Guardian, which reported that CPS leaders were encouraging prosecutors to drop what they termed \u201cweak\u201d cases. The legal challenge, funded through the CrowdJustice website, argues that the CPS has \u201ccovertly changed its policy and practice in relation to decision-making on rape cases\u201d. A \u201cletter before action\u201d initiating the case has been sent to the CPS. It includes a dossier of 21 cases where decisions have been made not to charge despite allegedly compelling evidence. In some cases suspects were known to be violent. Sarah Green, of EVAW, said: \u201cWe have strong evidence to show that CPS leaders have quietly changed their approach to decision-making in rape cases, switching from building cases based on their merits back to second-guessing jury prejudices. This is extremely serious and is having a detrimental impact on women\u2019s access to justice. \u201cWe are witnessing a collapse in justice after rape at a time when increasing numbers of women are speaking out and reporting these crimes. We\u2019re hearing from women who\u2019ve been raped and they are telling us about cases being dropped for reasons that are hard to understand.\u201d Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which represents EVAW, said: \u201cWe are arguing that the CPS\u2019s systemic failure to prosecute rape is a human rights failure and has a discriminatory impact on women, who are the large majority of rape victims. Failures by the CPS to consult on changes to policy and [disregarding] its own guidance developed to tackle the under-prosecution of rape are, we argue, unlawful.\u201d Katie Russell, the national spokesperson for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said: \u201cDespite significant increases in the number of victims and survivors of rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse reporting to the police in recent years, the vast majority of those who\u2019ve been subjected to these traumatic experiences still choose not to pursue criminal justice.\u201d Claire Waxman, the independent victims\u2019 commissioner for London, said: \u201cIf the CPS have changed their policy without consultation and it is impacting victims\u2019 access to justice, then this must be remedied immediately.\u201d A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cSexual offences are some of the most complex cases we prosecute and we train our prosecutors to understand victim vulnerabilities and the impact of rape, as well as consent, myths and stereotypes. Decisions to prosecute are based on whether our legal tests are met \u2013 no other reason \u2013 and we always seek to prosecute where there is sufficient evidence to do so. \u201cVictims have the right to ask for a review of their case by another prosecutor, independent of the original decision-maker, and this is another way we can make sure we are fair and transparent in what we do.\u201d A report published by the civil liberties organisation Justice on Monday says extra resources are needed to investigate and prosecute sexual offences because of the increase in digital evidence and the rapid escalation in the number of offences being reported. The report, containing 57 recommendations, also calls for complainants not to be called \u201cvictims\u201d during prosecutions \u201cto ensure that the policy of believing the complainant until there is \u2018credible evidence to the contrary\u2019 does not prejudice the suspect\u201d. Judges authorised to deal with sexual offences should be given additional training, it says. Ministers, senior police and prosecutors will meet on Monday to discuss how to improve disclosure of digital evidence. It follows a row over the use of consent forms for digital disclosure after warnings that complainants who deny police access to their mobile phone contents could allow rape suspects to escape charges. The solicitor general, Lucy Frazer QC, the policing minister, Nick Hurd, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave, the victims\u2019 commissioner, Dame Vera Baird QC, and representatives from the technology industry will meet in London. Frazer said: \u201cWe need to do more to support police and prosecutors to adapt to the increasing volume of digital material in the criminal justice system. The government is also determined to ensure that victims of sexual violence and all other crimes are not deterred from seeking justice because of fear of what could happen to their personal information.\u201d How victims are being failed Gina said police encouraged her to report a rape committed by an abusive ex-partner when she contacted them about another incident in 2016. The attack had taken place nearly 10 years earlier. \u201cBringing it all up again was traumatic,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey assured me they could convict him. I recorded a video statement, which took four hours. I had to collect evidence from people with whom I was at university. \u201cLater I discovered they had posted me a copy of the statement but sent it to the wrong address. It went to the house I used to share with my ex-partner. Then they said it had been recorded at the wrong speed and the files were corrupted. If it was done again, I was told, the CPS would not accept it as evidence. Eventually it was re-recorded. \u201cPart of the evidence was my doctor\u2019s notes, which showed I had been complaining about an abusive relationship. The police told me they had the notes but I discovered they had only obtained them for the previous five years \u2013 not when the abuse was happening. I told them they had not got the right medical evidence. \u201cEventually they said my case was being dropped. One of the reasons was that they thought my allowing the ex-partner to \u2018come and stay with me\u2019 was wrong \u2013 but he had turned up at 5am banging on my door so the only solution was to let him in to quieten him down. \u201cI went through two years of pursuing the case. I did exercise the victim\u2019s right to review \u2013 challenging the CPS on why they had dropped the case. I took them photocopies of my doctor\u2019s notes.\u201d She said the prosecutors believed that because she had taken so long to report the rape and continued to be in touch with her ex-partner, it would be viewed negatively in court. \u201cAfterwards I was contacted by my abusive ex-partner\u2019s family for the first time in 10 years. So this has left me in a more vulnerable position.\u201d Rebecca was at the beginning of a relationship with a man who initially appeared charming but gradually exhibited more controlling behaviour. He had pretended to be a police officer. One weekend he flipped, becoming jealous over photos on her phone. \u201cHe punched me in the back of the head, then he raped me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe CPS wanted to know why I didn\u2019t fight back but I froze, I was stunned. It was trauma. He did not leave my side all weekend. \u201cThe second time he attacked me he had a huge kitchen knife, so the violence was escalating. I got out of the flat and called a friend. I said: \u2018He\u2019s beating me up.\u2019\u201d The friend rang the police. \u201cIf I was logical I would not have gone back in there but I was more worried about him being in my flat. My passport and money were there,\u201d Rebecca said. When officers arrived she was unable to speak freely. Rebecca eventually reported him to the police. She was in the police station all day and night giving them details about the attacks. It turned out he was a prisoner released on licence and was well known to them and had a history of violence against women. He was charged with three counts of rape as well as with offences of destroying property, assault by beating and false imprisonment. \u201cI got a call shortly before Christmas from the investigating detective. She came round and told me that the CPS were dropping the charges. They said that if the jury saw the amicable WhatsApp messages between us [they would not convict]. But those messages were placating him so that I could try and stay alive.\u201d Her case w droppased in the immediate aftermath of publicity surrounding the prosecution of Liam Allen, who acquitted of rape when messages from the complainant asking him for casual sex were revealed. \u201cI twice went through the victim\u2019s right to review [to challenge the CPS\u2019s decision to drop the prosecution]. They said they didn\u2019t think the jury would believe me. But he had sent me text messages saying \u2018I can\u2019t believe what I have done\u2019. It should be for the jury to decide whether they believe my story. The police believed in my case. The end result is that he\u2019s walking around free.\u201d Names have been changed to protect identities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
