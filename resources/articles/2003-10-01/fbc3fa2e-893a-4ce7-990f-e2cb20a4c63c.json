Nilsen's lawyer, Alison Foster, accused the home secretary, David Blunkett, and the governor of Full Sutton prison of breaching his human rights after a copy of his partially-completed book was taken from him by prison authorities. Nilsen, a 57-year-old former policeman, was jailed for life in 1983 on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He admitted killing and butchering 15 young men, most of them homeless homosexuals, at his north London home. He admitted chopping up their bodies, burning them and burying them under floorboards or boiling them and trying to flush them down drains. Today Ms Foster told Mr Justice Maurice Kay, sitting in London, that last October the prison authorities had refused to hand the manuscript back because its contents were \"not within the scope of materials a prisoner may lawfully publish\". Several copies were in the hands of friends, and one was believed to be in the possession of a Sunday newspaper. Ms Foster argued that Nilsen's rights to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights were being breached. She told the judge: \"The prison authorities accept they have interfered with Mr Nilsen's Article 10 rights to expression but claim they are entitled to. They say they are entitled to stop him publishing his manuscript ... We say they are wrong. The law doesn't entitle them to withhold it.\" Ms Foster said Nilsen, when arrested, had made detailed admissions of the killings - \"crimes of the utmost gravity\" - and did not contest that lengthy incarceration was necessary, or that he was obliged to pay for his actions. He later described the killings to author Brian Masters, who wrote a full and detailed biography entitled Killing for Company, which quoted verbatim from Nilsen's own work. When Nilsen began writing his biography in the 1990s, the prison authorities were aware, and material passed in and out of prison. Now several copies of the incomplete manuscript are in existence, with five of them outside prison, some in the hands of Nilsen's friends and may be one in the possession of a Sunday newspaper, said Ms Foster. In May 2002, a court decided that the Prison Service was allowed to read the manuscript and it was provided by Nilsen's then-solicitors with instructions for it to be passed on to him. At the time he was being held at Whitemoor Prison, Cambridgeshire. But the authorities refused to hand over the incomplete work. Asked by the judge if the manuscript had \"unofficially\" been taken out of prison in 1996, Ms Foster said that was disputed and there was sworn evidence that the authorities knew that it was going out. She added there was another occasion when the manuscript was sent out and sent back to Nilsen without interference. If the home secretary's legal argument was now upheld it would mean that \"no serving prisoner may ever publish his autobiography\". The prison rules were being interpreted by the authorities to mean that an inmate could not write about his offences, except in limited circumstances. Exceptions included when a prisoner was seeking to argue that there had been a miscarriage of justice and was seeking access to a court, and when making serious or \"academic\" representations about penal policy, sentencing policy and criminal justice in general. Ms Foster said the restrictions created an anomalous position for prisoners where \"on Wednesday when inside you cannot publish and hurt people's feelings: on Thursday, when you are released, you can.\" She argued that Article 10 rights protecting freedom of expression could be interfered with by the authorities only if there was \"considerable justification\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
