Thousands went to the streets in ecstasy, waving flags, chanting and honking their car horns in long motorcades. Reaching the quarter-finals is, undeniably, reason enough to celebrate, but were they over-reacting? \"We have always lived from memories, hearing time and again about that historic victory against Brazil in Rio in 1950,\" says 28-year-old Eduardo Mesa, while walking covered with the Uruguayan flag along 18 de Julio, the capital's main street. \"Now, I am proud of my squad for the first time in my life.\" For those like Mesa, indeed for all Uruguayans under 40, World Cup glory is a story too many times heard but never experienced at first hand. The two World Cup triumphs, first at home against Argentina in the inaugural tournament in 1930, and then in the heroic deed known as Maracanazo when, against all odds, the national team beat Brazil on their own turf in 1950, are feted. In 1970, Uruguay reached the semi-finals in Mexico but the good times ended pretty much then, at least on the world stage, with the national team winning only one match at the World Cup finals in the intervening 40 years. The performances of Oscar Tab\u00e1rez's team are giving Uruguayans the chance to leave behind past frustrations. \"We are used to suffering and losing,\" says Daniela Ferreira, a 38-year-old fan. \"This time our players gave us a nice surprise. I think we can go further but even if we don't, most Uruguayans will be satisfied to see our country among the best eight teams, something that fans my age have never seen before.\" Uruguay's ticket to the quarter-finals of World Cup 2010, where they play Ghana on Friday, will have a positive economic impact. The millions of dollars Fifa transfers to the Uruguayan Footballer Association after each win will help fund domestic teams and reinforce a trend that has seen a nation of 3.4m people supply players to clubs in Europe, Asia and Latin America. \"Uruguay's performance will open doors for local players yet to try their luck abroad,\" says Enrique Saravia, the president of the Union of Uruguayan Professional Football Players. Missing the 2006 World Cup meant overseas teams were looking elsewhere, and fewer transfers translated into fewer economic resources for Uruguayan clubs. \"The great performance in South Africa will be worth many million US dollars,\" he adds. Some of the money may go to support academies which start teaching those as young as four. The exploits of their strikers, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Diego Forl\u00e1n, will also increase the drive that so many in this middle-income country have \u2013 to become professional footballers and succeed in Europe. The humility displayed by the players and the chemistry between the 23 members of the squad has made it one of the teams most loved by Uruguayans. Twitter and Facebook have also helped to bridge the distance between thousands of fans and their favourite players. More than 150,000 follow Forl\u00e1n's tweets as he reports every step of the team's odyssey in South Africa. Vamosssss Uruguayyyyy!!!! (Spanish for Come oooon Uruguayyyy!!!!) twitted the Atletico de Madrid's striker minutes after winning the last match. \"I wish we all continue enjoying this tournament!!! Regards to my fellow Uruguayans,\" he posted. Many of them are packing right now, putting their hopes in their suitcases. \"In football, as in life, you always need a bit of luck and this time luck is on our side. We have the right to dream and why can't we?\" says Jos\u00e9 Alvez, who is one of thousands who would love to be on the charter flight by national airline Pluna that is preparing to leave for South Africa. But at US$3,000 (about \u00a31,980) for one of the packages Alvez, like many other Uruguayans, will have to cheer from afar against Ghana on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
