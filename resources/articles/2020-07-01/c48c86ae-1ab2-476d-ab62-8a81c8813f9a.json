Saka will play in his first north London derby when Arsenal go to Tottenham on Sunday and the scale of the 18-year-old\u2019s achievement in becoming a key player is significant, given he had played seven minutes of top-flight football before this season. His assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal against Leicester on Tuesday was his 12th in all competitions, coming from a range of different positions. The hype is well under way but Arteta believes Saka should drink it all in provided he is ready to overcome setbacks. \u201cFirst of all, enjoy the moment,\u201d Arteta said when asked what he would tell the teenager to shield him from the spotlight. \u201cFootball has some really good moments and some difficult moments. You are doing so well, enjoy it. But then understand this changes in 24, 48 hours. You have to live [on] your toes all the time, ready to react and act. \u201cBukayo is like this. Every training session, he doesn\u2019t give you any sign there\u2019s something different. There are going to be moments when he was a little bit up and down. It\u2019s normal because it happens to every player, whether you are 18 or 38. He needs to understand that, take it naturally and we are here to support him, to try to make him better, and that\u2019s it \u2013 enjoy.\u201d Arteta has fielded Saka, a naturally left-footed player, as a right-sided attacker in Arsenal\u2019s past two games. He did not look especially comfortable at Wolves but still scored an excellent goal. In the draw with Leicester he oozed danger during the first half and it remains to be seen whether he is moved back to the left, given Eddie Nketiah\u2019s suspension may cause an attacking rejig. If Alexandre Lacazette, who missed a crucial chance against Leicester but produced one of his best displays of the season, keeps his place then Arteta will probably retain a setup that had Aubameyang customarily stationed on the left. Aubameyang will be supported by Kieran Tierney, who has been another of Arsenal\u2019s best performers since last month\u2019s restart. The marauding wing-back endured an injury-plagued six months after arriving from Celtic, leading to speculation about a quick move elsewhere, but Arteta scotched that idea. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere \u2013 I really like him,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody loves him at the club and it is not a coincidence: he earns that every single day, the way he treats people, the way he works, the energy he brings. He has adapted really, really well. He is a player that gives you everything in every session and every game and the quality as well that he is adding.\u201d Nketiah is Arsenal\u2019s only new absentee and there appears little prospect of Matteo Guendouzi or Mesut \u00d6zil returning at Spurs. Guendouzi, who has been training alone, seems increasingly likely to have played his last game for the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
