Bassett suffered the injury when she received a painful jab from the elbow of France\u2019s Camille Abily as the pair challenged for a high ball deep in the second half of England\u2019s 1-0 defeat on Tuesday. The referee failed to spot an incident which left the area beneath Bassett\u2019s eye discoloured and severely swollen but Fifa chose not to use retrospective video evidence commonplace in the Premier League to punish Abily with a ban. Perhaps wanting to preserve good relations, England \u2013 billeted in the same Moncton hotel as France \u2013 did not opt to force the issue by lodging a formal complaint. \u201cIt\u2019s out of my control,\u201d said Bassett. \u201cThe FA have to do what they deem best. I just hope no one else in the tournament is on the receiving end of something like this. I just hope if something like this happens again it is not missed.\u201d The elbow was clearly reckless but Bassett, 28, is not sure it was deliberate, although you sense she has a pretty good idea it was. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see me looking at the ball. I think she jumps higher but her elbow makes contact with my cheek.\u201d Happily her vision remains unaffected. \u201cThe eye itself is good,\u201d said Bassett. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t look great. My mum said, \u2018It just looks like you can\u2019t apply your make-up.\u2019 Everyone is getting on board and abusing me.\u201d The altercation itself was less of a laughing matter. \u201cWhen it happened I was just concentrating on the ball, then I felt something hurt my cheek,\u201d said the Notts County defender who is hoping to win her 51st cap in the now vital Group F game against Mexico in Moncton on Saturday. \u201cI thought that\u2019s not the ball, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I went down, I could feel something getting warmer and warmer. I thought what the hell is this. I could feel it getting warmer and warmer. \u201cI thought \u2018Am I OK? Am I not?\u2019 I realised I was OK. That is when I got back up. I didn\u2019t have a clue what had happened. Jill Scott came up to me and I said, \u2018I need a drink\u2019 and she said, \u2018OK but do you want me to put water on it?\u2019 I was like, \u2018What?\u2019 \u201cJill said she got scared because she could see this thing growing and growing. I said \u2018No I don\u2019t want water\u2019. I didn\u2019t have a clue but I knew it was not the ball that had done the damage. When I realised there had been no red or yellow card I had to switch myself back on to stay in the game. I wasn\u2019t that happy with the contact. I could feel something growing under my eye. I went to the referee and said, \u2018What\u2019s this, what\u2019s happened here?\u2019 But if you\u2019re not hurt, you don\u2019t stay down. \u201cFaking injury has never been part of our game. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that good actresses but I think we should stick to playing football. We\u2019re here to do a job and hopefully deliver it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
