Labour's record on pensions was trumpeted at a rally in Glasgow by Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid and senior union leader Bill Morris. Reid claimed benefits such as free television licences and winter fuel allowance would not be safe in Tory hands. But Scottish Tories attacked Labour for 'insulting' pensioners with means testing and pledged to 'free a million pensioners from paying tax'. Scottish Tory president, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, said: 'I think Scottish pensioners will remember the insulting 75p increase that Labour grudgingly gave last year.' The SNP spent the day attacking Labour over fuel taxes and promoting its own pledge to cut fuel tax by 10p a gallon. Launching a new campaign leaflet on the policy, Shadow Transport Minister Bruce Crawford pledged to bring fuel tax in line with the European average. 'It is absurd motorists in oil-rich Scotland are forced to pay the highest fuel prices in Europe.' And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who was in his Scottish constituency on a visit to Skye, promised to introduce 'socially just' policies for the elderly and attacked Labour's record on pensions for 'adding insult to injury'. He said his party would raise the state pension by up to \u00a315 a week for the oldest pensioners. He claimed the measure, which would be funded by a 10p increase in the top band of tax, would benefit the poorest pensioners the most. He said: 'All the evidence shows that the oldest pensioners tend to be the poorest and that's why our commitment is to fund a flat rate increase of \u00a35 for all single pensioners, \u00a38 for a pensioner couple, rising to \u00a310 if you are over 75 and \u00a315 if you are over 80.' Kennedy insisted his policy had been independently shown to be economically viable and claimed the other parties had failed to produce coherent policies.
