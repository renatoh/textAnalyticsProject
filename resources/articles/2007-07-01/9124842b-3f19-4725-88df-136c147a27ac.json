Can potholer Pete - airlifted in to help the club arrange an adventure day - apply balm to their broiling brows? No. Slumped, knackered, in a cave, Pete wonders aloud what it might be like to die underground, where the THUD-THUD-THUD of daggers plunging into dowager's humps is, one imagines, nothing more than a murmur. Empire's Children 9pm, Channel 4 \"I remember eating an awful lot of brain,\" harrumphs Hugh Rigg of his childhood in India, as his sister, Dame Diana, coos over fetching photos of their father's moustache. Of the other elements that one may associate with an upbringing under the Raj - the balmy privilege, the oleaginous pomp, the shrieking oppression - there is, alas, little more than a blank shrug. \"But darling, that's the way it was,\" soothed the late Mrs Rigg when a troubled young Diana asked her about the awfulties of the Empire. It's a phrase that is repeated, mantra-like, throughout the opening episode of a new series that, with its ancestral revelations and sweeping historical vistas, is essentially Who Do You Think You Are? with a larger overnight bag. Here, Dame Diana travels in the footsteps of her railway engineer father, who was, naturally, \"a regular guest at the Maharaja's hunting lodge\". It's all terribly polite but frightfully unforthcoming. Which is - one imagines, darling - just the way it was. Sex, Lies and Hypnosis 10pm, Five \"Hypnosis,\" ululates glamorous therapist Ursula James, \"can be an emotional laxative.\" And so it proves for Luton-based squabblers Woody and Claire, whose relationship can apparently be saved by getting them to sit on a DFS leather swivel-chair and imagine themselves lying \"on a wuuunderfuuul beeeeach\". Soon, repressed memories are dribbling everywhere and geysers of hot tears are threatening the nap of James's 0 designer rug. Exploitative isn't the word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
