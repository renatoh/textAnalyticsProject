The airline said its contingency plans for dealing with the strike, which include using 1,000 volunteer cabin crew and 22 chartered jets, had got off to a \"good start\". But the Unite union, which represents the crew, said the number of planes stacking up at airports across the country because of the strike was growing, with 85 parked at Heathrow, 20 at Cardiff and 20 in Shannon. The union said its 12,000 members were solidly supporting the walkout and that none of the buses that normally transport crew to work had crossed picket lines. A BA spokeswoman said: \"We aim to fly as many customers as we can this weekend. At Heathrow and Gatwick we have got off to a good start. London City is operating as normal. \"Cabin crew are reporting as normal at Gatwick and the numbers reporting at Heathrow are above the levels we need to operate our published schedule. \"This is the biggest contingency plan we have ever launched.\" BA is planning to operate all long-haul flights to and from Gatwick plus around half of short-haul flights, while all flights to and from London City Airport are expected to fly as scheduled. BA said 65% of passengers would still be able to reach their destination during the strike, although 1,100 of the 1,950 scheduled flights would be cancelled. BA is using 1,000 volunteer cabin crew and 22 chartered jets, including three Ryanair planes complete with flight attendants. The company said it was confident of handling around 49,000 passengers today and the same number tomorrow, as against about 75,000 for a normal weekend day in March. It has arranged with more than 60 other airlines to take BA customers on their flights. Another four days of industrial action are set to begin on 27 March and further action is expected from mid-April unless the deadlock is broken. Last-ditch talks between BA and Unite collapsed acrimoniously yesterday, with the airline management warning that unless a new framework were drawn up it would scrap an agreement that gives shop stewards the use of company offices and time off to represent members. Unite's joint leader, Tony Woodley, accused BA of wanting a \"war\" with the union and complained that the BA chief executive, Willie Walsh, had tabled a worse offer than one withdrawn last week. Woodley said today that he had been set \"mission impossible\" because of the new offer, which included a four-year pay deal which the union maintained would at best freeze wages until 2014. The union had offered a 2.6% pay cut this year as part of a three-year deal. Woodley said: \"The disruption that passengers will inevitably experience over the next three days could have been spared had BA grasped that you cannot put an offer on the table one day, take it off the next and then come back with a worse one a few days later.\" A Unite spokesman added: \"The support we are getting shows how strongly people feel about this and is in spite of the bullying by management. \"Willie Walsh's appeal for people to cross our picket lines has obviously not worked.\" One industrial relations expert said if BA ended its current arrangement with Unite, which stipulates how much work airline employees can do for the union and what facilities they can use, it would reduce co-operation to the \"bare minimum\". The failure of the peace talks is a bitter blow to Gordon Brown, who is desperate to banish the spectre of large-scale industrial action 46 days before the likely election date. The prime minister has urged the two sides to resolve the dispute, but today the Conservative leader David Cameron accused him of failing to act because Unite is \"bankrolling\" the Labour Party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
