Most of the other passengers were Korean grandmothers off to trade boxes of some sort of herb in Japan. I rarely expect much from a ferry other than it moves and it floats and the vessel met these expectations but little else. I was asleep before the dim light had finally faded over the stormy and exotically named Sea of Genkai. I'd originally planned to sail to Shimonoseki at the southern tip of Honshu Island and the nearest to South Korea. The port is famed for its blowfish delicacy but I'd had second thoughts about starting my first visit to Japan with some potentially lethal seafood. The fact that chefs have to train for three years before they are allowed to prepare this highly toxic fish is hardly reassuring. As a result my first sight of Japan was watching a spectacular sunrise (appropriately for the Land of the Rising Sun) off the coast of Hiroshima. It was a great way to arrive, floating across the Sea of Suo among hundreds of beautiful rocky islands. Rather than the poisonous blowfish, my first direct contact with Japan was on a formerly radioactive streetcar heading up from the port. At first sight the modern, thriving city of Hiroshima suffers from nothing more than perhaps Japan's highest concentration of Yoko Ono posters. Who knows what to expect coming to a city with such a terrible and tragic history? I found it a very complex experience. It's impossible to fully describe my reaction to a place where, on August 6 1945, 75,000 people were killed and several square kilometres of city centre were flattened and irradiated in three seconds. I'm sure you've heard enough about weapons of mass destruction recently but I think everyone should try and visit this place. Hiroshima was many things. It was shocking when the scale of the death and destruction was made clear; touching when speaking to survivors in the Peace Park or watching the school children clean the shrines; predictable when reading the empty words of the politicians in the museum's visitors book and depressing when reading the disregarded letters from the mayor protesting to the world powers at each nuclear test. It was also surprising, seeing the exact hypocentre of the blast marked by a simple stone on an ordinary back street next to a corner shop. It was certainly ironic as well, that the occupying British and American forces suppressed news of the attack and even banned Hiroshima's Peace Festival in 1950 because they though it would give war a bad name. The train that took me north along the coast would be regarded as an express in most countries and as some kind of space craft in the UK, but in Japan it's seen as laughably slow. Consistent with my first impressions of the country, the train left on time to the exact second and was so spotlessly clean that I didn't want to put my luggage down for fear of getting the floor dirty. The train was also decidedly cheap which contradicted everything I'd ever heard about needing written permission from your bank manager to visit Japan. By the time I reached my ten-pound-a-night-with-free-beer hotel in Kyoto I was beginning to think that all this talk of high prices is just a conspiracy by people who've been there to keep this fascinating country to themselves. I suppose you can't expect luxuries in a cheap hotel but chairs aren't really luxuries are they? The sitting room lay at the centre of a bewildering maze of sliding doors and all the guests, a pile of beer cans and an impressive collection of Clint Eastwood videos were crammed around the low table. The hotel seemed to be the meeting place for Japanese students from every corner of the country from Okinawa to Hokkaido. As I tried to get used to the discomfort of sitting on the tatami mat floor the conversation flowed like the beer with a few words of Japanese and English and a lot of smiling and bowing. My involuntary and ungainly urge to bow back gave me the appearance of a drunken musketeer which made the students smile even more. Unable to sit on the floor any longer I decided to try and get to my feet. Only when I stumbled sideways and crashed into the For a Few Dollars More video did I realise that I'd been sitting on my right leg which had gone completely numb. Unable to move (let alone dig a hole to hide in) I could only lie there in agony whilst the students fell about laughing. Finally with more hopeless bowing I managed to drag my leg out of the room in search of the showers. The hotel didn't have any of these either and directed me to the public bathhouse down the street. The bathhouse, or sento, is an institution in Japan. I had no idea what to expect so it was with a large amount of trepidation and a very small amount of \"modesty towel\" (not much bigger than a tea bag which had been handed to me at the door), that I ventured into the steam. The local sento seemed popular with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia famous for their tattoos and extreme violence. Sitting next to a naked gangster with more body art than the entire Royal Navy was certainly a novel experience but at least the sento had chairs to sit on even if they were only a few inches high. After switching from hot pools to cold pools, from saunas to herbal baths, I was feeling quite dizzy. I thought I'd try one last pool before I left and stepped into the small bath in the corner that even the Yakuza seemed to be avoiding. Suddenly there was a shooting pain in my limbs and I started twitching violently. Even if I could speak Japanese I would have been unable to shout \"Get me a doctor! I'm having a heart attack!\" I had accidentally discovered the electric bath. Combining a hot tub with electricity strikes me as a bad idea but the Japanese say it's good for you (although I notice most won't go near it). The electric bath is agony at first and leaves you feeling a bit battered but I'm actually a big fan of them now. The locals seem very impressed which makes up for that dead leg incident to a certain extent. After a pleasant evening's electrocution I headed back to the hotel totally exhausted and ready for bed. Naturally the hotel didn't have beds as such either. Regardless, I was asleep before my head hit the mat. Kyoto couldn't make up its mind what season it was and neither could I. Sunshine followed snow showers whist the first plum blossom had emerged in the parks and gardens. The city and, in fact, the whole country is currently gripped with the expectation of the approaching cherry blossom season. This is a major and eagerly awaited event in Japan and I've got quite caught up in the whole thing. Flowering trees have not played a major role in my holiday planning before. The students at the hotel from Okayama told me I should visit their city just to see the crocuses. It must be torture for a nation used to trains that run on time to the exact second, not to know in advance the precise moment the cherry blossom will emerge. Kyoto is a treasure house of temples and palaces and served as the home of the Japanese imperial family for more than a 1,000 years. It could be quite possible to spend several days, a considerable amount of money and all your will to live, trying to visit everyone one of the magnificent sights. Even a modest itinerary can be bewildering and very tiring. With so many temples to choose from each one competes aggressively for the faithful. One offers priests in spectacular orange and white robes, one offers a bell so large it takes 17 monks to ring it, one offers a rock which predicts who you'll marry. One temple even offers chairs in the prayer hall. I know which one I'd choose. Despite the competition, even the Sanjusangen-do temple with its 1,000-armed god of mercy and 1,040-armed attendant statues (it was like a millipede convention in there!) was eclipsed by the Kinkaku-ji temple. Even in Kyoto building a temple out of gold is a pretty flash thing to do. Glittering in the early spring sunshine, surrounded by a beautiful lake and garden, it was an awe-inspiring sight. The added attractions of lucky charms for exam success and to prevent car accidents were quite unnecessary. Unable to face any more temples for the time being I headed for Nijo-jo, the palace of the first Tokugama shogun built in 1603, which lies in the centre of the city surrounded by imposing walls and tranquil gardens. Any intruding ninja who could get past the samurai guard house would have to contend with the palace's \"nightingale floors' designed to squeak underfoot as a security device. \"Angry mouse floor\" would be a more accurate if less poetic name but there's no doubting its effectiveness. If you managed to get around the guard house, through the sliding paper screens, across the angry mouse floor and past the beautiful gilt murals to within striking distance of the shogun, then yet more samurai would leap out of secret compartments in the walls and cut you into little pieces. These days all you need is a ticket. I suppose would-be assassins could try and get a job as the shogun's blowfish chef. After long days of sightseeing there was nothing nicer than a good soak in the local sento and a recharge courtesy of the Japanese national grid in the electric bath. Fully refreshed, the evening could then be given over to most tourists' favourite pastime in Kyoto - the geisha safari. Trying to spot the beautiful and elusive geisha in their natural habit in the Gion District of the city can be a very frustrating challenge. There are believed to be only 100 geisha left in Kyoto. At dusk, among the ancient tea houses and narrow streets filled with old ladies in kimonos and other hopeful geisha hunters, you might just spot one. The first sight of a geisha stopped me dead in my tracks and left me wide-eyed in amazement. In return she totally ignored me. She was wearing a beautiful red kimono and carrying a matching lacquer umbrella to keep off the snow that had started to fall again. Her white face looked ghost-like as she fluttered past. I tried to get out of the way moving to the side of the narrow alleyway but she nearly took my eye out with the edge of her umbrella. Frankly if I'd been blinded and the lat thing I'd seen was her then I'd have been happy. After consulting the predictive power of the monks at the Todai-ji temple in Nara, where clearly having the world's largest wooden building containing a vast statue of Buddha was regarded as insufficient to match the competition, I caught a series of slow trains to Tokyo in the knowledge that it was \"a good time to travel\". I was impatient to reach the great Electric City and enviously watched the Shinkansen bullet trains as they hurtled past on the parallel tracks. It's not just that I want to see what kind of electric baths the megawatt obsessed residents of Tokyo have. I'm curious to find out exactly what this \"unexpected good luck\" is that the monks in Nara say is heading my way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
