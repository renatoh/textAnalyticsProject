From a betting point of view, however, Alan King has been the man to follow so far this jumps season, and if anyone can stop Nicholls completing a big-race treble this weekend, it will probably be the man from Barbury Castle stables in Wiltshire. A \u00a31 bet on all of King's runners this season is currently showing a profit of nearly \u00a348, following the 4-1 success at Hereford of Pennek, the only runner he sent out yesterday. Last season, meanwhile, his yard showed a profit of \u00a363 to level stake, and the year before that, a loss - of just 70 pence. King is a trainer whose horses not only win regularly, but do so at the right sort of price, though the man himself insists that \"I know absolutely nothing about betting and take no interest in it all\". He will probably have a favourite on his hands this weekend, though, when Voy Por Ustedes, the winner of the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival back in March, lines up for the Grade One Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown. Last year in the same race, Voy Por Ustedes was seven lengths behind Kauto Star, but while the Gold Cup winner remains among the entries for the Tingle Creek, he is an unlikely runner. In his absence, Voy Por Ustedes will start favourite ahead of Nicholls's Twist Magic, in a race that he will also need to win to stand a serious chance of winning the British Horseracing Authority's jumping Order of Merit. \"Kauto Star beat us in this race last year,\" King said yesterday, \"but the difference then was that our horse was having his first race of the season. This time around, I was desperate to get a race into him to get a bit of the fizz out of him, as he can be a bit exuberant, so we went to [a handicap at] Cheltenham. He put up a smashing performance there, he was beaten a neck and he seems really well and in good form now. \"That run seems to have done the trick . He'll work tomorrow, and we're looking forward to Saturday. All being well, he'll follow exactly the same route after that, going to Kempton on the 27th [of December], then to Newbury for the Game Spirit and on to the Queen Mother.\" Ashley Brook, the runner-up to Kauto Star in the Tingle Creek two years ago, was confirmed a definite runner yesterday by Kevin Bishop, his trainer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
