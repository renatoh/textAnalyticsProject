Less than a fortnight ago Shreeves, now 61, pulled into the north London suburb again, this time with Martin Allen in tow, and the pair were hired for the season as head coach and first-team coach of a club who slipped out of the Nationwide League last season, an unusual career move that presumably had little to do with money for a man who had started the season managing Sheffield Wednesday and who 10 years ago this week was attempting to steer Tottenham into the last four of the European Cup Winners' Cup. \"Feyenoord did a tight man-marking job on Gary Lineker that night and we couldn't get the goals, but I enjoyed it all then and I'm still enjoying this now,\" he said. \"Everyone seems amazed but I'm happy working at Barnet. I like the club, it's a 25-minute drive from where I live and the signs are good.\" Last week's certainly were as the council finally approved plans to develop green-belt land adjacent to Underhill for a 9,000-seat stadium, though there are a couple of hurdles still to overcome, and his players then peeled off a second successive win to move into eighth place after a run of six games without a win. \"We've managed to stop the indifferent results,\" Shreeves added. \"These are young boys who can be coached and though it wasn't that evident today it will be as time goes on. They can all get the ball down and pass it.\" Saturday was more a case of hanging on in a swirling wind against the more experienced Morecambe side. But late on Shreeves changed all that. After Stuart Niven was introduced in midfield to be followed by Toby Oshitola up front, Barnet carved out two decent chances in as many minutes, the first saved but the second taken by the 18-year-old striker in only his second senior appearance. Man of the match: Lee Flynn (Barnet)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
