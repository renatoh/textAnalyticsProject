Complaints to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for universities increased to 734 last year compared with 586 in 2006, with more international students and older postgraduate students complaining about the quality of education they receive. \"Barristers and solicitor firms who actively seek to represent students who have a complaint also contributed to the rise,\" said Lady Deech, the chief adjudicator. A new \"litigation culture\" saw the same handful of legal firms representing many students making complaints, she said. The number of complaints was relatively low given that there were 1 million students in universities overall, but most complaints were resolved at university level, she added. The proportion upheld rose from 19% in 2006 to 26% in 2007. Some 64% of the complaints were about academic results. Disciplinary matters and plagiarism - such as students wrongly accused of cheating - accounted for 11%. Medical students were most likely to complain. Lady Deech said many students now believed they needed a 2:1 or first to get a good job. \"The rise in the number of complaints is due to many more students challenging their degree and exam results,\" she said. \"This is probably because there are so many more graduates emerging onto the job market now that graduating with, say, a lower second, is insufficient for success. They want very good marks in order to stand out.\" The rise in complaints could also be down to the increase in mature, graduate and international students who are more likely to complain about the standard of education. \"Older students might have given up a job and will be more focused on the employment prospects than the life experience that 18- or 19-year-olds get at university.\" Six in 10 complaints were from students over 25 years old. Around \u00a3173,000 in compensation was recommended to be paid to complainants following adjudications. The figures are contained in an annual report by the OIA due to be published in full next week. The government last night published details of students' views from \"student juries\" held across the country to influence government policy. Students voiced concerns about information on fees, and about their degree courses. The minister for students Lady Morgan, said: \"We need to hear students' views so that we can help improve the university experience for them and future learners.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
