To win it will mean an awful lot\u2019", "bodyText": "On the roof of the Shankly hotel in Liverpool, they were on top of the world. The afternoon sun had long been replaced by heavy clouds. And finally, briefly, it rained when Divock Origi secured Liverpool\u2019s sixth European cup. It rained beer. Cups hurled in the air in triumph. It rained tears: of incredulous joy from some, overwhelmed by reprieve from the agonising limbo of a precarious one nil. It was party time. Around 2,000 people gathered at the hotel named after the club\u2019s most famous manager Bill Shankly. At least three floors were turned into packed viewing areas, where fans had gathered steadily all day. Many brought the banners they usually take to Anfield, plastering the walls with red and white flags and inflatable Champions League trophies. On the rooftop terrace the drinks had been flowing and didn\u2019t stop as kick-off approached and the nerves went into overdrive . With his floppy hair, black-rimmed glasses and wide mouth full of glistening teeth, Frank McCabe spent the afternoon posing for selfies. The 55-year-old retired scientist played up to his J\u00fcrgen Klopp look-a-like status with a shrug and a grin. \u201cIf I let my stubble grow a bit more and wear my other glasses I get it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cI even know a few German phrases to throw in. Football transcends everything in this city. To win it will mean an awful lot.\u201d Not everyone donned red football shirts. The high heels and designer dress quota was reminiscent of Ladies\u2019 Day at Aintree. Mani Aulakh and her husband Jag watched with their children Tia, two, and Rio, 10 months. \u201cJag is a massive Liverpool fan,\u201d says Mani, in a black T-shirt with the \u201cNever give up\u201d slogan worn by Mohamed Salah before the semi-final win over Barcelona. \u201cI\u2019m from Birmingham and we live in Warrington but I had the kids in the Liverpool women\u2019s hospital so it says Liverpool on their passports.\u201d Jag, juggling a beer in one hand and his baby son in the other, showed commendable coordination to punch the sky when Salah\u2019s early penalty hit the back of the net. The pre-game carnival fizzled into jitters, bursts of singing and the occasional request to the heavens as the game wore on. One nil felt had certainly felt precarious for Tracey Roberts, from Prenton, Wirral, who was so on edge her vodka and tonic went untouched. With every stray pass she flinched. Gradually she watched from behind her hands. When the Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker was forced into a late save, the previously forgotten vodka was quickly swigged. By the end, as deafening choruses of \u201cAllez, allez, allez\u201d drowned out the commentary, Tracey was up and dancing. Then Gerry Marsden kicked in. That old ubiquitous soundtrack of this club, accompanied by the acrid smell of red flares as fireworks crackled in the sky. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone played long into the night. Not, perhaps, the best for dancing. It didn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d says Nick Taft, from Bala in North Wales, who jigged on the spot like a man possessed. \u201cI was born in Liverpool and just felt I had to be here tonight. It\u2019s like every Liverpool fan worldwide who isn\u2019t in Madrid flocked to the city. It\u2019s so special.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
