A lesson in lunchtime etiquette", "bodyText": "\u2022 We know how austerity bites at what were so inelegantly dubbed bog -standard comprehensives. But if anyone believes the problems are restricted to the state sector, they can think again. The alumni of Francis Holland school, in Belgravia \u2013 described by Tatler as \"jet-set and privileged\" \u2013 include Jemima Khan, Vanessa Mae and Sienna Miller. Fees exceed \u00a35,000 a term. But the pressing problems of our age, financial, environmental, affect life there too. The result is a memorandum, a guide to \"lunchtime etiquette\" that's causing some disquiet. A \"delicate matter\", it admits, but a few things need bearing in mind. \"Some staff are taking food from the lunch bar and putting it in their bags for later,\" reports the head Lucy Elphinstone. \"And others are taking up to four or five pieces of fruit from the girls' bowl in the main dining room on their way out after lunch.\" Some \"are taking hot food from the girls' servery if they spy something which is not offered to the staff\". This too must stop. And there is too much waste: a terrible state of affairs both practically and morally, especially as all the meat is free-range. Not problems all schools will specifically recognise, perhaps. But in this brutish time of scarce resources, we share the pain. \u2022 Something of an I'm-just-an-ordinary Joe offensive being waged by the prime minister at the moment. There was that laugh-a-minute gagfest he delivered to the parliamentary press corps last week. And this weekend: information about the music he likes, how he likes to channel-surf, and his parenting regime. It's the return of the artist formerly known as Call Me Dave. But how much of this is to be believed? The prime minister raised his biggest laugh last week with a tale from a voter's doorstep, accompanying Boris Johnson. The woman said: \"Boris, you're the father of one of my children.\" Only after allowing Boris to flounder did she add. \"It's your daughter; I'm her maths teacher.\" But did it ever happen? Boris, challenged yesterday by Nick Ferrari on the London radio station LBC, cast doubt. \"I had no memory of the incident in question,\" he said. \"I cannot categorically deny that it took place.\" Are you suggesting the prime minister is economical with the truth, pressed Ferrari. \"I am being very careful with my words,\" said London's mayor. \"So often do I campaign shoulder to shoulder with the prime minister that it is possible anything could have happened.\" Which is probably not what he said off air. \u2022 The government seems determined to push ahead with fracking. And what will be the benefits? Jobs for a start, say ministers. How many jobs? They're not quite sure. What estimate has the Department of Energy and Climate Change made of the jobs to be created by fracking in Lancashire and the UK in the next decade, asked MP Nigel Evans. \"The department has not made such an estimate,\" said Michael Fallon. Which is rendered curious by the release circulated by the department just before Christmas. \"There would be beneficial impacts to the economy, jobs and communities,\" it said. \"Employment in the oil and gas industry could be increased by 7%, with 16,000 to 32,000 full-time jobs created.\" Who was the minister sent forth to gush on that occasion \u2026 Michael Fallon. \u2022 With Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond toe to toe, one wonders if the debate over Scottish independence needs more characters. But who can stop Mohamed Al Fayed from joining the slugfest? His offer is an independent Scotland's very own statue of liberty. It stems from his belief that the Scots are descended from an Egyptian princess. He has already commissioned his official sculptor to create an image of the legendary Princess Scota. \"When Scotland becomes independent it will need a female symbol to personify its greatest characteristics \u2013 courage, foresight and intelligence,\" he says. And it is predicted that if Scotland votes yes, he will apply for citizenship. The Scots might do it anyway. \u2022 Finally, congrats to Anglian Water, winner of a prestigious Green Economy Award for water efficiency. It aims to reduce leakage from its own pipes \u2013 by 0.5% between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Way to go, Anglian.
