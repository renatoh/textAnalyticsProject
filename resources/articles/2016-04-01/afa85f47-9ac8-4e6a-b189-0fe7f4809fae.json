The suit was first reported by local WDRB news, which named the plaintiffs as Kashiya Nwanguma, 21, Molly Shah, 36, and Henry Brousseau, 17. The suit reads in part: \u201cEach time he said \u2018get them out,\u2019 Trump intended for his supporters to use unwanted, harmful physical violence to remove protesters.\u201d The suit names two men specifically besides Trump, including one described as a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d, and who wrote in a blog post that he helped \u201cthe crowd drive out one of the women\u201d. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders raised $44m in March, slightly more than the $43.5m he raised in February. More than 97% of the money was raised online, the campaign said in a statement, and in all Sanders has received more than 6.5m contributions from 2 million donors. Campaign contributions have increasingly become an issue in the Democratic race, as Sanders and Hillary Clinton have fought over who gives them money. Most recently, Clinton said she is \u201csick of the Sanders campaign\u2019s lies\u201d that she receives money from fossil fuel interests. Sanders defended his campaign from claims by Clinton that it was spreading \u201clies\u201d about donations from the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf people receive money from lobbyists of the industry, I think you\u2019re receiving money from the industry,\u201d Sanders told CBS\u2019s This Morning show. Trump may have walked back comments saying that \u201cyeah, there has to be some form\u201d of legal punishment for women who have had abortions, but a women\u2019s health organization has already cut an advertisement that highlights the candidate\u2019s inflammatory comments for potential voters: An Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino workers\u2019 union has endorsed Sanders - despite the fact that the casino industry in the seaside town was largely built by Trump. \u201cMy coworkers and I are in a fight with billionaire Carl Icahn to keep our health care at the Tropicana and win back health care at the Trump Taj Mahal,\u201d union member Rodney Mills told the Press of Atlantic City. Unite Here Local 54 represents about 10,000 hospitality workers. That\u2019s it for today - we\u2019ll be back on Sunday with more minute-by-minute coverage from the campaign trail. A campaign surrogate for billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump told CNN\u2019s New Day that the overturning of Roe v. Wade - the 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion across the US - is \u201cnot gonna happen.\u201d Chris Collins, a New York congressman who was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, called Roe v. Wade \u201cthe settled law of the land.\u201d \u201cThat kind of hypothetical, \u2018gotcha\u2019 question is frankly not appropriate,\u201d Collins said. More uncomfortable news for Donald Trump on the delegate front... According to a report from Politico, North Dakota\u2019s selection of its 25 Republican delegates this weekend at its state party convention \u201ctilts the playing field\u201d in favor of Texas senator Ted Cruz. Why? Because North Dakota doesn\u2019t hold a primary or a caucus. Instead, a small group of party insiders hand-pick the delegates at the state convention, a process that shuts out North Dakota Republican voters entirely and makes it tricky for an outsider candidate to win over precious delegates. Those delegates will be unbound during the Republican National Convention this summer, which means that winning over Roughrider State Republicans at the convention could be a key component of Trump\u2019s plan to prevent a second ballot. \u201cWe basically honor our party elders,\u201d Curly Haugland, the RNC committeeman from North Dakota, told Politico. \u201cThe likelihood of a newbie getting in is slim.\u201d A super-PAC working in support of billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has released a new television advertisement focused on national security in the waning days of the primary campaign in delegate-rich Wisconsin, writing off primary opponent Ted Cruz as a candidate who \u201clet in more Syrian refugees and give more amnesty to illegal immigrants.\u201d In Great America PAC\u2019s ad, a mother serving an after-school snack to her children tells viewers that after \u201cParis, San Bernardino and now Brussels,\u201d she wants \u201ca president that will keep us safe.\u201d \u201cWe need to control our borders and stop letting in dangerous people - Trump will do that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Ted Cruz? He wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give more amnesty to illegal immigrants. That won\u2019t protect my family. Donald Trump will.\u201d An Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino workers\u2019 union has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders - despite the fact that the casino industry in the seaside town was largely built by Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. \u201cMy coworkers and I are in a fight with billionaire Carl Icahn to keep our health care at the Tropicana and win back health care at the Trump Taj Mahal,\u201d union member Rodney Mills told the Press of Atlantic City. \u201cWe need elected leaders that are going to stand up for working people and Bernie Sanders is the best candidate for the job.\u201d Icahn, a friend of Trump\u2019s, bought the Taj Mahal casino after the real estate tycoon-turned presidential candidate declared bankruptcy. \u201cIt is an honor to receive Unite Here Local 54\u2019s endorsement,\u201d the Sanders campaign declared in a statement. \u201cThis campaign is building a movement of millions of Americans who are demanding that our economy works for everyone, not just the top one percent. The hard-working men and women of New Jersey\u2019s hospitality industry are a vital part of our movement which is spreading to every corner of our country.\u201d Unite Here Local 54 represents about 10,000 hospitality workers, but they won\u2019t be able to vote until June 7, the date of the New Jersey primary. Vermont senator and Brooklyn native Bernie Sanders has joined the annoyingly pervasive debate over whether it is acceptable to eat pizza with utensils or your own hands, declaring that he\u2019s more of a hands-on pizza eater. \u201cThis is a tough \u2018gotcha\u2019 question you\u2019re asking me - I myself prefer it without the fork,\u201d Sanders told a local Fox affiliate in New York City. \u201cI know we\u2019re probably going to lose millions of votes here, but nonetheless I\u2019m for picking it up and eating it.\u201d The conversation began after Republican presidential candidate John Kasich was spotted using a fork and knife at a New York pizza joint, incurring the mockery of pizza-loving locals. \u201cLook, look, the pizza came scalding hot, OK? And so I use a little fork,\u201d the governor told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cYou know what? My wife who is on spring break with my daughters said, \u2018I\u2019m proud of you. You finally learned how to use a utensil properly.\u2019 But I mean - not only did I eat the pizza, I had the hot sausage. It was fantastic.\u201d Donald Trump may have walked back comments saying that \u201cyeah, there has to be some form\u201d of legal punishment for women who have had abortions, but a women\u2019s health organization has already cut an advertisement that highlights the candidate\u2019s inflammatory comments for potential voters. \u201cDonald Trump says he would ban abortion and, in his words, impose \u2018some form of punishment\u2019 on women who have them,\u201d the video, released by the National Institute for Reproductive Health Action Fund, says in a voiceover as women queue up for mugshots. \u201cWe have questions, Donald Trump,\u201d the voiceover continues. \u201cIf you make abortion a crime, doesn\u2019t that make women criminals? How much time should she do? Would you put her doctor in jail, too?\u201d Trump has since retracted those comments, saying that he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d Running for public office can often feel like a popularity contest - and billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is banking on it. In an Instagram video released today, the real estate magnate mocks his primary rival Ted Cruz as the least-popular person in Washington, DC, and possibly the country. \u201cDoes anybody like Lyin\u2019 Ted?\u201d the caption asks, apparently rhetorically, as the video lists off colleagues, endorsers and former college roommates who really, really dislike the Texas senator. A list of some of the people who don\u2019t like Cruz, according to the video: Cruz\u2019s college roommate: \u201cI did not like him at all in college.\u201d Former senator Bob Dole: \u201cI might oversleep that day\u201d if Cruz wins the Republican nomination. Lindsey Graham: \u201cI think he\u2019s been just as wrong as Obama, if not worse.\u201d George W. Bush: \u201cIt\u2019s been widely reported that he didn\u2019t like you,\u201d according to Bill O\u2019Reilly. Hey, Harvard Law isn\u2019t a a charm school. Clinton runs down another list of crowd favorites: supporting unions and teachers, equal pay for women, etc. \u201cWe should be raising taxes on the wealthy!\u201d \u201cAnd you know what, I\u2019m the only candidate running on either side who has promised I will not raise taxes on the middle class,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am going after the wealthy and the super-rich to get them to pay their share of supporting our country.\u201d The Clintons themselves are extraordinarily wealthy, though they entered the White House in the 1990s with a more modest net worth. \u201cUpstate New York had one of the most storied histories in manufacturing, we all know that,\u201d Clinton tells the Syracuse crowd. She wants to create an \u201cinfrastructure bank\u201d. \u201cWe now have a chance to recapture that with a renaissance in manufacturing,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe will not only provide incentives to send jobs back but I will penalize companies that send jobs away.\u201d Then she segues into energy \u2013 without mention of her fossil fuel feud with Bernie Sanders. \u201cThere are millions of jobs and businesses\u201d in developing renewable energy, she says, adding that she wants enough clean energy to power US homes by the end of her second term. She admits that she\u2019s thinking \u201cbig\u201d here, as she has not yet won her first term. Someone\u2019s going to revolutionize energy, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be China, Germany or us, and I want it to be us.\u201d Hillary Clinton is speaking in Syracuse, New York, saying: \u201cThis is one of the most consequential presidential elections we\u2019ve had in a long time. The stakes are so high.\u201d \u201cYou all took a chance on me back in 2000, and that meant the world to me,\u201d she says, referring to her first Senate election. She keeps up the pro-New York rhetoric. \u201cYou can knock us down but you can\u2019t keep us down, we\u2019re always getting up, we\u2019re always moving forward.\u201d She gives a couple nods to the college teams, saying the country should be more like the Syracuse Orange. Then she points out that she\u2019s the only woman in the race, and starts drawing contrasts, implicitly, with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t work, blame people. It\u2019s us versus them.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to have any part of that. I\u2019m also not going to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I don\u2019t believe in that either!\u201d Meanwhile a new Gallup poll has found some data that Clinton will likely appreciate. Rounding out the carousel of politics on late night shows, Bernie Sanders visited Stephen Colbert on Thursday night \u2013 a day after Elizabeth Warren stopped by and Ted Cruz met Jimmy Kimmel. Colbert introduced Sanders as a \u201cmystery guest\u201d, delivered to the show by the \u201cwheel of news\u201d he spins on the odd occasion. The senator from Vermont then emerged out of darkness and fog \u2013 and promptly gave his pitch to win superdelegates who have tentatively committed to Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe have won six out of the last seven caucuses, most of which were by landslide victories,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the superdelegates should listen to the will of the people. If you get 60, 70, 80% of the vote in a state, I think superdelegates should vote for us.\u201d \u201cWe are the strongest candidate, I believe, in taking on any Republican candidate,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI would hope that superdelegates take a look at who the strongest Democratic candidate is, and you know what, that\u2019s me.\u201d Then Sanders burst: \u201cI would like to spin that damn wheel!\u201d He walked behind the desk toward a prop lever, and then pointed down below the desk: \u201cHey \u2013 there is a human being down here! What is going on? What are you doing to this worker? Brandon the Late Show employee: \u201cHelp me, Bernie.\u201d Sanders: \u201cWhat kind of operation are you running, Stephen?\u201d Then he shot a T-shirt cannon. A day after angrily criticizing Donald Trump, John Kasich has just about attacked Ted Cruz too \u2013 finally dropping his role as the relentlessly positive Republican. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign manager has called on Hillary Clinton to apologize, as the spat over campaign finances heads to MSNBC. \u201cI think she probably owes the senator an apology for that because the senator is not lying about her record,\u201d Jeff Weaver told the network. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about her record. He\u2019s talking about her practices. She obviously doesn\u2019t like it, but that doesn\u2019t make it lying because you don\u2019t like it.\u201d Clinton has made the distinction between fossil fuel corporations and employees of those companies; FEC documents show that she has received more than $307,000 from those employees. Sanders has received about $54,000, the documents show. The candidates receive far more money from workers in other industries. In a statement released by the campaign, Weaver elaborated that he means both employees and lobbyists, and cited a Greenpeace study that tabulates a much broader range of donations, totaling more than $4m. People who work in securities and investments by far donate the most ($21m) to Clinton, documents show, while retired people ($3m) and those who work in education ($2.5m) have given the most to Sanders. \u201cIf the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won\u2019t affect her decisions if she\u2019s elected, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary\u2019s fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\u201d Three protesters have sued Donald Trump for inciting violence against them at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, alleging that he encouraged his supporters to attack them. The suit was first reported by local WDRB news, which named the plaintiffs as Kashiya Nwanguma, 21, Molly Shah, 36, and Henry Brousseau, 17. It was filed in the Jefferson Circuit Court, and reads in part: \u201cEach time he said \u2018get them out,\u2019 Trump intended for his supporters to use unwanted, harmful physical violence to remove protesters.\u201d The suit names two men specifically besides Trump, including one described as a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d, and who wrote in a blog post that he helped \u201cthe crowd drive out one of the women\u201d. Brosseau claims he was punched by someone with that man, and \u201csince that time experienced anxiety and nightmares\u201d. Shah alleges she was \u201cshoved and pushed by multiple Trump supporters\u201d, and \u201cexperienced pain and difficulty sleeping\u201d.. Police reports were made but there have been no charges, according to the suit. Video posted online shows Nwanguma shoved by one or several people. One of the men accused of pushing a protester later apologized, according to the suit, which says he wrote a letter: \u201cI physically pushed a young woman down the aisle toward the exit, an action I sincerely regret.\u201d Other videos show similar patterns of violence, including sucker punches by Trump supporters against protesters under escort by police, scuffles in crowds, and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbing a female reporter. Florida police charged Lewandowski with simple battery. Wisconsin police are looking for two suspects involved in a violent incident at a Trump rally: a teenage protester was pepper-sprayed in the face by one, and allegedly groped by another. Trump has said he does not condone violence. He has also said he would pay for the legal fees of supporters involved in incidents, and said that he loves \u201cthe old days\u201d when protesters would \u201cbe carried out on a stretcher\u201d. Hillary Clinton is in Syracuse, New York, at a roundtable meeting to discuss her plan to restore manufacturing jobs in the US \u2013 the industry continues to shrink even as the overall economy inches along a recovery. Reporters for ABC, the AP and Bloomberg are with her. Who is Donald Trump\u2019s right-hand man, so loyal to the businessman that Trump defended him even after a criminal charge of battery and clear video that the aide lied? My colleague Ed Pilkington investigates the unlikely rise of Corey Lewandowski within the most surreal presidential campaign in modern political history. The name the businessman landed on for his campaign was pure Trump: a former lobbyist for the seafood industry who had never run a national campaign, who had staged debates in public with a cardboard cutout, and whose only claim to fame was sneaking a gun into the US Capitol. Lewandowski\u2019s approach to the campaign is summed up in a simple slogan that so far has proved to be devastatingly effective: \u201cLet Trump be Trump\u201d. Yet the dynamic could just as well be reversed: Trump has run his campaign under the rubric \u201cLet Lewandowski be Lewandowski\u201d. That logic was played out this week when Trump continued to defend Lewandowski even after his campaign manager had committed the cardinal sin of any political sidekick by becoming the story. On Tuesday, police in Jupiter, Florida, charged the aide with simple battery after Lewandowski was accused by a reporter for a pro-Trump rightwing website of forcefully grabbing her at a rally. The details of the alleged incident are grubby. The former reporter for Breitbart, Michelle Fields, was trailing after Trump asking him questions at the end of a press conference on 8 March when she was suddenly yanked by the arm by a man with a buzzcut answering to the description of Lewandowski. A social media firestorm ensued in which Trump\u2019s campaign manager accused Fields of being \u201cdelusional\u201d. The subsequent release by Jupiter police of video footage captured by Trump\u2019s own security cameras at the hotel venue clearly showed Lewandowski grabbing Fields and pulling her away from the candidate. Not least, it fits a pattern of low-level bullying-cum-violence that has become a feature of Trump rallies. The Red Bull-chugging Lewandowski has himself been reported as havingphysically manhandled protesters at campaign events, as well as showing a disdain for reporters and their public function that borders on thuggery. After Politico published a piece raising concerns about his conduct, the news site found one of its named reportersturned away at the door. All of which has made Lewandowski the poster boy for a new type of politics that over the past six months Trump has unleashed on a stunned and increasingly confused America. It has left other political professionals bemused, includingseasoned practitioners such as John Weaver, a veteran of both of John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns who is now acting as chief strategist to Trump\u2019s rival John Kasich. \u201cI have never heard of a campaign manager in politics getting involved in tugging, pulling, hitting demonstrators or reporters,\u201d Weaver told the Guardian. \u201cMaybe Lewandowski is confusing his job with professional wrestling, I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing any services to politics.\u201d So how did Trump manage to find such a perfect embodiment of his unorthodox approach in Corey Lewandowski? The two men met in 2014 in New Hampshire, where Lewandowski was working as state director of Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-leaning group funded by billionaire rightwing agitators the Koch brothers. A spark must have passed between them, though you have to assume it wasn\u2019t based on Trump\u2019s admiration for the younger man\u2019s experience in running successful political campaigns, as Lewandowski had very little. In fact, he hadn\u2019t run a campaign for a dozen years before joining the real estate tycoon\u2019s cause. In 1994, Lewandowski ran his own failed campaign for a seat on the Massachusetts state legislature. In 2002, Lewandowski organized the failed primary campaign of then New Hampshire senator Bob Smith. A two-term senator best known for waving a plastic fetus on the Senate floor, Smith had run a long-shot presidential campaign and then briefly defected from the Republican party. On his return to the GOP, he faced a primary challenge from John E Sununu, a three-term congressman whose father John H Sununu was a former governor of New Hampshire. In an interview with the Guardian in August, Smith praised Lewandowski as being \u201cvery much a people person\u201d. He noted similarities between his campaign and the Trump effort in that \u201cthe so-called establishment of the party was not supportive of my candidacy\u201d either. His insistence that he sees no problem with his own public posture \u2013 the word \u201cabrasive\u201d is often applied to him \u2013 is telling. Lewandowski is convinced that he is one of a new breed of political animal that is challenging the complacent old guard of establishment politicians and their bag handlers. Out in LA the once tightly knit club of entertainment conservatives is splitting at the seams, my colleague Rory Carroll reports. No longer united against the liberal hordes at film sets and studio offices, they\u2019ve now split into segments over the race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. \u201cIt\u2019s a civil war in slow motion,\u201d said Lionel Chetwynd, a producer and screenwriter and co-founder of FOA. \u201cIt\u2019s too volatile. I\u2019ve never known an election to be so personal. People don\u2019t really sit around any more and talk about their preferences because it\u2019s a time of inflamed passions. Now I don\u2019t talk much to my Republican friends.\u201d \u201cA few of my conservative friends told me to lay low over the Trump stuff,\u201d said Jack Marino, an actor and writer who champions Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s like a big FU vote to Washington. I\u2019ve lost one friend, a big Cruz guy who hates Trump. It\u2019s silly for friendships to break up over politics.\u201d David Cole, who used to run a bacchanalian group called Republican Party Animals, said the various splintering factions were \u201cone primary away from needing a benzodiazepine drip\u201d. The \u201calternative right\u201d had a racial animus now emboldened by Trump\u2019s xenophobia, Cole said. \u201cThe base as I know it is fractured. People are at each other\u2019s throats.\u201d Infighting has convulsed Breitbart.com, an influential rightwing news and opinion site that serves as a noticeboard for LA\u2019s conservatives. When the Guardian visited Breitbart\u2019s LA headquarters, a small, compact set of offices in Brentwood, there was no visible sign of tumult. Behind an unmarked door \u2013 no sign or plaque \u2013 a handful of mostly young people worked on computers, casting occasional glances at mute televisions. Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart writer and self-styled provocateur, expressed delight at the divisions roiling Republicans. \u201cI don\u2019t want the wounds to heal. I want the American right to be ripped in half, just like I want the American left to be ripped in half. We need new formulations. The Republican party is no longer fit for purpose. If you\u2019re conservative the Republican party can\u2019t deliver you the government that you want.\u201d Several celebrities including Jon Voight, Stephen Baldwin and Kid Rock have publicly endorsed Trump but it has hardly been a stampede. According to Yiannopoulos, much support is hidden in the same way British voters conceal Tory preferences from pollsters. \u201cMiddle and upper classes don\u2019t like to express their anger, and Hollywood is nothing if not snobbish.\u201d Another reason was fear of liberal retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s profoundly dangerous. It can get you blacklisted.\u201d Author Bret Easton Ellis, best known for the 1991 satire of Wall Street, American Psycho, tweeted a similar observation. Cole, the former Republican Party Animals ringmaster, suggested it was Trump critics who were lying low. \u201cAn essential element to being pro-Trump is despising the establishment, so for that reason a lot of pro-Trumps welcome the fight. They\u2019re driven by anger, and anger is a difficult emotion to hide and a satisfying one to indulge in. Conversely, I know several anti-Trumpers who are purposely staying silent because it\u2019s not pretty to arouse the ire of the pro-Trumpers.\u201d For all the anger and resentment, many think this is just a phase, not a terminal breach, and that come summer the nomination \u2013 be it Trump, Cruz or someone else \u2013 will restore peace of sorts to Hollywood Republicans. \u201cI think the air will clear,\u201d said Chetwynd, the screenwriter. \u201cThe people I know will do anything to prevent another Democratic term, particularly if it\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\u201d Vermont senator Bernie Sanders raised $44m in March, his campaign reported on Friday, slightly more than the $43.5m he raised in February. Over 97% of the money was raised online, the campaign said in a statement, and in all Sanders has received more than 6.5m contributions from 2 million donors. The pace of his fundraising has slowed however rate of acceleration of his fundraising has slowed, however \u2013 in January he raised $21.3m \u2013 and Hillary Clinton continues to raise large amounts, including $15m in January and $30m in February. Her campaign has not yet released its March financial information. Campaign contributions have increasingly become an issue in the Democratic race, as Sanders and Clinton have fought over who gives them money. Most recently, Clinton said she is \u201csick of the Sanders campaign\u2019s lies\u201d that she receives money from fossil fuel interests. She made the distinction that employees of fossil fuel companies have given money to her; to a lesser extent they have also given money to Sanders. Sanders has meanwhile boasted of the huge numbers of small donations that have fueled his campaign. \u201cWhat this campaign is doing is bringing together millions of people contributing an average of just $27 each to take on a billionaire class which is so used to buying elections,\u201d he said in a statement. Both candidates have urged the repeal of a 2010 supreme court decision that allowed unlimited corporate donations to organizations that obscure the sources of their money. Clarification: Initially, this post described the pace of Sanders\u2019 fundraising as having slowed. This was not correct - what has slowed is the rate of acceleration in the increase in donations to his political campaign, month-over-month. In other words, Sanders\u2019 $500,000 jump in donations from February to March is much smaller than his $22.2m jump in donations from January to February. Kasich is doing just about everything in his power to distinguish himself from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, two opponents derided by many in their party. On immigration. \u201cI don\u2019t like that people have broken the law to get here,\u201d he says, with a nod to how the border must be \u201csecured\u201d. \u201cIf we build a wall, if we have modern security, we don\u2019t want anybody just being able to walk into this country illegally.\u201d But then he proposes \u201ca guest worker program\u201d, and what his rivals would call \u201camnesty\u201d (he doesn\u2019t say that word). \u201cFor the 11 and a half million that are here, if they haven\u2019t committed a crime,\u201d Kasich says, \u201cyou make \u2018em pay a crime and their back taxes, and you put them on a path to citizenship.\u201d Then he derides Trump\u2019s plan to deport undocumented people, without saying Trump\u2019s name. He says it\u2019s wildly impractical, and dangerous, to \u201cdrive police around neighborhoods yanking people out of their homes and shipping them across the border to the tune of 11 and a half million.\u201d He casts more aspersion on Trump: \u201cyou can\u2019t divide people on the basis of their faith. You cannot say if I don\u2019t get picked at the convention there will be riots. This is bizarre, folks.\u201d Then he tells the room \u2013 almost entirely white, from the perspective of the camera \u2013 \u201cour friends in the minority community cannot be neglected\u201d. He says too many white people don\u2019t think minorities work hard enough, and too many nonwhite people believe institutions actively work against them. \u201cThat has to stop,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cWe have to give everybody a chance to rise.\u201d He concludes with more derision in the direction of an unnamed businessman from Queens. \u201cI could point to how horrible everything is,\u201d he says. \u201cI can do it. Or I can choose to come in here and tell you there are solutions.\u201d John Kasich is doing a town hall event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, home of the chocolate factory and attendant theme park. He\u2019s talking about drug abuse and education, and suggests that residents could prevent addiction easily. \u201cYou just grab these kids and you explain to them the dangers of drugs,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have somebody come from Harrisburg to tell you how to do it.\u201d His rhetoric mirrors that of Nancy Reagan\u2019s in the 1980s, when she led a \u201cJust Say No\u201d program to warn young people about drugs. But meta-studies of these programs, including Dare, have found they are largely ineffective. Kasich doesn\u2019t expand, though, on what sort of talks he thinks would help people recover from addiction or prevent drug abuse. Instead, he says parents and educators need to be mores supportive. \u201cThat\u2019s how you change a life, that\u2019s how you give a kid confidence.\u201d He recalls hearing from neighbors, \u201cJohnny, someday you\u2019re going to be something.\u2019\u201d I remember that, that was 50 years ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to give you the power to fix your own education.\u201d Then he moves on to talking about the budget, looking nostalgically back to his days in Congress. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a little secret. Democrats love to spend. Republicans love to spend too, they just feel guilty when they do it.\u201d He says surplus money should go to help the neediest \u2013 he\u2019s invoking the kind of \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d that George W Bush once hailed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the mentally ill ought to sleep under a bridge or in a prison,\u201d he says. \u201cWe treat the drug addicted in our prisons.\u201d \u201cAnd the working poor. Right now if you\u2019re a woman and you have a couple dis and you\u2019re barely getting by and on childcare,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can\u2019t take a pay raise because you lose your childcare.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nuts! We should give people in poverty a path to get out of poverty.\u201d Kasich uses this call, and his approach to Muslims, to contrast himself with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. He reproaches Cruz for saying police should \u201cpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d, and says Trump\u2019s notion of a religious test is nonsensical. He proposes instead asking Muslim Americans to help report terror suspects. Activist groups have called on corporations to drop their sponsorship of the Republican National Convention \u2013 and corporations are spooked by the violence and hate groups that have come to frequent Donald Trump events. Coca-Cola announced this week that it will not match the $660,000 it gave to the 2012 Republican convention, reducing its donation to $75,000. The company will also give $75,000 to the Democratic convention. Walmart, which gave $150,000 to the last convention, has yet to announce its plans. Microsoft, Bank of America and oil interests were also among the top donors in 2012. The New York Times first reported on the anxieties growing within corporations, including Google and Apple. \u201cI have talked to several people at companies who have said, \u2018I\u2019ve always gone to the convention, I\u2019ve always participated at some level, but this year we\u2019re not putting it in our budget, we\u2019re not going, we\u2019re not going to sponsor any of the events going on,\u2019\u201d said Carla Eudy, a Republican fund-raising consultant. The activists have called on more corporations to drop their support of the convention. Color of Change, led the effort to persuade Coca-Cola \u2013 including with a petition that had a bottle labeled \u201cShare a Coke with the KKK\u201d \u2013 is continuing the push. Its executive director, Rashad Robinson, said: \u201cLike Coca-Cola, other companies have a history-making choice in front of them right now.\u201d Trump has \u201ccontinued to be given a free pass by much of mainstream media and corporate sponsors\u201d, he added. \u201cThere is no greater threat to women and people of color in this country than Donald Trump,\u201d said Shaunna Thomas, a director at UltraViolet Action. \u201cIt makes no sense for Coca-Cola or other companies to even consider sponsoring Donald Trump.\u201d Cristobal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, said that sponsors should follow the example of Macy\u2019s and Univision, which cut ties with Trump after remarks branding Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d. \u201cThese corporate sponsors have a choice to make,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can either associate their brand with hate or they can do what\u2019s right and fight violence, intimidation, and bigotry.\u201d Bernie Sanders has defended his campaign from claims by Hillary Clinton that it was spreading \u201clies\u201d about donations from the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf people receive money from lobbyists of the industry, I think you\u2019re receiving money from the industry,\u201d Sanders told CBS\u2019s This Morning show. On Thursday Clinton told a Greenpeace activist: \u201cI do not have \u2013 I have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this,\u201d she added. In the Friday interview, Sanders cited Greenpeace research into Clinton\u2019s campaign finances. One Greenpeace study combines donations from people working for fossil fuel companies, donations from lobbyists who work for those companies, and \u201cfossil fuel interests\u201d to Super Pacs \u2013 in all over $4m, by Greenpeace\u2019s reckoning. Clinton\u2019s campaign has not received direct donations from fossil fuel companies, nor from Pacs linked to the industry, according to Factcheck.org. As she said on Thursday, however, she does receive contributions from workers of the industry. The Center for Responsive Politics has traced $307,561 given to Clinton by employees of fossil fuel companies, a tiny figure compared to what financiers and lawyers have given her: $21m and $14m respectively. Clinton has nearly $160m overall money raised, making donations from \u201cfossil fuel interests\u201d about 0.15% of the total. \u201cIf you are a lobby from the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cand there are 50 of you and you make a contribution, that to me, Charlie, is a contribution from the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s different from saying you get it from Exxon Mobil.\u201d He emphasized that these contributions were from \u201clobbyists who represent the oil and gas industry\u201d. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sanders has received about $54,000 from employees of fossil fuel companies. Republicans have received far more from employees of the fossil fuel industry. They have given Ted Cruz, for instance, more than $1.2m. You can read more from the interview here, and watch the confrontation below. Ted Cruz is off the trail for most of the day, but has three surrogates working in his stead. Heidi Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Utah Senator Mike Lee are stumping for him in Eau Claire, Appleton and La Crosse, Wisconsin. Cruz is scheduled to speak this afternoon at the Pennsylvania Leadership Council, a gathering of prominent Republicans, and to speak at a dinner hosted by the Republican party of Milwaukee this evening. John Kasich will campaign at a town hall in Hershey, Pennsylvania, at the Antique Automobile Club museum around 10am Eastern. He then heads up to Milwaukee to speak at the Republican dinner with Cruz. Bernie Sanders is holding a town hall in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, at 2pm Eastern, and hosting a rally in Green Bay at 5pm. Hillary Clinton is in Syracuse, New York, to hold a rally in the college town in blue-collar northern New York. The event is scheduled for 2pm Eastern, after which Clinton heads to New Jersey for a fundraiser. Bill Clinton is campaigning for her at 9.45 Central in Appleton, Wisconsin, and her campaign chairman is selling time to talk with him in Newtown, Pennsylvania, with a starting price of $500. Donald Trump is, for the second day running, off the trail. His campaign lists no public events until Saturday 2 April. Hello, and welcome to our rolling, April fools\u2019-less coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign. Donald Trump has tried to make nice with Republican leaders, Ted Cruz is gaining strength in the land of cheeseheads, and Hillary Clinton has said she is \u201csick of the Sanders campaign\u2019s lying\u201d. Trump met with the Republican party chair, Reince Priebus, to clear the air, according to reports from people inside the closed-door meeting. The Republican frontrunner has spent the week defending his campaign, mostly by stirring up more chaos. After he stood by his campaign manager, charged with assaulting a reporter, he reneged on his promise to support the eventual Republican nominee if it doesn\u2019t turn out to be him. Then he talked about letting Japan and South Korea develop nuclear weapons, breaking with the Geneva Conventions, and \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who seek illegal abortions. Reportedly, at the meeting Priebus explained the baroque battle over delegates to Trump, whose barebones campaign has frequently been outmaneuvered by Cruz\u2019s more experienced staffers. Each state has different rules about delegates, who are the representatives chosen by voters, party leaders or some mix when voters go to the polls. At the convention, delegates are bound to vote according to their state on the first ballot; afterward, they can vote for anyone (if their state permits). Also on Thursday, Priebus\u2019s committee created a website to handle frequently asked convention questions. The two other Republicans, Cruz and John Kasich, have gained strength but could each spoil the other\u2019s chances. Cruz has turned some of his ire toward the Ohio governor, and after weeks of hesitation Kasich has finally tried to confront Trump and court his voters. On the Democratic side, Clinton has split her time between Wisconsin, the next state to vote, and New York, the state with the second-most delegates. She grew frustrated with supporters of opponent Bernie Sanders on Thursday, boasting to them that she has more than 2 million more votes, and defending her record when confronted by a Greenpeace activist. \u201cI do not have, I have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m so sick, I\u2019m so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this. I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d Sanders hit the south Bronx on Thursday night, drawing thousands to a park just south of 149th street. The actor Rosario Dawson, a supporter, mocked criticisms of the Clinton campaign by noting the diversity of the crowd. \u201cShame on you, Hillary,\u201d she said, referring to the claim that Sanders is insufficiently supportive of women\u2019s rights. \u201cOh, sorry, hold on. Let me \u2018watch my tone\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
