Yet the days of mangled tapes and impenetrable timer systems could be at an end for TV recording seems finally set to go digital. Hard disk based video recording systems and DVD video recorders are moving steadily towards the mass market with prices for both expected to fall to under \u00a3200 by the end of next year. The systems are far superior to VHS in terms of ease of use and recording quality and both boast innovative features that are much more intelligent than even the most sophisticated tape-based machines. Hard disk based video systems debuted in the UK in October 2001 in the guise of the TiVo, a box that BBC Director General Greg Dyke predicted would change TV forever. Since then a host of manufacturers have unveiled similar products that allow consumers to record programmes on to a hard disk (usually around 40GB enough for around for 40 ours of programming). The recorders are often allied to easy-to-use electronic programming systems. Some work intelligently, guessing the kind of programmes viewers would like to see and then automatically recording them. After a hesitant start, sales of hard disk recorders are on the increase with both TiVo and Sky claiming healthy figures. Sky's Sky+ box (essentially a digital TV decoder with an integrated hard disk and programme guide) has apparently sold over 30,000, and with a price-cut for the crucial winter selling season, the broadcaster is confident that figure will rise significantly. By the end 2003, almost all the major consumer electronics manufacturers are expected to sell a hard disk recorder in their range and new features such as audio storage and the option of swapping recorded programmes via a broadband internet connection, could be available. The biggest weakness of hard disk recorders is that they only store programmes temporarily. So, in the short-term, the box that's most likely to supersede your VHS VCR will be a DVD video recorder. Launched last year in the UK by Philips and Panasonic, these archive TV programmes on DVDs that can store up to 4.7GB of video - enough for about two hours of excellent quality footage. In spite of industry fears, consumers don't appear to be too phased by the trio of incompatible DVD recording formats - DVD-RW (Pioneer, Sharp), DVD+RW (Philips) and DVD-RAM (Panasonic, JVC, Samsung), currently on sale. Another concern, that discs recorded on one machine would not play on other DVD machines, seems also not to be troubling buyers, perhaps because of the growth in write-once discs (DVD-R and DVD+R) which are compatible with most DVD players. Arguably the real issue that determines whether or not DVD recorders are successful is price. After starting at \u00a31,100, DVD recorders can now be picked up for \u00a3400, and that price is likely to fall further. \"When the price hits \u00a3300 the real growth will occur,\" predicts Philips spokesperson Andrew Burslem. \"You'd pay that for a DVD player and VHS recorder - with a DVD recorder you are getting them in the same box.\" Chances are that the video recorder of the future will look a lot like the HS2 launched earlier this month by Panasonic. \"Consumers are always going to want to have a hard copy of certain programmes,\" argues Panasonic's Robert Wojcik, \"so we have a hard disk recorder and DVD-RAM video recorder in the same box. Users get the flexibly of the HD system, with the option of archiving on to DVD.\" Although its price of \u00a31,000 limits its purchase to a few thousand wealthy early adopters and home entertainment die-hards, within two years these combis could be available from a variety of manufacturers (Philips and Toshiba have similar products in the pipeline) and priced at well under \u00a3500. Perhaps then those days of fuzzy pictures will seem like a distant memory. The end of the VCR DVD recorders Philips DVDR1000Mk2 \u00a31,000 Philips' high-end DVD recorder. Its key feature is Progressive Scan, which delivers superb quality images, though this only works with plasma screens and not conventional TVs. There are other image-tweaking systems for standard sets. It records on to rewritable DVD+RW and write-once DVD+R discs that are compatible with most DVD players. Philips DVDR880 \u00a3500 Popular DVD recorder due to its price (it is available on the web for around \u00a3400) and simplicity of use. Records on to rewritable DVD+RW and write-once DVD+R discs. Camcorder users should also note that it is available for \u00a3600 in the guise of the DVDR890 sporting a digital input and easy editing facilities. Panasonic DMR-E30 \u00a3550 Budget Panasonic recorder that stores video on rewritable DVD-RAM discs. As these are housed in a caddy they are incompatible with almost all DVD players. Users can however record to write-once DVD-R discs that will play back on most machines. A neat feature is the player's Time Slip facility that enables users to pause and rewind live TV. Hard disk recorders TiVo PVR10 \u00a3229 plus subscription (either \u00a3200 or \u00a310 a month) The original hard disk recorder. Stores up to 40 hours video on its 40GB hard disk. Also boasts innovative features such as its intelligent recording option that archives programmes it thinks you will like based on programmes you have previously recorded. Sky+ \u00a3250 plus \u00a310 a month subscription Sky's excellent hard disk recorder and digital TV decoder combi has just been upgraded. Users can now archive radio and rewind live TV as well as easily record programmes that are stored on its 40Gb hard disk. In early 2003, Sky promises to add a facility that will enable users to record two channels simultaneously. Panasonic DMR-HS2 \u00a31,000 Arguably the hottest home entertainment product of 2002, the HS2 combines a 40GB hard disk and DVD-RAM/DVD-R recorder. The user can timeshift using the hard disk and then archive programmes on to DVD. There's no sophisticated electronic programming system, so in order to make timed recordings users will have to re-acquaint themselves with the VideoPlus+ systems as used on VCRs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
