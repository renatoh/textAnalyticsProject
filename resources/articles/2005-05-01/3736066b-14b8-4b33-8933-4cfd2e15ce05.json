Kerry McLaughlin, who has been accused of aping the nightmare character Vicky Pollard from BBC TV's Little Britain, has also been ordered not to enter about two square miles of Wallsend, on Tyneside, in an attempt to reassure terrified neighbours. The order was imposed after the 19-year-old spent the weekend in police cells for allegedly flouting a milder Asbo which put her under a music-playing curfew and alcohol ban and barred more than two visitors from calling on her at a time. A judge acted after months of complaints about threats of violence, drunkenness and the tying of a naked teenager to a lamppost during a party at Ms McLaughlin's home. Ms McLaughlin, of Belsay Close in the Battle Hill area of Wallsend, left court hiding behind a magazine after agreeing to the draconian conditions. The hearing in North Shields was told that there had been 11 complaints about her behaviour by neighbours in the last 18 months. Handcuffed to a security guard, Ms McLaughlin was warned that jail would be her next home if she breached any part of the order. District judge Steven Alderson told her at the county court hearing: \"If there is a further breach you will almost certainly end up with a custodial sentence.\" Residents in Belsay Close have accused her of organising the stripping and tying up of the teenager, threatening neighbours with a hammer and throwing wheelie-bins at their houses. Other complaints detail swearing and shouting throughout all-night parties and an incident when Ms McLaughlin found glass in the street and promptly smashed her own windows to add to the mess. She was ordered to return to court in five weeks' time to face an eviction attempt by North Tyneside council, which says that she has run out of warnings to behave. She was also ordered not to cause a nuisance in Wallsend or attempt to intimidate neigh bours who may be called as witnesses in the eviction proceedings. The order is comparable to one served on a Merseyside family in March, banning two parents and their three sons from their home in New Brighton and the rest of the Wirral district council area. In practice that affected only one of the teenage boys as the rest of the family were in jail on remand or serving time. North Tyneside agreed to drop proceedings against Ms McLaughlin over her alleged breach of the earlier Asbo on Friday, on the grounds that her three nights in the cells had been \"punishment enough\". Her barrister, Antoine Tinnion, said: \"I have been through all of these matters with my client and she understands and agrees to abide by the injunction.\" One of her neighbours in Belsay Close said: \"She has brought misery to this street for nearly two years and we will all be glad to see the back of her. \"She is like the girl from Little Britain - she always wears her hair in a top-knot with a scrunchy and she even talks a bit like her. We've had enough.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
