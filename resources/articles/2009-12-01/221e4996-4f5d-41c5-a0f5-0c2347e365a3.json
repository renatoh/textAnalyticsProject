The 20-year-old midfielder, who signed a four-year contract in Glasgow, has been granted a work permit after a protracted \u00a32m transfer from FC Seoul. Ki is the young Asian player of the year and while Celtic have been keen to stress he has been signed for his football talent alone, is it thought the club will look to tap into fresh commercial markets on account of his arrival. \"We are very pleased to announce the signing of Ki and we are sure he is a player who has the potential to make an impact at Celtic,\" said the manager Tony Mowbray. \"We have watched the player in action already and believe that he has some real qualities. He is a young man, but someone who we believe has the ability and character to do well for the club.\" Ki, who speaks English having lived in Australia in his youth, will be eligible to play after 1 January. \"It is now a dream come true to join this great club \u2013 already Celtic has shown me a tremendous welcome and I really do now feel part of the Celtic family,\" said the player, who has 17 caps. \"I look forward to teaming up with my new manager and team-mates, and I will be working hard towards achieving all I can for Celtic.\" Ki joins a club who remain at the summit of the Scottish Premier League after Celtic came from behind to win 3-2 at Motherwell yesterday. Rangers comfortably swept St Johnstone aside, 3-0 at Ibrox, after which their goalkeeper Neil Alexander admitted he is considering his future. Alexander was handed a rare weekend start due to Allan McGregor's injury and believes he needs more first-team football. \"We have to wait to see what the future brings but there's only so long that I can continue like this before I need to get back playing,\" said the former Cardiff City player. \"If it's not here, then maybe I need to look somewhere else. It's my career at the end of the day and as much as I love it here and would love to stay for a long time, I feel I need to be playing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
