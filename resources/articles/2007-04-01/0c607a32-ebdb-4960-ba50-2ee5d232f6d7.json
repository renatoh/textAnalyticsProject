He was navigating through an industrial zone clogged with vehicles when a truck driver waved him through a gap. Ricardo hesitated for a moment then shot through. A Caracas courier is paid, after all, to beat the gridlock. What happened next Ricardo experienced first as if in fast forward, then in slow motion. From a street on the right, a taxi, an ancient Chrysler equally intent on saving time, sliced into his path. Ricardo slammed into the side of the car. Lifted from the saddle, he sailed over the taxi. As the asphalt neared, Ricardo stretched out his arms to cover his face. He landed with a crunch. The result was not pretty but could have been much, much worse. Ricardo, 55, bruised the left side of his body and suffered gashes to his arms and legs. His head, protected by a helmet, was unscathed, and no bones were broken. His company Vespa, it turned out, was also intact. The taxi driver mumbled an apology and drove off and Ricardo, shaken, continued his rounds. \"I remember standing up and feeling myself all over,\" he said, sipping a bottle of beer at his home in the slum of Petare a few days later. \"I was able to walk and move my limbs.\" Still stiff and sore, he limped around his house, his usual ebullient chatter subdued. \"These things happen,\" he shrugged. Few people in Petare have insurance. The tools of survival are instinct, luck and family. \"It was as if he was Superman,\" said Marisol, Ricardo's wife, also aged 55. \"Flying through the air like that.\" She said it teasingly, but there was no disguising her anxiety. For years she has dreaded the possibility that one day Ricardo will not return from work. In December their youngest daughter, Elinor, 31, was a passenger on a moped that crashed and almost cost her a leg. She rolled up her jeans to reveal a patchwork of vivid purple scars and 150 stitches. Had it stopped her riding on mopeds? She looked surprised at the question. \"No, of course not.\" She has little alternative. The metro line stops on the outskirts of Petare, and the ancient Jeeps that serve as buses don't reach their area. When Ricardo was 18 he had a much more serious moped accident, which ripped open his chest and head, scarring his forehead and leaving his left eye drooping, as if it were about to wink. In four years he hopes to retire. Till then it is a matter of taking care. He had improvised a bandage from a local flower, arnica. \"Works a treat,\" he says. And he did, it turned out, have a type of insurance: the Bible. A copy was lying opened on a speaker in the living room. Which chapter? \"No idea,\" shrugged Ricardo. \"The thing is to have it open. All Venezuelan families leave it open.\" Beside the book was a pile of CDs, the top one titled Erotic Salsa and illustrated with a bikini-clad woman. Ricardo was born and raised a Catholic and believes in God but does not go to mass or read the Bible. Sundays are for pottering around the house, spending time with the family and, often, recovering from a late night of beer and dominos with his friends. \"You don't know how long you have - no one does. So enjoy life while you can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
