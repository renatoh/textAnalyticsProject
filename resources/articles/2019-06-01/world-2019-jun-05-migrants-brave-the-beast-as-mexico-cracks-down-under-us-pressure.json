Migrants heading north are once again taking their chances on the freight train known as La Bestia \u2013 so named for the way it maims unlucky riders who fall beneath its wheels as it grinds across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Not so long ago, migrants were increasingly seeking safety in numbers, joining mass caravans to travel through Mexico. For a while they encountered an unusually warm welcome, but in recent weeks, the reception has cooled dramatically: police roadblocks have sprung up across the south of the country, and immigration officials have raided migrant camps and broken up caravans. Evelio Isidro, 23, left Honduras on foot to escape extortionists, and originally planned to walk the length of Mexico after hearing that the government was offering transit visas for Central Americans. But when the group he was travelling with was targeted by immigration officials \u2013 forcing him to run through the hills to escape arrest \u2013 he opted instead for the risky train journey. \u201cPresident [Andr\u00e9s] Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said they weren\u2019t going to detain any migrants so I decided to come,\u201d Isidro said. \u201cBut police and immigration officials are detaining and deporting us.\u201d When he took power in January, L\u00f3pez Obrador promised to overhaul immigration policy in Mexico \u2013 long feared by Central American migrants as a danger zone of extortion, kidnap and sexual assaults. The president, known as Amlo, said that Mexico would no longer do America\u2019s \u201cdirty work\u201d, instead offering humanitarian visas allowing migrants to spend one year in the country. But Donald Trump has derailed those aspirations. The US president has repeatedly accused Mexico of failing to stop migrants and illegal drugs from reaching the US, and is now threatening to slap tariffs on Mexican exports until the issue is resolved. During his visit to London on Tuesday, Trump reprised the theme, claiming that \u201cmillions of people\u201d were being allowed to pass through Mexico, and warning that tariffs could be imposed as soon as next week. Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry retorted by boasting robust detention and deportation figures: 80,537 people have been repatriated, mostly to Central America, since Amlo took office. L\u00f3pez Obrador also wrote to Trump, reminding his US counterpart, \u201cThe Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol.\u201d But Amlo has acceded to Trump\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, forcing nearly 9,000 asylum seekers to stay in Mexico as their cases are heard in US courts. Meanwhile, Mexican immigration officials are taking longer to issue travel documents and caravans are quickly corralled. \u201cThe government is reacting in an extremely hostile way and with [migration] policies which are far from its rhetoric,\u201d said Salva Lacruz, coordinator with the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova Human Rights Centre in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. Mexico has started issuing \u201cregional visas\u201d which allow migrants to freely visit several southern states \u2013 far from the US border. But migrants have shown little interest in the poverty-ridden region where wages are little higher than in Central America. \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic to contain Trump\u2019s anger,\u201d Lacruz said of the regional visas. \u201cThe Mexican government is under enormous pressure from the United States.\u201d Even amid the crackdown, migrants keep coming: on Tuesday about 400 people crossed the Suchiate River from Guatemala. Tensions have boiled over in the nearby city of Tapachula, where migrants have staged mass outbreaks from the XXI Century detention centre. Tuesday\u2019s group was mostly composed of Hondurans, but others passing through the city hail from Cuba, Haiti and African countries. Many camp out in Tapachula as they wait, living in cockroach-infested flop hotels or sleeping on sheets of cardboard along roadsides. \u201cMy kids have a cold and a cough,\u201d said Kesner Bazin, a Haitian migrant who on a recent afternoon was waiting in the rain outside the migrant center for a transit visa which would give him 20 days to cross Mexico. He was hoping to reach Tijuana with his family after eight years living in Brazil, but had no idea when the document would be granted. \u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d he shrugged. When the first large-scale caravans passed through the region in late 2018, residents welcomed migrants with open arms, offering weary travellers water, food and clothing. That help has evaporated and some locals have turned hostile. A group of nuns was handing out food to migrants in Tapachula\u2019s central square, when a passing motorist screamed: \u201cDon\u2019t feed them! Put those lazy fucks to work!\u201d The nuns feed about 2,500 migrants once a day \u2013 rice, beans, eggs and bread \u2013 though donations are scarce and local traders often try to gouge prices, said Sister Bertha L\u00f3pez, the mother superior. \u201cThere\u2019s a climate of apathy when it comes to helping,\u201d she said. Officials have turned hostile, too. In Huixtla, up the road from Tapachula, patrol cars have circulated through town, warning over a loudspeaker: \u201cA dangerous caravan is coming.\u201d \u201cI have to defend my people,\u201d said Huixtla\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Laparra, banging his fist on the table before boasting that his police force was \u201cbusting the heads\u201d of bad people. Unsubstantiated stories of migrants committing crimes circulate on social media and create scandalous headlines. \u201cThe state [government] and prosecutor\u2019s office doesn\u2019t have any statistics showing crime has increased,\u201d said Sandybell Reyes, migration coordinator with Voces Mesoamericanas, a human rights organisation. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigmatisation of the caravans and all the people coming with them.\u201d Migration experts say caravans formed so migrants could move openly and avoid the risks of the road through Mexico. Now they warn that, as in previous crackdowns, migrants will be forced to take longer, more risky routes \u2013 such as the Beast - to avoid immigration checkpoints. \u201cThey\u2019re more exposed to being robbed, being raped, attacks by organised crime,\u201d said Guadalupe Ram\u00edrez, a volunteer at the Brothers on the Road shelter in Ixtepec. \u201cThey\u2019re like the perfect target.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
