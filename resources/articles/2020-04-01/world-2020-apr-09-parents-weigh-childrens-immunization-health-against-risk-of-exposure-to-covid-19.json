Meanwhile, providers are figuring out whether they can safely treat all their young patients in-person, and if not, which children take priority. Lauren Begen\u2019s son was supposed to go for his six-month vaccines in mid-April. But, as Boston barrels toward the apex of its Covid-19 outbreak, their family is staying at home as much as possible to avoid exposure to the virus. They\u2019re making decisions they never thought possible, including delaying their baby\u2019s booster vaccinations after speaking with their doctor. \u201cI don\u2019t love it, but I think honestly it was kind of obvious,\u201d Begen said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve put a lot of practices in place to protect themselves and patients, but the reality is you can only do so much.\u201d The risk of prevention It\u2019s a series of calculations that will, at best, cause short-term delays in some children\u2019s immunizations and at worst could lead to outbreaks or even a potential epidemic, experts say. The extent of the problem depends on how long vaccinations get pushed back and whether children who have missed a dose or two can get on their doctors\u2019 calendars before returning to school or daycare. Doctors in the US are supposed to administer doses of the same vaccine every few months to the infants in their care. Such inoculations ward off serious conditions such as rotavirus, pertussis (AKA whooping cough), tetanus and polio, according to the recommended child and adolescent immunization schedule for 2020. \u201cCould we see an outbreak, let\u2019s say, six months from now? Yeah, I think we can,\u201d said Leila M Iravani, a pediatrician at Total Pediatrics of Orange County in Costa Mesa, California. \u201cI think so. We\u2019ll see sicker kids because they were not immunized.\u201d Iravani usually examines between 15 and 18 children every day for checkups. But during the coronavirus pandemic, that number has more than halved due to cancellations and no-shows. She estimated that up to 60% of those missed appointments are for vaccines, and probably 50% of those are younger than two. \u201cWe can do telemedicine for the development, but those vaccines are gonna be the thing that\u2019s gonna protect them,\u201d Iravani said. Her practice is trying to chase down its patients who are most at risk if they don\u2019t get their vaccinations on time. Parents of two-month-olds are still largely coming to their checkups, she said; older babies, less so. Sometimes, parents claim they forgot their appointment and reschedule, only to flake a second time. It\u2019s an unprecedented turn of events for Iravani, who has been practicing medicine for 17 years. \u201cThis just speaks to the worry that a lot of parents have. They just don\u2019t want to risk coming out,\u201d she said. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, the US has been dealing with isolated outbreaks of preventable diseases as states saw a decline in the number of vaccinated young children due to misinformation and fear of inoculations. In April 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the greatest number of measles cases in the country since 2000, when the ailment was eliminated domestically. Youngest get top priority Other healthcare providers the Guardian contacted said they haven\u2019t experienced the same dramatic dip in visits as Iravani has seen. But they in turn have had to change whom they allow into their offices \u2013 and, as an extension, which children get their vaccinations as expected. In the face of Covid-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has said that \u201cimmunizing the youngest children is top priority\u201d. So, at Cook Children\u2019s Pediatrics Trophy Club in Texas, checkups for healthy kids who are older than 18 months have been temporarily postponed. Justin Smith, the pediatrician there, said he\u2019s asking families to call back in May for an update or to reschedule. Likewise, Mary\u2019s Center, a community health center with locations in Washington DC and Maryland, has decided to cut off immunizations right now at 15 months, knowing they\u2019ll have to do a big push this summer to bring kids in who missed their vaccines. \u201cA lot of our patients have to take three or four buses\u201d to reach the medical centers, said Jessica Schroeder, director of pediatrics for the group. \u201cThere\u2019d be a lot of exposure to try to get to the clinic.\u201d Last week, Vaccines for Children \u2013 a federally funded program that gives free immunizations to families who can\u2019t afford them \u2013 reached out to the nurse manager at Mary\u2019s Center about the drop in their orders and use of vaccines, Schroeder said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put kids at risk for getting sick, yet you don\u2019t want a pertussis outbreak either.\u201d In New York, Tova Bourque got a call from her eight-month-old son\u2019s doctor cancelling his hepatitis B vaccine for later this month. She was frustrated with the situation of the pandemic, but understood her doctor\u2019s actions. \u201cI like things on schedule, so I\u2019m kind of not happy about it,\u201d Bourque said. \u201cBut at the same time, like, I don\u2019t want to go to some germ fest.\u201d Pediatricians are being careful, limiting the number of people attending visits, taking everyone\u2019s temperature before letting them inside, funneling patients straight to exam rooms and asking providers to wear masks. Some offices are having virtual sick visits or moving sick care to the afternoons only. But not all people who are Covid-19 positive show symptoms, and some screening methods \u2013 such as asking whether other family members are sick \u2013 rely on the honor system. At the same time, pediatricians are fielding different risks depending on how many coronavirus cases are confirmed in their area and whether they have the luxury of converting one of their offices to care exclusively for sick patients, said Kate Williamson, a pediatrician in Ladera Ranch, California, and spokeswoman for AAP. \u201cCall your [healthcare] provider,\u201d advised William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor at Vanderbilt University school of medicine. \u201cHave a discussion with people in the office. Listen carefully to their instructions about what it is to do, and how we can do this with maximum safety.\u201d O\u2019Hagan Blades, a new mom to Arthur, said she felt better after learning his doctor\u2019s practice wasn\u2019t seeing sick kids in the office any more. Neither she nor Arthur has ventured beyond their home in Brooklyn, New York, since the first week of March, a stark contrast to her fantasies of picnics in the park with her newborn. But on Thursday, Blades will don a mask, cover Arthur in his stroller and walk 40 minutes to his pediatrician\u2019s office. \u201cI have concerns about leaving the house with him obviously, but I think that getting the vaccines are more important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be stupid to get a preventable disease because we\u2019re trying to avoid Covid.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
