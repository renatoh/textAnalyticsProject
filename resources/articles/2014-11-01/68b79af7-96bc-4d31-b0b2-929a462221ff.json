He was at it again against Liverpool. SCAPEGOAT OF THE DAY Mario Balotelli \u2013 managed one touch inside Newcastle\u2019s box, and took his run without a league goal to 689 minutes. Team-mates not giving him the ball may be a factor. BEST AWKWARD FACTS \u00a330m Cesc F\u00e0bregas now has as many assists this season as \u00a342m Mesut \u00d6zil managed in the whole of last season; and Cristiano Ronaldo has found the net 20 times since Aston Villa last scored. WINTER WEAR While London sweltered in 18C November sunshine, QPR\u2019s Armand Traor\u00e9 decided he just couldn\u2019t do without gloves. MOST PUT-OUT Joey Barton played for QPR\u2019s Under-21s in the morning as he recovers from injury, and planned to spend his afternoon watching the seniors at Chelsea. He couldn\u2019t get a ticket and went to Brentford v Derby instead. MOST COSMOPOLITAN Eddy Pascual, who played for Granada against Real Madrid having come through at Milan, has a dad from Angola and a mother from Azerbaijan. He was born in Spain. BEST HALLOWEEN MOMENT Nick Cotton\u2019s EastEnders comeback trumped by the lights going out on Jeff Stelling. Cue grown pundits making ghost noises. COMEBACK OF THE DAY Three goals in 20 minutes had Elgin feeling smug in their Scottish Cup game against Bo\u2019ness United. Bo\u2019ness then hit three in eight minutes to draw level. It ended 4-4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
