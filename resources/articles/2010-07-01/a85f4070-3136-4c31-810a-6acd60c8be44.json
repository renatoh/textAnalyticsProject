The depth of their financial obligations raises the question whether they could raise the money to secure the Arsenal captain Cesc F\u00e1bregas. Digger has received financial analysis prepared by Professor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gay, the head of the University of Barcelona's economics and business unit and Spain's foremost authority on football finance. In the document Gay presents Barcelona's troubled 2009-10 balance sheet, which he describes as \"very worrying\". Wage costs have risen 55% from their 2008 level to \u20ac262m (\u00a3220m). By contrast the club's stated revenues have risen 33% over the same period, meaning wages now account for almost 64% of income. Barcelona have evidently been a victim of their own success, with the treble of Champions League, Primera Liga and Copa Del Rey wins bringing with them onerous bonus commitments. Gay points out that the club's short-term debt of \u20ac392m (\u00a3329m) far exceeds their working capital of \u20ac110m (\u00a392m) and even hints there could be a risk of default during the current close season. Barcelona have recently approached the market for another \u20ac150m (\u00a3126m) of borrowings, though it is unknown if contracts have been agreed. The Camp Nou president, Sandro Rosell, insists his club is \"not bankrupt\". Even so, Arsenal are not disposed to sell them F\u00e1bregas. Wembley shuffle goes on Julian Eccles's arrival at Wembley as the Football Association's director of communications, public affairs and marketing has coincided with the head of the marketing department quitting the organisation. Simon Freedman is to leave next month after three years at the FA. He is moving sideways as head of sponsorship at O2. This might suggest restlessness at Eccles's arrival but Freedman has said he always intended to return to his blue\u2011chip background and that his new role is \"more commercial\". Freedman is the second senior marketing or commercial man to quit the FA following the exit of the commercial director, Jonathan Hill, last year. But though Freedman is highly regarded the new chief executive, Alex Horne may welcome the latest departure as he deals with an unwieldy payroll inherited from Brian Barwick and Ian Watmore. Leggett takes a step up The FA has also lost decades of non\u2011executive experience after Dave Henson bowed out of its boardroom. Henson, an amateur game representative through the Devon FA, has been a vice-president of the FA since 1986 but has lost his position as a director after turning 70. He is to be replaced by Mervyn Leggett, the long-serving 61-year-old FA councillor. It is a big step up for Leggett, but his status as a permanent employee in the game \u2013 his position as the secretary of the Worcestershire FA is a full-time role \u2013 gives him a good insight into the challenges the FA faces. Questionable valuation Football clubs \"don't get wound up\", Ron Martin assured Southend United fans in an interview published on his club's website in April. But then he remembered that, of course, yes, some do. \"I know Chester City did, but they probably didn't have any assets,\" he said. So what is the difference between Chester and Southend? Well, not much, according to a letter from Martin himself to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The chairman was writing in response to the taxman's preparations to apply for a court order for Southend's administration over a \u00a3238,710 debt (their third set of insolvency proceedings in 12 months). \"If the club goes into liquidation HMRC will get nothing, because its only value is as a football club.\" With the freehold to the Roots Hall ground not in Southend's hands but those of an arms-length company, with only 10 first\u2011team players on the books and the club labouring under a transfer embargo, even that \"value as a football club\" is currently questionable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
