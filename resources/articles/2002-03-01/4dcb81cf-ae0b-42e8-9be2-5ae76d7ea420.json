And when the food is typical award ceremony-standard rubber chicken and the after dinner booze is for gold card holders only, the importance of the seating arrangements becomes heightened. But at the annual carnage that passes for the Britain's most prestigious press awards, eyebrows were raised at the sight of two of Fleet Street's most fearsome editors sitting on the Siberian side of the London Hilton's ballroom. In fact, Veronica Wadley, the newish editor of the Evening Standard, was seated so far from the action she was in the bar. But The News of the World editor, Rebekah Wade, didn't even make it. She splashed out thousands for the table but, at the last minute, ordered all her hacks - including columnist Rav \"I can exclusively reveal\" Singh and the paper's undercover chief Mazher Mahmood - to boycott the event, leaving tables 39 and 41 empty except for a fake sheikh, who had been hired to pick up the award. Wade, furious that her paper had not won anything, took her team up the road to the Grosvenor House - presumably to look for some moral high ground. To the uninitiated, the press awards are quite an eye-opener. Not so much a back-slapping affair but, as Monkey's colleague Marina Hyde put it, \"a carnival of hate\". And as the night wore on, the atmosphere became lairier. Wade wasn't the only one furious with the tabloids' lot. Piers \"I'm serious\" Morgan, who found himself in what he described as \"winner's territory\" - nestled between two broadsheet tables - was banging on the table muttering obscenities as one broadsheet after another picked up awards. \"It's a fucking joke, it's a fucking joke,\" he ranted. Of course, once the Mirror was named newspaper of the year, the event turned into the most respected and prestigious night of the calendar, accurately reflecting all that is great in the broad church that is the British press. But the build-up to the paper's victory was all too much for one Mirror hack. As the paper's editor leaped to the stage to pick up the winner's glass scroll, Matt Kelly decided it was time to make a point about the Sun. Standing on the chair he mistook for a football terrace, he punched the air, victoriously chanting \"You fucking cunts, you fucking cunts!\" in the direction of his rivals. Charming. Kelly wasn't the only one to be so candid about the Sun. Earlier in the bar Morgan was overheard in conversation with Independent editor Simon \"empty handed\" Kelner. \"I really hope the Observer wins newspaper of the year,\" said Morgan. \"So I can replace one bald hate figure with another.\" Back on table 81 (that's the one jutting into the bar), Wadley was also laying on the charm with a trowel. Looking refreshed after her Cuban holiday, she spent most of the night smooth-talking news editor Ian Walker, who is still recovering from a bad skiing accident. What could it all mean? What could it all mean, part 2: It was lovely to see the new Times editor, Robert Thomson, wearing something different from the tweed jacket in which he is ubiquitously pictured. And lovely to see him clutching his deputy editor, Ben Preston, by the hand as they made a fashionably late entrance to the ballroom. If the guest list on table 81 was a statement of who is in and who is out in the new Standard regime, then let Monkey be the first to share the news. Also on Queen Vee's table was new sports editor Simon Greenberg, deputy editor Andy Bordiss, news features boss Phil \"highlighter\" Evans, veteran picture editor David Ofield, features editor Nicola Jeal and Janice Morley, the veteran editor of the Homes and Property supplement. And of course, photographer of the year Cavan Pawson. Speaking of who's in and who's out, Rebecca Hardy, the former editor of the Scotsman, is back in London and about to take up a post in Rothermere Towers. So much for Dacre's legendary tendancy to freeze disloyal servants out of his paper. Hardy, who quit the Daily Mail for the doomed editorship north of the border, will be back in some sort of writing capacity, it seems. Their long careers in showbusiness stood John Bird and John Fortune in good stead last night as they managed to raise just a few chuckles from the pack of braying jackals that brought new meaning to the phrase \"tough crowd\". Compared with the slaughter of Tony Hawks three years ago, the audience practically gave the duo a standing ovation. Monkey was delighted to see columnist Carol Sarler seated on the Camelot table following her piece in this week's Media Guardian, in which she poignantly revealed how difficult and expensive it was for freelances to attend the awards bash. The lottery organiser came to Sarler's rescue, phoning to offer her a free place because \"there was no one more deserving\". It just goes to show - it could be you. The stunned silence that greeted the announcement that the Mirror was newspaper of the year was not a reflection on the paper's achievement but bemusement that the award was presented by two \u00a315m lottery winners from Birmingham who, like the fake sheikh left to dine alone with the secretaries on the News of the World's table, could not work out why they were there. All in all, it was a relatively well-behaved event - no blood, no smashed glasses, no diced carrots in the corridors. Could this have anything to do with the fact it was all being captured on camera for a BBC documentary? 2pm update: Neighbours of the Sun have just emailed in with tales from the Wapping side of the Hilton ballroom. Editor David Yelland, columnist Richard Littlejohn and political editor Trevor Kavanagh were apparently a picture as award after award went to rivals at last night's British Carnage Awards. \"Their faces got stonier and stonier as the evening went on and the Mirror did better and better. Kavanagh turned his back to the presenters after failing to pick up his prize. But Yelland did clap - apparently genuinely - when Morgan went up to get his gong. He looked quite magnanimous as the rest of his table hissed.\" And over at the table masquerading as a News of the World party sat the fake Sheikh. \"He was clearly very bored. He spent the whole evening texting his mates,\" said one bemused hack. At the Mirror's after show party in the nearby Met bar, Morgan was larging it big time. His deputy Des Kelly was seen grappling with one of the bar staff over some dispute. While comedian Johnny Vegas was in the corner celebrating after picking up his RTS award.... And it was nice to see Kelvin MacKenzie lording it on the Harrods table. Perhaps Al Fayed is still interested in buying a paper or even another radio station? 3.30pm update: Des Kelly, deputy editor of the Mirror, was indeed seen \"grappling\" with someone in the Met bar. But apparently our man on the Monkey tree only got it half right. He did indeed do battle with another chap but it was a rival award-winner. And Kelly admits it was all his mistake. \"I was wandering around the bar with one of the UKPG trophies thinking it was the Mirror's... unfortunately, it wasn't. For reasons that are all too obvious I was unable to focus on the fine print of the inscription. A poor chap quite rightly took exception to me brandishing his glass prize and set about tugging it away from me in a bit of an agitated state. Still, no harm done. And I never found out who the owner was. Please pass on my apologies, though, if you can.\" Apologies to whoever deserves them then. 5.45 update: As the hangovers start to fade, it seems that eye-witnesses are beginning to recall with greater clarity the details of Mirror deputy editor Des Kelly's stand-off with a rival award winner in the Met Bar. One observer remembers things slightly differently from Kelly's version of events (see above). In fact, he distinctly remembers Kelly threatening his assailant with the cry: \"I'm going to bite your fucking nose off\". Perhaps he was trying to emulate the infamous antics of Vinnie Jones, who once bit a journalist's nose during an altercation in a Dublin bar. Not only that, but Kelly knew full well that the award didn't belong to him, says our informer, and was just trying it on - even trying to make off in a taxi with the thing after handing it back once. Monkey demands to know the truth - if you were Kelly's grappling partner, get in touch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
