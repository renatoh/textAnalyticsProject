Beverley Hughes: Well, we'll have to see the conclusions of the [European] council meeting. But we're hopeful that the language will be broadly sympathetic. The UNHCR and the commission have both said that they are very interested in pursuing that particular idea. I think if that's the case coming out of the council today then we will be able to progress with countries that we are working with to have a pilot scheme up and running around about the end of this year. TH: Where might they be located? BH: The UNHCR have got a number of ideas, because of course this is consistent with one of their strands of work and thinking. You could envisage a centre somewhere in Africa, perhaps related to the situation in Somalia - that's one possibility, maybe the most likely one. But we'd have to see a bit nearer the time what the options were and evaluate those. But the idea would be that the centre itself would be close to somewhere which at the moment is a country where there are significant numbers of people feeling that they have to flee persecution one way or the other. And by being closer to them, it would make that easier for them and prevent traffickers and so on being able to sell their service to people in the way that they do at the moment. TH: Would it involve a military commitment? BH: I think the question of military input would be made initially on quite a different basis, and we're not anticipating that the place that would be chosen for the first pilot would involve that kind of intervention. I think that decision would be made outside of the decision for the regional protection centres, because it's clearly a much bigger decision, involving the UN. TH: The foreign secretary talked about the EU constitution this week, and said he'd like to see more cooperation on asylum between EU countries. Where would you like to see more cooperation? BH: There's potential for cooperation around the work that's going on at the moment on harmonisation. What we want to see is that process translated into actual outcomes. At the moment those processes are going on and there's not a minimum standard. What we want to see is those methods being used, particularly to improve the global situation so they do actually result in an improved outcome, so that issues like asylum are addressed, rather than simply establishing a minimum standard, whatever that might achieve or might need. I think there's also potential for us to work together much more effectively on the whole issue of returning people, in this instance from our own individual countries. That's a big issue for the European countries. We have a lot of problems with countries outside the EU accepting the available documentation at the moment, for instance in relation to people we think are their nationals. The home secretary proposed the establishment of a returners' fund, which I think has broadly been accepted. But we need to do much more work diplomatically, talking to some of these countries together, as EU partners, instead of each of us trying to develop readmission agreements and bilateral arrangements in terms of returns of people. That is a particularly important area. TH: Would you be interested in seeing greater EU cooperation on white-listed countries? BH: I think you'd have to think about how the practicalities of that would work. Obviously all of those issues depend on passing legislation for each individual country, as we've had to do here, so you'd have to make sure you can work legally, within the parameters of your own domestic legislation. But a number of countries have already got lists of countries that they regard as safe in the same way that we have. But unless you've got some practical method of common processing - and we're not talking about that at the moment except insofar as regional protection centres - then it'd be difficult to proceed along that route on a practical level. Certainly in terms of what we've been doing in terms of reforming our own domestic system, that's a road we've gone down, along with other European countries. TH: What about holding a white list in common? BH: To be honest I can't immediately see what the advantages of that would be. There's some commonality already in relation to the countries identified by the EU countries. The big issue, even with some of the safe countries, is the issue I've just alluded to, that of re-documenting people to the satisfaction of the country you're trying to return people to, and getting them returned when their asylum claims have failed. In a sense we've got a non-suspensive element to the process for people who make claims from safe countries here, and there's no point having that unless you can return people. That's one of the issues we need to address and other countries need to address. You can have as fast a process as you like - you can deal with particular groups of people - like those from safe countries - in a certain way, like taking away the in-country right of appeal, but unless you can actually get the country you want to return them to to accept them then you've got a problem. TH: Are you expecting progress on that at the summit? BH: In principle, yes, because David's put forward this proposal for a returns fund, that is some fund to progress this work, and I think countries are aware that we're each trying to negotiate these things individually and it makes much more sense for us to act corporately vis-a-vis the individual countries. To say, look, can we agree collectively what kind of documentation you accept, can we agree some timescales within which you'll make decisions on individuals that we put to you? And it makes much more sense if we're doing that together rather than each of us having to come to those agreements separately. There's huge potential there, and it is very important. TH: The last published figures were hopeful. Are they still going where you want? BH: They are still going in the direction we want. There's still an issue, I mean we won't be able to say we've been able to consolidate that until the November figures are produced. The figures for the third quarter will be published in November so we'll have the second quarter's published in August for April-May-June, and then July-August-September will be published in November. And so we won't really know fundamentally whether we've been able to consolidate and maintain or even improve on that, but at the moment we're continuing with the progress we made in the first quarter. TH: Is extending the white list going to help with that? BH: It's part of a whole panoply of measures. That's been quite important, certainly in terms of the first group of countries, the accession countries. We've seen the number of claims from those countries drop substantially. It's also the measures that we've taken in Calais, moving towards full joint reciprocal controls with France. Working also with Belgium, the Netherlands, we're going to be putting in detection equipment in key ports in those countries - because once you actually block off one entry route, through Calais, you get displacement if you're not careful. A lot of this activity is fuelled by criminal gangs, trafficking people, and they want to sell a service for profit, so if they can't get anyone in one way they'll try and get in another way. TH: What about entitlement cards? BH: The home secretary is quite keen that the government proceeds down this route, and that's because there's only so much you can do towards certain kinds of issues - like illegal working, to some extent illegal immigration itself - towards knowing who's going in and out of the country at any one time. The decision has got to be made by cabinet, which will be when we've actually published the results of the consultation, which we're still considering. Cabinet will make a decision, and that will probably be by the end of the summer. But we've yet to publish our consultation results, and we hope to do that as soon as possible. TH: Is there a concern about public health dangers if people who are here in the country illegally are deterred from seeking medical help? BH: I don't think there's so much of a concern that people who are here illegally seeking medical help, I think the concern if anything is in the other direction. There is concern about the question of entitlement to have services of people in the country. When I did several meetings, as I did during the consultation on ID cards, I did several public meetings around the country and it was very interesting that people who were chairs of health authorities and so on were actually raising this issue with me. Would an entitlement card enable us to establish eligibility, for instance, for health services? I think there's concerns about that. And clearly there's also some concerns about what are the issues. I wouldn't put it any more strongly than this at the moment. Before Christmas, the home secretary and the secretary of state for health commissioned some work to be done between those two departments and the Foreign Office to scope that whole question. And that's going on now - the Cabinet Office are leading that interdepartmental review and producing some work for us to consider. TH: It sounds like you do think there's a case for health screening of people entering the country. BH: That certainly is one of the questions that the Cabinet Office review will be asking and putting to ministers the arguments for and the arguments against that and trying to evaluate whether that would be on balance an important thing for us to consider. TH: Is this something you personally feel comfortable with? BH: I certainly think we've got to consider it and, in fact, in relation to people seeking asylum we've decided that we will include health screening and we're in the process of establishing a new system that was also identified in the bill. And part of that is to have a proper induction for people when they claim asylum so they are actually taken to a place and a whole system is explained to them. And they are issued now with, basically, an ID card of their own, called an application registration card, with their fingerprints on. As part of that process we've been piloting health screening at the single induction centre that exists at the moment in Dover. That was actually quite interesting, certainly with that group of people, because although the pilot took place for about six months and was then evaluated, when the results came in there was no actual serious illnesses detected among the people who claimed asylum in that period. No TB, no Aids/HIV, just minor things - scabies, for instance, very minor infections that you'd expect any of us to have. But nothing serious or anything of the degree that you might expect. We've got very limited date on this issue at the moment, but I certainly think health screening is something we're going to have to bite that bullet and consider. TH: Would that be wider than asylum? You read a lot in the papers now about people coming from sub-Sahara Africa seeking treatment for HIV. Is that a bullet that has got to be bitten, beyond the issue of asylum? BH: I think we've got to ask the question. But clearly were one to even entertain the possibility of screening for every visitor, we're talking about 90 million people coming into the country, clearly that's not an option. But we may need to strike a balance. And it's those questions, and what data we can draw on, that help us look at the arguments for and against and the feasibility of the issue you're raising. On asylum of course it does raise some difficult questions but, as hard as it is, the fact that you can't actually get treatment, or there isn't enough treatment for a serious illness in a particular country isn't of itself a reason that justifies asylum. TH: Bangladesh was added to the white list recently. This country still commits human rights abuses, torture, and so forth. Why extend the white list to countries whose human rights record is still in question? BH: The test that has to be met in our legislation is whether a country is generally safe for the generality of the population. That doesn't mean there aren't certain parts of the country or certain groups where there are some risks of persecution. What the safe country list does isn't say that people's claims won't be assessed. Everybody's claim is assessed in exactly the same way, there's no difference, and some claims will be granted. What it means, though, is that if a claim is refused at that initial stage, if somebody's found not to meet the threshold of the convention, that they then won't have an in-country right of appeal. Now, we've put great efforts into the process, obviously, to make sure that the quality of initial decision-making is as high as we can make it and those decisions are overseen. We realise that people who get turned down have to appeal from outside the country, having been sent back. Quality is an important issue to me anyway, it's very, very important, so there should be a second pair of eyes to look at all those decisions. And some people will be granted asylum because they'll be able to establish a case, but I go back to the first point, that the fact that there may be some issues for some groups or some parts of a country doesn't mean that that country isn't generally safe. I mean, Bangladesh is a democracy, it has ratified all six elements of the UN human rights conventions, and it isn't actually unsafe for most people. However, I accept that there may be some for whom it is, and if they get to the UK their claims will still be assessed and they will still receive asylum if they can establish who they are and that their case and experience meets the criteria for refugee status. TH: Tell me about your broadest objectives. BH: This is important to me, and the government, because what people often pick up on, for understandable reasons, is what we're having to do on asylum - and I say having to do, I think for very important political reasons. But people connect with what they see happening in some of our communities. Establishing public confidence in the asylum system is very closely related with the importance of establishing good community relations in this country and ensuring that people who come here from other countries do get the kind of welcome and acceptance that we would want them to have. So it's very important that we return asylum to the purpose for which it's been intended, even though that does mean policies that people regard as quite tough. But alongside that, something which we get much less opportunity to talk about is what we're doing on managed migration, and what we're doing in terms of migration generally. I think that's very radical because what we're actually saying is that we want people to come here, that we need them to come here for our economy. Large parts of the health sector, of the public service, and elsewhere have people from foreign countries working in them, and we want that and we need it. But it has to be people coming in to make that contribution, to bring that experience, and through open and transparent and legal routes. We've opened up a whole variety of routes, not only extending the work-permit route opening opportunities for highly skilled people to come in, but also piloting some routes that I announced in November for low-skilled people to come and work in those sectors to come here and have the opportunity of working. That's very much part of what we want to say as a government, which is that our immigration policies are not about \"Fortress Britain\". It's about opening up opportunities for people, and through that our relationships with other countries. It's very positive for people to come here and hopefully become ambassadors for Britain as a result of that experience. The third strand is doing much better, by refugees in particular, but also other people that come here either temporarily or permanently, to integrate those people. That also is very important from an interrelations point of view. TH: Britain is historically seen as a stable, democratic haven. Is that something to be proud of? BH: I really do think it's something to be proud of, and I do agree that in part whether large numbers of the people who come here claiming asylum are refugees or not, it's nonetheless a very positive commentary on how Britain is perceived in the world that they are trying to get here. We do have to sort that out, but we have to keep in mind that people are coming for positive reasons. The fact that we've got a language that's universal, pretty much, is also important, and I think that the third reason is that we are already - and are proud of the fact that we are - a multi-cultural community. I think people feel they will get more acceptance here than perhaps elsewhere, that there are already established communities that connect with the nationalities of the people wanting to come in, so they feel that they already have communities here that they can latch on to. These are very positive reasons, but that doesn't mean that, just because their reasons are positive, simply allow people to use the asylum system. We do have to get the system sorted out and that's why we've gone to some great lengths to agree relations with the French, work closely with them and put through legislation. The public confidence in that system is crucially important. TH: Do you think the need for economic migrants will diminish as the EU expands and accepts poorer countries as members? BH: That certainly should in the short term have an impact. We've made the decision through parliament not to have transitional restrictions on people from the accession countries. They will be able to come, if they have a job to come to, to live here and work, from the date of accession. There are a number of sectors in our economy at the moment that feel that will be of great benefit to them. We do have to make sure in developing these measures that we remain aware that we haven't solved all the problems in relation to our resident population. While we've massively increased employment, there's still a hard-to-reach group, and I wouldn't want to imply that we've given up on that group. The new deal is going to be developed to make sure that we can bring that group into work as well, but the ability of accession country people to come in, in the short term, will be very welcome by certain sectors in our economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
