The club remain in position to qualify for the Champions League, as they sit fourth in the table with five matches to go. \"If we don't end up fourth this year, we will have failed as a squad,\" Parker said. Straight-talking was the order of the day and no punches were pulled in the inquest, even if, not for the first time in recent weeks, Tottenham could lament a cruel hand from the Fates. They were the better team in the first half only to trail to Didier Drogba's 43rd-minute bolt from the blue while for Chelsea's second replays showed that Juan Mata's shot had not crossed the line. Tottenham regained a foothold when Gareth Bale scored to make it 2-1 but Parker, together with his team-mates William Gallas and Carlo Cudicini, preferred to highlight how open they became, which allowed Chelsea to play through them. \"We were not compact and they had a lot of space to play,\" Gallas said. \"Maybe it was a big mistake from us. I would not say that we were robbed.\" \"We started to be quite open,\" Cudicini said, \"and that gave Chelsea a lot of chances in the end and that made the score the way it was. I think it was a really bad decision [to allow Mata's goal] but then we ended up losing 5-1 so it's difficult to complain against the referee.\" It was the third time this season that Tottenham had conceded five goals in a game and it led to renewed questions about their organisation and mental toughness. \"This result shows we are not ready yet,\" Gallas said. \"We have to improve a lot, even if we have good players and a good squad. We have to work more and more.\" Tottenham have slumped since early February, when Harry Redknapp was popularly acclaimed as the England manager-in-waiting and his club sat comfortably in third, to be fancied as an outside title bet. Since the 5-0 defeat of Newcastle United on 11 February, they have won only once in eight league matches; Arsenal have overtaken them, Newcastle United and Chelsea have reeled them in. The Cup exit has hardened the feeling that their luck is out and their season is falling apart. \"We can't keep looking back, we can't keep feeling sorry for ourselves,\" Parker said. \"We need to look forward now. That's exactly what we said in the dressing room [after the Chelsea defeat]. We were very disappointed. We lost our shape at times searching for a goal. But we've got five games left and we need to dust ourselves off, and try and win them. We have to stay positive and try and grind out the rest of the season, and finish fourth. That's our priority.\" \"The atmosphere is very bad, the mood is very down,\" Gallas added. \"Everybody is worried because at the beginning of the season, everybody was talking about us \u2026 we play good football, we can finish third, we are 10 points in front of Arsenal [on 25 February]. Now we are behind them and we have lost the semi-final. We have to work very hard to come back, to fight to finish fourth. But it will be difficult because Chelsea and Newcastle are behind us and after the semi-final, Chelsea will be very strong. They will finish very well so we have to finish well, too.\" Tottenham's next three matches are against Queens Park Rangers, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers, teams who are fighting to avoid relegation and they are sure to be high-pressure occasions. It was interesting that Redknapp pointed out last week that Newcastle still had to play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and \"both teams couldn't win that one,\" which might benefit Tottenham. The manager has clearly scrutinised the run-in and every conceivable permutation. Chelsea also have to visit Arsenal and Liverpool. Tottenham finish against Aston Villa and Fulham. \"It's been a tough season physically but we can't look at that,\" Parker said. \"At the end of the day, we're still amongst it and I think something like the Chelsea result might just kick us on, if we try and get that siege mentality. People are doubting us, whether that be our own fans \u2026 even our own manager, probably, at this moment in time, is doubting us a little bit. We need to stand up and be counted, show the fans and show him probably that we're going to try and end up fourth. That's what we're trying to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
