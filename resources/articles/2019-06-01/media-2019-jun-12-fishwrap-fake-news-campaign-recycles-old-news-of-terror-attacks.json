While the identity of those running the campaign is unknown, the group has been dubbed \u201cFishwrap\u201d by Recorded Future\u2019s chief technology officer Staffan Truv\u00e9 \u201csince it uses old news for new purposes\u201d. The Fishwrap campaign was discovered while monitoring social media platforms for reports of terror attacks. In the process, a network of more than 200 accounts was discovered that were talking about attacks not reported elsewhere \u2013 attacks which, on closer inspection, were supported by links to real news stores about historical attacks. \u201cThey were talking about them as though they were new, but linking back to the old news stories,\u201d Truv\u00e9 said. \u201cThese could have all been independent, but then we found that they were all using a family of URL shorteners. And all these URL shorteners were running on an anonymous Azure service. So this made us understand that this was a larger campaign.\u201d The report claims: \u201cThe fact that the operation has been going on for close to a year, and that it is spending money on numerous domains on dedicated servers, leads us to believe this is not just someone running the operation \u2018for the lulz\u2019, but rather a political organisation and/or nation state with an intent to spread fear &amp; uncertainty, and track followers of the posted links.\u201d The accounts shared \u201cnews\u201d about incidents such as the 2015 Paris terror attacks but with the date and other context removed in an apparent attempt to make the news go viral a second time. \u201cThere are two candidates here,\u201d Truv\u00e9 said. \u201cIt\u2019s either a state-sponsored misinformation campaign, or it\u2019s a domestic alt-right thing, because it is focused on terror events to do with Muslims. Or it could be what we call \u2018operational preparedness\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re up, active, creating history for themselves and their accounts, and then they want to use it in the future to spread original fake news.\u201d But without specific information about the users that only the social networks have access to, Recorded Future cannot be more definite in its attribution. \u201cWhichever way this is set up \u2013 they\u2019re not breaking any laws, they\u2019re not breaking even the terms of use of Twitter,\u201d Truv\u00e9 said. Misinformation campaigns, also known as \u201cinfluence operations\u201d, frequently use a combination of technical and societal factors in an attempt to spread propaganda. For instance, a computer vulnerability may be exploited to register hundreds or thousands of fake accounts, which are then deployed to influence curation algorithms and boost a particular news story or topic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
