We should put on a big concert to raise awareness and stop the violence, Boris, if your [sic] listening, call me man.\" Evidently, listening he was because call her he did: the pairs City Hall meeting last Thursday became the latest sleb/politician pairing... Bono and George Bush After a White House meeting in 2003 to discuss the Aids crisis, Bono declared: 'The President's emphasis upon anti-retroviral treatment represents a true paradigm shift.' We never got to hear Dubya's explanation of a paradigm shift, 'true' or not. Tony Blair and Bob Geldof At a 2005 MTV forum Blair wore a manic schoolboy grin as Geldof lolled against his shoulder, a finger raised coquettishly to his chin.

Happily, we never had to witness the Colombian popstrel teach the Prime Minister to dance. Nelson Mandela and the Spice Girls Swapping the long walk to freedom for the short skip to Girl Power, Mandela met Ginger, Sporty et al in 1997. His unlikely enthusiasm for all things Spice has lasted ever since."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
