In fact Arup estimated the cost of the project (which involves tunnelling a high-speed rail line from central London to Heathrow) at \u00a34.5bn (The fast and the furious \u2013 why new route will be controversial, 7 August, page 12). In our high-speed rail series, a head-and-shoulders shot was used that purported to show Sir David Rowlands, the chairman of the High Speed Two company, behind the north-south plan (Project leaders enthuse about new line's benefits, 7 August, page 12). However, the person shown in the topmost photo was Sir David Rowland, the former NatWest chairman. A brief article about the death of the film-maker John Hughes said that he directed Home Alone. Hughes did write the film, but Chris Columbus was the director (Breakfast Club director dies, aged 59, 7 August, page 24). In the obituary of the politician and writer Shafiq al-Hout, his name was misspelt as Shaifiq in early editions of the newspaper, 7 August, page 37. We credited the recording of Emanuela Galli singing arias selected primarily from Monteverdi's Scherzi Musicali (also the title of the disc) to the Naxos label. It is in fact released by Glossa (Classical reviews, 7 August, page 11, Film &amp; Music). It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
