But the shared message was one of defiance. Sandwiched by two examples of Gabriel Jesus\u2019s curious reluctance to shoot when he had only the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat came a new addition to the City songbook. \u201cFuck you Uefa, we\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d were the lyrics and who, a few years ago, thought they would be singing about the court of arbitration for sport rather than Sergio Ag\u00fcero or Kevin De Bruyne, that they would be watching one of the most successful sides in English history and chanting about the connotations of allegedly inflated commercial revenues? In a sense, they were correct. As Soriano said emphatically earlier on Wednesday, City will appeal against their two-year ban from the Champions League. The court of public opinion at the Etihad Stadium would not have found in favour of European football\u2019s governing body. One banner behind the goal where Rodri struck proclaimed \u201cUefa mafia\u201d. Another homemade effort read \u201cUefa scam\u201d. Some, perhaps, would have selected a different vowel in the second word. A third said \u201cUefa cartel\u201d, which isn\u2019t a noun often found on placards at football grounds. There was something of a siege mentality and perhaps City\u2019s strategy has helped to generate that. And yet this was not a cauldron of hate. The loudest chants were more upbeat affairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Guardiola,\u201d for instance, which was sung lustily. Pep Guardiola, that improbable successor to Brian Horton and Alan Ball, is set to stay for a fifth season, with or without the carrot of Champions League football. There was \u201cCity, the best team in the world\u201d, a sentiment they used to voice in the knowledge it was preposterous. There was \u201cwe\u2019re not really here\u201d, which dates back two decades, sung when their peers were Macclesfield, not Real Madrid, and York, not Juventus, and reflects the surreal nature of City\u2019s recent history. Many were there watching mediocrity and glory and, whether or not their trophies were tainted, will be there again. Above all there were the salutes to Pablo Zabaleta, the West Ham substitute who was making his final appearance on the ground he graced for nine years. Signed a few weeks before Sheikh Mansour\u2019s takeover, his brand of wholehearted commitment made him a City cult hero. The Argentinian has lost the power that allowed him to hurtle up and down the right flank but not his place in supporters\u2019 affections. He exited the Etihad Stadium with arms aloft, acknowledging the appreciation. A last goodbye to Zabaleta energised more fans than any bitterness towards anyone else. The difference in the decibel level was instructive. There were clearly some, even if it is impossible to prove how many, who joined in the chants in support of their club, their manager and their returning favourite, but not those against Uefa. It is probably simplistic to talk of the vocal minority and the silent majority but no fanbase is homogenous. There are the realists and the extremists, those who seem philosophical and those who feel persecuted. There are those who want to know more and those who made their opinion apparent. More than once, they sang the name of Mansour, the man who bankrolled their rise; suspiciously, Uefa feels. The songs about the Glazers and Mike Ashley do not tend to be flattering but City\u2019s fans are altogether fonder of their owner. Soriano, one of his key lieutenants, had claimed Uefa\u2019s allegations are false. There were times, though, when he looked bored on Wednesday night in a match lacking in intensity and, at times, atmosphere, amid a sense that the destinies of these clubs will be decided on other days; in City\u2019s case, in a different environment. There was vitriol but also, as Moonchester defeated Hammerhead in a race between the mascots, frivolity and normality. The mood before kick\u2011off was of quiet contemplation. A ground sometimes derided as the \u201cEmptihad\u201d had more empty seats than usual, though that could have been because those who bought tickets for the original game were unable to attend a rearranged fixture. Storm Ciara had forced a postponement 10 days earlier. Storm Uefa may yet do more lasting damage to City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
