Or, for that matter, is there really a mutuality of interest between print editors and broadcast news chiefs? After sitting through last week's society of editors' conference, in which it is assumed that all editors are kindred spirits, I would question that premise. Though they undoubtedly share similar problems in news-gathering and are subject to the same laws and restrictions, their response to them and their daily experiences are very different. This reality was punched home time and again. When Charles Moore, editor of the Daily Telegraph, sought to explain the struggle of trying to sell a million copies amid a national price war it had little resonance with the mission of Drew Cochrane, editor of the Largs and Millport Weekly News, to raise his weekly sale to 5,500. Well, at least they were both talking about the difficulties of attracting readers. But what on earth could they learn from Barrie Stephenson, managing editor of BBC Radio York? Nor could I grasp what synergy there might be between the achiev ement of Jim Moir, controller of Radio 2, and the editors of the Metro and Bath Chronicle in discussing how to bridge the age gap. This mismatch became clearer still when Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, and Ian Mayes, the paper's readers' editor, explained the mechanics and effort involved in apologising for mistakes. Various regional and local editors pointed out that they didn't have the resources to deal with readers in this way. Anyway, I suspect that the whole ethos underlying Rusbridger's address about the virtues of saying sorry were lost on them. Too many editors still believe that owning up to errors in print is a matter of last resort. But there were moments when the gathering of editors from disparate places did make sense. A discussion of the hoary old issue of whether the media are guilty of dumbing down showed that, in print and broadcasting, there is an understanding that the marriage of tabloid presentation and broadsheet analytical rigour makes news more accessible. The swapping of tales about the way in which the law intrudes into journalism was also useful. The fight waged by Paul Horrocks, editor of the Manchester Evening News, against legal restrictions on his paper was as relevant as that by Neil Wallis, editor of the People. But what was striking was the yawning gap between life on provincials and life on the national papers exposed by the interventions of the northern organiser of the National Union of Journalists, Miles Barter. He took every opportunity to point to the low wages paid to too many junior and senior journalists, and to the continuing squeeze on salaries by regional owners who demand high profit margins. His allegations were strenuously denied by senior executives but, privately, many editors told me they agreed with Barter. Peter Cole, professor of journalism at Sheffield University, pointed to another scandal: the misuse of the work experience system in which wannabe journalists are expected to work for free. One magazine, owned by an international company, even expected one woman to spend a year on work experience. This is 19th century exploitation reborn in the 21st century media world, a scandal that all editors should strive to outlaw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
