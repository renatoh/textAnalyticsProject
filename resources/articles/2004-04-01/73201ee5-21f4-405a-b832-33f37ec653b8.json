What was true in 1937 is doubly, even trebly, true today. In the tide of new fiction that floods the bookshops each season, there are very few bottles with messages worth lingering over. From 1937, the books that remain probably include Woolf's The Years and Tolkien's The Hobbit. To open your secondhand copy of almost any other novel published in the 1930s and browse the end-paper advertisements for Painted Butterflies or A Lonesome Road is like taking a stroll in a remote country churchyard. Who was Victor Sampson? Why did the Manchester Guardian describe John Glyder as 'a master of riotous laughter'? The world of books is immune to intimations of mortality. Its default mode is hyperbole and its basic instinct is for celebration. What other branch of the contemporary arts gives away so many annual prizes? Aventis, Thomas Cook, Orange, Smartie, Samuel Johnson, Trask, Whitbread, Booker, Bad Sex... the rollcall of literary laurels signals many things but none more publicly than the triumph of hope over experience. The disparity between the high claims of the principal prizes and the quality of the contenders has become so glaring that it has become impossible to take some of the over-publicised long- and shortlists seriously. But not this year; 2004 is promising a vintage harvest. In fiction alone, weeks before some of the big publishers have committed their best bets to the annual lottery, there are several major novels in contention both for new readers and for the most glittering literary prizes. First, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas is a remarkable new novel by a significant talent. Next, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's The Master has been praised in these pages. Finally, there is the novel which The Observer described as 'a classic for our times', Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty . These three alone are going to give this year's judges the kind of feast that those who have been adjudicating in previous years of famine, will look on with envy. And all three will inspire fierce debate. From a longer perspective, each of them expresses an explicit debt to the English tradition. Mitchell riffs cheerfully on literary conventions from Defoe to Aldous Huxley. T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Hollingsworth have been inspired, in different ways, by the life and work of Henry James. Come September, when David Lodge's new novel Author, Author is published, James will have scored a remarkable posthumous hat trick as the subject of three contemporary novels. This column has already noted the current revival of interest in things Edwardian. If 2004 is already shaping up to be a bumper year, just look at 1904. It's a century since James published The Golden Bowl . He was competing for review space with Conrad ( Nostromo ), Rolfe ( Hadrian the Seventh ) and Chesterton ( The Napoleon of Notting Hill ). I would cheerfully sit down and reread any one of these. Real novels have long afterlives and many offspring. \u00b7 robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
