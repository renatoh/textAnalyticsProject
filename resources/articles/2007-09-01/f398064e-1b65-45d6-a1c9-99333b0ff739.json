The Germany captain is currently recovering from ankle surgery and does not figure in his club's 23-man party for the group stages of the competition. Chelsea insist they took the decision because they could not guarantee Ballack would be fit for the majority of their six group matches, suggesting he will not return until the end of October at the earliest. But the player said: \"I am disappointed. But I have to accept it and focus on getting healthy again. Then I can make up my mind about other things.\" The 30-year-old was unable to name a date for his long-awaited return from a nagging ankle injury. He continued: \"It has got better - but it is not like I could play again or train with the team. I can't give a prognosis.\" Ballack is currently in Cologne, where he met with national team coach Joachim Low following Germany's 2-0 victory over Wales on Saturday. Ballack also revealed that he will work out in a special shoe manufactured just for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
