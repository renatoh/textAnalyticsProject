He could watch on, helpless, as the local car manufacturing industry fell apart around him, or he could put his skills to better use. Bowtell used his redundancy payout to set up a 3D printing facility in a small warehouse on Victoria\u2019s Bass coast, where he began manufacturing free prosthetic hands for children with a disability. Now, as Covid-19 fractures the economy and brings entire industries to their knees, Bowtell\u2019s skills have again found a new purpose. Fourteen of his 20 3D printers are now being used to manufacture thousands of face shields for healthcare workers, who are struggling to access personal protective equipment amid widespread shortages. \u201cWith 3D printing, we\u2019ve been able to go from making hands to making face shields in a matter of, well, days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTo completely revamp our line, that\u2019s how agile this technology is and how flexible it is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d Bowtell\u2019s story is not unique. All across the country, catastrophe has caused remarkable transformations. Industry in the pandemic age is finding strange ways to meet the strangest of demands. Local gin distilleries are making hand sanitiser. Carmakers are offering design expertise for hospital ventilators. Detmold, a food packaging company, is now producing surgical masks. Textor, a company that previously created materials for nappies, sanitary pads and baby wipes, has repurposed its business toward personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of the CSIRO. The manufacturing industry\u2019s guide during this pandemic-induced transformation is the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, a not-for-profit working with the federal government. It is trying to help the sector pivot into Covid-19-related work, setting up a central portal where businesses can register their skills, supplies, and capabilities. \u201cOnce we set up the portal, heaven broke loose,\u201d the AMGC managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, told the Guardian. \u201cUp to today, we had 1,000 registrations from companies who not only said \u2018I want to help\u2019, but they said how they could do that.\u201d \u201cSo that means we can make a heat map of different skills and capabilities, which we can then throw at the most targeted need.\u201d The speed of the pivot has been remarkable. But it has also raised a broader question. Before the crisis, only a single Australian factory, Med-Con\u2019s Shepparton plant, was producing surgical masks. Similarly, there was only one significant onshore producer of ventilators, a company named Resmed. Labor senator Kim Carr, a former industry minister, says this highlights a failing that extends well beyond just PPE and ventilators. How, he asks, has Australia allowed key strategic industries to disappear? And why has it taken a crisis for Australia\u2019s shortcomings to be so greatly exposed? \u201cThis is a profound problem now,\u201d Carr says. \u201cFor even the most simple-minded of our rightwing economists, understanding the implications of these matters surely now demonstrates the importance of us developing a more economically complex society and a more sovereign nation.\u201d The consequences of shortages in PPE, as one example, have been thrown into sharp relief in recent weeks. The paucity of supplies forced hospitals to stop elective surgeries and left aged care providers with serious threats to their ability to deliver services. Workers at dialysis units have been left to scrounge for their own masks, despite their patients being one of the most at-risk groups from Covid-19. A cancer treatment centre had to begin producing its own sanitiser using donated chemicals after vast quantities mysteriously went missing from its stores. Catholic Healthcare Australia, which represents members with 80 hospitals, warned the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, the situation was dire and that it held \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about PPE access. Local manufacturing has now become a critical part of the pandemic response, both in Australia and across the world. The World Health Organization has urged every country to boost its domestic PPE production by 40%. \u201cWithout secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real,\u201d WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cIndustry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can\u2019t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first.\u201d The Australian government has responded with a multifaceted strategy. It issued a callout to domestic industry to understand who may be able to pivot into PPE manufacturing, while releasing stocks from the reserves in the national medical stockpile. It has also sent the army in to help Med-Con, which is aiming to double or triple its production. Exports of PPE have also been banned. Some say Australia\u2019s current situation exposes a failing of crisis planning. The chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the gradual offshoring of PPE production was \u201cclearly extremely risky\u201d in the event of a pandemic. \u201cThis situation should prompt a rethink of our approach over the past several decades to move away from domestic manufacturing towards a reliance on imports,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may save money in the short term but it is costing us now. In a wealthy country like Australia, it is unacceptable to risk the lives of health professionals because we do not have the facilities to manufacture simple materials such as masks and swabs.\u201d Unions take a similar view. The national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union, Paul Bastian, told the Guardian: \u201cI think this crisis has certainly exposed the dangers of destroying Australian manufacturing and relying entirely on an import-based model. \u201cOf course, as we move forward out of this crisis sometime in the future, we hope that government continues to invest in Australian manufacturing, as they have to do right now when they don\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d Adamm Ferrier, a lecturer in public health at La Trobe University who helped set up Health Purchasing Victoria, agrees that there has been a \u201cmovement offshore of many manufacturing processes to countries where labour costs are more competitive\u201d. But Ferrier also says the problem is partly explained by the way hospitals had changed their stocking of PPE in recent years. \u201cSince the 1990s there has been a movement towards a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply practice that replaced a \u2018just in case\u2019 practice, where hospitals held vast quantities of supplies that often went out of date,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018just in time\u2019 practice has served the system well, but was always predicated on the ability for the manufacture and medical supply chain to respond nimbly to changes in demand.\u201d Goennemann, a leader in the industry, disputes suggestions that manufacturing is in decline in Australia. He is careful to distinguish Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector from what people generally associate it with \u2013 producing things in factories. Production, he says, is just one part of the manufacturing process, along with research, development, design, logistics, distribution, sales and services. In fact, Goennemann said Australia may be uniquely placed to respond. He points to 3D printing, of which Australia has an \u201cincredible onshore capability\u201d, as an example. \u201cThe 3D printing capability onshore is a massive distinguisher for Australia to step up to the crisis,\u201d he said. When asked how else 3D printing might be deployed in practice, Goennemann points to the supply of ventilators, which are needed to assist breathing in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients. A lack of ventilators has been a critical issue in countries like Italy, where doctors in swamped intensive care units have been forced to make heart-wrenching decisions about who gets access to the life-saving machines. Australia has about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country. The government wants to increase the number of ICU beds dramatically to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, and is attempting to source more ventilators through a combination of domestic production, procurement from abroad, and the conversion of existing equipment, including from veterinarians. Goennemann says Resmed, the main ventilator manufacturer, could struggle to get parts due to the disruption of global supply chains. That\u2019s where 3D printing can help. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of Resmed, but that\u2019s an area where we have critical supply, and parts can be 3D printed onshore rather than being procured offshore,\u201d he said. The industry minister, Karen Andrews, is heading up the government\u2019s efforts to ramp up domestic production of PPE and ventilators. A special unit has been convened within her department to specifically look at PPE supply. Andrews says the response of industry is a testament to the ingenuity that exists in Australia. \u201cSo many companies are putting up their hands to help \u2013 whether it\u2019s ramping up manufacturing, looking to switch up what they produce, or even just connecting with each other to make sure they have what they need,\u201d she said. For Bowtell, the decision to shift his production to face shields had nothing to do with profit. It was about doing what he could in the most extraordinary of times. \u201cIt\u2019s about survival at the moment,\u201d Bowtell said. \u201cJust helping people to get through this together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
