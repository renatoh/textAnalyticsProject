But the case of A v B, which opened at the new supreme courttoday, has a significance that goes way beyond the banal soubriquets of the two sides. It involves secrecy and the security services, and could expose agencies to a scrutiny they have never had before. The case will determine whether complaints against them could be heard in British courts or merely in a tribunal which can meet in secret and against whose decisions there can be no appeal. A in the case is a former member of MI5. B is described as the security service's \"director of establishments\" \u2013 in effect, its chief human resources officer. A has written his memoirs. MI5 wants to delete some passages. A wants to challenge the excisions in the courts, saying that only there can he properly argue his case, notably the principle of freedom of expression enshrined in the Human Rights Act. MI5 says he must take his case to the investigatory powers tribunal, which largely decides its own procedures. It was set up under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to give members of the public the possibility of complaining about the conduct of the security and intelligence agencies, notably about abuse of power and the way they monitor an individual's movements and communications. It is understood that the tribunal has never upheld a complaint. Crucially, it can hear evidence in secret and no court can appeal against its decisions. Critics of MI5's case say the tribunal was never meant to adjudicate on what a former \"insider\" \u2013 in this case a member of MI5 \u2013 can publish. In the supreme court today, Gavin Millar QC, for A, argued that his client would not be given a fair trial, also a right enshrined in the Human Rights Act, at the tribunal. There was a \"fatal flaw\" in MI5's case that the tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction, he told Lord Phillips, president of the supreme court, sitting with Lords Hope, Brown, Mance, and Clarke. The issues and principles involved were much wider than issues relating to \"national security\". MI5 lost the case in the high court but won in the court of appeal. After more than a year, it has now reached the highest court in the land. It was first reported in March 2008 that the government had begun a legal battle to stop a former undercover MI5 agent publishing a book on the inner workings of the security service. It was described as a \"detailed expos\u00e9 of the operational successes, failures and recruiting techniques of the covert organisation\". The former MI5 officer was described by the Sunday Telegraph as a former member of the special forces, who penetrated the IRA, organised crime gangs and more recently recruited agents to infiltrate jihadist groups plotting terror attacks in Britain. The newspaper said the book revealed how the former agent, who had been decorated for bravery, was recruited and trained to developed multiple identities which he used to penetrate criminal and terrorist networks for more than 15 years. The memoirs are also said to describe how he developed post-traumatic stress disorder after years working undercover in dangerous situations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
