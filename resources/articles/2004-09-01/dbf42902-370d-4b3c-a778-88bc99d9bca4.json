Provided that rival bidder Santander's offer document is sent to Abbey shareholders in the next few days, HBOS chief executive James Crosby will call a board meeting where he is expected to receive unanimous support for a bid offering Abbey shareholders about 700p a share. Observers warn that the timing of the bid could slip, but that HBOS is 'psychologically prepared' for hostilities to begin against Santander almost immediately. HBOS's offer would value the former building society at \u00a310.5bn against an all-shares bid from Santander, the Spanish banking giant based in Madrid, which values Abbey at just shy of \u00a39bn. But Santander is expected to sweeten its offer. A revised package would include a cash element, 'which could be worth several billion', said one investment banker. Crosby has the full backing of the bank's chairman, Lord Stevenson, and other non-executive directors. But City sources say HBOS may opt for a bid that would be conditional on its offer not being referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading. If HBOS stepped back in the event of a referral, Crosby would still have secured two objectives. The first was attained last week when Santander said it was selling half its shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and that its alliance with RBS would be scrapped should it acquire Abbey. Crosby has been worried that RBS could leverage its alliance with Santander to allow the two to work together against HBOS in the event of a Santander victory. His second objective, to force the Spanish to pay more for Abbey, would also have been attained. Investors expect HBOS to launch a bid, despite suspicions in some quarters of the City that Crosby could ditch his plans at the last minute. The only issue to be resolved is whether Crosby should pursue a bid for Abbey in the event of a referral, which would carry the risk that the authorities would block HBOS on competition grounds. If HBOS bought Abbey, the combined company would control 34 per cent of the mortgage market and 29 per cent of savings, but would speak for a relatively small part of business banking and current accounts: about 15 per cent. It was the potential impact on competition in current accounts and small business banking which persuaded the regulator to block Lloyds TSB's bid for Abbey in 2001. If HBOS bids, Lloyds and other high street clearers may also enter the fray."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
