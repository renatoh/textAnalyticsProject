Here I'm not talking about watching history being made or hearing Barack Obama's speech or anything like that. I just mean the social aspects, which really are the point if you're here for six days and nights waiting around to hear speeches that fill just one hour of each day. Conventions are strange social experiments. You take 20,000 people or so and cram them into a city. Except that they aren't exactly crammed, because they're spread out all over the place, especially in a roomy city like this one. I was just on the phone with the editor of a magazine. He's way out in the boondocks. He's a prominent fellow, too, from a prominent publication. And we were chuckling because another friend of ours from an even more prominent publication is 15 minutes farther out on the periphery than he is. We at the Guardian lucked out. More precisely, we're enjoying the residue of the perspicacious move by Carol K., the manager of our Washington office, who booked us into the Warwick before the Democratic National Committee had blocked off every hotel and motel room within a 30-mile radius. We're three blocks from the glorious Brown Palace Hotel, a sort of social nerve center for the week, and four from the 16th Street pedestrian mall, several blocks of shops and restaurants, some nice and some really cheesy, as we Yanks say. Cheese (kitsch, essentially) is central to any political convention. A Democratic convention isn't a zoological cornucopia in the same way a GOP one is, because at least Democrats are humans I can basically relate to. But liberal school teachers from California are no more immune to cheese than born-again mid-level managers from Tennessee, so the already-tacky tchotchke shops on 16th Street have added, to their normal stock of ceramic wildlife figurines and Denver Broncos gear, tacky and over-designed Obama/Denver t-shirts. There are cops everywhere on 16th, and I mean cops, with nightsticks the size of baseball bats and enough riot gear to take on the Madhi Army. This outfitting would seem to be designed for the protestors, but they're nowhere near 16th. I passed them in a cab this afternoon. They're in a park or plaza down by the courts building, about a five-minute drive away from the pedestrian mall. There were right-wing picketers with a \"Friends of al-Qaida\" sign (that would presumably be the Democrats, not the picketers themselves) and left-wingers across the street who seemed angry about the usual hodgepodge of matters. They're safely away from the Pepsi Center of course, but all things considered I think they got some pretty nice real estate, which speaks to the sense of fairness and decency of folks who live in a place like this, where most people still assume that other people are going to act in good faith. Speaking of the Pepsi Center, I haven't laid eyes on it yet. It's a couple of miles away. One of the key questions about any convention is whether there's a place to get a drink near the hall. The best convention ever was the Republican one in San Diego in 1996. The convention hall was attached to a hotel, and the hotel bar was converted into the journalist refueling station in short order. You'd walk in there and see loads of people you knew. Not sure what the Pepsi Center holds. The Huffington Post has set up an \"oasis\" near the hall where the idea is very anti-booze-ish. The invite says the oasis will offer complimentary yoga classes, Thai massage and reflexology, mini-facials and \"music and room to lounge.\" So that's a taste of what it's like. I'm sure the Guardian's intrepid video team, here in full force, will provide some images of all this as the week goes on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
