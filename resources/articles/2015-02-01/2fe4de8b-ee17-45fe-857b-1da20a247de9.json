Opening with John F Kennedy\u2019s \u201cWe choose to go to the moon\u201d speech, the album continues in the London duo\u2019s theme of putting stories of human endeavour (previous work has tackled climbing Everest and the invention of colour TV) to the tune of madcap meanderings. Veering from krautrock to ambient postrock, Gagarin is a celebratory, if rudimentary, funk jam; Valentina (a tribute to the first woman in space) is given a welcome lustre with additional vocals from folk duo Smoke Fairies. However, it does little to provoke. While rightfully allowing the brilliantly executed collection of archival footage of human voices to flourish, its subtlety makes it more conceptual art piece than experimental rocket ride."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
