He finished his maths homework late the night before so he could dedicate his weekend to campaigning for Tory defector Mark Reckless. \u201cA moment ago someone said I was a member of the Nazi party,\u201d says Wood as he sits on a stool in a former crystal healing shop and centre for Wiccan worship currently being used as the Ukip headquarters in this month\u2019s byelection. \u201cI was nine when we had a Ukip leaflet come through our front door,\u201d recalls Wood. \u201cBut my interest came during the coalition, when I disagreed with certain policies. Ukip was the first party that came to mind.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see how Wood, an articulate first-generation \u201ckipper\u201d and son of a Baptist minister, might quickly be cultivated as a young pinup for the Ukip press machine. He already has his own business, Eagle Travel, designed to stop people \u201cgetting ripped off on their holiday\u201d. He claims to offer more competitive prices than Thomson or Thomas Cook. Over the past few months he has already made a profit of \u00a3450 \u2013 slightly better than the average pay packet of a paperboy. But this isn\u2019t unique: a 16-year-old William Hague was paraded in front of the Conservatives\u2019 1977 conference. And in 2011 Rory Weal, also 16, became the star of the Labour conference after his attack on the coalition. What is different is that, for the first time, thousands of young people in classrooms, universities and workplaces are looking for an alternative to the politics that have alienated them. While membership of Ukip\u2019s youth faction, Young Independence, remains modest, they have gained 900 members since February and now have 2,600 dedicated young kippers canvassing up and down the country. It\u2019s not just Ukip that is trawling for votes and members among young people disillusioned with the traditional parties. The Young Greens have seen the greatest swelling in numbers, with a 165% rise in membership, going from 1,700 members to 4,500 in under a year. \u201cI think that now we\u2019re offering young people a proper alternative to the status quo,\u201d says Siobhan MacMahon, 26-year-old co-chair of the Young Greens. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t necessarily think that makes us a protest vote. We\u2019re reflecting the views of a lot of people now and I think that we\u2019re really capturing the momentum.\u201d Young Labour and Conservative Future still have most members \u2013 20,000 and 15,000 respectively \u2013 but as more young people seek an alternative, the presence of the established parties appears to be stagnating. At Bath University, support for Conservative Future collapsed to the point that it was disaffiliated from the student union. \u201cAs far as I know, Ukip is the only political society applying to be there,\u201d says Jack Duffin, chairman of the UK Young Independence movement. \u201cRecently we\u2019ve had three students from the University of Exeter contact us, expressing a wish to set up a Young Independence society.\u201d In a recent poll by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, just 11% of 18-to-24-year-olds said they would vote for the Conservatives if there were a general election tomorrow, as opposed to 12% for Ukip and 19% for the Greens. In the same poll, the Liberal Democrats came out on a par with the British National party, both securing a meagre 2% of the 18-to-24 vote. \u201cI was a Liberal Democrat,\u201d admits 21-year-old Ukip Students chairman Joe Jenkins. \u201cI campaigned and told all my friends to vote for the Liberal Democrats because \u2018when we go to university it\u2019ll be free\u2019. And then for me to turn around and tell my friends, \u2018Oh, sorry, they lied to me too\u2019 \u2013 it was ridiculous. I\u2019ll never forgive them for it.\u201d Under his leadership, Young Independence launched Ukip Students this summer and has established 18 societies in universities across the UK, with a particular stronghold at the University of Chester. But the youth wing of Ukip has had more than its fair share of damaging controversies during its growth spurt: British-born Sanya-Jeet Thandi, once described as a \u201crising star\u201d by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, quit the party this year, claiming that Ukip had \u201cdescended into a form of racist populism that I cannot bring myself to vote for\u201d. And in January, Olly Neville, leader of the young kippers, was sacked from the party for his stance on gay marriage. Despite this, the Young Independence numbers continue to climb. \u201cOne of the things that has attracted so many young people to Young Independence recently is a focus on domestic policies, not just Europe and immigration,\u201d says 17-year-old Joshua Jones, who is now in charge of whipping the young kippers into action around the east Midlands (and is possibly the only teenager in the country to still say \u201cjolly good\u201d). \u201cI\u2019m not trying to disguise the fact I\u2019m something of an eccentric,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo be interested in politics, and to join a political party at such a young age, you have to be a little different.\u201d While Farage and his older entourage hammer on about the perils of immigration, the youth movement sticks to education and taxes. \u201cI didn\u2019t really care that much about the European Union when I joined Ukip,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI was attracted by the education policy mainly.\u201d He will certainly be considered \u201cdifferent\u201d when he goes to university to read history \u2013 this year the National Union of Students denounced Ukip as a \u201cracist, xenophobic, homophobic and sexist organisation\u201d. Last week the NUS decided against condemning Islamic State. For the 22-year-old co-chairman of the Young Greens, Clifford Fleming \u2013 also a former Lib Dem \u2013 it was the possibility of an alternative and a swing to the left of the establishment that attracted him. \u201cYoung people are becoming more and more alienated by politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI realised quite quickly that Labour wasn\u2019t this super-leftwing group that wanted to make everywhere so much more equal. I looked at their policies and none of them really addressed anything; they just kind of skirted around the edges. \u201cI joined Young Greens because the Green party offers lots of alternatives that are different from what everyone is saying. The Green party doesn\u2019t think in five-year terms. We have a much longer trajectory of trying to create a better vision \u2013 and I think lots of young people are turning to us because of this.\u201d Young Greens and Young Independence may have little in common ideologically, but they share two things: a swelling in their numbers and a rejection of the political establishment in its current state. What we are experiencing is a revolution in youth politics. Both reflect a disillusion with the scrapping of the education maintenance allowance, the tripling of university tuition fees, the proposal to scrap benefits for those under 21, and attitudes to young people summed up by former Tory cabinet minister Lord Tebbit\u2019s view that young unemployed people should be made to pull ragwort from roadsides in return for state support.
