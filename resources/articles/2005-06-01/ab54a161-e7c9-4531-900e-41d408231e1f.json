The excitement proved too much for Amanda Janes. She was given a wild card into the event but was on her way out of it in 63 minutes. Worse still, her 6-1, 6-1 defeat by Natalie Dechy, the world No18 from France, was so full of errors and head-shaking that it set off banter about falling British bodies signalling the onset of Wimbledon and that the cards to be awarded them are jokers. It was a testing sea-breezy day with straining flags, clinking haliards and balls that twisted one way and another. But Janes was at a loss to explain why she played so poorly. \"I was anxious this morning,\" she said. \"I tried to loosen myself up but it showed.\" Perhaps her mind was on next month's wedding after which she will be Mrs Keen. How appropriate that name will not be known until December, when the British No2 decides whether or not to continue. Home hopes now rest with Elena Baltacha, who today faces Conchita Martinez, the former Wimbledon champion who, at 33, is the oldest singles player on the WTA Tour and possibly the most cunning. Kim Clijsters, whose comeback in April saw her win back- to-back titles before a knee injury broke her momentum, will hope to regain it against Jelena Jankovic, who took Maria Sharapova to three sets in Sunday's Birmingham final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
