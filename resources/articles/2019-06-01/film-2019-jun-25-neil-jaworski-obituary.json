He worked on films with Working Title and Aardman Animations. With the actor and writer Sally Phillips he co-wrote The Decoy Bride (2011), a romantic comedy set in the Outer Hebrides starring David Tennant, Alice Eve and Kelly Macdonald. It had a sophistication reminiscent of the screwball comedy films he loved \u2013 from Monty Python to Woody Allen. Neil was born and brought up in Bury, Lancashire (now in Greater Manchester), the son of David Jaworski, an insurance broker, and Carol (nee Mallinson), a bank clerk and playgroup leader. At school \u2013 Holly Mount primary, St Gabriel\u2019s RC high school and Holy Cross College \u2013 Neil was a dazzling student; also a gifted actor and mimic. He studied English literature at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1997, and went to work for the agency Marketing Manchester, coining slogans such as \u201cWhere there\u2019s muck, there\u2019s brasseries\u201d to promote the city\u2019s new wave of restaurants. But soon he landed a place at the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. In a life filled with great loves \u2013 music, mosaics, architecture, literature, theatre, the history of magic \u2013 film reigned supreme. His knowledge was vast and he elevated besting people with film trivia to an Olympic sport. At film school, his work picked up numerous awards; the animation Brand Spanking (2004), which he wrote and produced, won best new British animation at the Edinburgh international TV festival, and the live action drama London Fields are Blue (2004), which he produced, won the outstanding directorial achievement award from the Directors Guild of Great Britain. As soon as he graduated, he started working as a freelance screenwriter in London. In addition, he was also a shrewd buyer and seller of film posters. He championed the designer Saul Bass and also the neglected German artist Hans Unger, spearheading a campaign to restore his reputation through an exhibition at the Highgate Society. Neil changed any room he entered, seizing hold of conversations and taking them somewhere magical. He went by many names \u2013 Neil, Nelson, Noo Noo \u2013 depending on his audience, and insisted on immediately renaming all the children in his life \u2013 nephews, nieces, godchildren \u2013 to suit his own comic ends. His laugh rolled like a barrel, coming from deep inside, and he delighted in the wit of others. His death was unexpected, and comes at a moment when his work was deepening. He was co-writing a film for David Livingstone/Calamity Films and StudioCanal based on Man on the Run, the biography of Paul McCartney by Tom Doyle. Another project, with Aardman, Fly By Night, was in the pipeline. He wrote beautifully and there was much more to come. Neil is survived by his parents, his sister, Melanie, his brothers, Philip and me, and by two nieces and two nephews."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
