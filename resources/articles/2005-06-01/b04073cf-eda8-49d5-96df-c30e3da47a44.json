For many, the key criteria for deciding which camera to purchase will be how many megapixels it can capture. But is there more to buying a camera than totting up its megapixels? \"There is a false perception among consumers that the more megapixels a digital camera has, the better,\" says Tim Potter, image capture manager HP UK &amp; Ireland. \"For everyday photography, three-to-four megapixels is more than enough to achieve the desired photograph and indeed enlarge the image to A4-plus size.\" So what else should consumers look for when buying a digital camera? Just follow our top tips. \u00b7 Useability \"There's little point in having a large camera stacked out with facilities if you are not going to take it anywhere,\" says Vic Solomon, product intelligence professional at Canon UK. \"It might be worth considering a compact model if you are going to use it more.\" John Dickins, marketing manager imaging systems Pentax UK, agrees, citing \"styling, size and ease of use\" as the key factors for consumers to consider. \u00b7 Zooms It is easy for companies to add powerful digital zooms, but they are largely irrelevant unless users want to home in on a subject from a significant distance. Solomon believes \"a good 3x optical zoom will be more than enough for most digital camera users\". \u00b7 LCD monitors While a large LCD monitor, such as the one on Sony's DSC-T7, can be a strong selling point, resolution is arguably more important than size. This is because the user needs a sharp monitor to be able to read menu instructions, sometimes in poor lighting. \u00b7 Image processor All digital cameras have an image processing system that takes the images from the chip and then, by adjusting elements such as exposure, colour balance and sharpness, delivers the image. However, some are more sophisticated than others, and it is hard to judge a camera's processor without seeing the images it takes. \u00b7 Flash There are essentially two types of flashes on consumer digital cameras. Strobe flashes, which fire a series of lights, and constant light. If you intend to use the flash heavily, go for a constant light - these deliver more natural images as subjects tend to react less to them. \u00b7 Intelligent facilities Most cameras boast a range of auto-exposure modes, such as sports options for capturing fast-moving objects. There are, however, some intelligent modes that are worth investigating, such as Nikon's Face Priority, which automatically senses the presence of a face and adjusts the focus accordingly. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
