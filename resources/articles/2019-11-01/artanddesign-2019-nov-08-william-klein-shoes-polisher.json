Signs shout about movie boxing hero Rocky, money, beer and cameras. In an era when this area of central London was infamous for the sex trade, only men pound Klein\u2019s pavements, the women waiting in backstreet rooms. Putting the boot in \u2026 Typically for Klein\u2019s street photography, it feels off-the-cuff. Yet for all its energetic chaos, this is a picture with a message, not least about power relations within urban life. It\u2019s the guy getting his DMs shined by a cowering boot polisher who eyeballs us at the centre of the image. Against the grain \u2026 An untrained original, Klein pushed experimenting with his medium to the hilt, using chance, blur and graininess, over- and under-exposure, weird angles and closeups to capture the urban experience, its codes and libidinal currents. Included in Shot in Soho, The Photographers\u2019 Gallery, W1, to 9 February"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
