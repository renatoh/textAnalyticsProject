His pursuit of a seamless flow between various composed, improvised and ethnic musics results here in a complex, kaleidoscopic, multi-idiomatic work. A baroque fanfare opens Charmediterran\u00e9en, with Monteverdi's L'Orfeo followed by emphatic big-band conversations, chattery free passages over motorbike sounds from Gianluca Petrella's trombone, delicate Iberian-flavoured soprano sax against classical strings, and fidgety free-drumming against abstract electric guitar, slowly edging into straightahead swing. Anouar Brahem's subtly nuanced oud playing, both solo and in a trio setting with Gianluigi Trovesi's plummy clarinet and Damiani's cello, represents some of the most captivating music on the disc; Damiani's cello reverie on his own Argentiera, meanwhile, provides the set's most eloquent melody. By contrast, some of the orchestral work sounds overblown and unresolved, as if daunted by its huge cross-cultural mission. Mike Gorman Trio The Maze (33 Records) *** The Maze is an acoustic piano-trio swinger from young Sheffield-born pianist Mike Gorman, with Jeremy Brown on bass and Matt Skelton on drums. It is pretty hard to make your own song on this much-travelled road, but Gorman has strong technique and a subtle touch. He also chooses a repertoire that is both in the tradition and a little off the track. The pianist gives a bright and effervescent double-time account of Charlie Parker's Quasimodo and a rolling (if slightly indecisive) Latin angle on Sonny Rollins's Airegin; he also suggests a potential for harmonic boldness and structural independence on a more personal If I Should Lose You. A disc that will probably get lost in a big crowd, but a developing local player worth keeping an ear out for. Louis Hayes and the Cannonball Legacy Band Dreamin' of Cannonball (TCB) **** TCB, the record label of the Montreux jazz festival, sees itself as bearer of some weighty responsibilities. One of them seems to be to clarify the genre-blurring of contemporary music, to which end TCB puts out its products with helpfully colour-coded spines: red for bop, yellow for \"new grooves\", black for world music, blue for the Benny Goodman tradition. Although this could be problematic for some, Louis Hayes's Cannonball Adderley tribute band can have no complaints about getting a red label: their music is vintage bebop from the first note to the last. Hayes is a superb bop drummer, with Art Blakey's steamy ferocity and an unrelenting determination to goad soloists. As a one-time member of Cannonball Adderley's band in the late 1950s, he is well-placed to keep the torch burning. The Adderley band's brand of hard bop was characterised by a lot of bluesy call-and-response, themes with wailing gospel undercurrents, heated soloing and a percussion style that appeared to oblige the others to dance on lava. The soloists here are terrific: Vincent Herring's alto sax exudes earthy soulfulness, while trumpeter Jeremy Pelt catches the right blistering attack. The repertoire is a hard-bopper's delight, with Bobby Timmons's Dat Dere and Nat Adderley's Work Song mixing with Broadway standards; in this style, the themes are peeled off and binned pretty fast. Hayes himself sounds as fearsomely irresistible as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
