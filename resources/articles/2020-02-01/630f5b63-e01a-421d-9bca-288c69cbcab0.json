The 85-year-old businessman and his daughter Amanda claim that his twin brother Sir David\u2019s three sons \u2013 Alistair, Aidan and Howard \u2013 as well as Aidan\u2019s son Andrew were parties to the recording of their private conversations over several months. Barclay and his daughter are bringing a legal action alleging misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws against their four relatives, and Philip Peters, who \u201cholds a board position\u201d in the Barclay group of businesses. According to PA Media a high court judge sitting in London was told on Monday that the \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d only came to light last month when Alistair was filmed \u201chandling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz\u201d. Desmond Browne QC, representing Frederick and Amanda Barclay, said: \u201cWe all remember Tolstoy saying \u2018each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u2019. \u201cHere, the children of Sir Frederick and Sir David have been at odds ... concerning the family trusts, and cousin, sadly, has been pitched against cousin.\u201d He told Mr Justice Warby: \u201cIt is alleged that the defendants have surreptitiously recorded the conversations of Sir Frederick and his daughter Amanda, both between themselves and with others, over a period of months.\u201d Browne said it was not clear how long the recordings were made for, but they \u201ccould go back as far as September last year\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe defendants knew the conversations were private and confidential, but they nevertheless recorded them, commissioned transcripts and then conducted discussions about them.\u201d He argued there was a strong case that there had been \u201cillegal activity over a long period of time\u201d, which he said had produced recordings of \u201ctremendous value\u201d to the defendants. Browne added: \u201cThe matter came to light when the first defendant, initially the only defendant, Alistair Barclay, was filmed late on the night of 13 January handling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz, which was known to be often used by Sir Frederick. I gather it was somewhere he could go to smoke a cigar.\u201d Browne asked the court to make an interim non-disclosure order, preventing the defendants from disclosing the recordings. Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, submitted that there was \u201ca lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients ... which they have got completely free of the recordings\u201d. She added that her clients had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to \u201cspread it about before an injunction\u201d was granted, but there was \u201cno evidence of dissemination\u201d. Rogers argued that there was therefore no need to make an interim non-disclosure order. Giving a short ruling dismissing the application for a non-disclosure order, Warby said the claim \u201cstems from the falling-out between elements of the families of Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay\u201d. He said that \u201csubstantial parts of the business enterprises\u201d the twins had built up \u201care now owned by trusts, beneficiaries of which include\u201d Amanda, Alistair, Aidan and Howard Barclay. The judge added that the \u201cvexed litigation\u201d arose \u201cover the governance and direction of the group businesses\u201d. He said the information Frederick and Amanda Barclay were seeking to protect included \u201cdiscussions about potential acquisitions and disposals of business assets\u201d, and \u201cpersonal financial matters including matters relating to the family trusts\u201d. Warby declined to make the order sought, ruling that \u201cthere was no intention and no evidence of any intention\u201d to disclose the recordings. The Barclay Brothers who, have owned the Telegraph newspaper group since 2004, are reportedly conducting a review of their many businesses, which also include the Ritz in London. Profits at Telegraph Media Group slumped to \u00a3900,000 last year, in the middle of a turnaround plan led by the chief executive Nick Hugh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
