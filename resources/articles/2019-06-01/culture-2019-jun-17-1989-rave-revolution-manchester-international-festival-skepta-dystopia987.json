It felt like a heady, celebratory time.\u201d At the time, Manchester seemed to be the epicentre of the change. The city was making headlines, local bands were the toast of the music industry, and, as Harris recalls, \u201cthe Ha\u00e7ienda really was the greatest night of your life\u201d. As part of Manchester international festival 2019\u2019s Interdependence line-up, the Guardian is hosting a session exploring the meaning and manifestation of modern revolution, rooted in the unrest and joy of 1989. The 1980s and the times we now live in share a certain turbulence, yet the mood of 1989 offers hope that change can, and will, come. \u201cFundamentally the 80s was a very divided, painful decade. The era of Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike, nuclear paranoia \u2013 it was a nervy time. Then right at the decade\u2019s end, the mood turned,\u201d says Harris. \u201cCreativity was a reaction to what happened.\u201d As the mood turned, so did the music. The clubs were quickly becoming filled with garish, psychedelic patterns and the city began to move to an electronic beat. From A Guy Called Gerald to Happy Mondays, Manchester had a new rhythm, and rave was at its heart. Rave is a recurring theme across MIF19, with Skepta\u2019s Dystopia987 inspired by Manchester\u2019s acid house-drenched, late-80s rave scene. \u201cA rave is a place to open your mind,\u201d said the Mercury prize-winning artist, speaking at the festival\u2019s launch. \u201cRave is a place for love \u2026 I feel like clubs in general have turned into places for this new individualism where people are just on their phones to have a \u2018fake good time\u2019, so we\u2019re taking people\u2019s phones away from them.\u201d Insta-individualism may have replaced the community spirit, but Skepta hopes his show can rekindle some of the togetherness: \u201cGoing to a rave was all about love and being together with people. We\u2019re going to bring people together to make a good, good atmosphere.\u201d While Dystopia987\u2019s name hints at a grim vision of the future, it\u2019s the light at the end of the tunnel that most interests Skepta. \u201cI\u2019m talking about getting to utopia,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have to destroy to rebuild. We have to go down to make things better. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say too much about it, but we\u2019ve brought lots of different people together: creative technology experts, writers and a great team to make a world. So, it won\u2019t just be about rave it will be what I believe rave will be for in the future, why people will come to the rave.\u201d Skepta\u2019s show will infuse the 21st century with the spirit of rave. Similarly, Dave Haslam, an author and former DJ at the Ha\u00e7ienda, is inspired by the lasting impact of that burst of late-80s creativity: \u201cArtistic activity defines the soul of a city in a way blocks of apartments and shiny retail piazzas don\u2019t. I\u2019m proud of the way the Manchester dancefloors drew in people of many different backgrounds. That was part of the spirit of the times \u2013 the inclusivity. Many of our clubs and venues are still like that, and that\u2019s very valuable.\u201d Haslam has programmed a series of events for MIF19\u2019s Festival Square programme. \u201cI\u2019ve booked the DJ Black Madonna, and live music from the likes of the Orielles, LIINES, the Blinders and Witch Fever,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking: if I was still at the Ha\u00e7ienda and I wanted to capture the same sense of adventure, who would I book?\u201d All these events are looking to the past in order to forge a way forward. The positivity of 1989 promised a bright future for Manchester, something that Harris believes came to pass: \u201cIt made the city feel like a playground. It felt full of possibility. I think that was retained in the vision of a regenerated Manchester that came true - that period was central.\u201d The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
