Jones\u2019s side surpassed expectations by reaching the final in Japan and temporarily returning to No 1 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004. They were comprehensively beaten by the Springboks, however, who gained the upper hand at the scrum after Kyle Sinckler was knocked out in the third minute and had to be replaced. England fielded the youngest World Cup team in the professional era in Saturday\u2019s final, with an average age of 27 years and 60 days, and players such as Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Maro Itoje are expected to form the backbone of the side at the next World Cup. Of the 31-man squad, only Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Ben Youngs, Mark Wilson and Willi Heinz are in their 30s but Jones is set to make changes for next year\u2019s Six Nations campaign and beyond. The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, expects England to be \u201call guns firing\u201d during the Six Nations and said Jones\u2019s goal will be to deliver the Grand Slam. Next summer, Jones leads England on a two-Test summer tour of Japan and a significant proportion of the World Cup squad will be left at home. Under an agreement between the RFU, Premiership Rugby and the players\u2019 union, any of the 32 players who make 20 or more appearances in the 2019-20 season is not allowed to go to Japan. \u201cI tell you what happens to teams \u2013 they evolve,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSome guys will lose desire, some guys will lose fitness, some guys will get injuries and there\u2019ll be young guys come through. So this team is finished now. There will be a new team made. We\u2019ll make a new team for the Six Nations and that new team for the Six Nations will be the basis of going to the next World Cup. \u201cBut I\u2019m so proud of the players, the way they\u2019ve prepared, the way they\u2019ve worked. They\u2019re great ambassadors for the sport and great ambassadors for England and I\u2019m disappointed there\u2019s such a negative attitude about our performance. We\u2019ve just taken a team that couldn\u2019t get out of the pools and just got beaten in the final and there\u2019s all this negativity about their performance.\u201d Jones cited the fatigue of his England players who toured New Zealand with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2017 as a key reason for his side\u2019s dip in form the following season. Sweeney said there is no set agreement that dictates how much rest the Word Cup squad will be given by their Premiership clubs. Saracens, however, plan to ensure that their World Cup players \u2013 nine of whom were in the England squad \u2013 are limited to only seven internationals this season. \u201cWe talked about whether there should be a mandated thing for every single player but the preference was to allow it to be at the discretion of the clubs and they are being very reasonable,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey value these top-class players as much as we do so they will be looking after them when we go back. We\u2019d expect them to have a degree of rest but we have left it to a club-by-club basis and discuss it with their players.\u201d Sinckler said \u201cwords can\u2019t do justice\u201d to how he is feeling after suffering a head injury in the final in an accidental collision with his teammate Itoje. It proved a decisive moment with England proceeding to concede six scrum penalties thereafter. \u201cWords can\u2019t do justice to how I\u2019m feeling right now,\u201d the prop wrote on social media. \u201cThe biggest moment in my life and not even being able to get a chance to shoot my shot. Sport is cruel but we can never let adversity get the better of us. \u201cWant to thank everyone for their support especially back home. We as a team will come back stronger. Love playing with my brothers and representing my country is truly an honour every time I get to put on the jersey. Congrats Siya Kolisi and South Africa. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
