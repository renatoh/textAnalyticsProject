The 26-year-old said she was left speechless after being named by Lord Sugar as the winner, receiving a \u00a3250,000 investment from the tycoon. The Leeds-based entrepreneur defeated nut milk drink brand owner Camilla Ainsworth in the boardroom in the final after presenting their business plans to more than 200 experts at London\u2019s City Hall. Gabbidon said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happened. Not that I didn\u2019t think I could win it but it\u2019s just real. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m absolutely over the moon.\u201d She added: \u201cWe went in guns blazing, both of us, we both said things about each other\u2019s businesses, but at the end of the day I did come in this to win. I\u2019m sure Camilla will be massively successful in whatever she does. \u201cFor me, I wouldn\u2019t have entered the show if I didn\u2019t think I had it in me to win. I would say that it is very easy to underestimate how hard the tasks are. I\u2019ll never, ever judge any of the other candidates. It\u2019s so hard to put yourself through the tasks. \u201c[Working with Lord Sugar] is the biggest challenge I have ever had in my life. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let the biggest challenge take me out. I am nervous but I\u2019m ready.\u201d Runner-up Ainsworth, 22, said: \u201cAlthough I would have loved to win, I\u2019m just really proud of myself as the youngest ever finalist of The Apprentice. It takes a while to sink in but immediately I was kind of in fight mode. As a person I am very positive and optimistic. I gave myself a good few seconds to be quite gutted then I thought, \u2018Right, reset and go again\u2019.\u201d In the final episode, the pair welcomed back the contestants Sugar had previously fired to help them create a video advert and billboard for their companies. They then had to give a pitch to a group of industry experts, who shared their thoughts on the business plans with Lord Sugar. Ainsworth said appearing in front of the panel, which included leading business people from the fashion and health drink worlds, had been a frightening experience. After a final impassioned pitch from both candidates, Sugar made his decision. He told them: \u201cCamilla, I\u2019ve said to you earlier on, I find you a big risk, a very, very big risk. Having said that, there is a growing market here. \u201cSian, it\u2019s a crowded market \u2013 that\u2019s a big, big concern for me, but you are an expert in your field, and you are a good designer, there\u2019s no question of that. \u201cI think that yours is a growing market [Camilla], and yours is a massive market [Sian], it\u2019s very tough for me to make a decision. But on reflection, Sian, you have a great aptitude and a talent for design \u2013 you\u2019re going to be my business partner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
