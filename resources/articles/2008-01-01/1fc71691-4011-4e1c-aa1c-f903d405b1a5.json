It is timely \u2013 the corporation will ask listeners for their views and forward them to the government's consultation on the future of social care. A central part of the BBC's activities is built around the \"care calculator\". Developed with the London School of Economics, the care calculator is an online tool that enables people to find out what care is available in England and how much they will have to pay for it. The calculator includes a map with links to local information, including the local council and, importantly, local voluntary organisations which can give an informed but independent view of local services. I'm a former social services director and had an opportunity to try out the calculator before its public launch. It was easy to use and informative. I want to say it was \"fun\", but that is probably the wrong description as the calculator brings home how heavily social care is restricted and rationed. The calculator works out what, on average, people in England are getting. By selecting from a menu of choices about personal circumstances such as family, housing, income, savings, impairment and what help might be needed, information is given about what and how much help you might expect to receive and whether you would have to contribute to the costs. But many people are likely to be disappointed that their expectations are not matched by the reality of social care services today. If I or a family member was newly facing the difficulties of disability, I would use the calculator to find out what help I might get. I would probably find a pretty good match with my circumstances and impairments, and also information about contacts in my local area. And I might even be able to contribute to the future shape and funding of care services by giving my views in the online questionnaire about how social care ought to be provided and financed, including, for example, through taxation, insurance or having to pay directly when help is needed.
