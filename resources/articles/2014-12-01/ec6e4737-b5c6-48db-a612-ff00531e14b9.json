In the business sphere Newcastle\u2019s owner has a reputation as a most demanding employer but Pardew claims to have experienced only his more holistic side. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have a solid relationship with your chairman or owner and I\u2019ve always had that with Mike,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. Ashley confounded many by standing by Pardew as Newcastle struggled for much of 2014 before recently winning six games in a row, but it seems no cross words were exchanged during this prolonged rough patch. \u201cMe and Mike don\u2019t really have too much communication,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we do it\u2019s really constructive. We\u2019ve never had a destructive conversation since I\u2019ve been here. I think that\u2019s very helpful because I\u2019ve had them at other clubs. The link between owner and manager is very important but sometimes it can get lost in the wash a little bit. Chief executives can get involved and the relationship gets distant.\u201d Pardew has been further bolstered by the security of a controversial eight-year contract but feels that both he and Ashley deserve praise for making their partnership work through the tough times on Tyneside. \u201cIt\u2019s credit to the owner and also credit to me because I\u2019ve had to dig in a few times. Sometimes his flag is up the pole and sometimes it\u2019s mine. But I think we both knew that when we signed that long contract, that there were going to be difficult days as well as good days for us both.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager is horrified that his length of tenure makes him a rarity in the increasingly turbulent world of English football. Indeed, only Arsenal\u2019s Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Exeter\u2019s Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson at MK Dons have been in post longer. \u201cI noticed that Mark [Yates] got sacked at Cheltenham, so I think I\u2019m fourth on the list of the League\u2019s longest-serving managers now, which is very disturbing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good stat at all. \u201cSince Tony Pulis left Crystal Palace by mutual agreement a Premier League manager hasn\u2019t left this season, which is unusual. Maybe it\u2019s beginning to stabilise a little bit, although perhaps I\u2019m speaking to soon. The Championship is the bigger worry at the moment, because nine months is the average tenure. I don\u2019t know how long it takes other people to get to know their jobs but nine months is certainly not enough for the coach of a football team.\u201d He can further reinforce his own job security by choreographing a repeat of the 2-0 win Newcastle enjoyed against Chelsea in the Premier League at St James\u2019 Park last season. Thirteen months after that victory Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side have been revamped and Pardew expects a considerably tougher challenge in the north east on Saturday lunchtime. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re on a different level but we\u2019re playing a much better team than came here last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Chelsea since I was 12. I used to watch John Neal\u2019s team on a regular basis but this is as good a Chelsea as I\u2019ve seen. Whether they can continue like this is a big question mark, though, because they have quite a few players who haven\u2019t won the Premier League \u2013 yet.\u201d There seems little chance of complacency in the visiting ranks. \u201cJos\u00e9 knows this is a tricky game,\u201d says Pardew. \u201cHe won\u2019t come here complacent. He never does. That\u2019s the art of his management and something that I don\u2019t think gets carried through at some other clubs. Chelsea certainly won\u2019t go unbeaten in all competitions but it\u2019s not impossible for them to stay unbeaten in the Premier League this season.\u201d An impressive defensive performance by Sunderland earned Gus Poyet\u2019s side a draw with Chelsea at the Stadium of Light last Saturday but Newcastle will not be emulating their neighbours. \u201cNo, we won\u2019t do the same,\u201d said Pardew. \u201cI think Chelsea will score, so we\u2019ll need to score twice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
