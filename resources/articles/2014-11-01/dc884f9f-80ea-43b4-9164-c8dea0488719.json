Ford is set to replace Owen Farrell, with James Haskell and Ben Morgan in line to start in the back row against Samoa on Saturday. Stuart Lancaster said there will be \u201ca finite number\u201d of changes for the Samoa game but conceded pressure is increasing on all involved in the wake of England\u2019s fifth successive defeat, their 12th successive game without a win against the Springboks. \u201cClearly the pressure is on because we\u2019ve not achieved our objective,\u201d the England coach said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any team stops developing or learning but the clock ultimately stops at the World Cup, doesn\u2019t it? You also know if you don\u2019t win in the short term, whilst also trying to develop the side in the long term, then ultimately pressure can be created.\u201d Lancaster is adamant the off-key Farrell will still play a part in England\u2019s World Cup campaign next year and that England are not a million miles away. \u201cIt is important we maintain our belief going into next week and don\u2019t change the course we are on. We will not panic; we will not lose our nerve. There is a strong belief among the coaches in the way we are developing. There\u2019s no sense of the pressure affecting people. \u201cWe\u2019ve had five games against the top two sides in the world and we\u2019ve not been smashed in any of them. We\u2019ve been reasonably dominant in lots of areas. There were definitely times in the game when we felt we were the better team but in conceding points the way we did, through ill-discipline and giving easy points away, we put ourselves under pressure.\u201d Lancaster will make a number of changes for the Samoa game, offering his fringe players a chance to push for selection against Australia next week. Ford is desperate for a start \u2013 \u201cI think I\u2019m ready \u2026 obviously I really want a chance\u201d \u2013 but admits the squad are braced for a tough-talking debrief in Bagshot. \u201cIt could get a little bit nasty but I think we\u2019re an honest team which sticks our hands up and says, \u2018We\u2019re going to get better,\u2019\u201d the fly-half said. \u201cThe two teams we have played against are very good and, if you make mistakes, they punish you. There are areas of the game where we have got to be smarter.\u201d Tom Wood said it is too early for people to write off England. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to lose in an England shirt and you never want to accept that, particularly at home. But the fact we have lost by two really close margins in two really competitive games against the two best teams in the world doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s back to the drawing board and that everyone is on suicide watch.\u201d The Northampton flanker added: \u201cWe have to keep our heads high and keep believing in what we are trying to implement. We understand we will come under a lot of pressure now. The heat is going to come from the rugby media and the rugby public. \u201cEveryone now relates everything to the World Cup but all we can do is stay tight as a group and keep plugging on. We need to get better at doing the simple things better and doing them repeatedly until the opposition crack.\u201d Threats of a boycott by Samoa\u2019s players have been averted following talks with the International Rugby Board but the tour party continue to be unhappy at their treatment by the Samoan Rugby Union. Billy Vunipola, nevertheless, believes it would be foolish to take Samoa lightly. \u201cWhat will they be thinking? I think they are going to smell blood. They\u2019ll think we will be looking at them as a team where we don\u2019t have to prepare that much. We definitely have to prepare well and not underestimate them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
