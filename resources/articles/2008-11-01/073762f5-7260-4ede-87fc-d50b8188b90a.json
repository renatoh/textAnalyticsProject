But dadgummit dagburnit, I think it's inspired, too. Here's why: Daschle is a Washington heavy, a senator for many years before losing a reelection race in red South Dakota in 2006. Obama wouldn't put a heavy in that job unless he intended for it to be a serious job, and that means big health-care reform legislation. Ezra, who wants nothing more for mankind than universal health care in America, can hardly contain himself, and I think he's spot on: This is huge news, and the clearest evidence yet that Obama means to pursue comprehensive health reform. You don't tap the former Senate Majority Leader to run your health care bureaucracy. That's not his skill set. You tap him to get your health care plan through Congress. You tap him because he understands the parliamentary tricks and has a deep knowledge of the ideologies and incentives of the relevant players. You tap him because you understand that health care reform runs through the Senate. And he accepts because he has been assured that you mean to attempt health care reform. Compare the choice of Daschle to Clinton's decision to task Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner with health care reform. Neither Clinton nor Magaziner had any relevant experience in Washington, either with the health care bureaucracy or with the legislative branch. They did not have deep relationships on the Hill or a nuanced understanding of the players. Hillary Clinton had spent the last few decades in Arkansas. Magaziner had helped Rhode Island build a new economic plan. Both of them were, fundamentally, policy wonks. And so they built a process that was, in essence, by wonks and for wonks. The resulting bill might have passed a meeting of the Brookings Institution's Executive Committee. It was an elegant and innovative policy idea. But it was not a robust piece of legislation. It was not responsive to the concerns of the public, and it was not built to win votes in Congress... The choice of Daschle suggests that the Obama team has learned those lessons well. Yesiree. And bear in mind that a top Obama White House aide will be Pete Rouse. He has recently served on Obama's Senate staff, but before he worked for Obama he worked on the Hill for...Daschle. This seems very savvy. Bravo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
