The discussions and possible action reveals a massive rift between the club's hierarchy and their Israeli former coach who, the source said, has always 'considered himself to enjoy a special friendship with the club's owner, Roman Abramovich'. Despite widespread media claims that Grant would receive the full remainder of his contract - a figure reported to be close to \u00a35m - Chelsea are, according to the source, willing to 'pay only \u00a31m'. The source also added that when Grant signed the deal last winter he did not read the terms because of the relationship with Abramovich. 'We have always publicly stated that we would pay Avram Grant under the terms of the contract,' a Chelsea spokesperson told Observer Sport. 'And this is what we will do.' The 53-year-old is still hoping to settle the matter before proceedings, but is being strongly advised that taking Chelsea to court is the only way of resolving the case. 'Avram Grant did not check the contract before he signed it. He believed because of his close personal friendship with the owner that if anything happened over the course of his time with Chelsea he would not be screwed,' the source said. 'And so he also did not ask his lawyers to read it. Avram does not want this to go to court, but he may have little choice.' Grant took over from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho last September and a good start led the club to award him a lucrative new deal (for three years rather than the reported four) in December, believed to be worth just over \u00a31.5m a year. Grant, who was sacked on 24 May, has so far refused to comment on his removal publicly. It is thought that Chelsea believe the terms of his contract allow that Grant should be paid only for one year, and that he is fully aware of this. But, the prospect of a court-room battle will cause disquiet in west London as Chelsea are also currently involved in a dispute with Paul Smith, the club's former acting chief executive. Smith began proceedings last week at an employment tribunal in which he hopes to win a total of \u00a31m in compensation for lost earnings. The hearing has so far heard Smith, who joined the club in 2003, say that negotiations with chief executive Peter Kenyon - who also arranged Grant's contract - were 'like trying to nail jelly to a wall' and of his 'sense of betrayal' at the way Kenyon, a former friend, treated him by not paying what Smith claims he is owed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
