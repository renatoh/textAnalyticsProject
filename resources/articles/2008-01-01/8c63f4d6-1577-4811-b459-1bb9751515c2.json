The announcement is in addition to the pledge made by the schools secretary, Ed Balls, last year to exempt successful universities, colleges or schools from raising the \u00a32m fee to sponsor an academy. It marks a significant change in the funding of the controversial independent state-funded schools. Headteachers said that it showed the academy model was fundamentally changing to encourage them to work as part of groups of schools instead of being modelled on private schools with complete independence. The schools minister, Lord Adonis, said: \"We want more federations led by successful schools. The evidence is that forming a lasting relationship with a weaker school gives the strong school an ideal platform to share its 'educational DNA' for success.\" He added: \"Good schools will be able to spread educational excellence to more children in their local communities. \"In return, partnership with an academy or within a trust offers reciprocal benefits such as staff development, sharing of expertise and best practice and expanded learning opportunities for students. \"Successful colleges should also engage directly with schools because this can raise students' aspirations towards further and higher education, dispelling myths and breaking down perceived barriers to them continuing in learning and training post-16.\" The government also wants successful schools to establish new trust schools - government-funded schools that receive extra support from a charitable trust such as a local business, community group or educational charity. Some 34 schools have already become trusts and 307 more are working towards trust status, the minister revealed. The latest figures show about 30 further education and sixth-form colleges have expressed an interest in the trust schools programme, while a further seven colleges have been confirmed as trust school partners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
