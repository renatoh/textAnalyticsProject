Although it was financed by firms like Norwich Union, KPMG and Nomura which have a vested interest in the outcome, it is a refreshingly non-partisan document. It concludes that the controversial public finance initiative (PFI) has proved value for money in roads and prisons, but not in hospitals and schools. The government's determination to use PPPs led, it says, to shortcomings in the proposed schemes for London Underground and air traffic control (Nats). The tube, it argues, did not need a special PPP because it had a revenue stream from which it could have raised capital in the markets. It adds that there should be no more cases like the Nats project, which went ahead without using a public sector comparator to see whether there was a better public sector alternative. In lots of other cases, there was simply a \"private-sector default\" situation, in which there was no alternative to the PPP on offer. These are such blindingly obvious points that there ought not to be a reason for repeating them. But they need to be repeated because this government has regularly, and culpably, ignored them. The IPPR report makes other \"obvious\" points which ministers ought to be forced to recite every night in case they forget them. It rejects as \"spurious\" the oft-repeated argument that private finance allows governments to undertake more projects than would otherwise be the case. It says: \"All PFI projects are publicly funded and incur future liabilities for the exchequer.\" It also says that PPPs should be used to improve standards and not just to lower costs at the expense of quality. Any fool can take over a public service and then reduce the quality of service, or fire the workers and take them or others back on lower wages. It needs imagination to fuse public and private resources for the common good. But, contrary to some reports, the IPPR is not dismissing the benefits of partnerships which it sees as integral to the evolution of public services. The public sector has always been a partnership with the private sector, which has always undertaken the construction of hospitals, schools and prisons. It is a question of getting the right balance between the two to exploit benefits to mutual advantage. That is, of course, how it should be. The IPPR is, if anything, a bit starry-eyed, even utopian, about the prospects for partnerships. It wants to see an end to privatisation by stealth and a new era in which investment and expertise from outside the public sector (which includes voluntary bodies) will improve innovation and responsiveness without being a source of contention. Investment would not be authorised simply to get it off the public sector borrowing requirement and decisions to use PPPs would be reversed if there was evidence that the public sector was the better option. The report lists lots of different ways to achieve all this - to which we would add one more. There ought to be a college for public-sector management. It could be either free-standing or part of one of the existing business colleges where cross-fertilisation could take place. This is necessary because of the huge damage to morale inflicted on the public sector by 20 years of economic squeeze and false propaganda. It will not be easy to change this culture. And it will not happen at all unless there is a lead from the very top: that means Downing Street."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
