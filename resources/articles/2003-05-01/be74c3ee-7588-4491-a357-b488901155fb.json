A stream of people attest to the fact that it was Bolden's cornet that blasted out over those syncopated beats back in the 1900s that first defined jazz. No one knows for sure, as Bolden never made a single recording and all that remains is a faded photograph and patchy accounts of his alcohol-fuelled life. 'King Bolden' plastered walls by day and plastered himself by night. By 1906 he was the best known musician in New Orleans and was especially popular in the red light district, Storyville. By that time Bolden's drinking was worse, he complained of headaches, threatened his mother-in-law and, in 1907, was committed to an insane asylum where he spent the rest of his life. Bolden never played in public again and he died at the age of 54 in 1931, just before his work attained huge recognition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
