So it is easy to imagine Otto von Bismarck turning in his grave at his great-great-grandson's behaviour. His descendant, the 46-year-old Count Carl-Eduard von Bismarck, has been awarded the title of \"Germany's Laziest MP\" by the media, and provoked politicians' anger across the Bundestag for his apparent lack of interest in the post to which he was elected only in 2005. Protests about von Bismarck's lack of commitment began when he failed to join fellow Christian Democrats on the campaign trail in the run-up to the election. The complaints continued when he was then rarely seen in parliament. The politician has cited back pain as hindering his ability to do the job. But society watchers report seeing him partying when he has claimed to be too ill for parliament. Taking the hint and to the apparent relief of the Christian Democrats, he has now agreed to step down - but not before ensuring his eligibility for the lifetime monthly pension of \u20ac631 (\u00a3450). Under a new law for MPs, he is entitled to this pension if he stays in the job into the middle of next month. Public outrage has grown after it was established that the aristocrat, who is MP for Herzogtum Lauenburg, in Schleswig Holstein, will draw the same pension, after just 33 months in the job, as an average worker would be eligible for after paying into the state system for 24 years. Some have even accused von Bismarck of entering parliament just for the pension. Rasmus V\u00f6ge is one of many leading CDU MPs calling for von Bismarck to step down by the end of the year, when, under the present law, he would get a one-off payment of just a few thousand euros. \"This smells like a deliberate attempt by the count to get a pension,\" V\u00f6ge said. \"In the interests of the taxpayer a resignation from parliament before the end of the year would be a conciliatory gesture.\" But von Bismarck is refusing to alter his plans. \"The date is linked to the handover of my office to my successor,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
