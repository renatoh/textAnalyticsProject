Kuoni, Thomas Cook Signature and Premier are knocking hundreds of pounds off holidays to Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, bringing prices to their lowest level in years. Sri Lankan Airlines has also introduced a two-for-the-price-of-one promotion. The Thai deals are the result of talks at a recent travel forum held in Phuket which was attended by more than 150 Thai hoteliers and travel firms. UK tour operators warned hoteliers that dropping prices was the only way to bring back business now. \"We told them that people will only come now if they feel it's good value,\" said Kuoni product director, Francis Torrilla. But the Tourism Authority of Thailand fears that if prices go too low, it could cheapen the country's image. Kuoni is offering 10 nights' bed and breakfast at the five- star Sheraton Krabi hotel in Thailand between April 30 and May 31 from \u00a3794 - a saving of \u00a3327. Two weeks in Sri Lanka can now be booked for less than \u00a3500 - a price previously unheard of at a time of year viewed as high season. Thomas Cook Signature is offering two weeks' bed and breakfast at the five-star Taj Exotica on Sri Lanka's west coast from \u00a3449 per person between May 1 and June 20 - representing a 50% saving on the normal price. TCS managing director Joanna Edmunds said this particular offer was so good, members of her staff had been booking it for themselves. \"These prices are exceptional and are substantial savings on what were already very good prices,\" she said. A week's bed and breakfast at the Lohifushi resort in the Maldives costs from \u00a3879 with Premier Holidays, a saving of \u00a3142, and valid until March 10. Operators have reintroduced holidays to Phi Phi, after the Foreign Office lifted its advice against non-essential travel to the region earlier this month. Thailand plan unveiled The Tourism Authority of Thailand has launched a recovery plan to rebuild resorts devastated by the tsunami on Thailand's Andaman coast. The plan focuses on the worst-affected areas of Patong and Kamala beaches, Phi Phi island, and Khao Lak, with the aim of creating safer tourist resorts. Details of the plan, to be rolled out over the next two years, were revealed at a forum organised by trade paper Travel Weekly and the tourism authority in Phuket. Among the proposals, protective sand dunes will be created, while new hotels will be set back further from the shore line to minimise future sea damage.
