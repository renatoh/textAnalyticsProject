Department for Education statistics show that for 2011-12 there were 42,900 children subject to a child protection plan in England \u2013 but 166,900 children and families were falsely referred to children's social care services. For the sake of children, the unintended consequences of child protection policy should be part of the debate. This is because the risk of such an overtly suspicious database policy is that some children may never get to accident and emergency because many parents, having previously been falsely charged with child abuse, may find it difficult to approach the system in trust and confidence. Also, consider that a referral of just one child also embroils parents, siblings and extended family. Looked at that way, the number of people falsely embroiled in the child-protection trauma is much higher than 166,900. The government appears unconcerned about the collateral damage to children and families of needless child-abuse investigations which can be impossible to fight. Assuming a default position that every child is at risk and every parent a potential abuser is too suspicious for the general good of all children. Tristram Llewellyn Jones Ramsey, Isle of Man \u2022 So the government is proposing to spend yet more millions of pounds on a new NHS computer system \u2013 this one having the obvious unintended consequence that worried parents will delay or avoid seeking a medical opinion for fear of being put on the child-abuse register and child abusers will avoid the health service altogether. When will they ever learn? The money would be much better spent on supporting families in the community.
