But it is unclear whether the others accused in the case, including a British former detective and the Australian Channel Nine journalist Tara Brown, would benefit from such a deal, with judge Rami Abdullah saying: \u201cThere is no way the charges will dropped.\u201d Faulkner faced court for a second day on Wednesday after she and 10 others were arrested in Beirut last week following a botched \u201cchild retrieval operation\u201d. The Brisbane woman allegedly hired a British-led team to snatch her children \u2013 Lahela, six, and Noah, four \u2013 from their Lebanese father, who had taken them to the country last May and not returned. The Channel Nine crew and Brown were in Lebanon to report the story. The father, Al al-Amin, was reportedly in the court on Wednesday as Abdullah ordered the pair to reach an agreement that could lead to Faulkner\u2019s release, according to the ABC. Faulkner\u2019s lawyer, Ghassan Moghabghab, reportedly said the children were likely to remain in their father\u2019s custody in Lebanon under any deal. The prospects for the other accused looked worse, with Abdullah telling media on Wednesday there was \u201cno way the charges will be dropped\u201d. \u201cThere was a violation of the Lebanese authority by all these people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime.\u201d Brown, who appeared in court with her crew \u2013 Benjamin Williamson, David Ballment and Stephen Rice \u2013 told News Corp the group were being treated well in pre-trial detention. \u201cQuite genuinely we are being treated well by the standards here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine; it\u2019s not crowded.\u201d A Nine Network spokeswoman said it was a relief to know its staff were receiving good treatment. \u201cIt is reassuring and comforting to know they are being treated well and are in good health,\u201d she said. The network was working with a Lebanese legal team and the Australian embassy in Lebanon to \u201cget the team home as soon as possible\u201d, she said. On Wednesday the Lebanese foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, met Australia\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, Glenn Miles, and said a joint committee was being formed to resolve the custody of the children. \u201cAustralians should respect Lebanese laws and the Lebanese should respect Australian laws,\u201d Bassil said after the meeting. He hoped the incident \u201cwould not have an impact on Lebanese-Australian relations\u201d. The case has been adjourned until Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
