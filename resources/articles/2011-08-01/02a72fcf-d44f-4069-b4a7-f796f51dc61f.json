The defender was a passenger in a golf buggy at a club in south Wales on Sunday when the buggy \"lost control\". Tate is not the first footballer to suffer a freak golfing accident, though: Kasey Keller once knocked out his own front teeth when pulling his golf clubs out of the boot of his car. And as freak injuries go, Tate's is hardly up there. After all, the former Croatia striker Milan Rapaic once missed the start of Hajduk Split's season after poking himself in the eye with his boarding pass at an airport. Maybe he had a golf game to get to. Blackburn get in a spot of bother against Everton Blackburn Rovers lost Morten Gamst Pedersen and David Dunn to hamstring injuries, missed two penalties and then conceded one in the last minute. But most ridiculously of all, they even managed to lose to Everton, despite a little known Premier League ruling that says that David Moyes's side are not allowed to win a game in August. Tyldesley puts foot in own mouth to enrage Twitter ITV's Clive Tyldesley received plenty of abuse on Twitter at the weekend. So far, so normal, but this at least had a particular focus. \"Glad I wasn't commentating when Drogba copped a nasty one,\" tweeted Tyldesley. \"Not sure how sympathetic I'd have been. Hope he's OK. Top player.\" Cue a barrage from disgruntled Chelsea fans. Goal of the weekend Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Manchester City v Tottenham Hotspur A sublime goal, reminiscent of Romario in his unplayable form. The Argentinian striker fronted up Michael Dawson at the corner of the box, wriggled irresistibly past him and stabbed a surprise early shot beyond Brad Friedel. Statistics of the weekend 72 Games that Franco Di Santo had played in English football before Saturday, in which time he had scored two goals. The Wigan forward doubled his tally in 69 minutes on the field against QPR. 37 Percentage of penalties that have been scored in the Premier League so far this season, with seven out of 11 spot-kicks missed or saved. When in England, do as the English do. 12 Goals scored by Manchester City in their first three league games \u2013 their best total since they hit 11 at the start of the 1961-62 season, 50 years ago. They finished only 12th that year, mind you. Meanwhile \u2026 in Turkey Fenerbahce's dismal week, in which they were thrown out of the Champions League because of an ongoing match-fixing investigation, took a surreal twist when the club asked to be relegated to the Turkish Second Division. \"Fenerbahce have been the subject of a campaign of denigration. People want to dishonour the club,\" the Fenerbahce vice-president, Ali Koc, said. \"And so our players have signified to us their wish to play in the second division.\" The request was rejected by the Turkish Football Federation although, if Fenerbahce are that desperate, Avram Grant is still looking for a job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
