Hart has not played in the Premier League since 29 November, leaving the goalkeeper vulnerable to losing his place as England\u2019s No1 to Stoke City\u2019s Jack Butland or Everton\u2019s Jordan Pickford, and it is a measure of his reduced status that he will fill in for Adri\u00e1n when West Ham visit Shrewsbury Town in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday. The 30-year-old, who started his career at Shrewsbury, has been disappointing since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City last July. West Ham\u2019s defence has improved since he was replaced by Adri\u00e1n, who impressed in Thursday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. However Moyes insisted that Hart\u2019s immediate prospects did not depend on West Ham going on a Cup run. \u201cJoe will play a lot of Premier League games this season as well,\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager said. \u201cI keep saying it. I thought Adri\u00e1n pulled off one brilliant save at Tottenham when he put a shot over the bar in the first half and he has done well in the games he has played. \u201cI am sure he is not overly happy with it but Joe is a top professional. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s had an understudy to him for 90% of his career and I think he\u2019s acted in a really good manner. I\u2019ve no doubt Joe will play Premier League games between now and the end of the season.\u201d West Ham\u2019s trip to New Meadow will be their third game in six days but a growing injury list could stop Moyes from making changes against Shrewsbury, who are second in League One. Michail Antonio faces a late fitness test on a groin injury and Marko Arnautovic is a doubt after missing the Tottenham game. \u201cMarko has got two tight hamstrings,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cNeither of them are pulled. He only really felt them the morning of the Tottenham game. He is too important to us with the games we have coming up to risk him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
