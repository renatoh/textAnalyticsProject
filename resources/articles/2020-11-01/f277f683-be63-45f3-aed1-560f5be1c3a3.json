Deschamps told the French media Pogba \u201cneeded the right platform\u201d to thrive, apparently hinting that the 27-year-old is not being provided with such a springboard at Manchester United. Indeed, after starring for France during the international break, the \u00a389m former Juventus midfielder could find himself back on Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s bench at home to West Brom on Saturday night. That prospect dismays Deschamps who has said Pogba \u201ccannot be happy with his playing time and positioning\u201d at Old Trafford. \u201cI spoke to Paul today about it,\u201d said Manchester United\u2019s manager. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s not happy when he\u2019s not been playing and not playing really well. He\u2019s not been happy with his [club performances]. But Paul had a difficult season last season. Then he\u2019s had Covid. But three games for France have helped him get his fitness and rhythm. I spoke to him and he feels stronger for it. He plays in the same position for France as he does for us, so that scenario isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d Pogba played for almost an hour in France\u2019s surprise home defeat by Finland before starting \u2013 and impressing in \u2013 the Nations Cup wins against Portugal and Sweden, and Solskj\u00e6r indicated he could be set to regain his United starting place. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting momentum and rhythm and Paul said he felt really strong towards the end of the games against Portugal and Sweden,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Covid he needed time to recover but now he looks fitter and stronger. I think he\u2019s going to improve and be a very important player, and person, for us. To have him in form is vital.\u201d The sense that Pogba could be preparing to leave Old Trafford in the summer was enhanced when a midfielder dropped following last month\u2019s 6-1 home reverse against Tottenham contrasted his delight at playing for Deschamps with the travails of life at Old Trafford as he spoke to French journalists. \u201cI had never known such a difficult period in my career,\u201d Pogba conceded before adding a rather pointed rider. \u201cThe France team is a breath of fresh air. This group of players are exceptional. It\u2019s magic.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s response proved suitably diplomatic. \u201cYou\u2019re happy to see your friends you\u2019ve grown up with on international duty,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the same with Norway. Of course, it\u2019s nice to meet your mates.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
