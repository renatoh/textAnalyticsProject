In that time, some of the committees have established reputations as tough critics of \"their\" departments, while others have been less aggressive. Overall, the system may not have brought the inquisitorial traditions of Capitol Hill to Westminster in quite the way of which some zealous reformers once dreamed - though the fearlessness of congressional committees can sometimes be exaggerated - but the reform continues to provide the framework of a genuinely effective form of parliamentary scrutiny, if not always the actuality. It has rightly always been a precondition for the credibility of the committees that they should not be under the thumb of the government whose departments they must monitor. So it is good news that the government's wish to parachute former ministers into committee chairs has been frustrated this week at the start of the 2005 parliament, just as it was in 2001. Instead, after the inevitable horse-trading, the new line-up of chairs reasonably reflects the mood of the main parties at backbench level, with jobs for Labour MPs who have earned the respect of their colleagues rather than for ex-ministers, as well as a strong handful of Conservatives and an increased Lib Dem representation. In an uneven way, it is a victory for the backbenches and for merit. If that makes life more awkward for ministers, then so much the better. Even so, 25 years on from St John-Stevas, it is surely time for a fresh look at the composition and powers of Commons committees in general, including standing committees on bills. Labour's Graham Allen yesterday suggested a system in which MPs could elect the committees, thus emphasising the key point that the committees should belong to parliament and not to the government. This is an attractive idea, and it should be examined as part of a wider review which the Speaker should establish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
