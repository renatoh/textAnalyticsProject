It is a pity for Moore - and for Jhumpa Lahiri, another short-story writer at Hay - that they aren't eligible for the Le Prince Maurice Prize, set up in 2003 to celebrate the best in literary love stories by British and French novelists. As the prize's president, Tim Lott, has written in these pages, \"Love is still a rich mine for short-story writers such as William Trevor, Alice Munro and Lorrie Moore ... but at novel length, this most ancient of literary seams is struggling to produce gold.\" It could also be argued that all novels are love stories in some way too, but, Lott insists, very few today have love as their central focus, because \"writing with true emotional intelligence is one of the most difficult things to do.\" When he was first approached six years ago to set up an award for a roman d'amour, Lott declined, explaining that romantic fiction left him cold. With a little rebranding - romance became the much more muscular \"literary love stories\" - Lott accepted with integrity intact, and took on responsibilities that include long holidays as a guest of Le Prince Maurice, one of Mauritius's most impressively elegant hotels. Each year since then, the hotel's clientele of honeymooners and the occasional A-list celebrity have been joined for a week by an influx of novelists adjusting their library eyes to the sun. To reflect Mauritius's dual cultural history, the prize alternates each year between British and French jury and writers. The French, traditionally more comfortable with les affaires du coeur, are perhaps less in need of such a prize. And, indeed, the Mauritian judges (who have a role in both awards) have remarked on the tendency of the British novelists to hide coyly behind irony. This year's lucky panel of judges (strictly no celebrities or journalists, as decreed by Lott) were Simon Armitage, Sarah Waters, Irvine Welsh, Joanne Harris, Marina Lewycka and David Nobbs, creator of Reginald Perrin. They joined Lott and the three shortlisted novelists - Salley Vickers, Ewan Morrison and James Meek - for a week's stay at Le Prince Maurice. This must be the only prize where absolutely everyone is a winner, and where author Q&amp;As and a \"Shirobhyanga massage\" can be found on the same itinerary. Imagine the fuss from those grumpy naysayers who like to denounce the Orange prize as sexist - step forward none other than Mr Tim Lott - if the judges were given complimentary massages and facials. Pity the poor author, toiling in solitary confinement for years, treated only to the occasional lunch by their editor, or Twiglets at the odd book launch - few, surely, could be more deserving of a few days of unbridled luxury. But even after a week of snorkelling, saunas and sundowners, they were still doing what, as Welsh admitted, authors do best whenever they get together - grumble. Horror stories of readings in Scarborough and Essex were exchanged over margaritas. Of the three shortlisted novels, Vickers's The Other Side of You, the story of a psychoanalyst and a failed suicide who find a connection through the paintings of Caravaggio, is closest to a conventional love story. Swung, a debut from award-winning television director Morrison, is, to my knowledge, the only novel to be set in the world of Glasgow swingers and to end with an orgy. Whereas Morrison's protagonist is impotent, Adam Kellas in Meek's We Are Now Beginning Our Descent is emotionally blunted. Recently divorced, jilted and snubbed by literary London, he accepts an assignment to Afghanistan, where only the lovely Astrid, a fellow war correspondent, offers hope of healing his wounds. Meek, formerly a reporter for this paper, became the first British male to win the prize (previous winners are Anne Donovan and Louise Dean). More at home, perhaps, in war-torn Afghanistan or Iraq than on the manicured white sands, Meek wins a two-week writer's retreat at the hotel. Goodness knows what dangerous new territory it might lead him to. So what, ultimately, makes a great contemporary love story? According to Welsh: \"Everybody felt differently about it. I like to see the protagonists demonstrate some moral courage in trying to overcome the obstacles they face. Many of the books we read were about people who fancied each other but either wimped out when it was true love, or steamed in moronically when it was just hormonal. Courage and intelligence are the foundations of true love.\" LA So the Richard &amp; Judy bandwagon is finally rolling over the horizon - their Channel 4 show will switch to digital broadcaster UKTV after this summer's run. Publishers hope the pair will continue to inhabit the promised land of book-club success, but many privately fear it will be a bit lonelier on the digital continent. Before they go there's the 2008 Summer Reads series, a reminder of why the entire industry has cherished their so-called \"sofa chat\". The first novel to be discussed, on June 25, will be The Outcast by Sadie Jones (below), published by Chatto &amp; Windus. This striking debut, which started life as a film script, charts the struggles of a disturbed boy in upper-class 1950s England. With critical acclaim and inclusion on the Orange prize shortlist, it has sold an impressive 6,000 copies in hardback; but with Richard &amp; Judy's blessing the paperback should easily pass the 200,000 mark. The pair's final selection, to be broadcast on August 13, is James Bradley's The Resurrectionist - a \"Gothic chiller\", which has sold only 230 copies since publication in 2007. Between these two canny picks sit a couple of punchy thrillers and sweeping historical epics - perfect beach reads. In publishing terms, there's delight for independents Faber (with The Resurrectionist) and Canongate (with Rebecca Miller's The Private Lives of Pippa Lee), while the giant Hachette group boasts five picks across its imprints. The club is the perfect fillip for booksellers after a woeful May on the high street - and they'll deal with the reverberations of the digital switchover later. JR ...#57654; Under the Linden is a small, bold and literally Bohemian festival, due to take place from August 20-25 in the ancient Czech market town of Kamenice nad Lipou, which will bring together an international cast of radical writers, musicians and film-makers to discuss and perform a range of art pieces dedicated to promoting the twin themes of enduring art and cultural resistance. John Berger and the Orange-prize-winning novelist Anne Michaels will present their new collaborative book Rail Tracks, and Don DeLillo's new play about the end of the world, The Word for Snow, will receive its European premiere. Directors such as Sally Potter and cult American exile Eugene Green will introduce their films, while, as part of the programme devoted to the country in which the festival is being held, there will be a special Czech version of the musical Hair Taking its name from an 800-year-old tree in the Kamenice castle once owned by Rilke's grandfather, Under the Linden makes a virtue of its smallness and taps into the same vein of idealism that originally impelled festivals such as Glastonbury. Its own version of Michael Eavis is the Mayor of Kamenice. He has arranged for festival-goers to arrive by steam train and for the town square to be given over to jazz performances; stables will be set aside for traditional Czech feasts. Gareth Evans, one of the festival's organisers, views it as \"a holiday dedicated to the politics of joy.\" Details of how to book tickets can be found at www.gotogetherpress.com.
