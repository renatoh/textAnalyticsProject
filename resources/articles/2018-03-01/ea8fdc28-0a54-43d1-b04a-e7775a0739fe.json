Alderweireld has played only two games for Tottenham since returning from a hamstring injury last month and the centre-back, who will have a year left on his contract at the end of the season, looked rusty despite playing 90 minutes in Belgium\u2019s victory against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The 29-year-old has not started for his club since the 2-2 draw with Rochdale in the FA Cup on 18 February and Mart\u00ednez admitted that Alderweireld does not have long to regain his sharpness. \u201cEvery player needs to get a really good period of football now,\u201d the Belgium manager said. \u201cSeven weeks is not a lot of time. Certain players that play a lot of minutes, the playing time now is not essential. But other players who have not played that much, and Toby can be one of those \u2013 it is important. \u201cBut what you see with Toby is that urgency and the defensive, natural habit of intercepting any threat around him. I saw him really sharp during the camp and [against Saudi Arabia] it was great to see that he was really strong in the last 15 minutes physically. And he lasted 90 minutes in a really good way.\u201d Alderweireld featured in a back three with Jan Vertonghen, his Spurs team-mate, and Vincent Kompany, who insisted that he would not let a long history of injury problems get the better of him. Kompany played the first 45 minutes against Saudi Arabia and the Manchester City defender said that he felt strong before the first leg of his team\u2019s Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a question I literally have to answer every single day of my life but I carry on,\u201d Kompany said. \u201cI take great enjoyment out of always coming back and fighting my way back. I feel good. I\u2019m enjoying my football and I\u2019m enjoying playing with this team.\u201d Kompany is anticipating a tough period for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, who lost 4-3 at Anfield in January. They travel to Everton on Saturday and can wrap up the Premier League title when they face Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on 7 April, three days before hosting the second leg of their Champions League tie against Liverpool. \u201cWe know that as much as we\u2019ve been incredible this season that these games are against teams like United who will want to hurt us,\u201d he said. \u201cLiverpool has been the toughest game so far for us this season. So go steady and we\u2019ll get there and prepare well and be in the best condition to have a good result. \u201cEveryone can see what Liverpool are about. They are a very hard-working team, they have goal scoring threats all over the pitch, not just the main guys. They have strengthened defensively. They are definitely further along as a team than they were earlier in the season and you can see it in the way they\u2019ve been playing recently. But that\u2019s what we enjoy to play against. There\u2019s a lot to say about our team as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
