He will need to be at his sharpest against Jaume Munar, a fiery 22-year-old Mallorcan they call Jimbo (after Connors), who is ranked 88 in the world and whose inspiration is his island\u2019s favourite son, Rafael Nadal. \u201cI am very far away from being world No 1,\u201d Munar told Tennishead.com when it was suggested Nadal and Carlos Moy\u00e1 had set the bar high for Mallorcans. \u201cRafa and Carlos were big, big players and it\u2019s so difficult to get to that level. But, of course, I\u2019m working as hard as I can to get there.\u201d The draw has kept Munar and Nadal apart but he could play a compatriot in Fernando Verdasco if he beats Edmund, who is 57 places above him in the rankings and has had intermittent knee pain since late last year. \u201cIt was a very nice surprise when I saw [the order of play],\u201d Edmund said. \u201cA great honour. Always exciting to be back at Wimbledon and playing on Centre Court.\u201d Having gone out early at the French Open last month, he arrives from Eastbourne with confidence restored after a few good performances, and said: \u201cThree matches inside a week is not something I\u2019ve had for a while. I came through some pressure situations, learned from my loss [in the semi-finals to the eventual champion, Taylor Fritz].\u201d He takes comfort from the fact his last appearance on the game\u2019s main stage was against Novak Djokovic in last year\u2019s second round, when he took a set off the world No 1 and eventual champion. \u201cIt was probably the best match I played at Wimbledon, in terms of level,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was the best sort of atmosphere and match I\u2019ve been involved in at Wimbledon, for sure.\u201d Andy Murray, meanwhile, seems content on a different level, preparing for his return to Wimbledon after two years away, in doubles later in the week. But he revealed he has had the odd problem lately \u2013 with airport security. \u201cI have taken two flights since my hip operation [in January],\u201d he said. \u201cIt went off both times. I don\u2019t really remember it\u2019s in there now. I went through, it went off and I was like: \u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake.\u2019 And then when I got through, my wife was like: \u2018You know that\u2019s because of your hip.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Oh, of course.\u2019\u201d While he and Pierre-Hugues Herbert prepare for their match against the Romanian Marius Copil and France\u2019s Ugo Humbert, Serena Williams\u2019s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, breathed life into the possibility of her playing mixed doubles with Murray. \u201cAs a coach, I would say that\u2019s a great move,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, she loves to play doubles. Second, to play doubles with Andy can bring only positives to her. Andy is great, she likes him. He\u2019s an incredible player, he is super-positive. Why not? They have to just both decide and then \u2026 let\u2019s do it!\u201d Murray is yet to decide if and with whom he\u2019ll play, but said, smiling: \u201cShe\u2019s arguably the best player ever. It would be a pretty solid partnership.\u201d Meanwhile, James Ward, almost the forgotten man of British tennis because of a wretched run with injuries, sounded more upbeat than in recent months when looking forward to his match against Nikoloz Basilashvili on Tuesday \u2013 despite having knee surgery to save his career. \u201cI\u2019ve really picked my game up and beaten some good players the past few weeks. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Ward, 32, who reached the third round here in 2015 and lost in qualifying last year, is ranked 205 and is in the draw on a wildcard. The likable Londoner said of the surgery he needed to fix his patella: \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to move and bend into my right leg. I decided to have the operation. \u201cOn the other side, you lose your ranking, you go down to 900 or 1,000 in the world and you have to start playing qualifiers and play even more matches than you want to. It wasn\u2019t as if I had a new knee. They went inside and cleaned it up a little bit. It\u2019s still not amazing. It\u2019s not ideal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
