Under oath, Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry into British press ethics that he would have \"cut out the cancer\" if he had known about it earlier. Murdoch repeated allegations that Myler, the News of the World's final editor, together with the company's former in-house lawyer Tom Crone, had misled him about the scale of illegal behaviour at the newspaper. Myler and Crone have previously challenged Murdoch's account and called his recollection of events \"disingenuous\". The row has shone a spotlight on Myler, now one of the US's top newspaper editors. He was appointed by Mort Zuckerman, owner of the New York Daily News, to edit the paper earlier this year, giving him a place at the top table of American journalism. Myler declined to comment to the latest set of allegations from Murdoch. The Leveson inquiry was set up by the British prime minister, David Cameron, at the height of the phone-hacking scandal to examine the \"culture, practice and ethics\" of the press. In Tuesday's proceedings, Leveson asked Murdoch, the former chairman of News Corp's UK newspaper division, why he thought crucial information about the extensive nature of phone-hacking at the News of the World had, in his telling of the story, been withheld from him. Leveson asked: \"Can you think of a reason why Mr Myler or Mr Crone should keep this information from you? Was your relationship with them such that they may think: 'Well, we needn't bother him with that', or 'We'd better keep it from it because he'll ask to cut out the cancer?'\" Murdoch replied: \"This is something that I've struggled with as well ... why wouldn't they just come and tell me? I was a new person coming in. This was an opportunity to actually get through this, and they didn't ... I think that must be it, that I would say, \"Cut out the cancer\", and there was some desire to not do that.\" The dispute, between James Murdoch on the one hand and Myler and Crone on the other, will be addresed in a report from another inquiry on the phone-hacking scandal, prepared by parliamentarians on the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which could publish as early as next week. News Corp is also facing an investigation under the foreign corrupt practices act (FCPA) in the US, where the authorities are trying to ascertain the extent to which James Murdoch knew about illegal practices at the media giant's UK newspaper subsidiary. Murdoch has repeatedly blamed his subordinates for what went wrong. He told Leveson that he had no reason to doubt his subordinates when he took over at News International, which published the News of the World, saying he had repeatedly been told that nothing was amiss. \"I was given assurances by them, which proved to be wrong,\" he told the Leveson inquiry on Tuesday. One crucial dispute between Myler, Crone and Murdoch involves how much Murdoch knew about an out-of-court settlement with Gordon Taylor, head of the English Professional Footballers' Association, in 2008. Murdoch said it was \"reasonable\" to leave the settlement negotiations to Crone and Myler. He said Myler and Crone gave him \"sufficient information\" to settle with Taylor but not sufficient information \"to go and turn over a whole lot of stones\". Murdoch said: \"I was given repeated assurances [that the] newsroom had been investigated, that there was no evidence. I've been very consistent about it.\" The House of Commons inquiry was presented with a series of emails that passed between Crone and Myler in 2008 and which in turn were passed to James Murdoch at that time. The emails discussed the now famous communication \u2013 known as the \"for Neville\" email \u2013 that was sent by a junior News of the World reporter to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2008, and contained transcripts of private voicemails belonging to Taylor. In emails that Myler forwarded to Murdoch, lawyers advising the News of the World warned that Taylor wanted to demonstrate that phone-hacking was \"rife\" throughout the organisation and not, as the newspaper had argued, the work of one rogue reporter. In July last year, James Murdoch made similar allegations in front of parliament that Myler and Crone had given misleading testimony, insisting he had never been shown the \"for Neville\" email. Myler put out a joint statement with Crone in which the two men counter-claimed that Murdoch had given \"mistaken\" information to the parliamentary committee. The Commons culture select committee will have to adjudicate on this conflicting rendition of events in its final report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
