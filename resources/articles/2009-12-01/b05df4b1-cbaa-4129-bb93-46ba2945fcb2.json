Ed Balls's department has drawn up plans to offer \u00a32,500 \"golden hellos\" to firms to encourage them to take on young apprentices. The first 5,000 companies to agree to employ and train a 16 or 17 year- old will qualify for the one-off payment between January and April next year. In plans to be set out alongside a Department for Work and Pensions white paper on job creation on Tuesday, Iain Wright, the apprenticeships minister, will announce the new incentives to get work-based training for teenagers who do not want to go to university. Under the existing apprenticeship scheme, young people's training is funded by the government, but they receive a minimum wage of \u00a395 a week from their employer. The \u00a32,500 golden hello will effectively subsidise that wage in a bid to create more places. Balls also said today he intends to scrap a twice-yearly \u00a3100 bonus for 16 to 19 year-olds who stay on at school with a good behaviour and attendance record to fund the expanding number of pupils wanting to remain in education. He said the move was essential to pay the \u00a330 weekly educational maintenance allowance to the burgeoning numbers of post-16 learners from low-income homes. Writing in the Sunday Mirror, he said the change would save \u00a3100m a year and challenged the Tories to match his promise to guarantee all 16 and 17 year-olds a place at school or college next year. Tuesday's plans will set out how the Department for Children, Schools and Education will use the extra money allocated to it in the budget to fund 142,500 more places at school or college for next year than was originally planned three years ago. Last month the number of 16 to 24 year-olds not in employment, education or training rose above the 1 million mark for the first time. Around 13.4% of all 16 to 18 year-olds are not in employment or training, making England's record on youth unemployment one of the worst in the developed world. The government's target is to reduce that proportion to 7.6% in 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
