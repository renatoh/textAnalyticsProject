On Friday, the president forsook his normal audience demographic (2000 Republican protocol droids with their response dials set to \"euphoria\"), to address the Unity Journalists of Color convention. We don't know who is going to be fired for the subsequent pile-up - but for now let's just enjoy the transcript. We join the president soon after he appears to have sensed he is tanking, and attempts to salvage the situation. \"We actually misnamed the war on terror,\" he clarifies. \"It ought to be the struggle against ideological extremists who do not believe in free societies who happen to use terror as a weapon to try to shake the conscience of the free world [laughter]. No - that's what they do. They use terror to - and they use it effectively, because we've got good hearts.\" Golly, but that's a catchy rebrand. Could we now have the longhand for Operation Iraqi Freedom? Only that one always seemed a little overly concise too. \u00b7 Searching to replicate the so-called \"Abu Ghraib bounce\", meanwhile, the state department scores a PR triumph. In order that the emerging Iraq can learn more about the process of government, Colin Powell's lot have sponsored a seven-person delegation of Iraqi civic and community leaders to tour America. Alas, according to the Associated Press, last week's visit to Memphis city hall was soured when council chair Joe Brown refused to let the party in, as he feared they were \"dangerous\". Demanding to know whether the FBI had been informed, Joe told host Elisabeth Silverman, head of the Memphis Council for International Visitors, that he would \"evacuate the building and bring in the bomb squads\" if they entered. Such charming paranoia. Seriously - what kind of socially retarded individuals assume that, to gain access to another country's civic buildings, you just bomb your way in? \u00b7 There are no developments in the British Council's Will Cummins investigation - but then a reader suggests the organisation can tend towards the hapless. She recalls a visit to Jordan in February 1998, when the perceived inevitability of a US and UK bombing campaign against Iraq made the streets feel unusually hostile to westerners. Still, why not take refuge in the magic of the movies? Capturing the mood perfectly, the local British Council cinema was showing The Thief of Baghdad. \u00b7 Can anything dampen the optimism of easyJet? In keeping with the custom of referring to Luton airport as London (Luton) - the accurate description being Luton (Luton) - low-cost airlines have long offered flights to destinations such as Venice (Treviso), and Barcelona (Girona). But even by industry standards, easyJet's latest is audacious. \"Great news for passengers,\" reads a press release announcing new destinations, among them \"Bratislava (Slovenia)\". We suppose 200 miles and a couple of countries away isn't bad. But it might be wise to book your place on the shuttle bus before travelling. \u00b7 Surveillance: Wish You Were Here legend Judith Chalmers, on Saturday, on an easyJet flight to Ibiza. Judith's traditional tan was at the raw umber stage, and we trust she enjoyed her visit to whichever Swiss city she was attempting to reach. \u00b7 An email from rebel Reading East MP Jane Griffiths is the final push we needed to begin development on a vital Diary tool. Namely, is there some kind of algorithm that could be applied to public figures to determine exactly how few people still give a monkey's about them? Jane's suggestion for an item, which mocks John Redwood's private office staff, seems stupidly pointless even by our standards - Vulcan reference or no. Would mathematicians get in touch to tell us how to proceed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
