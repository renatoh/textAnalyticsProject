Michael Hubbard QC, setting out the case for his client in his closing statement, insisted it was \"almost preposterous\" to suggest that Ms Carr, a former classroom assistant in Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman's class, would help cover up the girls' murder. After showing the jury the card that Holly gave to Ms Carr when she left their school last year, he said: \"Maxine adored the children and they her, she loved them. She gave her all for the job.\" He told the jury she agreed to lie for the man she loved, believing him to be innocent of the charges against him, but \"there was another side of Ian Huntley... quite unknown to Maxine Carr. A dark side, an evil side, incalculably evil if you think about it.\" Ms Carr, 26, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender in connection with the deaths the two girls. She has told the jury that she lied to protect her then fiance, giving him a false alibi, but insisted she never suspected he could be involved in the girls' disappearance. Mr Hubbard said Ms Carr had kept her cool throughout cross-examination in the witness box, despite facing a \"fierce\" interrogation - at times more fierce than that experienced by Mr Huntley. \"No matter how many times Mr Latham (for the prosecution) and Mr Coward (for Mr Huntley) put their cases to her, she came back in answer,\" he said. Mr Hubbard said his client had admitted telling a series of lies to police, and had gone to \"absurd lengths\" to try to protect her former lover, even claiming that a crib sheet was in her handwriting when it was \"blindingly obvious\" to the police that it was Mr Huntley's writing. \"She was prepared to say almost anything, and that's why she says in here 'Oh yes, it was my idea'.\" The lawyer gestured to the 166 pages of Ms Carr's police interview, telling the jury to remember that she was arrested on suspicion of murder. He said Ms Carr knew she was not responsible for the horrendous crime but said that the police had put \"scandalous allegations\" to her that she had groomed the girls. He added: \"I'm not making excuses for her, you may think that she deserved to be in that situation because of the untruths she told.\" But he suggested Ms Carr had \"suffered enough\". He asked the jurors: \"Is there anyone you can think of who has ever paid a higher penalty for telling a lie?\" As an example of what she had endured, Mr Hubbard spoke of her experiences in Holloway prison. Ms Carr had said she had not heard the word \"nonce\" before going there and said she had been called Myra Hindley Mark II. The next day photographs of Ms Carr with the Myra Mark II headline had appeared in tabloid newspapers. He said: \"They have been at it 16 months vilifying her. But what evil has she done?\" Mr Hubbard said the prosecution claimed the case against his client remained the same today as it had when the case opened, but he suggested the prosecution counsel must have forgotten a number of points that he had made at the start of the trial. He said the use of the past tense by Ms Carr when referring to the girls in media interviews had been discarded after it was pointed out that the interviewers had also \"slipped into the same trap\". Mr Hubbard pointed to a bus driver's evidence as an example of how witnesses can sometimes get it wrong. The driver had claimed that a conversation he had with Ms Carr about the missing girls had come on a journey between Keelby and Grimsby, but the jury now knew it was the other way round. The barrister said the point by a witness that the card from Holly had been put through the letterbox was wrong and the jury knew the card had been handed to Ms Carr. The barrister said the prosecution emphasised the evidence of caretaker Michael Gee, claiming that Ms Carr had been complaining and scrubbing kitchen tiles so vigorously that the paint was coming off. Mr Hubbard pointed out that in the witness box Mr Gee \"would not have it\" and said that Ms Carr had volunteered the fact the paint was coming off and made no attempt to disguise what she was doing. \"There was nothing furtive at all,\" said Mr Hubbard. Mr Huntley, 29, a former caretaker at Soham Village College, denies murdering the children on Sunday August 4 last year, but has admitted a single charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Mr Huntley's legal team conceded in its closing statement yesterday that there was evidence he was guilty of manslaughter and that he was \"worthy of punishment\". But they said the jury had \"waited in vain\" for evidence that he was guilty of murder. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
