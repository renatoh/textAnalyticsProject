Last November, you will recall, John Prescott, deputy prime minister, and Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, demanded his resignation for publishing memoirs of his life as British ambassador to Washington in DC Confidential. The press being self- rather than government-regulated, it was none of the politicians' business who was in charge, but there were people in the newspaper industry who also felt let down by Meyer's decision to write a book. The politicians complained that Meyer's candour about Foreign Office business made it impossible to trust him with private matters in the future. Prescott, criticised in DC Confidential, asked how Meyer could treat any future complaint from him with necessary impartiality. Many in the newspaper industry were unhappy for the public reason that it looked bad and for the private reason that Meyer's publishers had stitched up a deal with the Guardian and the Mail. Those two naturally did not complain - they could hardly do so, having bought the book - though the Guardian did suggest in a leader that Meyer may have jeopardised the reputation of the PCC. This, I believe, is called having your cake and eating it. Now that the dust has settled, we might pay tribute to Meyer's bravery in continuing to play a role in public life. Many men would have chosen retirement after reading the Daily Telegraph's Craig Brown, who, at the time of the row, produced first a brilliantly cruel parody and then a literary criticism of DC Confidential: \"Had it been marketed as a novel, penned in the first person by a buffoon, it would be being hailed as a comic classic, a sequel to Diary of a Nobody. Our Man in Washington is Sir Christopher Pooter, a model of self-importance and stupidity, his hackles rising at those he sees as barriers to his self-advancement, his knowledge of the world seldom spreading beyond the bounds of received opinion.\" Second, we should acknowledge that Meyer is chairing the PCC rather well. He has been publicising the organisation with roadshows around the country and sees a rise in complaints as an indication that the public is more aware of the PCC rather than a demonstration that the press is getting worse. Last week, he was impressively succinct on the Today programme, implying huge efficiency on the part of the commission. He thinks on his feet too: asked about coverage of suicides at the launch of the annual report, he looked puzzled at the mention of a potential suicide on Big Brother. Presumably it clicked that the chairman of the PCC might have registered the tabloid obsession of the week and suddenly he purported to know exactly what the questioner was referring to. These are not exceptional skills. Many PR men manage them. But they are very different from what has gone before and they promise a can-do approach to solving problems. But is Meyer just a fine front man for an organisation that is - crudely - a fix by newspaper groups desperate to be seen as doing enough to stave off statutory regulation? Or is the PCC acting efficiently in the interests of the general public? David Seymour, the former readers' editor at the Mirror, reckons it is the former. He told Press Gazette last week: \"The party line for all newspapers is that the PCC is doing a fine job ... Now I can say what I really think, and that is that the PCC is doing a hopeless job. It is handing down verdicts which fail to even meet the basic dictates of common sense, let alone justice.\" Other critics believe the PCC is too keen to resolve complaints that ought to be the subject of adjudications. They see the process as a stitch-up, with complainants strong-armed into accepting deals done with papers. They also believe that the fact that the number of complaints resolved following offers from publications has risen by 40% is a worry rather than a matter for praise. On the other hand, the law is increasingly encouraging litigants to mediate rather than litigate and the PCC would have to expand considerably to cope with more adjudications. Call me Pollyanna, but I think the PCC is getting more open and that newspapers are finally beginning to realise that it is counter-productive to assert the accuracy of coverage that is patently not so. Naturally, not everyone is going to be happy, and if I were the PCC I would not make too much capital of the fact that 66% of complainants surveyed found that their complaint had been handled \"satisfactorily or very satisfactorily\". That, I take it, means that a third - about 1,200 people - were dissatisfied with the way the PCC looked into things. Everyone who believes that politicians should keep their mitts off the press has an interest in making the PCC work. If you think it isn't working, write and tell the chairman why. I am sure that, the more letters he gets, the happier he will be. Editors' egos are easily bruised Dear oh dear, where would we be if everyone reacted to coverage in newspapers the way editors do? Earlier this month, I mentioned the John Prescott story, and wrote: \"The Mirror, just when we were all wondering why we kept buying it, pulled the Prescott story off brilliantly.\" The ink was barely dry when an email from Mirror editor Richard Wallace arrived: \"Please, don't bother buying us again . . . 'we' can all cope.\" Now I seem to have upset John Bryant, editor-in-chief of the Telegraph titles, for there is no other explanation for his behaviour last week after the Daily Telegraph invited me to review the British Library newspaper exhibition for Saturday's Arts + Books section. It was my first commission from the paper since leaving - most amicably - last September. As a former director of the Newspaper Publishers Association, I was naturally interested in seeing the centenary exhibition we had discussed. The British Library kindly invited me to a preview; the copy, though I say it myself, was first-rate and I looked forward to my debut as a Telegraph critic. Sadly, it was not to be. My commissioning editor phoned to break the news that the editor had vetoed my appearance in the paper. I was, it seemed, blacklisted. I am all for acts of whim on the part of editors. What is the point of grimping your way to the top if you cannot enjoy autocracy when you get there? But we seemed to get on so well in the days when we met at football rights negotiations with the Premier League. The only explanation is that, in this space a fortnight ago, I wondered why the Daily Telegraph had spiked a penetrating article by its media columnist Roy Greenslade about the Daily Mirror lying to the Press Complaints Commission. But surely not, for a great many people in the newspaper business wanted an answer to that question. First drafts of history So what does the Front Page, which marks 100 years of the Newspaper Publishers Association and is organised jointly by it and the British Library, tell us about the industry? Rather than present a chronology, the curators have worked the exhibition around newspaper obsessions. Front pages give us snapshots of death and disaster, politics, scandal and the royal family. Some of the papers are long dead. Fonts have changed. Design has moved on. What hasn't changed is the thrill papers get from a good murder or beating the Australians at cricket. Here, in newspaper cliche, are the \"first drafts of history\", not only of world wars and the deaths of monarchs, but also of those domestic stories that so excited Britons at the time: the Lady Chatterley obscenity trial or the conviction of the Krays. Just as social boundaries have changed, so the distinction between tabloids and broadsheets blur as the latter take on the interests and the look of the former. The famous Daily Mirror front page of 1936 - \"God save the King!\" - breaking journalistic silence over the love affair of the Prince of Wales, demonstrates that the newspaper industry's ability to combine sycophantic deference with chippy belligerence is nothing new:\"Tell us the facts, Mr Baldwin! The nation insists on knowing the King's full demands and conditions.\" Having invited the Queen to open the show, the NPA fretted that she might notice the unflattering front pages about her family. Cleverly, she was diverted into the virtual newsroom, where a lifesize video loop of the Daily Telegraph backbench and newsdesk plays across a wall. It is very realistic, particularly when the paper's Paul Eccleston appears in the foreground, eating his dinner at his desk. The NPA was founded as a trade body to fight wage demands from the print unions. Now, in its 100th year, it works to promote the industry and protect it from predators, not least the internet. With conventional wisdom having it that papers are on their last legs, all the commentary at the show emphasises a bright future. The effect is curiously defensive. Four bosses - Rupert Murdoch, Lord Rothermere of the Mail, Richard Desmond of the Express and Sir Robert Phillis of the Guardian - appear on video to assure us that all will be well. But the danger of retrospectives is that nothing can be as magnificent as what has gone before. I hope I was wrong in feeling I was at the National Railway Museum in York, looking at Mallard. Killing the romance One of the pleasures of the exhibition is the series of updated Evening Standard front pages from the day of the London bombings last July. So it was particularly depressing to emerge to the news that the Newsquest group is to turn its Lancashire evening titles into single-edition morning newspapers. The company is already abandoning the four editions of the York Evening Press in favour of a morning title. It may be commercial logic, but how it kills the remaining romance of papers. Filing for the internet just isn't the same. \u00b7 kim.fletcher@dsl.pipex.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
