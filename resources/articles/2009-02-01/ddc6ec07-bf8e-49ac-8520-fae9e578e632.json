He wanted no fuss. An essentially shy man, Calzaghe is comfortable in his retreat to the peace of the Welsh mountains that made him, although he will keep himself busy with TV and business deals. It ought not to be long, either, before we see him emerge as a promoter, a career path along which Ricky Hatton and David Haye have started even while still active as boxers. Last night's announcement, which has been some time coming, left no room for inquisition but created a vacuum into which opinions on his legacy will now flood, and it is no hardship from this vantage point to rank the Welshman as certainly the best performing fighter from these islands since the war. No other went unbeaten. No other was a champion for longer. No other wore the mantle of greatness with such a gentle and diffident swagger. He was a great fighter, whatever criteria are used. Some critics will quibble, of course, because that is the way of the sport's commentariat. He slapped, he had brittle hands, he was reluctant to travel further than Cardiff. These snipers want perfection and that quality is reserved in all of boxing for maybe Sugar Ray Robinson, Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano \u2013 and even they had nights they would rather forget. On the world stage he bested all of his contemporaries or at least those versions of them who eventually shared a ring with him. It is true the American legends he beat in back-to-back fights on their home turf, Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones Jr, were old and fading. That was no fault of Joe's; he had been chasing them for years, whatever their protests to the contrary, and they invariably made such demands on the purse split that the fixtures died at the negotiating table. What is undeniable is that Calzaghe housed at the core of his southpaw unorthodoxy a heart as willing as any of us have come across in the sport. It is what defined him because there were moments in his career, especially in some truly testing contests when he was well into his thirties, when you feared he might be toppled. He was down in the first rounds of his fights against Hopkins and Jones, getting up to win; he came through a fierce test of his will against the strong young Dane Mikkel Kessler; and on those nights when the opposition was poor he dredged up a performance to keep that precious unbeaten record intact. There have been silkier stylists, heavier hitters and fighters who made bigger claims with inferior credentials. But Calzaghe was separated from the herd by the one factor that all champions have in common: he was avoided. Joe was not only deeply proud of going out 46 times and coming home 46 times an undefeated fighter. He was also quietly concerned that defeat would wreck that aura. It was worth more to him than the CBE, the MBE and the BBC's Personality of the Year award. It was on a par with another accolade, though \u2013 that bestowed by his father and trainer, Enzo. Enzo, who never boxed, is not only lovably eccentric and almost impossible to understand unless you are Italian, Welsh or standing a foot away from his garbled, machine-gun utterances but he has an uncomplicated boxing philosophy that is difficult to fault. What the father imbued in the son was the simple truth of the ring: speed is all. Joe consistently threw more punches a round than anyone since Henry Armstrong, the extraordinary force of nature who once ruled at three weights. Not all Calzaghe's blows landed; sometimes maybe a fifth hit their target flush. But so quick and muscled were they that they drained the spirit from his opponents almost without their knowing it. You had only to look at Roy Jones's haggard form at the end of their 12 rounds to see the cumulative effect of Calzaghe's blinding punches. It is a pointless if diverting exercise to place Calzaghe above or below any particular British fighter in the history of the sport. It is justifiable, though, to say he deserves comparison with any of them. He would have been as good in any era because his gifts were unique to him. Calzaghe would have posed the same problems to Sugar Ray Robinson, for instance, as Randolph Turpin did \u2013 and I suspect that, unlike Randy, he would have found a way to win a rematch with the game's finest. I'm glad Calzaghe finally made it to Madison Square Garden, boxing's spiritual home. And I'm happy to have been there to see a fine man bring his fighting life to a rousing conclusion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
