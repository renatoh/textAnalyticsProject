One proposal was for a \"super minimum wage\" in which a higher national minimum wage would be guaranteed in return for workers increasing their skills. The idea, called minimum wage plus one and plus two, was put to the business department for inclusion in its skills white paper by the then Treasury chief secretary, Liam Byrne, but was vetoed. In a Guardian article Byrne argues that Labour's election defeat was largely due to what he describes as blue-collar disenchantment, exemplified by the Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy who confronted Gordon Brown during the campaign. Byrne writes: \"What hundreds of people said to me on the doorstep is that 'blue collar Britain' feels like it's struggling alone. It feels battered by the world. And a little let down by Labour.\" Byrne, who is not standing in the leadership election, stressed that he as much as anyone came late to the nexus of issues that concern blue collar workers. He says: \"These are the people who were once the bedrock of our coalition. But their support for Labour has fallen off a cliff. In 2005, over 40% of C2s were Labour. At this election, it plummeted a full 18%.\" He refers to a group that marketeers call \"blue collar enterprise\", which accounts for one in six of people in half the seats Labour lost. He writes: \"All had stories about doing the right thing \u2013 and then finding help just out of reach. This is why so many vented their frustrations with us about welfare reform and immigration. It is a frustration born of playing by the rules yet feeling you live on the edge \u2013 without a lot of help to hand.\" Drawing on Cabinet Office and Treasury research, Byrne put a special paper to the cabinet in April warning a squeezed lower middle class felt unable to get ahead partly due the forces of globalisation making it hard for them to increase their earnings. He said the problem had been building for five years. He said although Labour may have lost some of the Guardian classes due to civil liberties issues, the real electoral problem for Labour was the loss of the mainstream middle class that felt beseiged by squeezed earnings, immigration and benefit cheats. They were also angry at fuel prices, the decision to abolish the 10p tax rate, and felt under pressure on issues such as caring for children or getting them into university. Byrne tabled a series of papers setting out how this group's earnings had been squeezed, and the degree to which they felt those that played by the rules were cheated by the state. He drew some of his ideas from meeting members of the Obama administration's middle class task force chaired by the vice-president, Joe Biden. Byrne argues that Labour needs to find ways of speaking to these people who feel they are unable to increase their earnings even if they do the right thing. He pointed out that retail workers have not seen their wages rise in real terms. Other sectors that feel cheated included construction. The Obama middle-class task force proposed childcare tax credits, a cap on student loan payments and helping workers enrol in savings plans. In America the middle class tends to be seen as a lower income category than in the UK. Friends of Byrne said he found it intensely frustrating when Cameron and the Tories stole the language needed to express this discontent when he spoke of \"the great ignored\". In a separate article for Comment is Free, the former communities secretary, John Denham, agreed with this analysis, writing: \"The genuine effort to tackle poverty created sharp fault lines that cut across the common sense of British fairness. Many could not see why they got little support for hard work, when others apparently received much more.\" Denham writes the Labour ideas such as Sure Start and tax credits were seen as acts of God, rather than products of a Labour government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
