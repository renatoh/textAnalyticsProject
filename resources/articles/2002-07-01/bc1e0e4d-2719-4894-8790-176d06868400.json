It's just over a year since the election. It's been a year when our stock has risen - while the other parties have either stood still, or in the government's case - fallen back. At the May local elections we achieved our highest share of the vote yet. We're at 21% in the opinion polls. And we score even higher with young people. Recent surveys by the Face magazine and You.Gov for the Daily Telegraph put us on 30%. Well ahead of both Labour and the Tories. All of which means we can reasonably claim to be both the party of today, and among the young - we are the party of tomorrow too. And it's \"tomorrow\" that I really want to focus on in this speech. I want to talk about our strategy, where we want to be at the next election, how we aim to get there and how that fits with our core concerns - civil liberties, Europe, the environment and internationalism. I have long taken the view that next time, the election will be fought on one principal issue. The proper delivery of public services approached in a transparent and honest way. To that end, Chris Huhne and his public services working group has spent much of the past year developing proposals for our own distinctive policies and messages in this crucial area. Their thinking has been exciting and imaginative and they deserve great credit for their efforts. Their current focus on earmarking NICs for health, de-centralisation and mutualisation is already energising the debate within our party. Soon, we hope to take it to a wider audience - to the country at large. But before I get into the detail, a quick word about our competition. You'll never hear me talking about New Labour. This is a Labour government - not 'new', but showing distinct signs of premature ageing. Political vocabulary should start reflecting that reality. There's nothing particularly new either about Iain Duncan Smith's Conservatives. They may talk a new talk, but they're not walking any new walks. Ask them about new policies, and all they can say is \"wait and see\". For us, it's rather different. Firstly, we are well-positioned. Having said in June 2001 that, as a nation, we needed to spend more money on public services, Gordon Brown's acknowledgement in his April Budget that we were right - was a huge political gift. All we had done was to tell it like it was. We said that taxes would have to go up - because you can't get something for nothing. That principled, straightforward approach left the chancellor wide open to charges of incompetence or dissembling. Either he genuinely hadn't realized - after one full term in office - that he had not allocated enough money to health; or he knew about it and had kept quiet. Whichever view you take, the public liked what they heard from us, giving us credit for honesty. It represented a clear victory for our views over the need for more funding. On Monday, we can, I think, reasonably expect further confirmation the funding battle has been won, when Gordon Brown introduces his comprehensive spending review. But this is only an interim victory. It isn't the end of the war. The territory that Chris and his working group have been mapping out with great perceptiveness over the last twelve months is concerned now with delivery. Will Gordon Browns billions be spent well and wisely or rashly and ruinously? The Huhne commission has basically identified three areas for immediate consideration: decentralisation, earmarking NICs for health and mutualisation. On all three the thinking is fresh, radical and relevant. It's the basis for a debate - a debate which will first take place at our conference in the autumn. Living in the world's fourth largest economy, we should have first class public services. I want the Liberal Democrats to be leading the thinking about how we achieve them. I want us to be confident about ourselves and strong and positive in our messages and aspirations. I'm certainly confident about de-centralisation. It has plenty of resonance for Liberal Democrats. We have been exploring it for a long, long time. The other two parties can pay lip-service to the concept, but neither will dare to be as radical as we can. Decentralisation plays into our long-standing commitment to regionalisation. I believe it's a theme which will have real resonance for us as this parliament develops, particularly while the government struggles with complaints about micro management and spin. There may be some in our party who are scared of the implications: devolved pay structures, management by elected authorities and professionals instead of Whitehall bureaucrats. But what we are talking about here is accountability. Those who use our public services should be able to deal directly with those who manage and deliver them. It is a central tenet of our thinking that power should be devolved. When it comes to our public services, decentralisation means giving power back to those on the frontline - our doctors, nurses, teachers and physiotherapists and our locally elected officials. De-centralisation is controversial - but that's fine. We should be fearless about having a debate. Over the next few years we can take and test these ideas, adopting those that stand up to scrutiny. I am proud to belong to a party that will do that. I believe it's the hallmark of liberal democracy. And how different that is from our opponents - the control freaks in New Labour and the dictators in central office. It also ensures that we have a pivotal role in the debate - a loud voice with new ideas about delivery. The health secretary is already seeking to hi-jack the term de-centralisation - but it won't stick. His centralist, meddling tendancies are far too pronounced. As for the Tories - whatever Iain Duncan Smith may say - when they finally develop some policies, they won't be de-centralist. The Tories are privatisers. This leader is no different. He is the enemy of the NHS and no-one should forget it. De-centralisation would ensure better delivery in the NHS. But if we turn to earmarking, that is a twin approach which ensures transparency. The Huhne Commission proposal to earmark NICs deserves, I believe, very serious consideration. It's about protecting the health service that the public cares about. The NHS is close to the national heart. The public don't want it broken up - as the Tories keep hinting. The public just wants it to work. If you commit NICs to health, what you are doing is guaranteeing funding. You could call it a national health contribution. What it means is that the public will KNOW that the extra money the government has promised for health is actually being spent on health: the Treasury can't divert it on the quiet. That will strike a chord. It is an extra measure of accountability. t has other benefits. We championed the penny on tax for education. That was a good and popular idea. So earmarking for health demonstrates consistency in our thinking. Once again, it's instructive to compare that with the other two parties. The Tories have a policy vacuum because they are busy trying to prove they are some new kind of party ie: \"not Tories\". While New Labour is struggling to convince its core supporters that it truly represents them. Against that backdrop - the Liberal Democrats stand out. Our ideas are practical, principled and, crucially, straightforward. What you see is what you get. The public services have already dominated political debate in this parliament and will continue to do so. But I also want to talk a little about our wider strategy. This nation is a wonderful, rich tapestry - an ethnically diverse set of communities. And, as that marvellous jubilee parade along the Mall demonstrated, we can afford to celebrate such diversity. And so should we - as a political force for good. In that context, over the next few years my aim and ambition is as follows. At the next election I want us to be central to the political process. In contrast, conservative instincts within our body politic - whether with a small or a capital \"c\" - must be seen to be occupying the sidelines. That's the prevailing sentiment in our nation and we would let ourselves down, and an awful lot of people who will be looking to us for a lead, if we were to aim for less. But that will bring new challenges for us. Matthew Taylor, with characteristic percipience, pointed out a number of years back that we're not always at our best when we're under attack. But if we are to achieve that ambition of moving center stage, then we're going to have to get used to it. If we're serious about ourselves then we can hardly complain when a diligent media get serious about us as well. Be ready for it. In reality, that's what effective opposition is all about. It's not about decibels. It's not about knee jerk reactions, or knockabout exchanges in the Commons and it's certainly not about personal attacks on other politicians. Effective opposition is about delivery. That has to be our mindset. And for me - it is. If you want an example of what I mean by effective opposition and how it should be practiced, look at the recent achievements of our peers in the House of Lords. Shirley and her team repeatedly punch above their weight. It's not just because they hold the balance of power. It's also because they know what they're talking about and their contributions are invariably both creative and sensible: defeating the government to stop the secretary of state interfering in operational matters on the police reform bill; defeating the government on replacing community health councils - there are many examples. In fact, today, they don't always need to go as far as defeating the government in the lobbies because they can use the threat of doing so to negotiate sensible changes in legislation. Against that backdrop, the initial, strategic decision to place in abeyance (the actual word used was \"suspend\") the joint cabinet committee seems to have been the correct one. Of course it was controversial - but it was also necessary. As a party, we are perhaps overly keen on meetings and I'm all for one less - particularly when there isn't currently an agenda! But the political reality is that that decision has allowed us more electoral elbow-room and political flexibility. And the absence of a joint cabinet committee has by no means stopped cooperation or the exercise of joint common sense between ourselves and the government. We do, after all, co-exist in coalition in other parts of the United Kingdom. I am comfortable about taking this Labour government to task about its shortcomings: rational, sustained critique - always backed up by how we would tackle things differently and better - will suffice. And lest we forget, a Conservative revival would be difficult for our future fortunes as well as potentially dire for the country as a whole. The point is that we are now as a party embarking upon a new chapter in British politics where a progressive political force is challenging a large c Conservative party and a small c conservative Labour government. We have to be bold and daring, persuasive and determined. Everything I have seen about our party at work, locally across the country, convinces me that we are up to the challenge. Independence of spirit based upon an independent political base; fresh thinking and innovative policy ideas; a willingness to take risks and, if necessary, to go against the flow. That's Liberal Democracy in action. One year on from a general election, the prognosis is positive and I am optimistic. In one more year's time - providing all of us work with diligence and consistency - our national credibility will be further strengthened and enhanced. Then we can reassess our prospects and potential in relation to the other two main UK political parties. Let's be clear, political destination may yet be some way off, but our sense of political direction is clear enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
