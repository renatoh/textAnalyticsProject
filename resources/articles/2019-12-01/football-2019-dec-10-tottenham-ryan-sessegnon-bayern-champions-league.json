Not just for his transfer to Tottenham, which was years in the making, but for the moment when he steps out as a part of the London club\u2019s starting line-up. At last it is now upon him. The 19-year-old left-sided player will make his full Spurs debut at Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night, which is some stage for a bow, even if the final Group B tie is largely meaningless. The Germans are assured of their progress into the last 16 as group winners, Spurs as the runners-up. Do not tell Sessegnon that. He has thought about being a starting Spurs player from the moment the club made their first serious moves for him, which were in the 2016-17 season, when he made his senior breakthrough as a 16-year-old at Fulham. Spurs\u2019 interest would ramp up. They failed with a \u00a325m bid in the summer of 2018 and they tried again without success in January of this year before they finally got a deal done for \u00a325m in August. When Sessegnon joined Spurs, he was injured, having suffered hamstring damage on England under-21 duty at the European Championship in June. He hoped it would not be too long before he was playing for Mauricio Pochettino; the Argentinian manager was a key reason for his desire to sign. Sessegnon was wrong and, over the first three months of the season, he was a helpless onlooker as the team fell apart. He would catch the dog days of the Pochettino era, getting on for one minute at Everton in early November; 15 at Red Star Belgrade when he made an assist for Christian Eriksen and warming the bench against Sheffield United. But this was not how he imagined it. Enter Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and it is a small example of how little has gone right for Sessegnon this season that he missed his new manager\u2019s first day at the club because he was travelling back from England under-21 duty in Holland. Would Mourinho put his faith in young players, as Pochettino tended to do? It was a question that had to be on Sessegnon\u2019s mind, given Mourinho\u2019s reputation for favouring more established professionals and, when he was the 19th man in Mourinho\u2019s first three Premier League squads, it felt worrying. Sessegnon was an unused substitute against Olympiakos in the Champions League but, on Saturday, he enjoyed a breakthrough when he came on for the final 15 minutes against Burnley. Now for Bayern. Mourinho will make changes as he addresses a clutch of injuries and rests four established players \u2013 Serge Aurier, Jan Vertonghen, Dele Alli and Harry Kane \u2013 although his line-up is still expected to lean on established quality. For Sessegnon, it is an opportunity that must be seized. \u201cThe plan was to come here and play in these big games,\u201d Sessegnon says. \u201cThis would be the biggest one I\u2019ve played in.\u201d Sessegnon makes the point that it has been a long time since he started a game \u2013 it was 18 June against France\u2019s under-21s, to be precise. He suffered the injury in the next game of the tournament against Romania, feeling a sharp pain in the hamstring as he took a corner and, having missed pre-season and played a total of 64 minutes for Spurs and England\u2019s under-21s since then, it is plain that he could take a while to get up to speed. The problem is that time is not his friend. \u201cComing to the club injured wasn\u2019t easy for me and, as it was my first serious injury, it was hard to watch the boys train when all I wanted was to be involved,\u201d Sessegnon says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be out for so long. Never.\u201d When Sessegnon imagined his first start for Spurs, it was under Pochettino and he does not hide his disappointment at how things unravelled for the former manager. \u201cHe [Pochettino] was a big part of me coming to the club,\u201d Sessegnon says. \u201cI knew they had been watching me for a while and to finally come to the club and play under him was a dream come true. Then, for him to go suddenly after not working with him at all was disappointing. It\u2019s part of the game and I\u2019m just trying to work and improve under the new manager.\u201d Mourinho had a quip for those who criticise him for not trusting in youth. \u201cScott McTominay is only the best player at Manchester United, Rafael Varane is one of the best players in the world \u2013 it\u2019s a fair criticism, yeah,\u201d he said, with a nod towards two of the youngsters that have thrived under him at previous clubs. Mourinho tried three times to take Sessegnon to United \u2013 the most recent was in the summer of 2018 \u2013 and now he wants the softly spoken Londoner, whom he sees at the moment more as a left-winger than a left-back, to come out of his shell. \u201cI think he wants me to show a bit more personality, show that I will fight for my place,\u201d Sessegnon says. \u201cI definitely need to be more vociferous.\u201d Bayern Munich (4-1-4-1, probable): Neuer; Pavard, Boateng, Alaba, A Davies; Kimmich; Gnabry, M\u00fcller, Goretzka, Coman; Lewandowski Tottenham (4-2-3-1, probable): Gazzaniga; Walker-Peters, Foyth, Alderweireld, Rose; Dier, Sissoko; Lo Celso, Eriksen, Sessegnon; Lucas"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
