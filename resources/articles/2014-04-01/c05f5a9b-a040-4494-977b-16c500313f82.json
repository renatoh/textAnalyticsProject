The celebration is a reminder of two things. First, Sir Neville's stamina. To be still attending concerts at 90 would be pretty good going. To be conducting them is truly remarkable. Yet Sir Neville conducted his birthday concert at the start of the month to sparkling reviews, has another London date in May, and follows that with three more in Germany. Even in a profession where longevity is not unknown, this is quite something. Second, Classic FM's tribute is a reminder that Sir Neville has made a humongous number of recordings, mostly with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields which he founded in 1958. By some estimates, indeed, Sir Neville has sold more classical recordings than any other musician ever. The man is simply a legend \u2013 and happily very much a living one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
