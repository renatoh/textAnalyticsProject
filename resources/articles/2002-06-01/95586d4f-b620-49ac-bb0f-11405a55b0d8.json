Pubs, bookmakers, supermarkets, sportswear manufacturers and providers of corporate hospitality are the biggest beneficiaries of a spending boom sparked by England's and Ireland's presence in the finals. Over \u00a3100m of alcohol will be drunk, up to \u00a3200m wagered on matches and millions more spent on replica shirts, flags and other memorabilia. The 20,000 pubs opening earlier than usual today for England's first game against Sweden will be rewarded with an extra \u00a320m to \u00a330m in drink and food sales, as up to four million people crowd in to see if Sven-Goran Eriksson's England team can defeat his home country. Although sales of alcoholic drinks are expected to start off slowly because of the 10.30am kickoff, with most initially preferring tea and fruit juice to beer, British pubs' usual daily sale of 18m pints of beer is set to rise to 21m, also fuelled by jubilee festivities. Pub tills will be ringing even more loudly this Friday lunchtime during England's showdown with old rivals Argentina. Some 35,000 bars will show the match on large screens and televisions, and most will be packed for the 12.30 kickoff. Up to 6m fans are expected to consume around 25m pints in pubs during and after the game, increasing average daily pub earnings from \u00a354m to \u00a375m to \u00a385m. Publicans, aware that many fans have taken the afternoon off work, hope most will stay around to either celebrate or commiserate after England's attempt to gain revenge for losing to Argentina in the last World Cup, boosting profits further. 'All the extra spending the World Cup is already generating will help offset the effects of the absenteeism and inefficiency at work which will accompany England's three games,' said Richard Greenwood of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economics think-tank. The Centre believes lost output caused by workers watching matches, officially or unofficially, will cost Britain about \u00a31.3 billion. 'However, there will be around \u00a3500m extra spending and consumption, which will help reduce the loss,' said Greenwood. 'Volumes of trading in the City will be significantly lower while the England games are on, but many of those traders who would normally be doing deals will be placing bets on the outcome using their computer. That sort of increased spending will help to counterbalance the loss of productivity.' Bookies believe millions of people in the UK will stake around \u00a3200m on events in Japan and Korea - far more than at any previous World Cup. The big increase is due to the easy availability of internet betting, which is increasingly popular, especially among women. England's new red 'away' shirt has become the most popular piece of World Cup merchandise. Some shops have run out of supplies of the \u00a335 top which, uniquely, is reversible and can be worn with either side up. Sportswear firm Umbro, which makes the shirt, admits it has been unable to cope with demand. 'Demand for anything with an England badge on it is huge, such as mugs and footballs,' said Colin Russell of JJB Sports, which has 450 shops across the UK. 'But it's the England away shirt that has really captured fans' imaginations. Demand is going through the roof. They like the fact that it's red with the three lions on one side but blue with the St George's Cross on the other.' Corporate hospitality specialists will make several million pounds from better off fans paying up to \u00a3200-a-head to attend World Cup champagne breakfasts and lunches in hotels and at football grounds. 'Companies offering packages like that will benefit enormously because there's a big market for that', said Brigid Simmonds of Business in Sport and Leisure. Supermarkets are already benefiting from fans who are stocking up to watch games at home. Asda has ordered two million extra eggs, 237,000 kg more bacon and 166,000 kg extra sausages to satisfy demand and has seen beer sales rise by 35 per cent in the past week. Sales of widescreen and portable televisions have jumped. Comet sold three times as many larger TV sets in the past month than it did in the same period last year. Communications operators are also expecting extra profits from millions of people ringing, text messaging and emailing each other to discuss the action in the Far East. If England reach the competition's latter stages that will be accompanied by an unprecedented flurry of electronic footie chat. Any World Cup-watcher tempted to have freshly-baked pizza rather than something traditional for breakfast is in luck. Domino's are doing special World Cup breakfast pizza deliveries, while some Pizza Hut takeways, which usually do not open until late afternoon, are firing their ovens in the mornings. 'We expect to sell more pizzas than usual during the World Cup, but think the real extra demand will be in the evenings when people are at home watching highlights programmes,' said Pizza Hut. Economists predict one other World Cup-related economic boost - wives and girlfriends uninterested in the games indulging in 'comfort spending' to escape the football mania. 'That sector is impossible to quantify, but we expect it to be significant,' said the Royal Bank of Scotland. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
