But \u201cone thing I have not been missing is Donald Trump\u201d, Colbert said from his home on Tuesday night. \u201cAnd yet, he persists.\u201d The Late Show host joked about the president\u2019s latest press conference, in which he lashed out at a Fox News reporter for asking about continued shortages in testing and denied a critical report from the inspector general. But he broke when he got to a clip of Trump calling ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl a \u201cthird-rate reporter\u201d who will \u201cnever make it\u201d after Karl asked about the inspector general\u2019s report. \u201cWhat is wrong with him?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cLook, for the record, this inspector general started under Bill Clinton, served for eight years for George W Bush, eight years for Barack Obama.\u201d Colbert cut himself off \u2013 \u201cYou know what? Who gives a shit? \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t understand that no one cares about these hissy fits any more,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll of the drama no longer plays to the camera, sir, not even to your own supporters. Because it doesn\u2019t matter who you voted for \u2013 everyone just wants to know the truth, because that\u2019s how you stay alive. So grow up and do your damn job! We have to. You should, too.\u201d Colbert took a deep breath and paused. \u201cIs it still Tuesday?\u201d In other news, Trump also disclosed a phone call with the former vice-president Joe Biden, which he called a \u201cperfectly friendly conversation\u201d. \u201cYes, it was a perfectly friendly conversation,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cJoe Biden offered advice on how to deal with the pandemic, and Trump asked Biden if he had any dirt on Joe Biden.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also decried Trump\u2019s fact-free briefings, including his insistence that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat coronavirus (doctors say there is no evidence for this, and taking the drug can have lethal side effects). \u201cWell now it turns out Trump\u2019s inexplicable passion for this drug might be a bit more explicable,\u201d said Kimmel, because \u201cturns out, he has a financial stake in the company that makes the drug. Of course he does. Do we really think he went out of his way to learn how to say hydroxychloroquine for no reason?\u201d Profiting from this unproven treatment \u201cwould be like if he tried to host the G7 summit at one of his own resorts\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cOh, he did that? Never mind.\u201d As for the lashings of White House journalists such as ABC\u2019s Karl, Kimmel suggested the press crew band together. \u201cOne day, all the reporters should get together and agree to only ask Trump nice questions, just to be dicks,\u201d he said. \u201cOne after the other, they should get up and go: \u2018Mr President, why was your bold leadership so perfect and effective?\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t that be the best?\u201d Trevor Noah And on the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah turned to the biggest non-corona story of the week: voting, which \u201chas gone from being a boring civic duty to a recipe for disaster\u201d, he said. \u201cCrowds of people packed in a tight space together, sharing pens, elderly poll workers \u2013 it\u2019s a coronavirus all-you-can-eat buffet.\u201d Because of those risks, many states have decided to postpone their primary elections until later this year \u2013 except Wisconsin. The state held its primary election on Tuesday as scheduled, \u201cwhich, as you can imagine, is a big problem, because not only were Wisconsinites forced to choose between their health and civic duty, but thanks to so many poll workers dropping out, the number of voting sites was slashed across the state\u201d, Noah explained. That was especially true in urban areas \u2013 the number of polling stations in Milwaukee dropped from 180 to just five. \u201cFive polling sites for a city of 600,000 people. And I\u2019m sorry guys, those numbers just don\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Noah, struggling to do the math. \u201cThe point is: it\u2019s unfair to the voters.\u201d The meltdown left people waiting for hours to vote in lines snaking around the city, which is \u201cridiculous\u201d, said Noah. \u201cThere are only two reasons people should be waiting in line for hours around a block: either Baby Yoda is doing a meet-and-greet, or you\u2019re buying a pair of sneakers that are too nice to ever wear.\u201d The obvious question, Noah continued, is why didn\u2019t Wisconsin delay its election like every other state? The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, tried to extend mail-in voting, but the Republican legislature and supreme court blocked him, for reasons that some Republicans have made shockingly clear. Expanding voting would mean \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d, Trump said on a phone call with Fox News last month. Georgia\u2019s speaker of the house said that driving up voter turnout would be \u201cdevastating to Republicans\u201d. \u201cThis is insane, man \u2013 these Republicans are afraid that if more people get access to voting, they\u2019re going to lose elections,\u201d said Noah. \u201cSo instead of just coming up with policies that are more popular, they\u2019d rather just make it harder to vote. Basically, these Republicans believe in the free market for everything except themselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
