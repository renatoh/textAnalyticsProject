When it comes to child protection, we have the same problems as schools in that it takes 18 months for Ofsted to vet staff. In the meantime, we have no choice but to rely on our instincts and hope for the best, as there is a serious lack of available staff. This is, of course, due to playwork's poor salary and low profile; not unrelated issues. (Searching Society Guardian's website revealed only a two-year old report on staff recruitment in Scotland, a reflection of this low profile.) I agree with Polly Toynbee who states that there should be children's centres across the country. An average 10-year-old has 35% of his or her time \"free\". Much research points to the fact that play is not a luxury for children; it is a biological necessity: children whose play opportunities are limited do not develop physical, emotional and social skills which they will need to call upon in the rest of their lives. If you have never fallen eight feet out of a tree, how do you know for sure whether it will hurt? Where do children go to play in a contemporary society which builds on every scrap of available land? Adventure playgrounds provide a safe, supervised environment and playworkers provide opportunities for children to fulfil their developmental needs. But without recognition for playwork and child care in general, I fear we'll be unable to recruit the staff to embark upon the vital project of establishing children's centres nationwide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
