Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres will miss this afternoon's game at the Stadium of Light with groin problems collected on duty with England and Spain respectively. It will be the first time Liverpool have started a Premier League game without both their leading lights since beating Manchester United at Anfield on 13 September last year. They are accompanied on the sidelines by Sotirios Kyrgiakos, who damaged knee ligaments playing for Greece, while Javier Mascherano and Emiliano Ins\u00faa joined the squad in Sunderland only last night having travelled from Argentina. Lucas Leiva, who played for Brazil in midweek, arrived back on Merseyside yesterday morning. Ben\u00edtez refused to blame the Football Association for losing Gerrard, after the Liverpool captain elected to stay with the England squad on their return from Ukraine on Sunday despite injuring his groin the previous night. \"He's injured. I cannot play him. That's it,\" he said on the midfielder's situation. The Liverpool manager was similarly circumspect over Torres, although it is Spain, who played the striker against Armenia last Saturday after he first reported an adductor injury, with whom he appears more aggrieved. \"I have my opinion but I prefer to think about Sunderland because it's the only thing I can do now,\" Ben\u00edtez added. \"They have more or less the same problem with the adductor of the groin. It's not a serious injury but it's too early for them. It's not a question of being able to risk them. They cannot play. I think they will be OK for Tuesday [against Lyon in the Champions League] but it depends on their rate of recovery. They are very close but they still have some problems and can't play at their normal level.\" While the Liverpool manager accepts injuries are beyond his control, he is less enamoured with a football calendar that fixed World Cup qualifiers on the Wednesday before a Saturday away game and denied him one training session with his South American contingent this week. \"The federations have the control more than the clubs,\" he argued. \"We are talking about playing Saturday and Tuesday, or Wednesday and Saturday, and not to play too many games. There is a group of clubs, the G20 or the G200, I'm not sure how many there is now, and still the federations have the control. I think that should change. I have always thought this, but it's not my job to explain how.\" Today's game against Sunderland starts a demanding run for Liverpool, who, having lost at Chelsea in their previous league fixture and entertain Manchester United next weekend, can ill-afford to lose further ground. \"The first game is crucial,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"We had the experience two years ago in the Champions League where we had one point [after three games]. In the end we qualified. In football you never know. The main thing is having confidence in your team and to keep winning. Then it will be easier to talk about the week.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
