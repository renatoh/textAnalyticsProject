As MPs regroup under new leader Anthony Albanese following the 18 May election, the Labor executive has begun turning its mind to how it reviews the campaign that saw the party lose against public and polling expectations. Weatherill, a left-aligned member of the party who served as the South Australian premier from 2011 to 2018, has been named as the most likely figure to lead the \u201cwarts-and-all\u201d review of Bill Shorten\u2019s campaign. The party\u2019s Right faction has proposed that Emerson also have a key role in the evaluation of what went wrong in the party\u2019s campaign, with the former MP for Rankin to examine Labor\u2019s poor showing in Queensland. The ALP federal executive, which now has a majority of left-aligned members, with Albanese having the casting vote, will meet in Canberra next month to finalise the parameters of the review. Former Western Australian MP Gary Gray was also asked to be involved, but declined the offer. Weatherill confirmed he had been approached, and was prepared to conduct the inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m happy to serve the party in any way that they think is appropriate but it is entirely a matter for the Labor party and it\u2019s new leadership,\u201d Weatherill told Guardian Australia. Albanese, who convened the first meeting of shadow cabinet in Brisbane on Tuesday, has said the party will reset its policy agenda following the election loss after hearing the \u201cverdict of the people\u201d. \u201cWell, those of us who were in positions in the Labor party have to accept the outcome and have to accept that we made some strategic errors,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe listened to the verdict of the people. The people always get it right. There\u2019s no point complaining about what happened on the field. When you look at the scoreboard at the end of the day, we were defeated by about 77-68.\u201d Shorten, whose unpopularity has been raised as a key reason for the party\u2019s defeat, has blamed \u201cvested interests\u201d for the loss, suggesting Clive Palmer and the Murdoch press \u201cgot what they want\u201d with the election result. MPs, however, have said the party\u2019s controversial tax reform measures, particularly the winding back of franking credits, damaged the party\u2019s chances. In the aftermath of the campaign, WA Labor premier Mark McGowan criticised the federal campaign for being too ambitious. \u201cThey planted a huge target on themselves, their policies were way too grandiose, way too many, they didn\u2019t have a core theme to them,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cBecause they had so much to talk about, people couldn\u2019t latch on to a single thing, and then they allowed themselves to become the issue. \u201cIn an election campaign when you\u2019re fighting against the government, the government should be the issue, not the opposition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
