It could cut a swathe through all those time-consuming admin chores and freeing your brain up for high-level thinking and decision-making. Of course, the relationship may have broken down a little. PC rage is discovering increased popularity in the modern workplace. Swearing at your PC has always been good sport on the odd occasion, but now outbursts have started to get more frequent and more personal. The problem possibly began when we discovered - not what the pc can do, but what it can't. Customer care is based on two principles: finding out what the customer wants and giving it to them, and constantly exceeding expectations. The love affair with IT lasted only as long as it took us to learn exactly how to use it. Before that point we thought any inadequacies were down to our own stupidity. We believed that the PC was capable of anything and everything, from supplying a recipe for the perfect tarte tartin to giving us a step-by-step guide for world domination. Discovering it has its limits was sobering and a low moment in the customer care relationship. They dawdle. They crash. They deny access. They can be extremely non consumer-friendly. They are great for shopping, having a read, learning and researching. But they can make lousy time managers. Someone, somewhere, will one day compile a honest-to-goodness time log to discover whether they save or lose you time at work overall. Listening to a colleague new to email the other day, I was able to see the time-wastage aspect at source. This is a woman who would normally send three letters a week, and who would get her PA to write them. If she needed to contact someone urgently she would pick up the phone and have an immediate exchange of views. Now she is a slave to email. She is delighted to be able to send messages anywhere, any time. What she has failed to realise is that most of these are sent and received in the evening, from her home. Meaning that her work/life balance has turned very steeply in favour of the work option. Some go out as late as midnight. Some poor sod will find them on their screen first thing the next morning and then feel obliged to respond. One truly sad soul even wrote back at four minutes past midnight, on a saturday night. The secret is to review your PC work and ask the question \"why?\" a lot, as in \"why do I do this electronically?\" Does it save me time or create time? How much quicker and/or convenient is it for me to do it this way? Did I choose the electronic way or did I do it because of external nerd-pressure? Is it really easier for you to access your computer diary than a paper one? Would a letter or phone call be more appropriate than that email? How long have you spent weeping over that crashed computer and how long would it have taken had you used an alternative? PCs are great but their use needs to be seen as limited. There are things we can do that we could not without them and there are jobs that are easier using an alternative medium. If in doubt, always ask yourself the classic time-management question: Is this the best use of my time, right now?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
