His 10 chapters, written with the help of the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, form a mighty Redwood manifesto covering virtually everything: here are policies on health and safety (leave it up to employers' responsibility and common sense); pensions (deregulate their accounts); trains (privatise yet more); relaxing planning laws (let developers bribe local Nimby objectors instead of paying planning gain to councils); abandoning data protection; and saving a promised \u00a314bn by slashing and burning regulation. Forget Cameron green: instead, double the mileage of motorways and build more airport runways. This threatens to repaint not just the Cameron oak-tree logo a deeper, darker blue, but every Conservative policy. The Redwood spraygun would wipe out Cameron's family-friendly, general-wellbeing, let-the-sunshine-in pastel tints. Cameron is wisely staying away for the launch. Osborne, as ever more reckless and openly rightwing, will stand beside Redwood, welcoming the review for showing \"how we can deliver a low-tax, lower-regulation competitive economy\". What's more, Osborne yesterday told the Financial Times that he relishes the chance to \"pick a fight\" with Brussels by following the review's recommendation to withdraw unilaterally from European agreements. Osborne's enthusiasm for the Redwood manifesto suggests some nifty repositioning, should any mishap befall his leader in these difficult days. Keeping the full document secret, Redwood was offering morsels in interviews to all and sundry. When I talked to him yesterday, he confirmed that, yes, the Tories would pull out of the EU social chapter, the directive that guarantees a four-week holiday. It gives part-time workers the same rights as the rest, helping women most. He would make it easier to fire people. They would also pull out of the working time directive, which prevents workers being forced to work more than 48 hours a week. Britain's existing opt-out is already shockingly abused, allowing employers to arm-twist staff into signing away that right if they want a job. (When I recently reported on temp agencies, there was a strict no-sign, no-job system: every applicant had to sign a waiver and agree to work whatever hours any employer demanded.) But for Redwood even this opt-out is not enough. \"I believe in freedom for everyone. I'm a freedom lover,\" Redwood said. Whose freedom, I asked. But his steamroller style of speaking is like interviewing a talking hologram: he brooks few interruptions. So Redwood and Osborne are committing their party to a mortal fight with the rest of the EU over the right of employers to force people to work outrageous hours. When the Tories were in power they were taken to the European court on this and lost, so they know defiance now means a showdown leading only to the EU exit gate, where they long to go. By chance two other reports were published yesterday: one, from Incomes Data Services, showed the UK still bottom of the EU league for taking holidays. And a study of 600 British working parents found that a fifth were never home before their children were in bed, and a quarter never before 7pm, with Londoners the latest. Can Cameron stay family-friendly while promising to fight Europe on the beaches to force longer working hours? Redwood and Osborne's real purpose is to raise the lethal battle flag of a war against Europe for its own sake. Other old war cries seep between every line they speak, with the yearning for tax cuts, diminishing government and a new wave of radical privatisations. All this puts not so much blue water between the parties as a rolling Atlantic ocean of separation. The party will have lost its senses if these policies make it into the next Tory manifesto. Surely they won't stand on a platform of shorter holidays, easier sackings, riskier train rides and pensions, a free-for-all in the water industry, less health and safety, less consumer protection and no data protection in a risky internet era? But a hearty endorsement by the shadow chancellor will provide Labour with ample ammunition to show where true Tory hearts remain. Cameron should never have let Redwood out of his cage: having made that mistake, he should have ordered his whole team to keep a safe distance from his dangerous review. If this is what the Tories want, then they're done for. Cameron needs to ignore the warm welcome all this is receiving from his tormentors in the Mail and the Telegraph. He should keep his nerve and have none of it. A cool assessment will tell him he can't win in the present climate: Brown ascendant is unbeatable. Cameron's only hope is for bad news - economic meltdown, security lapse, whatever. He can't make the political weather, but he can keep him and his party electable while hoping something turns up. Until recent wobbles he has made a good stab at understanding modern times. That means knowing Redwood is deadwood, a neocon throwback from the Thatcher era. Tax and spending cuts, privatisations and savage deregulation were purgative Thatcher remedies for chronic economic decline and uncompetitiveness. We live in different and prosperous times now: present perils are to quality of life, the rupture between the rich and poor, the survival of the planet. Why would the patient swallow bitter old medicine, when the need is for quite different remedies - all requiring a stronger, not a weaker, state; stronger, not weaker, international action? Waiting is gruelling and his party may not have the patience. But there is much good Cameron can do from permanent opposition, if he chooses. He can shame the government for its inertia on the environmental crisis and outbid it in policy. He can goad it, as only Conservatives could, on the failure to tackle obscenely undertaxed hyper-wealth. He could do precisely the opposite of the Redwood review - and demand better, not worse, family and working lives. He should taunt Labour for weakness on its own ground, and defy his worst enemies in the Tory press. It would earn him admiration for bravery, expose Labour cowardice and do some good. Resist Redwoodism, and he still has a chance. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
