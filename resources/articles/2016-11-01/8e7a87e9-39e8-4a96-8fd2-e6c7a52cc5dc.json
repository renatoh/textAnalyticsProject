Liam Williams seems to be only one immune \u2013 a bundle of energy on his return on Saturday \u2013 and you have to wonder where Wales would be without him. It was his try against the disappointing Pumas, shortly after half-time, that finally gave Wales belief a run of five straight defeats could be ended, that their ears might stop ringing following their awful performance against Australia the week before. It was also Williams who carried the fight to New Zealand over the summer \u2013 always a counterattacking threat and immaculate under the high ball. \u201cHe is like a bag of spanners, isn\u2019t he? He is a great player, a player who gives 100% every time he takes the field. It is great to play with him, hopefully he will keep playing well,\u201d said his Scarlets team-mate Scott Williams, while Rob Howley was only too happy to describe him as having \u201cthe x factor\u201d in a side so devoid of it elsewhere. The problem for Wales was evident, in microcosm, in the 10 minutes before half-time. A restless crowd was stirred as Dan Biggar kept kicking to the corner, scenting Wales\u2019 superiority in the collisions would translate into the first try. The driving maul was dreadful however and despite a series of scrums and a yellow card for the Pumas tighthead, Ramiro Herrera, they could not breach the line \u2013 while for both their tries, Gareth Davies sniped over for the second, the scorers had plenty of work to do when receiving the ball. \u201cWe spoke all week about not being individual about what we are doing close to the line,\u201d said the hooker, Ken Owens, who went off with a rib and hip injury in the second half. \u201cThere was a bit of white-line fever at times and we didn\u2019t execute as well as we would have liked in that area. The top teams in the southern hemisphere convert those chances \u2013 just look at Australia last week \u2013 we still have to work on that part of our game.\u201d It was clear from the onset Wales would take on Argentina up front; add more fire and brimstone rather than fancy footwork in the backs with the returning Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones hugely influential. And while Wales could not pull away from Argentina and needed two late Leigh Halfpenny penalties to get over the line, it worked. Just. This victory \u2013 Howley\u2019s first against a southern hemisphere side in seven attempts \u2013 will not live long in the memory, although it may go some way to keeping Wales in the top eight of the world rankings when the World Cup draw is made in May; Argentina had after all just gone above their hosts. \u201cIt\u2019s about home wins. The world rankings will look after themselves. When you look at four to 10, they\u2019re going to swing, it\u2019s a cluster between four and nine but to win against a side above us in the rankings is obviously important but more important is to win at home,\u201d said Howley, no doubt relieved after dropping Jamie Roberts, Dan Lydiate and Alex Cuthbert \u2013 all Lions. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that you celebrate wins, it\u2019s against a good Argentina side. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of the leadership group, they can be very proud. We prepared really well and the players put a shift in.\u201d Wales\u2019s inability to put breathing space between themselves and Argentina was largely down to the skills of the half-backs Martin Landajo, who plunged over for the second try soon after Davies\u2019s score, and Nicolas S\u00e1nchez, who kicked 10 points. There were few glimpses of their vaunted running game that put 43 points on Ireland on their last visit to Cardiff in the World Cup quarter-finals, while the return of Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez led to a number of high kicks, few of them successful, even if he was there to finish off Argentina\u2019s first try. \u201cWe have to take a step forward after this game and analyse and start thinking about a strategy for the next games,\u201d said the coach, Daniel Hourcade, whose side face Scotland on Saturday and England a week later. \u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do against the teams of the northern hemisphere. Scotland are a solid team, a tough team with very good players and a very straight game plan, similar to Wales. We need to put our system into place.\u201d Wales Halfpenny; North, J Davies, S Williams, Liam Williams; Biggar, G Davies; Jenkins (capt; Smith, 63), Owens (Baldwin, 46), Francis, Charteris, Jones, Warburton, Tipuric, Moriarty Tries Liam Williams, G Davies.
