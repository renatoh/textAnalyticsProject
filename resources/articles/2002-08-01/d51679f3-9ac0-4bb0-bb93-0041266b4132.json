I won't be blowing a whistle, dancing to Steps, counting non-specifically like an overgrown toddler learning the first steps of maths (\"1-2-3-CHUNE!\") or pointing like an idiot at goodness knows what invisible vista. And I won't be leaving tons of party-coloured garbage for the over-worked, under-paid council workers to clean up, barely recovered as they are from wading through the excrement that the followers of Fatboy Slim left behind. Funny, it sounds so nice to outsiders that one lives in a Party Town; the reality is having to go about one's day-to-day business against a backdrop that is half open sewer, half landfill site. Local traders who spent a good part of the week following the Fatboy fiasco having the human waste sandblasted off the front of their buildings, in a wry twist on the Brighton City Of Culture 2008 bid, \"The Place To Be\", have now renamed our alleged City-By-The-Sea \"The Place To Pee\". So I am not saying that only gay people can act like thoughtless creeps. On the contrary, I am sure they caught it off of us. And not that I have anything against homosexuality as such; indeed, I tried it briefly for six months some seven years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Or indeed against gay men - the other day I realised that, boyfriend aside, every man I spend any amount of time with is in fact gay. So this evening, I will meet for cocktails with a charming Irishman from my agency and his companion. But you can rest assured that at a decent time they will go their way and I will go mine - and that at no point will I, the worse for drink, leer across the table at them and tell them that the thought of them \"doing it\" really \"gets me hot\". Fag hags! Why do they do it? What sort of broad has such a sad, sex-free, insecure existence that every man who crosses her field of vision has to be some sort of sexual possibility? What woman between the ages of 13 and 63 isn't already drowning in catcalls, mash letters and the general hypersexualisation of society? When Hovis can advertise three bread rolls with the catchline \"Fancy A Threesome?\" or a recent magazine ad for vegetarian lasagne shows a selection of veg having what can only be called a sex romp just to illustrate how well they all go together, who could argue that there wasn't enough innuendo in the world? Apart from the nice way they smell and their lovely sunglasses, the nicest part of being friends with gay men is the knowledge that they will never want to sleep with you; even shipwrecked on a desert island, they'd rather do it with a hole in the ground! Yet some women have sexualised gay men to such a degree that it is now impossible as a straight woman to go to gay nightclubs in Brighton and convince the Muscle Marys that you really aren't there to give them a handjob should they fail to cop off with Mr Wonderful by the end of the evening. The automatic assumption that we are all, at the bottom line, facilitators of each and every anonymous sexual whim removes a very real degree of intimacy and respect from the vast spectrum of sexual possibilities, not to mention ruining such places for women who really do just want to go to a grope-free environment in order to dance. You've got to hand it to men, they don't generally let themselves down like this. Why aren't there the male equivalent of fag hags? Dyke Mikes, or whatever? You can't say it's not because straight men don't fantasise about women having sex with each other - at least 50% of straight pornography is dedicated to the blatant fiction that all lesbians have three-inch nails (in real life, of course, such bedtime accessories would meet little more enthusiasm than an exclamation of \"Ouch!\", a sharp shove and a demand that you go into the bathroom and cut them down to the quick, right now), matching La Perla lingerie and a burning desire to have men watch them doing it before joining in - whereas in fact most lesbians are so modest that they don't even feel totally happy doing it when the cats are in the bedroom. That's why men spend so much time and money making up and lapping up their sad sapphic scenarios; because real lesbians - as opposed to desperate straight women who'll do anything to get a boyfriend, including snogging their girlfriend - don't want anything to do with them. Straight men have, unusually, accepted this with good grace and generally restrain themselves from hanging around lesbian clubs offering oral relief to stray sensible shoe-wearers. Is it too much to ask that straight women pay gay men the same respect? As a feminist, I invariably take the side of women, but here I reluctantly have to place the blame at the door of the hag rather than the fag. And it's such a hiding to nowhere because being a fag hag is a vicious circle; women generally start doing it because they think they can't get a boyfriend and end up genuinely not being able to get one because they've become such squealing, weeping, over-emotional disco freaks. You may well think it cool to be a Friend of Dorothy right now, girlfriend - but if you really want to spend your life with a tin man and a straw man as opposed to a real man, you just carry on hanging around the boyz toilets at Pride!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
