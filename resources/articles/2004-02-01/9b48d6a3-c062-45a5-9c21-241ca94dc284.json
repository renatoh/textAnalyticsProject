However, he has still challenged all other hopefuls to force him to change his mind in the three friendlies remaining before the tournament starts. Eriksson is keen to play his first-choice team in one of the two warm-up games at the City of Manchester stadium in early June against Iceland and Japan. And while injuries could yet intervene, the England coach has already earmarked those 11 names in his head. With Rio Ferdinand suspended, they would - almost certainly - be David James, Gary Neville, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, John Terry, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. That was the team, albeit with Owen injured and replaced by Emile Heskey, which gained the vital point in Turkey that secured England's place in the finals. \"If everyone is fit, then maybe I do know my strongest team. Almost for sure, anyway,\" revealed Eriksson. \"But I have always thought that someone else could show me that I was wrong. I am still open to be persuaded. \"In football, you always have to count that there might be some injuries. Against Portugal, it was very good to see Ledley King and Alan Smith, who did very well.\" Neither are realistically competing for starting roles, however, and it is Butt and Terry who are probably the two players most at risk over the next couple of months. Butt has not been playing regularly for Manchester United with just six starts in the past three-and-a-half months, and he rejected possible moves to Birmingham or Middlesbrough in the transfer window. Eriksson would ideally like Butt to be chosen more often by Sir Alex Ferguson, with Frank Lampard, as well as Owen Hargreaves, Kieron Dyer and Phil Neville, pushing hard to replace him in midfield. However, the England coach does not wish to put any more pressure on him or, indeed, to be seen to be interfering in internal Old Trafford affairs. After selecting Butt against Portugal, Eriksson insisted: \"You have to understand that, playing so little, it's not easy for him but he did rather well. \"As usual, he's very important for us. He takes the right positions, playing very simple and short. \"If he can go on like this, I'm happy. Then, if he plays or not for United, I've absolutely no idea and I will never have a comment about that.\" John Terry had started the previous five internationals only for a shin injury to rule him out of the friendly in Faro. Jonathan Woodgate, meanwhile, has not started a game under Eriksson for 16 months due to a procession of injuries. However Eriksson is clearly an admirer of the Newcastle centre-back and would like to give him another chance to impress against Sweden. That would leave one other central defensive place in the squad, with King having put pressure on rivals Gareth Southgate and Matthew Upson with his goalscoring display in Portugal. \"You never know. I will go to Tottenham a lot of times before the end of the season, I'm sure,\" said Eriksson. \"He is one who could persuade me. His performance was very good, I don't think he made a single mistake.\" Eriksson also confirmed that he intended to take just four strikers in his final squad as his \"idea is to take two separate teams\" and \"Dyer can play as the second striker as well\". Even though Alan Smith impressed the Swede in a late cameo role in Faro, that means he is competing with Darius Vassell - with four international goals - Jermain Defoe and James Beattie for one spot. Eriksson appears sure of his intended strike partnership, with Rooney and Owen given a full 70 minutes together in Faro on Wednesday. \"They have played together before so they know each other. They're two very good technical players so we could easily play like that,\" he added. \"Wayne Rooney should have a lot of freedom to play up front but to drop back as well to take the ball. He keeps the ball up there and things happen around him all the time. I'm very happy with him.\" Injuries could nevertheless still force Eriksson's hand, with the likes of Defoe, Glen Johnson and Scott Parker hoping for final chances to impress in Sweden, the last friendly before the squad is named on May 17 or 18. Time is fast running out for those on the fringes, with the nucleus of Eriksson's side already determined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
