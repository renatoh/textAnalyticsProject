The losses were blamed on a number of acquisitions by Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier last year. Operating profits rose to \u00a32.3 billion in 2001 compared to \u00a31.1 billion the previous year. But the media and communications group will take an exceptional charge of \u00a37.8 billion to write down goodwill to conform with US accounting rules. Vivendi, the world's second-largest media group after AOL Time Warner, has been dogged by concerns over its burgeoning debts and level of financial transparency. The company said its debt at the end of 2001 was \u00a311.8 billion. Vivendi shares are down around 25% so far this year, due in part to its ambitious acquisition strategy and fears over its complex accounts in the wake of the Enron collapse. Most recently Mr Messier has overseen the purchase of a major stake in the US satellite TV business EchoStar, and bought Barry Diller's USA Networks. The empire also includes the Hollywood studio Universal. Vivendi Universal's activities also include the Universal Music unit, pay-TV firm Canal Plus, mobile services in Europe, educational publishing and its Vivendi Environment utility services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
