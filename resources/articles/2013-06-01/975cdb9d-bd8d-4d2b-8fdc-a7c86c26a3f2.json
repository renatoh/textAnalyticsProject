It's three US Opens out of four for Europe, as Rose joins Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy in the history books. And, of course, Tony Jacklin, the last English winner of this event. Here's how it all ended at the business end of the leader board. Thanks for sticking with us for the past four days. It's been a blast. Another US Open at Merion? Yes, please! Make it happen, USGA ... +1: Rose +3: Day, Mickelson +5: Dufner, Els, Horschel, Mahan +6: Donald, Stricker +7: Matsuyama, Colsaerts, Fernandez-Castano, Fowler +8: Schwartzel +9: Westwood, Senden Rose has joined Dutra, Hogan, Trevino and Graham on a very distinguished roll of honour: players who have won US Opens at Merion. One of those men, David Graham, looks on proudly. Rose is awarded his trophy, and raises it to the skies in a very modest fashion, before planting a big smacker on the side of it. \"It wasn't lost on me that today is Fathers Day,\" he says. \"I couldn't help but look up to the heavens and think that my old dad Ken had something to do with it.\" So bittersweet that it's Fathers' Day, too. Justin's reaction at finishing his round was incredibly touching, his first thought to point to the skies to acknowledge his late father. Well, his son has just won his first major, 15 years after announcing himself as an amateur, tying for fourth place at the Open. What a journey. Mickelson smiles wanly, a thin-lipped affair. He's trying his best. But you can see his heartbreak. However, this isn't about Mickelson any more. This is Justin Rose's day. That was a superlative final round of 70. He never buckled, despite a couple of early setbacks, and he held it together over that testing closing stretch, playing 17 and 18 about as well as anyone possibly could under such immense pressure. That's England's first US Open champion since Tony Jacklin in 1970, and the country's first major since Nick Faldo beat another perennial runner-up, Greg Norman, at the 1996 Masters. Poor Phil Mickelson. From the back of the green, he can't quite tap in for his par, the ball resting to the left of the cup. He taps in for bogey, and signs for a 74, finishing at +3 alongside Jason Day. Tied for second place. Again. Second for the sixth time at the US Open! Mind you, you can start saying this sort of stuff about Day, too. That's the second time he's finished in a US Open himself! In the clubhouse, Justin Rose, so close to the 2013 US Open title, watches the television intently, chewing on his lip, trying to keep his hands on his hips, but he's fidgeting too much. Mickelson claps his wedge up the track - but the ball sails to the right of the cup. JUSTIN ROSE IS THE 2013 US OPEN CHAMPION!!! And deservedly so. Mickelson, desperation personified, opens his shoulders wide and whipcracks a lovely iron from the rough towards the green. It arrows in the right direction, but he's never going to generate enough power to reach the green from there. His ball stops a good 30 yards short of the putting surface, in the big hollow. He'll have one last Hail Mary at winning his national championship. Despite all the pressure, and the probable disappointment, Mickelson still finds time to smile at the crowd as they chant his name. A class act. Dignity personified, too. \"Can you describe what you're thinking and feeling at this moment?\" Rose is asked. He breathes in sharply, producing a long, pensive whistle. No need for words. Mickelson has been runner up in a US Open five times. Unless he does something out of this world down 18, he's going to suffer that indignity on a sixth occasion, his boyhood dream perhaps extinguished for good. There have only been 11 birdies on this hole all week - although one of them was his, in the second round. This doesn't look like it's going to happen, though, as he blooters a wild tee shot into the deep stuff down the left. Mickelson finds the heart of 17, but the ball's a good 30 feet from the cup. Uphill putt, though. But he can't make it, his ball stopping three feet short. He taps in for par, and goes to the last knowing only a birdie will be enough to earn a play-off. Mahan's race is run, though in truth it has been since that double on 15; another bogey, and he's back to +4. On 18, Rose's chip is exquisite, but stops one turn short of dropping in for birdie. So unfortunate. He taps in for a 70, and ends the tournament at +1. The knowledgable crowd at Merion raise the roof all the way up to the heavens, which is where Rose points after kissing his ball, no doubt signalling his love to his late father Ken. Once the hubbub dies down, he looks up again, and with tears in his eyes takes a deep breath. He blows hard, receives a warm hug from his friend Luke Donald, and wanders off smiling and waving modestly to the crowd. It's not over yet, of course. But the job may well be done. Mickelson can't make his birdie putt, an uncertain stab ensuring it stays high on the left. He trudges off the green with par, like his playing partner Mahan, who couldn't knock in his gettable birdie effort either. With it all about to come down, this is how we stand: +1: Rose (17) +2: Mickelson (16) +3: Day (F), Mahan (16) Rose's ball at 18 is right in the middle of the fairway. He's in Ben Hogan territory. And though the resulting shot isn't - could never be - in the same league as that famous 1-iron from 1950, what he comes up with is pretty special: a fairway wood that's arrowed straight at the pin, rolls a few inches past the cup to the right, and falls off the back of the green into the rough. Not ideal, and so unlucky, but brilliant nonetheless. Mahan's second to 16 is pin high, 20 feet from the pin, a chance for the birdie he desperately requires. But then look at this! Mickelson is in the thick stuff, but he scoops a power-wedge into the heart of the green, the ball nestling eight feet from the pin! That's not quite up there with his eagle shot on 10, but it's immense enough: not only has he escaped trouble, with a very makeable birdie putt, he might well have turned this entire US Open around! Day's putt threatens to drop, but despite a dimple peering over the edge of the cup on the left, the ball spins around the lip at the back and stays out. He'll sign for a 71, and is the clubhouse leader at +3. It looks like another near-miss in a major for this excellent young Australian, but surely a breakthrough is going to come soon. The way he battled today was majestic. Day's splash from the bunker to the left of the 18th green is stupendous, gripping six feet from the hole. It's a tricky, snaky downhill one, but he'll have a putt for par and a 70. Mickelson's tee shot at 16 is in an awful lot of rubbish down the left. Mahan splits the fairway. And up on 18, so does Rose. That's stage one of his job done, with quite a few of the pieces threatening to fall into place for the Englishman. A long, long way to go, mind, even when you're on the 72nd fairway, at the US Open. Mahan's ball wasn't dead, it wasn't dead. His bogey putt stays on the high side, to the right of the hole, and that's three putts for a double bogey. That will probably prove fatal to his hopes and dreams. Mickelson taps in for his bogey. So Rose is the sole leader again ... +1: Rose (17) +2: Day (17), Mickelson (15) +3: Mahan (15) Day batters his second shot from the rough down 18 into a bunker to the left of the green. Mahan's par putt at 15 scoots by on the right, and ain't dead yet. Mickelson's par effort down the green shaves the right side of the hole but doesn't drop. And on 17, Rose knocks a little wedge just to the left of the cup, and escapes the hole with a par. He'd have taken that back on the tee. Mickelson is on the green at 15, but with the bunker on the right jutting in the way, he has to pitch it, Sergio style. He kind of thins it, sending the ball right to the back of the green. He's struggling to save par too. Michael Kim, by the way, the 19-year-old who wowed us yesterday afternoon and so nearly grabbed a share of the lead, has ended the tournament at +10, the low amateur. That's a simply fantastic effort from the young man. Mahan will be dropping back, most likely. He scoops a little wedge over the flag, but he's a good 20 feet from the pin. Up on 17, it's a tense scene as Rose addresses his ball, but decides to back off and ask the crowd to stand still and pipe down. He takes his stance again, then sends an iron pin high - though it's just off the side of the green in thick rough. Close, though he may recall duffing a chip Sandy in Sandwich style from exactly the same position last night. Oo-er, gulp, and other Beano comic sounds of concern and existential angst. Rose can't make his par putt, the ball shaving just by the left of the hole. It's only his fourth three-putt of the week, but what a time to do it. So here's how we are now: +1: Rose (16), Mickelson (14), Mahan (14) +2: Day (17) Rose's putt up the 16th green is awful, a leaden clatter which finishes a good 12 feet behind the cup, if not more. A dropped shot here looks very likely. He looks disgusted with himself. Back on 15, Mahan can only hack into more rough up the right. Mickelson sends his wedge into the green, but it bites and spins all the way back to the front. Up on 18, Day booms a huge drive down the track, but it leaks off to the left and into the rough. That'll spell bother. Day's tee shot at 17 only finds the very front of the green. He's forced to clatter a long putt up and over the ridge, and he'll be left with a 15-footer to save his par. He makes it too! What a two-putt from miles away! He really is hanging on brilliantly here. Back on 16, Rose finds the middle of the green, but unfortunately the spin, and then the bank, takes his ball miles from the cup. That'll be one hell of a two putt from there. For the third awfully difficult hole in a row, Rose steers a careful tee shot down the track, this time at 16. This sort of behaviour is easier said than done, because on 15 Mahan pushes his tee shot into rough down the right. So does Mickelson, though not by much, and the ball bounces back onto the fairway. How crucial could that bounce prove? Rose knocks in his par putt. That shows great resilience. On 14, Mickelson punches one out from the rough at the front right of the green, but only just gets the ball on the putting surface. He'll face a tricky 15-foot par saver, though it's uphill. And he knocks it in! What a recovery! That's as good as a birdie! This is simply unbelievable golf. Meanwhile Mahan Mickelsons a gorgeous bunker shot from the right of the green to four feet, using the bank on the left of the green to allow the ball to bite and spin back. He tickles in the par putt, an escape every bit as good as Mickelson's, but one which elicits about one-tenth of the roar from the gallery. There's only one story here, as far as the Merion punters are concerned, and it's whether Lefty can finally break this 23-year-long US Open duck. E: Rose (15) +1: Mahan (14), Mickelson (14) +2: Day (16) Mickelson's making a bit of a hash of 14, hacking further up the hole into more rough. I wonder whether his race might be run here. Mahan's getting jittery, too, his second hoicked into real trouble down the left of the same hole. Day isn't far away from chipping in again, this time at 16; he should save an amazing par. Which he does. That is staunch major-championship golf! And on 15, Rose stands over his 20-foot birdie putt and tickles it down the glacial green. It's a dimple away from dropping - but doesn't, and slides five feet past. That'll be a tester. It's All Happening pt XXXVIII. Jason Day so nearly drains a long birdie putt on 15, but it horseshoes out. Then up 16 he finds trouble off the tee, then more rough up by the green. Rose guides another careful tee shot onto the fairway, this time on 15, then plays a very crisp and calm iron into the middle of the green. Mickelson pushes his tee shot at 14 into rough down the left. How will this end? I have no idea. You can't go away, though, can you? E: Rose (14) +1: Mickelson (13), Mahan (13) +2: Day (15) Mickelson is in all sorts of bother here, down a lush bank, his ball hidden away in the deepest nonsense. He opens his blade, and takes a massive batter at the ball. He knows he can't leave it in the filth, by trying to cleverly guide it near the hole. So he ensures it reaches the green. And nearly bounces all the way through. But it bites, and he'll have a 25-footer to save his par. Given the circumstances, that's a decent enough result. Lefty taking his medicine there. He putts up to a foot or so, and taps in for bogey. This hole is playing at 121 yards. It's Phil Mickelson Meltdown Time! Oh my giddy aunt. He's on the 13th, with his wedge in hand, and skelped his ball straight over the green and into thick trouble at the back. That was appalling. He's very fortunate the rough is so thick, in some ways, because that ball was one bounce from landing in the creek. He's tying for the lead now, because Rose has indeed bogeyed 14, but for how long? Not very long, unless he comes up with a Lefty Special. Which, knowing the man's unique talent, is not beyond the realms. It's an absolute tempest at Merion! Where did this come from? I blame Mac Millings (7.56pm BST) and his trousers full of seaweed. Day braves the storm down 15, and sends a very decent shot into the heart of the green, pin high but not within birdie range. Mickelson and Mahan both two putt on 12 for their pars. Mickelson's birdie effort, for a share of the lead, wasn't far away, but no matter, he'll soon have a share anyway, because Rose's bunker shot at 14 is poor - it's unclear whether he hit a small stone while making contact with the ball, or just clanked it a bit off the hosel - and unless he rakes one in, he'll be dropping a shot there. Rain is pelting down at Merion. It's stair-rod time. Oh to be in the clubhouse at +5, like Jason Dufner or Ernie Els! It's unlikely, but then, well, you never know. Rose, the leader, finds sand down the right of 14 with his second. Mickelson's approach at 12 is pin high, a fine shot, though it diced with the thick rough at the far-left corner before spinning back. He'll have a 25-footer for birdie. Mahan finds the centre of the green, playing it very safely, perhaps deciding, not together unwisely, that if he can grind something out, everyone else may eventually fall away. Rose carefully steers his 3-wood from the tee box down 14. Day finds trouble further down the hole and can't get up and down from the front of the green. He drops back to +2. \"Let it go, Scotty!\" cries my esteemed colleague Sean Ingle, via the electronic mail system. \"It's been ten years.\" I was wondering what the hell he was on about for a minute, and what I had done wrong this time, but it's my continued inability to give Ben Curtis any credit for his going-backwards-slower-than-everyone-else 2003 Open win, isn't it. Well, that's just the way it's got to be. And don't get me onto the subject of Todd Hamilton. Or Stewart [EXPLETIVE DELETED BY GUARDIAN FAMILY GOLF EDITOR] [EXPLETIVE DELETED BY GUARDIAN FAMILY GOLF EDITOR] [EXPLETIVE DELETED BY GUARDIAN FAMILY GOLF EDITOR] [EXPLETIVE DELETED BY GUARDIAN FAMILY GOLF EDITOR] Cink. Mickelson has a 15-footer for birdie on 12, though like Rose before him, he overcooks it a bit. He should knock the one coming back straight in - he's not been as recklessly bold as Rose was - and he doesn't. Par. But what about this on 13!!! Rose rattles his putt from the heart of the green straight across the dancefloor and straight into the hole! He's sole leader at -1, the only man under par at this tournament! That's a superlative putt, and he responds by shooting daggers straight into the crowd, looking for mouthy punter Mr Sausages. \"HUH???\" his eyes scream. \"IT'S IN THE HOLE NOW! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, MR SAUSAGES???\" Actually, probably not the second part, but you get the general drift. \"Get in the hole!\" someone cries as Rose clips his tee shot at 13 into the green. Rose turns angrily and shouts: \"A bit early.\" You get the impression that if the punter was anywhere near him, he'd get battered like the sausages sold in tasty Basingstoke late-night dining establishment Chick-Mex, which Rose was once spotted in as a young man purchasing spiced meat. Anyway, he's not got much of a birdie putt on, at one of the few holes where shots are getting dished out like sweeties. Rose does indeed make his birdie. That's one hell of an effort after the disappointment of the previous hole. These closing holes have the potential to host one hell of a scrap! It's looking like a four-man battle, though you know how these things never quite pan out the way you think... E: Rose (12), Mickelson (10) +1: Mahan (10), Day (13) +4: Fowler (13) +5: Dufner (F), Els (F), Horschel (13), Donald (12), Stricker (11) Thing about that Mickelson shot was, the eagle would never have happened if he hadn't thought \"to hell with it\" and aimed straight for a very tightly positioned pin. He was dicing with all sorts of danger, especially as he was coming out of rough, but executed the shot perfectly, the ball dropping over the bunker and the grassy knoll, before landing softly onto the green and rolling serenely into the hole. That was no leftfield fluke; it was a world-class shot which, the dice having been rolled, paid Mickelson a full dividend. Doesn't happen often, but if you don't buy a ticket, and you don't have the talent, you're stuck. Sheer brilliance. Fowler so nearly aces the 13th. He's the width of a ball from the thing spinning back in. He'll surely move up to +4. Day two-putts 12 for a par, then shaves the hole at 13 with a birdie effort that doesn't drop. Back on 12, Rose - who must already know how instantly costly that three putt on the previous hole became - hits his second dead. He'll surely move back to level par for this championship. This is amazing, major championship golf at its best! Could this be the pivotal moment, the shot that wins the US Open?!? Mickelson finds rough down the right of 10 with his tee shot, but powers a wedge straight at the flag. It drops a few feet in front of the flagstick, then rolls unerringly into the cup! He springs up and down with both arms in the air, a free and easy celebration, a huge weight lifted from his shoulders in an instant! Suddenly - suddenly - that eagle gives him the sole leadership of this tournament! Shot of the day, given it really counts for something, by Billy Horschel at 12, his approach fading into the green and ending two feet from the hole. He'll be back to +3, and not out of this by any means. Up on 18, Els can't knock in his par putt, and signs for a 69 to end the tournament at +5, the joint clubhouse leader alongside Jason Dufner. And on 11, Rose, who found the centre of the green, overhits his birdie putt down it, then doesn't hit his par putt coming back, the ball stopping a turn short. That's such a silly shot to give back to the field. Compare and contrast with Jason Day's mood as he left that green. Well, Day's now one of Rose's co-leaders, the load shared by Hunter Mahan. Mahan's tee shot at 9 is more considered than Mickelson's, perhaps thinking he has a wee bit more to lose, a shot ahead of his playing partner. He finds the fat portion of the green, then cosies a long putt dead, before knocking it in for par. Mickelson's 15-foot birdie effort is struck with confidence, but stays high on the left. He's been close with quite a few today, but nothing is dropping. His par putt does, at least. Up on 18, Els nearly holes his bump-and-run, but the ball skates past the hole and nearly topples off the back of the green. He'll likely drop a shot at the last. From the centre of the 18th fairway, Els catches a heavy contact and leaves his approach well short of the green. Hmm. Jason Dufner will be beginning to fidget, and pray for high winds. Back on 10, Donald taps in for his birdie while Rose takes a careful two putts for his par. He's the sole leader again: E: Rose (10) +1: Day (11), Mahan (8) +2: Mickelson (8) +4: Els (17) +5: Dufner (F), Fowler (11), Horschel (11), Stricker (9) Day pitches in from the greenside rough! He'll drop a shot, going back to +1, but what an escape that is, given his shenanigans along the hole. Back on 9, Mickelson fires a spectacular tee shot pin high, giving himself a birdie chance on a stupendously difficult par three. Day is an inch from double disaster on 11, his wedge from the drop zone nearly finding the drink again. He'll be playing five from a treacherous position in thick rough by the green. Els, +4 with only one possible disaster ahead of him, will be forgiven for getting ahead of himself. Disaster for Jason Day! His tee shot at 11 finds rough down the right, then dumps his approach into the creek running along the front of the green. Perhaps trying to be too cute in going for the pin, which is near the front, but it was well short. Back on 10, Donald - who bogeyed 8 and 9 and is now +7 - has presumably decided to go for broke. He arrows an approach straight at the pin, three feet from the cup. That'll bring him back to +6. Rose finds the middle of the green in two, not ideal on a hole begging to be birdied. And it's still not quite clicking for Lefty. He's got a 20-foot birdie effort on 8, but it ghosts past the cup, and he has to settle for par. Ernie Els, at +5 and not out of this, sends his iron into 17 to three feet. That'll take him to +4. Up on 18, Dufner can't make the big left-to-right breaker for his birdie, and settles for par, signing for a magnificent best-of-day 67. He's +5 for the tournament, the clubhouse leader. But he'll be too far back, you would have thought, unless we're about to witness the sort of carnage among the leaders not seen since Sandwich 2003, when Ben Curtis \"won\" the Open with his feet up in the locker room for two hours. Day's drive at 10 found rough down the right, but he's managed to clip his ball from the thick stuff and send it over the flag. He curls in the resulting putt from 15 feet, left to right, and the birdie takes him into a tie for the lead with Rose, who has just quietly parred 9. Zinger of the day award, meanwhile, goes to Simon McMahon: \"Seeing as it is Father's Day, I'm hoping that whoever lifts the trophy will find a Toblerone and a pair of socks inside.\" Dufner will be ruing that OB on 15. He's just guided a lovely iron into the heart of 18 from 200 yards, sending it out to the right and curling it round to the pin at the back left. The ball ends up 15 feet from the pin, and if he knocks that in for a 66, he'll have the round of the week and a clubhouse lead of +4. Which, as Monty says, may just be enough, depending on how the leaders cope with the back nine. Schwartzel is suffering one of the great US Open meltdowns. He had the sole lead early on, but he's just bogeyed 7, another short putt lamely flapped past the hole, for his fifth over-par hole in a row. Rose finds the middle of 9 with his tee shot. Meanwhile on 7, both Mahan and Mickelson find the heart of the green. E: Rose (8) +1: Mahan (6), Day (9) +2 Mickelson (6) +4: Horschel (9) Rose is in a little bit of trouble on the fringe at 8. His long birdie putt rolls eight feet past, a real tester to save par. But save it he does, just about, the ball performing a full 360 around the lip before dropping. This could be his day, you know, with things like that going for him. Donald drops another, though, unable to get up and down from a bunker. Mahan can't get up and down from the front of 6, and drops a shot, which means Rose has the lead on his own now. Day takes a careful two putts from distance on 9, and moves on. Schwartzel duffs his chip from next to the stand, then fails to get up and down from the side of the green. A double bogey, and he's back to +4, not enjoying himself at all today. Dufner, who ended up taking a triple bogey 7 at 15 after winging his drive OB, has bounced back with a long rake on the 16th; as you will already have seen, he's +5. Meanwhile Jason Day finds the heart of 9 from the tee, no mean feat, Donald has rolled in a birdie at 7 like Rose to move back in the right direction at +5, and Mickelson has gone pin high at 6, while Mahan comes up just short. Good luck in predicting this, I wouldn't have the nerve. This sort of play does it too, though! Justin Rose sends his approach at 7 right over the flag, then rattles in the birdie putt! Meanwhile up on 8, Day strokes in a birdie effort from ten feet! Meanwhile Schwartzel, from the middle of the fairway at 6, clatters his ball into the stand. Everyone's all over the shop here, in various ways. What a US Open this is turning into! E: Rose (7), Mahan (5) +1: Day (8) +2: Schwartzel (5), Mickelson (5) +3: Horschel (8) +5: Dufner (16), Kim (9), Fowler (9), Donald (7), Stricker (6) Mickelson has another... well, meltdown's unfair, this 5th hole is treacherous. But he's carded his second double bogey of the day. He can only find the back of the green with his third, sends a long curling putt to 12 feet, and misses the bogey effort. He's back to +2, and I wonder if the desire is tightening his shoulders. He's got that haunted look in his eye, especially as Mahan alongside him is parring every hole in a very calm, measured fashion. The sort of play that bags players US Opens, in fact. Donald, by contrast to Rose, has just missed a tiddler on 6 for bogey. That's a double bogey, and it's bye bye Luke. He never really recovered mentally from those short birdie misses just after the turn yesterday. He's +6. Here, I've forgotten to big up a book I was kindly sent about the US Open, arguably the tournament's definitive tome. Great Moments of the US Open, by Robert Williams and Michael Trotsel, is a coffee-table number, packed with gorgeous photos of all the legends from Harry Vardon to Rory McIlroy, through Hogan, Palmer, Nicklaus and Woods. The whole kit and caboodle. I've been snuggling up with it at night recently, the stories are outstanding. Get on it. Mickelson's not in the deep filth; he's in the hazard! But luckily not in the water. He sensibly takes his medicine and chops back out onto the fairway. Schwartzel can't rake in his long par putt, and he's +2 now after a third bogey on the spin. But up on 6, Rose rattles a 40-foot birdie putt straight across the green and into the cup! He's back to +1, and clearly not in the mood to stay on the canvas when the course gives him a belt! Colin Montgomerie takes a lot of flak in some quarters for chatting the old nonsense, but he knows from bitter experience what it takes to win a US Open. And on the Sky television service, he suggests that if someone down the field could post a score of +4, it might - the emphasis is very much on might - be enough. To illustrate how this theory might not be arrant bull, pish, tish, poppycock, nonsense and mummery, Mickelson dumps his tee shot at 5 into some triffids, while up the hole Schwartzel, in more bother, can only send his third shot into the green to 30 feet. He'll be dropping another shot unless something special happens with his putter, and you wouldn't put too much cash money on that. Mickelson rolls his eagle putt close, but he's obviously decided to make sure of the birdie, concentrating on pace over everything else. He taps in to pick up one of the shots he dropped. He's back into a share of the lead on level par with Mahan, who pars. Meanwhile on 15, after getting all the way up the leaderboard to +3, Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner wangs a drive out of bounds. Barely a flicker. Bedtime! Luke Donald is having a nightmare. Wedging three into 5, he undercooks it, and his ball rolls all the way back off the green and to the left. He gets up and down manfully, but that's a third bogey on the bounce, and he's +4 now. Panic might be on soon. Rose drops a shot there too, slipping back to +2, though his situation is still far more easily salvageable. As for Billy Horschel, he bogeyed 2, 3 and 5, but now he's just curled a left-to-right 20-footer on 6 to scramble back to +3. Donald should look at his figures on the leaderboard and take heart. What a way to bounce back, Phil Mickelson! After that gut-wrenching double, he's just split the fairway at 4, then skelped a fairway wood into the heart of the green, giving himself a 30-foot eagle putt! Mahan, incidentally, escaped well from the rough down the side of 3, using what he may or may not refer to as his \"fucking wedge\". Par. He'll certainly be using that nomenclature for the driver still, because he's stuck his drive into the deep rough down the right of 4. Stricker's equilibrium is gone; the best putter on tour has just missed a short birdie chance at 4. Schwartzel's has quickly left him, too; he's three putted his second green in a row, lipping out from four feet at 4, and dropping back to +1. Trouble for Mickelson. He blasts out of the sand, but only into the centre of 3. From where he takes three putts. That's a double bogey five, and he falls out of the lead for the first time today. Here's how they're standing: E: Schwartzel (3), Mahan (3) +1: Rose (4), Mickelson (3) +2: Day (5) +3: Dufner (13), Donald (4) Mickelson's in the bunker, meanwhile. That par-three 3rd is preposterous. Schwartzel really passed up a chance to grab an advantage over the field there. On 4, Rose takes two calm putts for birdie, and he's back on track at +1. Donald does well to get up and down from the bunker, but he's dropped another stroke and he's back to +3. Jason Day hands back the shot he picked up at 4 with a bogey at the field-destroying 5th. And up on 13, Dufner hits his wedge to five feet and rattles in the birdie putt! He started out today at +8, but after birdies at 1, 7, 10, 12 and now 13, he's +3! Wow! He wanders off with the air of a man nipping out to the shop to buy a box of matches and a bag of crisps. Mahan hits his driver into rough by the side of three, then very clearly and philosophically begins a sentence with a drawl of \"You have to hit a fuckin driver ...\" before the teeside microphones are abruptly shut down. Well, if you insist on inviting rock stars onto your course ... That creek was scene of perhaps the tournament's greatest moment this week, Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner's out-of-character fit of rage. If you remember, he dumped his ball in it, then flung his club in the drink too, before fishing it out in the calmest of styles, his pique quickly spent. Anyway, the man himself is up on 12, and has guided one of the shots of the day into the green, his ball sent to the back before it rolls back down towards the hole, four feet away. He strokes the birdie putt in, and moves to +4. Shades of the heroic (yes he was) Jean van de Velde at 4. Donald's ball is indeed in the hazard, but has stuck on the bank, on the very edge, above the water. He takes his right shoe off and clips a wedge greenwards, but he tries to be too delicate with the pin near the front of the putting surface, and dumps the ball in the bunker. A frying pan / fire transference scenario there. But if Mickelson is dicky with his putter, so too is Schwartzel, who leaves his first putt ten feet short at 3, then pulls his par putt past the hole. That's a needless bogey, and a painful one, given he'd done all the hard work in finding the appallingly difficult green with his drive. He's back to level par, and Lefty has the sole lead again. Mickelson misses that birdie putt. It's a dreadful effort, his hands twitching and turning as he hoicks the ball to the right of the hole. Par. He remains tied at the top with Schwartzel. Mahan isn't far from knocking in a birdie putt from the front of the same green, but he'll put a par down on his card. Stricker has driven into the bunker on 3, but given himself a chance of saving birdie by splashing to eight feet. But he can't make it, and he's back to +4. And mixed fortunes for the English pair on 4: Rose finds the back of the green with his second, leaving himself a medium-long putt for eagle, but Donald, who missed the fairway and laid up, sticks his third in the creek running in front of the green. Oh dear. Sure enough, Mickelson nearly holes out for eagle from the bunker, whipping a 64-degree wedge an inch by the hole and five feet past. That birdie effort will be crucial to today's narrative, because if his flat stick is even just a bit warm, Mickelson will be favourite to win. If he suffers one of his off days, his dream may die yet again. Up on 4, meanwhile, Jason Day hauls himself right into the thick of it with a 15-foot birdie putt; he's now +1, two off the lead. Things change so quickly, of course. And almost inevitably they will do. But at the moment, the force is with Charl Schwartzel. He nearly knocks in a birdie effort on 2, but is happy enough with par, to remain at -1. And then he finds the hellish 3rd green with his drive, which you won't find many more people doing today (although admittedly only three other players are awaiting their turn). Meanwhile Mickelson, back down the 2nd, batters a fairway wood into an awkward bunker to the right of the green. That'll be an awkward sand shot for Mickelson, though that's never stopped him escaping in spectacular fashion before. Rose drops a shot on the 3rd, too, unable to get up and down from the front. It's not been a particularly confident start from the English pair. Mind you, at least they haven't just suffered their highest career score on a single hole. That's the fate that's befallen Steve Stricker, who walks off the 2nd green with a triple-bogey 8 after winging that ball out of play. What a time to do it. And the last player you'd have picked to suffer a mini-meltdown, too. He's +3. Donald is behind a large bush, and is able to lob over it and into the heart of the green. He'll probably need two putts for bogey, but can consider himself lucky his ball didn't go under the bush. For that, he's got to thank an unfortunate young lady who was clattered upside the head by Donald's Titelist, and is looking very ginger on her feet at the moment. She's led away by some kindly stewards for medical attention, but Dr Murray, assessing the patient from across an ocean, reckons her noggin will be OK, if a bit sore. Donald misses his putt and drops back to +2. Donald, taking his driver on the long par 3, hooks one way to the left. He might be in a bush, he might be in trees, he might be in the bunker. The latter being preferable, obviously. Rose, meanwhile, plonks his short right into rough. This is an astonishingly difficult hole today, with the wind in their faces. Par will feel like birdie, especially if you can scramble one, like Rickie Fowler recently did. Here's what the pressure of the US Open can do: the dependable Steve Stricker has just winged a huge drive out of bounds on 2. Down the hole, Rose and Donald have both scrambled pars, which might give them succour, limiting damage worth just as much as making birdies, if not more. And back on 1, Mickelson nearly drains a long birdie putt, but will settle for his par, especially after that risible tee shot. A brilliant putt on 3 from Fowler, who scrambles his par with a saver from 12 feet. He remains at +4, but can't really afford many more mistakes. He needs a repeat of yesterday, when he shot 67, rather than Wednesday, when he shot a 76 that he will, in all honesty, probably look back on later with grim resignation. Mickelson powers out his second to the heart of the green. Providing he gets down in two, that nervous tee shot might, paradoxically, do him some good; showing he's in the frame of mind to save par might get rid of quite a few jitters. Schwartzel gets away with one on the 1st green. From a short distance, he prods at his birdie putt in a very uncertain fashion, and it stops on the lip on the right. Luckily for the South African, the ball thinks about dropping for a while, then teeters in. Birdie, after a fashion, and one that gives him a share of the lead at -1! Who knows, he could have it on his own in a few minutes, with Mickelson already facing questions back down the hole. Lefty's on the tee! His playing partner Hunter Mahan is away first, straight down the fairway, and then Mickelson pulls an awful iron into the thick rough down the right. That wasn't much of a surprise, because he was hanging around on the tee for ages with a very nervous, twitchy look plastered across his boat. A fine start for Schwartzel, who lifts his wedge into 1 to six feet. A great birdie chance. Stricker is playing the hole in the Donald-Rose style. Up on the very long par-three 3rd, Fowler drives (!) into the bunker and can't get close with his chip. He's up against it again, his challenge in danger of going south early doors. Billy Horschel has a reputation for letting huge rushes of blood affect his noggin. And here's an example. He chips close at 2 and looks to have saved par. But he pushes his four-foot putt to the right of the hole, makes an ostentatious and highly theatrical show of raising an eyebrow, pointing, and shouting a surprised \"It went that way?!?!\" at his caddie, then so nearly misses the bogey putt from two feet after rushing like a maniac. Simmer down! Elsewhere, Matt Kuchar comes mighty close to spinning a sand wedge into the hole at the tiny 13th, but his ball comes back just to the right of the cup. And Stenson dribbles in a very missable par putt on 4 to remain at +4. That's the sort of thing you can build a round on. Henrik? Unexciting pars for Donald and Rose at 1. Now it's Horschel's time to follow Fowler along the path of trouble down 2; he is forced to lay up, then finds greenside rough with his approach. He's scrambled well on the few occasions he's had to, though, so par is far from pie in the sky. Back on 1, Steve Stricker and Charl Schwartzel get their rounds under way. No drama. Fowler can't make his par; he's back to +4. Meanwhile Ernie Els' fine start has gone totally to pot: he followed his birdie-birdie opening with bogey at 3, and then a double at 5. He's back to +7, and of course we were stupid to dream, but we couldn't really help ourselves. Fowler is in a spot of bother down 2, having driven into rough, chipped out, and found more rough down the left with his long wood towards the green. He bumps a chip out to 15 feet, and gives himself at least a chance of par. Back down the hole, Horschel finds the rough from the tee. There goes birdie! And on 1, Rose and Donald both find the centre of the green, with half-chances for birdie, but conservatism won out there. Two putts for Stenson at 2, and he gets his reward for that magnificent long wood into the green. He's +4 after that birdie. Day two-putts at 1 in the sensible fashion from distance, while Horschel has a rush of blood with his birdie attempt, sending the ball hysterically skidding past the hole, but knocks it in coming back. Back down on the tee, the English pair of Rose and Donald are out, and they get going without fuss. A very decent approach by Horschel at 1, just past the pin, a 12-foot birdie chance. Day plays it more conservatively, finding the heart of the green. On 2, Stenson, having opened with a par, fires his second over the flag lobster pot to give himself a long eagle putt back down the green. \"Based on the fact that Merion got the same storm on Thursday that we here in South Carolina got on Wednesday, I think it is scientific to assume that the Philadelphia area's weather is always the same as ours, just one day later,\" writes Mac Millings. \"It was lovely here yesterday,\" he concludes, tapping the bottom of a thermometer, measuring the thickness of a pig spleen, and pulling a length of seaweed out of his pants. Rickie Fowler, playing with Kim, had found the heart of the 1st green, but he can't knock his long birdie effort in. Kim really should put his away, but he has a rush of blood and races it past the hole. He does very well indeed to take a breath, calm himself, and rattle in the par return. Both young men take their leave of the green. Back up on the tee, Day whips an iron straight down the track, while the eight-legged Billy Horschel follows him with a hybrid. Great thing about Rory McIlroy is, he always plays this game with a smile on his face. That's what's splattered all over his grid as he walks off 7, having drained a lovely putt into the cup for birdie from the fringe. He's +9 now. Back on the 1st tee, the amateur Michael Kim is out, and he's clattered his drive down the centre of the fairway, with the 1981 champion David Graham looking on. And then he scoops his approach pin high, giving himself a 12-foot birdie chance! What a nice moment for the young man, and what a start! So anyway, as to whether there are scores on offer out here or not, the answer would appear to be a resounding YES. That information's been kindly supplied by the Japanese prodigy Hideki Matsuyama, who has just birdied 10, 11 and now 12, the last two holes long-distance rakes. He's -4 for his round now, and +6 for the tournament. He allows himself a modest smile as he saunters off the green, then enjoys a congratulatory fistpump with his playing partner Scott Langley. A few tales to be told today, then, all things going well. The 2006 champ Geoff Ogilvy becomes the second man to nearly follow Shawn Stefani into the cup from the tee at 17. His magnificent 5-iron is shaped a lot like Steven Alker's earlier hybrid, and like the New Zealander before him, his ball stops just short of the pin. \"It's usually about this time I start worrying about exactly how late the golf will finish, what time ill get to bed, and how grumpy I'm going to be in work tomorrow,\" writes Matt Dony. \"The answers are usually 'late', 'slightly later', and 'very'. Tonight, however, I'd be staying up to watch Spain and Uruguay anyway, so I can relax and follow the golf without any extra worry. It's days like this that make life worth living.\" Let's see if you still feel like that when the leading groups take five and a half hours again. You'll be wishing Ben Crane was around to get things moving along. Sergio's just played the 14th in seven shots, his short double-bogey putt horseshoeing out from six feet. A triple! That should put him in a good frame of mind for the next hole, which he's taken 22 shots on in three visits this week, at a cost of 10 over par. Meanwhile Ian Poulter is out, and he needs a quick start, especially after his desperate capitulation towards the end of last night's round. Sadly, he doesn't get it, finding sand at the 1st with his approach, splashing out only to 25 feet, and missing the par putt. He's back to +6, his race already run if the height he's holding his shoulders is anything to go by. The defending champion Webb Simpson has never really gathered any momentum this week, either. An opening round 71 was decent, but he's followed that up with a pair of 75s. Through 12 he was +4 for his round today, but back to back birdies at 13 and 14 seem to have cheered him up a wee bit, and he receives a warm reception from the gallery when he sinks the uphill putt on the latter hole. He's +13 for the tournament, and Curtis Strange remains the last man to hold onto this trophy, back in 1989. It's just not happened for Rory McIlroy this week. This year, I guess, but we're only halfway through majors season. He's just missed a short bogey putt on the admittedly hellish 5th, and stumbles back to +10 for the championship. He's kept fighting, but his clubs are now manufactured by Nike there isn't a spark in his game at the moment. Meanwhile on 10, Nike's other great star, Tiger Woods, tickles a gentle left-to-right slider 20 feet down the green for birdie. But he'd bogeyed 6 and 7 after that triple at 2, so this bird only brings him back to +12. It's been a depressing US Open for Nike the top two players in the world. News That Isn't Really News dept. Westwood misses his eagle putt. Oh for goodness sake. He taps in the birdie putt, then makes a show of himself by pretending there was some sort of blemish along the path of his first stroke. Nope. It was just a famous Westwoodian yip. \"Jason Day always seems to be there or thereabouts, doesn't he?\" hums Brian Cloughley, who has been perusing the leaderboard ahead of the main event, I'll be bound. \"I'm not sure if all those top fives mean that he's got a chance today or that he's from the Westwood/Monty school of majors golf.\" I'd say he was the real deal. He's only 25, for a start, and he's already got a second-place and a third-place finish at Augusta under his belt, plus another runner-up job at the US Open. And a top-ten finish at the PGA! So young and so much achieved already, I reckon he's a major winner in waiting. Plenty of time for him to develop the Westwoodian yips, I suppose, if you want to look at it from another angle. Too little, too late for Lee Westwood, who splits the fairway with his drive at 2, then wallops a fairway wood pin high, to four feet, leaving himself an almost certain eagle (if we ignore the one from barely more than a foot he missed earlier in the week). That's magnificent, though, and if he pops that away, he moves to +4 and onto our little list of people, alongside Els, which is headed Well, Stranger Things Have Happened And You Never Know. Steven Alker of New Zealand has enjoyed a rare old time today. Through the first 12 holes, he'd experienced quite a few highs and lows: four birdies, three bogeys, and two double bogeys. Four subsequent pars on the bounce suggested he'd calmed down, but on 17 he's just guided a hybrid into the heart of the green, sending his ball rolling round in a huge arc right to left, and stopping 12 inches from the hole. So nearly another hole in one! A much better effort than Stefani's too, but them's the breaks in Golf Game! So is there a score out there for someone today? Difficult to say in some respects, with none of this week's truly in-form players out and about yet. But we can only work with what we've got. The aforementioned Shawn Stefani is the only man back in the clubhouse with an under-par card today, and he needed an outrageously fortunate hole-in-one for his one-under 69. Of all the others out and about, only seven players are currently under par for their round, and only two of those by more than one shot. One is Canada's David Hearn, who has birdied 1 and 7 and is currently +8 for the championship through 10. The other is Ernie Els, who has just followed up his birdie on 1 with another at the par-5 2nd. What a start by the Big Easy! He's suddenly +4 for this tournament and ... blimey ... he couldn't, could he? Well, there's another question I have no idea how to answer, to go along with the one posed right at the start of this entry. It's been a nearly-but-not-quite week for two-time winner Ernie Els. The 1994 and 1997 champion, one of the main figures who chases Colin Montgomerie over fields of broken glass in his dreams, has hovered around the fringes of the action this week, without quite sustaining a challenge. He's started the day at +6, but he's making an early statement at the 1st, knocking in a fairly straight 20-foot par putt up the hill for an opening birdie. He's up to +5, and while winning looks beyond him, a third top-ten finish in four years might not be. Weather report: We should be fine today. We should be, though there's a slight worry that a gust blowing in from the south will bring with it some poor weather. The biblical storms of Thursday seem a long time ago now, so long may the rain and wind stay away. As they probably will. But if we didn't worry about the weather, we'd have nothing else to do in Britain, so overseas readers please indulge us. Do you like betting odds? Do you like banging on all the time about betting odds? If you do, here's how the bookies see this US Open! 9/4: Mickelson 9/2: Schwartzel 7/1: Mahan, Stricker 9/1: Rose, Donald 14/1: Day 16/1: Horschel 35/1: Fowler 125/1: Poulter 150/1: Stenson 200/1: Colsaerts, Westwood It may or may not be worth pointing out that Webb Simpson won the US Open last year from four back, so a wee punt on, say, Rickie Fowler - who shot a best-of-day 67 yesterday - wouldn't be too reckless a gamble. The last winner here, David Graham, was three back going into the final round, so there's Jason Day at 14s this time round. Me, personally, I wouldn't bother, because gambling's a mug's game: even if you win, you become the sort of person who insists on telling everyone that you won, something nobody but you wants to hear. Spend that tenner on a nice bottle of wine instead, so at the very worst the boring nonsense you'll be talking at the end of the evening will be of a more esoteric nature. Billy Horschel, who could be photographed for posterity today holding the US Open trophy, is wearing a pair of blue trousers with drawings of white octopuses all over them. \"It's a fun pair of pants,\" is his viewpoint. And who's to argue? We're a broad church here. Meanwhile here's Niall McDonald, and he's talking my language: \"Just reading your intro about Merion - struck a chord with reports of the last Open at Turnberry. Access and infrastructure challenges there as well, but the R&amp;A happy to subsidise their presence on the rota. I went to the last Open at Turnberry, and enjoyed a quite stunningly beautiful day, and the next sat in full waterproofs and gloves. Watching the worlds best battle through the stretch of holes along the shore, into the wind, is what golf is all about. There should always be a place for these quirky, natural and truly difficult courses on the major rotas.\" Preach on, brother. Quirky pants, quirky courses. Life would be an awfully boring wait for the grim reaper if we didn't constantly mix things up a bit. From Stefani to another straggler, Woods, in lieu of any meaningful action. Here's the reason he doesn't win majors these days in a nutshell: he can't hole out from six feet any more. He used to never miss. Never, ever, ever. Now it's every other green. He's just nearly raked in a 60-footer for eagle from the back of 4, then missed the birdie tiddler. A mental block? That, ladies and gentlemen, is also golf. Shawn Stefani had something approaching a full-blown golfing nervous breakdown yesterday. Through the first seven holes of his round, he registered not a single par: five bogeys, a double bogey, and a triple. He finally parred at 8, but followed that up with a bogey at 9, and another double at 10. Thirteen over after 10! He eventually carded a +15 round of 85. So it's lovely to see what's happened to him today on the par-three 17th. Sending a 4-iron onto the grass bank at the left, missing the green by a few yards, the ball took a massive kick right, onto the putting Area, and rolled 40 feet across the glacial surface, curling left to right and into the cup. Hole in one! On the tee, he makes no concessions to cool, and screams with joy at the top of his voice, bouncing up and down in the Tigger style, high-fiving his caddy, and generally acting the giddy goat. Marvellous. I'm not too sure he'll be worried that he parred the last and ended the tournament at +19. Signed for a 69 today, since you ask, a mere 16 shots improvement on yesterday. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we love and hate golf, and by extrapolation ourselves, in equal measure. Here's a stat that will thrill the 54-hole leader Phil Mickelson: he's one of only two players in the leading pack who has been able to tame Merion's lethal closing stretch from 14 on! Look at this so far this week: -1: Mickelson, Stricker +2: Schwartzel, Horschel +4: Mahan +6: Donald, Rose Poor old Luke Donald looked knackered as he came straggling home last night. The drained look on his coupon after double-bogeying the 18th was a picture, but only the sort you'd want to stare at if you're the type who slows down to rubberneck at motorway pile-ups. He looked like a little boy lost, poor lamb. Hopefully he'll have regrouped in time for a real tilt at the title today, but I wouldn't bet the farm on him having enough energy left to fight if something goes wrong at 14 or 15 today. Here's a stat that will worry the 54-hole leader Phil Mickelson: nobody heading the field at that stage has gone on to win the US Open at Merion. The size of the sample isn't huge - there have only been four Opens held here before - but not so small to be totally insignificant. Gene Sarazen was leading in 1934 but was usurped by Olin Dutra. Lloyd Mangrum was overtaken in 1950 by Ben Hogan. Jim Simons found himself passed by Lee Trevino in 1971. And George Burns saw David Graham serenely sail past him in 1981. Is it impossible to deal with the twin pressures applied by the chasing pack and this testing course, especially given Merion's lethal closing stretch from 14 on? Can Lefty buck the trend? We're about to find out. This is going to be one hell of an afternoon's golf. Tiger's taken a triple-bogey 8 on the 2nd. I think, unless he manages to out-do Sergio at some point, that's the last we'll be hearing of him today. Bye bye! He drops back to +11, a shocking performance from a player who has been in form and was hotly tipped to win this tournament at the start of the week. That's only two top-ten finishes in his last seven majors, then. Not a shameful record by anyone else's standards, but this is Tiger Woods. Something's got to give at some point. Muirfield watch out? He's not going to be relevant for too long this afternoon, so let's enjoy the man while we can. Tiger Woods, who shot an appalling 76 yesterday, at one point missing a putt from no more than 18 inches, is out on the course, and he appears to be in the mood to post a statement score, even if hopes of winning that elusive 15th major today are nothing more than a pipe dream. He's rattled in a birdie on the opening hole and ... ah, hold on, he's just winged his drive at 2 out of bounds down the right. Oh Tiger! Here we go, then, into the fourth and, unless we require an 18-hole play-off tomorrow, the final day of what has been a thoroughly charming US Open. Merion hasn't been perfect - the thick stuff right by the greens is a little bit much in the way of punishment when a ball takes one roll off the putting surface, and it's a shame only 25,000 spectators can be crammed into the tiny site each day - but the good far outweighs the petty complaints. This is one of the most picturesque, challenging, interesting, storied, varied and simply different courses in the world. And some of the criticisms of Merion have been downright ludicrous. The course has played too tough? This is the US Open, not the Bob Hope Classic. Players have to ride a shuttle between the locker room and the course? Please, it's not a hardship to sit on a golf cart for ten minutes each way. Players aren't turning up for press conferences, because the media hut is also situated in an awkward spot, making the life of journalists a nightmare? World's smallest violin alert! A furious Baba O'Riley style solo on the world's smallest violin! Perhaps the poor dears will have to think up something new to write. If these are the only reasons we're given for the US Open never returning to this gorgeous venue, modern professional sport has come to a pretty pass. Let's be honest, it's the low gate money that's the real issue. Well, this is the sort of place that makes the US Open unique, and has turned it into the famous money-spinning competition it is today. If the USGA can't take a small financial hit once every 10-15 years or so in order to further embellish the legend, if the players can't show a little bit of patience in traffic, and if the media can't be bothered to get their feet off the desk, we might as well all pack up and go home. I love Merion. -1: Mickelson E: Mahan, Schwartzel, Stricker +1: Rose, Donald, Horschel +2: Day +3: Fowler +4: Kim (a) +5: Fernandez-Castano, Stenson, Poulter, Colsaerts, Senden +6: Lingmerth, Casey, Lawrie, Westwood, Hoffman, Van Pelt, Els Selected others: Watson (+7), McIlroy (+8), Woods (+9), Scott (+10), Garcia (+11). A quick nod to Sergio, by the way, who has excelled himself even by his own standards this week. He carded a sextuple bogey 10 - 10! - at the 15th yesterday. Having taken a quadruple-bogey 8 there on Thursday, that makes him +10 for that hole alone this week. He'd be tied for third spot at the moment for the sake of two more pars.

Is the five-time US Open runner up Phil Mickelson about to win his first national championship, the prize he's fantasised about above all others, for all his natural born? He'll be banishing a few demons from his locker if he does. No1: Leading on the 16th tee at Pinehurst, he bogeyed the hole, then missed a short birdie putt at 17 to let in Payne Stewart. No2: Leading at 17, he popped his tee shot in a bunker and double bogeyed, rolling out the red carpet for Retief Goosen. No3: Tied for the lead at 13, he missed a short birdie putt on 14, three-putted for bogey on 15, and bogeyed again on 17 to finish two behind Lucas Glover. And of course, the piece de resistance, No 4: Looking to win his third major in a row at WInged Foot in 2006, he led by one on the 72nd tee, sliced a risible drive into a hospitality tent, went for the green instead of taking his medicine, and ended up with a double bogey that left him a stroke short of a play-off with eventual winner Geoff Ogilvy. If there's one meltdown that'll define him for ever if he fails to win today, it's that. But he's in good nick to right those wrongs. The only man going into the final round under par, he's navigated a beautiful but brutal Merion East very sensibly for the most part, hit more than his fair share of spectacular approaches, carded a superlative 67, a joint low for the week, and displayed admirable mental resilience, executing some jaw-dropping escapes, and salvaging both his second and third rounds when they looked to be going the shape of the pear. He's been the player of the tournament so far, a deserving leader at the 54-hole mark. This could, perhaps should, be his day. Problem is, of course, he might want it just that little bit too much. And if he crumbles under the pressure, and becomes the king of all the US Open nearly men - Sam Snead, Greg Norman, Colin Montgomerie, MacDonald Smith - there are plenty of class acts waiting to nip in ahead of him. Stick a pin in a list containing Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, Billy Horschel, Luke Donald, Justin Rose, Steve Stricker, Charl Schwartzel and Hunter Mahan, and that's without delving too far back into the field, should someone shoot a preposterously low score and set a target that might, with Merion's closing holes turning up the heat, write another US Open story for the ages. The crowds will be baying for Lefty, though, the nation's sweetheart. Though there could be another feelgood story should he fail. Should the dependable Steve Stricker make it - and he's got the putting chops required to win a US Open - he'll become the second-oldest major winner of all time, beating Jack Nicklaus at the 1986 Masters by a couple of months, but still trailing Julius Boros at the 1968 PGA by a couple of years. That'd be fantastic, too. Which reminds me, I still don't forgive Stewart Cink for winning the 2009 Open, but that's another story, and I'm not letting that dreamwrecker bring me down from the high of the final day at a major championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
