The man was shot at Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, at around 7pm on Saturday after two police officers went to the property to arrest him. \u201cDuring that time a struggle ensued and two shots were fired and he sadly passed away later,\u201d acting deputy commissioner Michael White said. He said the man lunged at a police officer as the pair attempted to arrest him. \u201cMy understanding is he was armed with a weapon,\u201d he said. White said a warrant for the man\u2019s arrest had been issued after he breached parole. After the shooting police provided first aid to the victim as there were no medical staff in the community at the time. An ambulance from a neighbouring community was called to attend the scene. Sky News reported he was taken to the local police station for two hours while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. A police officer received a shoulder wound during the incident, White said. The death is being treated as a death in custody. The body has been taken to Alice Springs and a coronial investigation will be held. Fewer than 800 people live in the Yuendumu community."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
