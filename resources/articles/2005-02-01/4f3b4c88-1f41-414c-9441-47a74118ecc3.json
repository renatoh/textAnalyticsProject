The initiative is understood to have been led by David Lipsey who wrote a study on the future funding of the BBC in 1999 with Gavyn Davies, the former BBC chairman and chief economist at Goldman Sachs. There are fears in some parts of Whitehall that the Lords select committee will be stuffed with former broadcasters who have axes to grind and will mean a three-way fight with No 10 and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport over the future of the BBC. It has also emerged today that the green paper on the future of the BBC will not be published until Wednesday at the earliest. Its publication has been delayed until the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, returns from an official trip to Egypt and South Africa on Tuesday. Officials at the DCMS say they are unable to announce the date of publication for the green paper, because they are waiting for the government's business managers to find two slots in the parliamentary business diary. Sources say that despite the intervention of Lord Birt, the green paper will propose a new 10-year licence, some changes to BBC governance, and will simply record the Lord Burns committee's radical option of setting up a public service broadcasting commission, with the power to top-slice the BBC licence fee. Originally it was expected that the green paper would in effect be a white paper (ie, the blueprint for an act), but because of the general election No 10 has decided that outlining firm policy would be to court unnecessary controversy. The aim now is to publish a white paper late in the autumn. This also gives the current BBC chairman, Michael Grade, room to demonstrate his reforms are working. There is also a belief that Lord Birt's intervention has united opinion against changes in favour of the Grade approach. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
