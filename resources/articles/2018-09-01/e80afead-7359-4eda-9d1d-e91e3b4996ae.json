I know. I\u2019m one of them. 29.53% of applicants gained access to the Disability Support Pension last financial year. The government wants you to consider this a win. But cutting access to the DSP doesn\u2019t mean those who\u2019ve been rejected are working. It means they\u2019re on Newstart, an allowance that\u2019s fundamentally unable to support those with disability or chronic illness. I have endometriosis. You might have heard of it, particularly with the recent publication of the national action plan for endometriosis. I share the condition with around 700,000 Australians but symptoms vary. Some with endo live relatively functional lives. Others, like me, have a landmine go off in our pelvis that takes our whole body down with it. In 2016 I left a job I loved because I was too sick to work. I then did what many sick people do: I sought help from Centrelink. My first Newstart claim was rejected due to a paperwork error. The 21 days spent appealing that decision foreshadowed the next 17 months of my life. If you\u2019re on Newstart while you\u2019re sick, you can get an exemption from job search responsibilities until you\u2019re well enough to look for work. It\u2019s a good system, provided you\u2019re not sick for too long. After my first doctor\u2019s certificate expired, I attended an employment-ready assessment where my medical exemption was extended while I worked with doctors to get better. Only I didn\u2019t get better. Two surgeries, a truckload of medication, and a bank-draining team of medical professionals later, I accepted my new normal. On good days I can write or even leave the house. On bad days I can\u2019t leave my bed. My really bad days are spent on the shower floor trying not to blackout. The biggest barrier to my finding regular work is I never know what kind of day I\u2019ll have in advance. And if I push myself, I risk bad days becoming bad weeks. Armed with 12 months of documentation and the support of three doctors, I applied for the DSP in August 2017. I was rejected two months later. The rejection gave no specifics but a Centrelink staffer later told me it was because I\u2019d started seeing a pain specialist and therefore my condition wasn\u2019t \u201cfully diagnosed, treated, and stabilised\u201d. I set about appealing the decision. Then my job search exemption expired. When I enquired about another, I was told I couldn\u2019t get one if my condition was unchanged, even if \u201cunchanged\u201d meant \u201cstill sick\u201d. When I asked whether I could submit a doctor\u2019s certificate, I was told Centrelink won\u2019t accept doctor\u2019s certificates for the same condition twice. \u201cNewstart isn\u2019t designed for sick people,\u201d the Centrelink staffer said. If I wasn\u2019t getting better I should apply for the DSP. I cried as I walked home. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time. I\u2019m supposed to find work for 7-15 hours a week. When I asked about the sporadic freelance work I do I was told that it didn\u2019t count. I was told that freelance and gig work \u2013 often the only work flexible enough for those with chronic illness or disability \u2013 often isn\u2019t accepted as \u201cwork\u201d by Centrelink. They will, however, record your earnings and reduce your allowance. That turned out to be wrong information. I\u2019ve since learned my freelance work does meet Centrelink\u2019s requirements to be counted as work. This is far from the first time I\u2019ve been given misinformation. I\u2019ve been sent to the wrong appointments, forced to chase documentation I didn\u2019t need, told I shouldn\u2019t bother submitting paperwork that would help my situation, and \u2013 perhaps the worst part \u2013 most of the time the misinformation is corroborated by other Centrelink staffers or their affiliates. It\u2019s exhausting. Meanwhile, my DSP appeal languished for six months before being rejected. When I called the number on the rejection letter, I had a genuinely horrific conversation. The assessor cited the fact I was on medication to suppress menstruation as evidence my condition wasn\u2019t \u201cfully treated and stabilised\u201d. Period suppression is standard practice for those with endometriosis. It\u2019s not treatment, it\u2019s maintenance. I\u2019ll be on medication to suppress menstruation so long as I have my uterus. It\u2019s a shame, the assessor continued, that my doctor won\u2019t perform a hysterectomy. I explained that hysterectomies don\u2019t cure endometriosis but my doctor is willing to perform one if I choose because I\u2019m medication resistant and have adenomyosis. Their response? Because a hysterectomy is on the cards, my condition isn\u2019t \u201cfully treated\u201d. If I appealed further and was successful, I wouldn\u2019t be \u201callowed\u201d to have a hysterectomy in the next two years. While I was reeling from this, they said unless I\u2019m \u201crunning around without knickers and hiding in bushes\u201d then my co-morbid mental illness is also not severe enough to qualify me for the DSP. They didn\u2019t try to assess the impact of my illnesses the way they affect me: cumulatively. So here I am, living on $650.67 per fortnight (after rent assistance) when my medical expenses alone start at $300 a month (post medicare safety net). I have to find 7-15 hours of work but I have to fight to have my freelancing count toward that number. I don\u2019t qualify for the DSP but Newstart \u201cisn\u2019t designed for sick people\u201d. And almost one-third of those on Newstart are in my position. The system is failing those it should be helping. But hey, at least the budget\u2019s looking good.
