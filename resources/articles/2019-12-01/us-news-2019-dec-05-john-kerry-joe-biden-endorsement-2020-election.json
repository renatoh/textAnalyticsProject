I\u2019m endorsing him because I know him so well,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cThe world is broken. Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges. \u201cAnd I believe very deeply that Joe Biden\u2019s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.\u201d Kerry specifically cited the president\u2019s performance this week at the Nato summit in London as a reason why the country needed Biden to be the Democratic presidential candidate to challenge Trump in the 2020 US election. \u201cThe petulance and smallness and ridicule that he invited is very dangerous for all of us,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAnd that just underscores the urgency of people recognizing the assets that Joe Biden brings to the table.\u201d The Biden campaign similarly criticized Trump for his performance at the Nato summit, releasing a new video featuring footage of world leaders seeming to laugh at the US president. The Biden video describes Trump as \u201ca president the world is laughing at\u201d and concludes: \u201cWe need a leader the world respects.\u201d Biden, at an event in New Hampton, Iowa, expressed embarrassment over the world reaction to the video capturing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson laughing about Trump earlier this week in London. \u201cDid you ever think you\u2019d see that?\u201d Biden asked supporters. Kerry has endorsed Biden over two fellow Massachusetts Democrats running against him in the presidential primary, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who is considered a \u201ctop-tier\u201d candidate, and the former governor Deval Patrick, who made a late entry into the race this month. \u201cI like Elizabeth enormously. I worked very hard to help her win her seat. And I like Deval. I worked closely with him as governor,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cI just think Joe is the person for the moment.\u201d Biden is well ahead of his opponents in terms of major party endorsements, having already earned the backing of dozens of congressional Democrats. Kerry is expected to join him on the campaign trail in Iowa on Friday. \u201cJohn\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe knows what\u2019s at stake.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
