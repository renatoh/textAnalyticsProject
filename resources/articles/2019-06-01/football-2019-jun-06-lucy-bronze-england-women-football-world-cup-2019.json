It\u2019s all very simple, precise.\u201d Neville, with experience of having been essentially babysat at tournaments, is all too aware of the effects of feeling caged in. \u201cHe knows you can get bogged down in too much detail,\u201d says Bronze. \u201cPhil puts so much trust in us players he gets a lot of respect back.\u201d Bronze was at the last World Cup but her status has changed markedly since the start of that tournament. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knew me,\u201d she says. Now Bronze is a focal point. The 27-year-old is a two-times Champions League winner, a treble winner with Lyon, and is Neville\u2019s pick as the best female player in the world. Her stock could hardly be higher. And the World Cup in Canada was where it all began. \u201cWe were successful and I scored a couple of goals and I think my football life changed overnight,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople knew my name and who I was, and I had a target on my back when I was playing, but it was something I enjoyed and always wanted. \u201cI played with the likes of Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey and Fara Williams \u2013 all these great players. Everybody knew who they were and I was turning into one of these girls who were always my heroes.\u201d She no longer feels there is a target on her back, the load lightened at club and international level by the quality of the players around her. \u201cAt Lyon there\u2019s 20 other superstars there \u2013 I\u2019m not the best player there, I\u2019m not the best player at England,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s players who are brilliant as well, so there\u2019s shared responsibility and pressure. That\u2019s the strength in the squad right now.\u201d As the best right-back in the world and playing in arguably its best club team, she is hugely valuable to the England manager. So much so that with the absence of the injured Jordan Nobbs he has experimented with Bronze in midfield. Why? Because she embodies her second middle name, her mum\u2019s maiden name: Tough. But things could have been very different. The Berwick-born defender could have played for Scotland. \u201cPotentially there was a way I could have been eligible for Scotland \u2013 [I have] got a few relatives but never really explored it,\u201d says Bronze, who could also have played for Portugal through her father. With the semi-finals and final being played in Lyon, Bronze could well be going home soon. \u201cI speak French now but the [England] girls all laugh when I speak French,\u201d she says. Living in France has given her an insight into the expectancy there. \u201cAs an England team we do a lot of media and sponsorships and it\u2019s quite big for us, but in France I play with eight of the French team \u2013 for them it\u2019s crazy. \u201cEvery day people are coming in to talk about the World Cup, to talk to myself or the Japanese, or whoever about it, and our president at Lyon talks about it all the time. It\u2019s in the media, in the papers, most weeks.\u201d France have underperformed on the biggest stages but there is a feeling that everything is clicking for them. \u201cOne of them said to me that if they win she will retire, and she\u2019s one of the best players in the world, Amandine Henry,\u201d Bronze says. \u201cThey are absolutely buzzing, the whole country is behind them. For me, they are probably the most talented team in terms of ability. They have some of the best players in the world and a lot of them \u2013 not just one or two. They are a top team and the nation will be behind them.\u201d One of her clubmates will be missing, though. Ada Hegerberg, scorer of a hat-trick in the Champions League final and the Ballon d\u2019Or winner, has chosen not to represent Norway, a disagreement with the football federation over opportunities for girls domestically and the way the team play at the heart of her bold decision. \u201cShe\u2019s set in her ways about what she wants to do,\u201d says Bronze. \u201cThe way she speaks and the way she is, she\u2019s a trailblazer and she has a lot of strong opinions on a lot of things, not just in football. She wants to do what she thinks is right and push her country on. \u201cIt\u2019s different for me \u2013 I\u2019m in a very privileged position and the FA support us in such great ways \u2026 The way Ada is, she will change a lot of things in the game whether that\u2019s with Lyon or Norway, or with football or women\u2019s sport in general.\u201d For England the growth of the game domestically has meant even the more inexperienced players are better prepared for a tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s not just myself that went into the last tournament with a bit of the unknown,\u201d Bronze says. \u201cA lot of players were like that and in the last four years as women\u2019s football has grown, we\u2019ve grown with it, and the team has grown with it. \u201cNo one is lagging behind. They are up to speed; people aren\u2019t going to feel the pressure. Everyone is used to the cameras being in front of them \u2013 that\u2019s women\u2019s football now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
