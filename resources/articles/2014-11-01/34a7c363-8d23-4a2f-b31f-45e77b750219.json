Hodgson will announce his squad at lunchtime for the game against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday week and the friendly in Scotland three days later. Having missed the World Cup after suffering a cruciate ligament injury, Walcott has only just returned to action for Arsenal but manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is happy for the 25-year-old to link up with the national team in order to gain some match fitness. However, there are still doubts about whether Berahino will make the cut despite scoring eight goals in 13 appearances for West Brom this season to establish himself as currently the most prolific English striker in the Premier League. Hodgson is understood to have reservations about the 21-year-old and was due to have a meeting with his two assistants, Ray Lewington and Gary Neville, on Wednesday night to finalise his plans. His thinking might be swayed by the latest diagnosis on Daniel Sturridge\u2019s recovery from injury and Hodgson also has to weigh in that Rickie Lambert\u2019s inability to make a favourable impression at Liverpool meant he did not even get a place on the bench when Brendan Rodgers fielded a team largely made up of understudies in their Champions League defeat against Real Madrid. Berahino\u2019s seven Premier League goals put him behind only Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Diego Costa in the division\u2019s scoring charts and Hodgson will be under pressure to select him bearing in mind that is more than his regular quartet of Wayne Rooney, Daniel Welbeck, Lambert and Sturridge have managed between them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
