It's all good", "bodyText": "This time (sacred, worrying Booker longlisting time) last year, I was just back from a holiday in Sicily with my wife and kids. There had been such a thing as internet cafes in the little town there, but I had religiously avoided them. The day we returned home, I thought, would be time enough to catch up on the latest predictions. Since I had been fortuitously shortlisted only three years before, and my then new novel, The Secret Scripture, was the \"following\" book, I knew in my bones that I would be unlikely to be longlisted a second time. Nevertheless, ceremony is ceremony and I walked up on the day into the mountains. I was alone this time except for our two dogs. I imagined the judges eating their lunch in London, drinking their coffee, talking long and hard, coming to a decision. I was looking at the clock, then on my phone. How much coffee would they need? How much time to reach a decision? Then, as I sat there, beginning to think it was late now and no one had rung, beginning to accept that this time it wasn't to be, it suddenly occurred to me that I was too far up the Wicklow mountains for a signal. Fairly unhurried still, I headed back to the lower path (maybe quickening my step a little). Then the phone rang. I answered it: nothing. I definitely hurried the rest of the way, but at least no one could see me there in the mountains, indecorously scooting along at 53. Then the phone went again: it was Angus Cargill, my editor. The Secret Scripture was on the longlist. Great excitement in all quarters. Most of the pressure was taken off by the fact that Joseph O'Neill, another Irishman, was also on the longlist. I had read his book, Netherland, and found it new and miraculous. So a part of me (perhaps not the major part, but a part) was ready to cheer him on all the way. There is a two-month gap, though, before the shortlist announcement, wherein, as Dorothy Parker said of Katharine Hepburn said, you go through all the emotions from A to B. There is a private dreaming that is very much a thing perfected in childhood. But actually, that is part of what is invigorating about the Booker process. There is something surprisingly innocent about it. Judges become attached to books as if they were their own. They will fight for them the way we fight to give our kids the best chance in life. You never meet the judges (Wicklow writers don't, anyhow), but it is all strangely personal. Shortlist day came and I was sitting, for once, at my table, trying to work at something. The phone again and this time it's Stephen Page, the mighty CEO of Faber. As usual, there is no one in the house when you need to tell someone something urgently. There is a silence and a gap and a happiness. It is almost odd to be so happy, because a lot of literary experience is like boxing. Once you've had a few KOs against you, you tend to go quiet in the face of any possible victory. But again the Booker seems to brush all that aside. You're a Blakean kid again, with all your experience perhaps, but something else again. There is a tincture of newness, new territory, impossible good luck, a little touch of Vegas in the Wicklow rain. I didn't win, of course, and for the second time. The Guild Hall and all of literary London gathered. The bookies had made me favourite. I remembered vividly Julian Barnes's table the year before when the winner was announced. He had been favourite then and I suppose there is always a special sting in losing after that. All I could say at the end when admirable Aravind Adiga came out victorious was \"sorry\" to Stephen Page. What else can you say? Kazuo Ishiguro came up immediately and spoke to me for about calm and kind \u2013 as you'd have to be with a defeated boxer, I suspect. I was speechless. I had gone from the unexpected happiness in the Wicklow mountains to the Guild Hall and it was hard there for a little while. But then it wasn't so bad. There were four other wondrous writers experiencing the same thing. I robbed courage from them. My wife was ashen, my editor was staring forward, my agent, whom nothing upsets, was upset. I began to comfort him, like the brother he is: \"It's all right.\" As Bob Dylan sings on his new album (though I think the song carries a bit of irony): \"It's all good.\" And it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
