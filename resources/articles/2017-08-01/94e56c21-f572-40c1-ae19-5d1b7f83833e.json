Claude Taylor tweeted fake details of criminal inquiries into Trump that were invented by a source whose claim to work for the New York attorney general was not checked, according to emails seen by the Guardian. The allegations were endorsed as authentic and retweeted by his co-writer Louise Mensch. The source\u2019s false tips included an allegation, which has been aggressively circulated by Mensch and Taylor, that Trump\u2019s inactive fashion model agency is under investigation by New York authorities for possible sex trafficking. The hoaxer, who fed the information to Taylor by email, said she acted out of frustration over the \u201cdissemination of fake news\u201d by Taylor and Mensch. Their false stories about Trump have included a claim that he was already being replaced as president by Senator Orrin Hatch in a process kept secret from the American public. \u201cTaylor asked no questions to verify my identity, did no vetting whatsoever, sought no confirmation from a second source \u2013 but instead asked leading questions to support his various theories, asking me to verify them,\u201d the source said in an email. After being approached for comment by the Guardian on Monday, Taylor posted what he described as a \u201cmea culpa\u201d on Twitter. \u201cAs a \u2018citizen journalist\u2019 I acknowledge my error and do apologize,\u201d he wrote. Mensch denied using the bogus information and said her allegations about Trump\u2019s model agency came from her own sources. Asked why she had retweeted Taylor\u2019s false posts, Mensch said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can vet anybody else\u2019s sources.\u201d The source falsely claimed to be an official named \u201cCaitlin\u201d in the office of Eric Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general. She shared details of her hoax on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from followers of Taylor and Mensch. The Guardian verified her true identity and confirmed that she is not named Caitlin and does not work for Schneiderman. In his emails, Taylor pushed the source for sensational material. Three days after she first contacted him, Taylor asked her: \u201cIs there anything you have heard that\u2019s really going to shock people? An \u2018Oh my god!\u2019 sort of thing?\u201d In another message, Taylor conceded that he may have been \u201cgoing farther than I should\u201d by posting tweets that exaggerated the false tips she was giving him. Thousands of people have reposted the false claims tweeted by Taylor, a former staffer in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House. Mensch, a former member of parliament in the UK, retweeted at least 18 posts by Taylor that were based on the hoaxer\u2019s false information, spreading them further afield. The pair describe themselves as co-writers and have cultivated a large fanbase among some critics of Trump, many of whom identify as members of the \u201cresistance\u201d movement eager to see the president removed from office. Taylor has about 200,000 followers on Twitter while Mensch has 267,000 followers. Claiming to report things that the mainstream media will not, they have also moved to collect money from readers. Mensch\u2019s website Patribiotics accepts donations \u201cto fund more writers and research\u201d. Taylor has said he will soon establish an online fundraising campaign to protect himself from legal threats. A GoFundMe page created by supporters of Taylor has already raised more than $18,000 in his name. Their reporting has at times entered the mainstream political news agenda. During a television interview earlier this year, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts repeated unverified information about the inquiries into Trump and Russia that he had gleaned from Mensch\u2019s website. He later withdrew the comment. Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the incident highlighted the importance of using \u201clegitimate news outlets, which know to verify their sources and their facts\u201d. The bogus source first contacted Taylor by email on 20 July with an email titled \u201cNYAG investigation\u201d. Earlier that day, MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough had quoted approvingly from an online post by Taylor, describing it as \u201cone of the best tweets of the past month\u201d. Claiming to be \u201ca fan\u201d of Taylor\u2019s writing who worked in Schneiderman\u2019s organized crime task force (OCTF), the hoaxer told him his reporting on Trump had been \u201cright on the money\u201d. Taylor replied within two hours, pressing her for usable information about \u201ctangible results like indictments\u201d. He asked: \u201cAre there sealed indictments from grand juries that Schneiderman has convened?\u201d Later that day, the hoaxer replied that Trump associates were indeed facing prosecution on state charges in New York. \u201cI am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals,\u201d she wrote. Taylor posted a lightly edited version of this to Twitter two days later. He quoted a \u201cNYAG Schneiderman source\u201d as having told him: \u201cI am aware of at least one sealed indictment targeting multiple Trump Organization Principals\u201d. The post was retweeted by Mensch. In all it was retweeted and liked 8,800 times. In the same email, the source gave Taylor false details of how multiple inquiries into Trump were under way across Schneiderman\u2019s OCTF and financial crimes bureau. She said that Trump\u2019s modelling agency was under scrutiny. Taylor relayed all this without verification to his almost 200,000 followers in a pair of tweets. \u201cThere are a number of investigations being coordinated by NYAG Schneiderman office under both the Financial Crimes Bureau and the Organized Crime Task Force. According to my source one of the more intriguing ones is an inverstigation [sic] into the Trump Modeling Agency,\u201d Taylor said. After being asked by a follower for more information, Taylor claimed to know even more than the hoaxer had told him. \u201cI have few details but apparently the possibility exists that our president has been a sex trafficker,\u201d he said. Mensch then weighed in, reposting this false claim by Taylor and adding a vague allegation of her own that the full story was even worse. Taylor and Mensch also repeated an invented claim from the source that former president Bill Clinton knew of criminal wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s model agency and was preparing to testify for the prosecution. Taylor posted another series of tweets making lurid allegations about Trump\u2019s model agency that yet again matched invented claims supplied to him in emails from the hoaxer. Since Taylor posted the allegations about Trump\u2019s model agency, Mensch has pushed similar claims and pushed the hashtag \u201c#PIMPOTUS\u201d \u2013 a play on \u201cpimp\u201d and the acronym for president of the United States. Citing what she said were her own sources connected to the intelligence community, she published an article expanding on the allegations on 15 August, tagging the post with the label \u201cEric Schneiderman\u201d. Mensch had claimed to have knowledge of inquiries by Schneiderman\u2019s office before the hoaxer contacted Taylor. The source also falsely specified to Taylor that the state case was \u201cproceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute\u201d \u2013 referring to the federal Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2013 \u201cwhich is called enterprise corruption.\u201d In another tweet on 22 July, Taylor claimed that \u201cin point of fact\u201d Schneiderman\u2019s office was \u201cusing New York\u2019s \u2018Enterprise Corruption\u2019 statutes which are that State\u2019s RICO corollary\u201d in its apparent pursuit of Trump and his associates. The following day, claiming to have \u201cmore from Schneiderman source\u201d, Taylor posted a series of tweets giving details about the number of people supposedly being targeted by the inquiries. The tweets corresponded directly with more bogus information emailed to Taylor by the hoaxer earlier that day. Taylor repeatedly asked the hoaxer whether Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an ally of Trump, was implicated. The source replied on 25 July that Giuliani was \u201ccurrently a subject in the investigation involving money laundering and the Russian mob\u201d. A few hours later, Taylor tweeted to claim that he had confirmed Giuliani was \u201ca target of NYAG Trump Organization/money laundering/Russian Organized Crime investigation\u201d. He repeated several other false details provided by the source. How the allegations were based on false information --------------------------------------- Subject: Re: NYAG investigation Time: July 20, 2017 7:18 PM From: Caitlin To: Claude Taylor --------------------------------------- Hello Claude, As you probably know, the RICO case that moved to FISC started in our state. I am not privy to what is happening with the federal case but our state court case in proceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute, which is called enterprise corruption. That case is ongoing and being handled by the Financial Crimes Bureau. I am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals. OCTF is not directly involved in that case but is working on a parallel money laundering investigation involving the Russian mafia and principals in the Trump campaign/transition team as well as an investigation of the modeling agency. As you can imagine, there is substantial overlap among the parties and the timeline has been repeatedly adjusted as more targets have come to light. The enterprise corruption case has a head start on our cases but AGS will want to drop them all at the same time so we are likely looking toward the end of the year. Yours truly, Caitlin *** --------------------------------------- Subject: Re: Targets Time: July 23, 2017 9:32 AM From: Caitlin To: Claude Taylor --------------------------------------- Hello Mr Taylor, Thank you for keeping the public informed and for being discreet about my position. I can tell you that OCTF is targeting a total of 78 people right now between the two investigations we have. As you point out, more will likely be added. Currently, it is a combination of Russian mafia and bag men as well as Trump associates and family members. My understanding is the Financial Crimes Bureau currently has around 30-40 targets for the Trump Org-related case. There is overlap among the targets. Trump is personally exposed in all three of these investigations, including the money laundering. The issues that may shock the general public, though probably won\u2019t surprise you, have to do with the human trafficking case. Trump Model Management, which recently closed, has ties to Yuri Chaika and his son. We are currently exploring those ties and working with INTERPOL on that aspect of the case. I have to be discreet in how much information I can share at one time so this does not come back to me. But I can tell you now that when this case drops, some VERY high profile names will be involved, some of which are already in talks for immunity deals. I will try to tell you more when I can. Yours truly, Caitlin *** --------------------------------------- Subject: Re: Rudy Time: July 26, 2017 4:27 AM From: Claude Taylor To: Caitlin --------------------------------------- Is Rudy negotiating a plea deal?

It was a busy at the office today and I did not have time for a break. Just got off. I am working the human trafficking case so I am more knowledgeable on that but as for the money laundering, there are about 15 Russian nationals involved in that case so far. Some names will be familiar to you, Sater for one. This case is in early development but so far, we know that T kids are involved with some of the shell companies in the money laundering schemes. Fruaiduleng transactions with weird LLCs to hide where the money is coming from and where it is going. *** In a previous email on 25 July, Caitlin told Taylor that a \u201cvery prominent Democrat\u201d was implicated in the trafficking investigation. --------------------------------------- Subject: Re: Rudy Time: July 25, 2017 9:42 AM From: Claude Taylor To: Caitlin --------------------------------------- Damn. Bill Clinton. Sent from my iPhone --------------------------------------- Subject: Re: Rudy Time: 1:18 PM From: Caitlin To: Claude Taylor --------------------------------------- I cannot confirm that \u201con the record\u201d at this time. But you worked for him. You know. There may be an immunity deal but it\u201ds a political mess and very sticky. If a high profile democrat gets a deal, high profile republicans will have to get deals as well. No one is going to be happy about this when the dust settles and it may kill AG\u201ds political aspirations. But he is trying to juggle his own career goals with what he believes is the right thing to do. Personally, I have faith in him to do the right thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
