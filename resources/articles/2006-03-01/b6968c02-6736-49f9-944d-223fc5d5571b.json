They might see several clients in one day and so the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/Aids is very high\" In 2006 MSF will use Guardian readers' donations to provide information, education and counselling to these women. MSF staff will work in a specific area of Eastern Kinshasa visiting different sites every day and encouraging sex workers to visit the MSF clinic. If they come they will receive basic medical care and treatment for opportunistic infections, STIs and HIV/Aids. But getting women to come to the clinic is no easy task. In the Democratic Republic of Congo a great deal of stigma surrounds HIV/Aids. But for sex workers there is also the worry about their livelihoods. As Francoise explains, \"You have to remember that these women are often competing for the same clients. If one is known to have HIV then soon the whole sex worker population in the area will find out and they will lose all their clients.\" So many do not take the test and do not receive the treatment that can keep them alive. MSF hopes to change this. By concentrating on a specific area MSF aims to encourage behaviour change in those most at risk, such as looking after their general health, using condoms with their clients and their 'loves' (pimps) and taking regular HIV tests. Staff in DRC are already seeing a difference, with numbers attending a support group, where women can receive help and advice, have already increased from 4 to 20. Some of the sex workers have even started looking for other work so they no longer have to sell themselves. There is a long way to go. So far MSF has made only small but important steps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
