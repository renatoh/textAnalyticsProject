At first, I assumed it was based on a true story, this tale of a cleaner at a financial firm who discovers there is money to be made from the information she \u2013 as one of the army of invisibles on whom the smooth, hygienic running of the firm depends \u2013 has inadvertent access to. I assumed this because, ever since I did some temping at 18, I have been astonished it doesn\u2019t happen every day. Employers really do not see you. Many is the time I photocopied confidential documents, updated spreadsheets, logged into a computer that held a wealth of corporate secrets in order to update someone\u2019s diary or otherwise laid eyes on information that could have changed my life if only I\u2019d had the sense to know what to do with it, and the balls to try. Sam (Smith), fortunately, has both. She is a harassed! But loving! But cash-strapped! But good-hearted! But gambling app-addicted and debt-ridden! But hardworking! single mother of two girls, the elder of whom \u2013 Alice \u2013 has a chance at getting into \u201cone of the top dance schools in the country!\u201d with all the expense that will entail. She and her husband split up over her gambling and debt-accrual, plus his penchant for banging his massage therapist, and he is now seeking custody of the kids on the grounds that Sam will probably try to sell their hair for another spin on the cyber-roulette wheel. If only she could catch a break! Wait \u2013 what\u2019s this? A financier staying late at the office discussing, on the phone, an illegal transaction that he would get seven years in prison for if caught? Using the initiative that has previously seen her disguise stubborn carpet stains with permanent marker, surreptitiously replace another client\u2019s eco-cleaning liquid nonsense with proper bleach and lie convincingly to the loan shark who is bothering her, Sam scribbles down the salient points, Googles \u201cinsider trading\u201d then hightails it to the library to borrow Investing for Dummies and learn how to open an account with a broker. One corralling of a best friend (Jade Anouka) with a serendipitous inheritance and nothing \u2013 apart from, uh, that \u2013 to lose, one lodger who knows how to fix the busted listening device Sam buys on eBay to place in the air vent above the insider trader\u2019s office, and they are serendipitously away. Hurrah! By the end of the first episode, they are \u00a3250 to the good, the girls still have their hair and, more importantly, everyone has managed to keep a straight face. Maybe Alice will even get to go to one of the top dance schools in the country, if that pesky boyfriend and resentment of the compromises necessitated by her hardworking, good-hearted but debt-ridden mother\u2019s situation don\u2019t sabotage her future! There are some things money can\u2019t protect you from, I suspect. In the end, B-plots can teach you some profound emotional truths under the jazz-handsing, y\u2019know? There is not quite enough story \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of Sam staring into mirrors as she cleans them, and it takes her and Jess for ever in TV terms to do very little preparation for their sort-of heist, when it could have borne a much greater weight of fun-and-not-wholly-plausible-IRL detail, in accordance with the long-proved truism that the viewing public loves \u201chow-tos\u201d \u2013 but, overall, this is the kind of solid, well-made nonsense that is such a rare and precious joy. Indispensable to it are the actors, who throw themselves uncynically into it with their whole hearts. This is always Smith\u2019s greatest gift, and here she is surrounded by a supporting cast doing likewise. We leave Sam and Jess celebrating their ill-gotten, but morally justifiable (\u201cThey\u2019re just a bunch of rich guys getting paid to move even richer guys\u2019 money about! Why should these greedy bastards cut corners and get away with it?\u201d), gains as, back in the office, the listening device\u2019s wires start tapping on the side of the vent as the air blows through, and the trader looks up in annoyance. Tune in next week when more things will happen in a fun, but unchallenging, manner! Stocks are up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
