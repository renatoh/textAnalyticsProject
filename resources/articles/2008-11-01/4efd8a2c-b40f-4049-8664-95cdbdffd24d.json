Hardly. This was as gripping an international friendly as England have played since the 3-2 win against Argentina in the corresponding window in 2005. At least one Premier League manager had declared tonight's game in Berlin against Germany to be an unnecessary piece of clutter. The Premier League has an obsession with the notion of its own ever-spiralling importance and at times the international friendly can look a little quaint alongside it. But not tonight: this was a fascinating game in its own right \u2013 a game of two halves, one England's, one more evenly-matched \u2013 and a staging point in the building of a team. There were new faces, but it was also a match for the fringe player and the budding first choice, who all gave Fabio Capello plenty to consider. This was just his ninth match in charge. If you have an interest in the England team, it was always going to be an important night. And so it proved: England started with great thrust, particularly on the flanks. For the first 25 minutes they dominated possession, playing with unaccustomed patience. But then, even on paper this England team looked refreshingly different. It's hardly surprising. The friendly against Italy in November 2000, 97 matches ago, was the last time England sent out a team without one of David Beckham, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand or Ashley Cole. There were five left-footed outfield players in the starting eleven. Nobody was playing out of position. Here we had an England team shorn of its must-pick players and free instead to play specialists in every position. There was great balance for most of the game. Stuart Downing and Wayne Bridge linked well and Shaun Wright-Phillips and Glen Johnson presented a really mobile right flank. Together they gave Marvin Compper (a centre half at left back) an uncomfortable time. Wright-Phillips ran with the ball at his feet more convincingly than any other player on the field. This was an important match for Johnson, his first as England's first-choice right back. He slipped on the edge of his own box when confronted by the nippy Trochowski in the ninth minute. Forewarned, he got closer to his man after that. He also worked out that Trochowski always wanted to come inside on to his right foot and overall looked tight defensively. Downing also took the chance to press his suit. He was picked ahead of Ashley Young, presumably because of his natural left foot. He scurried eagerly and looked composed and incisive, notably with one powerful drive in the 45th minute. Downing is a clever, neat player. This was his best game for England. Also from the fringes, it was fascinating to see Michael Carrick back in the team, making just his 12th appearance in eight years. Up against an inexperienced duo in Jermaine Jones and Simon Rolfes, he controlled the early stages with Gareth Barry. In spells Carrick looked ideally suited to an international match away from home, keeping the ball quietly and not attempting too many high-tempo killer passes. He's not really an anchorman, but then neither is Xavi of Spain. Both keep the ball with short, accurate passing rather than looking constantly to win it back: prevention rather than cure. In the second half Carrick had to cope with Bastian Schweinsteiger, Germany's most creative player, coming infield. He stuck close to him, but at times seemed hurried as Germany upped the tempo, led by the scuttling Schweinsteiger. They pressed, but without creating too many clear chances. And then came Scott Carson's annual November nightmare. It's only a year since Carson was promoted well above his level of readiness against Croatia. Here he dithered when he might have rushed out \u2013 although Terry should have whacked the ball clear long before then \u2013 and allowed Patrick Helmes to nutmeg him and score a humiliating goal. He seems like an unlucky goalkeeper. Still, England deserved to win in the end. And this was a match that deserved to be played. A meaningful, and even thrilling, England friendly: maybe Capello can work miracles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
