Such is the state of play in the race for the job no one seems to want that an anti-Apprentice process has taken over. Despite a lucrative contract on offer, the potential applicants diminish daily without ever talking themselves up. Michael Cheika is the latest to distance himself from the vacant role. He did so emphatically and joins a growing list of men touted as potential successors to Stuart Lancaster before declaring their unavailability. Warren Gatland, Eddie Jones and Wayne Smith have already done so, as have domestic possibilities, including Jim Mallinder, Mike Ford and Rob Baxter. Perhaps some are saying one thing and thinking another, bearing in mind the RFU\u2019s insistence that no expense will be spared when recruiting an established international coach. The odds fell on Monday on Jones succeeding Lancaster, despite the former Australia and Japan coach previously saying \u201cI am wholly committed to the Stormers\u201d, while Cheika\u2019s stance was even more wholehearted than his compatriot\u2019s. The Australia coach \u2013 back in England with the Barbarians after leading his nation to the World Cup final \u2013 denied being approached by the RFU and said he was in his dream job with the Wallabies, even if talks over a contract extension have yet to start. He suggested England do not need to tear up their long-term vision and turn to a hired gun, citing the strength of numerous English coaches who could step up from club level. \u201cI know it can be cut-throat and, if the minds don\u2019t meet \u2026 \u201d said Cheika of the international game. \u201cAs the head coach, your role is to do well now but it\u2019s also to plant the seeds that someone else is going to benefit from further down the track. I know that sounds like utopia but I believe that when you work that way, plan that way, you\u2019ll get benefits in the short term as well because that\u2019s what people want to see. \u201cThey want to see you building towards something in the future as well as trying to get short-term goals \u2013 as any good business manager would be doing, trying to strike some victories in the short term but also plan long term, so that you can sit in the stands in 10 years time and think \u2018I was a part of making that happen\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m no one to be giving anyone advice. I\u2019m nobody. I just think you\u2019ve got to build something from within. You have an idea of what you want and you grow that. I\u2019m into that style. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to be the greatest solution maybe for tomorrow but you take that option, you grow it and you show this is the pathway through and this is what our next crop of coaches are going to be. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to try to do in Australia: breed the next crop of coaches, whether it\u2019s the boys who are coaching with me now, Stephen Larkham and Nathan Grey, or those guys who are going to come through next.\u201d The former South Africa coach Jake White reiterated his interest in the England job after his Montpellier side were defeated 41-18 by Harlequins at The Stoop but said he would not endure a \u201crigmarole\u201d of a recruitment process. The RFU\u2019s insistence on a candidate with international experience would appear to rule out another Englishman, with the exception of Sir Clive Woodward, and the organisation\u2019s chief executive, Ian Ritchie, said the union would be \u201cuninhibited\u201d in its search. However, Cheika, who came close to coaching Argentina before the Wallabies, does not believe money always solves the problem. He added: \u201cWell, it will help the bloke you throw money at. No, it\u2019s about getting the right person that fits that team and those people. \u201cIt really depends on the person. You see how much the Welsh love Warren Gatland and the Irish with Joe Schmidt now. I don\u2019t think it [the same nationality] is a prerequisite. There is no rule of thumb. It is how the person feels and the people running the game in the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
