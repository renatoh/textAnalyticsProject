Stan Ternent, the Burnley manager, failed with an audacious bid last week to sign Gascoigne from Everton until the end of the season, in an effort to re-ignite a team that has slipped from top to sixth in the space of three months. After successfully enticing the former Arsenal striker Ian Wright to Turf Moor two years ago, Ternent has found Gazza to be a tougher nut to crack, but, considering the ease with which they disposed of Stockport, Burnley look in good enough shape without the 34-year-old's creativity. Gareth Taylor's opener, when he made the most of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Andy Dibble and the player-manager Carlton Palmer shortly after half-time, eased Burnley's nervous tension and allowed them to go on to claim their first win in four games. Ian Cox clinched it with a 20-yard strike in the closing stages. Ternent, who has guided Burnley and Bury to promotion, believes that his players must overcome their nerves to seal a play-off spot. \"When you start to approach the finishing line, then it's only natural if people start to get a bit nervy, especially if you haven't been the course before,\" he said. \"But we have eight games left to play, five of them against teams who have similar ambitions to ourselves, so it's in our own hands.\" Stockport's fate is beyond retrieval. This defeat, their sixth in seven games, leaves them 22 points from safety with eight games to play. Palmer's team are likely to clinch relegation away to Wimbledon next Saturday. However, optimism somehow survives at Edgeley Park. The defender John Hardiker claims that the club is eagerly anticipating next season. \"I suppose you could say that our promotion campaign for next season has already started,\" he said, \"and anything we get from now until the end of this campaign is a bonus.\" Meanwhile, up towards the sharp end of the table, a Burnley victory at home to Preston next Sunday would give the Clarets an eight-point cushion on their nearest rivals and make a play-off position probable rather than possible. Man of the Match: Gareth Taylor (Burnley). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
