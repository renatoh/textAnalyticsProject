In fact, the first entirely unofficial Shorty Awards ceremony will be held in Brooklyn this evening. The Wall Street Journal says: Three techies, Greg Galant, Adam Varga and Lee Semel, started the contest last fall.

Rather than recognizing one specific tweet, the organizers broadened the contest to entire accounts. and The voting ended late last month. The winners, who will travel from as far away as Russia and Australia, will give 140-character acceptance speeches. CNN anchor Rick Sanchez will host, and celebrity tweeters, including former rapper MC Hammer, will appear. The WSJ's Elizabeth Holmes will be live-tweeting the Shorty Awards ceremony, starting at 7pm ET.
