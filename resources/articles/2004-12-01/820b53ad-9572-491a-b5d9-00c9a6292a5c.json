Although Real's president Florentino P\u00e9rez had hoped to persuade Morientes to remain at the Bernab\u00e9u, the Spanish club have privately sanctioned the 28-year-old striker's sale after conceding that he is intent on a move to find regular first-team football. The player's preference is under stood to be a transfer to Anfield, though Real will only sell him at the right price. P\u00e9rez would ideally aim to secure almost \u00a310m for the Spain striker, who has 18 months of his current contract to run, having signed an extension last summer. That fee would prove prohibitive to Liverpool and Morientes's other long-term suitors Monaco, for whom he scored nine goals in 12 Champions League appearances on loan last season. The prospect of tricky negotiations ahead has forced Ben\u00edtez to consider other options in case compromise remains elusive. The most viable alternative remains Manchester City's disaffected forward Nicolas Anelka, who would cost about \u00a36m because of City's desire to recoup as big a fee as possible, given that \u00a34m is still to be paid to Paris St-Germain for the French international. He features on a list of potential signings drawn up by Liverpool and there would be support within the club's hierarchy and dressing room for the re-signing of Anelka, not least from the captain Steven Gerrard who played alongside him during the Frenchman's six-month loan at the club from PSG two years ago. Yet Ben\u00edtez's preference remains Morientes, despite the fact that he has played for Real in the Champions League this season and would therefore be cup-tied in Uefa competition for the remainder of the campaign. The Liverpool manager has made no secret of his frustration at his side's recent profligacy in front of goal and has been severely hampered by the loss of Djibril Ciss\u00e9 for up to a year with a double fracture of his leg. Tuesday's 1-1 draw against Portsmouth left Liverpool six points off fourth place and 15 from the top. \"I think everyone knows we're still short of players,\" said the defender Jamie Carragher. \"We need a bigger squad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
