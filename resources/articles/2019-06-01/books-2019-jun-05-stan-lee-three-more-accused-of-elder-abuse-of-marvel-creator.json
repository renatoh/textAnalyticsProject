The lawsuit, filed at Los Angeles superior court on Tuesday on behalf of Joan Celia Lee, levels seven charges of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and elder abuse against Max Anderson, who served as Lee\u2019s manager for his memorabilia business and personal appearances after meeting him at the San Diego Comic Con in 2006. The suit claims Anderson conspired with one Derek Tan to create a separate company, Excelsior Collectibles, to hide \u201cvarious undisclosed profits\u201d he\u2019d made from his relationship with Lee. It also claims one of Lee\u2019s nurses, Linda Sanchez, conspired with Anderson \u201cin the removal, taking, secreting, obtaining and retention of many items\u201d from Lee\u2019s home in his final days. All three individuals are accused of elder abuse. Lee died in November, aged 95. The lawsuit against Anderson, Tan and Sanchez comes just two weeks after Lee\u2019s former business manager, Keya Morgan, was arrested on charges of elder abuse. The new action describes the details of the case as \u201cakin to those typically found in comic book plots. Unfortunately, this is real life.\u201d The lawsuit accuses Anderson of pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees for securing Lee\u2019s presence at events, despite only being promised 10-25%, while Lee himself only received a \u201ctoken appearance fee\u201d. It further alleges that Anderson made Lee sign documents and agreements that he could not understand or read due to failing eyesight, and that Lee was forced to endure \u201cmarathon\u201d signing sessions that left him unable to walk or talk. Kirk Edward Schenck, attorney for Stan Lee\u2019s estate, warned that \u201celder abuse is becoming all too common, especially against high net worth individuals who have been highly functioning professionals during very sophisticated careers.\u201d \u201cThis is not just a cautionary tale for the entertainment industry ... this problem is going to continue to proliferate as all ageing baby boomers who have accumulated large estates begin to decline mentally \u2026 often in the same time frame they lose trusted love ones who had always been their most faithful allies in issues of love, money and family loyalty.\u201d The Guardian has contacted Anderson for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
