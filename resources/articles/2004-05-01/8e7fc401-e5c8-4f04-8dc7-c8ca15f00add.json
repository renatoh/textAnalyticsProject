Redknapp is to meet today with the chairman Milan Mandaric, back from business abroad. That meeting will be further strained by Mandaric's claims last night that Smith's removal at the end of the season had been suggested not by him but by Redknapp. The manager strongly disputes that and has suggested he will quit if Smith, 63, is dismissed or a coach is brought in without his backing. However Mandaric said: \"He wants Jim out not me. Whether or not he stays is now up to Harry.\" Relations between Redknapp, who won the First Division title and promotion last season, and Mandaric have deteriorated sharply over the past week. Mandaric believes a stronger infrastructure is needed to progress and avoid becoming reliant on signings. Redknapp said: \"I don't know if the Middlesbrough game will be my last game in charge. It's going to be hard for me not to go - I feel that strongly about Jim, despite what Milan says [today]. I love being with Jim, we bounce ideas off each other and, if he goes, it'll be very difficult for me to stay.\" \"The chairman wants a new coach but I want to keep Jim. I thought we were going along nicely and it won't be easy to carry on if he goes. I would not work with a foreign coach and whoever comes in would have to have my 100% backing.\" Mandaric, who insists he has not decided to release Smith, added: \"There is a lot of frustration and some things are going in a direction I never thought they should go. First of all I'm going to sort it out and that means I will get together with Harry and Jim.\" They will meet Mandaric at 5pm today and make it clear that the removal of Smith may cause a problem. \"I've got a two-year contract and I think I've earned the two years I've got left,\" Redknapp said. \"I've done nothing wrong but, if Milan wants to shift us, he's got to make sure he sorts us out. \"I can say I'm going to walk but leave myself wide open and not get paid - we've got to get our contracts paid. \"I thought this Saturday was going to be a big celebration of our season and hopefully it still will be, but this has been a rubbish week and the darkest of my time at Portsmouth. It doesn't make any sense but things like this have been going on at this club for some years now. \"Milan's record in bringing in coaches is not good. Tony Pulis and Graham Rix were good coaches but they weren't good enough. If Milan wants to bring in a coach to work under me I've got no problem. I'm all for coaches - that's why I brought in Luther Blissett to help the strikers - but I don't see why there's any reason to break up the current staff.\" Redknapp hopes that Steve Cotterill, who has been helping Leicester, will be accepted as a compromise and that Smith and Bond will remain. The Pompey manager may also be glad to hear that Georges Leekens, the coach of the Belgian side Excelsior Mouscron, would consider the Fratton Park job only if given full control. \"I would not want to work under anyone,\" he said. Teddy Sheringham, meanwhile, hopes to find another Premiership club after being released by Portsmouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
