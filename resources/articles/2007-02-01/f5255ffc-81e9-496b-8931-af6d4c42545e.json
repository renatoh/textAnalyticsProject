I know nothing about ISAs or PEPs and care less about pensions and child Trust funds, but, somehow, the Lunch gang - from the marvellously monikered and wide-mouthed Gillian Lacey-Solymar to shiny-headed brainbox Adam Shaw - make it all seem terribly exciting. Little wonder Evan Davis looks so cock-a-hoop; he knows the erotic electricity of economics. (I draw the line at Radio 4's Money Box Live, of course.) Nick Baker's Weird Creatures 8pm, Five As jobs go, running a crocodile sanctuary probably comes with more than its fair share of occupational hazards. This hasn't deterred Romulus Whitaker (though with a name like that, likely very little does), who oversees the welfare of some 2,000 crocodiles in the wilds of India. Reaching the end of his freaky safari, Baker comes face to face with a gharial. And what a face it is. That's the gharial's, rather than Baker's. The Last Duel - Timewatch 9pm, BBC2 As anyone who has been to Glasgow will tell you, Scots like a good barney. (In fact, the surname of Barney, after whom barneys were so called, was MacTavish.) No surprises, then, that the last duel in Britain was fought in Scotland, in August 1826. Even less surprising, if we're persisting with national stereotypes, it was between a Kirkcaldy man and his torn-faced bank manager. The former was a member of the emerging middle class, while the latter was an ex-soldier. Their duel to the death, tantalisingly told, thus exemplifies a country in flux: the old order kicking back against a new regime. Thrilling. Pulling 11.30pm, BBC3 Technically, this is a repeat, but Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly's 2006 sitcom was so brilliantly observed, so exquisitely excruciating, so laugh-out-loud funny, it deserves a second viewing. Horgan's Donna decides, at her hen do, that she isn't going to marry her fiance, the nice-but-dull Karl. Instead, she moves in with dysfunctional pals Louise and Karen, and finds that life as a singleton is as horrendous as being part of a couple, albeit in different, awful ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
