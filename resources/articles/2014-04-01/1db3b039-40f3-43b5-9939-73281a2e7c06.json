Just give me a few details \u2013 then we can flog you stuff for years\", Viewpoint). I've been campaigning on this issue for years in my own area since the birth of my baby, when I first encountered the astonishing Bounty Pack. Stuffed full of what I assumed was nonsense, I found my child benefit form, some interesting information about local breastfeeding groups and other NHS leaflets about how to keep my baby alive. I could hardly believe that Bounty was entrusted to deliver this vital information to parents and the fact that it came with heavy advertising from Pampers and Sudocrem seemed incongruous at best. Did I have to clad my baby's bum in Pampers and stinky zinc cream to claim my child benefit? Did I have to read all the endless bits of paper to make sure I wasn't missing some instructions on how to avoid cot death? In 2014, we want our healthcare delivered by midwives and doctors rather than underpaid Bounty reps. Let's politely ask them to leave and let new mums get on with recovering from childbirth, learning the mysterious art of breastfeeding and having some toast and tea. Get the midwife to hand over the child benefit form. After all, far fewer of us are entitled to it these days. Jessica Ormerod National Health Action party candidate for the European elections May 2014 London SE6 Your article was an unfair attack by Mumsnet on our company. We are direct commercial competitors and often work with the same brands. Almost a year ago, Mumsnet began a \"Bounty Mutiny\" campaign, which attempts to stop our Bounty Ladies from seeing new mums. We listened to the concerns they raised and changed the way we did business, launching an independent advisory board and introducing uniforms for Bounty Ladies to distinguish them from hospital staff and How Did We Do? feedback cards. Without us, many of the most vulnerable new mums would miss out on the vital public health information that is no longer distributed in hard copy by the NHS. They also wouldn't receive the free products and money-off coupons we provide, which help new families save money at a time when demands of their family budget will be most severe. Similarly, although available online, child benefit forms still need to be printed out and posted and, despite living in a digital age, the fact is that not every young family \u2013 and especially those that need child benefit the most \u2013 will have access to a computer at home, let alone a printer. It is parents such as these who not only need child benefit most, but who also rely on it being found in Bounty Packs. Clare Goodrham, general manager Bounty I was glad to see Sarah Crown drawing attention to the way in which Bounty reps prey on women on maternity wards. Only hours after giving birth, six months ago, I was harassed repeatedly by a rude and irritable Bounty rep while still bedbound and enjoying a few quiet and emotional moments with my new baby and my husband. On reflection, I feel angered by how inappropriate the rep was and how these people are able to take advantage of women in such a vulnerable situation: I was too tired to argue with her when she asked me yet again for my email address because Pampers needed it. I am sure that many women fail to recognise at first that Bounty is not an arm of the NHS doling out good advice and freebies, but in fact a data marketing company that has bought its right to roam our maternity wards.
