His dramatic promise last week to leave Gordon Brown in charge of the Treasury after 5 May underlined just how determined Labour is to keep its enviable economic record centre stage for the next four weeks. But as our panel of experts makes clear, Brown's impressive economic scorecard may not be an automatic vote-winner. When the economy is going well, it tends to slide down, not up, the voters' list of priorities. 'At this election, stability, prosperity and interest rates are on the ballot paper,' he said proudly last week. But 'stability' is unlikely to get the voters' pulses racing. The Chancellor wants electors to cast their minds back to the torrid economic times of the 1980s and early 1990s, when the Tories were in charge. But with only minor differences between the two parties on macroeconomic management, it will be hard to whip up the fear of economic disaster which the Sun summed up in in its notorious polling day headline in1992: 'If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?' And the Tories have worked hard to try to build up the credibility they lost in the wake of the Black Wednesday debacle. 'The interesting point about the economy is whether people discount it now,' said Peter Robinson, chief economist at left-leaning think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). 'The economy has been performing well for a decade: unemployment's low, inflation's low, and people are beginning to take that for granted. It's the squeaky wheel that gets the votes.' 'That's the problem for the government,' agrees Vince Cable, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman. 'The economy is their strongest suit, and people are taking it for granted.' 'Compared to the rollercoaster of the 1980s, it's like a scenic elevated railway,' says Steve Andrew, chief economist at fund managers F&amp;C. 'The scenery's fine, the view's rather pleasant, but it's not terribly exciting.' That smooth, boring ride may not continue indefinitely. The housing market is slowing, consumers are beginning to rein in their long-running spending spree, and the boost from rapidly expanding public spending is fading away. Andrew believes that in a year's time, the environment will feel rather different. 'Things are going to slow down, and without those additional forms of stimulus, you're looking at a pretty sluggish environment in the medium term. The Labour government has slowly clogged up the arteries of the economy by spending more money, employing more people, chipping away at competitiveness.' But for the time being, Brown has a clean sheet of rock-bottom unemployment, steady growth and low interest rates. A series of potentially more divisive economic issues have been neatly postponed until after the election. Council Tax bands are being re-evaluated, based on house prices on 1 April. Homeowners will not find out the results until next year, but there are likely to be painful increases for those who have seen the value of their properties rise much faster than the average. Ministers have hinted that the system could be reformed, but no firm proposals are likely to emerge until after the election. The Lib Dems have pledged to replace the Council Tax with a local income tax, and plan to highlight the 'unfairness' of the current system throughout the campaign. Britain's 'pensions crisis' is another weighty problem that has been conveniently shelved. Many experts believe the problems of Britain's ageing society and households' failure to put aside enough for their retirement will not be solved without either compulsory saving, or an increase in retirement ages - or both. Adair Turner, the government's pensions guru, has issued an interim report spelling out the scale of the problem - but conveniently, he will not reveal his recommended solutions until after the election. Perhaps the most pressing issue that Brown has managed to postpone is the one the Tories will attack him on most strongly during the next month: the question of whether he will be forced to raise taxes to meet his self-imposed spending rules once the election is over. The 1 per cent increase in National Insurance contributions in 2002, after Labour promised in 2001 not to raise income tax, infuriated business. Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin will lay down a 'tax challenge' to Brown over the next few weeks, asking how he will raise extra cash if, as most experts predict, revenues fall short of his projections over the next year or so. However, Letwin's own plans, which involve a \u00a34bn package of tax cuts, plus a spare \u00a38bn to fill the 'black hole' in the public finances, only add up if his ruthless waste-cutting proposals are achievable. He has promised to increase spending on schools and hospitals, at the same time as offering tax cuts, by ruthlessly squeezing administrative costs, but 'efficiency savings' are notoriously hard to achieve. The TUC last week criticised the 'myth' that the public services are stuffed with bureaucrats who could be sacked without affecting delivery. The Lib Dems' Cable questions the sums in the James review, which sets out the Tories' waste cuts. 'The point is that they're trying to have it all ways: to be tax-cutters, and spenders. Once you start analysing the James stuff, it's pretty flaky,' he says. Labour has seized on the \u00a335bn gap between its own spending plans and the Tories' by 2011. But even one year ahead, the average error on public spending forecasts is \u00a310bn, and by 2011, both parties' proposals are rather hazy. Labour simply says it expects spending to expand at the same pace as the economy after its current spending round ends in 2007. The Conservatives want spending to grow a little more slowly, edging the share of public spending in the economy down to 40 per cent, against 42 per cent in the government's plans. 'The \u00a335bn number is unhelpful and misleading, but it does highlight the fact that the instincts of the two parties are different,' says the IPPR's Robinson. For Letwin, government is too big and should do less, and reducing taxes frees up resources for the private sector: but he admits his concrete proposals for cutbacks are 'modest'. 'To be cynical, you could say that the Conservatives are minimising decisions they would have to make if they really want to get taxes down,' Robinson says - although he believes Labour is also underplaying how hard it will have to slam the brakes on in order to hit its own spending targets. 'There's no way they're going to be able to hide, in next year's spending review, quite significant reductions in the rate of spending growth.' For business, taxation is a central issue. Most of Brown's pre-election Budget giveaways were funded by closing corporate tax avoidance loopholes, and firms fear they will be first in the firing line if he needs more cash. Complaints about 'red tape' have also become increasingly noisy. Businesses have appreciated many of Brown's initiatives on skills, competition and investment; but they criticise his tinkering approach to corporate taxation and business legislation. 'Companies often say we are encouraged to invest, we are encouraged to compete, but we have one hand tied behind our backs,' says David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which estimates that red tape has cost up to \u00a340bn since 1997. 'There's more legislation; there's the whole issue about family-friendly policies, which increase businesses' costs. Business is at the heart of the economy: we should be nurturing that.' The Tories will certainly want to tie the collapse of Rover to the charge that Labour has neglected Britain's manufacturing base, which had already been substantially hollowed out by the devastating recessions of the Conservative years. If 'stability, prosperity and interest rates' were indeed on the ballot paper on 5 May, as Brown would like, voters would be hard-pressed not to put a cross in his and Labour's box. But as the niggles of Britain's businesses show, now the economic rollercoaster has been replaced by a smooth ride, voters may have found other things to worry about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
