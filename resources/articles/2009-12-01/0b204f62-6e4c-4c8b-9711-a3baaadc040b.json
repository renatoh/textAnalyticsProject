Robert Earnshaw seemed intent on equalling that marker single-handedly, as he punctured Leicester City's defence on many occasions and, in the process, bagged the match-winning hat-trick. Earnshaw had scored just three times this season going into the match, but two goals in his last two games gave an indication that the mercurial Welshman was finally finding his groove. \"When he's on his game and when he plays with that energy that he played with today, that's Robert Earnshaw at his best,\" said Forest's manager, Billy Davies, as he celebrated a result which lifts his side above Leicester in the Championship play-off positions. \"They were three great goals. [But] it doesn't surprise me. That's what he's all about.\" Earnshaw opened the scoring in the 12th minute when Forest exploited the visitors on the right flank. With acuity and skill, Earnshaw dummied his run over a low cross, allowing the ball to reach Dexter Blackstock, and off a measured pass from his attacking counterpart, he stroked it neatly past the keeper. His second was a touch lucky as the ball ricocheted kindly to his feet, but the finish was exquisite as he gently clipped the ball over goalkeeper Chris Weale. Such was Earnshaw's confidence, he even attempted an audacious 40-yard lob in the final seconds before the interval, though his effort flew well over. The third arrived three minutes into the second half. Forest broke at speed and Earnshaw cut inside his marker before drifting the ball into the top corner. The 28-year-old has scored hat-tricks in all four divisions of the football league, in both domestic cup competitions and for his country. Blackstock was instrumental in Forest's fourth \u2013 he supplied Paul Anderson and the Leicester-born midfielder lashed the ball home. Substitute Dele Adebola tapped in the fifth after the visitors' penalty through Martyn Waghorn. \"This team has been waiting to score a few goals against somebody,\" said Davies, whose side are unbeaten in 11 matches. \"There's been many other games in the past where we should have scored three, four, five goals from the chances we create and the way we play. \"We were really, really well organised, disciplined and our concentration at the back was first-class.\" This was not a case of Forest exposing small holes in Leicester's defence; these were gaping chasms, the like of which Nigel Pearson has seldom witnessed in his time in charge of the club. \"The performance was an embarrassment,\" he said. \"We didn't start the game well and we didn't put them under enough pressure. That's not a typical performance from us. \"They are my team and I take full responsibility.\" The Managers' Verdict Billy Davies I still think we are short of Newcastle and West Brom this season but this is a great result for us. We've been waiting to score a lot of goals against someone and today we achieved it. But December and January will sort out the men from the boys and if we are still in the mix in mid-January we will look at the situation then. Nigel Pearson When you are facing local derbies it is about making sure you are focused and up for it but we lacked that and it is not a very nice thing to have to say. It was the worst performance and worst result since I have been manager, but what I will say is that, although it doesn't make it any easier to stomach, it doesn't happen very often. The Fan's Verdict Was it a good match? This was supposed to be the first of three tough games this week. In the end it was anything but. We dominated from start to finish and thoroughly deserved the goals that came our way. Leicester struggled throughout and looked a shambles at times \u2013 their fans should expect better. But this season gets better and better for us \u2013 we fear no one at this stage. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Robert Earnshaw showed his class with three expert finishes but this was a great team performance. While the headlines will focus on our striker the real star was Chris Cohen \u2013 his energy and passion was an inspiration. Leicester defender Wayne Brown had a torrid afternoon and is struggling at this level.
