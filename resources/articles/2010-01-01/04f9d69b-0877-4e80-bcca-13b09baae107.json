At the top end of the game the Premier League find themselves in conflict with Uefa over rearranged games that will have to take place on Champions League nights, and the FA will come under increasing pressure to allow clubs to settle Cup ties on one day and free up some space. At the lower end of the league ladder, some clubs have yet to play a game this year and face cash flow problems in addition to reduced gates when Saturday matches are eventually staged in midweek. As all Premier League and most Championship clubs now have undersoil heating to prevent any repeat of 1963, fixture chaos in football ought to be a thing of the past, yet the present cold snap threatens to be more disruptive than almost anything that has happened before. Not because games are now called off for safety reasons more to do with the stadium and its surroundings than the state of the pitch, or even because the police will not allow games to be rescheduled at the drop of a hat and generally require at least a week's notice. The reason top level football can ill afford any sort of disruption to its programme, least of all a protracted one lasting two or three weeks, is that there is no longer any slack in the fixture calendar, no easy way of fitting in extra games later in the season. There was no Champions League in 1963, for instance, and while English teams were involved in European competition in 1963, the number of games was small and deadlines flexible. Champions League deadlines are not flexible, and it is not only a matter for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, the clubs still involved when the competition resumes next month. Uefa try to insist that on no other football games take place on Champions League nights so as to minimise distractions and maximise the television audience, though the Premier League have refused to commit to this. Ordinarily, clubs would not wish to stage rearranged games either on evenings when live football is available on television, yet this season that may have to change. The three clubs involved in the Champions League are going to find it difficult to rearrange league matches in midweek, and Manchester United have a two-leg Carling Cup semi-final to fit in. Should those games be put back any further by worsening weather, they will begin to affect the FA Cup as well, and replays in the latter competition would be even more of a headache than they usually are. While he has managed to avoid the problem this season, this time last year Sir Alex Ferguson was examining a long-standing but little known FA rule that allowed teams to play extra time after a first meeting in the hope of avoiding a replay. The United manager was under the impression that if both teams agreed in advance of the tie a result could be obtained on the day, by penalties if necessary, though this turned out not to be the case. The FA confirmed that clubs could indeed agree to extra time after a first meeting \u2013 the rule was designed to help non-lleague clubs in early rounds for whom a replay might be geographically or logistically difficult \u2013 though as a result of Ferguson drawing attention to the matter the loophole has now been closed. Extra time is no longer possible in any circumstances after one game and, as was already the case, no FA Cup tie before the semi-final stage can be decided on penalties on the same day. The FA have no plans to change their rules twice in the same year, and will not attempt to alleviate fixture congestion by suspending replays even temporarily. \"We are not expecting any changes to the FA Cup format,\" a spokesman said. \"Replays will still be fulfilled, though clearly any further games lost to the weather would make life more difficult.\" Ferguson is probably not the only manager who would like to see an end to replays, though supporters and accountants at teams less prosperous than Manchester United have a more traditional point of view. One unseen aspect of freezing conditions is that training is often disrupted. It might be imagined that leading clubs now have state of the art indoor facilities to beat the weather, yet Blackburn eschewed their gymnasium to train on the Ewood Park pitch before last week's Carling Cup semi-final was eventually called off, because it was the only patch of grass in the district that would take a stud. With the north east under snow Steve Bruce has even been considering taking Sunderland training to the beach, except he reckons it is too cold. That is not a case of modern footballers being as soft and unwilling to risk discomfort as modern society, to paraphrase Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. It is a little known fact that extreme cold can be as dehydrating as extreme heat, and physical performance usually declines in cold conditions. Yet indoor training is unsatisfactory for different reasons. \"It's tough at the moment because of the weather,\" the Sunderland manager said. \"If I'm honest we've only trained properly once in two and a half weeks, and the one thing you need at Premier League level is proper preparation. Working indoors is not ideal. It's frustrating and it doesn't help the injury situation. We've got a few calf injuries at the moment and the last thing you want to be doing with calf injuries is running in gyms.\" Cheltenham of League Two were looking forward to a bumper gate for today's derby against Hereford that had to be postponed, and will not make the same amount of money from a game rearranged in midweek. If their next home game, against Rochdale on 23 January, beats the weather it will be their first for seven weeks, and chairman Paul Baker admits it will be difficult to pay wages. \"We were expecting a really good crowd for Hereford, a gate of over 4,000 and receipts of around \u00a340,000,\" he said. \"We will be doing our best to honour our obligations to staff and players but any business at this sort of level is going feel the impact if you take \u00a340,000 out of the cash flow. All clubs find this sort of thing difficult but especially those who do not have financial reserves to dig into.\" Carlisle, a division higher, face some onerous midweek treks to fulfil fixtures in addition to smaller crowds. Today's home game against Millwall was the third Carlisle game called off in the space of three weeks, and once the thaw comes the Cumbrians will have to make midweek visits to Exeter, Colchester, Hartlepool and Leeds. \"The situation with postponements is getting past the joke stage now,\" their manager, Greg Abbott, said. \"We are looking at seven matches in the rest of January and February, and that will put a great strain on my squad. I can't afford any more injuries, and with having to train indoors the weather is also holding back the recovery of players trying to return from injury.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
