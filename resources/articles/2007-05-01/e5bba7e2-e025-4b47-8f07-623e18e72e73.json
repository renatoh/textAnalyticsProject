After four increasingly polished forays into churning, riff-driven party rock they are now model-bagging, arena-filling heroes. Album five, however, calls time on their radio-friendly years. Founder member Josh Homme's ever-catchy formula remains, but the mood is uneasy and brooding, with tracks such as 'Sick, Sick, Sick' revealing a venomous new band that's finally learned to separate business and pleasure. Gripping stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
