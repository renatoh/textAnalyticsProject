The Channel tunnel train firm yesterday announced it had market shares of 68% on its Paris route and 63% on its Brussels services during the first 10 months of the year. Eurostar released the figures to coincide with this week's 10th anniversary of passenger rail services under the Channel. It had planned a reception, but the event was cancelled out of respect for victims of Saturday's rail crash in Berkshire. Passenger numbers have jumped by 16% this year to 6.04m. Eurostar has spent heavily on advertising since its journey times were cut by 20 minutes with the opening of the first stage of the high-speed Channel tunnel rail link through Kent. Paul Charles, Eurostar's director of communications, said the improvement had brought Paris and Brussels within \"day- trip range\" of London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
