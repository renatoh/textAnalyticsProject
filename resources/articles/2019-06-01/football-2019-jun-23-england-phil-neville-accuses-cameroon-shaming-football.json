Alain Djeumfa\u2019s side had transformed this last-16 tie into farce with his team briefly refusing to restart the game after an England goal was given by VAR and another from Cameroon disallowed. Afterwards Neville advised them to \u201cget your ship in order\u201d. England emerged with a 3-0 win but plenty of bruises. Steph Houghton, the captain, was said to be in \u201csevere pain\u201d while receiving post-match treatment after a blatant cynical stamp on an ankle from a Cameroon player. Houghton is now a serious doubt for the Norway game but England\u2019s coach, who revealed that there had been \u201cfighting\u201d involving the Cameroonian entourage at the hotel the two teams are sharing in Valenciennes, seemed even more worried about the wider damage. \u201cI came to this World Cup to be successful but also to play a part in making women\u2019s football globally more visible, to put on a show that highlights how women\u2019s football is improving,\u201d Neville said. \u201cBut I sat through 90 minutes today and felt ashamed. I\u2019m completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition and their behaviour. I\u2019ve never seen circumstances like that on a football pitch and I think that kind of behaviour is pretty sad. Think of all those young girls and boys watching.\u201d Neville also confirmed that Toni Duggan had been deliberately spat on in the first half. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty clear, that\u2019s one of the worst things you can see on a football pitch,\u201d England\u2019s coach said. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of Toni, she just wiped it off and played on. I\u2019m so proud of my players\u2019 behaviour. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell the truth and say that I\u2019ve never seen behaviour as bad as Cameroon\u2019s on a football pitch before. It was like being a kid when you lost and you went home, crying, with the ball. I didn\u2019t enjoy the 90 minutes, I just felt sad. I can\u2019t gloss over it and fudge it, I have to tell the truth.\u201d He had little sympathy for Djeumfa and his risible claim that the referee had wanted England to win. \u201cArs\u00e8ne Wenger told me teams mirror their managers,\u201d Neville said. \u201cEngland players would never behave like that but if they did, they would never, ever play for England again. I would say to Cameroon get your ship in order first before you start throwing stones.\u201d In the second half the Lionesses should have had a penalty and Cameroon a couple of players sent off but the referee, diplomatically, refrained from making those decisions due to genuine fears the match would descend into total anarchy. By the end she genuinely seemed to fear for her physical safety. \u201cThe referee was trying to protect football by not giving the penalty or the sending-off at the end when Steph\u2019s ankle was stamped on \u2013 I admire the referee unbelievably,\u201d said Neville, who revealed that there had been trouble with Cameroon\u2019s entourage in the VIP areas as well as the team hotels. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Cameroon people fighting in the VIP area. We\u2019ve seen Cameroon people fighting in our hotel. I\u2019d say to the Cameroon people \u2018get your ship in order\u2019. I don\u2019t want to talk about what happened at the hotel. \u201cWe\u2019ve handled ourselves with pride; the players with the best humility, class and quality have won. I\u2019m not here to criticise a national team but we want the image of women\u2019s football to be good for little girls. Cameroon\u2019s actions were so bad for the image of the game I\u2019ve fallen in love with. I hope they will learn from this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
