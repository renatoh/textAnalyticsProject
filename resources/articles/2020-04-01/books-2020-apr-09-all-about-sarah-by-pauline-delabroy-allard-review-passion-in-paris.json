One is a teacher, the generally sensible mother of a young girl; the other is a flamboyant, beautiful violinist who talks loudly and exudes a captivating spontaneity. The teacher, who narrates the story, falls for Sarah with a consuming, destructive passion. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Sarah the impetuous, Sarah the passionate, Sarah the sulphurous.\u201d They are both overcome by their desire, losing their bearings in their lives. And then Sarah is overcome by breast cancer, and the novel begins and ends with them clasped in an embrace in which Sarah may or may not be dead. This is Pauline Delabroy-Allard\u2019s first novel and it became a massive success when it was published in France last year: titillating with its frank descriptions of sex and erotic paeans to the female body (\u201cher earlobes. Her moles. Her thighs. Her violet vulva\u201d) and captivating with its investigation of the suffering involved in passion. It\u2019s a brief, intense read. There is no world beyond the physiological experiences of the lovers. We see into the narrator\u2019s mind only when she is experiencing the effects of desire, or falling apart in its wake. Other characters \u2013 the lovers\u2019 parents, the narrator\u2019s daughter \u2013 appear but are not given a chance to exist. Much about the tone of the novel reminded me of Le\u00efla Slimani\u2019s work. As with Slimani, there\u2019s a combination of breathless excitement and flatness: as though Samuel Richardson has been crossed with Albert Camus. In both cases there is something compulsive about the reading experience, partly just because the feverish rhythms carry us along. Here\u2019s a typical passage: She lets me catch up with her at the last minute, she doesn\u2019t fight when I undress her and force her to get into the bath where I wash her meticulously under the astonished eye of the resident cat, she cries silently while I go shhhhh between my teeth, shhhh like someone soothing a teething child or a strapping man felled by fever or an old man preparing to die, come on, shhhh, it\u2019s over, there, shhhh. The passion has already become harmful here. The excitement of burning with desire has become exhausting, so they start to tear each other apart. There\u2019s an arbitrariness in the destructiveness that makes it unconvincing. In the great novels of ill-fated passion \u2013 Wuthering Heights or Anna Karenina, say \u2013 the story is richly embedded in a social world that makes the lovers feel doomed partly by forces outside their control. Here the two women live ordinary middle-class lives, going to the theatre, taking the narrator\u2019s daughter to school. I couldn\u2019t quite believe in the necessity for them to destroy themselves. Even the breast cancer felt curiously expedient, as though the illness was a necessary consequence of the destruction, rather than a cause of it. There\u2019s a long, much-contested tradition that associates lesbians with death. Think of Djuna Barnes\u2019s Nightwood, also set in Paris, where Nora and Robin are caught in a cycle of vampiric love: \u201cWe love each other like death.\u201d In Barnes\u2019s novel the doomedness could be associated more easily with outsider status. Delabroy-Allard toys with introducing homophobia, but in general passion \u2013 and perhaps especially lesbian passion \u2013 is shown as possessing a violence of its own. This leaves Delabroy-Allard reliant on symbolism. Sarah loves playing Schubert string quartets and the narrator becomes terrified by the words of the song that hovers beneath his \u201cDeath and the Maiden\u201d quartet. It could be argued that the arbitrary nature of both passion and destructiveness is precisely what the novel is about. It\u2019s partly an exploration of the solipsism that sex can seem to justify, pushed almost to the point of comedy in a book that still manages to remain humourless. When Sarah is in Japan during an earthquake, the narrator wonders if in fact they are the earthquake, and their relationship is \u201cthe seismic shift that made everything judder for several kilometres around\u201d. This is why the breast cancer feels unreal: it may just be another warped consequence of their desire. The best parts of the book are where the narrator goes deeper into inhabiting her own craziness in Sarah\u2019s absence. She abandons her possibly dead lover and effectively non-existent daughter and goes to Trieste. It\u2019s as though Delabroy-Allard fully accepts here that she has given up on the social novel altogether, and moves instead into a form of travel writing that ends up being more alluring and disturbing than the sex scenes. I found the \u201cglimmering gold, blindingly beautiful\u201d Adriatic the perfect backdrop for the narrator\u2019s decline, if only because the dreamlike setting stopped me minding how wilfully unconvincing the characterisation is beneath the seductive prose. \u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).
