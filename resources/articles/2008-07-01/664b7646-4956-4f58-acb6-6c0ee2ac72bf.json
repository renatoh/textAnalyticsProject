On the final evening of the City of London festival, St Andrew church in Holborn hosted a rewarding early programme by the rising Pavel Haas Quartet and percussionist Colin Currie. At its centre was the premiere of Since Brass, Nor Stone ... by Alexander Goehr, a 12-minute movement evoking the metallic, earthy and fluid imagery in Shakespeare's Sonnet No 65. In the most lyrical of his dance-like episodes, Goehr writes a melody that almost fits the text - but rather than being sung, it is played on a glockenspiel, ear-splittingly high yet buoyed by the strings. The sound-world is glossy, glinting and individual. The Quartet No 2, by Pavel Haas, which brings drums into its rumbustious finale, made an apt counterpart. Haas, who died in Auschwitz, was Janek's star pupil, and his music has the buzzing textures and joyful melodic invention of his teacher. Charterhouse (a former monastery turned noble's townhouse, school and now home for the elderly) hosted Counterpoise, an unlikely quartet of piano, violin, trumpet and saxophone, who, with Eleanor Bron as speaker, gave the London premiere of Edward Rushton's melodrama On the Edge. Dagny Gioulami's magpie-like text gathered Alpine passages, including a spooky fairytale and advice on when to flee an avalanche, quirkily illustrated by Syl Betulius's videos. Rushton's score, with its sparing textures and itchy, altitudinous figures, allowed us to concentrate on the text."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
