Chelsea go into Saturday\u2019s confrontation with Aston Villa having lost four of their eight Premier League fixtures, with the Portuguese benefiting from public backing from the hierarchy after the last of those defeats, against Southampton a fortnight ago. The club sacked six managers in as many years between 2007 and Mourinho\u2019s return, including Roberto Di Matteo five months after claiming London\u2019s first European Cup, with the trigger for that dismissal \u2013 like those of Luiz Felipe Scolari and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas before him \u2013 the fear the side might miss out on Champions League qualification. Yet Mourinho had been convinced that short-term attitude no longer persisted in his initial talks with Abramovich and the director Marina Granovskaia over a potential return to Stamford Bridge two years ago. Asked if he thought he would be retained by Chelsea even if he finished in mid-table, the manager said \u201cYes\u201d before claiming times had changed. Asked to explain why, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s different for many reasons. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s different just now, but since the moment I came back in 2013. When I had my first conversation with the owner and board in 2013.\u201d Mourinho had met Abramovich immediately after concluding his media duties in the wake of the game against Southampton and before a board meeting that night, and had been reassured there was no immediate threat to his position. The club further demonstrated their commitment to him by issuing a 57-word statement proclaiming their support 48 hours later, with senior players having since offered public backing. \u201cI met the owner before dinner so, when I left, I knew [there was no threat of the sack],\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cBut, even before that, I knew what brought me here. I know the conversation we had two years ago. I know what made me sign a new contract, and the reasons the owner and board decided to give me a new contract over the summer. They didn\u2019t have to. I still had two years to run on the previous deal, so they didn\u2019t have to give me a new contract. So what I know is what I know from them. \u201cObviously, after a bad result \u2013 and that was not the first bad result of the season \u2013 I was far from happy. Far from it. But I never felt [concerned] about my future. For me the important thing is the owner and the board\u2019s message to myself and, before the statement came out, I\u2019d had the feedback from the owner and the board. So the statement was not something new for me. That support I\u2019d got before. Why did the statement come out? Maybe to stop the rumour that I could be on my way. The support to myself was not made by the statement, but by a normal conversation that we\u2019ve had many times. This time it was to support and to make me completely aware of the club\u2019s intentions.\u201d Mourinho is convinced Chelsea will revive and finish in the top four \u2013 no club have achieved that from a position of eight points after eight games \u2013 but the importance of victory over Villa is all too clear. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is expected to start in midfield, with either Kurt Zouma or Ramires at full-back in the absence of the injured Branislav Ivanovic and Diego Costa returning from domestic suspension up front. The Spain striker, omitted from his national side\u2019s squad for their final two Euro 2016 qualifiers, admitted last week he had returned for pre-season \u201cslightly overweight\u201d with those fitness issues having nullified his own impact to date. \u201cHe\u2019s an honest guy, and a guy that says that is not, for sure, the leader of any \u2018mutiny\u2019,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy who assumes his own responsibility. \u201cHis weight was a consequence of a bad approach, but also of a difficult last third of the season: suspension; injury; re-injury; not playing; disappointment; not participating in the best period of the season, when you become champions; go on holiday; go to Brazil. The food is much better than here. For a Brazilian, the food in Brazil is divine. He stayed there at home and came back in bad condition. He could have used many excuses for our bad moment, but he chose himself and his condition as one of the factors. So respect.\u201d The Chelsea manager confirmed it was his decision to appeal against the punishment meted out by the Football Association for his post-match comments at the Southampton fixture. Mourinho had suggested referees were \u201cafraid\u201d to award his side decisions and, despite anticipating sanction, was taken aback by the \u00a350,000 fine and suspended one-match stadium ban announced on Wednesday. \u201cI want to appeal because I disagree totally,, and not just partially, but totally with the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously my decision, but I don\u2019t want to say anything else. Other than I disagree totally.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
