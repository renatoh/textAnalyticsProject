Speaking in the House of Commons in a debate about the green paper on the BBC, Ms Jowell said it provided \"clear strictures\" for restraining what in the past had been \"unacceptably predatory competitive behaviour by the BBC\". She highlighted the new quota system unveiled by the BBC in December as one of the tools to stop the corporation slipping back into its old ways. Ms Jowell continued with her warning, saying: \"The BBC's role in not acting in a gratuitously competitive way in relation to other broadcasters, is a very important part of retaining plurality on broadcasting.\" Two years ago, independent producers' alliance Pact accused the BBC of a \"callous disregard\" for the industry after the corporation failed to meet its quota for independently produced shows for the third year running. The failure is estimated to have cost production companies \u00a377m. Ms Jowell went on to dub the licence fee a \"venture capital for creativity\", adding: \"There are great possibilities as yet under-developed for the independent sector in making its contribution to that.\" The minister defended the green paper to MPs, some of whom were sceptical about plans to replace the BBC's governors with a new BBC Trust. Ms Jowell said: \"This house should understand the radical nature of these changes. It deals with the unsustainability of the present position but it does something else as well, which places accountability of the BBC Trust very clearly in relation to the licence fee payer.\" The shadow culture secretary, John Whittingdale MP, used part of the debate to repeat calls for the BBC to admit it had made a mistake in paying \u00a34,500 to convicted burglar Brendan Fearon to take part in a documentary about farmer Tony Martin. The BBC has defended the move, saying there was an \"exceptional public interest\" in having Mr Fearon's story of the break-in, during which Mr Martin shot and killed Mr Fearon's 16-year-old accomplice Fred Barras. Mr Whittingdale said: \"There is a widespread view that the BBC got it wrong and I think they should say so.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
