Not eminent, not famous, but prominent. What does that mean? Conspicuous. Sticks out. Maybe a bit too much. Like a protruding forehead, which, come to think of it, is another of my characteristics. A sign of intelligence, apparently. Prominence is easily achieved. Talk in a loud voice in a crowded room. Organise a few conferences. Edit a volume or two. Done. And largely on the back of the efforts of others. Eminence is another matter. That is what gets you on Newsnight. In reality, the media is a terrible place to form an opinion of your worth. If Jeremy Paxman introduces you as \"the eminent microbiologist\", that's his way of praising himself for having the pulling power to get someone important on the programme. He'd hardly say \"no one has actually read her stuff, but she is the only microbiologist that came up when we Googled\". Fame and eminence, people tell me, have their price. But so does prominence. One measure of success as an academic is the degree to which others publish responses to your work. Stands to reason. You write to contribute to a debate. Mostly the debate doesn't take any notice, but sometimes it does. And so a decent index of your standing is whether others think you are worth the trouble of a reply. For years there was virtually no reaction to my work. But as time wore on, a few PhD students sent me bits of their theses where I was ground into the dust. So they thought. Ha! And then a few published papers mentioning my writings began to appear. At first, the only form this took was simply to quote my crystalline summaries of well-known ideas. Quite flattering, but, at the same time, an insufficient boost to the academic ego. After all, one wants to be known as a great original thinker, not as someone with a flair for precis. Then a few criticisms started to appear. A trickle, rather than a flood. Still, this, I told myself, is what I had wanted all along. The question, though, was what to do about it. Good manners, as well as career advancement, suggest that some sort of response was called for. But it isn't so simple. In some cases, to respond would mean thinking my way back into an issue, reading the latest contributions, and working long and hard formulating a response. In others, I felt criticisms were based on the most mean-minded and uncharitable reading of what I had said, but a reply pointing this out would seem rather petty and petulant. In the end, I've left almost all unanswered. Not, generally, because I accept the criticisms, but because I cannot generate the spark of enthusiasm necessary to do anything about them. Should I hang my head for not playing the game? Well, as the comedian Paul Merton puts it, I must have been off school the day they taught the rules. You have to pretty much make it up as you go along, including working out how to allocate your time. Much of mine seems to be spent booking yet more train tickets to go off and deliver yet more talks at yet more meetings. There doesn't seem to be a rule about how many speaking invitations you should accept, or how many PhD theses you should examine, or how many papers you should read for journals, or, indeed, how quickly you should respond to emails. The only rule, it seems, was formulated by Spinoza. Every determination is a negation. Or, in other words, any decision to do something is a decision not to do something else. Accordingly, a central task for academics these days is managing negation. And the greater the prominence, the greater the negation.
