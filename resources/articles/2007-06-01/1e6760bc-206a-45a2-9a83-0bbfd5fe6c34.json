Not the Two Nations Disraeli was referring to when he first coined the phrase, an absolute gulf between the haves and the have-nots, but to something altogether more subtle and, in its own way, just as divisive. I'm talking about Britons and their food. Last week it became clear we are fast splitting into two constituencies so utterly distinct that only a miracle will put us back together. In one corner is the fifth of the adult population who don't realise that sausages come mostly from pigs and are stunned to learn that oats are grown by British farmers. They are joined by the thousands of children who told an earlier poll they were quite certain that cows laid eggs and that the source of bacon was, in fact, sheep. This is the part of the nation that lives in a food ghetto, where fish is never seen without a coating of breadcrumbs. Contrast this with the epicurean paradise that is Whole Foods, which opened its first superstore in Kensington, London, and promptly found itself overrun with consumers in pursuit of 20 varieties of tomato, 12 sorts of asparagus and 400 types of cheese. What matters to these shoppers is not simply getting their hands on recherche ingredients but the provenance of even quite familiar foods. Where did this cow live before it ended up on your fork? What Whole Foods consumers seem to crave is narrative, in contrast to those respondents to the polls who want to be relieved of the burden of storymaking. One set believe in \"once upon a time\" while the other wants to start from \"now\". It would be easy to dismiss the store as a let-them-eat-organic-cake kind of folly were it not for the fact that the supermarket chain is a huge hit in the US and has plans to open 40 more stores in Britain. Partly in response, Waitrose has just announced that some of its branches will be going still more upmarket, selling an even wider range of flamboyantly fresh produce. The worry is that this type of initiative has made the business of buying and eating food so complicated that those of us who feel we can't keep up are increasingly minded not to try in the first place. I will never forget the contempt with which one cultural commentator looked at me when I revealed - admittedly during a discussion on Radio 4's The Food Programme - that I couldn't imagine ever having the time or energy to make my own stock. \"I think,\" said the commentator witheringly, \"the world divides into people who can be bothered to make their own stock and people who can't. And I must admit that I would find it hard to be friends with someone who couldn't.\" We didn't talk much going down in the lift. Still, it seems help may be at hand, perhaps even that miracle needed to bind Britain's diverging food communities into a wholesome single organism. After five years' absence, Delia Smith has announced that she is returning to TV with her particular brand of sane yet satisfying cookery. The series will be based on her classic How to Cheat at Cooking, a much-loved volume which didn't mind suggesting that taking the low road and getting to the dinner table first and unflustered was not such a terrible ambition. Smith is a more interesting cook than most people remember, but she doesn't have much truck with showing off. Like a firm but fair domestic science teacher, she knows there is a textbook way of doing things in the kitchen while accepting that most of us have more important things to worry about than getting our hands on a rare variety of mushroom which can be harvested only at midnight. \u00b7 Kathryn Hughes is the author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton kathryn.hughes@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
