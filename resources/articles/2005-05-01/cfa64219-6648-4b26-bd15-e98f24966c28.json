Wembley in 1979 witnessed the most extraordinary conclusion of any Cup final, and the drama remains etched in the participants' minds. More than a quarter of a century on, joy or despair still fill their voices as they recall the closing stages. \"Everyone talks about it being a five-minute final,\" says Sammy McIlroy, part of the United side. \"In those five minutes I went from such a high to probably the saddest feeling I ever felt in the game when the final whistle went.\" That is no surprise. Two-nil down with five minutes to go, United staged a stirring comeback and seemed to have forced extra-time. Gordon McQueen scored, then McIlroy equalised after a mazy run, the ball bobbling over the line. Amazingly, though, Arsenal responded with an 89th-minute Alan Sunderland goal and this time United were finished. \"A great climax to an ordinary game,\" says Graham Rix, whose cross laid on the winning goal. \"A lot of Arsenal fans missed the goal. So many have told me over the years that they had their head in their hands thinking, 'What have we done?'\" Huge numbers of United followers, also, were too busy celebrating McIlroy's equaliser to have their eyes on the pitch and initially they wondered what the cheers from Arsenal supporters were all about. \"Unbelievable,\" reflects McIlroy. \"To get the equaliser was an amazing feeling. I could have played for another 90 minutes the way I felt then. I just looked around and thought, 'We can do it now.' And then to lose after that... Our problem was we thought it would go to extra-time.\" As McIlroy sank to the turf afterwards he received consoling words from Pat Jennings, the Arsenal goalkeeper. \"But no words could comfort me,\" he says. \"It was like I thought I had won the pools and then realised I hadn't put the coupon in.\" There had been no sign of a United comeback, with Arsenal cruising on the back of first-half goals by Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton. When McIlroy equalised, Arsenal thought they had blown it. \"We were beaten, no doubt about that,\" says Rix. \"If it had gone into extra-time we would have lost because we had lost the impetus and they had the upper hand.\" Terry Neill, the Arsenal manager, could suddenly envisage a repeat of the defeat to Ipswich in the 1978 final. \"There were a myriad of things going through my mind,\" he says, \"including 'You are going to be labelled losers now'. \"You realise the cameras will be focused on the bench to look at the reaction. You try to do a bit of acting, to look concerned but not panicky, but, inside, my heart was going off the scale.\" Nor would it get any respite. Liam Brady's initial thought was simply to get as far from his own goal as possible but his pass enabled Rix to cross and Sunderland to score. \"I just raised my arms and gave thanks to the heavens,\" Neill says. \"After the way the last five minutes had gone you would have needed a brick for a heart not to be a bit emotional.\" Rix remembers rather more colourful celebrations from his manager. \"There's a great clip of Terry Neill jumping like a nutcase when we scored the third goal,\" he says. \"And all of a sudden he realises he's Arsenal manager and straightens his tie and acts cool.\" A misjudgment of Rix's cross by United's goalkeeper Gary Bailey was crucial. \"Myself and Martin Buchan went chasing after Rix,\" Lou Macari says. \"We were hoping he would cross. He lifted it in and I thought, that's going to be the goalkeeper's, we're going to extra-time.\" Wrong. There were no recriminations in United's dressing room afterwards, just silence. \"For about 20 minutes I don't think anything was said,\" Macari recalls. \"In 1977, after winning the Cup, I was in bed at 10 o'clock the following morning. In 1979 it was 10 o'clock that night.\" Neill missed some of Arsenal's celebrations. \"I just wanted to go for a walk on my own,\" he says. \"I went into Hyde Park and wandered about, savouring it quietly, and then went back to the party.\" He has never watched the final on video but has heard it. \"Peter Jones, who did the BBC radio commentary and who's sadly no longer with us, sent me a tape a week or so later with a message saying, 'Well done, listen and enjoy.' \"I listened to it while driving and nearly crashed the car at those last few minutes. The hairs on the back of my neck were standing up with Jonesy's commentary. I thought I'd lose it. I didn't play it too much after that. It was too scary.\" 79 line-ups Arsenal Pat Jennings Pat Rice Sammy Nelson Brian Talbot David O'Leary Willie Young Liam Brady Alan Sunderland Frank Stapleton David Price Graham Rix Sub Steve Walford (Price, 83) Man Utd Gary Bailey Jimmy Nicholl Arthur Albiston Sammy McIlroy Gordon McQueen Martin Buchan Steve Coppell Jimmy Greenhoff Joe Jordan Lou Macari Mickey Thomas Sub Brian Greenhoff (unused)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
