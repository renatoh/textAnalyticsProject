Solondz unerringly finds the grotesque, the marginalised and the dispossessed. Are they simply a freak show? Do we laugh at them, with them, or not laugh at all? Or has Solondz found a way out of the traditional constraints of restraint, respect and correctness, smashing through into a new realm of post-modern empathy? Palindromes is about a 12-year-old girl called Aviva (incurious when someone points out that her name is the same forward and backward), who runs away from home with one goal in view - to get pregnant. A Bu\u00f1uelian alienation technique neutralises any possible sympathy or anxiety we might feel for Aviva. She is played by half a dozen different actresses, ranging from a tiny white waif to a very big African-American woman. It keeps the viewer on edge and off balance, and certainly constitutes a startling formal challenge thrown down to the audience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
