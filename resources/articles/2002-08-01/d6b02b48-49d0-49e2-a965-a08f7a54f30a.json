When it launched in 1902, the magnificent German ship the Preussen was the largest and fastest sailing boat in the world. The Royal Clipper, built in 2000, was inspired by the Preussen and is only the second fully rigged five-masted ship ever to have been created. Its 42 sails pay homage to its heritage, but the Clipper remains very state of the art: modern improvements include luxury accommodation - and a navigation system. The ship can accommodate up to 228 guests, and during the summer it glides around the Mediterranean providing passengers with spectacular and romantic reminders of the past. Destinations include Italy, Sicily, the Balearics and Corsica, and there are trips throughout July to October. Royal Clipper cruise prices start from \u00a31255 per person. Call 01473 292229, or visit the Star Clippers website for more information.

You can see the royal bedrooms and state dining rooms in all their sumptuous glory, contrasting with the basic crew quarters below deck. Admission \u00a37.75.

Kayaking, canoes, windsurfing, yachting, catamarans and scuba diving are all available for hire with or without lessons (www.eridan.org or www.reseauppp.com). The area is currently enjoying some serious investment with the expansion of Oceanopolis - a superbly designed marine aquarium with separate tropical, polar and temperate zones - and Buzz has recently opened up a regular route to Brest from Stansted, making it inexpensive and accessible in under an hour for around \u00a380.
