Bolt said his electrifying run, in which all the field bar the injured Asafa Powell went under 10 seconds, was further proof that he always delivered on the biggest stage. \"When it comes to the championship, it's all about business. It's what I do,\" said Bolt. \"The reason it's sweeter is because a lot of you guys doubted me. I'm showing the world I'm the greatest and I'm going to show up on the day.\" Bolt admitted that he got off to a shaky start \u2013 and still managed to finish in an Olympic record time that has only been bettered by his own world record. \"My start wasn't the best. But my coach had already explained to me not to worry about the start. I came with one goal. The last 50m is where I shine.\" The Jamaican beat his friend and compatriot Yohan Blake by 12-hundredths of a second but paid tribute to him for giving him a \"wake-up call\" when he beat him in the Jamaica trials in the 100m and 200m. \"I've told Yohan Blake that I'm not going to have him beat me again. The trials woke me up. Yohan gave me a wake-up call,\" Bolt said. \"He knocked on my door and said, 'Usain, this is Olympic year, wake up'. After that I refocused and got my head in the game.\" Jamaica's sprinting phenomenon, who has faced persistent questions about his fitness in the run-up to the Games, said that a back injury that troubled him earlier in the season no longer worried him. As he tried to rationalise his achievement in winning another gold medal, he uncharacteristically admitted that he was \"slightly nervous\". But once he got on to the track, the nerves went away. \"It means one step closer to being a legend. That's one step, I have the 200m to go, so I'm looking forward to that.\" There was no showboating from one of the world's greatest showmen, out of respect for the depth of talent in the field. \"I just ran. I ran my hardest and ran through the line,\" he said. Bolt said he had been criticised after his 100m victory in Beijing because he had not beaten Tyson Gay but that no one could say the same about London. \"It was one of the greatest races of all time. The field is a championship field,\" Bolt said. \"After Beijing people were saying it was because Tyson wasn't there so I had to go and beat him in the world champs the next year. To have the four next best in the world, it was an honour to go out and compete.\" An emotional Justin Gatlin, the American once banned for four years for doping offences who won bronze in a personal best of 9.79, said the rest of the field were trying to catch up. \"Track and field is evolving. Bolt's a very fast guy, a true competitor and a showman. We're going to go out to try to run faster,\" he said. Bolt said he hoped to still be competing in four years' time in Rio, when he'll be 30. Blake, and the rest of the field, still have some catching up to do. \"This is just a great thing. These guys are stepping up their game,\" Bolt said. The gold medallist said he would not be going out to celebrate until after his 200m but was enjoying being in London. \"Britain is a wonderful place. They have done extremely well in cycling and rowing. It's a great Olympics. All I do is put my feet up and watch TV.\" Bolt, who famously ate chicken nuggets before his Beijing triumph, said he had gone for a healthier chicken wrap this time, before loading up on rice and chicken before the race. Although he has frequently paid tribute to London, he also complained about the petty bureaucracy he had been subjected to in the hours before one of the biggest races of his life. \"I was told I couldn't bring my tablets in. Why? 'It's just a rule.' I had my skipping rope in my bag and I couldn't bring that in. Why? 'It's just a rule.' I have a rubber mat that I need to take inside to stretch but I couldn't bring it in because it's just a rule. \"It's just some weird small rules that don't really make any sense to me. The guy was telling me to stand in a straight line. I'm about to run, are you going to tell me to stand in a straight line? They are strange rules that don't really make any sense.\" Bolt also said his false start at the world championships in Daegu last year had played on his mind before the race but that once he heard the reception from the crowd any nerves dissipated. \"It does play on my mind, I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it. But when I came out and they announced my name and the crowd gave me that roar, everything just went away.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
