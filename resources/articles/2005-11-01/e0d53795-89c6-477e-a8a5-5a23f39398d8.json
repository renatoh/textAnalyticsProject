The promise of thrills and spills has not been met and for the second week running the portfolio moved less than a tenner. I can only plead that it's not deliberate. As promised, more money has gone on the table. I added six names to the portfolio last week and added to the size of three existing positions, so the ingredients for larger moves are there. Indeed, I'm approaching the maximum number of positions for a speculative portfolio. A stock now has to offer a compelling argument to get in, but two caught my eye last week. The first is Euromoney, one of those consistent performers that get little attention. The heart of its business is specialist financial magazines, admittedly hardly the racy end of the media sector. Seminars and conferences are a fifth of revenues, as are training and information services. Euromoney is so low-profile that even the Financial Times didn't bother to report its results last week. They were excellent: full-year pre-tax profits of \u00a335.8m were about 10% above analysts' estimates and sent the shares up 8% on the day. Even after that jump, it is possible to imagine them trading 20% higher. Certainly 500p, compared with the current 450p, looks more likely than 400p. The best growth came from events and training, now its biggest combined earner. Profits from financial publishing were up a more modest 9%. But there is potential for larger gains because advertising by Wall Street investment banks, which have enjoyed a vintage year, is still subdued. The key to Euromoney, though, is its incentive plan for employees below board level. It brought in the scheme a few years ago to encourage managers to focus on profitability. Publishing and conferences offer huge scope for wasting money on everything from travel perks to vanity flagship events. A culture of profits-first would seem to be sensible if not essential. I'm always surprised that more companies don't offer incentives further down. I suspect many boardroom directors regard performance-based rewards as their personal gravy train rather than tools of management. I've only worked for one firm that operated a scheme and was convinced of its power. It sounds as if Euromoney's directors are also convinced: they're already talking about a successor scheme from 2009. Investing in Euromoney means exposure to the general state of the markets, but it's an interesting way to make the bet. Consider it top of this week's possible buys. The only other addition to the buy list is CSR. I am suddenly fascinated by this company. The former Cambridge Silicon Radio, operating from the Cambridge Science Park, has run up from 200p at flotation in March last year to 850p and is now valued at \u00a31bn. CSR is the king of bluetooth technology - chips that allow short-range wireless communication. Bluetooth is now the standard application and could almost be said to have brand recognition. Mobile handsets, headsets, PCs and car music systems are the big markets and CSR's customers include some of the biggest names: Motorola, Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, Toshiba, Renault, BMW and Toyota. Its success, in the face of competition from the likes of Texas Instruments and Philips, is extraordinary. Its share of the market is a little over 50% and the boom in this technology is demonstrated by the company's progress. From virtually zero operating profits in 2003, it should make $115m (\u00a367m) this year. I may have come to the CSR story too late, but it appeals to my gambling instinct. The market always has problems valuing fast-growing technology companies and will almost inevitably overdo the optimism at some point. CSR's long-term progress depends on developing technology to succeed bluetooth, but right now it's an intriguing momentum stock emerging on to the radars of mainstream investment houses. Readers thinking about actively trading in the stock market should seek independent financial advice. Spread betting and contracts for difference are complex financial instruments that carry high risks and are not recommended for inexperienced investors. Specifically, their use can lead to an investor losing substantially more than their initial investment. \u00b7 The capital for the Speculator exercise is the Guardian's, and half of any profits will be donated to charity at the year-end.
