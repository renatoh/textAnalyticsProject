The biggest annual growth was in its consulting division, up 14% on 2012, a leap that Deloitte claimed was a sign that British businesses were starting to gain confidence and invest for growth. David Sproul, the chief executive, and senior partner who took home \u00a32.7m, said: \"This is a strong performance for our firm given the continuing challenging economic environment. \"I believe UK businesses have reached a turning point in terms of confidence and, with substantial cash holdings and improving credit conditions, they've got the firepower to invest for growth. The appetite for risk is increasing and clients are showing greater willingness to invest. This is evidenced by a higher demand for those services that are focused on helping clients grow.\" Profits for the year to end of May also rose 8%, from the previous year to \u00a3609m. Deloitte said it had recruited almost 1,700 graduates, school leavers and students last year, and was expecting similar numbers to join again this year. It promoted 48 new partners in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
