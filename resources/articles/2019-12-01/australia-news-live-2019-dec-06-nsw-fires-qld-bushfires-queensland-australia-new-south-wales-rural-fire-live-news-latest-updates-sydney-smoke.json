As of almost 7.30pm AEDT there are still seven fires at emergency warning level across NSW. They are: Bangala Creek Carrai East Gospers Mountain Green Wattle Creek Kaloe Mountain Trail Kerry Ridge Wrights Creek There are 12 fires at watch and act level. You can find out more about the fires in NSW here. In Queensland, there is an emergency warning for Redbank Creek, with four other fires at watch and act alert level. You can find more information on those fires here. My colleagues Ben Doherty and Helen Davidson have more on the forecast for tomorrow and the fire situation today here. Some more photos from photographer Matthew Abbott out at Kulnura: In Kulnara firefighters are regrouping as the wind changes again, now coming from what seems like the south. It\u2019s hard to tell. The gusts are erratic. Smoke is thick and visibility low. Spot fires and grass fires are being jumped on quickly before the main front comes through. The Kulnara brigade has set up at a ridge line property, where the owners have been preparing for weeks. Lines of hills are visible but slowly disappearing in the smoke. And here are some more of Mike Bowers\u2019 photos from the Palerang fire in southern NSW: In Queensland for tomorrow, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe fire danger forecasts for Darling Downs and Granite Belt, Wide Bay and Burnett, and Southeast Coast. We are now back down to seven emergency warnings for NSW. They are: Bangala Creek Carrai East Gospers Mountain Green Wattle Creek Kaloe Mountain Trail Kerry Ridge Wrights Creek The fire came over the top and then came around here and took this, and one of the fire vehicles as well,\u201d says Rob Meggs, Hilson\u2019s neighbour. He\u2019s standing in front of the still-burning ruins of his shed and office. His house survived, thanks to the efforts of the RFS and metropolitan firefighters, he says. The shed was \u201ca hoarder\u2019s heaven\u201d. \u201cIt was chockers full of stuff, that might be a release in one way. But my office, that might be a bit more painful. It had some records in there that I won\u2019t be able to replace.\u201d He warns us not to get to get too close, he thinks all the petrol cans have exploded now but there are still paint cans under the collapsed tin. He stayed to defend the house. \u201cWe were advised earlier in the week at a meeting that the conditions weren\u2019t catastrophic and if you were physically able and prepared [you could stay].\u201d He\u2019s been in his house 22 years, and hasn\u2019t seen anything so big. \u201cI\u2019ll still continue to live here, now that this has been through it\u2019s probably good for another 50 years.\u201d At Kulnara, the Wright Creek emergency level fire this afternoon has taken out property. Dozens of firefighters and trucks are on scene ahead of pa predicted wind change, but unruly wind changes earlier in the day pushed a fire past some properties, only to swing it back towards them another way. Shane Hilson walks us around his property just north of town. He points at a line of trees on the edge of his far paddock in the distance. \u201cIt came in over the back, then it went right up along the ridge, and then it came back all the way down the back and around\u2026 with the wind change.\u201d Asked if they\u2019re in the clear now, Wilson laughs a little. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to burn.\u201d Hilson\u2019s wife and kids went to her mother\u2019s place two days ago in Summerland Point. His father in-law Trevor Colliss, came down to help him. He says his neighbour lost a shed. They\u2019re both bleary eyed. Hilson is nursing a tinny, and Collis says he has a cold cider waiting for him just up the hill. \u201cThese fellas have been marvellous, hey,\u201d he says gesturing at the RFS teams now driving out the gate. Earlier we reported three fires in the Hawkesbury, Hunter and central coast areas had merged, now it seems five have merged. We are back up to eight emergency fire warnings across NSW. As I was saying. Some stats from the RFS on fire impact since November 6: 684 homes destroyed 247 homes damaged 4,958 homes saved 48 facilities destroyed 60 facilities damaged 386 facilities saved 1,452 outbuildings destroyed 613 outbuildings damaged 4,526 outbuildings saved. My colleague Helen Davidson is on the ground near the Wrights Creek fire. For tomorrow, there is a severe fire danger warning in place for the New England and northern slopes of New South Wales. There is a very high fire danger warning in place for the far north coast, greater Hunter, greater Sydney region, central ranges, and north western. The Bureau of Meterology hasn\u2019t yet issued its warnings for Queensland tomorrow. The Paddocks Run and Little L fires have dropped to watch and act, bringing down the number of emergency warning level fires to seven. Meanwhile in South Australia, a severe heatwave. A brief update on where we are as of 4pm: There are nine fires at emergency warning level in NSW. They are: Carrai East Gospers Mountain Green Wattle Creek Kerry Ridge Little L Complex Meads Creek West Paddock Run Wrights Creek Bangala Creek There are another nine on watch and act level. 108 fires are burning across the state, 74 of which are not contained. There are 2,800 firefighters in the field. There is a total fire ban in place for seven areas of the state tomorrow. Smoke is still an ongoing issue in Sydney, with emergency departments reporting a 25% increase in people arriving with respiratory issues. NSW RFS says the smoke isn\u2019t going away any time soon unless a strong easterly arrives. In Queensland, residents of Cornubia are being advised to prepare to leave due to a bushfire there. Two other fires are at watch and act level, while three are at advice level. Some footage of the blaze at Green Wattle Creek. It is at emergency warning level. A lot of people were sharing an image around on social media last night of the Bureau of Meterology radar for today seemingly suggesting there would be cloud cover over parts of the greater area of Sydney. As you\u2019d know by now, there was no rain. If you look at the radar at the moment, you can still see what looks to be rain clouds in the general vicinity. It\u2019s just the smoke. The bureau explains in this blog post that often the radar can be fooled into making it appear as though there might be rain. It can be smoke, aircraft, large swarms of insects or flocks of birds that can trip it up. If you go to the rain forecast page, it will also tell you whether rain is expected. There are now seven areas of New South Wales tomorrow where there will be a total fire ban in place. NSW health officials are speaking in Sydney. There\u2019s been a 25% increase in the last week in people presenting to emergency departments with asthma and breathing problems. That\u2019s around 1,100 people. People with asthma are being advised to stay indoors if possible, carry your puffer everywhere, and to use the recycled air option on air conditioners. NSW Ambulance are responding to around 70 to 100 call-outs related to respiratory conditions. A six-year-old boy at school in western Sydney suffered a severe asthma attack, and is in a stable condition in hospital. A 32-year-old woman in the south western Sydney region also suffered a severe asthma attack while shopping today. We are now at nine emergency warnings, with the NSW RFS issuing an emergency warning for Wrights Creek on the central coast. The fire is currently west of Kulnara. There are eight emergency warnings in place in NSW. Those are: Carrai East Gospers Mountain Green Wattle Creek Kerry Ridge Little L Complex Meads Creek West Paddock Run. There are also seven fires at watch and act stage. Five areas of NSW will have total fire bans tomorrow \u2013 Greater Hunter, Central Ranges, New England, Northern Slopes and North Western. As I reported earlier, the Gospers Mountain fire, the Paddock Mountain fire, and the Little L Complex fires have some overlap now. Some media outlets are referring to this as a \u201cmegafire\u201d but I checked with the NSW RFS, and they\u2019re definitely not calling it that because they want people to know whether a fire is a threat to them, so the separate names remain the same. The combination of the three fires have now burnt approximately 316,000 hectares. As NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said earlier, this is larger than the size of Sydney. It would go all the way from the CBD out to the base of the Blue Mountains, about 90 minutes away from the CBD. Canada has sent down some firefighters to help out over the next few weeks. Here they are in Sydney. Residents of Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge are being advised to prepare to leave. The Milmerran fire is at watch and act stage. This video from the RFS shows how the embers from the Green Wattle bush fire are being carried away from the fire. The federal minister for emergency management, David Littleproud, has announced that Victorians who were affected by fires in Baw Baw, Cardinia and Latrobe can now apply for disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. Additionally those affected by the fires at the time will also now have access to up to 13 weeks of income support. People can lodge claims from Monday 9am. More information is available here. It\u2019s a hot one in Queensland. Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has announced that an extreme weather plan has been activated for the city\u2019s rough sleepers. That means getting extra water out to people on the streets, help for those with respiratory issues, and temporary accommodation. Libraries and other community centres are also being opened up to accommodate people during opening hours. Meanwhile in Queensland, residents around Bundaberg, Noosa and Gympie are being urged to keep windows and doors closed due to the smoke in the areas. That would be the Paddock Run, Little L Complex and Gospers Mountain fires overlapping. Last night I spoke to Tassin Barnard, the owner of a wildlife sanctuary on the NSW central coast that is currently under threat from the huge fires in that region. Barnard with her team and some helpful members of the public managed to evacuate over 300 animals, including kangaroos, koalas, chickens, emus, and two old wombats in a matter of hours. You can read more about that massive evacuation effort here. An emergency warning has been issued for the Green Wattle Creek fire in the Wollondilly local government area. The sheer size of the Gospers Mountain fire is worth putting into context. Just before midday, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, held a press conference with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, where he outlined what firefighters were facing today. Some of the mid-north coast fires added up to 300,000 hectares, while the Gospers Mountain fire was 200,000 hectares alone, he said. \u201cIf you took that one fire north of Sydney and put it in the CBD, it would stretch from the coast of the north and south heads and would go all the way back and be into the lower Blue Mountains. You\u2019re talking large fires on the outer rim of the Sydney environment.\u201d The smoke blanketing Sydney is likely to stick around for a while too, he said, unless there were good, strong easterly winds. Josh Taylor here taking over from Naaman Zhou. Here\u2019s where we are at in New South Wales as we enter into Friday afternoon. There are currently 104 fires burning in NSW, with 59 yet to be contained. Six of those fires are at emergency warning level and seven are at watch and act. More details on those fires can be found here. For the Gospers Mountain fire: The sixth fire at emergency today. Two new emergency warnings. We are now at five today. The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has also acknowledged the bushfire crisis, while at a press conference announcing internal NSW Labor reforms. \u201cI also want to acknowledge, and Anthony [Albanese] and I were just discussing this, the difficult circumstances being experienced across New South Wales right now, as a result of the bushfires. \u201cWe know from the south coast all the way to the border, we\u2019re experiencing very, very difficult circumstances. \u201cBoth of us would rather not be talking about this right now, but we made a commitment to you, we would come back before Christmas with the interim report.\u201d The full comments on that Turnbull post and his reference to the CPRS are here. Turnbull posts about the need to move to zero emissions. He is asked what he did to do that as PM. Another commenter says they are disappointed and will be voting Greens. Turnbull brings up how the Greens voted against the Rudd government\u2019s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 2009. Fires are worsening near Taylors Arm and Hickeys Creek near Kempsey on the mid-north coast. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has shared this picture \u2013 and a plea to combat the climate emergency. \u201cI have flown back into Sydney many times but never to a sight like this. The reality of climate change \u2013 hotter and drier means more fires. We have to accelerate the move to zero emission energy.\u201d A commenter has responded: \u201cYou were PM for almost three years and what did you do about it? You didn\u2019t increase the renewable energy target, you didn\u2019t phase out coal, you didn\u2019t provide subsidies for electric vehicles\u201d Turnbull replies: \u201cHow you vote is up to you, but don\u2019t forget the Greens\u2019 role in killing the CPRS in 2009.\u201d Fire activity is increasing at the Gospers Mountain fire, which is between Newnes and Wisemans Ferry, 75km north of Sydney. The fire is expected to merge with the nearby Thompsons Creek fire. Fire bans have just been extended in Queensland due to worsening conditions. Fitzsimmons continues: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got months ahead of challenge and the only forecast for rain is late January to early February of any meaningful substance.\u201d Fire and Rescue NSW say they\u2019ve moved 18 firetrucks and 72 firefighters out of inner Sydney to the western suburbs and the periphery of Sydney. 270 firefighters are in the field today, with 40 officers in incident management roles. (Note, this is in addition to other units like the RFS and interstate and international crews). Fitzsimmons says the prolonged drought is having a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on the fires. The RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says it will be \u201canother extremely busy day\u201d today. \u201cWe literally have fires of concern from the Queensland border, all the way down the ranges and the coast, to the southern border,\u201d he said. The south coast fire has reached the coastline in numerous places, and more are burning south-west of Sydney and west of the Warragamba Dam. Firefighters are having \u201can enormous amount of progress\u201d with fires near Katoomba, he said, but the ones north of Sydney, which have burned for weeks if not months and are now around Wiseman\u2019s Ferry, are really taking hold after lightning strikes in recent weeks. \u201cAll of those fires under the sorts of conditions expected today have the potential and are expected to spread further east towards villages communities and isolated areas,\u201d he said. She adds that conditions will be worse next week. \u201cWe are anticipating conditions worsening next week especially around Tuesday and that is why it is important for the community to remain vigilant,\u201d the premier says. Premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now in Sydney: \u201cCurrently we have over 90 fires burning throughout the state, about 40 of them are uncontained, but the difference now as we lead into the summer months is, previously there were pretty much confined to the northern part of New south Wales but what we have seen this week is our resources stretched across the entire coastline. \u201cWe have also seen the fires coming in very close proximity to major population centres whether it is on the south coast, central coast, or even greater western Sydney\u201d. She thanks the RFS and the volunteers for their work. \u201cWe know there have been some property losses, the extent of which won\u2019t be known until the fire conditions are safe for people to go in and have a look, but we also appreciate that many families and many people have been asked to leave their homes and we can appreciate what a scary time this is for many people.\u201d Vets are urging people to keep pets inside, if they have health issues or are otherwise vulnerable. Dr Kate Adams told AAP that older pets, or breeds with respiratory problems, could encounter life-threatening difficulties in the heavy smoke. \u201cSquishy-nosed breeds\u201d of dogs and cats are at risk, she said. Owners should look for signs their pets are struggling, such as breathing difficulties, coughing, vomiting, lethargy and runny noses and eyes. RSPCA NSW spokeswoman Sharon Andronicos said keeping pets of all species indoors was the safest bet. \u201cIf it is uncomfortable for a human to breathe, then it is uncomfortable for pets too,\u201d Andronicos said in a statement. \u201cI would suggest not doing strenuous activities or big walks until the smoke clears.\u201d Adams said owners should also turn on the air-conditioner to help filter the air and keep their furry friends cool. In Sydney, some hardware stores are selling out of pollution masks. Here\u2019s our explainer of what does and doesn\u2019t work. Yesterday, prime minister Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese both attended Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s Christmas drinks. Described as a \u201csmoky\u201d affair by the Sydney Morning Herald, the haze from bushfires was \u201cso thick that even the view of Rose Bay was obscured from their mansion, Le Manoir\u201d. It has not been particularly well received, given the emergency that is facing the state. Smoke and dust from Australia\u2019s fires are so bad, they have spread across the Tasman. Satellite images show that glaciers in New Zealand have been turned \u201cdirty\u201d, \u201csooty\u201d and pink, as reported by the New Zealand Herald. Fires were also threatening areas of Western Australia overnight. The threat from one south of Perth has lessened this morning, but authorities remain concerned about wind conditions and the risk of a flare-up. A watch and act warning remains in place for the fire at Nambeelup with authorities warning the blaze may still pose a threat to lives and property in the area. The fire is currently burning in bushland between Bush Retreat and Greyhound Retreat, and about 80 firefighters remain on the scene. Emergency WA says the fire is contained but not controlled and has burnt through about 65 hectares. Since early November about 20 homes have been lost in Queensland, with two homes gutted in the past day. Ten buildings have been damaged, including the two destroyed homes, by a fire in the Queensland Darling Downs. The fire forced residents at Forest Ridge and Cypress Gardens, near Millmerran, to flee their homes, and had burned through almost 1,200 hectares by yesterday afternoon. Queensland police allowed those residents to return to their homes this morning, while the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services downgraded the fire status to watch and act. My colleagues Naaman Zhou and Josh Taylor had a look yesterday about how the weeks of heavy smoke have been affecting NSW residents. One person from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, said they had suffered lung collapses as a result of aggravated asthma fits, requiring a drain in their chest \u201cfor several days\u201d. Another, on the mid-north coast of NSW said their GP had confirmed five weeks of smoke had exacerbated their lung conditions \u201cto the point where it could be affecting my heart\u201d. A Sydney GP, Kim Loo, said she was seeing a stream of patients on bad air quality days with \u201cnasal symptoms, sinus symptoms and sore throats\u201d. At a time when people are usually looking forward to their post-Christmas summer holidays, this year the outlook is grim. Read their full report here. The Sydney Morning Herald has published an extraordinary account of a fire blowup west of Sydney yesterday, where their photographer Nick Moir was on the scene. \u201cIt was simply an explosion of all of the bush being converted to raw energy. It was a massive roar. The sense immediately was just of intense heat. Myself, another Herald photographer Dean Sewell and the Rural Fire Service members just ran as fast as we could.\u201d The news is pretty grim all round, so let\u2019s take a quick break to see some school kids appreciating the firies. Prime minister Scott Morrison is holding an (unrelated) press conference and has begun by speaking on the fires. He\u2019s thanked those who have been working to fight them, defend homes and deliver information to the population. \u201cThis bushfire season is proving to be very very difficult, and we\u2019ve seen bravery displayed on every single day.\u201d NSW is experiencing \u201csome of the highest air pollution ever seen\u201d in the state with hazy conditions \u201cthe longest and the most widespread in our records\u201d, and it\u2019s caused by the bushfire emergency, according to the environment department. Poor air quality conditions are expected to continue today and into the weekend. Gary Flynn from the Wisemans Inn Hotel near that Three Mile fire, said the small town of Wiseman\u2019s Ferry was \u201cdead quiet\u201d as bushfires burned across the Hawkesbury River. \u201cWe are just copping all the smoke,\u201d he told AAP yesterday. Competitors at the Australian Open golf tournament face another day of playing through pollution after the state government issued a poor air quality alert for Sydney. The second round of the Open is under way at the Australian GC with a thick blanket of smog still hovering over Sydney. Matt Jones, the 2015 winner and long-time member at the Australian GC, complained of burning eyes from the smoke blowing in following Thursday\u2019s opening round. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe smoke\u2019s not good at all. It\u2019s tough to see your golf ball when you\u2019re out there playing, where it finishes. Your eyes do burn up. \u201cI\u2019ve got that cough like you\u2019ve got something in your lungs, phlegm in your lungs or whatever, but yeah it\u2019s not fun. \u201cI hope my kids are inside in the hotel room.\u201d There are six fires at watch and act level in NSW this morning, four of them very close together, inland from the Central Coast. The Gospers Mountain fire has burned through more 250,700 hectares of the the Wollemi, Yengo and Dharug National Parks, and Parr State Recreation areas, and there are fears it could join up with the nearby Little L fire near Singleton. Also not far away, the Three Mile fire has burned more than 11,390 hectares near Wiseman\u2019s Ferry, impacting the areas of Mangrove Mountain where firefighters are working to protect properties. To the north of the Gospers Mountain scene, a fire at Paddock Run has burned more than 5,900 hectares. It\u2019s moving east towards the areas of Howes Valley and Reedy Creek. South west of Sydney, the Green Wattle Creek fire is burning on both sides of Lake Burragorang. Authorities have told those in Oakdale, Werombi, or Orangeville, to enact their bushfire survival plans, and if the plan is to leave, to do that now before the fire threatens. The large Currowan fire between Batemans Bay and Ulladulla is also out of control, and under a watch and act warning. It is currently impacting the Lake Tabourie area, including areas west to Woodburn Road, where people are warned to seek shelter. It is too late to leave for those in Kioloa, Bawley Point, Pretty Beach, Pebbly Beach, Depot Beach and Durras North areas and the Termeil and Flat Rock areas. People in South Durras should leave now towards Batemans Bay if it\u2019s safe to do so. Good morning. It\u2019s another bad day for fires in NSW and Queensland. Conditions are expected to worsen after what was a tough Thursday in a tough month of firefighting. NSW was told to expect wind gusts of 80km/h and high temperatures, and Queensland will likely see temperatures about 12C above average over the next two days, surpassing 40C in the Lockyer Valley and Ipswich. On Thursday night NSW crews responded to five emergency level fires, including the Currowan fire on the south coast, where a number of buildings were believed to have been destroyed. Building impact assessment teams will inspect the area when it\u2019s safe enough to go in. By Friday morning the blazes had all been downgraded, with six fires in the state at watch and act levels. Less than half of the 97 active fires were under control. On Friday morning Queensland Fire and Emergency Services issued a watch and act warning for a large fire near Millmerran west of Toowoomba, which had blackened almost 1,200 hectares and was raging in the Western Creek state forest near Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge. Emergency crews were on alert amid concern that properties have been lost to a fast-moving bushfire on the Darling Downs. Meanwhile the smoke that\u2019s been bothering most of the NSW population whether you\u2019re near a fireground or not, is keeping the air quality in parts of Sydney and the central coast at unhealthy levels. We\u2019ll bring you updates throughout the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
