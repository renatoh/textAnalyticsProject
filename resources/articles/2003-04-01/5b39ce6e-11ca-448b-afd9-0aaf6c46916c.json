However, given that Thierry Henry, along with some other big names, did not start at Old Trafford or Chelsea in the previous two rounds, a weakened Arsenal still pack a considerable punch. Wenger does not want to be seen as taking the challenge of Sheffield United lightly, pointing out that they have twice knocked Leeds out of cup competitions this season and given Liverpool a run for their money in the Worthington Cup. He says: \"I have seen them many times and they are a good side. Of course, it is natural that we are favourites but the job is far from done. Nationwide Division One is stronger this season than in the past three or four years, partly because some of the academy players from the Premiership have moved down. \"Also, with all the foreign players in the Premiership, some good English players have also dropped into the Nationwide. Sheffield United are a case in point - they have [Stuart] McCall, [Nick] Montgomery, [Michael] Brown and [Michael] Tonge, who might all have been in the Premiership five years ago.\" With the Blades currently in one of the division's play-off spots, that of course is where those players all hope to be next season. But despite their heroics against Leeds and Liverpool, Sheffield United will find far more serious problems posed by an Arsenal who have spent the week chasing their stars out of the treatment room. Martin Keown is struggling with a hamstring and Oleg Luzhny may now be favourite to replace the suspended Pascal Cygan, who has been such a liability in recent matches. The England pair David Seaman and Ashley Cole will be back, however, in what could be, if Keown is fit, a first-choice defence. Meanwhile Gio Van Bronckhurst will sit on the bench and the talismanic skills of Robert Pires will be put on hold for Wednesday. \"He has a chance to play against United,\" says Wenger. \"Our injury situation is pretty good because at this time of year, you normally have a lorry load of injured players.\" The FA Cup, Wenger insists, cannot be viewed as a secondary competition when his team are on the verge of becoming the first to complete a Premiership-Cup Double in successive seasons. He says: \"We believe that is possible. We have put a lot into this cup competition, playing Manchester United and Chelsea twice. So we cannot now say that it doesn't matter to us. Although I might change one or two players because of the game on Wednesday, I am concentrating on tomorrow.\" The fear for Wenger is that Sol Campbell, whose achilles injury makes it difficult for him to play two games in a week, will struggle to make Wednesday's match, although Wenger is reluctant to drop him in favour of one of his reserves for tomorrow's match, particularly given the problems that Cygan has had when deputising for Keown. Defeat against the Blades before the colossal meeting with the other United is not on for Wenger, who says: \"The best preparation for any game is to win the previous one.\" Even so, it will be no surprise if Henry again starts on the bench, with Francis Jeffers given the chance to prove himself worthy of a first-team place. And Gilberto could be given another Cup vacation to allow Edu to perform at what must be his favourite away ground, having helped Arsenal win there in the Cup and to clinch the title last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
