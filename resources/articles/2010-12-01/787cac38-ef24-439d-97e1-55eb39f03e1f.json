But, while director Steve Marmion and his team have created a raucously interactive and inventive show, they still need to tinker with the basic model. Last year there were too many writers; this year a faint air of moral correctness hangs over proceedings. Dick (Steven Webb) is seen as a naive Gloucestershire lad who comes to London hoping to become famous on Britannia's Got Talent. But he is reminded by the recorded voices of Bow (Stephen Fry) and Bells (Alan Davies) that rat-catching civic duty is more important than fame and fortune. I liked the script, written by Joel Horwood and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, best when it puts puns before preaching. Its real strength lies in Shaun Prendergast's richly vulgar, hairy Sarah the Cook, who is extremely proud of her buns and scatters gags around like confetti. They range from the innocent (\"I took an origami class but it folded\") to the mildly risque. Instructed during a shipwreck to cling to Dick, Sarah saucily announces: \"I've done worse.\" At its best, the show reveals an unexpected touch of class. Simon Kunz's excellent King Rat acknowledges a debt to Shakespeare's Richard III by asking: \"Was ever woman in this humour wooed?\" Tom Scutt, who designed the RSC's Romeo and Juliet, has created sets and costumes that evoke a vanished Dickensian London. And Paul J Medford turns Dick's feline accomplice into a cool, sophisticated urban cat. His performance underlines an intriguing sociological point: that pantomime, absent from central London, flourishes in Hackney, Hammersmith and Stratford East, effortlessly blending diverse cultural traditions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
