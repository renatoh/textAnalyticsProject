But he took its message to heart and is always intervening to prevent the ministerial equivalent of failed states being overrun by Westminster's tribal warlords. Never the most patient public official, Bercow had to wait some time on Tuesday before sending in troops to restore order. This was probably because Foreign Office question time is so full of genuine threats to world peace and contentment that MPs feel obliged to set a high-minded tone. Burma, Syria, Nigeria, Argentina, there is very little that Her Majesty's mild-mannered ministers and MPs can do about any of them except wring their hands and endorse enhanced rights for girls and women in rural Afghanistan or the need for Iran to come to its senses. One particularly lawless area identified by irate Tories was the European court of justice, another the eurozone, which Basildon and Billericay's John Baron announced was both a \"dead man walking\" and \" a slow motion train crash\". Even William Hague felt obliged to deliver a formal protest at such violence inflicted on the English language. But Hague is powerless to do more without aircraft carriers. In the face of such peacemongering Mr Speaker was helpless too. But relief was at hand. As 3.30 approached a buzz of excitement swept the chamber and reinforcements poured in. Yes, Bercow had granted yet another urgent question to Labour's Andy Burnham over the latest threat to the stability of Andrew Lansley, the Somalia of the coalition. It was an opportunity to resupply the controversy with windy rhetoric and absurdly partisan points on both sides. MPs took it. At issue this time was the overnight letter sent by Nick Clegg and hardline moderate Shirley Williams, the adviser widely revered in the tribal uplands of Hampstead and Highgate. Sent ahead of this week's key meeting of the loya jirga \u2013 the House of Lords in local patois \u2013 the letter promised to amend the health and social care bill in ways that threaten the unity of the fragile coalition with the Cameroon fundamentalists. If there is one thing that upsets them it is moderation. There followed 42 minutes during which \u2013 so he proudly reported later \u2013 no fewer than 53 backbenchers got the chance to sound off and fire their rifles in the air. \"Order, order,\" cried Mr Speaker as they all overdid it. \" I granted this question because I wanted to allow members to scrutinise the government of the day. But courtesy; the secretary of state must be heard.\" A few minutes later he detected a Tory MP \"chuntering away\" and called him to order. Bliss to hear the sound of his own voice. It was not over yet. Instead of MPs drifting away, after Lansley defended himself unexpectedly well, more troublemakers, Labour and Tory, drifted in. Why? Bill Cash, the euro-bore's bore, sought an emergency debate to protect Britain from the illegal ambitions of the eurozone treaty which David Cameron sort-of-vetoed in December. Speaker Bercow gave the long-winded Cash just three minutes to make his case for spoiling Cameron's day with yet another embarrassing discussion of why he allows himself to be bullied by those treacherous Lib Dems. Cash did \u2013 and the Speaker granted the debate. A victory for backbench power or \u2013 as John Baron would put it \u2013 a dead train crash walking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
