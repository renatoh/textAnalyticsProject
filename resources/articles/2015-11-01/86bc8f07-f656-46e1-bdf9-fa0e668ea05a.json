Ings arrived at Anfield in the summer following the expiry of his Burnley contract but, as he was under 24, the Turf Moor club are entitled to a transfer fee to be decided by a tribunal. Liverpool valued the striker at almost \u00a36m while Burnley wanted \u00a310m and will argue that Tottenham Hotspur were prepared to pay around that sum for a player who was set on a move to Merseyside. The 23-year-old forced his way into Brendan Rodgers\u2019 first team towards the end of the Northern Irishman\u2019s Liverpool reign and made his senior England debut against Lithuania in October. However, days later, in training for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s first game as Liverpool manager, Ings ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament and may not feature again this season. The professional football compensation committee will consider submissions from Liverpool and Burnley before deciding Ings\u2019 fee. The PFCC is not expected to meet until the new year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
