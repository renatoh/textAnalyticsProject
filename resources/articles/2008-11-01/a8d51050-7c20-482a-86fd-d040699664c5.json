It's a packed agenda (these are busy people, after all) with speeches tomorrow from Air Chief Marshall Sir Jock Stirrup, the chief of defence staff, panels on the challenge of digital, making money from the web and changing newsrooms and a session on journalism training. Speakers include the BBC's Pete Clifton, the Guardian's Carolyn McCall and Alan Rusbridger, Pete Picton from Sun Online and Hugh Carnegy from the Financial Times. Later that day the BBC's Kevin Marsh talks to Robert Peston and Clarence Mitchell about the biggest stories of the year, Peter Preston chairs a session on P&amp;L and Andrew Moger talks about sport business rights. That's all topped off on Tuesday morning with the obligatory soul searching in a session on 'the future' before everyone flees again for another year. But first up: Daily Mail editor in chief Paul Dacre, who spoke tonight to a packed room on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's SS Great Britain. He has some real delights for you; for starters, denouncing Max Mosley's \"unimaginable sexual depravity\"... before going on to describe it in all its prurient detail. More Dacre from our own Oliver Luft, and plenty more on everything else as fast as we can get it to you. Full schedule here. What burning questions do you think they should be discussing?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
