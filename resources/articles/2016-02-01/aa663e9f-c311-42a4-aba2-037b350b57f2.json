Pellegrini started six teenagers at Stamford Bridge as City were thrashed 5-1 in the fifth round on Sunday, leading to the manager receiving criticism from some quarters and being accused of disrespecting the competition. But, having selected the strongest XI available to him for the match in Ukraine and then watched them comfortably beat the hosts, Pellegrini felt emboldened enough to stand by his weekend selection. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to take the right decision and think about a lot of things, about why you take this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this case, having just 13 players, it was a key decision to rest the team that day. Unfortunately we could not continue in the FA Cup.\u201d Goals from Sergio Ag\u00fcero and David Silva in the 15th and 40th minutes respectively were answered only by Vitaliy Buyalskyi in the 58th minute before Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s strike a minute before the end gave City a firm advantage for the return leg at the Etihad Stadium in three weeks\u2019 time and puts them in pole position to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time. Pellegrini said: \u201cI\u2019m very happy because it is a very good result. It is not finished but playing away and having a two-goal lead is very good. The team played well and had lots of chances. Maybe when it was 2-1 we had moments of doubt, but then we got the third goal. Is the tie settled? No, it is important in football to never think it is finished. But to have that third goal gives us more confidence for the second leg.\u201d After being knocked out by Barcelona at this stage in each of the past two years, Pellegrini is pleased with City\u2019s advance as a side in Europe. \u201cEach season we improve a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last two seasons we qualified for the last 16 and this season we made the important progress of winning the group, which was an improvement from last season. We now have the chance to arrive at the next stage and it\u2019s important if you can be among the best eight teams in Europe.\u201d Vincent Kompany, the captain, was also happy with City\u2019s result and display. \u201cThe performance was good, with a lot of high pressing,\u201d said the defender before praising an eye-catching late save by Joe Hart. \u201cThree-one is a good result and we are happy with it. Joe Hart is an unbelievable keeper. When he was called upon he did it well. We are going into the second leg with a fairly good chance to go through, which has not been the case before. We looked like a team that was hungry for success tonight. \u201cI feel like I am contradicting myself a little after the FA Cup but I feel like every cup is a priority. Every game is a priority. It is not easy to predict which competition you will do well in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
