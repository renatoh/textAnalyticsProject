Drug traffickers transport cocaine and methamphetamines through Pacific nations from the US and Latin America to Australia and New Zealand, where drug users pay the highest price per gram (about A$300 or \u00a3180) for cocaine and have one of the highest rates of cocaine use per capita in the world. While the route has been in use for decades, law enforcement experts told the Guardian that the quantity of drugs trafficked through it has exploded in the last five years. \u201cWe have to take ownership for the fact that this is a problem impacting the Pacific purely due to Australia and New Zealand\u2019s appetite for cocaine and methamphetamines,\u201d said Jose Sousa-Santos, who researches transnational crime in the Pacific at Massey University in New Zealand. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have Australian and New Zealand drug markets, we wouldn\u2019t have the movement of drugs through the Pacific.\u201d Sousa-Santos said Australia and New Zealand were the cash cows of the region and enduringly big profit margins would only lead to more movement of drugs. As part of the High Seas investigation, the Guardian found that trade through the Pacific is causing grave social harm in nations including Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, which now have domestic markets for the drugs and are suffering from addiction, corruption and violence. John Coyne, head of border security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that Pacific nations were the \u201cvictims\u201d of being caught between Australia and its drug supplier. \u201cThey are transit countries for organised crime in the importation of drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has ripple effects on issues such as corruption, foreign bribery, rule of law and those sorts of issues. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate [the impact] the appetite of Australia for illicit drugs has on countries in the Pacific.\u201d Superintendent Brett Kidner, who was based in Fiji as the senior liaison officer in the Pacific for the Australian Federal Police from 2016 to 2019, said the question of Australia\u2019s responsibility for the damaging impact of drugs in the Pacific is a topic that is \u201ckicked around a lot\u201d. \u201cThe Australian federal police, as well as the Australian government take the position very seriously and responsibly, and it\u2019s not a matter that we\u2019re responsible, but we do have a responsibility to our partners in the Pacific \u2026 to work collaboratively to stamp out organised crime and the illicit trade of any commodities, certainly that includes drugs,\u201d he said. Coyne said that the Australian government has \u201ca long history of engagement in the region\u201d and has provided defence programs, training opportunities, patrol boats, air surveillance hours and helped to establish a regional trans-national crime centre in order to assist Pacific nations with the fight against drug trafficking. But Sousa-Santos said that while there were some good initiatives in the region, he had encountered resentment among Pacific communities over the approach taken by Australia and New Zealand. \u201cThat is definitely the feeling on the ground in the Pacific, not only that there are not enough resources being put toward this issue, but they also feel that Australia and New Zealand are trying to protect their own borders, leaving the Pacific as a secondary concern.\u201d \u201cThe attitude still seems to be to stop drugs at the Australia and New Zealand borders and to utilise the Pacific almost as a shield,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the main driver continues to be how to keep Australia and New Zealand safe from the scourge of drugs.\u201d He said there were also complaints that Pacific law enforcement agencies were not treated as equal partners with their Australian and New Zealand counterparts. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: \u201cAustralia is stepping up its security engagement in the Pacific, including through key regional initiatives the Australia Pacific Security College and Pacific Fusion Centre. Together these programs will build Pacific capacity to combat drug trafficking through strengthened regional information sharing and coordination.\u201d A spokesperson fro the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that organised crime and drugs, particularly methamphetamine, is a \u201cserious concern\u201d for Pacific nations. \u201cWorking in partnership with Pacific neighbours to address drug-related issues is a priority for New Zealand, and for the region,\u201d said the spokesperson, who highlighted the work of the New Zealand government in the region, including a plan to invest NZ$9m over the next three years to support Tongan policing and justice, including supporting work to combat illegal drugs, the provision of detector dogs in the Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, and ongoing police, customs and immigration support for the region."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
