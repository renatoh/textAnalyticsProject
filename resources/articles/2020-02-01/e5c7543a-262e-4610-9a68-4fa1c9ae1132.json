If you squint really hard, and peer between the lines, you may conclude that he\u2019s not totally happy with his lot. Should Chelsea beat Spurs at the weekend, his post-match interview could be the most riotous thing transmitted live on television on a Saturday lunchtime since the days of Tiswas. You\u2019ll join us for that one, yes? See you soon! It\u2019s not quite up there with his famous Chelsea-Southampton soliloquy, but Jose Mourinho\u2019s post-match interview is quite something. BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly tries to get proceedings off to a positive start, asking whether we \u201csaw the real Spurs in the last 20 minutes\u201d. A glance is shot, Mourinho\u2019s steely gaze lingering longer than is strictly comfortable. \u201cCome on. What do you mean by the real Spurs? Come on. Tch. Come on. Let\u2019s be loyal to the boys and tell they did everything they could do. Lamela? You know how many training sessions he made with the team? Zero. Direct from injury to recovering on the pitch with the physios, to 20 minutes of a game in the Champions League. That is our team. You can see it from two perspectives. One perspective is, it\u2019s an amazing group with amazing guys. They try everything. By another side you see how we are in this moment. You look to the other guys, they play with Schick and Werner and Nkunku. Nkunku is tired, come out, there\u2019s Forsberg. Schick is tired, come out, there\u2019s Poulsen. This is our situation, it\u2019s like going to a fight with a gun but without bullets. You can tell me we had luck in some moments. I disagree. We had a great goalkeeper, that is not luck, that is a great goalkeeper. We had our chances and tried everything. I thank the fans. What worries me is,these are our players for the next, I don\u2019t know how many matches. In the next few matches we could see Lucas dead, Bergwijn dead, Lo Celso dead. I am so proud of them. But we are really in trouble. Don\u2019t tell me that Lamela and Ndombele could start the game, because they could not. But I could not be happier to have guys like them with the limitations we have, but here we go! Chelsea are drinking sparkling water with lemon while watching the game on TV, and Saturday morning, thank you very much, we are there again.\u201d Jacob Steinberg was our man at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening. His verdict is in ... and here it is! Hugo Lloris speaks. \u201cI want to stay positive, especially after the last 20 minutes. Obviously if we started the game in the same way, the score would be different. But there is a second leg, we still have a chance. We are still alive. We were a bit more proactive with the ball. But we have to give a lot of credit to Leipzig, they press very high and are a very good team. We have to stay positive, not give up, not try to find excuses, and fight to the end. We are not really happy, but we have to deal with that. Let\u2019s hope we can create another story.\u201d He\u2019s then given the man-of-the-match award, and doesn\u2019t look particularly pleased to receive it. \u201cEr, OK, but I\u2019d have preferred a win.\u201d Spurs depart for the dressing room looking glum. They were second best for most of that game. The match winner, Timo Werner, was excellent. So was Patrik Schick, though he missed one glorious chance to put Spurs in all sorts of trouble. Tottenham can take heart from the performance of Giovani Lo Celso, who sparkled in attack, and their performance during the last 20 minutes, when Lo Celso and Erik Lamela finally asked a few questions of Leipzig. But they\u2019ve got a big job on in Saxony in three week\u2019s time. The visitors stay on the pitch and celebrate with their fans. After this half-match (\u00a9 Jose Mourinho) they\u2019re halfway to the quarter finals. Bergwijn nearly beats Ampadu to a long ball down the middle, but the young Welsh defender holds firm, and that\u2019s that. Spurs have been outplayed at home and are reasonably fortunate to have limited the damage to a single goal. But all is not lost. They\u2019ve been here before. Two words: Ajax Amsterdam. 90 min +4: Lamela is booked for leaving a stiff arm in Sabitzer\u2019s startled coupon. 90 min +3: Bergwijn slips a pass down the inside right, forcing Ampadu into a desperate interception, sliding the ball out for a corner. But Lo Celso\u2019s delivery is overcooked and flies out the other side for a goal kick. 90 min +2: Winks tries to guide a shot towards the top right from the best part of 30 yards. It\u2019s weakly struck and easily snaffled by Gulacsi. 90 min +1: Leipzig knock it around the middle. Sixty seconds fly by. 90 min: Ampadu goes down with cramp. Mukiele needs a couple of swabs up a bloody nose. The clock ticks on. There will be five extra minutes. 89 min: Some pinball on the edge of the Leipzig box. Davies loops a cross in from the left. Halstenberg mistimes his jump, missing the ball and gifting Moura a free header, six yards out. He\u2019s got to work the keeper at the very least, surely, but slaps his header over the bar. What a chance. 87 min: Forsberg and Werner combine well down the left and earn a corner off Alderweireld. Leipzig don\u2019t commit many players upfield, and the set piece is easily cleared. 86 min: The corner is hit deep. Moura does well to rise highest, but can\u2019t get a header on target. A melee, in which a couple of Spurs players fall over. Nobody claims for a penalty. 85 min: Leipzig are beginning to ask for trouble, sitting deep and allowing Spurs to come at them. Moura comes racing down the middle and is upended by Forsberg. A free kick from a central position, 30 yards out. Lamela takes, curling one towards the bottom right. It\u2019s going wide, but Gulacsi turns it around the post anyway. A free corner for Spurs. 84 min: Some space down the right for Aurier, who whips a cross into the mixer. It\u2019s easy meat for Gulacsi. 83 min: Emil Forsberg takes Konrad Laimer\u2019s place. 82 min: Laimer goes down clutching his shoulder. He\u2019ll be replaced. He takes his own sweet time to leave, in the grand clock-management style. 80 min: Halstenberg clearly obstructs Aurier as the Spurs man looked to break clear down the right. No foul, according to the referee. That\u2019s a preposterous decision, and no wonder Jose Mourinho, on the touchline, performs the internationally recognised jig of fury, throwing his arms about, spinning around, effin\u2019 and jeffin\u2019 into the cool night air. 79 min: A lot of frantic nonsense in the midfield. Both teams fully aware of how important the next 11 minutes, plus stoppages, could be. 77 min: Spurs have enjoyed most of the possession during the last ten minutes, so Nagelsmann makes another switch. Yussuf Poulsen replaces Patrik Schick. 75 min: Lamela puts himself about in the Argentinian style, a sly block here, a cheeky clip there. That\u2019s also got the crowd shouting again. Plenty of noise as Spurs look for a precious equaliser. 74 min: Leipzig make their first change of the evening. Christopher Nkunku is replaced by Amadou Haidara. 73 min: Lo Celso curls one towards the top left. It\u2019s a wonderful free kick, sailing in, but it\u2019s tipped onto the post by Gulacsi and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but that\u2019s got the crowd going for the first time in ages. Lo Celso has been seriously impressive this evening. 72 min: Lo Celso runs hard at Leipzig again. He\u2019s clearly being tugged back by Nkunku, and earns a free kick, just to the right of the D. Nkunku is booked. A promising position, this, though before the whistle blew for the foul, Lo Celso had Aurier in acres to his right. But this is where we are. 70 min: Leipzig sit back and stroke it around with great confidence. Time is already on their side. 68 min: Lo Celso has been Tottenham\u2019s best player this evening, their only hope in attack. He dribbles elegantly down the inside-right channel, momentarily threatening to tie Leipzig up in knots. But he can\u2019t find the killer pass. 66 min: Dele Alli is seething. But Mourinho had to do something. Here\u2019s Peter Crosby: \u201cAh Ben Davies. Ah, Serge. We\u2019re back to the glory days of my youth when Dean Austin and Justin Edinburgh were tearing up and down the flanks letting in goals left, right and centre.\u201d 64 min: Spurs make a double change. Off goes Gedson Fernandes and an affronted Dele Alli; on come Erik Lamela and Tanguy Ndombele. 62 min: Leipzig nearly score after a wonderful sweeping move. There\u2019s acres for Angelino down the left. He rolls a pass inside for Werner, who throws Alderweireld off the scent with a sensational dummy, letting the ball roll to Schick, free on the penalty spot. He has to score, but flashes his shot straight at Lloris. Great save, but he should never have been allowed to make it. What a lovely move that was. Werner is living up to his billing. 61 min: A little space for Bergwijn down the left. He drifts inside then checks back and tees up Lo Celso, who pearls a decent strike towards the bottom right from 20 yards. It\u2019s well read and easily gathered by Gulacsi, though. 60 min: Spurs try to bounce back immediately, Lo Celso bursting down the right into space. But there\u2019s nobody near his pullback, and the visitors can clear with ease. There\u2019s a break on, with the livewire Werner romping down the left, but he\u2019s well marshalled away from the danger zone by Sanchez. Werner, as cool as a pickled cucumber, fires a low penalty into the bottom left. Lloris had guessed correctly, but even at full stretch couldn\u2019t get anywhere near it. A crucial away goal for the Germans. 57 min: Laimer took a bit of a whack. Looks like he\u2019ll be OK, but there\u2019s a pause before Werner can take the spot kick. 56 min: Leipzig stroke it around the back awhile, then suddenly spring forward, triangulating at speed down the right. The ball\u2019s switched to the other flank. Werner glides inside and slips a pass down the middle for Laimer, who takes a touch, enters the box, and is upended by a crude block by Davies. Foul, booking, penalty. No question. 54 min: A simple ball down the middle causes Sanchez all sorts of problems. He heads it straight into the air and back down towards Werner, who accepts the gift and purchases a cheap corner. Nothing comes from the set piece, but after a slow start to the second half, Leipzig are beginning to reestablish their earlier control. 52 min: Nkunku tries to whip one over the wall and into the top left. It\u2019s not a good effort, the ball sailing serenely over the crossbar. 51 min: Schick bursts down the left and is cynically clipped from behind by Aurier. Not exactly sure why the Spurs full-back hasn\u2019t gone into the book, but there we are. It\u2019s a free kick in a dangerous position, though, 25 yards out, just to the left of the D. 50 min: Leipzig loop crosses into the Spurs box from the left and then from the right. The home defence holds firm, though Werner was again buzzing around their heels with great purpose. It\u2019s very odd that this game remains goalless. 48 min: Spurs launch their first meaningful attack of the evening. Aurier swings a low cross in from the right. Moura extends a leg and forces Gulacsi into a parry from close range. Bergwijn hoicks the rebound harmlessly wide left. But that\u2019s so much better from the hosts, and the home fans respond accordingly. And we\u2019re off again! Spurs get the second half underway, and there have been no half-time changes. Not long after the restart, the Leipzig fans fling on a few toilet rolls. Everyone\u2019s a critic. They unfurl a banner which reads STAND UP FOR A FAIR PRICE CAP. Applause from all four corners of the stadium. After a clean-up operation, the game eventually restarts. Spurs weren\u2019t great in that first half, but their fans remain four-square behind the team. \u201cThe way I see it, Tottenham have no striker, no defensive midfield, and are keeping a clean sheet against a team in form,\u201d argues Gregory Greene. \u201cOur attackers aren\u2019t fluffing chances (they aren\u2019t getting any honestly), and I\u2019ve seen Tottenham defend worse. I can\u2019t really be mad.\u201d Meanwhile James Hopkin thinks a happy ending is written: \u201cThe big question in tonight\u2019s game (apart from which minute with Spurs score a late smash and grab winner) is why do a couple of the RBL players (e.g. Timo Werner) have all-white logos on their shirts and others have full colour red bulls?\u201d I have no idea. To get us all talking about everybody\u2019s favourite nerve-end-bothering beverage? Half-time entertainment. There have been goals in tonight\u2019s other match. Simon Burnton has the details. But don\u2019t forget to come back, y\u2019all. Alli busies himself down the left, flatly refusing to give up possession and winning a corner off Halstenberg. The same Leipzig defender heads the corner clear, and there\u2019s that whistle. Spurs will be pleased to get to the break without conceding. Leipzig have been by far the better side, and will wonder how they haven\u2019t bagged a crucial away goal. Some work for Mourinho to do during the break. 45 min: And that half-time whistle will be heard in roughly 60 seconds time. 44 min: Werner probes again down the left. Aurier just about holds him up. Spurs could do with the half-time whistle, though in retrospect that\u2019s been the case since the 26-second mark. 42 min: Here comes Werner again, down the left, winning another corner off Sanchez. The corner, once again, is not worthy of our time or consideration. 41 min: Werner whizzes down the left and nearly finds Schick in the middle, six yards out. Schick would be slamming home a sidefoot, but Sanchez slides in to bundle the ball out for a corner. What a glorious saving tackle. The resulting corner is a complete non-event. 39 min: Mukiele is back on. Good news for Leipzig, as he\u2019s been involved in a lot of their best attacks. Out on the other flank, Fernandes drops a shoulder to get past Angelino, and whips a cross to the near post, but Alli can\u2019t get his head on the ball. Tottenham\u2019s best half-chance of this half-match. 38 min: Mukiele is down in some pain, having taken an accidental whack to the left knee. That knee\u2019s already covered in tape, so he could have aggravated an existing problem. He grimaces an awful lot as he limps off for more treatment. 36 min: Leipzig should be leading. Schick and Halstenberg bus the ball right to left, and find Werner free, just inside the area. Werner\u2019s one on one with Lloris, but slams it straight at the keeper. The resulting corner is a waste of time. That\u2019s a poor effort from the much-heralded Werner, who is on a run of five matches without scoring. 34 min: They kind of have a point, but then Sabitzer, already in the book, gets away with a blatant clip on Fernandes. A free kick, nothing more. The Leipzig captain wants to watch himself here. One more clumsy one and he could be walking. 33 min: Winks shoves Schick in the back but gets away with it and races off up the left touchline. Werner sticks out a leg. There\u2019s no contact, but Winks goes over, and Werner goes into the book. Several Leipzig players, plus the manager, wear affronted looks. 32 min: The corner is sent long and half cleared. From 25 yards, Fernandes slaps a wild shot deep into the stand behind the goal. 31 min: Yet more space for Angelino down the left, sent away by Werner. But there\u2019s nobody to cross to, so he buys a corner off Sanchez. The same defender clears the set piece, and suddenly Lo Celso is tearing down the left in sensational style. He slips a pass forward to Bergwijn, who wins a corner for Spurs. Good end-to-end fun. 29 min: Spurs are struggling to keep hold of possession. Moves consisting of more than two or three passes are at a premium right now. The home fans are getting a little concerned. 27 min: Schick slips a ball down the left for the relentless Angelino, whose low cross is only just missed by a lunging Werner, hoping to poke home from six yards. The flag goes up for offside, belatedly and correctly, but Spurs are giving Angelino so much space on the left. They need to sort this out, because at some point the Leipzig attack is going to click in the final third. 26 min: Spurs enjoy a little possession for the first time in the game. They don\u2019t go anywhere in particular, but that should give them a little confidence in midfield, where they\u2019ve been thoroughly out-passed so far. 24 min: The right wing-back Mukiele flashes a crossfield ball towards his opposite number Angelino, whose cross-cum-shot is blocked. Leipzig are switching the play time and again, in the style of the reigning champions Liverpool. Julian Nagelsmann less Baby Mourinho, more Baby Klopp. 22 min: Atalanta have taken an early lead in their tie with Valencia. Hans Hateboer with the opening goal on 16 minutes in that one. Simon Burnton is all over that one. 20 min: The Tottenham plan is obviously to play on the break. Moura gets the better of Ampadu under a long ball, but can\u2019t see off Halstenberg. For a second, it looked as though he might break free. But the defender purchases a cheap free kick and Leipzig are off back up the other end, pinging the ball around once more. 19 min: Werner bursts down the left and finds Schick in the middle. Schick can\u2019t get either a header or shot away, and a combination of Sanchez and Winks manage to half-clear. Angelino comes again, sending a fizzer down Lloris\u2019s throat from a tight angle on the left. Spurs are getting mauled at the moment. 17 min: Schick rises miles above Davies and sends a downward header inches wide of the bottom right. Had that been on target, it was a goal; Lloris was rooted to the spot. Leipzig are getting closer and closer. 16 min: An awful lot of space for Werner down the left. He nearly frees the overlapping Sabitzer with a cute pass, but Sanchez reads play and pokes out for a corner. From which ... 14 min: Ampadu sprays a pass wide left for Angelino, who hits a first-time volleyed cross down the corridor of uncertainty. Nobody in black, red and blue dashes has taken a gamble, and there are no scares for Spurs. 12 min: Laimer tries to send Werner clear down the left. The striker\u2019s in space, but the pass is poor and sails out harmlessly for a goal kick. Spurs try to counter, but Bergwijn is clipped from behind by Sabitzer, and it\u2019s now one yellow card apiece. There\u2019s little sense that this fast, open game will end goalless, and it might not end with a full complement of players either. 10 min: Lo Celso is booked for a late trip on Sabitzer, who was hoping to burst off down the left. The Spurs man doesn\u2019t bother complaining, he was bang to rights. A long evening on a yellow, one poor challenge away from an early shower, stretches out ahead. 9 min: Angelino dinks a little pass down the inside left for Schick, who whistles a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris is behind it all the way. 8 min: Perhaps the best form of defence is attack. Lo Celso slips a ball down the left that forces Mukiele into conceding a corner. The set piece is only half cleared, but Spurs come back again down the left, Lo Celso finding Bergwijn, who curls towards the bottom right. Gulacsi sticks out a strong hand, and the flag goes up for offside. But that\u2019s better from the home side. Somewhere, in a parallel universe, it\u2019s 1-1. 6 min: Mukiele drives down the right and finds Werner on the edge of the box. Winks throws himself in the way of a shot. Great block, but once again Leipzig opened Spurs up with ease, and Spurs surely can\u2019t keep making last-ditch blocks and saves all night. 4 min: Such an electric start by the visitors. Four efforts on goal within the first 120 seconds. Three of them very decent chances. Some decent last-ditch defending by Spurs, but that\u2019ll have rattled them. Leipzig coming at them from all angles. 2 min: What a start this is by Leipzig! Werner\u2019s snap effort from six yards is blocked by Sanchez. The ball breaks left to Angelino, who hammers a shot straight at Lloris from a tight angle. Lloris deflects the ball onto the post and away. The visitors recycle possession, Mukiele and Werner buzzing down the inside right and forcing Lloris to turn the ball around the post. The flag goes up for offside to release the pressure. But wow. And we\u2019re off! Leipzig get the first leg of this round-of-16 tie underway. A huge roar crackles the north London air. And after 26 seconds, Schick juggles the ball down the middle and sends a decent effort bouncing inches wide of the right-hand post. The teams are out! A cracking Champions League atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs wear their famous lilywhite, while Leipzig sport their bespoke European away shirt, a cascade of black, red and blue dabs and dashes that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Claude Monet\u2019s garden. In other shirt news, Harry Kane has presented Hannah and Danny Greaves, granddaughter and son of the absurdly brilliant former Spurs striker Jimmy, with a Spurs top to celebrate the living legend\u2019s 80th birthday tomorrow. On the back: GREAVES 80. If you get a chance to watch the new BT Sport documentary about Greavsie, snatch it with both hands. A marvellous celebration of the greatest English striker of all time. Anyway, we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Julian \u2018Baby Mourinho\u2019 Nagelsmann, who at 32 is only 22 years older than the club he manages, talks to BT Sport. \u201cIt is the first time at this stage for Leipzig, so we are all excited. We are a young team, perhaps a bit nervous, but we will try to do our own style. It is a great stadium and it\u2019s a pleasure to be here. It is the same for Tottenham and Leipzig, we have injured players. But I think Ethan Ampadu will do well. This is not a tactical battle between the managers, it is about the players, the performance of the guys. The emotional things are the more important, if you can deal with the pressure.\u201d If Spurs win this evening, Jose Mourinho will break the all-time record for victories as a manager in the knockout stage of the Champions League. He\u2019s currently tied on 27 wins with Sir Alex Ferguson, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola. A 28th knockout victory will catapult him to the top of that particular tree, though of course Ancelotti has won the competition three times, as opposed to everyone else\u2019s two. Ancelotti also has two European Cup wins as a player to his name (Pep has one) so his medal haul knocks the other three into a cocked hat. A pre-match chat with Jose Mourinho. \u201cThis is a half-match. Too many matches in the knockout stage of the Champions League are thought of emotionally as one match. But this is only a half-match. So we need to be very intelligent in our approach, knowing what we have and what we don\u2019t have, and be positive with a good feeling. We are going to play against a team that normally play with five at the back, are very consistent and very fast. So I think a very difficult match. But we know what to do. Emotional control. It is not about fighting and running. We need to be clinical with our chances, but also knowing how to manage the game and the tempo. It is February, we are fighting for the top four, we are in the knockouts, and the last 16 of the FA Cup, so it is a big effort from the boys to be here. I think the crowd will be with them.\u201d Gedson Fernandes makes his Champions League debut for Spurs. His presence allows Giovani Lo Celso to move upfield in the space left by the injured Son Heung-min. Leipzig\u2019s defensive crisis means a start for Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea. One-time Everton striker Ademola Lookman is on the bench. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies, Winks, Fernandes, Lo Celso, Alli, Bergwijn, Lucas Moura. Subs: Vertonghen, Lamela, Dier, Gazzaniga, Ndombele, Skipp, Tanganga. RB Leipzig: Gulacsi, Mukiele, Klostermann, Halstenberg, Angelino, Laimer, Ampadu, Sabitzer, Nkunku, Schick, Werner. Subs: Haidara, Poulsen, Forsberg, Lookman, Wolf, Olmo, Mvogo. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). Only three teams have ever lifted the European Cup the season after tasting defeat in the final: Milan in 1994, Bayern Munich in 2013 and Liverpool last year. Three in 63 seasons; that\u2019s a one-in-21 hit rate. If history counts for anything, Tottenham Hotspur have their work cut out if they\u2019re to go one better than last season. On behalf of all Spurs fans: bah. But hold on! Spin it another way, and the feat has been achieved twice in the last seven seasons. It\u2019s far from a pipe dream in the modern game. So on behalf of all Spurs fans: yay! Mind you, the first knockout hurdle on the road to Istanbul looks a toughie. And not just because Spurs lost 7-2 the last time a German team came to N17, a mere four months ago. Bayern Munich, Tottenham\u2019s tormentors that horrific evening, are currently leading the Bundesliga, but they\u2019re being pursued all the way by tonight\u2019s visitors RB Leipzig. The club might only be celebrating its 11th birthday come May, but this is clearly a team capable of mixing it with the older boys. So you\u2019ll forgive Spurs, 137, if they feel a little trepidation tonight. It doesn\u2019t help that Spurs will be without their first-choice front line of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. But Leipzig have defensive worries: Dayot Upamecano is suspended while Ibrahima Konate and Willi Orban are out injured. Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea, may get a start as a result. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Throw in the fact that Leipzig have only won one of their last five in all competitions, while Spurs are three wins on the bounce, and we\u2019ve got ourselves a game. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
