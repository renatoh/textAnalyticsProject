Paul Harvey has managed to write one while living with dementia. With the help of the BBC Philharmonic, Four Notes \u2013 Paul\u2019s Tune sped to the top of the iTunes and Amazon charts last week \u2013 another high point in an extraordinary few weeks for the former music teacher. It began when his son Nick recorded him improvising a two-minute piece from four notes \u2013 F natural, A, D and B natural \u2013 and posted the footage on Twitter. After Radio 4\u2019s Broadcasting House featured the song, listeners suggested that it should be played by an orchestra, so the show\u2019s host, Paddy O\u2019Connell, arranged for the song to be recorded by the BBC Philharmonic. In the whirlwind of attention that has followed, the highlight for Paul was the chance to speak to composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim. \u201cThat was very special \u2013 I\u2019ve always been an incredible fan,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018I love your tune, I\u2019m going to steal it,\u2019 he said. He can have it all for nothing. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect all this fuss and palaver. Fortunately, because of my age, I\u2019m a bit laid-back about the whole thing, in the nicest possible way. Mind you, I wouldn\u2019t mind conducting the BBC Philharmonic \u2013 they were fantastic. I would love that.\u201d Dementia\u2019s cruelty is never far away though. There are times, his son says, when Paul cannot remember that he spoke to Sondheim, or play the tune that created the commotion. \u201cI asked him to play it again this afternoon and he couldn\u2019t remember it because it was an improvisation,\u201d Nick said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a composition. It wasn\u2019t something that he had crafted over days or hours. But because I captured it, it\u2019s now living, and it\u2019s become an entity, which is astonishing.\u201d Sitting at the keyboard, his forgetfulness disappears. \u201cMy memory\u2019s fine when I\u2019m playing the piano,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI can remember all the things I\u2019ve done. When I am looking at television or other things around where I live, then I start forgetting things. And if something is not in the right place, then I panic a bit. But if I\u2019m a bit stressed, I will go and play the piano, and I\u2019ll be alright then\u201d Music can help relieve depression, anxiety and other problems associated with dementia, according to professor Helen Odell-Miller, director of the Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research at Anglia Ruskin University. Even those in the most severe stages of the disease, who could not speak or dress themselves, could still improvise music, she said. Researchers believe music helps because it taps into memories of sounds that we hear as babies. Mothers were naturally musical when they interacted with their babies, so before they learned to understand words, they could understand their parents\u2019 expressions through rhythm, pitch and tempo, Odell-Miller said. \u201cIt is this natural hard-wired element of the brain and the social interactions and musical language that result and build up from this, which lead to procedural musical memories. \u201cThe start of a song triggers the memory of the whole song, which is owing to the natural pre-language flow of expression. Songs involve patterns and we learn to communicate through patterns and these patterns become embedded in our \u2018musical brain.\u2019\u201d Proceeds from the single are going to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society and Music for Dementia, which campaigns for people with the condition to have free access to music as part of their care. Grace Meadows, programme director for Music for Dementia, said music could also help people less naturally talented than Paul. \u201cIt is most effective when it\u2019s personalised and meaningful,\u201d she said. \u201cOur radio station, M4D Radio, has been developed to provide era-specific music for people living with dementia and their carers. It is particularly important now when so many other musical activities and services are on hold or no longer available due to Covid.\u201d Paul Harvey was born in Stoke-on-Trent and studied piano at the Guildhall School of Music. He became a composer \u2013 his Rumba Toccata is still used in grade 6 piano exams \u2013 and a concert pianist, appearing on the BBC Home Service in 1964, but decided to become a music teacher shortly before his eldest son Nick was born. He spent 20 years teaching at the Imberhorne school, a comprehensive in East Grinstead whose former pupils include Cutting Crew\u2019s Nick Van Eede, famous for his hit ballad (I just) Died in Your Arms. Five years ago, Paul moved into sheltered accommodation. \u201cThe moment we realised that something was awry properly when Ali, my wife, invited dad over for Sunday lunch and he arrived at 6am, looking flustered and confused,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThat was a turning point.\u201d There was a fall at home, then a 12-week hospital stay that prompted a cognitive decline. Occupational therapy, regular home care and a memory clinic have all played a part in slowing down dementia, but Nick said his father had often been depressed by his condition. Five weeks ago, it \u201cwasn\u2019t a great day\u201d, Nick said. Even piano wasn\u2019t helping much. \u201cI remembered this old party trick he used to do, where someone would give him four random notes and he\u2019d compose something on the spot. The first time I saw him do this was when I was nine, he was teaching at a summer school. I remember the pride I felt. \u201cSo I picked four notes out of the ether and dad did exactly the same thing. And luckily, I filmed it.\u201d Nick put the footage on Twitter, and \u201cit went crazy\u201d. Thousands of retweets later, the BBC Philharmonic musicians recorded their parts individually in their homes, and their performances were blended with the audio from Nick\u2019s original footage. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that his music deserves a large audience, and the fact that now, he is finally getting it \u2013 it fills my heart with joy,\u201d Nick said. \u201cFor those living with dementia, the ability to communicate is one of the last things to go. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this also applies to Dad and his improvising. Dementia won\u2019t be shutting him up for quite a while yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
