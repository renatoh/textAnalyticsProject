Dasaolu, who will compete for the first time this year in Saturday's Glasgow British Athletics International Match, has enjoyed an injury-free winter and says he intends to test himself against the world's elite more frequently. \"You get people who are one-season hit wonders but I want to continue what I did last year,\" he said. \"I went sub-10 and won medals for my country. I want to go more sub-10 on a more consistent basis and race more on the Diamond League circuit and race the best sprinters in the world.\" First, though, Dasaolu wants to put down a marker by having a strong indoor season. Last year he won silver at the European Indoor Championships, his first major medal for Britain, and be believes there is no reason why he cannot enjoy similar success at the world indoors in Sopot in March. \"Looking at indoors last year I was ranked No1 and picked up my first medal,\" he said. \"It gave me confidence in my coach, knowing that he had a good plan, and that I could produce on the bigger occasion. I now expect to pick up a medal at the world indoor championships and to build more on last year and keep the ball rolling.\" Dasaolu's camp has been joined over the winter by Adam Gemili, who became only the second British athlete after John Regis to go under 20 seconds, and Dasaolu believes that the pair are bringing out the best in each other. \"It is helping us to push each other,\" he said. \"We can see where the other person's at and we are challenging each other in training. You have to be at your best.\" During the off-season Dasaolu has been working on his start, which he believes was costing him last year. \"My coach Steve Fudge wasn't happy,\" said Dasaolu. \"He thought I was losing out in the first two steps. I need to be more responsive so I'm out of the blocks quicker. The indoors serves as a chance for me to see how the technical changes have affected my race.\" So how much quicker might that make him? \"We'll have to wait and see,\" concedes Dasaolu. \"But after my second full winter under Steve Fudge I'm fit and raring to go for the indoor season.\" The Sainsbury's Glasgow International Match will be live on BBC One from 1:45pm on Saturday 25 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
