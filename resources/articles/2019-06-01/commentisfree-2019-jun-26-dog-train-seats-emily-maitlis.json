He might have added a coda that the real source of bafflement and disgust is to be found in human behaviour around dogs. Take this week. Wanging round the internet has been a photograph of the BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis working on her laptop at a table on a GWR train with her pet whippet curled up peaceably on the seat beside her. \u201cNewsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis slammed for letting dog sleep on seat of packed train\u201d was the Daily Mirror\u2019s pretty representative headline. What\u2019s really telling is the slight fudging of the question of why she\u2019s being \u201cslammed\u201d. This is odd: your standard-issue tabloid attack headline does not usually hedge its bets. But it does here. The main emphasis is on the supposed rudeness of her taking up a seat on a crowded train, the implication being that Maitlis\u2019s spoiled pooch left pregnant women and frail oldies standing in the aisle for thrombosis-threatening hours. But the story doesn\u2019t at all support that. The photo shows an empty seat in the row behind Maitlis, and a quoted witness couldn\u2019t muster more than \u201csome people chose to stand, as there were few spare seats\u201d. And what sort of weirdo, instead of just saying: \u201cExcuse me, but could you move your dog so I can sit down?\u201d decides rather to photograph the sleeping dog, stand uncomfortably and resentfully all the way to their destination and then complain to the newspapers? No: the reason the story was framed this way is that the paper didn\u2019t dare baldly state the actual offence: which is that, no matter whether a train is full or empty, it\u2019s pretty disgusting to put a dog on a seat for humans. This would risk appearing anti-dog. Safer to go with the \u201cinconveniencing other passengers\u201d line (as a nation we love nothing more than standing in an aisle tut-tutting at the lady with a handbag on the seat beside her) than risk inflaming canine sentimentalists by implying the whippet didn\u2019t have as much right as any Newsnight presenter to be there. Dogs are pretty revolting creatures, even the nice ones. All of them fart. Most of them shed. Most of them dribble. Most of them hump stuff that isn\u2019t other dogs. Fleas, bum worms and God knows what else come as standard. And I\u2019ve never met a dog that, given the chance to roll in a freshly laid cat poo or a bit of fox scat, wouldn\u2019t leap on that chance with merry abandon. Who on earth wants to sit on a train seat after a dog? Not me. Not even after Emily Maitlis\u2019s dog, which looks as immaculately groomed as his owner and barely more likely than Maitlis herself to roll in fox poo when nobody\u2019s watching. Still, who knows? Best not take the chance with either of them. It\u2019s a much-noticed effect of the modern digital environment that it makes us more horrible to humans. A peculiar and perhaps compensatory side-effect has been that we now sentimentalise animals \u2013 dogs especially \u2013 to a quite horrible degree. Dogs are becoming standard in many workplaces; not just the ones where dead pheasants and such are in need of retrieving. Grown people post pictures of what they insist on calling \u201cdoggos\u201d \u2013 or, special yuk, \u201cgood big doggos\u201d \u2013 on social media. And when you meet their dogs in the flesh because, say, they gallop up to your picnic to eat your sausage rolls (\u201cSorry! Bless! He loves sausages!\u201d) or hump your children (\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be like that! He just wants to play!\u201d) you\u2019re expected to be charmed by them rather than revolted, angry or afraid. I find myself thinking wistfully of Michael Heseltine. You will find few stauncher supporters of Maitlis than me. She is learned, savvy, sensible and funny \u2013 she gives excellent interviews and absolutely outstanding side-eye. But I\u2019m afraid that with the dog-on-seat thing she has crossed a line and for her trespass must be immediately cancelled. \u2022 Sam Leith is literary editor of the Spectator"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
