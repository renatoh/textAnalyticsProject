This is simply not true. There were many pressures on German boys to join the Hitler Youth. But there was no compulsion. It is worth remembering that at the time of Ratzinger's membership, Pope Pius XII was known as Hitler's pope because of his fascist views. I was a member of the Hitler Youth for five years. A number of my friends had not joined up. Some found it difficult to enrol in the civil service and other state-run institutions. But I know of none of them having been punished in any way.
