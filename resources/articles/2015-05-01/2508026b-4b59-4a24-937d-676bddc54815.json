Febyanti Herewila, known as Feby, touched down on Saturday morning, after her husband of two days was executed in Indonesia on Wednesday. Less than a week after she wed Chan in his last hours on death row, Herewila has to face planning his funeral. She was escorted by government officials through a private exit at Sydney airport, along with Sukumaran\u2019s mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha. Looking tired, with hands on their bowed heads, the families made no comment leaving the airport before getting into three white cars that had been waiting for them. Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, were shot by a firing squad with six other drug offenders at 12.25am (local time) on Wednesday, 10 years after their part in the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling plot. A container believed to be carrying their bodies was escorted from the tarmac at Sydney airport about 6.30am on Saturday. Chan\u2019s brother Michael and mother Helen arrived back in Sydney on Friday. The Australian newspaper is reporting Indonesian president Joko Widodo ignored the advice of the vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, and the former general and presidential candidate, Prabowo Subianto, in not stopping the executions. Kalla was concerned about possible damage to Indonesia\u2019s reputation. Despite media reports, former Bali Nine lawyer Muhammad Rifan has not been arrested. \u201cIt\u2019s not true what Sky News said,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m OK. I\u2019m in my home in Bali. \u201cWhen I\u2019m scheduled for questioning, there will be a procedure for that.\u201d Mr Rifan represented Chan and Sukamaran when they were sentenced to death in 2006. He claims judges asked for more than $130,000 for a lighter sentence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
