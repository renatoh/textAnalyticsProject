The museum has sent a clarification saying that the \u00a325m actually comprises \u00a312.5m from Lord Sainsbury's Linbury Trust to be paid over the next three years, and \u00a312.5m from the Monument Trust established by John Sainsbury's late brother Simon (Be more like Sainsbury, UK rich urged, 13 September, page 9). \u2022\u2008Readers were surprised when a quote had the author of Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine, seemingly saying: \"These cultural lores [about male and female brains and minds]\u2026 are standing in the way of greater sex inequality.\" That was meant to be \"equality\" (Men are from Mars, women are from\u2026 Mars too? 11 September, page 3). \u2022 We were off beam in describing the Leslie Howard film 'Pimpernel' Smith as a tribute to Spitfire pilots. The homage to the Spitfire and its designer RJ Mitchell was The First of the Few (Reels show 1930s actor in a new light, 13 September, page 13). \u2022\u2008Our review of the final episode of ITV's Heartbeat said that we never find out if Alf, having been impaled on a pitchfork, pulls through. It was Oscar who fell foul of the agricultural implement (The weekend's TV, 13 September, page 25, G2). \u2022\u2008We described Stephen Green, HSBC's chairman, as a lay minister. Rather, he is an ordained Anglican priest (HSBC man Green chosen as trade minister after four-month search, 8 September, page 13)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
