Brownlee said he would have voted for Farah, who came fourth in the awards despite retaining his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m titles in style in Rio, and felt it was \u201creally sad\u201d that he did not get the respect his success deserved. \u201cFor me Mo\u2019s achievements are incredible and what stands out about them is that no one from this country has ever done them before,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cThere is a good chance that no one will again. It\u2019s not like someone does it every year \u2013 it is a complete one-off in what are two very competitive, blue riband athletic events.\u201d Brownlee, who finished in second place behind Andy Murray on Sunday night, said he was flabbergasted that Farah had finished in the top three of Spoty only once, in 2011. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s not in the top three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily help if you\u2019re not there on the night; maybe some people don\u2019t see him as British. He trains abroad, too. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad, because for me he is the perfect British story. It\u2019s what we should be about: a person who comes to Britain as a young man, as a refugee, and an ex\u2011schoolteacher identifies something that he\u2019s brilliant at and he represents Britain as the best in the world. I think that\u2019s a fantastic British story.\u201d Farah\u2019s case was also supported by the 58-year-old showjumper Nick Skelton, another gold medallist in Rio, who finished third on Sunday night. \u201cI think I would have voted for Mo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done is amazing, hard work and flogging his body. To win all those double golds he\u2019s a worthy winner of it.\u201d Meanwhile Murray has conceded it will be hard to maintain his level of tennis after a brilliant 2016, during which he won Wimbledon, Olympic gold and reached the world No1 spot for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that everything doesn\u2019t go perfectly next year,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to be able to deal with that. I know that to stay at the top and keep winning big titles, it\u2019s a really difficult thing to do. I\u2019m trying to prepare myself for that mentally a little bit just now. \u201cBetween my last grand slam and now must be nearly four years or something so I\u2019m not taking anything for granted. I\u2019m expecting it to be really hard and that\u2019s why I need to keep improving, working hard and finding ways to make my game better.\u201d Murray said he would have voted for Brownlee, adding that the Yorkshireman deserved the award for winning gold in Rio and then helping his brother Jonny cross the line in a world triathlon series race in Mexico while he was suffering from heatstroke. \u201cWhat he did early in the year was an amazing achievement anyway,\u201d the Scot said. \u201cBut what he did with his brother gave a really important message. It showed that sport is not only about winning. I think sometimes that gets lost. \u201cEveryone has to win all of the time but there\u2019s always losers as well. Especially at the end of such a difficult and physically challenging, brutal competition that they are in, for him to slow down and help his brother over the line was a really important thing to do. It was great to see.\u201d Michael Phelps, who won the Sport Personality lifetime achievement award on Sunday, said he had been impressed by Britain\u2019s 100m breaststroke Olympic champion Adam Peaty \u2013 and particularly his world-record performance in Rio. \u201cI am really happy I was not racing against him, given he had such a dominant performance as he had,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cI said to Ian Thorpe that Peaty swam a 56.4 or 56.5 whatever it was \u2013 that is one of the grossest swims I have ever seen. \u201cWhen you go 56 in breaststroke \u2013 are you kidding me? I am excited to watch him going forward. And I would love to see him swim a 200m. I don\u2019t know if he will but it will be kind of fun to watch him do that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
