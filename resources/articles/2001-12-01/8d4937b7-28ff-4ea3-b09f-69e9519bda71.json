Early police reports said that at least 50 people were injured, some seriously, and 50 others were trapped beneath the rubble after part of the roof of the Kolonnade shopping centre, just north of the city, collapsed onto the ice rink. The South African Press Association said the trapped included an 8-month-old baby. A spokeswoman for the shopping centre said that 21 people had been injured and that there were no fatalities. She also said that there was no one still trapped under the rubble. Ambulances rushed to the scene, along with police and military helicopters. About 300 police and soldiers joined the rescue effort. Authorities said it would take hours to dig everyone out of the rubble. \"We heard a major loud bang ... we saw people there running out,\" Shiraz Osman, a witness, told independent radio station 702. The station said more sections of the first floor of the shopping centre have collapsed since the rescue effort began. Parents and other family members gathered outside the centre, waiting for word of loved ones trapped beneath chunks of concrete and other rubble that buried the skating rink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
