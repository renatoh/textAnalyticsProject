Centuries later, the first chapter of Norman England was recorded in the Domesday Book. Taxing, conscripting and a desire to show off the state's reach lay behind such early efforts, and the same impulses combined with Malthusian panic to trigger the headcount of 1801 \u2013 a count which became the census we know today. Once a tool of subjugation and aggrandisement, the census evolved into an instrument to plan public services, as well as becoming the definitive log of the changing social currents of creed, family and work. Or, at least, a fairly definitive source: the 2001 debacle which saw Jedi Knight put on the census keepers' list of religions revealed that knocking on every door does not always get at the truth. But a comprehensive count gets much closer to it than any random sample. All sorts of data is calibrated back to the census, and so there is a head-spinning circularity to Whitehall's plans to make next year's headcount the last and distil future population estimates from other sources. Given its \u00a3400m price tag, neither the census's power in tracing family roots nor its unique utility to social scientists will carry the day. Perhaps brute politics might. The coalition plans to abolish a slew of Labour seats by equalising constituency size \u2013 on the basis of next year's census. This exercise should surely convince it that counting still counts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
