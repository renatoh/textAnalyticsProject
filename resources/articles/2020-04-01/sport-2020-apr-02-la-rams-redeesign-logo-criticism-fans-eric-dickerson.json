With the rest of the sports world effectively shut down, the Los Angeles Rams decided that it was the ideal time to launch their updated logo. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t take into account that sports fans were desperate for anything to distract them from the nonstop glut of doom-and-gloom that currently makes up the rest of the news. The launch was met with a barrage of ridicule, much of it coming from their own fanbase, and the negative reaction could send the team back to the literal drawing board. Why did the Rams feel the need to change the logo at all? Well, the Rams are still working on finding their own identity \u2013 and a market \u2013 following their return to Los Angeles after spending 21 seasons as the St Louis Rams. They will also be playing at a new home, SoFi Stadium, next season (Covid-19 permitting), which makes it the ideal time for them to rebrand. Also, let\u2019s not ignore the fact that a new logo means an opportunity to sell truckloads of updated merchandise at a premium. In the NFL, money is a contributing factor in nearly every decision. So, when did things start to go wrong? Almost immediately. First, images of a Rams hat made by New Era for the upcoming draft leaked online to near-universal disgust. At the time, the Rams claimed that this was a rejected design and echoed the opinions of their fans. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hat I would buy or we would ever want in the marketplace,\u201d said Kevin Demoff, chief operating officer of the Rams, adding that it \u201cwas a terrible introduction to where we are headed, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about how that came to be.\u201d I assume things got worse\u2026 They did. On 23 March, the Rams officially debuted their new colors and logo: gone were the navy blue and light gold, replaced by royal blue and solid gold. The updated logo featured a white \u201cLA\u201d superimposed on a blue background with the added twist that the capital \u201cA\u201d was growing what was supposed to be a golden ram\u2019s horn. The colors weren\u2019t so much the issue, it was the logo that became the target of, essentially, the entire sports world for the next few hours. Was the logo really that bad? It could be argued that the mockery was disproportionate to the flaws. It was likely that any redesign would have been doomed to a round of jokes because there wasn\u2019t much else going on in the sports world at the time. With that being said, yes it was pretty darn bad, especially since the \u201chorns\u201d of the logo looked exactly like a capital \u201cC,\u201d which made the whole thing look, at first glance, like a logo for the Los Angeles Chargers. The number one goal of any logo should be to avoid making you look like you\u2019re playing for a different team. And it\u2019s even worse when that team happens to be your cross-city rivals in a market many don\u2019t think can support two franchises in the first place. What were some of the other criticisms of the logo? Numerous people made the not-inaccurate claim that it looked like \u201ca morning news logo.\u201d SB Nation commemorated it with a headline that called it an \u201cawful Dollar Tree-ass logo.\u201d Eric Dickerson commented, \u201csomeone said it looked like a penis. It did.\u201d Wait, doesn\u2019t Eric Dickerson work for the Rams? He does! The former Rams star running-back is the team\u2019s vice president of business development and he does not care for the new logo. In response, Dickerson posted that he \u201creviewed your comments regarding our new logos and share in your disappointment. I\u2019ll be speaking with the teams on our behalf.\u201d He also shared an alternate design created by a Rams booster club. Was there any response from Demoff? Well, you can\u2019t say that he\u2019s unaware of the fan response. In fact, he claimed that if the Rams raise more than $2m in a virtual telethon for coronavirus relief, he would read the top 10 mean tweets made about the redesign. They eventually raised $2,045,000, so one would guess that this is forthcoming. Will the team keep the logo? We\u2019ll see. While there is already an online petition to force the team to change the logo, Demoff seems confident that fans will simply get used to it: \u201cI think it\u2019s a change that our fans will come to know and love over time.\u201d He may be correct. There is a backlash nearly every time a team makes a bold change and fans usually adjust. Heck, even Gritty was met with derision when introduced and he\u2019s become one of the most beloved mascots in sports. (Note: this may be because there are very few mascots who are tolerated, let alone \u201cbeloved,\u201d but nevertheless the preceding sentence is at least technically true.) Is there anything positive to come out of this whole debacle for the Rams? What\u2019s the old Oscar Wilde saying about the only worse thing than being talked about? Since the move to Los Angeles, the Rams have been rather anonymous, which is quite a feat considering that they made the Super Bowl just last year (although, given everything that\u2019s happened since, it does feel like decades ago). While playing in a new stadium may change their fortunes, they have had issues with opposing teams\u2019 fans crowding out their own. For one day, they were the biggest topic in sports. So what if it wasn\u2019t for anything football related? At this point, they\u2019ll take it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
