Old Trafford season-ticket holders understand that better than most yet on Sunday afternoon they still chanted \"Fergie, Fergie, sign him up\". That endorsement of Carlos Tevez was something on which they could focus during the 2-0 victory over a vapid Manchester City. Ferguson's comment contrived to be both polite and, implicitly, withering. \"The fans love a trier,\" he remarked. \"A lad who tries a lot can be forgiven a lot.\" There was a subtle rebuke of supporters who imagine they know best and also an allusion to the striker's limitations. Tevez must have caused displeasure with the comments about his estrangement and the likelihood that he would be at another club next season. The situation, however, is more complicated than these declarations imply. There is a lot of bluffing to be done before the Argentinian's future is resolved.United have already committed themselves to spending a total of \u00a310m to hire Tevez for this season and last. Another \u00a322m is due to MSI, who hold his registration, if the move is to become permanent. It looks clear, yet late last year there were references from Old Trafford to the complexity of negotiations. In theory there was nothing to discuss since the specifics of a deal had already been agreed. United, however, are evidently insistent now that the terms have to be more attractive. The manoeuvring was evident when United's stance was tested by reports of an alienated Tevez being sought by Real Madrid, Internazionale and Liverpool. Ferguson is surely seeking to haggle his way towards retaining the attacker. Proprietors such as the Glazers will query the MSI valuation. Having scored 14 goals in the Premier League last season, Tevez has just four so far this time. Complaints from the player about feeling alienated are not completely melodramatic. A footballer of his standing would have seethed to realise that he had twice been an unused substitute against Chelsea in this Premier League campaign. Then again, Ferguson has turned to him in the matches against Liverpool. What is more, Tevez started in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final with Arsenal. He has not so much been sent into exile as asked to move over and allow Dimitar Berbatov to make his mark in a debut season at United. That will not prevent Ferguson from preferring Tevez to the newcomer here and there. The Argentinian may have undermined himself with an over-eagerness to demonstrate his work-rate. When he simply scurries, Tevez is no more than a pastiche of Wayne Rooney. Against City he remembered to collect himself and hit the post with two marvellous drives, the second of which went into the net. His contribution was that of a person resolved to stay where he is. There was none of the ostentatious dejection footballers exude when aiming to catch the eye of other clubs. On the face of it there is no sound logic in wriggling to free himself from United, Champions League finalists who have their berth in this year's final. Ambivalence in Ferguson's mind will stem purely from his professional restlessness. He has always been open to change and without that trait could not have lasted so long at Old Trafford. There is an obligation that is pressing upon him far sooner than anticipated. The 17-year-old Federico Macheda scored the winner in the first two of his three Premier League outings to date. There is no better way to get a manager's attention. It would be natural to instruct the Italian to be patient, but Ferguson must recall that Gerard Piqu\u00e9, in similar circumstances, preferred to head back to Barcelona. He will be facing United instead of aiding them in that Champions League final. These are the sort of issues that Ferguson has to keep in balance. Indeed, he could have foreseen the dilemmas to come when he moved for Berbatov. The Bulgarian is so refined that his contribution is well-nigh invisible at times, but the forward embodies a detached delicacy, as he did when setting up Tevez for his goal on Sunday. The manager believes Berbatov brings another dimension to United. If Tevez appreciates that there is currently nowhere better for him to perform then some sort of arrangement will be reached. United's bargaining position is strong. They could flourish without Tevez, but he might dread what he was doing to his career by walking out on Old Trafford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
