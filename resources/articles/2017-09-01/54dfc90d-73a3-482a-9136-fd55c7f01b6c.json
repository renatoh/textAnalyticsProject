Stoke were undone at Ashton Gate by two goals in 10 second-half minutes from Famara Di\u00e9dhiou and Matt Taylor, following Burnley \u2013 beaten in a penalty shootout by Leeds \u2013 in bowing out in the third round to a Championship side. Mark Hughes had no complaints though. \u201cWe were poor and they played very well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have a good season playing like that, but we have to be much better. I am very disappointed because this is a competition we wanted to do well in. Maybe I got the changes wrong, but I was expecting a lot more from my players. I know we will be better against Chelsea on Saturday, but that isn\u2019t much consolation at the moment.\u201d Swansea City did make it into the last 16 as Alfie Mawson and Jordan Ayew struck in the second half of their 2-0 success at Reading. Afterwards Paul Clement hailed the development of the 23-year-old Mawson.\u201cI think he\u2019s really maturing,\u201d said the Swansea manager. \u201cHe looks physically strong, he dealt with a lot of situations by reading the game well. He\u2019s very dangerous in the opposing box, he\u2019s good on the ball and he\u2019s part of that defensive unit that are doing very well at the moment.\u201d Bournemouth claimed a home victory over Brighton for the second time in five days as the Norway international Josh King steered in a winner nine minutes into extra time, leaving Eddie Howe delighted. \u201cJosh is off the mark now and Jermain Defoe got off the mark on Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for them and good for us. Confidence is important for your strikers.\u201d Elsewhere, Leicester City won 2-0 at home to Liverpool, West Ham beat Bolton 3-0, while 1-0 was sufficient for Tottenham at home to Barnsley and Crystal Palace against Huddersfield. The second-half dismissal of Aston Villa\u2019s captain, Tommy Elphick was the turning point of his side\u2019s game, with Middlesbrough winning 2-0 at Villa Park thanks to two goals from Patrick Bamford. Elphick was shown a second yellow card by Stephen Martin after a clumsy challenge on Bamford, who dispatched the resulting penalty after 58 minutes. The defender had been booked in the first half for a late tackle on George Friend Bamford\u2019s header eight minutes later sealed the game but Villa\u2019s manager, Steve Bruce, felt that Elphick\u2019s header early in the game from a Henri Lansbury free-kick should not have been ruled out for offside. \u201cIt was a red card, I\u2019m not disputing that, but the goal he scored was onside. It shouldn\u2019t have been chalked off. You could say it wasn\u2019t the best of evenings for Tommy and the sending-off was the turning point.\u201d Villa suffered a first home defeat of the season with Bruce fielding a raw-looking side, with none of the starting lineup having begun the Championship game at Barnsley three days earlier. Many of Villa\u2019s supporters had shunned the game too, with only 11,197 showing up. \u201cWe have a huge week ahead with three games, that\u2019s why I left out 11 players,\u201d Bruce added. \u201cI wanted to keep players fresh but we\u2019re all disappointed to have gone out and if the linesman had done his job properly we could still be in the competition.\u201d Garry Monk, the Middlesbrough manager, said: \u201cThe whole team performed well and we dominated from start to finish.\u201d Bristol Rovers, the only League One club involved on Tuesday night, went out at Wolves thanks to Bright Enobakhare\u2019s 98th-minute winner during an extra-time period in which Tom Lockyer was dismissed for the visitors. Mario Vrancic\u2019s first two goals for Norwich helped them to a comfortable 3-1 win at Brentford, with Josh Murphy scoring their third at Griffin Park, although Brentford\u2019s Yoann Barbet missed a penalty when they were losing 1-0. Brentford did eventually score but Josh Clarke\u2019s goal came in injury time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
