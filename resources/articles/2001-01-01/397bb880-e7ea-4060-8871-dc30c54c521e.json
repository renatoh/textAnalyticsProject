Auckland is just another big city and not at all representative of the rest of the country, especially the South Island, so don't be disheartened. Having been in New Zealand this time last year, I know all about the 'interesting weather' you can get (including the four days we spent stranded in Queenstown after a week of non-stop, Biblical-standard rain flooded the town and closed all the roads out), but the South Island makes it all worth it. Shame you missed Tongariro, as it is everything it's cracked up to be, but ATNP should make up for it, being, in my humble opinion, possibly the most wonderful place on earth. As much as I hate fellow travellers who say 'you must do this', I'm going to do so myself, so apologies now. Before you leave NZ, you really must: 1 Climb Mount Roy, which is just outside Wanaka, for views over the Remarkables, Lakes Wanaka and Hawea and the Southern Alps that will stay with you for the rest of your days (prepare well, though - it's a good three hour walk up, so take lots of water). 2 Camp (at the YHA) next to the bright blue waters of Lake Tekapo, and walk up neighbouring Mount John. 3 Stay at Hilltop in Paptowai, down in the Catlins - stunning views, lovely people (who'll take you boogie boarding if you ask nicely). 4 Take a helicopter flight round the peaks of Mts Cook &amp; Tasman from Fox Glacier - another truly unforgettable experience. 5 Eat a pumpkin and chocolate muffin at the Christchurch Arts Centre's Boulevard Bakehouse - admittedly, not an adrenalin-related activity, but very good for the soul while the world passes by. Hope that your South Island experience turns out to be as wonderful as ours was. Best wishes for the rest of your travels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
