In his autobiography he refers only to \"v*******e\", as if it were the worst insult known to man. \"People think it means you can do a lot of things but you can't actually do any of them well,\" he has said. No wonder a crowd gathered around him yesterday then, eager to hear his views on playing in the unaccustomed role of full-back for England against Wales on Saturday. How many games have you played in that shirt, someone asked. \"What, this one?\" he replied, quick as a flash, pointing to his short-sleeved training top. On being informed of his new role his response, according to Clive Woodward, was: \"Am I captain as well?\" If the Welsh are anticipating a pale, quivering wreck under Saturday's first high ball, they will be seriously disappointed. There is rather more chance that Healey will make a spectacular success of the job, for the time has come to portray him for what he is, not just as an international-class wind-up merchant and spiky Guardian diarist but as a talented, experienced, multi-skilled breath of fresh air who will be winning his 46th England cap. If he really were a mediocre jack of all trades he would never have got close to that number, let alone represented his country in every back-line position. For his own sake, as well as Woodward's, whose patience on the subject of rookie full-backs is wearing increasingly thin, a few myths need to be nailed. The first is the role of the modern Test No15. As Woodward testily reminded his audience yesterday, Jason Robinson should already have dynamited most people's preconceptions and Healey feels the same way. \"Maybe 10 years ago it would have been a big task but now we've got two huge fast wingers, so it'll be more of a unit than set positions anyway,\" he said. \"You'll find Benny Cohen or Luges [Dan Luger] will be back at certain times and I'll be up in the line. I've just got to go out and try and be as exciting as Jason. We're both roughly the same size, so hopefully I can duck under as many tackles as he does.\" The England management also feel Healey's wing duties meant they missed his influence closer to the rucks in Paris and Woodward argues that playing him at full-back will actually make it easier to move him forward when the need arises. Self-evidently he is talking about a key figure, not a v*******e fringe member, a point reinforced on the training ground yesterday. There are a number of England players whose clubs have not been going well recently and a degree of post-Paris gloom hung in the air until Healey intervened. \"Austin made a good comment,\" revealed Will Greenwood. \"He said: 'You can still bloody smile in an England shirt, we're still the same blokes we were before the French game. We're going to enjoy playing rugby, we want the ball in our hand. Don't be down for the sake of being down. Yeah, identify where we've gone wrong but let's not forget when it goes right we can play some good stuff and don't lose the smile.'\" Churchill would have been proud. Becoming a father for the first time also appears to have sharpened the 28-year-old Healey's professional appetite. \"There were a lot of players sat there when Clive was naming the team thinking: 'Am I going to be in it?' A lot of players were saying they had not felt that nervous for some time, which I think is a good thing. \"There's definitely a feeling we let ourselves down against France. I think everyone's a bit on edge. Everybody hates losing, especially when you've just been described as the world's No1 team. Losing does motivate you and we want to bounce back.\" It is also clear, looking further ahead, that the 2003 World Cup is exerting its pull. \"Next year my work-rate will be twice as much as it is this year and it will be for every England player. This is almost the calm before the storm. You have to build up the courage to put yourself through what you're going to have to do next year. The British rowing four at the Olympics wanted to train so well that even on a bad day they would win. A World Cup-winning team is the team who wins on those sort of days.\" Healey will be there, no doubt, telling us tight-head prop has always been his best position. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
