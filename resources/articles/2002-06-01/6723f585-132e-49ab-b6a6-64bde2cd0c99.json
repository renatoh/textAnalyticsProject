Within seconds of the van appearing a piercing, crackly voice will start hollering through the loudspeaker mounted on its roof. It will scream about the prowess of the Japanese nation and how the country was treated unfairly after the second world war while encouraging all Japanese to work towards making the nation great and powerful. Given Japan's sorry exit from the World Cup you might be forgiven for thinking that this is a ploy by the country's football association to try and help the country overcome the blues. But the worrying thing for the health of one's ear drums is that the black vans are a common feature in Tokyo and have become the main method by which rightwing Japanese nationalists attempt to spread their views on the superiority of their nation. Over the past few weeks, however, the noise from the black vans has been drowned out by the screams and cheers of Japanese football fans as thousands of the team's followers have taken the opportunity to let their hair down and challenge the constraints of their conservative society. These have been the best of times and the worst of times in Japan; best because of the team's relative success, worst because, believe it or not, there has been hooliganism Japanese-style. The behaviour of the team's supporters has been one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of this tournament. We all know that the Koreans can party and are football crazy but nobody was quite sure what to expect from the Japanese. This is a country, after all, where order, decorum and protocol are crucial cultural values - not the attributes normally required to put on a wild World Cup party. If you were looking for action in a stadium in Japan when the Japanese were playing then you had best forget it; the most advisable course of action would have been to catch a flight to Korea. Indeed, it was amazing that Japan fans found any time to watch the game given that they spent so much of every match taking photographs or speaking on mobile phones. One fan I sat next to was carrying more equipment than David Bailey and when he wasn't taking pictures with one of three sophisticated lenses he was taking them with his mobile phone. To add to the impression of peculiar behaviour, even a shot that was heading 30 yards wide or high was met with such loud shrills they almost set off a panic attack for fear that the black van men had arrived. Playing in only their second World Cup, Japan has been a team with only one song. \"Nippon, Nippon,\" chanted the fans as they politely clapped their hands and stayed in their seats. Contrast this with the frenzied scenes in Korea, where two supporters died of heart attacks in the stadium after the team's victory over Italy. Away from the stadiums, however, it has been a different story. It is here that the new Japan has been on show and the young in particular have taken the opportunity to party and break loose. They threw themselves off the Dotumburi bridge in Osaka when Japan qualified for the second round, hundreds jostling and pushing in an attempt to make the 30 feet drop into the river below. Inevitably, this was accompanied by more of the same shrill screaming. On Tuesday they threw themselves off the bridge again, this time to mark their team's elimination from the competition. As for the hooligans, the Japan fans that have been arrested would hardly qualify for category C, the classification British police use for the most hardened troublemakers. Eight people were arrested for exposing themselves, half of them when the team beat Russia to qualify for the second round and the other half when they were knocked out by Turkey. Outside the Osaka stadium there were two reported thefts when fans without tickets snatched the same from two teenage girls. In Tokyo, a phone box was smashed after Japan's World Cup exit while four drunken locals mourning the same event were arrested by police after they crossed the road when they should not have done so. Privately, conservative elements in Japanese society must be breathing a sigh of relief that the national team's World Cup is over. Japanese youngsters now have nothing to be rowdy about, everybody can cross the road at the same time, the nation's phone boxes will remain intact and, with business as usual, it will be over to the men in the black vans again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
