You didn\u2019t have to delve too deeply to understand that the split was not terribly amicable. Cowell took to the tabloids, protesting the band\u2019s lack of due deference. \u201cWhy do artists think they\u2019re more important than staff members? They\u2019re not,\u201d he wailed, indicating precisely why artists might not want to hang around Syco too long. Freed from pop\u2019s dark overlord, Little Mix proceeded to launch their own TV talent show, The Search, a direct competitor to Cowell\u2019s ailing X Factor. The ratings suggested the public might be sick of TV talent shows regardless of who\u2019s on the judging panel, but you couldn\u2019t knock it as an act of aggression \u2013 the light entertainment equivalent of tanks on the lawn. Now their first post-Cowell album arrives, heralded by a single that snaps: \u201cI don\u2019t do what Simon says.\u201d \u201cBe a puppet on a string,\u201d runs Not a Pop Song; \u201cWorks for you, but not for me.\u201d The chorus, meanwhile, is designed to be bellowed along to en masse in arenas illuminated by frantically waved glow sticks and rent with screams: \u201cAnything is better than another pop song about falling in love, but if you wanna sing along, say, \u2018I don\u2019t give a what\u2019.\u201d This is fine, rollicking stuff \u2013 criticism of the manufactured pop industry is always more piquant when it comes from within \u2013 that sets the listener up for a new era in the career of Britain\u2019s most successful girl band: unleashed from shadowy controlling influences, able to do, and indeed sing about, whatever they want. The problem with Confetti is that it suggests that what Little Mix want to do in their new, unleashed state isn\u2019t particularly different from what they did when they were, as Not a Pop Song puts it, \u201chamster[s] on a wheel\u201d. You\u2019d be hard pushed to differentiate it from its predecessor, save for the fact that LM5 seemed overly concerned with bolstering Little Mix\u2019s waning fortunes in the US: this time out, there are no guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, and the vocals seem less intent on mimicking the slurred delivery of a mumble rapper. Otherwise, it\u2019s business as usual. The sound frequently feels like a box-ticking exercise in current pop trends: 80s-inspired, Boys of Summer synths on Break-Up Song; reggaeton beat on Sweet Melody; post-Daft Punk house on Holiday; gospel-ish piano balladry on My Love Won\u2019t Let You Down; vocals cling-filmed in Auto-Tune throughout. It\u2019s all very well done without ever quite reaching the heights of their best singles, Black Magic and Shout Out to My Ex, two spectacular examples of the songwriter-for-hire\u2019s craft. Sweet Melody stands out, its faintly irritating vocal hook overwhelmed by its dirt-dishing lyrics about fellow pop star ex-boyfriends (\u201cHe would lie, he would cheat, over a syncopated beat\u201d), while the Europop melody of Happiness skilfully stays the just right side of cheesy. Nevertheless, it\u2019s quite odd listening to Not a Pop Song\u2019s bold announcement that there will be \u201cno more singing songs about breaking my heart and my lonely nights dancing in the dark\u201d in the middle of an album packed with songs about broken hearts (\u201cMy baby don\u2019t love me no more and it hurts like hell,\u201d complains Breathe) and which literally opens with a song about a lonely night spent dancing in the dark: \u201cI\u2019ve found a way to dance without you \u2013 in the middle of the crowd I forget about the pain inside.\u201d The sense of a band keen to have their cake and eat it is ameliorated when the album\u2019s production steps lightly into more adventurous territory. The clattering rhythm track of Gloves Up recalls the experimentation found in early 00s R&amp;B; A Mess (Happy 4 U) strikes the perfect balance between melodic pop sugar rush and sonic invention, shifting after two minutes into a dark cloud of sampled panting, booming drums and distorted vocals. Maybe Not a Pop Song is talking about the future, rather than the here and now: it isn\u2019t inconceivable that Little Mix, whose members have been vocal about issues ranging from racism to online bullying and mental health, might shift their focus as promised, although it\u2019s probably best not to hold your breath. As it is, Confetti is exactly what you would expect from the band: a solid mainstream pop album \u2013 even when it\u2019s claiming that it isn\u2019t. This week Alexis listened to Rheinzand: Porque Missed at the time, spotted on a best-of-2020 list online: unclassifiable electronic pop from Belgium with violin and Spanish vocals.
