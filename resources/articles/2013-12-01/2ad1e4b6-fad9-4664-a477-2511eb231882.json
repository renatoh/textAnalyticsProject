The incendiary device went off around 6.40pm in the Cornmarket district. Army bomb disposal officers have been called into the area and the police have sealed it off. No one was injured in the blast, but the Police Service of Northern Ireland have advised other city centre businesses to check their premises. Tonight's attack is the third bombing in the city centre over the last few weeks. On Friday night, the republican terror group \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann placed a bomb inside a holdall outside a restaraunt in the Cathedral district of the city. Several senior PSNI officers were enjoying a Christmas party nearby when the device partially exploded. On 24 November, the ONH forced a north Belfast man to drive a car with a bomb inside it to the Victoria Square shopping centre. After he ran from his vehicle and alerted the police, the bomb again partially exploded. Alban Maginness, SDLP assembly member for North Belfast and the party's justice spokesman, condemned those behind the bomb. He said: \"It beggars belief that following the placing of a bomb in the Cathedral Quarter on Friday night that Belfast would be faced with yet another attempted act of wanton destruction. \"To place an incendiary device in a busy shopping area is both reckless and irresponsible and serves no rational purpose. Those behind this incendiary device are anti-Belfast and just want to threaten jobs, livelihoods and people's enjoyment of our city. \"They must not be permitted to prevail. Anyone with any information, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant the detail, must contact the police as a matter of urgency.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
