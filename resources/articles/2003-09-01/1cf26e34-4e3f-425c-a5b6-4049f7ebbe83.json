There were times during New York fashion week when I was supremely grateful for this small mercy. I realise that, as newspaper assignments go, covering New York fashion week doesn't sound exactly arduous: we fashion journalists live a sheltered life and attract little sympathy with our whingeing about stiletto blisters and warm champagne. None the less, the Betsey Johnson show this week was the nearest thing to torture that I have ever endured. I have seen some bad fashion shows, but this was truly terrible. Picture the scene: on to the catwalk step four models in nylon French maid outfits and high heels, carrying empty magnums of Taittinger (I assume they are empty, since these feeble creatures don't look strong enough to pick up a full one between them). Their faces are so gaunt that their scarlet-lipsticked smiles are deathly creepy. They are trying desperately hard to strut sexily to the music, but for some reason none of them seems to be able to hear the bass, and so they judder along clumsily like deaf aunties dancing at a wedding. At this point I actually catch myself feeling moral outrage, in the manner of a Daily Mail reader. Eventually they retreat but, amazingly, the outfits get worse. There is a frilly lemon-yellow romper suit, the kind worn by babies, but on a stiletto-clad grown woman, and cut to expose half her buttocks. There is a negligee that bears the legend, Hand Job. Weirdest of all, when this witless display mercifully ends, the audience roars with applause. After that, it couldn't get any worse. And in all fairness, I did get to see some nice clothes. Primarily, inevitably, by Marc Jacobs, who is New York's finest when it comes to tuning in to what modern women actually want to wear. Both his slightly mannish, Lauren Hutton-esque daywear (slouchy seersucker trousers with high heels and a shirt or shell top) and his dressy-but-not-pompous eveningwear were surefire hits. DKNY's collection was billed as the perfect wardrobe for a New York to LA road trip, and the look - minis and vests, easy dresses, neutrals punctuated by neons - struck a chord with the audience. Narciso Rodriguez channelled the spirit of the retiring Calvin Klein into impeccably cut black, white and taupe separates for the chic (and rich and skinny) Manhattan woman. Proenza Schouler, the new darlings of Manhattan fashion (and, according to the rumour mill, the latest talent to be hired to design behind the scenes at Maxmara) showed that they can create both flattering trousers and stunning dresses, a combination that should serve them well. The Roaring 20s theme of the week produced fabulous dresses at Diane von Furstenberg and Carolina Herrera, if you happen to find yourself in the market for a once-in-a-lifetime gown next spring. But that's where the good news ends. Too much of New York fashion seems stuck in a groove, without the gumption to move on. London fashion gets a bad press - the old one-legged-trouser complaint - but at least the designers seem interested in making original clothes, however misguided they may be in the notion that anyone wants to wear them. In New York, it was depressing to find that even the usually sparky Marc by Marc Jacobs diffusion line looked eerily similar to the previous season, rather defeating the point of biannual catwalk shows. To make up for a lack of wit or daring, New York turns either to a trite sexiness (\u00e0 la Betsey Johnson) or to a tired and tiresome snobbishness. Bryan Bradley's Tuleh label is apparently adored by wealthy young socialites, who find that a dress in pale violet silk faille and matching coat fills a glaring hole in their wardrobes. Well, good for them, but why should the rest of us be remotely interested in what a bunch of inbred twits wear to each other's engagement parties? And then there is what we might call the four-ply-cashmere-taupe-cardigan problem: a tedious obsession with luxury for its own sake. There is a point where \"aspirational\" fashion veers off into the brainless pursuit of outrageous price tags, and that point is somewhere around Michael Kors. The designer himself is a charming, clever and witty man, and he can make wonderful clothes - there was a blue crystal evening dress in his latest collection that shimmered like a swimming pool, a summer show-stealer if ever I saw one. But too many of his clothes - a mink vest in cobalt, a doubleface \"cashgora\" blazer in tangerine - read like an Ab Fab fashion parody. I feel like a traitor. As a fashion journalist, it is part of my job to persuade those of you who think fashion is simply a waste of space that it's not. And believe me, there are good things about fashion: they just weren't much in evidence this week. Thank heavens London Fashion Week starts tomorrow. Roll on the one-legged trousers, I say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
