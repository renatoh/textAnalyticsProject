Picador \u00a37.99 A man and his young son crawl across a scorched and blasted landscape, heading for the sea. As nuclear winter closes in, they confront both starvation and violent death. Horribly, the slow end and the sudden one constitute a dual threat: the risk is not just that they will be killed, but killed and eaten. Set in a post-apocalyptic America, The Road paints a picture of a world sickened to the very core. It is a millennarian vision, yet McCarthy is never less than utterly convincing. He captures the chilling physicality of sudden terror and seeping dread with prose that feels like it has been carved rather than written. From this bleak carapace, a human story of epic proportions emerges, beautiful yet terrible. With this exquisite nightmare, McCarthy has written his masterpiece. A Spot of Bother, by Mark Haddon. Vintage \u00a37.99 When you write a book as bold and original as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, your subsequent output will be measured against it. Comparisons become inevitable. Again, Haddon's subject is a psychiatric condition, middle-class Britain his milieu. This time, the person caught at right angles to life is George Hall, 57, a married man of previously wearisome stability. Cast adrift by retirement and assailed by his family's bickering, George begins to lose his mind. Haddon's rendering of the Halls's reactions is painfully funny, tender yet unsentimental. Surprisingly, however, he deals poorly with George's illness: focusing on the mundanity of madness, he fails to capture its utterly alien aspect. This is a well-written, warm novel, but it cannot compare to what came before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
