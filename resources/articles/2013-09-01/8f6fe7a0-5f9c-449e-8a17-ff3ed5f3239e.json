You can choreograph the most flawless political narrative, do everything right \u2013 and still have your whole week hijacked by something not even the cleverest media strategist could have seen coming. On Monday night Rachel Reeves appeared as a guest on Newsnight. The young MP for Leeds West had only returned from maternity leave a week earlier, and had planned out a thoughtful re-entry into the public's consciousness. There had been a Today programme interview, a speech about low pay, and all had been going to plan. Then late on Monday night Ian Katz, Newsnight's new editor, accidentally sent a private tweet intended for a friend to his 26,000 followers. The show had gone well, he wrote \u2013 \"apart from boring snoring Rachel Reeves\". Even by the febrile standards of contemporary political coverage, the uproar was extreme. The Labour party threatened to boycott Newsnight and demanded a full public apology, claiming the tweet had called into question the \"impartiality and fairness\" of the programme. Columnists and pundits pitched in to debate whether boring MPs are good or bad for democracy, whether Reeves is or is not a bore, and whether the editor of Newsnight should or should not be allowed to hold a private opinion. Almost the only calm voice in the cacophony belonged to Reeves herself, who confined her response to an ironic, one-word tweet on Monday night: \"Thanks \u2026\" She'd been in the car on the way back from the Newsnight studio when she saw Katz's tweet. \"And I thought, Ian? That can't be the editor. I thought I must have made a mistake. So then I did a search for Rachel Reeves on Twitter, and it came up again. And I looked and thought, it is him. Oh my God. I just thought \u2026 \" and she stutters a bit, \"I thought, I've just been on your programme at 11 o'clock at night, I've got a tiny baby at home, I could have been at home. I just felt humiliated when I saw what he'd said.\" She had only, she points out, been back to work for eight days. The shadow chief secretary to the treasury had attended a round table for women in small business that morning in Reading, taken a train straight to the TUC conference, arrived back in Waterloo at 9.30pm and gone straight to the Newsnight studios. \"And you agree to do this because that is our job. But then you sort of think, God, do you know what? I've got better things to do with my time.\" When she got home and told her husband, a civil servant in the cabinet office, what had happened, he was furious. \"But then I also think, do you know what, who cares? I got home and thought, there's more important things. It has been preoccupying me all week, but I think if the biggest thing I've got to worry about is whether Ian Katz thinks I'm boring then I haven't got many problems, have I? People on this road,\" and she points out of the cafe window to a street peppered with pound shops and charity stores, \"have had a lot of harder things happen to them this week. They've had to put something back in the supermarket or worry about whether they can afford for their kids to go on a school trip this week.\" She cannot believe the commotion the tweet has generated. \"Is this what politics is about? That is apparently more newsworthy than a speech about what Labour would do on the living wage?\" Evidently, however, the answer is yes \u2013 and some commentators have suggested she should accept that if she wants to see Labour elected she should learn to lighten up, because these days it's winning personalities that win elections. Are they wrong? \"But people also say they want ordinary people, and ordinary people aren't flamboyantly extravagant. They also say they want politicians who understand the issues they're facing. Well, that's what I was trying to do \u2013 to talk about those issues. And no, it's not particularly exciting \u2013 the relentless grind of poverty is not that exciting. But I think it's important.\" Monday's episode of Newsnight featured the Arctic Monkeys, and Chris Huhne on his experience of prison. \"Maybe in between such fun and excitement I was a bit boring. But it's Newsnight. It's supposed to cover news.\" Before we met I had wondered whether she would have some jokes or surprises prepared, to rebut Katz's comment. But she says: \"I'm not going to think, next time I'm on television or radio, how can I say something really exciting? That's not what I went into politics to do. I went into politics to try to make things better for people, and that means tackling low pay and insecurity, and that's what I'm going to carry on talking about.\" But she allows a glimpse of her hurt when she says: \"I just want to forget about it really. I haven't watched it [the Newsnight interview] back, so I don't know whether it was,\" and she falters for a moment before the word, \"boring\". She spent all week wondering how to respond. \"But I didn't ask for this to happen, I didn't ask for the rest of my week to be taken up by all this stuff, so I just decided I wasn't going to do anything about it.\" She did speak to Katz, following his written apology. \"I just said obviously I accept your apology, but I told him how I felt. That I felt slightly humiliated, and frustrated that this is now going to define my return to politics.\" She doesn't think the editor should talk about his guests in that way, even in private. \"Of course! It's no way to talk about your guests. If he wants to make a decision that he doesn't want to discuss issues [like low pay on Newsnight] then that's fine, but he should just have some common decency.\" I've met Reeves enough times in the past to be able to tell as soon as we met yesterday that she'd been thoroughly rattled by the Newsnight ding-dong, and I feel desperately sorry for her. Our interview had been set up long in advance, and she'd arranged to show me some of the work she's been doing locally. Reeves takes me to a 17-storey tower block to meet some tenants and hear about the problems they've had with faulty lifts, filthy lobbies and unruly teenagers \u2013 and I can see why she'd been so concerned back in August to make sure that this interview would focus on her work as a constituency MP. Earlier in the summer she was tipped to replace Tom Watson as Labour's general election strategist, Tessa Jowell speculated last year that she could be the party's first female leader, and if Alistair Darling doesn't return to the shadow cabinet after next year's Scottish independence referendum, that will leave Reeves looking like the only plausible alternative to Ed Balls as shadow chancellor. So she had a lot of reasons for wanting to come across as an unassuming and conscientious local MP. Unfortunately, however, faulty lifts and the like also run the risk of looking a little bit boring. But as she points out: \"If you talked to people on the street and asked what they think people should talk about on a flagship news programme, people would talk about the cost of living. I don't think that is boring. \"But also, what do you want from the shadow chief secretary to the treasury? I really prepare for every interview I do. I make sure I know all of my facts. I guess what I don't do is think: 'How can I make this sound really glamorous or exciting?' Because I don't think that's what people want. Glamorous and exciting are probably not two things you'd want from someone in charge of public finances. You want someone who's steady, who's serious, who's responsible \u2013 and I hope that I tick those boxes. I'm not a pop star or a movie star or a comedian, so I'm going to continue to be serious about the issues, and take them seriously. You know, at the community meeting I went to yesterday there weren't many opportunities to display a fantastic sense of humour or great wit. It was about the nitty-gritty. And I think people would prefer a chief secretary to the treasury who can add up the numbers.\" I'm certain the tenants she introduces to me couldn't care less about whether or not she makes an entertaining TV guest. Before Reeves had got involved with their problems, the lifts in the tower block routinely broke down, and so pensioners with shopping and parents with pushchairs would have to climb dozens of flights of stairs, past teenagers drinking and taking drugs, even couples copulating. Their problems probably wouldn't set the Newsnight studio alight, but form the fabric of their daily lives, and inform, Reeves points out, all her work on economic policy. She insists that Labour's economic message on low pay, job insecurity, the living wage and zero-hours contracts will be the one voters want in 2015, because the recovery currently being reported with such excitement by the media does not resonate with their actual lived experiences. She cites a couple she knows, of whom the wife works part-time, and the husband has just landed a full-time job earning \u00a37 an hour. \"According to the statistics, they're an economic success story, right? They're both in work.\" But he still has to deliver pizzas in the evenings, because they have two children and a third on the way. They have just been given a new council house, but it's only one of just two newly built in Reeves' constituency, and the family cannot afford to carpet the unfinished floors, or even buy curtains. \"That's not an economic success story.\" Reeves' local church is using the vaults to store food in food banks, and a large part of her vicar's job is now to deliver it to people who cannot afford to feed their families. \"And Michael Gove says it's people's own fault if they need to use a food bank?\" She breaks off in a shudder of despairing disgust. The daughter of two teachers, she went to a south London comprehensive before studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford and spending the next 10 years working as an economist with the Bank of England, the British embassy in Washington and HBOS bank. We first met shortly before the 2010 election, when I interviewed a group of female Labour parliamentary candidates for a women's magazine. I remember how she sat very still, surrounded by the froth and frills of a glossy magazine photo shoot, and how her gravitas made her seem a lot older than her 31 years. Gravitas is not a euphemism for boring; she wasn't humourless or dour, just deeply serious \u2013 a quality, without wishing to be unkind, not evident in some of the other candidates that day. So I wasn't remotely surprised to see her sail up the ranks so quickly once elected. She does have a tendencey to go a bit wooden in front of the camera, and her normally deep and modulated voice can get a bit strangulated once a microphone appears. But Alistair Darling was a very successful treasury secretary without ever performing the cancan on Newsnight. She rules herself out for the job of general election strategist categorically. \"No one has talked to me about it, and it's not going to happen,\" but she will go on Newsnight again. \"Because that's my job.\" But she won't look back on this week with any affection. \"No, not really,\" she offers drily. She must just want it over and done with, I say \u2013 and for a fleeting moment, she seems to sag. \"Yeah, but it won't be. If you Google Rachel Reeves, I expect you'll find lots of references to whether I'm boring or not.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
