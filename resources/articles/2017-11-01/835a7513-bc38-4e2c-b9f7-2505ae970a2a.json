The Swede made his comeback in the 4-1 win against Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Saturday, entering proceedings on 77 minutes as a replacement for Anthony Martial. It was the 36\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s first action since sustaining the injury on 20 April playing against Anderlecht in the Europa League. While the problem was considered grave enough to question whether Ibrahimovic would play again, he stated it was actually more dire than previously known. \u201cIf people knew the real injury, they would be in shock that I was even playing. It was more than the knee but I will keep it personal \u2013 that\u2019s why I choose not to talk of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my recovery I have not rushed anything; I have been out for six and half months. I have been following protocol and my schedule day by day. The only secret has been working hard. Those close to me know what I have been doing. I was working five, six hours a day. \u201cWhen it happened I said giving up was not an option. My only focus was on coming back and coming back better. I know it\u2019s my head playing, not my knee; my knee has to follow. With my experience and career I know what I have to do but I feel good. I am very proud of the moment to play again and for everyone around me because I wouldn\u2019t have done it alone. Thanks to the supporters for keeping me motivated, the coach who\u2019s trusted me, the club that believes in me and my family obviously.\u201d Ibrahimovic received a rousing reception. \u201cIt was an amazing reaction from fans but I felt it from day one,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the first step in the warm-up, with people singing and cheering for you, it\u2019s what keeps you going. This was not a one-man work, it was everyone\u2019s and thanks to them that I am back on field and can play.\u201d Paul Pogba also made his comeback from a hamstring injury and was instrumental in United\u2019s victory. Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side took the led through a 14th-minute Dwight Gayle goal before Pogba took over. First he created Antony Martial\u2019s 37th-minute equaliser by driving down the right and crossing for the Frenchman to head home. Then, after Chris Smalling put United ahead just before half-time, Pogba scored United\u2019s third on 54 minutes following a smart Marcus Rashford header. Romelu Lukaku broke a personal seven-game drought on 70 minutes for his 17th of the season as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team kept the gap to the leaders, Manchester City, to eight points. Of being able to overhaul Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, Ibrahimovic said: \u201cWe can chase City. Why is it not a possibility? We are all here because we want to win and we need to because they are first.\u201d On Pogba he said: \u201cI can talk of what Paul brings \u2013 big quality. It was like he hasn\u2019t been injured for a month. He brings such big quality, a different quality, and I bring experience and mine. I try to help the guys as much as possible and do what I can.\u201d Marcos Rojo, who sustained a serious knee injury in the same game as Ibrahimovic, also returned to the match-day squad. \u201cThis week the manager\u2019s been very happy because he has a full team for the first time this season and as a coach you want those opportunities and alternatives to make changes,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cWe just need to pick and choose. He knows what he is doing even when the number of players are limited because he\u2019s a winner and has been winning every season.\u201d Ibrahimovic believes United can win the title and the Champions League. \u201cI think there is a possibility for everything. We were early into it [side\u2019s development] last year and won two trophies and we are stronger this season. We believe we can do it. To win and get the trophies.\u201d Regarding whether he will extend his one-year contract the forward said: \u201cAt the moment I am just thankful I can play football again. I don\u2019t know what the future brings but what happens happens. I am at the age where I can choose what I want to do. I don\u2019t sign five- or 10-year deals. I am just happy to be back playing and doing what I am good at. \u201cJos\u00e9 said: \u2018Do whatever you want. I trust in you and you know what you have to do.\u2019 So I was not worried. The contract is all paperwork and I do the physical work.\u201d Ibrahimovic did not sign on for United again until August. \u201cEven if I had a contract or not, I needed to train. The other\u2019s up to the other people,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I would stay because I wanted to stay. The numbers have never been an issue. I could\u2019ve signed a deal after two months but didn\u2019t because I am honest with myself. I want to stay because I can perform.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
