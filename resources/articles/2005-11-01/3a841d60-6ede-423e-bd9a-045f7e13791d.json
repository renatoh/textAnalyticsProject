Downing Street's efficiency adviser, Sir Peter Gershon, is reported to be ready to recommend the purchase of three aircraft to carry ministers and senior members of the royal family. Officials at Number 10 have long felt it was impractical to go on chartering planes or using those in the Queen's Flight. They covet a custom-built plane like those used by successions of US presidents. However the Chancellor has made it clear there will be no new money for such aircraft, and any new fleet will have to be paid for from existing budgets. With belts tightening in Whitehall, it is unlikely the project would be seen as high priority. Downing Street said Gershon's report had not yet been completed, let alone presented to the cabinet. However the Cabinet Office confirmed that Gershon had run his recommendations past Brown. 'Sir Peter is sensibly consulting before presenting his report to Number 10 and ministers,' a spokesman said. Ironically, thanks to Tony Blair's decision to resign before the next election, the prime minister most likely to use a new plane would be not him but - if he succeeds to the premiership - Brown. However, the Chancellor has made clear in the past when ministerial travel has been reviewed that he does not regard such prestige projects as a priority. Last week it emerged that he bought economy class tickets for his wife, Sarah, and their son, John, when they accompanied him on an official trip to Washington. The airline then upgraded them to join him in business class. In studying the pros and cons of buying a fleet of ministerial aircraft, the Chancellor will have to weigh up the fact that charters or commercial flights cost serious money. The most recent government figures reveal that Blair's 21 foreign trips in the past financial year have cost more than \u00a3800,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
