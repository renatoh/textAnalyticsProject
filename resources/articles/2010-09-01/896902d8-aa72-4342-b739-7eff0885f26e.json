There are various ploys. Last year it was chocolate; this year one church has produced a stick of rock that says \"Come back to church\" right through it, since, after all, who needs teeth in heaven? People stop going to church for all sorts of reasons. Dudgeon is a good one, or there's boredom, taking the boys to rugby training, not ever being asked to do something (amazing, but true), or, quite frequently, plain forgetfulness: \"Darling, have you seen that church recently? I must have put it down somewhere.\" Just inviting people back isn't much good, of course, unless things are better than they remember them. There are lots of factors that help: a beautifully appointed church, a decent-sized congregation with people who look roughly like them, good music, somebody who actually talks to them (though preferably not during the sermon) \u2013 these all help. But there's one make-or-break element that seldom gets mentioned: the quality of the priest. Congregations don't like to admit a priest makes such a difference, but show me a growing church and I can be pretty confident I will open the vestry door and show you a decent cleric. The size of the congregation is not the deciding factor, of course, but a good priest can fill a church, and a bad one can empty it. What makes a good priest is open to interpretation, but we are helped here by Sir Andrew Motion, who articulated some of the desirable qualities in a poem presented a fortnight ago to Mark Oakley on the priest's departure from Grosvenor Chapel to St Paul's Cathedral. The poem is relatively sober: \"You sat me down and let the silence close to set me on the straight road home.\" The speech with which Motion introduced it was more effusive. Praising the way in which Oakley had conducted Motion's wedding last summer, he finished: \"In the best possible way, there will always be a third person in our marriage. Yes, Mark, it's you.\" This is possibly not what everybody wants from their priest, but there were more universal values that Motion picked out: \"Wisdom and wit, principle and tolerance, gravitas and amusement.\" I say \"universal\"; would that they were. From this list, each attribute is desirable, but if you can't have them all, go for principle. I have known priests who can't preach to save a life, tone-deaf priests, priests with funny handshakes, priests who used to teeter publicly on the cliff-edge of faith, priests who were useless with money, priests in awe of the churchwarden/organist/flower arranger (quite a few of those), and so on. But if they had integrity, none of that mattered. The best priests are knowledgable, compassionate and utterly trustworthy. And the very best have no inkling of their worth, convinced they are mediocre or worse. In this respect, Motion's remark about the marriage was on the money. It's embarrassing but true: Jesus doesn't want his followers to believe in him, he wants them to marry him. And in a marriage, trust is all important. When thinking about Christ's priestly representatives, it doesn't do to take the marriage analogy too far (though a few of us have). Still, perhaps the clearest sign of a good priest is if you can contemplate meeting him or her over the breakfast table. Next year's Back to Church Sunday gimmick could be a bowl of cereal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
