This dramatic result will stand out as one of his finest moments. Selecting Craig Gardner and Jack Colback as his emergency full-backs proved a masterstroke. Deprived of resources through injury and illness he arranged his men into unlikely areas and, with big hearts and fantastic covering, they denied their technically superior opponents. Most importantly, however, O'Neill balanced his team. He began with three left-footed players on his left side, and a fourth left-sider, Matthew Kilgallon, joined the game when Wes Brown fell victim to a groin strain in the first half. Early on, the talented Adam Johnson on Manchester City's right suggested he might seriously trouble Colback in the left-back position \u2013 he took the ball round him and cut inside far too comfortably. But James McClean, Sunderland's left-sided midfielder, who showed early control and penetration, curbed his attacking instincts and dropped a shade narrower and deeper to cut off the passing angle to Johnson's feet. David Vaughan looked to nick balls on the inside as City monopolised the play. Vital interceptions were won. And when Johnson did take the ball past his marker, Kilgallon battled Edin Dzeko and covered the space behind Colback. O'Neill's deployment of makeshift full-backs had a further upside. Both Colback and Gardner were able, when the opportunity presented itself, to move forward comfortably and pass the ball as midfielders would, rather than launch it long. When Sergio Ag\u00fcero was introduced, then David Silva, Sunderland somehow upped their defensive resolution. City may consider that 19 goal attempts and 10 forced corners are statistics that are deserving of a goal or two. But for all the visitors' intricate football, the home team stood firm. Colback was able to get extra close when Johnson did receive and control cleanly and the City player was disturbed by touch-tight marking and fierce tackling. When Vaughan covered Colback on the inside, Lee Cattermole, a strong tackler, and Sebastian Larsson shifted their positioning to cover and gave no ground. And though Sunderland were forced deeper and deeper, there was no space for City behind the rejigged home backline. Sunderland's self-belief will grow massively as a consequence of Ji Dong-won's unlikely winner. O'Neill will continue to graft and remind his players that they can move mountains. Roberto Mancini should not worry too much. On another day they might have been comfortable two-goal winners but it was another triumph for the mercurial Northern Irishman and a happy new year for the bookmakers who are enjoying these shock results."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
