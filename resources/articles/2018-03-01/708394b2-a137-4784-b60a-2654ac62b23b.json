Her extraordinary production redeems a seldom-seen play by Tennessee Williams. It also irradiates Williams\u2019s gifts: his lyricism and wildness \u2013 and his strangeness. It is from the beginning a revelation. No sultriness and sashaying, but intensity, isolation, peculiarity. Patsy Ferran, enclosed in a bubble of golden light, stands at the front of the bare stage with a mic. She is having a panic attack, gulping for air and syllables. Behind her the rest of the cast sit at upright pianos, their backs to her as they play. Angus MacRae\u2019s music rolls through the action, as individual notes and occasional melodies. Tom Scutt\u2019s set and Lee Curran\u2019s lighting design create a surreal landscape. Even the keyboards have an eerie vitality, flashing white to produce the effect of fireworks. Originally called \u201cChart of Anatomy\u201d, Summer and Smoke features the almost love affair between Alma \u2013 neurasthenic singing teacher, prim daughter of a minister \u2013 and the lusty son of a local doctor. First staged just after A Streetcar Named Desire, in 1948, it is a source book for Williams\u2019s themes: mental fragility, insistent muscularity, sexual suppression. Williams claimed that Alma \u2013 he over-insistently points out this means \u201csoul\u201d in Spanish \u2013 was his favourite heroine: like him, a late developer. Not everyone has shared his enthusiasm. The first Broadway production was a failure. Twelve years ago a West End revival closed early. But Frecknall, focusing everything through Alma\u2019s fractured sensibility, makes the play into an intimate triumph. There is more than one marvel. A neat vignette from Nancy Crane as a dippy mother with a passion for jigsaws and ice cream. A beautiful blues number languorously delivered by Anjana Vasan. And a first-rate performance by Matthew Needham as the hot doc: twisting between rawness and confidence, hesitancy and coercion. Still, the evening depends on Ferran. There has been plenty of reason to praise her since her debut only four years ago. Now she moves to a different level. She brings her distinctive restlessness to the part: swivelling features, limbs threatening to shift out of their sockets. That has looked like a comic talent, but here febrility becomes tragic. Her face is constantly tweaked by fear; anxious to impress, she pushes her mouth into a smile with her fingers. Her speech comes in compulsive gushes and staccato phrases, as if every word were weighted with possibilities. As it sometimes seems. Alma deals in fancy locutions \u2013 she calls a car \u201ca four-wheel phenomenon\u201d \u2013 and woozy inwardness. Brilliantly, Williams shows that sensuality has always been welling up in her, evident in her speech. When drowsy, she feels \u201clike a water-lily on a Chinese lagoon\u201d. And who could resist a play in which the heroine supplies a tranquilliser, explaining: \u201cThe prescription number is 96814. I think of it as the telephone number of God!\u201d If only Rufus Norris had savoured his script\u2019s most pungent moments with equal gusto. Instead, he has matched his slasher production of Macbeth with a slashed text that eviscerates the witches\u2019 speeches \u2013 no hubble-bubble or eye of newt \u2013 and makes the drama blunter, more one-dimensional. The dominant note is anger, barely inflected by fear or despair. At times everyone seems to be head-butting both stage and verse. Soldiers whoop and holler and grunt in unison; the king leads them in a dance like the lord of misrule. Severed heads are dropped so often into plastic bags that you expect a Tesco van to home-deliver them. The pairing of Rory Kinnear and Anne-Marie Duff as the Macbeths looked inspired. But though they hinge together well, neatly showing the point at which strength ebbs from her to him, their performances are flattened by the prevailing wrath. They are an impoverished couple on the make. Kinnear is a martial not a meditative presence, too robust to seem deeply disturbed, though he does something remarkable with this interpretation in the \u201ctomorrow and tomorrow\u201d speech, making it less of a philosophical lament than a practical complaint. Kinnear is not so much mournful as disgusted, a sulky teenager kicking against constraints, addressing himself not to fate but to the dead wife he holds in his arms. Duff is precise, guarding against her own fragility \u2013 she delivers her smashing-the-baby speech tearfully \u2013 but lacks the fire that usually makes her so memorable. The most blazing performance comes from Patrick O\u2019Kane as Macduff, glowering with tamped-down energy at the start, and under the cosh of tragedy turning into the hell-hound he accuses Macbeth of being. Poverty hovers as an explanation for the couple\u2019s cruelty \u2013 Duff\u2019s jeans are very scruffy; their feast is held in a cramped murky space like a disused railway carriage. This brings its own absurdities. Would the king really have put up here? Then the discovery of his death has to take a little time. While Macduff is offstage hoping to wake him up, the audience needs to be given news of dire combustions and bad omens. But Macduff only has to nip around the corner. What can he be doing to take so long? Stuffing the corpse? Rae Smith\u2019s black pleated walls \u2013 bin-bag cliffs \u2013 engulf the action on the huge Olivier stage. They are dark all right, and of a piece with the large amounts of 21st-century waste sloshing around: Macbeth\u2019s battle tunic is secured with brown sticky tape. Still there is little here to suggest a struggle with doom, though Paul Arditti\u2019s soundscape of foghorn moans suggests a wounded creature trapped in the wings. The witches are decorative and only mildly disconcerting. One does a bit of scuttling; the others are statuesque. At the end they perch on high poles as if they were the sourest fruits of the forest. Or lollipops. Not a weird look.
