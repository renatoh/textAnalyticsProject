The 12 recommendations in the report included a new \"five day start - five-week finish\" for customers switching their current account provider. This is less than half the present time frame of 12 weeks. The proposals, which are in tended to inject more competition into financial services, are from the Banking Services Consumer Codes Review Group, chaired by the Bank of England economist DeAnne Julius. Banks and building societies which fail to exchange information about customers' direct debits within the five-day period should pay compensation of \u00a350 to the customer, Ms Julius, a former member of the monetary policy committee, said yesterday. Her recommendations were published amid mounting speculation that Lloyds TSB would learn today that its \u00a319bn bid for Abbey National had been blocked by the competition commission. The dominance of the big four - Lloyds TSB, NatWest, Barclays and HSBC - in the provision of current accounts has been highlighted as one of the main elements in the competition commission's investigation into the bid. Ms Julius believes the industry's voluntary code should be sufficient to implement the new current account switching timetable. However, Halifax, one bank which has made a push to attract new current accounts, called for the five-week target to be \"enshrined in legislation\". Halifax also cast doubt on the ability for banks to meet the deadline unless companies from which direct debits needed to be changed - such as utilities - respond to the banks within three days. Abbey National, though, said it could be possible to switch accounts within 13 days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
