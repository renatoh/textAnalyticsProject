Mr Brown was at his wife's bedside for the birth of their first child. Their daughter was born just after midday at Forth Park Hospital, in Kirkcaldy, Fife, which is near his constituency home. The girl, who has not yet been named, was born by caesarean section seven weeks early, following medical advice after a routine scan yesterday. She weighed just 2lb 4oz, but was said by a spokesman for Mr Brown to be \"doing fine\" and breathing independently. The exact nature of the problem which required such an early birth was not being disclosed. The spokesman said: \"They are both delighted with their beautiful baby girl. Sarah is recovering well and will go home after the weekend, but, as normal, the baby will remain in hospital to make sure everything remains fine.\" Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: \"I'm delighted for Sarah and Gordon and send them my warmest congratulations.\" Mr Wallace, who is also Scotland's deputy first minister, added: \"It gives them and their families all the more to celebrate in the festive season.\" Earlier this year, Mrs Brown resigned from her job as a director of PR firm Hobsbawm Macauley Communications and plans to take several months off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
