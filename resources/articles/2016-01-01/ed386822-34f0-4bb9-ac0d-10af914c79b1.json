Tottenham are four points off first place after their late win at Watford on Monday and they visit Everton on Sunday seeking their fourth consecutive victory but Pochettino is not getting carried away. \u201cWe need to arrive in the last 10 games with the possibility to fight for the objectives,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe next nine, 10 games will maybe make the mark on how we finish in the table.\u201d Pochettino, who has indicated he will make signings this month only if they do not disrupt the balance of his squad, believes the maturity of his young side\u2019s behaviour is a sign they will be able to handle the pressure of challenging for the title. Spurs are fourth and have lost only twice. \u201cI think we are very quiet,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe good thing is we don\u2019t speak too much but we work very hard and I think it is most important how we behave inside, so that we can speak outside. Because football is about winning games, and to win games and to be close to winning games, you need to work hard and to show better quality than the opponent. \u201cWe are very quiet. We believe in ourselves. We are very confident and in football a lot can happen. We believe. The only way we cannot achieve all that we can in football is if we stop working hard.\u201d Pochettino admitted the challenge for him and his coaching staff is to ensure they do not stand still. \u201cI think this always is our challenge, to try to improve every day because if you stop improving you start to go backwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that we always, in our minds, try to improve every day. \u201cHow? This is a good question, it\u2019s our quality and our creativity, and this is because we work every day. It\u2019s our motivation every day to try to improve and develop new ideas. We need to create every day and try to improve ourselves to teach the players.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s hopes of beating Everton will largely depend on how they cope with Romelu Lukaku, who has scored 11 goals in his past 10 matches. However the Belgian striker will not find it easy against two of his international team-mates. Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have formed an outstanding partnership in central defence since the latter\u2019s arrival from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last summer and Tottenham have the best defensive record in the Premier League, with 15 goals conceded from 19 matches. \u201cIt is obvious after 19 games that Alderweireld is one of the best defenders in the Premier League,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think it is easy to analyse him now. He has given us very good performance and maturity and experience. He is a great boy, a great man.\u201d Vertonghen\u2019s form has improved alongside his fellow Belgian centre-back. \u201cThey are good partners,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFor me, it is important how we work as a team, to try and defend our goal, and to have a very good balance. But it is true that Toby has made a very good impact in the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
