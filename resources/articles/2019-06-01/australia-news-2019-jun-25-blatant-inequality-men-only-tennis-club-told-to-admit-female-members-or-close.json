The constitution of the Adamstown Rosebud tennis club in Newcastle, New South Wales, only allows men to become members, which, until recently, meant women could not access a \u201cheavily discounted\u201d member rate when booking courts. Local tennis player and coach Emma Pollock raised the issue with the council late last year, after she discovered male players had access to discounts and other membership rights not extended to women. Pollock said she \u201cwas extremely disappointed that this blatant gender inequality still exists in this day and age\u201d. The City of Newcastle, which owns the courts the club uses, has written to the club and said it must amend its constitution to give women \u201cthe same status, rights and obligations as male members\u201d. It said the club\u2019s discriminatory policies were a breach of its own licence agreement with the council, and if unchanged, it would not renew the club\u2019s licence. Since the initial complaint, the club has offered its discount rate to everyone \u2013 but has still not allowed women to become members. Tennis Australia said the Adamstown Rosebud club\u2019s rules \u201cclearly breaches\u201d national policies and it was an \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d. \u201cAffiliated organisations must not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, religion or any other protected characteristic,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cTennis has a long history as one of the most inclusive and welcoming sports.\u201d A representative of the Adamstown Rosebud tennis club said: \u201cWe are working with council to resolve the issue, and that will happen in due course.\u201d Newcastle council also sent a letter to the club on Friday, saying its policy was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, breached the council\u2019s own rules and potentially the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977. \u201cIt has been brought to the attention of CN [City of Newcastle] that the tennis club\u2019s constitution only allows for male members and precludes female members,\u201d the council wrote. \u201cThis is not acceptable to CN as it does not accord with the values of equity and non-discrimination which CN promotes internally and in the community.\u201d On Tuesday, a council spokesman said the club had until 5 July to present a proposed amendment to an extraordinary general meeting, or its lease would not be renewed. \u201cEarlier this year the club changed its pricing structure, in response to subsequent approaches by the city, to extend the discount to casual users of the courts,\u201d the council said. \u201cBut its refusal to date to amend its constitution to allow women to become members is considered unacceptable by the City of Newcastle on the basis that its facilities are public assets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
