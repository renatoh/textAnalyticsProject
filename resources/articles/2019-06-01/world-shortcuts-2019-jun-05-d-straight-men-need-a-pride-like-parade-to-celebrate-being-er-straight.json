Age: At present, still slouching toward Bethlehem to be born. Appearance: Embarrassing. Isn\u2019t it OK to be both straight and proud? You might feel differently about that after reading this. What\u2019s happening? A group of straight men, who call themselves Super Happy Fun America, have applied for a permit to hold a \u201cStraight Pride parade\u201d in Boston this summer. Oh dear, I see what you mean. The group claims it exists to \u201ccelebrate the diverse history, culture and contributions of the straight community\u201d. What contributions are they talking about, frisbee golf? They also have a flag, and even their own mascot: Brad Pitt. Does Brad Pitt know about this? You tell him. Are straight women part of Straight Pride? If they\u2019ve been invited, they do not appear to have accepted. What would a Straight Pride parade even look like? A queue outside an Apple store? Careful \u2013 you\u2019re in danger of stereotyping straight men. To be fair, they\u2019ve done most of the heavy lifting on that score. And you\u2019re also being quite intolerant of straights. Not all straights. Just the ones who want to have a parade about it. Why? They\u2019re only fighting for straight inclusivity. What\u2019s their slogan going to be? \u201cCome to our parade! Forget about getting laid \u2013 ever!\u201d You\u2019re enjoying this, I can see. I\u2019ve got a lot more, if need be. Is this parade really happening? It depends on who you ask. Super Happy Fun America\u2019s vice-president Mark Sahady said the city of Boston would be \u201cworking with us on the parade\u201d after the group filed a discrimination suit. And Boston? The city says the group\u2019s permit to hold the event has not been approved. What has the reaction to this news been? Ridicule, largely. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a Straight Pride Parade,\u201d said comedian Ron Funches on Twitter. \u201cParades are inherently gay. Embrace it.\u201d Maybe there should be some kind of Gay Pride parade, then. Well, in a statement to BuzzFeed, Boston mayor Marty Walsh directed people to the city\u2019s upcoming Pride week, \u201cto celebrate the diversity, strength and acceptance of our LGBTQ community. This is a special week that represents Boston\u2019s values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering.\u201d That sounds nice. Perhaps the straights could enter their own float in that. We\u2019ll see. Do say: \u201cIf Straight Pride had been invented sooner, they might not have had to close all those branches of Burton.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWhere are all you guys going? The Boat Show\u2019s that way!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
