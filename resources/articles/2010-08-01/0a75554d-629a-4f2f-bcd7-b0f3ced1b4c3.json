Here was the deputy prime minister's answer: his party would ensure austerity was fair, with the tax rises and spending cuts falling mostly on the richest. The Conservatives took up this theme, with the chancellor describing his measures as \"progressive\". Both parties are going to have to take back their words after today's report from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies. The most comprehensive analysis of the social impact of the budget \u2013 which takes into account tax rises and, for the first time, changes to benefits \u2013 flatly contradicts Mr Clegg and George Osborne. Most of the progressive tax rises to come in over the next couple years, says the IFS, are Labour's handiwork. As for the new measures brought in by the new coalition, they are \"generally regressive\" \u2013 that is, hitting the poor harder than the rich. If you are in a family with children at the bottom of the pile then you are among the biggest losers of this government's reforms, with your net income cut by more than 5%. This was a group, remember, that Mr Clegg swore he had protected; so much for that boast. If on the other hand you are a childless family right at the top of tree, then Mr Osborne has fixed it for you to do best of all. There are two striking pictures in the IFS report. The first is a bar chart that illustrates the tax and benefit reforms introduced by Labour before May: they hit the better-off harder and harder all the way up to the richest 10%. That is what we typically describe as progressive reforms. The second graph shows the effects of Mr Osborne's inaugural budget \u2013 and it shows that the poorer you are, the poorer you will get under this new government. No minister can read this report and attempt to describe their measures as fair. They are anything but. Nor is it the case that these regressive measures are a one-off. Far from it: the biggest reason the chancellor's emergency budget is so unfair is because he has permanently pegged benefits to the lower consumer price index (CPI) rather than the old retail prices index (RPI). That may sound technical, but consider this: CPI is currently just above 3%, while RPI is nearly 5%. Now imagine your disability benefits inching up by 3% a year every year rather than 5%: within just a few years that leaves you with a big shortfall. This one fact puts in perspective the recent speculation about how Iain Duncan Smith is fighting for more generous welfare provision \u2013 a couple of billion extra does not offset the many billions being taken from society's support for the poorest. With full access to all the Treasury models, Mr Osborne will have known how much poorer he was about to make some of the most vulnerable members of society \u2013 yet he went ahead and did it anyway. The ultimate political fact of this IFS analysis is that it deprives Mr Clegg and the Lib Dems of the fig leaf that they are the good angels in this coalition, guiding it towards progressive economic outcomes. Nor can they claim that this austerity is necessary. Indeed, evidence is mounting that these swingeing cuts leave the UK dangerously exposed to another downturn. Yesterday a Bank of England member cautioned that a double-dip recession was a \"real risk\"; last week the credit rating agency Moody's warned that a downgrading of the UK's AAA status had become more likely \u2013 because of the risks to growth. When in opposition Mr Osborne used to quote Moody's a lot; he seems to have ignored this latest warning. But then, as this IFS report reminds us, the new government is being very selective about which evidence it heeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
