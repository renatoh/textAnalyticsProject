City were fined around \u00a350m by Uefa this year for FFP breaches \u2013 they will have to pay only around \u00a320m if they comply with the break-even rules in future seasons \u2013 and had their Champions League squad capped at 21 players this season. Chelsea, in contrast, have actively sought to operate within the new boundaries, with their chief executive, Ron Gourlay, admitting last week that the club have to \u201cchase the penny and work much harder across the business\u201d rather than merely relying upon Roman Abramovich\u2019s funding. Yet Mourinho has been critical of Uefa\u2019s decision to impose fines on the three offenders, City, Paris Saint-Germain and Zenit St Petersburg, arguing the sanction does not act as a proper deterrent. \u201cEverybody knows there are fines and, if these fines exist, control exists,\u201d said the Chelsea manager in an interview with Maisfutebol. \u201cBut, anyway, are the fines fair? I don\u2019t think so. In my opinion the first thing to do would be to remove points and remove titles. If you have important capital which allows you to overcome financial fair play, if you win titles and then you are fined economically, you keep doing the same thing. \u201cThey will take from you one or two players from the Champions League list [shrugs]. Then, instead of 24, you go with 22. But if you\u2019re stating that you\u2019ll start the next Champions League with six points fewer, or you won\u2019t play in the next edition of the Champions League and will go into the Europa League instead, it is more serious.\u201d Chelsea travel to City on Sunday seeking to extend their lead over the champions to eight points, and with a reunion with their former stalwart Frank Lampard to come. Mourinho has insisted the 36-year-old\u2019s chances of returning to Stamford Bridge in some capacity in the future have not been jeopardised by the midfielder\u2019s decision to play for City before a move to Major League Soccer next year. Lampard had departed over the summer as the London club\u2019s leading scorer, with 211 goals over a 13-year career, to sign for New York City only to opt to spend the next six months at the new American franchise\u2019s parent club. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has [harmed his relationship with Chelsea],\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cHe has not with me, that\u2019s for sure. I still believe that what this club proposed to him, to come back when he wants and to do what he wants \u2013 these were the words from Mr Abramovich \u2013 is not in any danger. \u201cThis is just a period of his career. We thought he was going to play for New York. He decided to play for City. I was not expecting him to play for City but it was just an option and he had that right to do that. His place in Chelsea\u2019s history is untouchable. I think, in the future, nothing has been lost. He will be back one day, I think so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
