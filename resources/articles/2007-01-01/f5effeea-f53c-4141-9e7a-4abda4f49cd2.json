That's probably a good thing, because without the politically convenient fine print, the president's plan would almost certainly send fuel prices shooting through the roof. Cutting oil consumption in any significant manner means increased reliance on ethanol and other biofuels because they are easily the most cost-competitive alternative to gasoline on the market. Accordingly, it's worth noting that the president's own Department of Agriculture reports that ethanol costs about $2.53 per gallon to produce - even with the subsidies. Without them, economist Doug Koplow calculates that production costs would be at least $1 per gallon higher. Accordingly, the president's plan would increase fuel prices because gasoline costs only about half what ethanol costs on a Btu basis in wholesale markets. Government support is unlikely to bring corn ethanol costs down because it is the very definition of a mature technology. Alas, the manufacturing costs associated with producing 200 proof grain alcohol have proven fairly fixed over time. Cellulosic ethanol, however, is an emerging technology, so costs might well come down in the future. But they have a long ways to go. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that the capital costs associated with building cellulosic ethanol processing plants are five times greater than they are for corn ethanol facilities, which have capital costs that average $1.50 per gallon according to the US Department of Agriculture. Accordingly, cellulosic ethanol would cost $7.50 per gallon using state of the art technology - and that's before we even get to the price of the feedstock itself. The above analysis probably explains the fine print. Most notably, the president proposes to give three separate cabinet secretaries the authority to kill the entire plan - in whole or in part - should the costs associated with living under his \"20-by-10\" initiative ever get too politically troublesome. This is like making a New Year resolution to lose weight, but giving yourself an escape clause that explicitly gives you the right to waive the resolution should you ever grow tired of the diet. Even so, shouldn't we be willing to pay more for automotive fuel if it means less greenhouse gas emissions as a consequence? Perhaps, but increasing ethanol production will increase - not decrease - greenhouse gas emissions. That's the conclusion of a new paper (pdf) out of MIT's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment. The study offers a complete examination of the fossil energy associated with producing corn ethanol and finds that ethanol yields about the same amount of total greenhouse gas emissions over its entire life cycle as does conventional gasoline. Expanding ethanol production, however, would on balance increase greenhouse gas emissions vis-\u00e0-vis gasoline because expanding corn production would require greater energy inputs at the margin. That seems obvious once you think about it. The new cropland that would have to be harnessed to produce corn would almost certainly be less productive than the cropland being harnessed at present. Less productive soils necessitate more fertilizers and/or irrigation, thus more energy inputs, thus more greenhouse gas emissions on average. The more we expand ethanol production, the worse it gets. Why do so many politicians, then, embrace ethanol? Because ethanol is closest thing to a state religion we have in this country. The farm lobby and ethanol processors like Archer Daniels Midland have vigorously and relentless sold this economic snake oil for over three decades now as a cost-free solution to just about every economic, environmental, and foreign policy problem on the national horizon. Voters like helping farmers - and they like cost free solutions to things that scare them. Politicians, for their part, like affirming voter sentiment. But if ethanol has economic merit, no amount of subsidy is necessary. Businessmen and venture capitalists will in time deliver it to market, because that's how you make a profit in a free market economy. But if ethanol lacks economic merit, then no amount of government subsidy will magically bestow it. And that's all you need to know to weigh the merits of the president's speech last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
