His enthusiasm is infectious\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve been supporting England since I was 11 and remember cheering the World Cup win in 2003. I\u2019m optimistic it will happen again on Saturday, when I\u2019ll be up at the crack of dawn to drive to Surrey to watch the game with my dad as per our tradition. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone better to watch it with \u2013 he\u2019s so invested in England rugby matches that he\u2019ll yell, curse and roar. His enthusiasm is infectious; sometimes I\u2019m louder than he is! My mum isn\u2019t a rugby fan, but she\u2019s always brilliant \u2013 supplying us with sausage sandwiches and putting up with our swearing. England need to maintain the brilliant form they showed against Australia and New Zealand. Both teams are going to go for broke and we need to be careful not to lapse into some of the sloppiness we\u2019ve been prone to in the past. But Eddie Jones and his team are surely on the case, so I\u2019m not too worried. Lucy Eldridge, 27, Oxford \u2018Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are due a stormer\u2019 \u201cI went to Japan for one of the England games and was blown away by the hospitality of the people. The Japanese were hi-fiving me in the streets because I was wearing an England jersey. The only low was the typhoon. I was in Tokyo as it approached and could feel the dread in the air. On Saturday, I\u2019ll be watching at home with my rugby teammates and some close friends, wearing an England jersey with a Japanese beer in hand. Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are due a stormer. I hope this is the game in which they cement their names in English rugby history. Aravin Kumar, 26, Singapore \u2018I\u2019ll watch with my teammates, bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve been getting up early on Saturdays to watch the rugby with my dad at our rugby club with bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate. Last Saturday we had a whole day of rugby. We watched the finals then went to Harlequins because my team Haywards Heath Under 10s were doing a guard of honour thing at the Stoop. I\u2019ve enjoyed watching all of it and on Saturday, my teammates and I will be watching the game at our club on the big screen. My advice to the England team is to tackle hard, run fast and score lots of tries. Rosa McDonald, nine, Haywards Heath \u2018I love how rugby elicits such strong emotions\u2019 It was been a thrilling experience. My family and I found a South African-run pub, the Percy Arms in Chilworth, which draws a large crowd of South Africans. I find watching the game at a pub with lots of fans makes it all the more enjoyable and exciting. You feed off the energy of other supporters. South Africa\u2019s first game was a disappointing loss and left me feeling surprisingly low (still hopeful, however) but I love how rugby elicits such strong emotions. No matter what the score, it brings everyone together \u2013 even opposing sides! We\u2019ll be watching the final with a number of fellow South Africans at the pub, bacon butty and beer in hand. South Africa really needs this win. With our first black captain and the most culturally diverse team we\u2019ve ever had, South Africans everywhere could use this to unite as a nation. This would go far in blurring racial lines that still form a divide in our country. England have done so well this World Cup. If they win, they will truly deserve it, but we won\u2019t go down without a serious fight. If South Africa are to win, we need to focus on keeping our strong defence lines intact. England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don\u2019t drop the ball \u2013 in all senses of the word. Shannon O\u2019Farrell, a South Africa fan in Guildford \u2018We will all be going big with outfits and flags\u2019 It\u2019s been a very exciting World Cup. I\u2019m so glad for Japan. It\u2019s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can\u2019t wait for the final. I\u2019m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother\u2019s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg \u2018If South Africa click, England are in for a torrid time\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final. The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time. I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England\u2019s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.\u201d David Lichtenstein, South Africa"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
