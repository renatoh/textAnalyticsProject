The alliance decided at a meeting in Vienna to deepen its production cuts after reining in output for three years to prevent an oversupply of crude from dragging down prices. The 14-member cartel and its allies havewill toughen their target next year from a cut of 1.2m barrels a day below the group\u2019s production rate in October 2018, to 1.7m. The pact spurred a rapid rise in the price of oil from lows of $62.80 a barrel in the early afternoon on Friday to more than $64.50 a little over an hour later. The price is well above the lows of $50.57 a barrel last December, but below the highs of $74.94 a barrel in April this year. Opec members are expected to bear the brunt of the cut, by reducing production by 340,000 barrels a day, while its allies \u2013 led by Russia \u2013 will make up the balance. A flood of new oil production is expected next year, far outpacing the sluggish growth in demand. Opec has been cutting output since oil prices plummeted to 13-year lows in early 2016. Manuel Salvador Quevedo Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of Opec and Venezuela\u2019s oil minister, said the market was in a \u201cperilous condition\u201d in 2016 and remained at risk. \u201cWe have been on a long and eventful journey since those dark days,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we continue to face various challenges and critical uncertainties that are beyond the capacity of any one stakeholder to influence. There have been trade-related issues, geopolitics and disruptions to security of supply.\u201d Saudi Arabia is expected to shoulder the bulk of the responsibility for reining in Opec oil output, but the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, urged Opec\u2019s members and allies to exercise stricter compliance with . The Saudi prince told delegates in Vienna that the oil cartel is \u201clike a religion\u201d. He said: \u201cIf you are a believer you have to practice. Without practice you are an unbeliever. I do not assume that anyone here in this room is an unbeliever, but I would reiterate to our friends that further commitment and further conformity would allow us all the benefit.\u201d He added: \u201cThe market will have to trust us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
