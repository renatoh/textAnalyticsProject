Spearheaded by Chris Froome and the defending champion Geraint Thomas, the world\u2019s toughest sports event, over 2,100 miles in 21 stages, has been won six times in seven years by British cyclists, a record that compares more than favourably with nations within the European heartland of the sport. The team that has forged this record is one with British roots and an international roster, Team Sky from 2010 to this spring, when the satellite broadcaster was replaced by petrochemicals firm Ineos. The richest team in the sport will again be the centre of attention in France throughout July, but Froome\u2019s serious crash on 12 June which robbed him of a chance to vie for a fifth Tour win has completely changed the equation. Suddenly, every team with its sights on the Tour stopped pondering how to deal with two potential winners at Ineos, plus a strong outsider in the Colombian Egan Bernal. Instead, the great unknown for those teams is whether Thomas has it in him to win a second Tour and how his potential rivals can turn Froome\u2019s absence to their advantage. The stage is set for a Tour where anything can happen. In some ways, this is a compliment to Froome, reflecting the grip he and his team have taken on the world\u2019s toughest bike race. He is such a mild-mannered character, and he spends so much time below the radar outside the month of July, that when Tour de France time comes around, his dominance has always come as something of a surprise. However, the scale of that dominance cannot be underestimated. All multiple Tour winners have a psychological power over their fellow competitors which is enhanced as they win more often, gaining more experience in managing the race, gauging their efforts and calculating the physical state of the opposition. As a result, this year\u2019s Tour suddenly has the complexion of the 1976 and 1983 races which followed the unexpected withdrawals of Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault respectively. Thomas will start as favourite to win the Tour again, but he has been playing catch-up this year after kicking back a little too far following last year\u2019s victory. He was kept under wraps until the final warm-up race, the Tour of Switzerland, meaning his form was impossible to judge. He will be a more confident leader than in 2018, but last year he had Froome in support for almost all of every mountain. There are few things more intimidating for the opposition than knowing the rider they are attempting to shake has the best Tour specialist riding shotgun; there will be none of that this July. Thomas can call on the support of Bernal, who finished 15th last year, and is tipped as a future Tour winner. There is always, however, the risk that Bernal will feel ambitious on his own account. What of the opposition, who will be rubbing their hands while publicly expressing their sympathy for Froome? The Slovenian Primoz Roglic is absent after a tough Giro d\u2019Italia but otherwise the usual suspects are all set. Adam Yates had a successful spring after his disappointing 2018, but has yet to make the leap from fourth in 2016 to the podium. Vincenzo Nibali arrives after his second place in the Giro, but may struggle to hold his form until late July. The Movistar \u201ctrident\u201d of Mikel Landa, Alejandro Valverde and Nairo Quintana flopped in 2018 and look barely more promising so far. For France, Thibaut Pinot broadened his register by winning the Tour of Lombardy Classic last year, but it is five years since he figured on the Tour\u2019s podium. Romain Bardet fights hard but has plateaued since 2016. Richie Porte of Australia has never quite lived up to his initial promise and has a tendency to fall off at inopportune moments. Froome\u2019s crash is not the only one to leave the Tour without one of its stars. At the Giro on 14 May, the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin fell on a rain-hit finish at Frascati, severely cutting a knee; he headed for home the next morning before the race had even reached the official start point. Once his Giro had ended, he turned his sights on the Tour. But Dumoulin, the only dangerman who might have gained time on Thomas in the Tour\u2019s only solo contre la montre, the 27km in Pau on stage 13, has not recovered in time. His absence only adds to the uncertainty around the outcome of this year\u2019s race. There are other plots, as always. It is not certain that Mark Cavendish will start for Dimension Data, which would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago; if he gets to Brussels he will try to edge closer to Merckx\u2019s record of 34 stage wins, amid speculation over quite how far behind him his best days might be. With or without Cavendish, the switch of generations among the sprinters will continue as Marcel Kittel considers his future. Peter Sagan is under pressure for a seventh victory in the points prize after a slow start to the year. The world No 1 Julian Alaphilippe is France\u2019s best hope for stage wins and will be favourite for the mountains prize with a stellar 12 months behind him. His predecessor in the measled vest, Warren Barguil, remains desperately on the comeback trail. In terms of the route, the trend for chopping the time trials and beefing up the mountain stages continues, with an epic amount of climbing over 2,500m above sea level this year. The organisers had hoped the route would make for a more open Tour with constant suspense, but in reality what happens in the Tour has always been more about the riders than the route. Before Froome\u2019s crash, few would have put money against Brailsford\u2019s men taking a seventh win in eight years. Now, all bets are off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
