The two players were reported to have come to blows at the end of a practice session a week ago, with David Luiz said to have taken exception to a challenge from his teammate and to have hit him on the nose. Ceballos tweeted that the tale was \u201cFake\u201d and Arteta, who said any issue had been \u201cresolved immediately\u201d, stated there was no problem between the players. But the manager was concerned that the fact such a story could emerge from his camp may undermine the ethos he is trying to instil. \u201cI don\u2019t like it at all and I will find out where it is coming from,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cAnd if that is the case, that goes completely against what I expect from each other, the privacy and the confidentiality that we need, and there will be consequences.\u201d It is another headache in a fortnight that has brought several new problems Arteta\u2019s way. Willian presented another disciplinary conundrum when taking a journey to Dubai, which was explained as a business trip to fulfil image rights obligations but \u2013 given he was pictured outside a restaurant on social media \u2013 did not present a good look amid Covid-19 travel restrictions. Arteta did not elaborate on whether Willian had been punished, simply saying the situation had been \u201cdealt with in the right way\u201d and the pair \u201chad a conversation and I explained what I expected\u201d. Willian should be available for Sunday\u2019s game at Leeds but Sead Kolasinac and Mohamed Elneny will be missing after testing positive for Covid-19 on international duty. Elneny\u2019s absence is a particular blow given his fellow midfielder Thomas Partey is yet to overcome a thigh injury suffered against Aston Villa on 8 November. Partey\u2019s prognosis is unclear and Arteta said it was \u201can area where we have to be a bit careful and protective\u201d. Losing at home to Villa, having won at Old Trafford the previous week, highlighted the inconsistency that dogs Arsenal 11 months into Arteta\u2019s reign. He accepts any honeymoon may be over and admitted it was tough to absorb such a heavy home defeat with no immediate chance to put things right. \u201cWhen I lose a football game it takes me a week to go through it, so I need another game to go there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we lose it the way we lost it against Villa, it\u2019s even harder because it makes me think about things in the past that I hated and don\u2019t want to see again. There are a lot of things to change and improve. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy road; I said that on the first day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
