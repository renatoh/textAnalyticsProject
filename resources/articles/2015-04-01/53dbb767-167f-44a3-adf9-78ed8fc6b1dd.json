It was a less than convincing victory, however, despite beginning with two early goals. Sampson at least gave a hint of his preferred starting line-up, having said in the build-up to Thursday night\u2019s game that he would select \u201cthe best team\u201d to face China \u2013 or at least the best available as three regulars, the defenders Steph Houghton and Lucy Bronze plus the winger Karen Carney, were missing through injury. Sampson made only two changes from his team\u2019s previous match, the 1-0 victory over Canada in last month\u2019s Cyprus Cup final, Jade Moore replacing Carney and Fran Kirby taking over from Lianne Sanderson up front. Kirby impressed alongside her partner Jodie Taylor, each of them scoring in the first 10 minutes, but after the striker Wang Shanshan\u2019s 17th-minute reply England\u2019s play was often disjointed as they failed to build on a fine opening spell. \u201cIt was an important result for us,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cWe wanted to maintain momentum after our success in Cyprus and against a very difficult Chinese team we were outstanding in spells, especially in the first 15 minutes when we scored twice and should have scored four.\u201d Sampson used six substitutes during a game that left him still pondering his World Cup squad selection, admitting he was \u201cnowhere near\u201d whittling down a list of what he regards as 35 players with a \u201crealistic chance of selection\u201d in the final 23. \u201cThere\u2019s [still] a huge opportunity for players to fight for a place,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of WSL [Women\u2019s Super League] football to be played between now and the tournament, so players can play their way in \u2013 or potentially play their way out. The players need to feel that pressure, to understand how important performance levels are between now and the tournament and make sure they\u2019re in the best possible position to get selected. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear to them that they really have to push themselves. If you look at the history of England squads or World Cups in general, there\u2019s always potentially someone there \u2013 look at Harry Kane \u2013 who\u2019s come from nowhere to really stake a claim. If that\u2019s the case it will be a huge bonus to us, and there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d For Kane perhaps read Ellen White, the Notts County striker who was reintroduced to the squad for this game after missing the whole of last season through a cruciate-ligament injury \u2013 though she was given only a couple of minutes\u2019 game time as substitute on Thuesday night, when England went searching for a third goal to kill off the game. They had made the brightest of starts, Taylor bundling in the opening goal from a Kirby cross and then Kirby doubling the lead with a neat turn and shot following good link-up play between Taylor and the captain Jordan Nobbs. Jade Moore wasted a simple chance for a third goal when she shot against a post after the goalkeeper Zhang Yue had miskicked an intended clearance straight into the winger\u2019s path. China pulled a goal back when Wang Shanshan took advantage of a hesitant England defence to head in a Wang Shuang corner. Although England went close again as the midfielder Jill Scott\u2019s header was saved by Yue, China were right back in the game and it took a fine diving save by the goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain to deny the central defender Li Dongna an equaliser four minutes before half-time. Kirby almost restored the home team\u2019s two-goal advantage with a 58th minute shot that forced Yue into a smart goal-line save, but 10 minutes later Chamberlain had to produce another good stop to keep out a Shuang cross-shot. And in the 76th minute Wang Shanshan should have equalised but completely missed her kick from six yards out. Either side might have won the game in the closing stages, but England were worth a victory that took their unbeaten run to five matches and Sampson\u2019s record, ahead of the World Cup, to 14 wins and only three defeats \u2013 to the world\u2019s top three nations \u2013 Germany, USA and France \u2013 in the 19 games since he took charge 16 months ago.
