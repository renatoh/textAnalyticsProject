A transmitter attached to her dorsal fin had not sent out a definitive message for a year and a half. The transmitter that was attached off Cape Cod in August 2013 is roughly half the size of an iPhone and is meant to ping whenever the shark breaks the ocean surface. Great whites can go for long periods without surfacing. Katharine did so off South Carolina in May 2019, according to a map maintained by Ocearch, the group tracking her. This spring, Ocearch said it thought Katharine might have been heard from \u201cabout 200 miles off the coast of Virginia\u201d. But on Monday, the group said she had definitely been recorded, hundreds of miles off the same state. In a post to the Ocearch Facebook page, Dr Bryan Franks of Jacksonville University wrote: \u201cKatharine is alive and well \u2026 Katharine pinged in multiple times yesterday, confirming it was not a fluke.\u201d Tags used on Atlantic white sharks \u201cnormally only send data to us for five years\u201d, Franks said, which meant it was \u201cvery unusual for us to hear from a shark for this length of time, and it\u2019s exactly the type of data that we are looking for to help put together the puzzle pieces or her life, and other [north-west] Atlantic great white sharks like her. \u201cKatharine showed movement patterns indicative of being a reproductively mature female white shark with trips during some winters out into the open ocean. \u201cHer tracks over the past seven years up and down the coast from Cape Cod to Florida and with long forays to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the offshore Atlantic, may cover the movements of two or three cycles of pregnancy and birth of her pups. \u201cShe has already provided an incredible dataset with more than 1,700 locations, covering 37,000 miles of ocean since the day she was tagged. It will be fascinating to see where her next moves may be.\u201d Some have criticised Ocearch\u2019s use of social media to publicise their work. Others point out that it raises the profile of a vital conservation effort. Katharine was named for Katharine Lee Bates, the 19th-century lyricist who wrote America the Beautiful. After the shark resurfaced at an ugly time for American democracy, her Twitter account began tweeting again. \u201cMiss me?\u201d Katharine asked her 62,000 followers, adding, in reference to the coronavirus pandemic: \u201cSo everyone knows YES I was wearing a mask when I came up.\u201d In response to a user who suggested she had resurfaced in time for the presidential election, she wrote: \u201cI mean. I was chasing a fish, but I\u2019ll roll with it.\u201d On Friday, with the election result stuck in a midnight zone of vote counting and partisan warfare, she added: \u201cSafe to come up again? Ya\u2019ll are having a crazy week up there.\u201d In fact, Katharine is not the most popular great white on Twitter. An account for a shark called Mary Lee has 132,000 followers. According to Ocearch, her transmitter has not pinged since June 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
