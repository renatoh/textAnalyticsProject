Damien French, 20, dropped the large white rabbit into the alligator pond at the Welsh Mountain Zoo in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, last year. French was convicted of animal cruelty after a one-day trial at Llandudno magistrates court. The offence has a maximum penalty of six months in prison. The court heard that French had laughed as the animal was eaten by a large male alligator. French, who is unemployed, had broken into the zoo with two friends, aged 14 and 15, by climbing over a wall. They wandered around for more than two hours on October 9 before entering the alligator house. Once inside, French read a sign explaining that alligators eat small mammals. He said to his friends the alligator \"must be hungry\" before entering the petting area and reaching over a fence into a pen containing two large rabbits. He pulled one out by its ears and walked back to the nearby alligator house. Once inside they stood on a balcony and French dangled the rabbit over the pond, which contained two alligators. He dropped the rabbit and it was attacked immediately by the alligator named Albert, who killed it and kept the body clamped between his jaws. When a young girl entered the alligator house and asked \"is that a rabbit?\", the trio laughed as one replied: \"It was - it was running around 10 minutes ago.\" After leaving the alligator house, the three also threw a lit cigarette to a chimpanzee, and French was seen reaching into an arctic fox enclosure. The maximum penalty for the offence is six months imprisonment and French will be sentenced on April 5. The chairman of the bench, magistrate Alan Roberts, warned him: \"Custody seems a very likely option.\" French, of Colwyn Bay, denied animal cruelty and told police it was the younger of his two friends who was responsible for the rabbit's death. He admitted laughing afterwards but said it was due to shock and he now realised it was not funny. French said: \"I felt as guilty as the others just for being there, but I didn't touch the rabbit.\" But he was found guilty after both boys blamed French and suggested he was angry that the rabbit had scratched his new jacket. Chris Jackson, the zoo's administrative director, said: \"This is a salutary lesson to people who indulge in mindless attacks on defenceless animals. I'm pleased with the verdict and the way the police and Crown Prosecution Service pursued the case.\" After the incident last year, the zoo said staff and visitors had been \"sickened\" by the \"senseless barbarity\" of the rabbit's death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
