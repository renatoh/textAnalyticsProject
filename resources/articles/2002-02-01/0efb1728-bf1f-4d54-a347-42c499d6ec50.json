The \u00a32.5m-a-year deal will make him the highest-paid manager in the league. After two days of discussions with United's chief executive Peter Kenyon, negotiations were put on hold yesterday with Kenyon out of the country. No complications are anticipated before the deal is signed and formally announced early next week, with Roy Keane and David Beckham expected to follow suit and sign new long-term contracts at the club. The England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson yesterday rejected claims that he had held talks with United with a view to succeeding Ferguson. \"I can categorically state that at no stage have I been involved in any negotiations with United either directly or indirectly,\" he said. Meanwhile Ferguson, preparing his side for tomorrow's Premiership game at Charlton, welcomed his Argentine international Juan Sebastian Veron back into the fold and was quick to scotch rumours that the \u00a328.1m midfielder was looking for a return to Serie A after failing to settle in the Premiership. The 26-year-old has not made the expected impact since moving from Lazio in the summer and returned to Rome last week to receive treatment on a niggling knee injury. \"But Veron likes it here very much,\" said Ferguson. \"He has a great rapport with the players and he and his wife socialise with the other lads and their wives. I don't really know what's going on with Lazio. Seba obviously enjoyed his time there and he had a great relationship with the Lazio fans, but I think a lot of the stuff coming out of Italy about him going back is just a smokescreen.\" Veron, who will return to a full-strength squad for the trip to the Valley but is more likely to feature for Argentina against Wales next week than against Charlton, said: \"All I can say, as I've already said and I will again, is that I'm in Manchester, I have a contract and it has never crossed my mind to return to Lazio. \"Many reasons made me decide to come here, like the trouble with the passport. It is true I went to Rome, though that was to get treatment on my knee. I saw some of my former team-mates, Hernan Crespo and Claudio Lopez, but I did not meet with any of the club directors to discuss a possible transfer at all. Right now I intend to complete my contract in England.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
