The latest, as Hong Kong's international races week gathered pace last night, saw Frankie Dettori crowned world champion of Happy Valley. The finer points of working out who is the world's best jockey, on this particular evening decided by points earned on mounts drawn by lot for a three-race series, do not get in the way of the real issue for the gambling-mad local punters. A full house, packed into a seven-tiered stand that appears to have been somewhat carelessly dropped in among a bumper crop of tower blocks, greeted the opening ceremony with mild boredom. As the 12 jockeys were presented to the members of the Great and the Good Society, otherwise known as the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the racecourse did its best to make guests feel welcome with a bout of sustained applause. Unfortunately it very obviously came fresh out of a can. Racing might be the most important sport around here but only as a means of winning money. If you want to get this lot applauding, you have to help them out in their pursuit of winners - and Dettori wasted no time in giving the people the winning favourite they craved with Noble Boy in the first leg, with a rare non-Group One flying dismount for good measure. Yutaka Take had dictated a moderate pace on Me And You but Michael Kinane was happy to hold the rail on Albela. On the run to the home turn the Irishman made his move but the Italian always had Kinane covered and took the lead with 200 metres to run. Dettori hardly shies away from the limelight but his friend Olivier Peslier positively sunbathes in it, and it was the Frenchman who took the curtain calls and maximum points by taking the second leg on Successful Spirit. Dettori's fifth place gave him a two-point lead going into the final leg where another fifth place, on Kindred Spirits, landed him overall victory. On a track that is supposed to favour front runners, last night's deciding race was another victory for those with the priceless ability to keep something up their sleeves. The German Andreas Starke had Huangdi in the lead in the straight when Gary Stevens slipped up the rail on Indubitably Bliss, only for the American to be trumped in turn by the Australian Damien Oliver, who brought Lomond's Fay down the centre. Having just come on from winning a similar world title in Mauritius, Dettori needed no reminding that last night was a bread-and-butter outing - and that the caviar was to come. \"It's a bit of fun tonight,\" he said, \"but I'm looking forward to Sunday because that's where the big races are.\" Having made HK$200,000 (\u00a318,000) for his evening's work Dettori could be in line for the jackpot on Sunday at the former British colony's other track, Sha Tin, where he will ride the Godolphin trio of China Visit, in the International Mile, Ekraar in the Vase and Tobougg in the 10-furlong Cup, the final leg of the Emirates World Series. The three-year-old is out to emulate last year's triumph by his stablemate Fantastic Light. The latest contingent from Sheikh Mohammed's desert strike force had their first gallop on the turf track yesterday morning. \"I think Tobougg is my best chance really,\" said Dettori. \"China Visit could do with a bit of rain and Ekraar - well, the race looks tough but we'll give it a go.\" Some punters back home were apparently impressed enough for William Hill to cut Ekraar to 11-2 and Tobougg to 4-1. The phrase \"morning glory\" needs no translating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
