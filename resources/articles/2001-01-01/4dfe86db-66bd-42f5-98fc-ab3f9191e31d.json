The organisation said it was also probing claims that several couples had paid to adopt babies advertised on the net but were then left without a child or their money. It follows the sale by baby broker Tina Johnson of the six- month-old twins before they were taken back and sold to Alan and Judith Kilshaw. It emerged that babies are regularly advertised on the web with details of their health, age, and skin and hair colour. Prices start from about \u00a35,000. America is leading the way with a host of adoption web-sites aimed at attracting couples desperate for a child and willing to pay. Last night reports told how would-be parents could click onto any state on a coloured map of America and type in requirements. Within seconds row upon row of children appeared, all apparently waiting for adoption. However, there were comparatively few white, American born babies on the internet market. Most of the new arrivals are flown in from eastern Europe, China, Latin American countries and the former Soviet Union. An indication of the enormous scale of the US baby market can be gauged by www.adopting.org whose logo is a variation on the Michelangelo fresco in the Sistine Chapel. A tiny baby's hand grips a parent's finger against a background of clouds. The site has had 2.1m visitors since it was launched four years ago. It offers information on how to contact US-based international adoption agencies, profiles of prospec tive parents, and adoption advice to single parents. One baby advertised on the website CaliforniaKidsConnection.com is named Elia, a five-year-old described as a \"lovely and energetic\" Hispanic girl who is legally freed for adoption. She is described as having a \"wonderful sense of humour and will keep you laughing\". The advert warns:\"Elia has a cleft palate which impairs her speech. \"She has had two surgeries for her palate and will require more surgery in future. She is in special education classes. Elia needs a loving adoptive home where her special needs will be met.\" Last night Liv O'Hanlon, director of the pressure group The Adoption Forum, said she was revolted by the idea of buying a baby over the Internet. \"Adoption over the internet just seems revolting from start to finish,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
