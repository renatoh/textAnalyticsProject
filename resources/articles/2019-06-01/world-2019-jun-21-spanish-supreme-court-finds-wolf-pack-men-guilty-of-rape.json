The case \u2013 known as La Manada, or the \u201cwolf pack\u201d, after the name of the men\u2019s WhatsApp group \u2013 shocked Spain, prompted major protests and provoked a fierce debate over the country\u2019s sexual offences legislation. At the end of their trial in Pamplona in April last year, the five were cleared of gang rape but convicted of the lesser charge of sexual abuse. Under Spanish law, sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. Defence lawyers had claimed the woman had consented and had let one of the men kiss her. They also argued that 96 seconds of video footage from the men\u2019s phones \u2013 showing the woman immobile and with her eyes shut during the attack \u2013 was proof of consent. The prosecution, however, said the victim had simply been too terrified to move. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, Jes\u00fas Escudero and \u00c1ngel Boza were originally sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 probation and ordered to pay \u20ac10,000 each to the woman. Guerrero, a Guardia Civil police officer, was also fined \u20ac900 for stealing her phone. But on Friday, the supreme court in Madrid overturned the lower court\u2019s verdict, ruling that the men had committed rape rather than sexual abuse. It said the victim had been subjected to \u201ca genuinely intimidating scenario in which she never consented to the sexual acts perpetrated by the accused\u201d. Explaining its decision to find the five guilty of rape, the court added: \u201cThis intimidating situation led the victim to adopt an attitude of submission, doing what the perpetrators told her to do, despite the distress and intense strain \u2026 The accused took advantage of this to commit acts against the victim\u2019s freedom, among them at least 10 sexual assaults consisting of oral, vaginal and anal penetration.\u201d Earlier, the public prosecutor Isabel Rodr\u00edguez had argued that violence and intimidation had been used in the assault, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask victims to act in a dangerously heroic way.\u201d The defendants were sentenced to 15 years in prison, forbidden from contacting or approaching the victim for 20 years, and ordered to pay her \u20ac100,000. Guerrero was sentenced to a further two years for the phone theft. The original proceedings had also been criticised because the judges accepted into evidence a report compiled by a private detective hired by some of the defendants. The detective had followed the woman over several days and produced photographs of her smiling with friends. Spain\u2019s acting deputy prime minister and equalities minister, Carmen Calvo, said the supreme court\u2019s decision \u201crecognised the credibility of the victim\u201d. In a tweet, she said the verdict was in line with the government\u2019s proposals to change the law to distinguish between rape and sexual assault, and sexual abuse. Viviana Waisman, the president of the human rights NGO Women\u2019s Link, said the verdict was very important. \u201cIt sends a clear message that judges must apply the law without gender stereotypes and that when victims of sexual violence come forth, they must be believed instead of questioned \u2013 and that the system needs to focus on investigating the accused and not the victims,\u201d she said. The convicted men can appeal to the Spanish constitutional court and then to the European court of human rights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
