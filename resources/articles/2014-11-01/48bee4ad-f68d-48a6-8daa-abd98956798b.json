A DJ is pumping out house music; 800 clubbers in fluorescent gear are jumping ecstatically to the beat. But this is no after-party for survivors from the night before. It\u2019s a Wednesday morning and most people here will soon get changed into work attire and go off to professional jobs, with smiles on their faces and nothing but endorphins in their bloodstream. Welcome to breakfast raving. Welcome to Morning Gloryville. Part exercise craze and part mass party, breakfast raving \u2013 of which Morning Gloryville is said to be the original \u2013 is the new way to start the day, especially for people in their thirties and forties who were part of the original rave generation of the 1990s. The monthly event, which began in London last year, is spreading like wildfire. It is now in 14 cities across the world, from Sydney to San Francisco and Brighton to Bangalore. A monthly Liverpool rave begins on Wednesday. One of those dancing in the east London warehouse is Matt Mayer, 38, who will go from here to his job at a charitable organisation. \u201cI have my first meeting at 10.30,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that coming from this I will be a bit more energised than usual \u2013 I just hope I can get my thoughts back down to earth so I can focus on the work.\u201d It\u2019s Mayer\u2019s first time here. \u201cThe idea is crazy and when my alarm went off at 6.15 this morning, I thought \u2018Why?\u2019 \u201cBut once you come in and you start dancing, you don\u2019t think about anything \u2013 you just go along with it. It\u2019s a better way to start the day than sitting on a bus reading a newspaper, being antisocial and immobile.\u201d The events have themes and today\u2019s motif is Austria, with lederhosen and ski wear aplenty. Drugs and alcohol are strictly out and high-energy smoothies and croissants are in. In a corner a group practises yoga. There are even a few small children running around, brought by their parents. Morning Gloryville\u2019s founder, Samantha Moyo, 28, had the idea when she and a friend were looking for just such an event but couldn\u2019t find one. \u201cIt came from seeking it out,\u201d she says. \u201cI was having the time of my life, partying loads, drinking lots and taking drugs, and it got to a point where it was unsustainable. Then I started meditating and slowing down, but I couldn\u2019t find places where I could have fun and be myself without the alcohol. There weren\u2019t any sober parties.\u201d With her background in immersive events, Moyo believed Morning Gloryville would be a hit, but didn\u2019t expect such a runaway success. \u201cThere are more of these things starting up \u2013 lunchtime raves and copycats. And I\u2019m happy about that, because it\u2019s about bringing people good news \u2013 conscious clubbing.\u201d Most clubbers are professionals aged 30-45, she says \u2013 lawyers, bankers, nurses. \u201cA lot come and say, \u2018Since I\u2019ve had kids I haven\u2019t been able to go out. So this is where I can come and let go.\u2019 But we also have two-year-olds and OAPs.\u201d Anna Levy, 35, a career coach, has come with three friends mixing clubwear with Austrian traditional country clothing. This is her fourth time. \u201cI came first because it sounded mental and I had to see it,\u201d she says. She was worried that it would feel like an exercise class. \u201cBut it\u2019s genuinely like a proper rave. It\u2019s all the pure, upbeat stuff about raving without any of the dark stuff that goes with it.\u201d On the stage, dancers, some stripped to the waist and glistening with sweat, lead the crowd as a rave version of Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive is replaced by a house track chanting: \u201cEat-Sleep-Rave-Repeat.\u201d Improvising alongside is saxophonist Guido Spannocchi, 32. \u201cAs a performer at festivals I sometimes miss playing to people who are sober so they can really appreciate the music. If they are hammered, they enjoy anything. But when you make sober people dance, it really means something,\u201d he explains. Back on the dance floor, sisters Carrie and Kayleigh Curneen, 27 and 29, have their arms in the air. They will go straight from the rave to their office running their own fashion label. \u201cA few friends mentioned it and it sounded really fun,\u201d says Kayleigh. \u201cWe\u2019ve danced at all times of the day, but never super early morning. It\u2019s a different vibe, it\u2019s about getting up, moving and getting motivated.\u201d Carrie adds: \u201cI\u2019m not really a morning person so it was quite a big deal for me to get out of bed at 5.30am. Maybe by 4pm I\u2019ll hit a wall, but at the moment I feel brilliant.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
