The hosts were minutes away from recording a second win this season against the Championship's second-placed side but conceded an equaliser and now find themselves in the relegation zone. That plight is the consequence of eight successive matches without victory \u2014 a run which started after their 2-1 win at Reading on November 22 \u2014 but this was an encouraging effort - with this the most encouraging performance of the lot. Jan Poortvliet's side were industrious and adventurous throughout and took a deserved lead when David McGoldrick, the game's outstanding player, slid the ball under Adam Federici for his eighth goal of the season. Relief reverberated around St Mary's and, as darkness descended, it seemed that victory had been secured. But Reading eventually showed why they are well placed for an immediate return to the Premier League. Sluggish for so long, the visitors sprang into life on 84 minutes when Shane Long emerged from a gang of men in blue and white from a gang of men in blue and white to bundle in Stephen Hunt's free-kick. Soon afterwards it was announced that Doncaster and Nottingham Forest had both won, meaning Southampton enter 2009 in 23rd position. \"It is a concern and we must now react in the new year,\" said Poortvliet. \"We need to play like this every week, with the same belief, with the same passion. If we do that then there will be no problem, but right now we are in a fight.\" As are Reading, who will be nine points off the top should Wolverhampton Wanderess defeat Blackpool tonightwho trail Wolves in the title race. Birmingham remain on their heels and Steve Coppell, having required a late equaliser for a second consecutive match, the manager is aware his players may be losing form at a crucial moment. \"In the end I was grateful for a point,\" he conceded. \"We looked scared to go forward and played in second gear for most of the first half, which isn't like us. But sometimes you have to grind out a result, today was one of those days. Hopefully we can get back to our best soon.\" Man of the match David McGoldrick (Southampton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
