The director general of the BBC took several sideswipes at his old foes at Granada TV at an Advertising Association lunch today, joking that the collapse of ITV Digital and the loss of \u00a3900m was perfect revenge for his failure to fend off Granada's bid for LWT. London's weekend TV company was acquired by Granada in 1994 following one of the most bitterly fought takeover battles in television history. Mr Dyke, who was managing director of LWT at the time, and Sir Christopher Bland, who was LWT chairman, had won a blind bidding competition to retain the licence in the notorious 1992 TV auction. Today Mr Dyke joked that when he joined the BBC he was forced to sell off his remaining Granada TV shares. But he went on to poke a stick at his old enemies. \"And since, then of course, Granada - who you will remember bought LWT in an acrimonious hostile takeover that Christopher Bland and I fiercely contested - have had a tough couple of years, culminating in the death of ITV Digital. As the Italians say: 'revenge is a dish best delivered cold',\" he said to gasps from the audience. \"Of course, Granada shouldn't take all the blame for what happened to ITV Digital - just half of it.\" In a clear reference to the departure of the ITV Digital chief executive, Stewart Prebble, in the immediate aftermath of the venture's collapse, he added: \"We are living in funny times - in the old days, if they lost an awful lot of their shareholders' money, generals fell on their swords. \"These days it's much more common for the generals to award themselves more share options while thrusting their swords into trusted lieutenants.\" Many predict the ultimate demise of several senior executives at Granada and Carlton, including the Granada chief executive, Steve Morrison. Mr Dyke's failure to prevent the takeover of his much cherished LWT franchise in 1994 left a lasting mark on the BBC director general and on those at Granada to have come under fire from him subsequently. Today there was speculation that the personal animosity between Mr Morrison and Mr Dyke may have been one of the factors that led to the clash between ITV and the BBC over the future of digital terrestial TV. Sources say the pair fell out over the future of UK Gold, the BBC-owned channel that broadcasts repeats of BBC and Thames TV shows such as The Bill, EastEnders and Men Behaving Badly. It is believed the corporation wanted to include a free version of UK Gold on the new digital terrestrial network of channels but that Mr Morrison vetoed it. It is also understood the BBC offered to withold the service for five years to allay ITV's fears that a channel that showed such popular programmes would would eat into ITV's audience. \"We all agreed that we need to put some of our differences aside to move forward but they just couldn't agree,\" said one source. \"The bugbear was UK Gold, not any of the other channels in the UKTV package. It is the one that ITV is most scared of,\" said another executive. \"The reason there was a row at the end was because the BBC and ITV both agreed they would take enough bandwidth for four new channels each, but then the BBC turned round and said they wanted six,\" said a senior TV industry source. \"They wanted to put two of the UKTV channels, including UK Gold, out as free to air services.\" The source suggested the BBC was now looking at putting two other subscription channels, such UK Style or Living, on to digital terrestrial as free to air offerings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
