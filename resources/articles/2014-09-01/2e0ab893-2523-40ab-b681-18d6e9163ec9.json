Should Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side manage it on Sunday they would open up an eight-point gap on their rivals with five games played and Manchester City\u2019s defence of the title would be handicapped almost from the outset. The City manager admits Chelsea are likely to be important rivals this season, though not, he thinks, the only ones. \u201cThere will be other teams involved in the race,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham being in the fight but Jos\u00e9 had a very strong squad last year and he has added some good players.\u201d One of those is Diego Costa, currently scoring goals for fun but, like Sergio Ag\u00fcero, kept on the sidelines for most of the Champions League game in midweek through an inability to play too often. Both former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid strikers should face each other in the Premier League encounter, though fitness concerns mean their respective managers are having to use them sparingly. Costa cannot play three games in a week and Ag\u00fcero, who missed a lot of last season and most of Argentina\u2019s World Cup, is having to be nursed gently back into action. What ought to be a showdown between the two most potent strikers in England \u2013 a reasonable billing now that Luis Su\u00e1rez has departed and Radamel Falcao has yet to open his account at Manchester United \u2013 could come down to a question of which one is fit enough to last a full game. \u201cPhysically, Sergio doesn\u2019t have any problems at the moment,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cHe just needs match fitness. When he is 100% fit he will make a difference for us, I am sure about that. Both the times the club have won the title in the past few years goals from Sergio have made the difference. \u201cOn one occasion it was two goals in three minutes. That is the kind of player that we have but I know Costa is a good player too. I knew what he did in Spain and I cannot say I am surprised about what he has been doing in England. Some players you just know will do well in the Premier League. \u201c\u00c1lvaro Negredo was one, Costa is another. The football here suits the way they play, they like it here and that\u2019s why they can score goals from the start. But Chelsea are not just Diego Costa. You have to take care of Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle. Maybe even Didier Drogba.\u201d For all that, Negredo is back in Spain and Stevan Jovetic is injured so, with only two fully fit strikers, one of whom is Ag\u00fcero, Pellegrini does not have a great deal of back-up for the front line. \u201cNegredo is injured, he would not be playing anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have the squad we need and Stevan will be fit next week.\u201d Though hampered by Financial Fair Play restrictions in the summer Pellegrini still managed to spend \u00a332m on a defender and it has not gone unnoticed that Eliaquim Mangala has yet to play a game. \u201cHe has not played since May,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWhy must we start with him immediately when we have two defenders [Vincent Kompany and Mart\u00edn Demichelis] who are playing so well? We thought we needed a good young defender and we concluded Mangala was the correct player to sign but we did not necessarily sign him for the months of August and September. He is for the longer term. He will play when he is ready.\u201d Bayern Munich\u2019s late winner on Wednesday in the Champions League means City picked up one point in their past three games \u2013 not exactly a flying start when Chelsea are unbeaten and have four wins out of four in the league but, as Pellegrini points out, the run of games was a difficult one. \u201cWe had to play Arsenal and then Bayern away from home,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not unhappy about either of our performances in those games. It was just the defeat by Stoke that was unusual. I had some complaints about the refereeing in the Arsenal game, but that is finished with now. I don\u2019t generally like to use referees as an excuse. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with the refereeing in the games against Stoke and Bayern. We just needed to play better. Maybe Bayern didn\u2019t deserve to win the way they did, with that goal in the last minute, but they had other chances and they played better than we did. We played well but we can improve on that and I believe we will in the games to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
