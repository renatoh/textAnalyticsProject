The report by the joint committee on human rights (JCHR) warns that the system designed to identify which children have been trafficked into the UK is flawed, and as a result many children who have been brought here by traffickers, usually to work or for sexual exploitation, are not helped. As a result, the system is failing to prevent child victims of trafficking from endingup in the criminal justice system, accused of committing a crime. Around 1,200 unaccompanied migrant children sought asylum in the UK last year and a total of around 2,150 unaccompanied migrant children were being cared for by local authorities; of these, 550 were under the age of 16. Many children arrive in Kent in very poor health, having hidden in the back of lorries crossing on trains and ferries from France, for the last stage of a long journey which has often been very traumatic. Not all unaccompanied migrant children are discovered or make themselves known to officials, so the real total is unknown. The report warns that there is an inappropriate \"culture of disbelief\" from officials, who are excessively sceptical about the children's accounts of their backgrounds, journeys and their ages. The committee noted that the age of these children is too often disputed, \"putting their welfare and best interests at risk\". It recommends that children should more often be given the benefit of the doubt. Formally declaring a child to be under the age of 18 triggers expensive responsibilities for local authorities, and also means the individual is less likely to be returned to their home country immediately, even if their asylum claim is rejected. The report expresses concern that, because they are liable for the costs of those determined to be children, \"funding pressures could be incentivising local authorities to assess children either as adults, or as older than would otherwise be the case\". Immigration regulations were often found to take precedence over the welfare of the children, the report states, before reiterating that these children are entitled to protection under domestic legislation, and also under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. \"Providing protection and support effectively is crucial: the asylum and immigration process can be complex, and the stress it can cause can be particularly acute for children,\" it states. The report expressed disappointment that the education of these children was not a priority and that too often there were long delays before the children were found school places. \"We saw concerning accounts of the educational provision on offer, and dissatisfaction that children were being hindered in their access to higher education by funding arrangements.\" It calls for the creation of a better support structure for the children \"to help children navigate the asylum and immigration processes\", highlights how legal aid funding is making it harder for the children to get access to good quality legal advice and proposes experimenting with providing the children with guardians to help them have their voices heard. The committee also calls on the government not to return any children to Afghanistan or Iraq while conflict and humanitarian concerns persist. \"There is also an insufficient focus on welfare when making decisions about whether to return children to their country of origin or third countries. The government should affirm that it will not participate in any programme that would return children to countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq where there are ongoing conflict or humanitarian concerns,\" the report states. Hywel Francis, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said: \"Unaccompanied migrant children in the asylum and immigration processes are some of the most vulnerable young people in the United Kingdom. They have often fled conflict situations abroad or have been victims of abuse and exploitation, including those who arrive as victims of trafficking. It is crucial that they are supported effectively. We do not find it satisfactory that immigration concerns are too often given priority when dealing with such children; in doing so the UK is falling short of the obligations it owes to such children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The UK takes its international responsibilities to children seriously and their welfare is at the heart of every decision made. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are always given individual support and reassurance from those in social services and immigration.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
