On the eve of the launch of a special Benghazi committee convened by Republicans with new powers to summon witnesses but dismissed by their opponents as a politically-motivated stunt, a group of five Democrats on the committee claim their report, called \u201cBenghazi on the Record\u201d, tackles the remaining controversies head on. \u201cTo help prevent this committee from becoming another partisan witch hunt, this database clearly lays out many of the questions that have been asked and their corresponding answers,\u201d Washington Democrat Adam Smith told reporters at a press briefing on Capitol Hill. \u201cYou can continue to argue but one thing you can\u2019t argue is that the questions have not been asked or answered.\u201d Led by South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, the special committee is expected to focus on several recent allegations, including those from a group of security contractors working at a nearby CIA annex in Benghazi who claim in a new book they were delayed from rescuing ambassador Stevens and told to \u201cstand-down\u201d by superiors. Though it does not directly contradict or implicate Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, the contractors\u2019 new book is one of a number of sources that have rekindled hopes among some Republicans that the issue may dog her through any possible presidential run \u2013 casting doubt on her competency in office. For their part, Democrats argue that witnesses called to a number of previous congressional hearings have proved there was no \u201cstand down\u201d order. The report cites various military and CIA witnesses who contradict accounts in the recent contractors\u2019 book, claiming that the CIA security team was not prevented from helping, merely that there was a brief delay while they discussed the best way to help. It also quotes Republican intelligence chairman Mike Rogers concluding \u201cit wasn\u2019t even a dispute \u2013 it was the commander on the ground making a decision. I think it took 23 minutes before they all, including that commander by the way, got in a car and went over and rescued those individuals.\u201d The security contractors, argue on the other hand, that the delay was at least 30 minutes, and could have contributed the death of ambassador Stevens. California Democrat Linda Sanchez also criticised \u201cthe amount of time and resources\u201d dedicated to investigating questions that she said have already been answered conclusively. \u201cIncluding the Accountability Review Board, seven different committees have issued nine separate reports,\u201d she said. Democrats are reluctant to publicly criticise the new special committee as partisan but claim their study will help it avoid \u201cre-litigating\u201d past claims, such as the disputed allegation that the State Department deliberately downplayed the terrorist aspects of the attack for political reasons. \u201cMy hope is that our efforts here \u2013 with \u2018Benghazi on the Record\u2019 \u2013 will help the select committee define its scope,\u201d said Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House oversight committee. \u201cWe need to make full use of all the extensive investigations that have come before us. We need to avoid duplication, conserve taxpayer dollars, and help improve the security of US facilities and personnel around the world.\u201d Nevertheless, Republican critics continue to find fresh ways of airing the dispute, helped in part by close attention from Fox News which has aired segments on the consular attack more than 1,100 times according to the liberal press watchdog Media Matters. House Democrats behind the report also criticised aspects of the administration\u2019s handling of the attack, pointing out for example that several reviews had found that \u201cfailures of leadership and management deficiencies\u201d at the state department were to blame for inadequate security. They are adamant that the report is not intended as a defence of Clinton or the administration, although the majority of its conclusions do seek to show that Republican criticisms have been adequately addressed in earlier investigations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
