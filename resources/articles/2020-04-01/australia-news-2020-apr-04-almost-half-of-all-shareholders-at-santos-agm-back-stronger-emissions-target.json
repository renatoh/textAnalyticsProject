Ethical investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the level of support for a shareholder-led climate resolution was unprecedented, and showed large institutional investors had \u201cwoken up to the damage a growing gas industry is wreaking on the planet\u201d. The centre moved two resolutions. Firstly, that Santos set targets aligned to the goals of the Paris agreement for its direct emissions and the indirect \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions released by consumers of its products, and secondly that it review its industry association memberships. The motions received 43% and 46% support at Santos\u2019 annual general meeting , was held online on Friday due to the coronavirus pandemic. Both resolutions were backed by several large proxy advisers and superannuation funds, but opposed by two Chinese shareholders, ENN Ecological Holdings and Hony Capital, that control about 30% of shares. The resolutions were not officially put to the meeting after a push to change the constitution to allow advisory resolutions was unsuccessful, but were acknowledged by Santos\u2019 chairman, Keith Spence, who read out the vote results. The centre\u2019s Dan Gocher said it showed there was strong support for fossil fuel companies to set targets to limit not just their own emissions, but those that result from their goods. He said many of Santos\u2019 peers, including BP, BHP and Royal Dutch Shell, had committed to scope 3 targets. \u201cThese results show how much of a laggard Santos is on climate change,\u201d Gocher said. \u201cThe onus is now on institutional investors to ensure that their vote is not ignored. Santos should immediately move to implement the review and disclosure measures recommended in the two resolutions.\u201d Spence told the meeting that while the resolutions had been rejected, it was clear that climate change was an important issue to our shareholders. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is personally important to me as well,\u201d he said. \u201cOur company is already taking industry-leading action towards emissions reduction, and we will continue to engage constructively with shareholders on climate change, and work towards our shared aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 over the coming year.\u201d Santos has a target of cutting emissions by more than 5% by 2025 and an aspirational goal of net zero emissions by 2050, but aims to lift gas production by 60% over the next five years. Gocher said it was untenable for Spence to maintain his opposition to setting a target for scope 3 emissions \u201cgiven the clear signal sent by his shareholders\u201d. Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said oil and gas companies had been told for years that investors expected them to address climate change in line with the Paris agreement. \u201cThe question now for Australian companies like Santos and Woodside is whether they are matching their European counterparts, who increasingly recognise that a strategy for a diversified business beyond pure fossil fuel extraction is required to reduce climate risk and provide long-term value for investors,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
