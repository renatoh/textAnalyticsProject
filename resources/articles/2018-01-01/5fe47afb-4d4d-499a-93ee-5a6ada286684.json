But the boy from Beverley knows the time has come to let loose his inner beast if he is to do what no one except those close to him thought was possible until the past few days: reach the final of the Australian Open on Sunday. Standing in his way in the semi-finals is Marin Cilic, the experienced, sometimes brilliant but often brittle Croatian, who is No 6 in the world and won their only previous match, 6-3, 7-6 (5) in the second round of the Shanghai Masters last year. They are both admired and liked in the locker room but it is Edmund who has intrigued strangers in Melbourne with his impeccable manners and humble demeanour. Those who know him best say what you see is the real Edmund, an understated Yorkshireman who arrived in the county 20 years ago with his South African mother and Welsh father, and set about sating his obvious sporting appetite. Russell Parker, who was his tutor and head of sport at school \u2013 where cricket and swimming first caught his attention \u2013 told the Hull Daily Mail: \u201cKyle was, and still is, a lovely young man. He was a natural all-rounder at sport but, what really set him apart, even then, was his tenacity and will to win.\u201d Edmund said of the perception of him, \u201cIt\u2019s your job. There are quite a few players, in my opinion, who act one way off the court and act another way on the court. When you are in a competitive environment, you do stuff differently. I don\u2019t know too many players who are exactly the same on and off the court, so I think it\u2019s just how it works.\u201d But he does appreciate the passion of his extrovert Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, who spends most of his matches on his feet screaming his head off. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have someone in your corner who is really engaged like that. At the same time it has to come internally from yourself, that drive and that firepower. All the guys in my box, I believe in them. It is good to look over and see they are pumped for you, especially when you get in those close moments at the end of sets \u2013 that\u2019s when you can feed off them and become really gritty and tough to beat.\u201d Fame has come gradually to Edmund, who spent years striving in the shadow of Andy Murray \u2013 a place he felt perfectly comfortable, by the way. When the former world No 1 invited him to his off-season training camp in Miami, Edmund knew it was akin to an anointment from the best player these islands have produced. But away from even that peripheral glare, Edmund toiled in unglamorous surroundings \u2013 and lived for several years in digs at the National Training Centre in Roehampton. \u201cYou think about that sometimes,\u201d he says, \u201chow far you\u2019ve come. But you don\u2019t awe over it, you just get on with it. From 16 to 20 I was staying at the NTC. London is an expensive place to live so until I could get my own place that was the option. That\u2019s what you have to do growing up. Then, I guess, the perks come later. But you\u2019ve got to earn it. It\u2019s great for me but also for my family, who are really close to me \u2026 all the years they sacrificed to watch, to see me do well, is worth it.\u201d Did he ever feel homesick or lonely on tour? \u201cNo. If I didn\u2019t like it, I would stop it straight away. No one forces me to do it. That\u2019s the great thing about my parents: they never forced me to do anything. They were very supportive of me and my decisions. I\u2019ve lived away from home since I was 13. Come 20, you get used to it. \u201cYou miss home but that\u2019s why you do these things, because you want to reach the pinnacle of your sport. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. You have to trust the process and do the best you can.\u201d And the best he could do the past 10 days has landed him up in the semi-final of a grand slam against Cilic, a seasoned campaigner who has won a slam \u2013 the US Open in 2014 \u2013 and has shown flashes of his pedigree across the tour since 2010, when Murray stopped him in Melbourne at this point of the tournament. Murray, who has slipped to No 20 in his enforced absence and whom Edmund will pass in the rankings if he reaches the final \u2013 will be watching his friend and protege again at home in Surrey, no doubt with his finger hovering over his Twitter button. There is at least a decent chance his reaction will be the same thing he tweeted when Edmund outlasted the world No 3, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarter-finals: \u201cWow!\u201d The boy from Beverley has moved to the Bahamas, where the weather and tax are more amenable, but he surely knows his Yorkshire roots. The last player from Beverley to make a noise in the tennis world was an amateur called Dr John Gregory. In 1929, he made the long boat journey to Melbourne to compete in the Australian Open \u2013 and won it"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
