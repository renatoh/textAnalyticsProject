If Therese Jacobsen was disappointed at the timing of her boyfriend's prosaic question, she cheered up yesterday. After initially protesting that she had not had a practice round with him and that she had not even got a yardage book, she agreed to take the bag, Yesterday Carter attributed her presence to his relaxed state of mind, a four-under par 68 and a presence on the leaderboard only two shots behind the leader Greg Owen and one behind Ian Woosnam. Carter, who with Nick Faldo won the World Cup for England in 1998, said: \"Sometimes a man and a woman working together is a good thing. Men often try to rush into things on the golf course and women are a lot calmer.\" If the old army assertion that time spent in reconnaissance is never wasted, then we should at least be glad that 10 of the team who will contest the Ryder Cup over this course, from September 27-29, are playing this event. But one or two of them overlooked a few craters and took some wrong turnings: the team's performance, taken collectively, was not good. They were a total of 10-over par, none of them broke 70 and only one, Nicolas Fasth, equalled it. Thomas Bjorn, Padraig Harrington, Phillip Price and Colin Montgomerie had 71's, Bernhard Langer was level, but the other four were over par. The most disappointing, by far, both on and off the course, was Lee Westwood. It is quite extraordinary how his game has disintegrated since 2000, when he was Europe's No1. Last year he finished 52nd in the order or merit and this year he is a distant 74th. Yesterday he had a 79, the worst of the Ryder Cuppers. But when asked by a group of journalists, all of them sympathetic to his cause, to have a brief word he had an even briefer word for them: \"No\", and he walked off. Sweden's Pierre Fulke was only two strokes better and is another who has lost form since qualifying for the team. Yesterday he finished bogey, double-bogey, double-bogey for a homeward half of 43. The others over par, Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley, were on 74 and both admitted that they deserved no better. The game's two ruling bodies, meanwhile, the Royal and Ancient and the United States Golf Association - who had differed over the new technology that produced the \"hot\" driver - have found a way round their impasse. Drivers like Callaway's ERCII, illegal in the US but legal in Europe, will be usable everywhere from January 1 2003 until December 31 2007. Then the rules will be changed again, to make the ERCII, and others like it, illegal. Those conditions will apply to club golfers, but the ruling bodies are to introduce a \"Condition of Competition\" for 2003 and beyond for what they term \"highly skilled players\". This will make the use of \"hot\" drivers illegal in the Open championships of the two countries and, the R&amp;A says, it will recommend the introduction of the condition \"for all events on the major professional tours\". The effect will be to allow club players with \"hot\" drivers to use them until the end of 2007, while professionals will have to use standard drivers as from next year. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
