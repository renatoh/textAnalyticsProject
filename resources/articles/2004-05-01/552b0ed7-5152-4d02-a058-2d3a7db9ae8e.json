The club's directors emerged from a five-hour board meeting at Anfield yesterday to confirm they would not be taking up the 51-year-old building magnate's offer on the grounds that, in its current guise, it effectively valued the company at around \u00a361m. The chairman David Moores and his board consider Liverpool to be worth nearer \u00a3150m. Though the door has not been slammed shut on Morgan, it is clear that only a substantially increased bid will be considered if he is to realise his dream of gaining a place on the board of the club he has supported since childhood. The Jersey-based businessman reacted with bewilderment last night, the impetus appearing to have swung back firmly behind the alternative proposal put forward by Thailand's prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Confirmation of Liverpool's rebuff of his \"grand vision\" will come as a major blow to Morgan, the club's third largest shareholder with a 5% stake but a figure who has long endured a fractious relationship with Moores. An initial proposal worth around \u00a350m was rejected in March. Under his revised scheme, launched at a press conference last Thursday, the club's existing shareholding - 35,000 shares valued at around \u00a34,000 each, generating a total of nearly \u00a3150m - would have been restructured to leave 35,000 shares at \u00a31,750 each. That would have valued the club at just over \u00a361m, with the potential \u00a373m raised by rights and shares issues - to be underwritten by Morgan's company Bridgemere Investments Ltd - to be invested in both the playing staff and the move to a proposed \u00a3120m, 61,000-seat stadium on Stanley Park. Yet Liverpool, in discussion with their financial advisers Hawkpoint Partners Ltd, considered that plan to have seriously undervalued the club. \"The board notes that the Bridgemere proposal, at \u00a31,750 per share, implies a current value of \u00a361m for the entire club which is a substantial discount to the value placed on the club by the board,\" confirmed Liverpool in a statement. \"The board has therefore concluded that the Bridgemere Proposal, as currently constituted, is not attractive.\" A spokesperson on Morgan's behalf countered: \"The board's response doesn't seem to make sense. His proposal is to underwrite the investment of \u00a373m into Liverpool, not buy the club. Under his proposal the investment would be open to all shareholders, including the board. Mr Morgan's offer merely underwrites the pro posal, thereby guaranteeing that \u00a373m will be made available to the club. What matters to Liverpool is how much money they have available to strengthen their squad and fund the stadium.\" Liverpool remain hopeful there could yet be grounds for compromise, particularly with public support firmly behind the Garston-born construction tycoon. A poll in a local newspaper on Merseyside yesterday indicated that 87% of those asked preferred taking up Morgan's option as opposed to that of Thaksin. While no decision has been taken on the bid by the Thais - whereby a stake of just under 30% would be bought for around \u00a356.5m, in proportion to Liverpool's valuation - the rejection of Morgan's offer will have been welcomed by the manager G\u00e9rard Houllier. The Frenchman has been upset by the prospective investor's attack on his management style and record in the transfer market. \"It has been written that Steve Morgan wants a new manager and that I'm in the sixth [year] of a five-year plan,\" said Houllier, whose side have all but secured fourth place in the Premiership and a chance to qualify for the Champions League. \"That is mischievous because I have only been in charge for five years. In those five years we have qualified for the Uefa Cup in the first year and last year, and for the Champions League the other years. \"We have managed to get six trophies. The signings have been criticised but, if a club like Liverpool cannot spend \u00a38m or \u00a39m a year to invest, it is difficult to understand because some clubs have done more. I'm not going to send out a team which is not good enough to represent Liverpool.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
