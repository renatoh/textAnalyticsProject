He used to be in the Communist party \u2013 and he was not on the moderate wing. Mr Nicholson retains many of the traits of a tankie \u2013 secretive, divisive and with a penchant for central command. It is a mix that has made him many enemies, who are taking the opportunity afforded to them by his embroilment in the scandal of the lethally compromised care at Mid Staffs. On Tuesday MPs hauled him over the coals about those months at the height of the crisis when he was head of the overarching West Midlands strategic health authority. The case against him, made most trenchantly in the Daily Mail \u2013 crusading against the civil servant with the sort of ferocity typically reserved for politicians \u2013 is also echoed privately, in more measured terms, by swaths of the health establishment. And this case is serious. He was indeed at the wheel when the worst happened, and \u2013 given his way of intervening left, right and centre, including in notionally independent foundation trusts \u2013 he starts out disadvantaged in brushing off the inevitable scandal questions about who knew what when. He was fortunate on Tuesday that dogged political opponents, such as Chris Skidmore, were absent. His claims about the imperfect management information available at the time were not a convincing way to draw a line under Mid Staffs tales of receptionists, with no medical training, performing the literally vital task of triage in the A&amp;E of an NHS hospital. Mr Nicholson is, however, entitled to point out that such things were not found in any of the dozens of other hospitals under his watch. Ministers have frequently walked for catastrophes with less serious consequences, and occasionally for affairs in which they have played a less direct role, but a dogged official in the Nicholson mould would \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 ordinarily expect to brazen this out. What complicates his position is the sense that he embodies a mistrusted target culture, a culture which everyone can agree has its perversities, and which market-minded \"reformers\" single out as the root cause of the Mid Staffs rot. More generally, after six years at the top \u2013 and more especially during the two since the trashing of Andrew Lansley's authority established him as the \"real\" health secretary on the inside \u2013 his top-down approach has come to be tainted by association with every NHS failure, including two distinct but equally dismal reports yesterday on death rates and productivity. But a good deal of this cannot be reasonably by blamed on any one man, even one as powerful as Mr Nicholson: mortality reflects smoking and junk food as much as healthcare, and productivity automatically bobs up and down in weird ways in response to Treasury decisions over spending. The more serious charge is that NHS problems that could and should have been tackled \u2013 such as the regime for failing hospitals and the so-called \"reconfiguration\" of services \u2013 have been allowed to drift. Every manager, provider and regulator that was promised autonomy despairs at this, and despises the man who has \u2013 through all the reforms \u2013 continued to hug all power close. Their feelings are understandable, and Mr Nicholson's record would be unforgivable were it not for the fact that he has been given such as dismal political lead. Norman Lamb's last-minute rewriting of new regulations on commissioning on Tuesday was a welcome half-step back from commercialisation, but the fact that such significant changes are being made weeks before they are operative is typical of the chaos. In such circumstances somebody has to grab the wheel simply to keep the car on the road, and doing that has so consumed the chief executive that, inevitably, the service has recently seen less of the sustained strategic interest that he displayed, for example, over the NHS constitution and the Darzi review. The many flaws of Mr Nicholson should not obscure the reality that in the end it is ministers who must carry the can \u2013 and for good reason."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
