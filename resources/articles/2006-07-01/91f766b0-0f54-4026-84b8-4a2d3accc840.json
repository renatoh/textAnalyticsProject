An industry report published yesterday claims our software industry is \"approaching meltdown\" because of a skills shortage. Since the industry is reckoned to contribute pounds 13 billion a year to the economy, and since most hi-tech developments now have a significant software element, this is a serious matter. The report, Developing The Future, has been prepared by the British Computer Society and Lancaster University with input from eSkills, the Ovum consultancy, the DTI, Amicus and Microsoft UK, which has financed the production. The headline numbers are that there has been a 50% drop in applications for computer-related degrees, a 60% drop in software engineering students and a 47% drop in systems engineering students. In the press release, Matt Bishop, senior director of Microsoft's Developer Platform Group, says: \"Young people no longer regard software as cool.\" Another factor is that the first generation of IT workers is reaching retirement age. However, anyone who reads trade magazines may be surprised that IT workers last long enough to retire. A staple of their letters pages are complaints from programmers who are too old at 35 or 45, or overqualified, or know languages such as Cobol and Fortran, which are now deeply unfashionable. This creates the impression that the IT industry is mainly short of overeducated young people who will work for not much money. Finally, there is the problem of \"off-shoring,\" where the IT industry benefits from the hundreds of thousands of programmers churned out by universities in India and China in particular. The press release concedes that another \"200,000 'basic' jobs will be off-shored by 2010\". It must make any prospective programmer wonder how many of the less-basic jobs will be \"off-shored\" before they reach what the government might consider a reasonable retirement age. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
