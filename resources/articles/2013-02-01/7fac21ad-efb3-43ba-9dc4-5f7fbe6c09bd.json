Defended solidly throughout Sergio Ramos 5 The captain was left hopelessly exposed at United's goal, not getting anywhere near Welbeck. Otherwise not troubled too much Rapha\u00ebl Varane 6 Could have been sent off as the last Real man when he chased down Evra in second half but was spared red. Good in the air F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o 7 Hit the inside of a post early on with a superb side-footed effort and played more as a wing-back than full-back Sami Khedira 6 An efficient display by the Germany international, making sure Kagawa had little room to create chances for the visitors Xabi Alonso 7 Usual blend of masterful passing and hard work, with a 40-yarder to Ozil standing out. Stopped Van Persie shot on goalline Angel di Mar\u00eda 8 Started wide on the right but had licence to roam and did so with great effect. Fantastic cross for Ronaldo's goal Mesut Ozil 8 Hardly made a mistake all night and tested De Gea several times with stinging drives from inside and outside the box Cristiano Ronaldo 8 His headed goal was beautiful in its timing and execution. Left Evra no chance with a tremendous leap. Full of running throughout Karim Benzema 5 Saw little of the ball and was not too successful with it but his runs stretched United to set Ronaldo and Ozil free. Replaced by Higua\u00edn Substitutes Higua\u00edn (Benzema, 60) Modric (Di Mar\u00eda, 75) Pepe (Alonso, 83) Manchester United David de Gea 9 Produced a wonderful save to push Coentr\u00e3o's shot on to a post in first half. Denied Portuguese again in second half Rafael da Silva 4 A very difficult evening for the full-back, who struggled with and without the ball. Not only against Ronaldo. Booked Rio Ferdinand 6 A poor clearance led to Coentr\u00e3o's early shot but marshalled defence well after that to deal with Real pressure Jonny Evans 6 In the team instead of Vidic, who was not in squad. Did well, tracking Benzema and dealing with Ronaldo when he burst through Patrice Evra 6 Stranded as Ronaldo scored Real's first but was able to gallop forward on a few occasions to win corners Michael Carrick 7 Covered well on several occasions when United's defence struggled with the sheer amount of Real players going forward Phil Jones 8 Superb for large parts, helping out here, there and everywhere. A push on Di Mar\u00eda could have led to Real penalty \u2013 but it didn't Danny Welbeck 7 Brilliant header for the goal, only his second in 28 games, and nearly scored a second but effort was just wide. Tireless Wayne Rooney 7 A selfless display out on the right, he had to help Da Silva against Ronaldo. His corner led to Welbeck's goal after 20 minutes Shinji Kagawa 5 Struggled to get to the ball as Khedira and Alonso took turns in blocking him off. Not his night and was rightly substituted Robin van Persie 7 Had to play on his own up front and was often forced wide but hit bar in second half and had one effort cleared off the line Substitutes Giggs (Kagawa, 64) Valencia (Welbeck, 73) Anderson (Rooney, 84)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
