But this was the experience of David Radler, right-hand man of the former owner of the Daily Telegraph, Lord Black, who recently admitted to multiple charges of fraud in a Chicago court. His host at that historic Downing Street reception was Margaret Thatcher, a devoted admirer of Lord Black, who acted as his sponsor when he was finally admitted to the House of Lords all togged up in ermine. Black himself is likely to face fraud charges now that Radler has decided to spill the beans. The latest news from Chicago is a further reminder of the fact that criminality has never been a stranger to the neocons, and their agenda, which included the invasion of Iraq. Another of Black's business colleagues was Richard Perle, a director of Hollinger International, who was forced to resign as a Pentagon adviser to George W Bush after investing in security companies, with the help of Black's money. Perle was one of the main architects of the US policy towards Iraq. He was helped in his endeavours by his close ally, Iraqi exile Mr Ahmed Chalabi, like Radler, a fraudster, who supplied the Pentagon with false information about the situation in Iraq and who is now the country's deputy Prime Minister. Blair humiliated The ancient Greeks would have found nothing unusual in events at the Labour party conference in Brighton last week. According to their laws, hubris, or the display of overweening ambition and pride, was inevitably followed by the offending person's downfall. To spectators of the conference, the events were as satisfying to watch as any ancient drama. On Tuesday, Blair had made his conference speech. Shiny-faced and self-confident, he was given the customary standing ovation. His wife, Cherie, was at his side, appearing to gloat over the discomfiture of Blair's rival, Gordon Brown. Even the journalists seemed to be impressed by the slick performance. Then came nemesis in the unlikely shape of an 82-year-old man who had dared to heckle Blair's faithful Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, and was bundled out of the hall by a couple of heavies. At a stroke, the triumph of the previous day was forgotten and Blair and his colleagues tried to redeem the situation by vying with one another over who could make the most effusive apology to Mr Wolfgang. Yet even here, the weaselly evasions of Blair's thinking seemed to be at work. 'I was not in the conference centre at the time myself,' he told an interviewer. What was that supposed to mean? Not that he had failed to see what had happened, because by then it had been endlessly repeated on television. No. What he was trying to suggest was that if he had been there, things might have been different. Who knows - he might even have stepped in to stop Mr Wolfgang being thrown out. It only made things worse, reinforcing the obvious fact that to the delight of many others, he had come a cropper. Brown's blather With his 'moral compass' and devotion to truth, proclaimed in his conference speech, Gordon Brown has shown he is just as much given to pious humbug as Blair. To illustrate his moral credentials, Brown has always made a point of criticising the best universities for their alleged failure to admit more students from state schools, an easy way of avoiding recognition of the failure of the state schools themselves. The most recent criticism has focused on the Royal Academy of Music as being the worst offender when it comes to state school admissions - only 48 per cent of the intake. But the academy has quite rightly insisted that its policy has always been to admit the most talented on merit alone. And when education is generally thought of in purely economic terms, as it now is, it is not surprising that music should have been placed low in the order of priorities. Learning to play the cello or the flute is not going to help Britain compete on equal terms with its European partners. Is there also a bias against such activities on the grounds that they are in some way elitist? The same charge has been made to explain the decline of cricket at state schools. Whatever the truth, the official response will be to put the blame on institutions such as the academy, emphasising the expression 'children from poor backgrounds' rather than children from poor schools. In this way, ministers like Brown will hope to minimise unhelpful criticism of the state education system itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
