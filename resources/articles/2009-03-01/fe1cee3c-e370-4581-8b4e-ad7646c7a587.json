The continent would be better off if the flow were stopped and Africa were left to tackle the challenges of development through a liberalised world in which the private sector called the shots. Here in Zambia we are surprised that Moyo appears to make such a blanket critique of aid in Africa. Her insufficiently developed account of aid does not give a just picture of the role that aid plays and can play if improved upon. Africa has many different stories to tell, some good, some bad \u2013 so more discrimination would be appreciated. The cold war did Africa no favours with a \"my enemy's enemy is my friend\" approach to aid from the US and the USSR, and the top-down conditionality-heavy approach of the World Bank in the 1980s and 1990s did not work either. But we have moved on, and we have learned that growth is not the same as development. Growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for development \u2013 and, yes, foreign direct investment really does help to promote growth. But it does not deliver antiretrovirals to people with HIV/Aids, or bed nets to protect children from malaria, and it does not deliver the education for future generations of Africans. Last year an international report, Achieving the Millennium Development Goals in Africa, recorded improvements in health, education and infrastructure in Africa. It noted, however, that progress was too slow, and called for more and better co-ordinated aid, not less. On education, for instance, it pointed out that several African countries are on track to achieve universal primary education by 2015 because of effective support programmes. At the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection (JCTR) in Lusaka, where we deal on a daily basis with specific, practical obstacles to effective development and the challenges of aid, the assumption that the private sector and economic growth can be an alternative to aid is immensely problematic. Before the financial crisis, Zambia managed to achieve three consecutive years of growth above 5%. The mining sector revived in response to Chinese demand, and foreign direct investment grew on the back of increasing investor confidence. But unfortunately, at the same time, rural poverty was increasing, social protection expenditure was being reduced and the cost of living, monitored on a monthly basis by JCTR, was rising. And success brought its own problems, as the UN conference on trade and development (UNCTAD) pointed out in 2007, with the exchange rate hitting Zambian exports. Now, in 2009, the economic crisis is upon us. Copper, which supplies 80% of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings, is trading at about a third of its price only eight months ago. We are now seeing all too clearly that the benefits of economic growth did not trickle down to the majority of the population: poverty will increase, aid flows are likely to continue decreasing, job losses will rise, the government's ability to provide even the most basic levels of assistance will be very limited and private sector investment flows will dry up. Like many countries dependent on natural resources, Zambia is experiencing a classic boom and bust cycle \u2013 and is suffering the consequences. Such countries typically fail to save enough in the boom years or, even worse, borrow too much against uncertain future revenue. It is not aid that lands us in this predicament but the private sector and the pursuit of an unsustainable model of economic growth that fails to address the deep-seated problems of development and poverty. It is not an either/or question. We need the right blend of aid and a balanced model private sector development that is built on good corporate social responsibility and distributes the benefits of economic growth more widely. We do not claim that there are no problems with aid, and indeed we recognise that the aid system employs some of our most able people, depriving government and the private sector of their skills and commitment. But there has been progress, even if it is painfully slow. Thanks to aid, across Africa there has been a big increase in the number of children protected from malaria by sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets; more than three million HIV-positive Africans are receiving life-saving antiretroviral treatment, up from just a few thousand in 2002; and primary school enrolment increased from 51% in 1990 to 71% in 2006. The answer is not to cut aid, but to ensure it is used effectively. In a country where the people endure bad health because of a lack of healthcare resources, have no access to education, and lack skills, it will not be possible to narrow the gaps of inequality. Bridging the urban rich and rural poor divide or protecting and promoting the welfare of vulnerable groups requires additional resources that the government does not have and the private sector is unable to provide. Moyo ends her book with the African proverb, \"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second time is now.\" As a Zambian living in Zambia, I would add that she needs to be mindful where this seed is planted. Not every seed for a fruitful tree will grow in any soil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
