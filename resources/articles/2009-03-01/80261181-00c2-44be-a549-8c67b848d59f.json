When asked by the former England captain Nasser Hussain: \"What about the ICC World Twenty20 in England, if they say, 'Kevin, look, we desperately need you to captain'?\" Pietersen replied: \"No.\" Pietersen also told Hussain that, if he was approached to be the England captain again, \"I'd have to think long and hard about doing it again because of my personality, because of the way I like to do things... We'll have to wait and see. If it gets chucked at me, I'll have to do a lot more thinking than the first time I took it over.\" On Andy Strauss, who replaced him as England captain when he resigned in January, he said: \"Straussy's been great. He batted fantastically well and I said before there's never going to be a problem with Straussy. At the helm he's done a fantastic job, he's led from the front, he's scored some great hundreds and he's a nice guy, so you can't ask for more.\" He added that he had not had an issue with Strauss taking over and said: \"I knew deep down the truth about what had happened, I knew the real truth about what people had said to me, so I had no issues with any of the players. I had no issues with Straussy taking over. I had issues with other departments of the management but I didn't have any issues with players and the people that have taken us on the trip.\" NH: \"Are the players being kept up to date on the coach situation?\" KP: \"Not really, no.\" NH: \"What's your opinion on Andy Flower? You had one opinion a few months ago. Have you changed your mind a little bit?\" KP: \"He's doing an OK job here. I just think we need to get some results. We have to get some victories to give Petals [Flower] the best opportunity at getting the job. I think it will be very tough for him if we keep losing... I'm just going to have to make do with whoever comes into the job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
