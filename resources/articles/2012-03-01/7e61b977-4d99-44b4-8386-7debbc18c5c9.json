Su\u00e1rez addressed doubts over his future in English football in an interview with the Montevideo-based newspaper El Pa\u00eds earlier this week, when he revealed he was \"very happy\" at Liverpool and open to the club's idea of renewing a contract that does not expire until 2016. Paris St-Germain and Juventus are among several clubs to have been linked with Su\u00e1rez since he received an eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra and Dalglish, who may not be able to offer Champions League football next season, has welcomed the striker's show of faith. \"It's encouraging for everybody,\" said Dalglish. \"It might be bad news for other Premier League teams but it is encouraging for us. We've been delighted with him since he has been here. \"Luis has made a contribution every time he has stepped out on to the football pitch. He scores goals and creates goals. It's great news that he is happy. But we don't need to go through the full r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of his season, we are delighted with his statement and the content of it.\" Liverpool are expected to plan their summer transfer strategy around Su\u00e1rez but Dalglish insists he has not drawn up his targets yet. Dalglish, who is likely to be without Glen Johnson and Craig Bellamy at QPR on Wednesday night, added: \"We have not got a clear picture in our mind of what we want. The players here have done fantastically well and if anyone is going to come in they will have to be a hell of a player to do better than what they have done. We have not had any discussions about funds. Someone else is in a position to discuss that with the owners and then they will come back and say there's the budget.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
