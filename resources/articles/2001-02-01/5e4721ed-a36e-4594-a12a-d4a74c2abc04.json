My career lasted just under a year. Officer training then was largely at a residential centre, with a brief period at a local prison. I remember a visit to \"Fraggle Rock\", as the section for mentally disturbed prisoners was called. A senior officer proudly showed me his new copy of a Guide to Mental Illness. I also saw an inmate, in extreme distress, lying on his cell-floor, faeces covering the walls and flies circling. During training, there was a heavy emphasis on fitness that almost disappeared once in the post, the average officer carrying a stone or three too many. Prison life is mundane and for much of the time, little happens, the consent of the prisoners making things work. But the physical training is ill-conceived and ineffective. Why spend so much time training people to physically restrain inmates, but none on how to anticipate or diffuse violent situations? But my worst doubts about my career were confirmed by the equal opportunities training section. After a series of talks about legislation, the principal officer taking the session handed around a list of racist and sexist jokes to the all-white group. A sub-text was being conveyed - this is what being a prison officer is really all about. While many prisoners are untroubled by being imprisoned, some are clearly traumatised. One inmate would languish on his bed, gazing up at nothing visible to anyone but himself. He became more and more distanced, muttering to himself, fingers clasped together. Referred to as a \"loony-tune\", he was transferred to Feltham. Yet other inmates reacted with pure fury, hurling abuse at staff or throwing \"shit parcels\" out of their cells at passing officers. But the prison service sets itself up to fail. The training, the culture, the nature of most new recruits, and the under-resourcing of prisons means that rehabilitation of prisoners is a virtual impossibility. Longstanding members of staff present newcomers with ways of doing things that are extremely difficult to break down. These old ways are not always aggressive, neglectful or abusive. However, they are nearly always obstacles to practice in prisons improving. As ever, it is easier to say what is wrong than to suggest how to put it right. But firstly, we - because what happens in prisons happens in our names - have to decide what we want from the prison service. Once we make that decision, then things would have to change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
