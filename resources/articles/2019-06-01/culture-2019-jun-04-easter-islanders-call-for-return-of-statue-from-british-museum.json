Rapa Nui leaders will introduce their visitors to their culture \u2013 but they also want to talk about the possible return of the world-famous statue that has stood in pride of place in the museum\u2019s Wellcome gallery for the last 150 years. \u201cThis is no rock,\u201d said Carlos Edmunds, the president of the Council of Elders, of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, a four-tonne lava rock sculpture carved by the ancient inhabitants of Easter Island that has been kept in the British Museum for the last century and a half. \u201cIt embodies the spirit of an ancestor, almost like a grandfather. This is what we want returned to our island \u2013 not just a statue.\u201d Almost 1,000 statues, known as moai, remain on the island, which local people call Rapa Nui. The museum delegation\u2019s visit comes after members of the island\u2019s development commission, accompanied by Edmunds and Chile\u2019s minister for national assets, Felipe Ward, flew to London in November 2018 to visit Hoa Hakananai\u2019a and request its return. When Commodore Richard Powell arrived on Rapa Nui in November 1868 onboard the Royal Navy frigate HMS Topaze, 20 years before the island was annexed by Chile, Hoa Hakananai\u2019a was buried deep in the earth at the ceremonial village of Orongo on the south-west tip of the island, cloaked by a stone structure. According to contemporary accounts, Powell was shown the statue and sent a working party up to Orongo, where the islanders helped to excavate the moai. It was hauled down from the lip of the Rano Kau crater, taken out to the ship on a raft, moored in the still waters off the island\u2019s main settlement, Hanga Roa, and gifted to Queen Victoria upon his return to England in August the following year. The Queen then donated it to the British Museum. Edmunds said that while all of the moai embody the spirits of prominent ancestors, Hoa Hakananai\u2019a holds particular spiritual importance. \u201cHe stood [at Orongo] to watch over and protect all of the tribes, and he helped forge friendships between them,\u201d he said. The different groups would meet at the site for festivities, ceremonies and competitions. Despite the significance of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, there is concern among some on the island for the other moai, which are slowly being eroded by the interminable barrage of the elements. Sonia Haoa, a renowned 65-year-old archaeologist who was born on Easter Island and has dedicated her career to recording and understanding how her ancestors lived, is conscious of the ambassadorial role Hoa Hakananai\u2019a plays \u2013 and fearful of what the future holds for the island. \u201cYou have to think about the context. A lot of people see [the moai] at the British Museum \u2013 it is the face of Rapa Nui abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cOur culture is all we have for an economy. We rely entirely on tourism, which is brought here by our history and archaeology \u2013 if we don\u2019t look after the moai then the oil well will dry up. We can\u2019t think about the present or political gain \u2013 if the moai turn to dust then there\u2019s nothing else here.\u201d Among the delegates travelling to the island is Lissant Bolton, the keeper of the Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas at the British Museum. The two parties will discuss preservation of the moai and the island\u2019s rich cultural history during a three-day visit, as well as the place of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a in its collection. \u201cThe [British Museum\u2019s] collections from Africa, Oceania and the Americas serve as a portal into aspects of history that are often not written down,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the only argument for keeping objects in museum collections, but it is certainly true that having a number of objects side-by-side enables you to triangulate histories and understand them in a different way.\u201d Independent of the indigenous community\u2019s attempts to bring the statue back to the island, Rapa Nui sculptor Benedicto Tuki has made an offer to Chile\u2019s Ministry of National Assets to carve an exact replica of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a to take the statue\u2019s place in the British Museum; while the island\u2019s mayor, Pedro Edmunds Paoa, told local media in December that he would favour a financial commitment on the part of the British Museum to help preserve the moai on the island. While efforts to coordinate the push for Hoa Hakananai\u2019a\u2019s return will crystallise during the delegation\u2019s visit, Carlos Edmunds said he feels gratitude towards the museum for taking such good care of his ancestor, adding: \u201cWe are being very respectful in our request for his return.\u201d He is confident of securing the return of two other moai from the Chilean mainland, kept in the coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and La Serena \u2013 but the return of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a from London remains his ultimate desire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
