Apparently after playing for Shandong Luneng Taishan in their defeat to Shanghai Shenhua in Friday\u2019s China Cup final second leg, the elbow-swinging midfielder \u201creceived a call that would have been a balm to his heart\u201d \u2013 from Mourinho himself. \u201cThe Portuguese coach would like to bring our compatriot back to the Premier League,\u201d they write, \u201cand has made the move a priority for his first transfer window at Tottenham, particularly given that there is nobody currently at the club with a similar profile \u2026 This is the beginning of what could be the great drama of this winter window.\u201d They go so far as to describe Fellaini as \u201cMourinho\u2019s special one\u201d, though whether Spurs fans will view the 31-year-old\u2019s potential arrival quite so tenderly remains to be seen. Fellaini\u2019s first English club, Everton, have drawn up a shortlist for their vacant managerial position that includes David Moyes, Mauricio Pochettino, Carlo Ancelotti and Eddie Howe (according to the Mail) as well as Leonardo Jardim, Marcelino and Ralf Rangnick (the Times) and the Ajax coach Erik ten Hag (the Mirror), but everyone agrees that the name at the top of it belongs to Vitor Pereira. His current employers, Shanghai SIPG, are apparently attempting to negotiate an extension to his contract as they try to head off interest from both Everton and Arsenal. Niko Kovac, the former Bayern Munich manager, was at Goodison Park on Saturday to watch Everton and plans to be at the London Stadium tonight to watch Arsenal. With Kwadwo Asamoah troubled by long-term knee problems and it being \u201cunimaginable to rely only on Cristiano Biraghi\u201d, Internazionale are looking for someone who \u201ccan bring great energy to the left flank\u201d \u2013 and they think the ideal man is Chelsea\u2019s Marcos Alonso, according to the Gazzetta dello Sport. Apparently he could be \u201cthe right man in the right place\u201d \u2013 the place in question being the extreme fringes of another team\u2019s squad. Of Chelsea\u2019s last six league games, Alonso spent one on the bench and the most recent five out of the squad altogether, and with Chelsea free to make signings next month, Antonio Conte is hopeful of reuniting with the Spanish full-back. The Nerazzurri play Barcelona on Tuesday, and Spanish papers Sport and Mundo Deportivo both expect the two clubs to use the opportunity to have a cosy chat about the futures of Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic, one of whom could move to Milan next month. Norwich have slapped a \u00a350m price tag on Ben Godfrey, who is being monitored by \u201ca number of Europe\u2019s top sides\u201d including Borussia Dortmund and Lyon, according to the Athletic. \u201cTottenham and Arsenal are also keeping an eye on his progress,\u201d they add, but Norwich believe Godfrey \u201chas many of the attributes required to become an elite defender, including exceptional speed and temperament\u201d, and thus will only let him leave if they are recompensed by a truly enormous quantity of cash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
