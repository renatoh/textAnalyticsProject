Corbyn \u2013 arriving in the Cambridgeshire city after the party\u2019s candidate Lisa Forbes won by 683 votes, leaving the Tories trailing in third position \u2013 called for the \u201csquabbling contenders\u201d within the Conservative party to give the public a general election. The Labour leader, flanked by Forbes and MP Louise Haigh, who masterminded the byelection victory, told Labour supporters in the city centre the party \u201cis not at the stage yet\u201d to push for a public vote. Asked about Labour splits over a people\u2019s vote, he said: \u201cObviously every party discusses its own position and its own strategy. I have said all along that we would put to parliament our proposals on a customs union on a trade relationship and the dynamic protection of consumer and workers\u2019 rights. \u201cAs our conference resolution agreed last September, we would then be prepared to put that to a public vote. We are not at the stage yet where parliament has actually voted on that. I think it would be much better if there was actually a general election.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s comments came as the internal Labour row about Brexit warmed up after the party\u2019s disastrous result at last month\u2019s European elections. There has also been unease from some Labour MPs and Jewish campaign groups about Forbes\u2019 election. The new MP had previously apologised for liking a Facebook post that said Theresa May had a \u201cZionist slave masters agenda\u201d, saying she had meant to \u201clike\u201d the video of children praying in solidarity with the victims of Christchurch attacks, not the accompanying views. The Times reported on Friday that the Labour MP Louise Ellman was calling for an investigation. She said: \u201cThese serious allegations must not be brushed under the carpet. Lisa Forbes should be suspended while the Labour party carries out an investigation.\u201d The paper said the Labour MP Margaret Hodge had also put in an official complaint about Forbes. The Jewish Labour Movement said Forbes needed to go \u201cfar further\u201d to demonstrate to the Jewish community that she was not racist. The Times reported that the group was calling for Forbes\u2019 suspension. The Labour backbencher Jess Phillips tweeted she could not be as \u201cgleeful or proud as I\u2019d want to be [after the byelection in Peterborough] because of how it shows that antisemitism is becoming normal in the party.\u201d Phillips added: \u201cLisa ignored and endorsed antisemitic things, I\u2019ll take her explanation and apology at face value and look forward to her proving, as others have, that actions not excuses alone can heal. But with every case the party\u2019s values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes.\u201d Haigh, who worked closely with Forbes, said the emergence of the postings was a low point for the campaign. She said: \u201cThe whole campaign team were really upset when the posts that Lisa had mistakenly engaged with came to light and that was definitely a very difficult point for the campaign. But Lisa fully accepts they were wrong. She is really, really sorry. \u201cI will be working with her to engage with the community and deepen her understanding and help her to be an ally in the future.\u201d On Brexit, grassroots activists are organising for constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to pass motions demanding a second referendum in the run-up to the party\u2019s autumn conference \u2013 the same process that laid the groundwork for the shift in policy last year. Mike Buckley, of the campaign group Labour for a Public Vote, said: \u201cHundreds of CLPs are already set to debate motions for conference calling for the party to back a new referendum, and to campaign for remain. We\u2019re confident of winning in September \u2013 but would much prefer the party to shift now. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll lose more voters over the summer and we won\u2019t be able to oppose no deal as effectively.\u201d The Labour MP Clive Lewis, of the pressure group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, tweeted in response to the Peterborough result: \u201cWe\u2019ve blunted our opponent\u2019s momentum with an overwhelming home field advantage. Now we must arm our activists with the radical policies they need to finish the job in the long slog ahead, including a public vote\u201d. Party insiders said tensions between Corbyn\u2019s office and those pushing for a more full-throated anti-Brexit stance were running high. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s usual stand-in for prime minister\u2019s questions this week after she spoke out about Labour\u2019s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was \u201cnot clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear\u201d. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist. Meanwhile, there is growing chatter about the possibility of the party\u2019s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Tom Watson, who has pursued a vocal campaign to toughen Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position. The proposal was mooted last year, but dropped at the last minute because of fears that a vote among party members could be used as a proxy referendum on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. A source close to Watson said: \u201cLashing out by expelling Alastair Campbell, publicly humiliating Emily Thornberry and challenging Tom for the deputy leadership is not the way to resolve this situation. \u201cNo matter how many punishment beatings are meted out, Tom will continue to speak out for what he believes in \u2013 a confirmatory ballot and a broad church Labour party that is avowedly pro-European.\u201d However, one close ally of Corbyn suggested the idea of challenging Watson may just have been \u201cloose talk\u201d in the aftermath of the European elections shock, which was then being \u201cactively briefed by Corbyn\u2019s opponents\u201d to \u201cadd to the sense of victimhood\u201d on the right of the party. In Peterborough, amid cheers from supporters, Corbyn called for Tory leadership contenders to give the general public a chance to vote them out of office. \u201cOn the day that Theresa May ceases to be leader of the Conservative party, my message is to all the squabbling contenders for the Tory party leadership: bring it on. We are ready for a general election at any time,\u201d he said. Forbes won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party\u2019s Mike Greene, who took 9,801 votes, a margin of 683. The Conservatives were beaten into third place with 7,243 votes. Turnout was 48%. Farage left the count through a back door minutes before the result was announced. But Greene said the Brexit party had made a significant breakthrough, despite not winning. \u201cWe have shaken up British politics with none of the data that is necessary to win a parliamentary election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two parties ruling for decades; that\u2019s not happening any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
