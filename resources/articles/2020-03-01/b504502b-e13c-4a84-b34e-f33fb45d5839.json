His form will leave others to speculate about the world No 1\u2019s prospects at the first major of the year, which is only a month away. A first round 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational planted McIlroy at the summit of the leaderboard before Matt Every\u2019s late surge saw him take a one-stroke advantage. Day one saw the kind of effortless, free-flowing golf which renders the Northern Irishman so appealing. The score was even more impressive given he was one over par after six holes. His 18-hole scoring average is the best on this PGA Tour season. His goal from here is simple: to capitalise on a terrific start, which was not the case in Mexico City a fortnight ago.Even that apparent slip requires context, given McIlroy was visibly well short of his best over the concluding three rounds of the World Golf Championship. \u201cI\u2019m definitely playing a bit better than I was in Mexico,\u201d said McIlroy in what should serve as a warning to the rest of the field. \u201cI\u2019m putting better, driving it better. I think the course suits me a little bit better as well. \u201cMexico was frustrating because I started well and then just couldn\u2019t get the best out of myself for the final three days. I\u2019m a little more comfortable on this course, comfortable with this style of play, and a little more comfortable on greens. \u201cI mean 54 holes is still a long way to go and you sort of take it one day at a time. It\u2019s not as if I played badly in Mexico. I shot 69, 68, 68 the last three days. I just didn\u2019t get as much out of myself as I wanted to.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s moment on Thursday arrived at the 4th, his 13th, where he sent a glorious three iron from a fairway bunker to within 25ft of the pin. He converted for an eagle. \u201cHarry [Diamond, McIlroy\u2019s caddie] said that\u2019s the best shot I\u2019ve hit all year,\u201d he said. \u201cHigh praise from him. I had 260 yards, it was in between three iron and five wood. Five wood was going to carry up on top but it had a chance to go over the back of the green and that chip from over the back to that back pin is really tricky. \u201cSo I said to Harry: \u2018If I can catch this three iron I can maybe pitch it 10 or 15 yards short.\u2019 Short was always better than long. And it just came out perfectly and got up to pin high.\u201d Justin Rose, playing in McIlroy\u2019s company, was two under par at one stage but had to settle for a 73. Intrigue surrounds Rose\u2019s equipment; he signed a club deal with Honma from the start of 2019 and, while that brand still appears on his bag, he has suddenly reverted to TaylorMade irons and driver. Brooks Koepka\u2019s assessment of his 72 was typically blunt. \u201cEven par, nothing to get excited about, nothing to rave about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off but it\u2019s still annoying.\u201d Matt Wallace enjoyed a welcome return to form with a 69. Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s impressive start to the year continued as he signed for one shot better than his fellow Englishman. \u201cI just putted really well,\u201d Hatton said. \u201cI actually feel like I struggled a bit with shots into the green but just putted nicely and that was a big part of the score.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
