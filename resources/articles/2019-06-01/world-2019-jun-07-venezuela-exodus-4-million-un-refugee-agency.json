The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees stood at about 695,000 at the end of 2015, the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) announced on Friday. Three and a half years later \u2013 with Venezuela immersed in a seemingly intractable social and political crisis \u2013 that number has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d to more than 4 million, the groups said. About half of that total have sought shelter in two South American countries \u2013 Colombia and Peru \u2013 which host about 1.3 million and 768,000 respectively. Many others have made for Chile (288,000), Ecuador (263,000), Brazil (168,000) and Argentina (130,000). The humanitarian groups said \u201csignificant\u201d numbers were also heading to the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico. Venezuelan activists and officials in Mexico estimate the exile community there has grown to about 40,000 in recent years. A growing number are also heading to the United States, with nearly 30,000 Venezuelans applying for asylum there last year, according to the Los Angeles Times. That meant Venezuela had overtaken China to become the number one country of origin for those claiming asylum on arrival or shortly after, the newspaper said. Eduardo Stein, the special representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants for UNHCR and the IOM, said the \u201calarming\u201d rise in their numbers underlined an urgent need to support those countries grappling with Venezuela\u2019s historic exodus. \u201cLatin American and Caribbean countries are doing their part to respond to this unprecedented crisis but they cannot be expected to continue doing it without international help,\u201d Stein said. Authorities in Brazil and Colombia have set up shelters near their borders with Venezuela to house refugees as they arrive, often famished and on foot. But there have also been reports of tensions and even violence between locals and Venezuelan newcomers, as regional governments struggle to cope with one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history. Some governments have begun introducing tougher entry requirements for Venezuelans in an effort to slow the increase. This week Peru\u2019s president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, said that as of 15 June Venezuelan migrants \u2013 many of whom lack passports \u2013 would need to obtain humanitarian visas from Peruvian consulates in Venezuela before coming. The announcement came after Peru\u2019s interior minister, Carlos Mor\u00e1n, blamed Venezuelans for an increase in crime. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be xenophobic [but] the presence of Venezuelan citizens \u2026 has caused these [crime] rates to shoot up,\u201d Mor\u00e1n said. Since January Venezuela\u2019s US-backed opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has been battling to topple President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the chavistas he blames for the country\u2019s collapse. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tornado. It wasn\u2019t a hurricane. It wasn\u2019t an earthquake. It wasn\u2019t a fire that spread uncontrollably. No \u2013 it was caused by the corruption of this regime,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said in a recent interview with the Guardian. But Maduro has yet to budge, insisting he is capable of overseeing Venezuela\u2019s economic recovery. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s outspoken hostility towards Maduro, his administration has resisted calls to grant Venezuelan migrants protection under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme, which allows people from countries suffering conflict or natural disaster to remain in the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
