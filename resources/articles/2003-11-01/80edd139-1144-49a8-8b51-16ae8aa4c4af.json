Margaret Hodge, the controversial former head of Islington council who was promoted to children's minister in June, wrote to BBC chairman Gavyn Davies to condemn an investigation by Today reporter Angus Stickler into alleged child abuse in the London borough. In her letter she described a child abuse victim who spoke to Stickler as an \"extremely disturbed person\" and accused Today of being \"unfair\" in its handling of the story. Stickler began investigating Islington council's failure to tackle accusations of child abuse in its children's homes after a victim, Demetrious Panton, came forward to tell of his experiences. Mr Panton said the council had ignored repeated claims that he had been abused as a child by Bernie Bain, who was the head of his children's home in 1978. Bain has since committed suicide. Ms Hodge, whose appointment as children's minister earlier this year was heavily criticised amid claims she did not do enough to tackle the problem of abuse in Islington children's homes, wrote to the BBC chairman in September after learning of Stickler's investigations. She accused Today - still reeling from the public row over its report on government scientist David Kelly's claims about the government's Iraq weapons dossier - of displaying \"scant balance\" in previous broadcasts. Ms Hodge asked Mr Davies to investigate her concerns and referred to high court proceedings issued in 1996 against Channel 4 News over an item about child abuse. Channel 4 apologised for its story. The minister maintains she was never told of Mr Panton's complaints - a claim Today does not dispute. But Stickler today said her letter to the BBC chairman contained \"a thinly veiled threat of legal action\" and \"more seriously, an unprecedented attack by this country's children's minister against a former victim of child abuse\". \"Margaret Hodge describes our investigation as 'deplorable sensationalism'. We, however, believe it to be a matter of public interest. Whether she was personally informed about this case is beside the point,\" he said. Ms Hodge declined to be interviewed by the programme but issued a statement saying: \"Since becoming children's minister in June, Angus Stickler and the Today programme have been constantly telephoning [my] friends and colleagues to drag up details of events that happened 10 years ago. \"I felt this was a concerted campaign against me which is why I wrote a letter I did not publish in September. \"I am taken aback that the Today programme has chosen to make a letter that was not for publication public. I have decided not to appear on the Today programme today because there is nothing new to say.\" There is no evidence to support Ms Hodge's claim that Mr Panton is \"disturbed\" said Detective Superintendent John Sweeney, who investigated Mr Panton's original allegations. He told Today: \"I found Demetrious to be very articulate... He had a very measured response to what had happened. I have no doubt that if it had got to court we would have had a very strong case. \"I wouldn't say he was disturbed at all. He certainly wanted justice and he wanted to see Mr Bain in the dock in a British court. That's perfectly understandable.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
