The food manufacturer - which owns the Goodfellas, Dalepak, Fox's and Pork Farms food brands - yesterday announced plans to shut Cavaghan &amp; Gray, a quiche-making factory in Carlisle which employs 660. Evesham Foods, in Worcestershire, which turns out sausage rolls, is also listed to close, with the loss of about 400 jobs. Northern Foods said it was taking \"robust action\" to cut costs and boost productivity and had already eliminated 30 senior management positions to simplify its structure, shorten reporting lines and cut out duplication. Its workforce totals 22,000. The group, which announced the cuts with a pre-close trading update, said it had been prompted by tough competition and the need for greater efficiency. The losses will cost \u00a345m and save \u00a310m a year. Food producers are under pressure from supermarket groups to hold down their prices, while raw material and energy prices are rising. Northern said \"overall input cost inflation is running slightly above 2%, compared with our selling price increases averaging just below 2%\". The Usdaw trade union described the shutdowns as \"unexpected and devastating for workers\". John Hannett, Usdaw general secretary, said: \"This announcement has left the workforce stunned. At this stage we want to put some flesh on the bones of this announcement ... to find out exactly why this decision has been taken.\" The company said the closures were \"intended to enhance plant utilisation and productivity\" and that it would create 200 new jobs elsewhere. \"Consultation with unions is ongoing.\" The cuts and closures come five months after Patricia O'Driscoll joined the company as chief executive. The company's problems are concentrated in its chilled food business - which produces recipe dishes for Sainsbury's Taste the Difference, Tesco's Finest and Marks &amp; Spencer's Count on Us ranges. \"Improving this is our highest priority,\" the group said. Christmas trading, it added, would be \"critical\" to full year results. The City liked the cutbacks and the shares added 5.5p to close at 150p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
