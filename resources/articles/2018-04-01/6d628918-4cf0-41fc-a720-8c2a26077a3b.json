Headteachers from schools in deprived areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland say they are having to provide basic services such as washing school uniforms for pupils from poor households, and are even paying for budget advice and counselling services for parents. Teachers and school leaders also said they were regularly providing sanitary products such as tampons for pupils, buying shoes and coats in winter, and in some cases giving emergency loans in cash to families. The experiences of the school leaders are borne out by the findings of a survey published on Monday by the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Education Union (NEU), which is holding its annual conference in Brighton over Easter. In the survey of 900 teachers, 60% said child poverty in schools had worsened since 2015, and one in three said it had got significantly worse. \u201cPoverty on paper seems to be getting better, our number of free school meals seems to be going down, but the reality is completely the reverse \u2013 poverty is just becoming more and more extreme. Benefit entitlement rules are shutting more and more families out of the system,\u201d said Jane Jenkins, the headteacher of an inner-city primary school in Cardiff. \u201cIt is really tough. When people are asking you about standards and why a school is not higher in the league tables, often that is very much a secondary consideration for us these days. More and more, for third-sector \u200eservices and children\u2019s services, the pressures that those services are under are absolutely massive. So school is now the only agency where children and parents are getting that sort of support.\u201d Howard Payne, the headteacher of a primary school in Portsmouth, said: \u201cOver the last 18 months the number of child protection issues I have seen has increased fourfold \u2013 and I\u2019m in a small school. Every single one of those issues has been related to poverty, debt, not eating enough, and that has increased dramatically.\u201d During the snowstorms this winter, Payne said, he kept his school open when other schools in the area were closed. \u201cI kept ours open because I was really worried about the number of children who wouldn\u2019t get a hot meal that day,\u201d Payne said. Several school leaders said they had noticed a visible difference in health and stature between children from their schools in deprived areas and those from better-off areas. One headteacher from a school in Cumbria, who did not want to be named, said she was shocked to witness the differences between former pupils from her school and those from other primaries. \u201cMy children, who have gone from me up to the local secondary school, have grey skin, poor teeth, poor hair, poor nails. They are smaller, they are thinner,\u201d she said. \u201cAt sporting events, you see your children in the year group compared to other children in an affluent area and you think: our kids are really small. You don\u2019t notice it because you\u2019re with them all the time, but when you see them with children of the same age who are from an affluent area, they just look tiny.\u201d Other school leaders reported having to clean pupils\u2019 school uniforms, especially after weekends when some children from poor households had no way of washing their clothes. \u201cWe are expected to be social workers, to be carers, doctors, we are expected to deal with every issue at the same time as doing all the other things that government wants us to do,\u201d said Louise Regan, the head of a primary school in Nottinghamshire. \u201cWe have a food bank, so we give out food parcels, particularly on Fridays, we buy clothing, we do a lot of buying, particularly coats in winter and shoes,\u201d Regan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had children who haven\u2019t come to school because they didn\u2019t have shoes. We\u2019ve gone and bought shoes, taken them to their house and brought the child into school.\u201d The headteachers, all delegates attending the NEU\u2019s conference, said Mondays were often the worst days, with children arriving in school hungry and tired after a weekend with little food. Celia Dignam, an NEU official responsible for child poverty, said the union\u2019s survey revealed the reality of 4.1 million children living in poverty. \u201cSchools, as well as educating children, are now a safety net, particularly for children in poverty,\u201d Dignam said, noting that the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that 5 million children would be living in poverty by 2021. \u201cThis is not a situation that is getting better, it\u2019s actually getting significantly worse,\u201d she said. The survey found that 55% of teachers felt free school meal provision did not come close to meeting the needs of pupils from poor backgrounds. \u201cFrom 2022 there\u2019s going to be an income threshold for universal credit, so there are children currently entitled to free school meals who will not be getting them,\u201d said Dignam. \u201cWe\u2019re heading for an absolute crisis. You think we\u2019ve got a crisis now but it\u2019s going to get even worse unless we see some policy change from government.\u201d The NEU argues that all children whose families are receiving universal credit should become eligible for free school meals. Although child poverty sits outside of the Department for Education\u2019s remit, the DfE has allowed pupil premium funding to be used for poverty alleviation. \u201cWe continue to support the most disadvantaged children [in England] through free school meals, the \u00a32.5bn funding given to schools through the pupil premium to support their education and the recently announced \u00a326m investment to kickstart or improve breakfast clubs in at least 1,700 schools,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said. Last week the education minister Nadhim Zahawi announced funding for research into ways of supporting disadvantaged families during the school holidays, to overcome \u201choliday hunger\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
