Allardyce may have displayed an unseemly enthusiasm for the financial blandishments of the people purporting to be a football agency firm but greed was not the crucial factor here. A curious reaction to Allardyce\u2019s sacking has been apparent since the Daily Telegraph \u201cstung\u201d him. Those who daily dispense street wisdom on these sorts of things all shook their heads ruefully and shouted \u201cgreed\u201d in a way that made you think they had never been guilty of this, the most commonly practised of the seven deadly sins. Many of them follow clubs that have spent inordinate amounts on unremarkable footballers whose stated goal in life is to make as much money as possible out of the short and brutally unforgiving stretch of their playing careers. Yet it would be wrong also to accuse these mendicant, latterday Merlins of being avaricious in their dealings with the game that has made them rich. Football is still largely a game supported by working-class men and women and it is still largely from these communities that the overwhelming majority of professional footballers will emerge. The young men who have been blessed with the ability to play this game with an extraordinarily high level of skill quickly realise that they have been given one of life\u2019s golden tickets. Within a short period of being discovered, they will understand that an assortment of sharp-suited Fagins and corporate money-changers has hitched their wagons to \u201cthe People\u2019s Game\u201d for the singular purpose of making money from it. From time to time, global sponsors will appoint brand ambassadors and chirrup some nonsense about supporting football in the community but whatever scraps they throw to the urchins are swamped by the eye-watering profits they extract from their association with the game. They will hear dressing-room tales, handed down through each succeeding generation of footballers, of how good, honest professionals were preyed upon and then cheated out of their money by businessmen who stuck in at school while their victims were getting stuck in at endless youth coaching sessions. Most of them will also know that football clubs seem beholden to nothing that resembles employment law and have all the social responsibility of Victorian mill-owners. Footballers exist to be trained to the point of exhaustion; to be exploited for the few brief years when they shine and thence to be discarded as abruptly as a lame horse. I can\u2019t think of any workers more entitled to grab as much as they can while they are still considered sufficiently fit to do so. Managers are footballers who either survived the system or had the fortitude to recognise early in their careers that, though they might not be good enough to make life-changing quantums of money, they could make a decent living beyond their playing days in coaching. They too know that their job security is on a parallel with that of a diversity consultant in Texas. They will never be more than a few months away from being sacked by the puce-faced scion of the local butcher\u2019s firm. So, let\u2019s not get all puritanical and censorious about what might have motivated Big Sam to maximise his earnings during what would inevitably have been a short and chaotic stewardship of the world\u2019s favourite underperforming national football team. Yet Allardyce had to go. By expressing his contempt for FA rules on third-party ownership, he was breaking perhaps the last innocent contract that exists between football supporters and the game that we love. The loyalty of fans to their chosen club eclipses almost all other fealties in the course of our lives. As such, we are eternally vulnerable to the predations of big business and the chisellers who follow in their wake. Our lot as fans is to be festooned with overpriced merchandise, swollen ticket prices and huckster airlines that hike air fares whenever a British team is drawn to play in Europe. The supporters, though, accept all this and understand that it will always be a part of the game. We all choose to look the other way in exchange for two things: that the players give everything of themselves on the pitch and that they all belong wholly to the club that purchased them on our behalf and with our money. We have a not unreasonable expectation that wee Alfredo Sivori is not also part-owned by a dodgy consortium concerned in the supply of rocket-launchers to the Assad regime. At Celtic Park last Wednesday night, I watched something extraordinary unfold that was more important than seeing my team go toe to toe with the most expensively assembled squad in the history of British football and emerge unbowed. I observed a communion between supporters and team that helped their exhausted players reach the finishing line and stumble over it. And I saw Manchester City players forget about the millions in their bank accounts, roll up their sleeves in the driving Glasgow rain and respond by playing with the passion and desire of their childhoods. The supporters were rewarded with a game that did not feature any bookings and in which the players of each side did not try to con the referee or induce him to dismiss opponents by feigning injury. Later that same evening, I was invited to discuss the Sam Allardyce affair on STV with Nick Hilton, the Spectator writer. Hilton, at one point, seemed to be suggesting that football fans are largely ignorant of the sophisticated financial arrangements that govern Big Football. He was wrong, for we know full well that wherever money chooses to reside corruption and larceny will follow it. But every once in a while, an encounter like Celtic v Manchester City comes along and we remember again why we love this game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
