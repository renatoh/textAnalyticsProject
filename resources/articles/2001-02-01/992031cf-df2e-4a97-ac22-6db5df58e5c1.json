In the late afternoon, Brian and I hopped on ferry to Taronga Zoo. Ignoring the dubious delights of the zoo itself we instead headed along a coastal path to Bradley's Head. The walk was beautiful, with some of the few remaining bits of natural bushland in Sydney. I was delighted to be back among red gum trees and parrots, though out encounter with several large hairy spiders wasn't so enjoyable. It seemed strange to me how no-one else was walking through this natural zoo, with its fantastic views over the harbour where the bridge and opera house were clearly visible through the grey haze. If you're headed that way, take an extra hour to explore this scenic area. On Friday I finally got round to getting a medicard - which my flatmates had been nagging me to do for a while. It means you can see a doctor for free and they say it's one of the first things a traveller should do on arriving in Australia. My attempts to go to the beach in the afternoon were thwarted by heavy rain - and not for the first time in these last few weeks - grrrrrrr. In the evening my apartment group headed to a local place to listen to some live music. I was stunned by how quiet the venue was and we realised that at last the summer holidays were over - and Sydney was populated only by people who actually lived there. We went to watch a huge inter-suburb water competition at my local beach involving rowing, canoeing, and beach relay on Saturday. Although Coogee didn't do particularly well, it was impressive how few of the entrants capsized looking at the size of some of those waves. Later that afternoon I tried out a funk class at a nearby performing arts centre. It was a lot of fun, as we were a large group of beginners basically all out for some exercise combined with enjoyment - and I definitely enjoyed the feeling of freedom that you get with dancing. That evening myself and Brian went to the fantastically tacky Miss Coogee Bay - a competition in the style of Miss World. The main point seemed to be to have girls in their swimsuits for as long as possible while avoiding hearing them talk. When asked what she'd do with one wish, a contestant actually replied \"cure all world poverty and hunger'. Through modelling perhaps?! Still it made for an entertaining evening, as long as it wasn't taken seriously. Later that night, I was using the phone box which is literally just outside my apartment. I became aware that a guy had perched extremely close by so I turned to see why. It was then I noticed that he had started doing something that, let's just say, is not normal or decent for a guy to do in public, with the deliberate intention that I'd see. I cut short my call and ran back, with him calling lewd things. At least I was close to home. My advice to lone female travellers is be careful. There's no reason why girls shouldn't travel alone - in fact, I'd recommend it, but be aware that there are a few odd people around so don't put yourself in situations where you would be vulnerable. Just keep a bit of common sense and awareness. The next day I headed to Darling Harbour to watch a succession of Dragon Boat races in the morning, then went to the calm of the Botanical Gardens for a peaceful afternoon by myself and a good read. Besides, tomorrow I had to work - Monday mornings have taken back their old meaning for me! My second day at the hotel was no less stressful than the first. The same group of us were given yet another tour - and the hotel is such a maze we needed it - before an afternoon of very simple work. Basically we had to set things up, take things down . . and eat a lot. None of which seemed particularly taxing especially as it's such a nice group that I'm with. Afterwards we all headed to the pub, and it was good to meet a whole new group of travellers and share each other's experiences so far. Everybody has different situations - there was one couple who were struggling just to buy dinner every night, and there was French guy who told me about some of the ridiculous arguments he'd had with his girlfriend. All travelling couples I've met seem to argue, maybe due to the intensity of it - his argument had centred around whether or not he was going to eat some of her cookie! On Tuesday, Michaela moved out of my room and Brian moved in. Ever since I moved in Michaela has been getting increasingly excited and nervous about the arrival of her girlfriend on Wednesday who she's not seen for six months. I've got a lot of sympathy for that and hope everything goes well for them. In the afternoon I headed to Newtown, an area I'd not been through before. It was an interesting and funky suburb with individual shops called things like Chocolate Dog caf\u00e9 and Blue Turtle studios. Even the residents looked interesting. In the evening I rejoined the group from the hostel to enter a quiz at a local pub which, despite our best intentions to lose, we came in third. It didn't help that we argued over every question. On Wednesday, despite having had no intentions to go there, I found myself at Star City Casino in the early afternoon. I couldn't believe how packed the place was at such an obscure time of day - I was reliably informed however that 4am is their busiest time. Deciding I had to play something now I was there, I tried to change 20c for a bizarre card computer game. The cashier informed me, and I'm sure she was trying not to laugh, that the smallest amount you can bet is $1. I was feeling reckless so I thought I'd try the whole dollar - and was rewarded by a further dollar win. I thought I'd better end my gambling career there and then as I'd found the game unsettlingly addictive. Later that evening me and Brian returned to the casino area for my long-promised stab at karaoke. It's something I've never been brave enough to try before but I thought nobody will know me the other side of the world! The upshot was, I got roped into singing the Kylie and Jason classic Especially for you with a Scottish guy. I thought we were superb - we didn't just sing, we put our heart and soul into that performance. Everybody told us we were terrible (just jealousy I'm sure), but it gave me the confidence to get up on my own - after which I achieved the dizzying heights of a \"fairly poor\" performance! Still, it was a brilliantly enjoyable evening with the only downside that I returned to Coogee at 2.30 - and I start work four hours later at 6.30am! Something tells me this isn't going to be such an easy day's work - I just hope I can stay awake through it. . . Until next week (when I'll be enjoying some lovely early morning shifts) Milly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
