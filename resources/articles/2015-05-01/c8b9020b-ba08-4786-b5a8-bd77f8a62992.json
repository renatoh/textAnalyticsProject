The shadow education secretary will also warn that a party that merely tries to restore \u201cthe beating heart of Labour\u201d \u2013 a phrase adopted by leadership hopeful Andy Burnham \u2013 would remain out of office and so, once again, would let down its heartland communities. Hunt\u2019s speech on Wednesday is likely to be critical in his efforts to get on to the leadership ballot paper, and is designed to show he has a distinctive overall analysis of both Labour\u2019s failures and the potential solution. Urging the party not to lapse into an abstract discussion about values, Hunt tries to come up with practical examples of how Labour can adopt what he calls a 100% strategy that appeals to the whole of the country, and not simply micro-targeted groups. Hunt, part of the 2010 intake and considered one of the party\u2019s intellectuals, is still struggling to gather nominations from 35 MPs \u2013 a requirement for any candidate who wishes to put their name forward for the summer leadership election. He will say in a speech to the thinktank Demos in London that Miliband was right to make the issue of inequality central to to his programme, but the radicalism in the former Labour leader\u2019s thinking was often blunted by a timid desire to square vested interests in the party. Hunt will set out three big ideas he says Miliband felt unable to embrace: \u2022 The restoration of the principle of contribution to the benefits system, with higher rates paid to those claimants with a strong record of employment \u2022 The introduction of a universal right to free childcare for working parents of children aged two or over by freezing or reducing child benefit \u2022 The extension of the principle of \u201cdevo max\u201d to the English cities and regions, with combined authorities given the power to vary rates of tax so they can attract investment to particular areas as well as have control over the growth of business rate income they receive. Hunt argues: \u201cWe did not lack for ideas, what we lacked was political courage. In our strategic straitjacket, we refused to accept them, to make the argument for them or to build them into a new sense of mission.\u201d He will say Labour has to be seen to be on the people\u2019s side and earn the right to be trusted with their future. He will argue that trust \u201conly comes when we offer a broad-based, forward-looking Labour project. A 100% strategy. Not the timid, institutionalised caution which led so many to believe we had a 35% strategy\u201d. On families, Hunt will say: \u201cThere are historical deficiencies of our approach towards the family and the belief that child poverty can be solved largely or even entirely through material redistribution. \u201cWe need institutions that tackle inequality at source \u2013 by raising the opportunities parents have to work and children have to learn, not provide a monetary sticking plaster when it is far too late. \u201cWe need to offer a childcare revolution, free all year round, for every working family. Such ambition does not come cheap. \u201cThe IPPR [Institute for Public Policy Research] suggested it would mean hard choices like freezing child benefit for school-age children.\u201d On welfare reform, he will say: \u201cGo back to [social reformer William] Beveridge, begin to restore the contributory principle: you pay more in, you get more out. \u201cThe IPPR\u2019s Condition of Britain report proposed big reforms to restore the principle of contribution most of which ended up on the cutting room floor. \u201cWe should establish a clear principle with out-of work benefits. If you have a strong record of work, you should receive more help when you fall on hard times.\u201d He will also express his dismay about the way Labour allowed the devolution agenda to be stolen from Labour by George Osborne, the chancellor. Hunt will say: \u201cLabour needs to win the race to hand power back to local people. Yet even more important: radical devolution must surely form a big part of our answer to the rise of nationalism \u2013 both in Scotland and in England. \u201cA modernising approach to devolution must be about about growing local pride and local prosperity. \u201cThis is about more than the powers of local government \u2013 and indeed the Labour party\u2019s approach to community \u2013 it is about the integrity of the United Kingdom itself. \u201cWe must shed our timidity, match the Tory offer and go beyond it by giving city and country regions the power to vary local taxes, including business rates. \u201cDevo max shouldn\u2019t stop at the Scottish border. If it\u2019s good for Scotland and Scottish business, it\u2019s good for England too. We need a devo max settlement for England.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
