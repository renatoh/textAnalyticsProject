As I enter the room, he leaps to his feet and strides seamlessly into a handshake, with a smile that dissolves into a disarming expression of mea culpa. \"Forgive me,\" he apologises, with a hint of naughty-boy bashfulness. \"Have we met before?\" We haven't, but how could he be expected to know? The man has been shaking hands all over the world for 50 years. Back in the early 90s, when Meyer served as John Major's press secretary, a lot of the hands belonged to political journalists \u2013 and as Britain's ambassador to the US, he entertained 35,000 visitors in his home every year. After six years in Washington, in 2003, he returned to London, and within weeks was running the Press Complaints Commission, dealing with journalists every day. Now the gamekeeper has turned poacher, and become a broadcast journalist. You can take the boy out of the Foreign Office, but he is the most hilariously gracious, fragrantly well-mannered hack I have ever met. Tall, angular and immaculately groomed, the 68-year-old former public schoolboy looks like a Hollywood casting director's fantasy of an English gentleman, and in another life could have made a living playing extras in James Bond films. Instead, we are about to see him present Networks of Power, a six-part documentary that follows his journey through New York, Los Angeles, London, Mumbai, Rome and Moscow, working out who wields power in each city and trying to penetrate the inner sanctums of influence. Onscreen, he is Paxmanesque \u2013 quizzical, authoritative, faintly mischievous \u2013 but his fascination with power is not just palpable but insatiable, almost pornographic. Virtually every time he says the word \"power\" to me, Meyer thrusts his hips and draws back one arm, elbow bent and fist clenched, with a forceful tug familiar to anyone who has ever seen a Chippendale dance routine. It is impossible to imagine any politician daring to betray such naked excitement, and I now look at civil servants in a new light \u2013 but his thrill makes the series immensely watchable. In essence, we see what he has been doing all his life \u2013 \"Finding the people who had some influence, who had some juice\" \u2013 and persuading them to talk. \"I thought, this is really interesting \u2013 what makes these cities tick? Who makes them tick? And I started off with a hypothesis, which I think has been more or less justified by the filming, which was: perhaps they have more in common with each other than they do with their own countries,\" he says. Having watched Mumbai, Moscow and Rome, I would say the common trait is an alarming degree of nepotism. \"You hit on an essential truth,\" Meyer agrees, \"although it manifests itself in different ways in different cities. But if you reduced it to its most crude basics, you would say, 'It's not what you know, it's who you know that matters.'\" The discovery doesn't seem to dismay him in the slightest. \"It's probably the human condition,\" he shrugs. \"It's not so much nepotism as it is that it is your nature to surround yourself with people who you think will advance your interests, with whom you have some essential compatibility and with whom you get on. And therefore to rail against it, as we do \u2013 well \u2026\" He leaves the sentence unfinished, the futility of protest so self-evident as to speak for itself. It is a fact of life that Meyer himself has observed faithfully. When his Washington posting ended, he didn't stick around in the US. \"There's nothing more pitiful than ex-ambassadors crawling around. They look like lame dogs. In Washington there were a few European ex-ambassadors, and they were the most pitiful sight on God's earth, because once your essential juice leaves you \u2013 an ambassador's juice is that he's an ambassador \u2013 and you hang around hoping someone's going to give you a consultancy job in DC or New York City \u2013 well, there's nothing more pitiful, because Americans know where power is. \"If you were a very charming personality, or could play very good tennis, you might still get a few invitations. But you wouldn't get the key invitations. You wouldn't get access to the White House.\" It is hard not to smile at the idea of regarding life in any city as out of the question unless one's name features on the head of state's guest list. But it's also hard to imagine Meyer's social calendar drying up \u2013 for he is certainly a charming personality, winningly self-deprecating (\"My idea of an interesting conversation is when somebody sort of agrees with me\"), and adept at camouflaging vanity with wit (\"What are you doing?\" he teases the hair and makeup lady, as if she'd not been booked by him, but had wandered in off the street. \"Are you backcombing me so I look like a 60s pop star? It's a beehive! I look like somebody from Top of the Pops in the mid-70s!\"). When the editor of the Guardian's name comes up, Meyer jokes: \"I think he is the most wonderful human being who ever bestrode the earth. He is a colossus of the British press, without which the nation's life would be poorer.\" He uses my name more than anyone I have ever interviewed, and gives every impression of being a world-class gossip. The impression was confirmed when he published his memoir in 2006. A sensationally indiscreet account of his time in Washington, DC Confidential scandalised the political classes by breaking the unwritten rule that mandarins take their secrets to the grave. Meyer was defiantly unapologetic \u2013 if ministers and leaders are allowed to write their memoirs, why shouldn't he? \u2013 but when I ask if he ever worried that the book might damage his professional capital, his \"No\" is a fraction too fast and forceful. \"No, the memoir turned out to be a great recapitaliser.\" He hadn't expected it to do that either, though, he adds, and was quite unprepared for the furore. \"A number of people came out of the woodwork, crawled out from under stones, all leprous and scaly.\" His delivery is cleverly pitched, not emphasising the words so much as elongating them \u2013 \"craaaawwwled\", \"leppppp-rous\", \"scayyyyy-ly\" \u2013 making what could have sounded self-pitying come across as teasingly witty. \"Including some who'd never read the book!\" he can't resist adding. If he had drawn up a list of likely enemies in advance, how accurate would it have been? \"Pretty inaccurate.\" That must have been confronting. \"Hmm. It was challenging, Decca. I believe that's the fashionable word. It came as a bit of a surprise. But it was helpful, because then I knew who to avoid in the future.\" He had been a diplomat for almost 40 years when he left Washington. \"And I'd had enough. I'd had enough.\" Of having to be nice to everyone? \"I wasn't nice to everybody! That's the whole point! Being diplomatic doesn't mean being soft-soap. There's a time for soft-soap, and a time for Brillo-pad diplomacy. You've just got to choose your moment. It's part of the art of diplomacy.\" I'd always thought diplomacy meant sucking up to everyone, I tell him. \"I blame the press,\" he sighs, affecting ironic despair. In fact, Meyer famously blames the press for almost nothing. He thinks \"99% of British journalism is damned good\", and at the Leveson inquiry earlier this year defended the PCC's record with gladiatorial ferocity, giving Robert Jay QC a rare run for his money. \"I liked Robert Jay,\" he reflects. \"He had a naughty twinkle in his eye.\" As did Meyer, I point out. \"Well, I quite enjoyed it,\" he admits. \"But don't set me off on this \u2013 I'm going to be ranting. This is about the television series, this is not about Leveson.\" I suspect it wouldn't take much to set him off, despite his self-imposed injunction to steer clear of the subject. Instead, I ask him which cities will be leading the world 25 years from now. Will Mumbai outgun Beijing? \"Ah, that is the 64,000 renminbi question. You would hope the world's largest democracy would be able to do that, but I don't know, Decca, I really don't know. My crystal ball is black on that one.\" He is optimistic about London's future, though, and cites a conversation with Evgeny Lebedev, the son of the Russian oligarch owner of the Independent newspaper. \"He said to me, 'London is what Brits say about New York City; vibrant, multicultural, cutting edge, anyone can succeed \u2013 you can be whoever you want, traditions don't hem you in, it's classless.'\" New York, Lebedev told him, is an infinitely more conservative city than London. Meyer thinks both will still be leading world cities in 25 years' time, but is more doubtful about LA. \"I thought the future of LA was a complete mystery.\" Its power derives largely from Hollywood, and Meyer admits to having always been sceptical about soft power. \"People have given me so many examples of soft power which I always thought, 'What a load of balls', you know?'\" But in Mumbai he met the king of Bollywood, Indian filmstar Shah Rukh Khan, \"who taught me the lesson that there really is a thing called soft power, and it is influential\". A Muslim married to a Hindu, Khan is the poster boy for a version of Islam that accommodates artistic creativity and religious tolerance, and in Meyer's view challenges Islamic fundamentalism more effectively than any amount of western military might. \"Clearly, the values he adopts, the things he says, the movies he makes, the family life that he has, are monstrously influential. And that is soft power.\" Meyer was much less impressed by Rome. He once lived in Italy, \"And going back was very disappointing. I had rather romantic memories of it, but I thought it was a city which really showed its economic distress. If you're walking around the centre of Rome in the evenings, there just aren't many people about.\" In the film we see him get annoyed by a taxi drivers' strike, and look uncharacteristically uneasy at a trade union rally. \"So Italian,\" he says witheringly. \"'To death! Unity unto death!' From a bloke in a really smart suit, probably going off to lunch afterwards at a rather good restaurant.\" None of the billionaires Meyer meets seems to annoy him, though, and their saccharine mantras about \"giving something back\" in the form of status-enhancing philanthropy pass unchallenged. Even more striking is the inordinate number of beautiful women he finds to interview in every city. \"This was a producer's decision \u2013 I was a mere marionette in this, I was simply ventriloquised,\" he protests playfully. But on film he comes across as a bit of a randy old goat, even cat-calling to women from his taxi in Rome: \"Hello girls!\" He says Catherine, his second wife, found that scene \"quite funny\", and their marriage has a reputation for glamorous ardour; they wed just days before his dispatch to Washington, where, by all accounts, she was a terrific hit. But he admits to being bowled over by the number of beauties he encountered in Moscow this time round, in stark contrast to his posting during the Soviet era in the 60s. \"I just remember dumpy ladies building roads. And suddenly these incredible beauties turned up! I thought, where do all these 6ft tall Russian women come from, for God's sake?\" Back in the 60s nearly all the Russian women he encountered were KGB honeytraps \u2013 once the security forces had worked out he wasn't gay. \"One of my duties was to organise the Christmas panto cabaret. Because in the dark days of the cold war you needed that sort of thing to keep embassy morale up.\" KGB bugs in his apartment picked up rehearsals for a dance sequence to Tchaikovsky's Sugar Plum Fairy \u2013 \"I'd got the biggest, ugliest men in the embassy, and they were whooping and camping it up\" \u2013 and the next thing Meyer knew, the woman who taught him Russian turned up with a book full of photos of male Russian ballet dancers in tights. \"She started turning the pages, saying, 'What do you think of him?'\" Realising their mistake, the KGB then besieged Meyer with one seductress after another, whose lack of subtlety will come as a blow to anyone who, like me, ever credited the Soviets with a modicum of cunning. Meyer recalls one evening in a hotel in a far-flung city, when two women sheathed in dresses made of silver lam\u00e9 and rubber joined his table, uninvited, and announced abruptly: \"'We have a flat very near the airport, which will be very convenient for your flight tomorrow morning back to Moscow.' We chatted them up for a bit, then we fled to our room and locked the door. And the phone rang in our room all through the night. It never stopped.\" He tells the anecdote with nostalgia, but I'm disappointed. Weren't KGB honeytraps meant to be fiendishly clever? \"Pl-eeeease!\" he hoots. \"No, no, no, no, no, no. No!\" There is a curiously fictional quality about Meyer's charisma. He feels more like a character from a novel or movie than a real person, which perhaps accounts for his striking ease in front of a camera. To describe his politics as profoundly establishment would be an understatement \u2013 but funnily enough, the only time his feathers ruffle is at the end, when I ask if he finds ordinary people a bit boring. \"No!\" He affects injured incredulity. \"Why would I? Decca, there is a huge fallacy in your question, which is the assumption that powerful people are interesting.\" Actually, nothing could be further from the truth; what I meant was that they appear endlessly interesting to him \u2013 so his genuine indignation comes as a surprise. \"Many powerful people are boring as shit,\" he declares. \"And you think, yawn, yawn.\" Seriously? He finds them self-important and two-dimensional? I can scarcely believe it. But Meyer giggles and shudders and nods his head. \"Oh yes, absolutely! Ghastly.\" Networks of Power starts on Tuesday 10 July on Sky Atlantic"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
