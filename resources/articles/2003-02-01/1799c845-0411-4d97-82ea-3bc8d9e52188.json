Barry Cox, the deputy chairman of Channel 4 and chairman of the digital TV stakeholders' group, will say regulators should examine whether to require the satellite firm to separate its business as a platform operator from its business as a provider of channels such as Sky Sports and Sky One. In a lecture at Oxford University, Mr Cox, who is close to Mr Blair and the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, argues a break-up of Sky will turn it into a simple carrier with no opportunity for giving preferential treatment to its own channels or to show bias against rivals. Mr Cox believes the move will help consumers. \"The problem with digital television is that we cannot just pay for what we want,\" he will say. He is proposing the \"drastic\" move after expressing dissatisfaction at the way Sky has tended to sell channels in bundles and the effects this has had on rivals. Managers at ITV Digital complained one of the reasons it collapsed with more than \u00a31bn of debt was the uneconomic rate at which it was forced to buy channels from Sky. In order to recoup a \u00a32bn plus investment in digital infrastructure, Sky has forced customers to buy packages of channels rather than the specific channels they want. Mr Cox claims Sky's dominant position, the result of three strategic moves when it started its pay service in the early 90s, has meant there is now \"no effective competition either within the UK satellite market, nor between different pay TV operators\". However, he insists the new communications super-regulator should investigate the practice of bundling. \"BSkyB is now profitable - it no longer needs the economic prop of forcing viewers into the basic and premium packages it has operated for more than 10 years,\" he says. The former LWT executive's remarks come after years of what he describes as the \"less than brilliant\" regulation of satellite TV. The independent television commission investigated bundling four years ago but left it in place. Last year the office of fair trading decided there were insufficient grounds to conclude Sky had broken any laws. \"Sky has undoubtedly been better organised and better managed than its rivals but it has also been extremely ruthless in its behaviour,\" he says. Mr Cox also calls for Ofcom to introduce tighter regulation of the prices Sky and the cable companies charge consumers for their channels. Following the collapse of ITV Digital, Mr Cox believes channel suppliers are \"in a particularly weak bargaining position\". \"For democratic and culture reasons we need to ensure diversity and quality of supply: leaving this to the commercial judgments of a handful of platform operators is unlikely to be enough to guarantee these crucial outcomes,\" he says. In another recent lecture at Oxford University, Mr Cox called for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped and many of the corporation's services to be made available only on subscription."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
