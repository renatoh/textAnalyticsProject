It is difficult to have sympathy for the AFL in this regard, but for Stephenson, as a young man who fits the targeted audience, a degree of empathy ought to be granted. Of course, it is common sense that players should not be betting on AFL games in the context of match-fixing, but there is also an argument that they should not be betting at all so as to set an example for the younger generation to follow. At an average of $11,000 per adult in Australia, gambling has undoubtedly become an endemic issue. A report published by the Australian Gambling Research Centre found that 23% of respondents had reported being under the age of 18 when they placed their first bet on sports. Further, they noted that AFL and NRL team sponsors are particularly recognisable to children, which becomes an issue due to the widespread use of sports-betting operators as sponsorship entities in these codes. In admitting his fault and that recent events had \u201calmost scared me off gambling altogether\u201d, Stephenson has done more than most within the AFL to mitigate the harm of its relationship with sports gambling. In highlighting his own issues and the immediate impact that it has now had on his professional life, it has come to serve as a warning to impressionable footy fans. Gambling in Australia has become more normalised than ever. This is in part due to the advertising onslaught we have endured over the last few years with same-game multis, early payouts, and odds-boosting inducements being dangled in front of us when we sit down to watch a game of footy. Of course the fault of this lies primarily with the sports betting agencies who knowingly exploit our vulnerabilities in this space to get us to gamble more. As unscrupulous as it may be, this is their job. However, a supreme degree of moral fault lies in the normalisation of this with the sporting codes who are all too complicit. The AFL already has an unhealthy reliance on the revenue it receives through corporate partnerships with gambling agencies. The constant bombardment of sports gambling advertising during games, at games, and even on lighthearted shows such as The Front Bar through segments like Mick\u2019s Multi show that gambling has become intrinsically ingrained into the cultural fabric of the sport. Unfortunately, the AFL administration has failed not only players such as Stephenson in normalising a destructive habit, but also wider society. The financial difficulties, relationship issues, emotional and psychological distress, as well as a gamut of other issues associated with gambling is propagated with the knowing and enthusiastic assistance of our sporting codes. In recalling his period of gambling addiction as a young man living in Paris, Ernest Hemingway remarked in his memoir A Moveable Feast that his former past-time of choice \u201cwasn\u2019t really racing...It was gambling on horses. But we called it racing.\u201d For too many Australians, our past-time of choice isn\u2019t really \u201chaving a punt on the footy\u201d, it is gambling on the AFL, or the cricket, or the rugby, or the outcome of the next federal election, or even the outcome of reality TV shows. But we call it punting. Until we properly address the destructive role entities such as the AFL are playing in normalising these activities, we will be condemning more and more impressionable fans to the harms of sports gambling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
