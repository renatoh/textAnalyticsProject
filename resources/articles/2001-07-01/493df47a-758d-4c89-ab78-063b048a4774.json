A group of researchers from several universities are entering the 7th year of a long-term study of graduates, seeking to establish what impact degrees have on employment and future prospects. Already, from analysing the results of the third year study, one of the researchers involved, Professor Kate Purcell, said it was clear graduates with lower classes of degrees are able to catch up with their peers. \"There is a correlation between the employment people get when they leave university and the degree quality achieved. But, three and a half years on, those who got disappointing results are still entering graduate jobs,\" she explained. A year after they graduate, those with 2.1s are more likely to get the best positions, but gradually all graduates seem to come together. There is every indication the differences in employment are going to have less to do with degree class and more to do with other factors. One of those factors is how far students prove they have the skills employers' want. Those with lower grades might have to work harder and get more experience to measure up against their competitors. However, to isolate what employers actually look for and what really makes a difference to graduates getting a job, a report has been commissioned from Professor Purcell on employers' attitudes. Although she is only half way into the study, and therefore only has early indications, Professor Purcell says, while many employers she has spoken to have been employing people from more diverse races, class and age have not been high on priority lists. The report will be published in the spring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
