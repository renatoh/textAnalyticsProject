Best player on the pitch. TOMMY BOWE WING \u2013 6 Had a sniff of the try line in the second half after a cross-kick by Sexton but had few opportunities to repeat his try-scoring feat against Australia. BRIAN O'DRISCOLL CENTRE, capt \u2013 6 Ireland's leading try-scorer carved through the defence early on but was generally out of sorts. Another fairytale ending this time for Ireland's talisman with a match-winning tackle. PADDY WALLACE CENTRE \u2013 5 Barely lasted a quarter of the game before limping off but showed plenty of enterprise in his few opportunities to run at the Springboks. KEITH EARLS WING \u2013 5 Luke Fitzgerald's replacement had a late chip and chase but had few opportunities in attack. Terrific in defence, though. JONATHAN SEXTON FLY-HALF \u2013 7 Justified his selection ahead of Ronan O'Gara. An early penalty settled any nerves and he shows a swaggering arrogance of a Tony Ward. His kicks won the game. TOMAS O'LEARY SCRUM-HALF \u2013 6 Showed what the Lions missed last summer. An impressive general and made some telling tackles. Outplayed his opposite number. CIAN HEALY PROP \u2013 5 Terrific in the loose against the Wallabies but part of a scrum that took a bit of a battering in the first half. JERRY FLANNERY HOOKER \u2013 6 Gave away four stones to John Smit but his extra mobility was telling in the second half. JOHN HAYES PROP \u2013 6 The heaviest forward on the pitch he struggled in the scrum but made some telling charges into the heart of the Springbok defence. DONNCHA O'CALLAGHAN LOCK \u2013 7 Got stronger as the game progressed and was a key figure in some driving mauls that sucked the strength out of the opposition pack. PAUL O'CONNELL LOCK \u2013 6 The Lions captain gave the Springbok totem Victor Matfield a run for his money in the line-out and showed some deft handling skills. STEPHEN FERRIS FLANKER \u2013 5 An ankle injury prevented him from playing the second half. Ireland missed his strength. DAVID WALLACE FLANKER \u2013 7 Worked tirelessly and made some vital tackles, particularly on de Villiers, late in the game as the Springboks threatened a second try. JAMIE HEASLIP No8 \u2013 7 He was Ireland's most effective ball-carrier in the first half and coped well with some messy ball at the back of the scrum. Ireland's best forward. REPLACEMENTS Sean O'Brien (for Ferris, h-t) A powerful introduction in the second half. Was not overawed by the physical challenge. 7 Gordon D'Arcy (P Wallace, 23) Strengthened his claims to be O'Driscoll's centre partner in the Six Nations. 6 SOUTH AFRICA ZANE KIRCHNER FULL-BACK 6 JP PIETERSEN WING 5 JAQUE FOURIE CENTRE 6 WYNARD OLIVIER CENTRE 5 BRYAN HABANA WING 5 MORNE STEYN FLY-HALF 4 FOURIE DU PREEZ SCRUM-HALF 5 TENDAI MTAWARIRA PROP 5 JOHN SMIT HOOKER, capt 6 BJ BOTHA PROP 5 ANDRIES BEKKER LOCK 5 VICTOR MATFIELD LOCK 6 HEINRICH BRUSSOW FLANKER 7 SCHALK BURGER FLANKER 6 DANIE ROSSOUW No8 5 REPLACEMENTS CJ van der Linde (for Mtawarira 42) 6 Bismarck du Plessis (for BJ Botha 47) 6 Dewald Potgieter (for Bekker 60) 5 Ruan Pienaar (for Steyn 60) 5 Jean de Villiers (for Olivier 63) 5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
