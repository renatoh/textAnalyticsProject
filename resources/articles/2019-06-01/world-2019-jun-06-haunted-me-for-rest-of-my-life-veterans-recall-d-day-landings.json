It was a terrible day. So, as the dwindling few who bore witness to the monumental feat of endeavour and ingenuity of D-day returned to Normandy\u2019s beaches, emotions were conflicted. Street parties, flypasts, swing bands and sing-a-longs contrasted with solemn ceremonies where the celebratory was vastly outweighed by reminders of the scale of human sacrifice. On the seafront at Arromanches, overlooking Gold beach where 75 years ago a blue-grey armada had filled the horizon as far as the eye could see, a lone piper marked H-hour. It was the moment at 7.26am when the first British soldier landed on Gold beach exactly 75 years ago. The lone piper Maj Macey-Lille, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (the Scottish Gunners), stood atop the decaying vestige of the Mulberry harbour still embedded in the sand, to play Highland Laddie as crowds gathered. For veterans who had returned to Normandy, seeing the beaches and the quiet villages, now household names, that they fought their way through in France, is still overwhelming. Memories were of running for the dunes, bullets bouncing, shells screaming, beaches vibrating as the allied naval guns pounded German targets to provide cover for those going in. The cemeteries are particularly emotional. \u201cYou think to yourself, all them lying there, why aren\u2019t I one of them? Because I were with them,\u201d says Ray Mellors, 94, from Nottingham, who as an 18-year-old with the South Staffordshire Regiment, had waded through the sea, \u201cin the dark and wet\u201d, towards Sword beach shortly after D-day. \u201cIt\u2019s haunted me for the rest of my life. I sit here now, and I think to myself \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here, really. I should be under the ground where the others are\u2019.\u201d When his battalion was decimated, he was part of the reserves, waiting to be placed with others to replace men they had lost. He first joined the Welch Regiment, then the Black Watch, moving through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and finally, Germany. \u201cAnd, I was always thinking to myself \u2018my time is going to come, I know it is\u2019. But it didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot going on,\u201d says John Eden, 94, from Silverdale, Morecambe Bay, who as a 19-year-old private in the 12th (Airborne) Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment landed the day after D-day. \u201cThis brings back feelings you don\u2019t really want to feel.\u201d He says: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I was a terrified little lad.\u201d He could not explain why he had been drawn back. \u201cWhat can you say? I had four years in the army, and this was part of it, an experience that you can\u2019t comprehend, can you? You can\u2019t imagine how you did it\u201d. At Ranville war cemetery, he planned to visit \u201ctwo particular graves\u201d for fallen comrades. Away from the cemeteries, there is a carnival atmosphere on Normandy\u2019s streets during the 75th commemorations. Many, still find it unbelievable that local people will come up, shake their hand, and say thank you. Revisiting the small villages, Douglas Russell, 97, who lives in Morecambe, was surprised at the warm welcome. \u201cAll the people that have turned up, people shaking my hand. It\u2019s nice. But I\u2019m not a hero, just an ordinary chap.\u201d This is the first time he has returned since landing on Sword beach, with the 43rd Wessex infantry division two days after D-day. \u201cSeeing all the crowds has amazed me. I am glad I came. At my time of life it\u2019s the only chance I\u2019ll get, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He went all the way to Berlin. His job was to treat the water from rivers and streams to ensure that his men had safe drinking water. James Anderson, 97, a signalman, was seconded to the Norwegian destroyer Glaisdale, which on D-day escorted the Canadians to Juno beach, firing on the German defences to soften them before the troops ran for the beach, then closing in to provide cover. \u201cWe were hitting machine-gun posts. \u201cAnd, as the firing destroyed a house, the house would fall on the machine gunner and give them more protection, so we had to go really close in and get rid of them,\u201d he says. He watched those on the landing crafts struggle through the waves under fire to reach the shore. \u201cAll the landing craft were flat bottomed, and I felt very sorry for the men because most of them were seasick. Then they had to go onshore against the enemy. Not very good.\u201d He spent the rest of June 1944 protecting the beach, until his ship hit a mine, and he was injured. They were towed back to the UK where he was hospitalised for two weeks. \u201cI know I am the only one left from my ship, now,\u201d he says. This was the second time he had returned to Normandy. He had never wanted to come back before. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunately part of your life, and when the war finished, all I wanted to do was get back to my wife, and rear a family, and forget it,\u201d says Anderson, from Manchester, who went on to work for an advertising agency. Visiting the cemeteries would be hard, he says. \u201cI know I am not going to like it when we get to Omaha and see the American cemetery. Those numbers of graves are just too much.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
