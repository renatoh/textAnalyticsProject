Corn and Mussel Chowder Chosen by Jody Adams, the James Beard award-winning chef owner of Rialto, Cambridge, MA Serves 4 as a main course 3 ears of corn, husked 2 large leeks, white and light green parts 1 stalk celery 2 bay leaves 2 chipotle peppers, dried or canned, if using canned, rinse \u00bd tsp fennel seeds, crushed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 225g waxy potatoes, cut into \u00bdin pieces 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp chopped garlic (6 medium cloves) 900g cleaned mussels 1\u00bd cups white wine 1 tbsp loosely packed fresh thyme leaves stripped from stem, unchopped\u2013save the stems 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes, about 225g \u00bc cup chopped parsley\u2013save the stems Method: Strip the corn kernels from the cobs. Run the back side of your knife down the cobs. You will have a corn puree. Add that to the kernels then cut each cob into four pieces. Dice the whites of the leeks and slice the green part of the leeks crosswise. Trim off the top and bottom of the celery stalk and set aside. Peel the remaining stalk, chop into \u00bdin dice. Put the cobs into a pot, along with the leek coins, the end trimmings of celery, the bay leaves, chipotle peppers, crushed fennel seed and the stems of the thyme and parsley if you saved them. Season with salt and pepper, add four cups of water, bring to a boil, then let simmer for 35mins. Strain into a clean pot, remove the chipotles, put into a bowl, and mash with the back of a fork. Add the potatoes to the strained broth, bring back to a boil and simmer for seven minutes until just tender. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the potatoes to cool in the liquid. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced leeks, the diced celery and the garlic. Season with salt and pepper, cover and cook for three minutes to soften the vegetables. Remove the cover and continue cooking until they just start to colour. Add the corn kernels, mussels, wine, thyme leaves and the mashed chipotles. Cover and cook until the mussels just open, 3-5mins. Discard any that don't open. Transfer the mussels to a rimmed sheet pan. Remove mussels from shells and discard the shells. Remove any remaining beards, but leave any of the corn mixture clinging to the mussels alone. Set the mussels aside. Add the broth with the potatoes to the pan used to cook the mussels. Add the cream and tomatoes and simmer everything for four minutes. Add the mussels and parsley and heat through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
