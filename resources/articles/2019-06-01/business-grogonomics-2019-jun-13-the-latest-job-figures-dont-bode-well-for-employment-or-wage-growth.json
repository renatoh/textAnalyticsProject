The quarterly labour account figures that are now released the week after the GDP figures try to fill the gap that exists between the monthly labour force figures and the national accounts. While the monthly figures that gives us the unemployment rate are focused on the number of people employed, these quarterly figures look specifically at the number of jobs. The March quarter figures have some tiny bit of good news in that the proportion of jobs that are \u201csecondary\u201d jobs seems to have fallen. But we should not get too excited at the thought that fewer people are having to work two jobs. The drop comes from a rather large 3.8% fall in the seasonally adjusted figure (the biggest such fall for six years): That figure might hold up, but history suggests a rebound will occur in the June quarter. As it is nearly 80% of the fall in secondary jobs came from just three industries \u2013 arts and recreation, administration and support, and accommodation and food services. Given those three industries account for just 35% of all secondary jobs, it was a rather outsized drop. The percentage of jobs that are secondary still remains high \u2013 at 6.9% it is well above the 6.2% level of five years ago \u2013 a difference of around 100,000 more people working in a second job: The good news is the level of main jobs continues to grow \u2013 in trend terms it actually improved in the March quarter \u2013 but the overall number of filled jobs grew at a slower rate of 0.6% \u2013 equal slowest for two years: The use of \u201cfilled\u201d jobs is crucial as it differentiates between the total number of jobs available and those which are yet to have anyone employed. The ABS measures the difference with what it calls the \u201cproportion of vacant jobs\u201d. In the latest figures the vacancy level has risen slightly but looks to be flattening out: This is important because much like the more traditional vacancy rate, which measures the number of job vacancies per number of people in the labour force, a higher figure is usually better. The higher the level of job vacancies, the more businesses that are looking to hire, which is generally a good sign. But the flattening of the proportion of vacant jobs is usually a bad sign. It can occur because the level of hiring is rising faster than is the level of vacancies (not necessarily a bad thing) or, which is the current situation, because the growth of job vacancies is slowing: At the end of 2017 the number of job vacancies grew by 5.1% while the number of filled jobs grew by 0.8% \u2013 a sure sign that businesses were looking to hire. But in the first quarter of this year while the number of filled jobs grew by 0.6% the number of job vacancies increased just 1.5% \u2013 the slowest for more than four years. That does not bode well for future job growth. But the interesting aspect of this data is the ABS breaks it down by industry, which gives us some insight into issues that are occurring in the economy. The demand for workers in the construction sector remains strong, but the growth in the number of filled jobs is slowing \u2013 just 0.4% more jobs filled in the first three months this year, the slowest rate for two years: It suggests that businesses might now be reaching a stage of struggling to get workers for construction jobs \u2013 and a likely need to increase wages to attract and retain workers. A similar, though less extreme situation is also occurring in the healthcare and social assistance sector. While the 1.2% growth of filled jobs is slowing, there is 5% growth of job vacancies: By contrast the mining sector is one where the growth of job vacancies has recently collapsed, and is now increasing at much the same rate as the number of filled jobs \u2013 suggesting little signs of increased employment growth in that sector: Across all industries, construction, healthcare and education are the three where the level of demand for workers most outstrips the growth in actual jobs being filled; while wholesale trade, other services and information media and telecommunication are the three where the number of jobs filled is actually growing faster than the job vacancies. Overall however the gap between the growth of job vacancies and filled jobs is now closer than it has been since 2014: This suggests the period of strong demand for work we saw in 2017 and 2018, which led to strong employment growth, looks to be over. And while this does not necessarily mean a rise in unemployment is likely, it provides little sense of any push for stronger wages from employers desperate to get workers in the near future. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
