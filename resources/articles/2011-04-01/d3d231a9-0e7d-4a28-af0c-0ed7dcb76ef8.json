The logic went that if, say, David Beckham has got it we would all want it too because he has way better hair and doesn't gorge on chocolate HobNobs. But since the Originals campaign proved such a success by mixing party goers with the likes of Missy Elliot, Daft Punk and even the bloody N-Dubz, Adidas has insisted on putting - ewww - regular people in its ads too. The new Adidas \"Is All In\" campaign really does tell anyone that they can live life to the full if only they were wearing polyester. Of course there are stars of sport and music: Lionel Messi's there, as well as a pouting Katy Perry, pop-botherer B.o.B and DJ Mehdi (who knew what he looked like?). But the celebs are dramatically cut with images of cheering crowds, street fighters, skaters and cheerleaders. There's even a couple of chubby football fans and some smiley riot police wandering around, bang on trend thanks to Plan B, Take That and kettling. Adidas has also taken care to recruit talent behind the scenes. The commercial is directed by Romain-Gavras, the arty Frenchman best known for killing some gingers in MIA's Born Free video. Justice also provide the soundtrack, much to the delight of bloggers and ravers, who will now celebrate the Adidas brand in the customary fashion by going without sleep for a week. It seems unlikely that the same people who get off on seeing Messi will be enthused by Justice, or the Justice fans giddy at the sight of Katy Perry. By trying to make everyone happy, it's conceivable that Adidas could just turn everyone off instead. See the ad here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
