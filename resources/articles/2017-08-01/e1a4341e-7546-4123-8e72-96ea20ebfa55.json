The government aims to avoid the need for border posts with Ireland when the UK leaves the EU, an ambitious goal seen as essential to preserving the Good Friday peace agreement. \u201cThe UK and Ireland have been clear all along that we need to prioritise protecting the Belfast agreement in these negotiations, and ensure the land border is as seamless as possible for people and businesses,\u201d said David Davis, the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary. Details of the plan unveiled by Whitehall officials have, however, sparked a series of difficult questions about what the knock-on impact of having no border may be for wider EU-UK relations. The issue of the Irish border is a priority for the next round of Brexit talks, due to resume in two weeks. However, some senior government figures now concede privately that the talks may not move on to the substantive issue of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union until December, cutting the time left for complex discussions before the two-year article 50 deadline. One cabinet minister with knowledge of the negotiations told the Guardian on Wednesday it is \u201cimpossible to know\u201d whether they will succeed in tying up initial questions, including the withdrawal bill, by October, as they had previously hoped. When the talks do resume, Britain will ask for an exemption for all small traders and farmers from a host of customs, agricultural and food safety checks. In return, it aims to seek \u201cregulatory equivalence\u201d with the EU to try to avoid the need for inspections of live animals and billions of pounds worth of goods. Officials refuse to speculate what consequences this may have for limiting the scope of trade agreements with non-compliant countries such as the US. Without matching regulations, the EU could block imports, fearing that the open border was a back door into its consumer market. Similar fears of a back door in the labour market were put to officials when they revealed there would be nothing to stop EU economic migrants travelling through the Republic of Ireland and into the UK under a continuation of the common travel area scheme. The government believes it can limit the impact of any such undocumented immigration through tighter checks on UK work permits. Critics pointed out that the absence of border checks would appear to contradict a key aspect of leave campaigners\u2019 pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d, while officials concede the plan relies on unprecedented trust and cooperation with the EU, but say it is worth it to maintain peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \u201cThis plan has more holes in it than a colander. The Brexiteers claimed it was worth damaging the UK economy to reclaim control of our borders, now we\u2019re told even this isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Pro-EU Labour MP Pat McFadden said: \u201cFor the second day running the government is trying to reinvent the wheel. The obvious solution to frictionless trade and the border issues with Northern Ireland is to stay within the customs union. This gives us easy access to trade within the EU and makes us party to a number of trade agreements around the world. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, welcomed the document\u2019s clarity, but said the arrangements on customs facilitation would be difficult, given the UK\u2019s proposals to negotiate separate free trade agreements at the same time. He also warned that Ireland would not allow itself to be \u201cused as a pawn\u201d in the Brexit talks if the UK tried to use border negotiations to gain wider leverage in Brussels. The European commission welcomed the UK\u2019s position papers \u201cas a positive step towards really starting phase one of the negotiations. The clock is ticking and these will allow us to make progress.\u201d Whitehall officials concede that a reason for their flurry of policy papers this week is to try to end the deadlock over divorce talks by demonstrating that everything is interconnected and must be discussed together. Perhaps the toughest negotiating issue in Brussels and Dublin will be UK proposals to exempt Northern Ireland\u2019s food producers from sanitary and phytosanitary checks in place to ensure animal welfare and consumer health standards are maintained for any imports into the EU single market. \u201cWe think if we can reach a deep enough equivalence arrangement with the EU it is possible to do that via processes that don\u2019t involve the land border,\u201d said one government official briefing journalists on the plan. \u201cWe believe we have got a strong track record on food safety. We think this can be done in a way that doesn\u2019t introduce food safety and veterinary risks into the system.\u201d Britain will have to tread a fine line between satisfying European import concerns and not ceding all control over food and agriculture regulation to Brussels, or preventing any trade deals with third-party countries that may want exemptions on products such as genetically modified crops or hormone-treated beef. The UK is expected to argue that for the purposes of health checks and customs tariffs much of the trade across the border is in effect local, not international, trade and should be exempted from controls that exist elsewhere in the EU in order to maintain borderless travel. Concerns have also been raised about the implications of allowing people to continue to travel without any checks, and whether this outsources UK immigration policy to the Irish Republic. The Home Office refused to comment on Wednesday night on reports that it has drawn up plans for EU citizens to continue to come to Britain and look for work after Brexit, while controlling how many will be allowed to stay by limiting the number of work permits issued. Amber Rudd is expected to publish proposals in the coming weeks on what is likely to be one of the most controversial aspects of post-Brexit policy-making. The UK government says that maintaining the common travel area should be possible because security and immigration checks are often carried out far away from the border already. It concedes, however, that the plan relies on Ireland staying outside the Schengen travel zone. \u201cControls we introduce away from the physical border allow you to complete the required checks,\u201d said the Whitehall official. \u201cPeople can still be picked up for security purposes.\u201d This has sparked fears of an increase in electronic tracking, whereby electronic surveillance is used instead of physical border security. \u201cUsing untested technology to police the border won\u2019t instil a great deal of confidence,\u201d said William Foster, a partner at the immigration law firm Fragomen. \u201cThe biggest question for businesses is what will this mean day to day? Will people be tracked when they drive from Belfast to Galway? Will software be used to log their movements?\u201d UK officials said they did not recognise such fears and said there would be no increase in number plate recognition cameras at the border. Brussels has said it wants to see \u201csufficient progress\u201d in a deal on the Irish border during the first phase of Brexit negotiations, before talks are allowed to progress to future trade ties. The UK has contended that the timetable is artificial, because any agreement on the Irish border will be linked to future customs rules. A European commission spokeswoman added that the border question was more than just a trade issue. \u201cWe must discuss how to maintain the common travel area and protect in all its dimensions the Good Friday agreement of which the United Kingdom is a co-guarantor. It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
