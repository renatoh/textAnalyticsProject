As Gloucester discovered last year, topping the Zurich Premiership table after a nine-month season is irrelevant unless that effort can be distilled into 80 minutes at Twickenham today, and once again the dark shadow of Wasps hovers menacingly. If the sense of anticipation is not quite what it should be, the complaint is not the usual one. This time the traditionalists' argument has been weakened by the prolonged absence of so many top players on World Cup and Six Nations duty; sadly, whoever decided to stage the grand final six days after Europe's ultimate club showpiece on the same ground was seriously tempting fate. Even had Wasps not achieved their epic Heineken Cup victory over Toulouse last Sunday there would have been a genuine risk of this contest proving a wafer-thin mint too far after a season of countless delicacies and the case for concluding the domestic calendar a week before the Heineken Cup final is becoming unanswerable. Next year will be even trickier, with negotiations continuing to prevent the Lions departing for New Zealand with only half their squad, but Bath's coach John Connolly has more pressing issues, not least trying to ensure his side do not collapse as spectacularly as Gloucester, beaten 39-3 last season having lost all momentum during the three-week break they had earned for finishing top. \"The upside of it is you shouldn't pick up injuries but the downside is that you go in cold and that's wrong,\" says Connolly. A run-out at Newbury last week is not the same as tackling Europe's finest and the feeling in the Wasps camp is that the Toulouse experience will prove beneficial. That is the view of their flanker Paul Volley, who may be playing his last game for the club before moving to Castres. \"We know we can win it; it's just a mental thing with so little recovery time after the Toulouse game. The way we trained in midweek I think we'll be up for it.\" Bath's strongest suit will be in defence and at the lineout, two more reasons to predict a close, physical game. The better news for Wasps is that in conquering Europe they were not as accurate and efficient as they can be. \"The result was fantastic but the performance can improve,\" insists the director of rugby Warren Gatland. \"If we'd been sitting here saying 'What a great result, we played brilliantly' it would be mentally harder to get ourselves up.\" Others will be monitoring Bath's Danny Grewcock, mindful of his red card for hitting Lawrence Dallaglio in last season's Parker Pen final, and the preceding Wildcard final between Leicester and Sale, wondering how many of the England summer tour party will survive intact. It could make painful viewing for Bath fans and Sir Clive Woodward.
