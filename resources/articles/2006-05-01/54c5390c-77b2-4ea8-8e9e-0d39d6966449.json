Police are searching for Rey-Bellet's husband, Gerold Stadler, a 34-year-old private banker, in connection with the two killings, said Philippe Medico, examining magistrate in the Swiss canton of Valais. Mr Stadler's car was found in a nearby village, Mr Medico told reporters in nearby St Maurice. The motive appeared to have been a marital problem, he said, adding that Ms Rey-Bellet and Mr Stadler separated last month. Ms Rey-Bellet's mother was in hospital with serious injuries after the attack late on Sunday in the Swiss mountain resort of Les Crosets, Valais cantonal police said. Police said the attacker entered the house and fired five shots. He had already fled the scene when police arrived and eluded an immediate search. Ms Rey-Bellet's mother, although injured, was able to call the emergency services. The couple's two-year-old son - who was in the house but on a different floor - was unhurt and is being kept in secure accommodation, a police spokesman, Renato Kalbermatten, said. Ms Rey-Bellet, 33, who lived with Mr Stadler and her son in Abtwil, in northeast Switzerland, was considered to be one of the world's top skiers when she was forced to retire three years ago. She narrowly missed out on an Olympic medal in Salt Lake City in 2002, finishing in fifth place in the downhill. \"To come fifth is heart-breaking because it's so close,\" she said at the time. She shared a 2003 World Championships silver medal in the downhill at St Moritz but retired shortly afterwards because of a series of injuries to her right knee. The skier had her first podium finish in 1992, when she placed third in the World Cup final. In 1999, she won the downhill and Super-G at the World Cup in St Anton, Austria. By Monday afternoon, fans had left hundreds of messages of condolence on Ms Rey-Bellet's website. \"We're shaken by the tragedy. We send our condolences to the family members and express our deep sorrow,\" the website's administrators said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
