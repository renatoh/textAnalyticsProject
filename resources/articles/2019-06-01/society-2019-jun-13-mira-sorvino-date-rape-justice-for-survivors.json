Sorvino, who was one of the first women to accuse the film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, spoke during a news conference with New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, in support of the push to drop the statute of limitations on rape allegations. Sorvino acknowledged that talking publicly about Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct had been traumatic, saying: \u201cI had not really sought out the help I needed\u201d, but revealed she had another previously undisclosed experience with a man she did not identify. \u201cI can stand here before you and say not only was I a sexual harassment and battery victim at the hands of Mr Weinstein, but I\u2019m also a sexual assault victim and I\u2019m also a survivor of date rape.\u201d Sorvino said she wouldn\u2019t go into details, but wanted to disclose the assault to help others. \u201cI am doing it here to try and help, because there are all these survivors out there right now who need justice, who need to feel that they can take the time they need to sort through the trauma, to sort through the shame,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I can tell you in situations of second degree rape, which is what mine would constitute, you feel ashamed. You feel that somehow it was your fault.\u201d In New York, second-degree rape involves victims who cannot consent to sexual activity, either because of their age, mental capacity or state of inebriation. Advocates want lawmakers to repeal the state\u2019s statute of limitations for second- and third-degree rape and change the law to make it easier for victims to prove harassment claims. Cuomo, a Democrat, thanked Sorvino for being \u201cbrave and courageous\u201d after listening to her speak. In 2018, Sorvino \u2013 the star of Mighty Aphrodite \u2013 alleged Weinstein had sexually harassed her when they worked on a project together in 1995. The filmmaker Peter Jackson later said that Weinstein had allegedly told him not to consider her for a role in The Lord of the Rings because she was difficult to work with. A spokesperson for Weinstein denied he had any input on casting choices. Sorvino is one of more than 80 women who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. In May it was reported that Weinstein reached a tentative $44m deal to resolve several lawsuits and compensate women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. He still faces criminal charges of rape and performing a forcible sex act, and is set to go on trial in New York in September. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
