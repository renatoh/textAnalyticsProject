He planned to take the ferry to mainland Europe from Dover. \u201cFirst, I had to take the train from London to the coast and I arrived at Victoria station with lots of luggage.\u201d Edward realised there was a mistake on his ticket and he needed to speak to a supervisor. He spotted Anja Langenstein standing at the station and asked if she would watch his bags. \u201cShe looked lovely and was very tall so she stood out.\u201d When they arrived at Dover, he saw her again, struggling with her own ticket. Edward went over to help and they struck up a conversation. \u201cI asked whether he would sit with me on the boat,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m from Germany and we have a reputation for being very direct.\u201d Edward says he was \u201cbowled over\u201d by the request. \u201cShe was so pretty,\u201d he says. It was a warm evening and the pair played cards on deck. \u201cIt was such a clear night, we could see the stars and both sides of the coast,\u201d says Edward. They chatted continuously for four hours, with Anja describing him as \u201ca very British gentleman\u201d. She told him she had been in Wales visiting friends and had stopped in Shrewsbury, staying just 10 minutes from where Edward\u2019s family lived. When the ferry arrived in Belgium they went their separate ways. Anja was travelling to Stuttgart, where she was studying, while Edward was heading on to Zurich. \u201cI gave him my address, but he didn\u2019t give me his. Apparently, he didn\u2019t have one,\u201d says Anja, with a laugh. \u201cWe were really sad to get on different trains. I decided to write to her as soon as I got to Zurich,\u201d says Edward. For seven months, they wrote letters, which they have kept. Then Anja decided to visit. \u201cBecause of the post, I didn\u2019t have much notice that she was coming,\u201d says Edward. \u201cIt was me taking the initiative again to get us to meet up,\u201d she says. They spent the weekend together before Anja returned to Stuttgart. A few weeks later, Edward went to visit her and they became an official couple. For the next year, they travelled between the two cities to see each other. Edward\u2019s stay in Zurich was extended, but he returned to Manchester in June 1987 to do a PhD. Anja joined him shortly afterwards and continued her training as a librarian. From 1988-9 she was officially based in Stuttgart to complete her studies, but found she could do much of the work from Manchester. \u201cI asked Anja to marry me at the end of 1988,\u201d says Edward. \u201cWe arranged the wedding for September the following year in the UK. By coincidence, the vicar spoke German so we had a bilingual wedding.\u201d In 1990, Anja became pregnant and the couple moved to Bavaria in Germany. \u201cBeing from different countries, we had to decide where we wanted to settle,\u201d says Edward. Their son arrived in February 1991, followed by a daughter in 1995. Edward transferred to the electronics and software industry, while Anja spent her career working in libraries and book stores. \u201cI had a book shop for eight years and now work in the international office at Munich University,\u201d she says. The couple share a passion for travel, and often visited different European cities before the pandemic. \u201cAnja is great at planning holidays. She plans nine months ahead,\u201d says Edward. \u201cYes, I\u2019m definitely the pushy one,\u201d she adds, laughing. Anja appreciates her husband\u2019s reliability, and says they are best friends. \u201cHe\u2019s so English and such a polite gentleman. I still fall for that. At the start he was even too British to argue \u2013 I had to teach him.\u201d Edward loves his wife\u2019s zest for life. \u201cBeing a physicist I like new things. She\u2019s always coming up with new, unexpected suggestions,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all these years I still love her so much. We speak every day, even when we are apart.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
