About 14,000 people, including a number of survivors and bereaved relatives, packed into the venue last night to hear an eclectic lineup topped by Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds. The Oasis star was joined by other Mancunian musicians, including the Courteeners, grime act Bugzy Malone and indie band Blossoms, from nearby Stockport. The somewhat confusing programme also included a turn from Rick Astley, who deviated from his 1980s hits with a cover of Everlong by Foo Fighters. Former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle and Pixie Lott were also in attendance. Peter Kay, the comedian, introduced Gallagher as \u201cMr Manchester himself, all the way from London\u201d. Kay wore the yellow fleece of the Arena stewards \u2013 he worked at the venue for four years from its opening day in July 1995, when he earned \u00a34.10 an hour. He eschewed any jokes for the first few minutes of his brief set, urging the crowd to \u201cmove forward with love and not hate\u201d. Gallagher played a set that was roughly 50:50 Oasis hits and new songs including Half the World Away, dedicated to \u201cManchester\u2019s favourite family, the Royle Family\u201d [it was the theme tune to the TV series], Champagne Supernova and of course Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger, which Gallagher said \u201chas become a kind of anthem\u201d post attack. \u201cEvery time you sing we win. So sing!\u201d The evening, under the banner We Are Manchester, began with a set by DJ Clint Boon, formerly of the Inspiral Carpets, who gave Gallagher a gig as a roadie before his Oasis days. The first song was the Stone Roses\u2019 Made of Stone, a tribute to the city\u2019s spirit. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, then read out the names of those killed. There was an appearance by poet Tony Walsh, whose love letter to Manchester, This Is the Place, became a rallying cry in the days after the bomb and was released as a charity single. The event sold out in hours, disappointing some of the families, who were unable to get tickets. There were no freebies; everyone from Burnham to Gallagher\u2019s guest list had to pay \u00a325 or \u00a330 for a ticket, with all proceeds going to the memorial fund. Airport-style security had been installed, with the audience searched as they attended the first concert since the attack at an Ariane Grande show. At the City Rooms entrance, where Salman Abedi detonated his nail bomb, a group of teenagers from Garstang in Lancashire were crying. \u201cThe girls were all at the Ariana Grande concert. For two of them, it was their first concert on their own,\u201d said Sharon Hartley, the mother of 14-year-old Ella. \u201cWe are all struggling a bit.\u201d They went off to seek \u201cemotional first aid\u201d from Foundation for Peace, the Warrington-based charity set up in memory of IRA victims Johnathan Ball and Tim Parry. Mental health professionals and trauma experts who worked with victims of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles were available to talk to anyone who needed support. Karen Watson from Lancaster had bought a bunch of chrysanthemums, which she left by the temporary memorial in Victoria station. It had been a little eerie walking through the bomb site, she said. \u201cYou keep thinking of all those little girls with their pink balloons and bunny ears.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
