Parks constructs grand overviews of Dante's Inferno (the title essay), the work of Sebald, and the non-fiction of Borges, among others. His civilised and witty prose is a delight, even if sometimes you feel the leisurely tempo has half an eye on filling the space, and even if some peremptory judgments occasionally irk. (Parks unaccountably considers the wonderfully humane rambling of Jos\u00e9 Saramago's narrators to be simple \"facetiousness\".) His demolition of Rushdie's The Ground Beneath Her Feet is exemplary: starting from an old Rushdie simile about how writing fiction is like juggling balls, he writes: \"The pages are very soon, with respect, so full of balls that the mind can only boggle.\" That \"with respect\", meaning quite the opposite of what it says and serving as a gleeful signpost to the joke, is very nice indeed. The Hunt for Zero Point, by Nick Cook (Arrow, \u00a36.99) What is going on? It seems the US military have anti-gravity technology, of the sort that enabled Daleks to negotiate stairways. Cook's globe-trotting investigations begin with a titillating article placed on his desk at Jane's Defence Weekly, and go on to alternate between the \"white world\" of official documentation and a \"black world\" of shadowy meetings with Nasa and Pentagon sources. He considers theories that the B-2 stealth bomber employs some kind of anti-gravity drive, and goes back to the heady days of 1956, when the aerospace industry announced that it was on the verge of perfecting this revolutionary technology - after which, suspiciously, nothing at all happened. As it turns out, the seed was secret experiments by the Nazis during the second world war. Yes, it all sounds barking, but Cook's hard-headed style is entertaining, and he hardly seems like a credulous conspiracy nut. Back on the Road, by Ernesto 'Che' Guevara (Vintage, \u00a37.99) A kind of sequel to The Motorcycle Diaries, this describes Guevara's two-year journey around Latin America between 1953 and 1955: trooping along the Andes to Mexico, looking at Incan ruins in Bolivia and Mayan remains in Peru, and investigating allergies and the physiology of cats. Compared to The Motorcycle Diaries, it is a patchy text, not burnished after the fact for publication: it is a mixture of journal entries and letters home (mostly to his mother). This can make for some laconic comedy: in Lima, for example, \"we went to see the famous 3-D at a cinema. It doesn't seem at all revolutionary to me and the films are the same as before.\" The trip culminated, the blurb says grandly, in a meeting with Fidel Castro, which might lead us to expect a splendid scene of proleptic revolutionary theorising; but the author says only this: \"He is a young, intelligent guy, very sure of himself and extraordinarily audacious; I think we hit it off well.\" Universality, by Mark Ward (Pan, \u00a37.99) A prime example of overselling a concept, Universality takes ideas in complexity and criticality theory and tries to weave them into a grand explanation of \"life, the universe and everything\". A terribly portentous introduction claims that this idea is more important than a grand, unified theory in physics, because it tells us what the meaning of life is. Er, it doesn't. Instead there is a lot of familiar stuff on fractal patterns in nature, and the similarities between sand piles and stock-market fluctuations, internet surfing patterns and the human brain. The terminology seems somewhat confused. \"Universality is the opposite of chaos,\" Ward insists, shortly before saying that chaos theory is \"one of the intellectual cousins of Universality theory\". Stretching his idea beyond any useful limits, he gives himself away with lots of \"mights\" and \"possiblys\": \"The origins of life might owe quite a debt to these forces.\" Well, yes, they might, if they were forces. Which they aren't."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
