A virus at Paul Cole's Whatcombe stables had put the four-year-old into a quarantine that excluded even the trainer from his presence, and Pirri was banned from contact with other horses in the run-up the stayers' classic. When Kieren Fallon sent the 3-1 second favourite cruising into the lead as the field turned into the finishing straight, the bay colt looked the healthiest horse in England. The winning margin was six lengths over the front-running Persian Punch, with Pole Star third and the 5-2 favourite Mamool in fifth place, the first of a lacklustre trio of Godolphin runners. On a Ladies' Day in which the mostly dull skies and intermittent breezes did nothing for the diaphanous pastels and wind-catching hats in the royal enclosure Mr Dinos's supremacy drained the excitement from the feature race but not the emotion, as the winning trainer made clear. \"We've had a terrible few weeks,\" Cole said. \"It happens to all trainers and it was my turn. We isolated him quite a while ago and took steps to keep him out of danger.\" In the run-up to the race, however, the virus was overtaken in Cole's list of concerns by the going, which was on the firm side of good. \"I got wound up about the ground,\" he said. \"You're always looking for problems and that became a big one. He could have not gone on it and then I'd have felt dreadful. I knew he'd stay. That's not a problem for him. But he destroyed them. I didn't quite expect that.\" A week and a half after his Derby triumph on Kris Kin, Fallon was given work to do by Mr Dinos. \"He travelled well all the way even though he was lazy,\" the champion jockey said. \"He wasn't taking me fast enough, so I thought I'd better use his stamina. When I switched him on, he found another gear. That's the sign of a good horse.\" To the delight of the crowd the early stages had been enlivened by the irrepressible initiative of Persian Punch, the 10-year-old with a long and glorious history of setting the pace in the Gold Cup. Second in 2001, the chestnut giant has been unplaced on five other occasions but has usually shown a fondness for giving his rivals something to aim at. Priced at 20-1 as he and his jockey, Martin Dwyer, made their way up to the start, he was unperturbed by a male streaker whose appearance had sent Mamool sprinting up the course. He was already two lengths ahead of Black Sam Bellamy and Mr Dinos as they approached the grandstands for the first time, and Dwyer maintained his advantage around the back of the course. When Fallon urged Mr Dinos up to his shoulder and into the lead about half a mile from home, Persian Punch had enough strength left to hold off the field as they raced for the line. Frankie Dettori held Mamool, unbeaten in his two previous races this year, in midfield throughout the race. Although his mount had narrowly beaten Mr Dinos over two miles in the Queen's Vase here a year ago, the extra half-mile simply took the Cypriot-owned winner further into the distance. While Mr Dinos's connections accepted congratulations, Persian Punch's owner was receiving almost as many plaudits. Jeff Smith, whose Winchester-based company makes parts for aeroplane interiors, bought the horse as a yearling. He has seen him win 16 times in 56 starts and bring home around \u00a3800,000 in prize money, not including \u00a355,000 for yesterday's effort. \"He's everything you could possibly want in a horse,\" Smith said. \"His temperament is cast iron. He just enjoys the game of racing. To get in front of the others and make them chase him is what he lives for. It would have been wonderful to win but to get round and finish second is fantastic. That's seven Golds Cups and one Queen's Vase he hasn't won, but never mind. They've all been wonderful occasions. This year we came here hoping he'd run well and finish fourth, or something respectable. But take the winner out of it and he'd have brought the house down.\" And would he be back next year? \"God willing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
