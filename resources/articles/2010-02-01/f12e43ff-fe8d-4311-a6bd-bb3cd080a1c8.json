Today is all about the past. The 34 years since Manchester City last won a major trophy. The 38 years since Stoke City last won a major trophy. And the five years since Patrick Vieira last kicked a ball in the FA Cup, when he rifled an unsaveable penalty past Roy Carroll to win the cup for Arsenal and kept running all the way to Turin. Happy memories. The FA Cup may be a second-tier competition these days, but nobody at Eastlands tonight will give even a solitary one about that. Nor should they. As I suspect most of you who are reading an internet report on a Saturday evening in lieu of a life will know full well, all that matters after a long drought is that you notch, not what or how you do so. Brian Clough always said that the humble Texaco Cup was the most important trophy he ever won at Nottingham Forest, because it was the first and gave his players the taste. In 10 years' time, as they bathe in money, eat nothing other than white trufffles and are chasing a seventh consecutive European Cup, Manchester City will look back and laugh at how much the little old FA Cup used to mean. But for the next few hours it is their world entire; and with three of The Group I'm Getting Really Tired Of Having To Call The Big Four, With Capital Letters And All out of the competition, they have a real chance of winning it this season. There will be significant obstacles to overcome, not least City's own Jamie Polllock Gene and also Chelsea, but you'd expect them to take care of Stoke tonight. Kick off is at 5.15pm Team news Carlos Tevez has apparently returned home to Argentina for the birth of his child. Patrick Vieira is on the bench. So is Rory Delap, which means the ball will be in play for more than a few minutes of this match. Matthew Etherington will probably start on the right wing, which will put him up against the brilliant Martin Petrov. Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Given; Zabaleta, Toure, Lescott, Bridge; De Jong, Barry; Wright-Phillips, Ireland, Petrov; Adebayor. Substitutes: Taylor, Onouha, Santa Cruz, Garrido, Sylvinho, Vieira, Boyata. Stoke City (4-4-2) Sorensen; Huth, Shawcross, Higginbotham, Wilkinson; Etherington, Diao, Whelan, Tuncay; Sidibe, Fuller. Substitutes: Simonsen, Lawrence, Beattie, Kitson, Pugh, Collins, Delap. Referee Mark Clattenburg. So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day? Yeah, me too. Psychic Sally: On The Road is on the Living channel at 7 as well. Roberto Mancini knows who the Stoke manager is this time, and shakes Tony Pulis's hand warmly. Fabio Capello is in the crowd. Wayne Bridge has thus, tediously, been mentioned approximately 741 times already. 1 min Stoke, in black, kick off from right to left. Etherington has indeed started on the right with Tuncay roaming from a nominal left-midfield position. 3 min A summary of the highlights so far: 4 min Ricardo Fuller has a mohawk. I'm telling you this because, well, bugger all is happening on the pitch. And it's a mohawk. 5 min Bridge skins Huth far too easily on the left, but Sorensen palms away his short-range cross at the near post with Ireland waiting to pounce. 6 min \"Your support is effing shit\" chant one set of fans to the other, safe in the knowledge that their support produce original and witty chants. 8 min Petrov's excellent, angled low cross is claimed courageously by Sorensen, who takes a hit from Wright-Phillips as a consequence. The camera cuts to Fabio Capello being talked at by City chairman Garry Cook. GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Stoke (Wright-Phillips 11) A complete farce of a goal. Wright-Phillips ran beyond the defence onto a long, straight pass from Ireland and lobbed it over the advancing Sorensen. It wasn't going in, but Shawcross had run beyond his own goalkeeper and got to the loose ball before Wright-Phillips. With hilarious consequences. First he sliced at fresh air as he went to ground; then, as the ball was about to go out for a goalkick, it bounced off the head of Shawcross. as he slid off the pitch in a horizontal position. That sent it back out to Wright-Phillips, who tapped it into the empty net from approximately 1.47 yards. Part misfortune + part ineptitude = total shambles. They really should have soundtracked that to the theme from Curb. 13 min A bit of a chance for Fuller. After he played a headed one-two with Sidibe, Bridge headed the ball dangerously back across his own area and Fuller slashed an awkward right-footed volley miles over the top from 15 yards. 14 min This is a big blow for Stoke: Matthew Etherington has been replaced by Liam Lawrence. It was nothing more than a slip by the touchline, but it had the look of a ligament injury and he is being stretchered around the perimeter of the field. That doesn't look good at all. 15 min \"Was that haircut what Ricardo Fuller was arrested for recently?\" says David Wall. \"I take it they're going to press charges.\" 17 min The Stoke medical staff think Etherington has done a medial ligament, although it is not confirmed. That is sad news indeed, and the replays reinforce that fear. As he slipped off the field his right knee turned really awkwardly. 18 min \"For a minute there I thought that Pulis was trying to employ some tactics,\" says H\u00f6r\u00f0ur M\u00e1r Gestsson. \"Three strikers? Fear not, it is still the old dependable 442 and lump it long to the tall guy, and failing that, lump it even longer to the even taller guy.\" 21 min Wright-Phillips long angled cross from the left towards Adebayor is headed behind by Wilkinson. It's swept in by Petrov and bounces through everyone eight yards from goal. City are comfortable without being entirely dominant. 22 min Jim Beglin on ITV reckons Wright-Phillips was offside for the goal. Now, look, most of the time I can't see beyond my own nose, but I am entirely certain that he was comfortably onside for that goal. It's not a bloody David Lynch film! 25 min I wonder what Jacob Steinberg, the Guardian's resident Stoke fan, has made of this so far. They haven't been good, it has to be said. You can see what the only teams they have beaten away from home in the last two seasons are West Brom, Hull, Cheltenham, Leyton Orient and Tottenham. 28 min Barry is justly penalised for a foul on Fuller on the left wing. Pretty brainless given Stoke's dependence on set pieces. It's about 30 yards out, wide on the left. Lawrence swings it in and Fuller's looping header from 15 yards goes well over the bar. This is rubbish. 30 min A big chance for Stoke. Tuncay got in down the left after Zabaleta brainlessly tried to intercept a square pass he was never going to get to, and then he floated a fine ball beyond the far post towards the unmarked Lawrence. He lashed his volley into the ground from eight yards, but it flew off Bridge for a corner. I'm not sure whether Given would have saved it or not; either way it was a fine, if inadvertent, block. From the corner, the 7ft 4ins Robert Huth's momentum takes him into 7ft 3ins Mama Sidibe, who collapses in the net and needs treatment as a result. Huth and Sidibe? I could take them. 34 min Sidibe is fine now and Stoke are having their best spell. This, admittedly, is not saying much. It's hardly saying anything, in fact. I just wanted to write something in an attempt to justify my existence for the next minute or so. 35 min Wilkinson is warned for a cynical tug on Wright-Phillips, who had curved infield and away from him after receiving an excellent crossfield pass from the left-back who, if ITV's commentary is anything to go by, we must apparently patronise by praising him every time he does something remotely effective, like putting one foot in front of the next and repeating the motion. 37 min Wayne Bridge runs five yards bravely, heroically, courageously. 39 min I thought Wilkinson was booked a minute or two ago but apparently not, because he's just been booked for another cynical foul on Wright-Phillips right on the line of the penalty area, a few yards from the touchline. Petrov smacks the free-kick irresponsibly high and wide. Wright-Phillips has the beating of Wilkinson here. 40 min \"BUSTY MILF\" shouts Joyce, the only email I've received in the last 20 minutes. Poor me. 41 min A long throw from Higginbotham bounces towards the near post and bounces this far over Lawrence's outstretched leg before Given claims it. 42 min Smart management from Tony Pulis, who has moved his defence around so that Wilkinson does not have to face Wright-Phillips. He is now at right-back, with Huth and Shawcross in the centre and Higginbotham at left-back. 43 min Where did that come from? When the ball is helped clear by Barry, Higginbotham runs onto it, flips it up and then cuts across a booming left-footed volley from 35 yards that swerves away from Given's dive and just wide of the left post. That was an outrageously good effort. 44 min Lawrence has gone down in a heap. There was no contact but he looks in real pain with his right knee. Absurdly, he is booed. Well done lads! He can't put any weight on his right leg and I'd be surprised if he returns. 45 min Lawrence comes back on, but his first contact is his last. He is dispossessed on the touchline, collapses in a heap again and waves the white flag to the bench. So here comes Rory Delap. 45+1 min Delap replaces Lawrence. You can just about pick up a comically funky Man City fan on the mic, who is raging against everything from Lawrence's injury to the decline of pop music to the fact that City aren't 14-0 up. Approximately every seventh word is a clean one. 45+2 min \"I contribute a mail to the mail deprived Rob Smyth's MBM updates,\" says Jose in India, my very own good samaritan. Half time: Manchester City 1-0 Stoke City What a funny half. Funny how? Well Manchester City looked so superior for the first 20 minutes or so, but they got lazy and absent-minded after the goal and that allowed Stoke to come back into a bitty half that was interrupted by bad knee injuries to two Stoke right-wingers, Etherington and Lawrence. After half an hour I thought Stoke didn't have a prayer, but this has a whiff of 1-1 about it now. See you in 10 minutes. Half-time emails \"Having been on a run of great coming-of-age novels, and seeing as today's MBM readers are clearly the educated-but-quiet types, can we have a riff based around this? I have recently read Bukowski's Ham on Rye, Fante's Wait til Spring, Bandini, and am currently enjoying Roth's Indignation (his own little variation on Catcher in the Rye themes). Any other suggestions would be welcome as I am off to the bookshop tomorrow and would like to cut my time spent reading blurbs and first pages. Dostoyevsky is banned as the mere spelling of his name makes my brain hurt, and Dickens too as I have tried and failed to read David Copperfield on three occassions much to my own embarrassment. This will be the most boring riff of all time\" - Ben Dunn. \"I'm actually watching the rugby as the FA Cup is dead to me after Saints' capitulation today. Still, not exactly living the highlife is it, on a Saturday evening? Watching the 6 Nations and wondering whether or not to go to Sainsburys post the final whistle. Really making the most of living in London that eh?\" - Rachel Clifton. \"I'm off to Dalston's avant-garde hipster hang out Cafe Oto later, to see jazzer Matthew Shipp play with a gig with Spiritualized's Jason Pierce. The blurbguff about the gig on Cafe Oto's site says that Shipp will be performing alongside some musicians with whom he's never played before. On the evidence of this match, are we convinced that Stoke attackers have ever played together before?\" - Adrian Cooper. \"Busty Milf? Ulysses has been on my shelf for a while now. I might have made more effort if I'd heard that quote before\" - Rufus Peel. 46 min City kick off from right to left. \"As a City supporter, my gf is completely at a loss to explain why Mancini's City at home always annihilate the opposition for the first twenty minutes of each half before drifting into a game of keep-ball that they are patently unfit for,\" says Scott W. \"Is this catanaccio for the Premiership or is it the psychology of the players or wot? Anyway - you're the expert. Do let us know what you think.\" As soon as I have a thought worthy of the name, I'll let you know. 47 min City have started with Wright-Philips on the left, in an attempt to torment Wilkinson. Wilkinson hasn't yet run back to left-back screaming that he wants his mummy. 48 min Wright-Phillips zig-zags past Wilkinson before Delap makes a dangerous, off-balance and just about effective challenge in the area. 49 min I don't really understand why Stoke haven't changed their defence around again to cover for Wright-Phillips moving to the left. I suppose that game of cat and mouse could get particularly tedious. Meantime, Barry screws a hopeless shot into the side-netting at the near post from a tightish angle. 51 min \"I can heartily and confidently recommend to Ben Dunn anything by former Big Paper writer Dave Eggers,\" says Niall Harden, \"especially You Shall Know Our Velocity and A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (yes, I know, but it is).\" I'm hopelessly out of my element here. Hang on, has anyone read The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure! (That's their exclamation mark, not mine.) 53 min Manchester City are having a very good spell, and Barry gets a free-kick wide on the left. It's swung in by that vision of shaved-headed loveliness, Stephen Ireland, and Sorensen claims. 55 min Stoke make their final substitution: Andy Wilkinson goes off with twisted blood (and a knee injury) to be replaced by Danny Collins. So now the back four, from right to left, is Huth-Shawcross-Higginbotham-Collins. GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Stoke City (Fuller 57) Can you guess how this goal was created? It was a delicious 16-pass move booming throw from Delap on the right, straight onto the head of the unmolested Fuller six yards out, and he planted his header to the left of Given and into the corner. That was a ridiculous throw from Delap. I don't know what sport he's playing, but I do know he's extremely good at it. 58 min Fuller so nearly gets in again. Sidibe flicked on a long kick from Sorensen and Zabaleta, having stupidly allowed the ball to bounce, just managed to baulk Fuller and let the ball run through to Given. Fuller was very close to getting a foot on it, though, and had he done so it would probably have been a goal because Given was in no-man's-land. 60 min \"I suppose it's all a matter of taste, but I really can't stand Dave Eggers,\" says Nick Wiltsher. \"And neither of the books mentioned are really coming-of-age stuff (wasn't that the point?). Your original correspondent might want to try Frank O'Connor's 'My Oedipus Complex and Other Stories', though. I'm in Miami, it's half one in the afternoon, and I'm writing pseudo-literary emails as a contribution to a report about a dour, dire game. What's wrong with this picture?\" 61 min City look a bit rudderless. Adebayor runs the ball straight into touch. I reckon it's time to introduce the experience and calmness of Vieira. 62 min \"Don't worry, Rob, you're not the only literary luddite here,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"I'm currently reading the Zombie Survival Guide. For the second time.\" 63 min Manchester City do make a change, but it's Roque Santa Cruz for the limping Martin Petrov, who didn't have much of a game by his kite-high standards. 64 min Bridge kicks the ball out to allow Sidibe to get treatment. That's a worry for Stoke, who have made all three substitutions. He was kicked by Toure, but I think he'll be okay. Bridge gets a volley for that foaming, cussing nugget in the crowd, who really is in a hot one. 65 min \"Coming-of-Age novels is it?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Ben Dunn could go hi-tech and watch Channel Four's very good 'Inbetweeners' on their i-player. Or he could try the Collected OBOs of Rob Smyth 2004-2009 via a lot of fiddly googling.\" Arf. That would be more of a going-of-age novel. 66 min Sidibe is back on. I don't know if Toure kicked him deliberately or not, as they haven't shown a replay. 67 min Wright-Phillips miscontrols a pass from Barry into touch. City are all over the place just now. 68 min Now Fuller is down after a clash of heads with Toure, who is killing off Stoke's strikers one by one. 69 min \"Ben should try to get hold of David Wroblewski's The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,\" says David Wall. \"It's based on a classic and is destined to become a classic itself, so he'll get the high-brow cache of something like Dickens. And as well as learning important, coming-of-age, lessons about life, hee might also learn something about dog-handling.\" 70 min Manchester City win a corner on the right. After much faffing from both sides, it eventually yields another corner on the left. This one is taken by Bridge, and it's headed clear by Collins. The last 10 minutes have been woeful, although it's very difficult not to admire Stoke's spirit and work-rate. 72 min \"Dave Eggers is overrated-try The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides,\" says Phil Rebbeck. \"Coming-of-age novel par excellence.\" I saw that one at the cinema! 73 min Patrick Vieira comes on, but for Stephen Ireland. That means City have three defensive-minded midfield players. 74 min An enterprising free-kick from Stoke. With all the big men in the box, Tuncay instead screwed the ball back from the right for Whelan, and he took a touch before thrashing it towards goal from 30 yards. It was beautifully struck but straight at Given, who patted it down with both hands and claimed at the second attempt. 75 min Adebayor, off balance and on the turn, shanks a half-volley over the top from the edge of the area. 76 min CIty are playing a 4-4-2 now, with Barry and Wright-Phillips wide and Santa Cruz and Adebayor up front. 77 min A replay is no good to either side really, and the game is starting to stretch a little. Whelan tries to lob Given from 50 yards. Doesn't. 79 min Thomas Sorensen makes a brilliant save. When a corner was cleared it was fed back to Wright-Phillips on the right, and his early near-post cross was flicked towards goal by the head of Barry. It was going in the top corner but Sorensen leapt to tip it over spectacularly with his left hand. The save perhaps looked slightly better than it was, such was the showy nature of Sorensen's leap, but it was still high-class stuff. 81 min Wright-Phillips spanks a shot into the side netting at the near post. Had that gone in there would have been some fun and games, because the move started with Vieira throwing Delap to the floor. 82 min \"For a look at the sometimes brilliant and sometimes downright savage behaviour of journalists,\" says Monty, \"you could always try Thompson's The Rum Diary.\" 83 min The attendance is only around 28,000, nearly 20,000 shy of capacity. It's just like watching Mansfield! 85 min Zabaleta passes the ball straight into touch. I've no idea why but, with the exception of the excellent Wright-Phillips, Manchester City have been really woeful today, a \u00a3150m pub team. 86 min \"Do you think Mark Hughes could be tempted back?\" says David Wall. 88 min Delap lines up another throw-in and then dummies, going short before getitng the return and drilling in a cross that Vieira clears. 89 min A moronic foul from De Jong, who tugs Diao's shirt 40 yards from goal. It's in line with the right side of the box, so Stoke send all the big boys forward. It's taken by Tuncay and headed tamely wide by Sidibe. 90 min There will be four minutes of added misery. 90+1 min Sometimes you sense a goal is coming in added time. Today you don't sense a successful pass is coming, never mind a goal. 90+2 min Santa Cruz's shot is cleared off the line by Shawcross. Actually it was going wide. Santa Cruz ran onto to a classy clipped pass from Vieira on the right, and chested it down before dragging his volley across Sorensen and towards the far corner. It would have gone wide anyway but Shawcross didn't know that and his block went straight into the hands of Sorensen. 90+4 min Tuncay, running onto a good pass from Whelan, tries to shoot from a preposterous angle and blasts it wide of the near post. In his defence he had no support at all. Full time: Manchester City 1-1 Stoke City Well played Stoke. A few might say they are an affront to football but what they certainly are is a testament to the human spirit. They were totally outclassed for the first 20 minutes but they slowly broke the will of a surprisingly flimsy Manchester City side and fully deserved their equaliser. You'd probably make them slight favourites for the replay now. Thanks for your emails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
