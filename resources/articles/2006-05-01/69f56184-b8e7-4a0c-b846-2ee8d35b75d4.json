Prices of gas, electricity and other fuels were 20.5% higher in the year to April, but the increases were mostly offset by cheaper meals out and bargain offers for household goods. Prices in April rose by 0.6% - the fastest increase for five years, compared with 0.4% for the same month a year ago. As a result the annual inflation rate climbed from 1.8% to the government's 2% target. Transport prices also played a role. Airfare inflation leapt to 13.1% from -10.2% owing to a later Easter this year, adding 0.16% to the inflation rate. Excluding movements in erratic components such as energy, transport and food, core inflation remained low at 1.3%, suggesting strong competition in the retail sector was holding prices down. \"It is encouraging that after such large increases in gas, electricity and petrol prices that the headline rate is only at its target,\" said Geoffrey Dicks, economist at RBS. \"The headline rate may edge higher in the coming months as higher energy prices continue to feed through.\" Michael Saunders, analyst at Citigroup, said the headline rate would eventually drop below the target as rises in energy prices started to fade early next year. Economists believe subdued earnings growth, rising imports from low-cost countries and increasing unemployment would help keep inflation below target next year. Mr Saunders said low inflation would allow for a longer period of stable interest rates than currently projected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
