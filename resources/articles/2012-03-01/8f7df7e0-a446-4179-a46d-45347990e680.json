Roberto Di Matteo goes it alone at Chelsea", "bodyText": "Life as Chelsea manager may have appeared a lonely existence for recent incumbents charged with overseeing a dressing room so prone to cliques and divisions. But the interim coach, Roberto Di Matteo, has offered evidence as to why he may just be suited to the role and impervious to any such political murmurings by suggesting he does not make, or indeed have, friends either in football or away from the game. The Italian offered a decidedly stark, if somewhat surreal, outlook as he addressed Saturday's visit of Stoke City to Stamford Bridge in what will be his first Premier League match in temporary charge since the sacking of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas last weekend. Di Matteo had been a senior player at the club while the likes of John Terry progressed into the first-team set-up before seeing his own career ended by a triple fracture of his leg, eventually returning as first-team coach last summer to work under the Portuguese. In that context of familiarity, he was asked whether his relationship with the playing personnel might be made awkward now that, having progressed from player to coach, he has adopted managerial duties until the end of the season. \"I think 'friends' is a big word,\" said Di Matteo. \"I'm not sure how many friends you have, but I don't have any, actually. If people come up to me and say: 'I met a friend of yours the other day,' I know they're liars. I don't have any friends. That's my outlook on life. I'm 41 and I've had a few experiences in life.\" While that hinted at a tongue in cheek response, asked whether he had not received support from friends upon breaking his leg so horrifically in a Uefa Cup tie at St Gallen back in September 2000, he added: \"That was a bad period for me, but a good learning period to understand how relationships work between people. It worked well because I understood a lot of things. I'm just being realistic. It does take a lot to become my friend, yes. But it's not football that's made me that way. It's life experiences that have done that.\" Di Matteo later rather contradicted himself by admitting Villas-Boas would remain \"a friend for life\", but the sense that he does not wish to be associated with any perceived cabals within the dressing room was clear. The interim coach has taken time to speak face to face with every member of the squad this week to offer a reminder of the gravity of Chelsea's situation, cast as they are some three points adrift of the top four, and insisted he considers all to be \"onside\" despite the ructions of the last few weeks. Raul Meireles's surly reaction to scoring at Birmingham in midweek, the midfielder later departing the pitch abruptly on the final whistle, had suggested those players who had been closer to Villas-Boas have been left disaffected by the manager's dismissal just eight months into a three-year contract. \"Meireles is a great character with fantastic personality,\" said Di Matteo. \"He's a very reliable team member of this team. We are all human beings. We're not going to change people's emotional reactions. They have to express themselves.\" The stand-in manager will continue to show faith in Fernando Torres, despite the Spain international now having almost gone 24 hours of playing time without a goal. The \u00a350m forward, who last registered in the Premier League in September, boasts five goals in 50 appearances for the club and opted against taking a penalty he had won at St Andrew's. \"I will persevere (with him) as long as it takes,\" said Di Matteo. \"Persevere, persevere. He's a team player and, when you work hard in life on a football pitch, it will come. I have total confidence in him and (will wait) as long as it takes. \"I have always, paradoxically to what I've seen, had a good relationship with my players [during spells as manager at MK Dons and West Bromwich Albion] and that's the case here as well. We talk. That's how it is. We exchange opinions and, eventually, I make my own decisions. But we do speak and I listen to what they think. Ultimately, though, it's my responsibility to pick the players and the tactics for every game. This team is full of leaders. We have to work together to achieve what we want to achieve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
