Vardy\u2019s 60th-minute strike in Tuesday\u2019s 2-0 victory left Simon Mignolet, the Liverpool goalkeeper, no chance of stopping it as the 29-year-old hit a first-time shot on the angle from 25 yards. Vardy also scored Leicester\u2019s second to take him to 18 goals in the Premier League, making him the competition\u2019s highest scorer this season. Leicester lead City by three points and Hart believes Vardy will pose a real threat. Hart said of the volley against Liverpool: \u201cIt\u2019s a great goal and fully meant. That goal ultimately won Leicester the game. Their first of the game and it was a fantastic finish. We study the team we\u2019re playing against and I watch football as a fan. I know how he scores his goals and his pattern of finishing but there\u2019s only so much you can plan for a Saturday because I doubt anyone would have seen that goal coming. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for how the season has gone for him. He\u2019s a fantastic player and a great guy. He\u2019s really exploded. I think he\u2019s just been more prolific. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s changed about him. Obviously, I didn\u2019t know too much about him until Leicester were in the Premier League but we know what hard work and energy he brings and that he could really take up the time of the back four on his own. For me as a keeper it\u2019s about knowing how he\u2019ll chase every ball and now he\u2019s added the finishing too. It\u2019s priceless, really.\u201d Hart is familiar with Vardy as the two are England colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. I got him as soon as he walked through the door at England. I was obviously aware of him, having spoken to Kasper [Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper], and was aware, having been at England for a long time, that he didn\u2019t have any team-mates with him but he is exactly as he seems. He\u2019s straight down the line. He is who he is and he\u2019s a lot of fun to be around.\u201d Hart believes Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side will contend until the end of the season. \u201cThey more than deserve to be where they are at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they keep that up they\u2019re obviously going to be there or thereabouts. After the game on Saturday they\u2019re done for us this season and then it\u2019s all about what we do. Beating them is a statement that would only last until the following week when different statements are made.\u201d Hart believes an unprecedented quadruple of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup remains possible. \u201cThe squad is going to be stretched if we\u2019re going to achieve but what\u2019s the point otherwise?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to dig in and get the bodies out when we can. We\u2019re in a good moment and are going to have to keep going and cash in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
