In his soon-to-be published biography, Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry, the journalist Owen Bennett writes that the then justice secretary was asked if he had ever taken drugs. \u201cYes, cocaine,\u201d he replied, according to someone described as having \u201cintimate knowledge of the event\u201d. According to Bennett: \u201cHe was firmly instructed not to give that answer in public, and told instead to fall back on the words [David] Cameron had used when he was running for leader, namely that politicians are entitled to a private life before entering politics.\u201d As the Daily Mail prepared to publish that anecdote in an extract of Bennett\u2019s book on Saturday, the environment secretary was forced to come clean. \u201cThe book is correct,\u201d Gove said. \u201cI did take drugs. It is something I deeply regret. Drugs damage lives. They are dangerous and it was a mistake. \u201cObviously it will be for my colleagues in parliament and members of the Conservative party to decide now if I should be leader. I think all politicians have lives before politics. Certainly, when I was working as a journalist, I didn\u2019t imagine I would go into politics or public service. I didn\u2019t act with an eye to that.\u201d The story quickly made it to the second edition front pages of Saturday\u2019s Daily Telegraph, the Sun, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express, and its position at the top of the news agenda was established. The revelations have provoked criticism from across the political spectrum, with the former senior drug adviser to the government Prof David Nutt telling the Observer that Gove\u2019s disclosure was more proof that privileged politicians felt able \u201cto break the law, but not for others to do the same\u201d. Craig Oliver, who was the former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the admission could become an issue that overshadowed Gove\u2019s leadership campaign messages, as the Tory rank and file were very socially conservative. The following day, the Mail on Sunday reported claims that in 1999 Gove had written a column urging tougher action against cocaine use shortly before hosting a party at his Mayfair flat where guests were openly taking the drug. Gove\u2019s spokesman said he had no recollection of a party on that date. In the piece, headlined \u201cWhen it\u2019s right to be a hypocrite\u201d, Gove wrote that he did not agree with \u201cLondon\u2019s liberal consensus\u201d on loosening rules on the use of cocaine and other drugs. \u201cThe knowledge that millennial demand for illegal drugs may lead to the potentially lethal adulteration of some substances hasn\u2019t been used to explain to citizens that the law is there for a purpose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead it\u2019s been acknowledged that some people feel they have to see in the new millennium in an altered state, so we\u2019ve been given advice on how to \u2018minimise\u2019 risk.\u201d Despite the hostile headlines, Gove did not shy away from an appearance on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, but that quickly turned into a grilling about whether he had ever lied on any official forms about his past drug use. The environment secretary looked rattled and uncomfortable under tough lines of questioning about whether he should have gone to prison for taking Class A drugs and if it was right for teachers to have been banned from their profession for similar conduct. The mood among the other leadership campaigns was one of excitement that the second place in the contest looked wide open, with the teams of Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock all feeling they were in with a chance again to take on the likely frontrunner, Boris Johnson. However, there was also nervousness about the level of skulduggery going on behind the scenes, as many of the advisers on the various campaigns have worked together closely in the past and have the potential to know a multitude of political secrets that might harm their rivals. The \u201cclean campaign\u201d pledge signed by some of the candidates may yet be overtaken by events. The best guess of Gove supporters was that someone working for a rival might have spoken to Bennett about Gove\u2019s initial confession in 2015. The Mail on Sunday ran reports that Gove supporters suspected Beth Armstrong, an aide to Dominic Raab who used to work for Gove, of having leaked the information. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take Sherlock to work out how this got out,\u201d one insider told the paper. Raab\u2019s team said: \u201cThis did not come from anyone involved in the Raab campaign. We would never look to score cheap political points like this. We have nothing but admiration for Michael Gove and all he has achieved as a minister.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
