Sammy McIlroy's men have now collected only four points from five matches, and the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark are contesting the top two places. The manager was scathing in his criticism of his back division, accusing them of \"schoolboy errors\" and claiming that all four goals should have been prevented. \"When you give away a penalty like we did in the opening minutes there is always an uphill struggle,\" he said. Northern Ireland repeatedly put themselves under pressure with misplaced passes and sloppy clearances during an error-ridden first half and found it difficult coping with the pace and interchanges of the Bulgarian forwards. Yet again they conceded an early goal when the midfielder Jim Magilton made a bad back-pass and the Preston centre-back Colin Murdock brought down Bulgaria's centre-forward Krassimir Balakov, who scored from the spot. After a 15th-minute reply from Mark Williams, who rose above three defenders to head in a corner from Michael Hughes, another defensive blunder two minutes later let in Martin Petrov, who dribbled past Danny Griffin, stumbled, but still managed to get the ball past the keeper Roy Carroll from an acute angle. Northern Ireland looked a much more confident and committed unit after the interval, until Carroll let a 40-yard free-kick from Krasmir Tchomakov spin through his hands into the net after 72 minutes. Four minutes later Petrov struck again with a half-volley at the far post, but the match then took another bizarre turn as the Irish contrived a barnstorming finish. Hughes attempted a shot which ballooned in the air and dropped for Stuart Elliott to beat the Bulgarian keeper with a looping header. Then, in the first minute of injury-time, Biser Ivanov brought down David Healy in the box and the diminutive Preston striker scored from the spot. That brought his international goal tally to six in 10 games and put him, at age 21, in line to break Northern Ireland's 13-goal record held by Colin Clarke, the former Portsmouth centre- forward. Bulgaria (4-3-1-2): Zdravkov; Kichichev, Pazain, Markov, Petkov (Stoilov, 58min); B Ivanov, Tchomakov, Hristrov (S Petrov, 67); Balakov; Berbatov, M Petrov. Northern Ireland (4-4-1-1): Carroll (Wigan); Griffin (Dundee Utd), Williams (Wimbledon), Murdock (Preston), Nolan (Bradford; McCarthy , Birmingham, 90); Gillespie (Blackburn; Johnson , Blackburn, 86), Magilton (Ipswich), Lennon (Celtic; Kennedy , Watford, 86), Elliott (Motherwell); Hughes (Wimbledon), Healy (Preston).
