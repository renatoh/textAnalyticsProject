Up to a point, the answer must be yes. When Mr Blair unveiled plans last June to lease a second-hand Boeing 737 for VIP travel the media dubbed it Blair Force One - though even then the timetable made clear that it would probably fly as Brown Airways. It was an example of nobly taking the flak for a necessary, but unpopular, decision. Mr Blair's rush to relaunch the British nuclear power programme fits that template, as does his arguably premature decision to start the Trident submarine renewal process and get a Commons vote behind it. Mr Brown endorsed both, but Mr Blair has taken the hit. Some policies are Brown-driven behind the scenes - a bigger role for pharmacies, for instance, and clearer rules that allow teachers to enforce classroom discipline. So a whole raft of policies now coming out of government is agreed between nos 10 and 11 Downing Street, all part of the ongoing process of reform. Thus a draft road-pricing bill was unveiled by Douglas Alexander, while post office closures and a controversial energy white paper came courtesy of Alistair Darling, both Brownites. John Reid, the Blairite home secretary, had Mr Brown's support in splitting the Home Office into a Ministry of Justice. It was hastily done and alarmed the judges, who may fear their budgets and productivity - as varied as that of heart surgeons - will come under more exacting scrutiny. Mr Brown backs Mr Reid's call yesterday for a review of the control order policy, but not if it means getting concessions in Europe for which the EU will later want trade-offs. So not all of Mr Blair's current activity is welcome to Mr Brown, though he is not going to get cross about it now; like an old married couple the pair are past their \"TB/GB\" fights and No 11 can put up with Mr Blair's flurry of policy reviews in recent months. \"No one's listening now,\" says a Blairite minister. But as with Mr Blair's famous NHS spending announcement on David Frost's BBC sofa in 2000 - \"You've stolen my budget!\" raged Mr Brown - GB allies fear that TB will pinch some initiatives they are holding back for after June 27. Populist ones, of course. No 11 seems confident that No 10 will not annoy the xenophobic tabloids by conceding much at the EU summit on June 21-22, Mr Blair's final week. That would be unpopulist. But No 10 can afford to relax on spending commitments, knowing the Brown government will pick up the bill. Mr Blair wants to go out \"tough on crime\" and has told the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, both run by demob-happy Blairites, to press ahead with persistent offender orders which would recall prisoners who reoffend. That could be both expensive and embarrassing, but prime minister Brown could hardly revoke the order on day one, dampening what yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll suggested may be Labour's recovery against the Tories. Blair's offer to match donations by graduates to their old university is another ticking timebomb that jars Treasury nerves. Even the Lugovoi extradition row could prove a polonium-210 poisoned chalice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
