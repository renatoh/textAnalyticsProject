Are you ready, England? The other problem for the USA -- after all that, now they face a team that was simply dominant in its quarterfinal match. But let\u2019s say this about the USA ... Last time around, Julie Ertz got all the praise while linemate Becky Sauerbrunn was criminally overlooked. This time, Ertz is simply locking down the middle of the field, so much so that Jill Ellis can have the confidence not to play Lindsey Horan. (Not that the Horan benching was a good idea.) You simply cannot sleep on Tobin Heath on the right flank. Imagine if she had as many chances as Rapinoe has had. She might have hat tricks of goals and assists by now. And give credit to Megan Rapinoe. She\u2019s a lightning rod for controversy, by choice. She might lose five straight 1v1 battles and then kill an opponent on the sixth. She made her name as one of the best crossers of the ball (think of her long floated ball to Abby Wambach at the death against Brazil) and has just added to her game since then. She takes fantastic set pieces. Sure, Bouhaddi should\u2019ve done better with the first one, but that was a drive that puts a lot of pressure on a defense. They\u2019re vulnerable. Sure. And if they can run the table here -- beating France, England and then probably Germany -- that\u2019ll be one of the most impressive World Cup runs ever. Even if we\u2019ll still be asking when the defense will be tested. Thanks for all the comments. Hope you enjoyed it, and maybe we\u2019ll get an epic in the semifinals. The questions that remain ... Alyssa Naeher has faced three difficult shots on goal, and two went into the net. Crystal Dunn has been overmatched at left back for the last two games. Kelley O\u2019Hara was playing with fire for the whole game today. Alex Morgan, as many commenters are noting, has been ineffective since drubbing Thailand. Maybe should\u2019ve saved some goals from that game for the future games. And the commenters aren\u2019t happy with coach Jill Ellis ... Rick McGahey: \u201cJill Ellis is the new Maurizio Sarri. Make the same substitution regardless of the actual game situation. Lloyd?\u201d Michael Wilcox on Alex Morgan: \u201cI know she\u2019s the star of the team and everything, but the fact that Ellis won\u2019t substitute her under any circumstances short of crippling injury is also ridiculous.\u201d He continues: \u201cMewis for Lloyd is the dumbest substitution I\u2019ve ever seen. Hope Solo was right, the team wins in spite of Ellis. I play Football Manager and I feel confident I understand positions and roles better than Jill Ellis.\u201d Ironically, given the presence of a commenter from Cork, I was fired in Football Manager by ... Cork City. In her defense ... jay: \u201cjill ellis specifically said that france doesn\u2019t want the ball, so the us will let france have the ball. thus, the us will give up possession and play 5 at the back. and france only scored (just now) on a set piece, not really because of the 5 at the back.\u201d what do people have against capital letters? Your comments: George Meikle: \u201cSeems like USWNT do well with offsides discipline, while France did not do well and was caught many times.\u201d Simon McMahon: \u201cBonsoir Beau. Genuine question, but have they changed the rules during the tournament? The penalty awarded against Scotland in their opening game against England was about 1000% less of a spot kick than the one just not given for France.\u201d Maybe the call in that opening game wasn\u2019t very good? Chris in Cork, where I visited in my honeymoon in 1999 but bypassed on my trip to Ireland this spring, also thinks it was a penalty. What are they saying elsewhere? The US commentators aren\u2019t saying anything. The USA had possession less than 40% of the time. They were outshot 20-10. Their outside backs looked vulnerable. The offense sputtered. And they\u2019ve just beaten the home team, considered to be their toughest opponent in this Cup. 90 min +5: French throw-in, and they can\u2019t find anyone open. This looks like one of the U11 games I ref, where the player simply doesn\u2019t want to throw it away. They throw it away anyway, and now Morgan is in the corner getting away with a push and winning a throw-in. 90 min +4: Oh my. Mbock dispossesses Heath, who catches her and ... it certainly seemed that she slid through the French player\u2019s legs. No call. Going the other way, Bussaglia more obviously fouls Morgan and sees yellow. 90 min +3: Press has been impressive in her brief stint, winning a throw-in to help kill the game. France regain possession. What can they do? 90 min +2: This is a very patient French buildup leading to a telegraphed pass that Dunn easily picks off and plays forward to no one, killing 30 more seconds. 90 min +1: We\u2019ll play five more. Press smartly wins the ball and plays back to O\u2019Hara, who smartly goes to the corner and smartly dives. Ref isn\u2019t interested, but the defender plays the ball off her ankle. Now we have a Heath dribbling exhibition, which I\u2019d pay to watch. 89 min: The French attack is just too tentative. Thiney takes too many touches and finally plays forward just in time for a correct offside call. Some people in the inbox says France have made too many bad decisions going forward. They have, but the US defenders have forced some of those. And then falling behind 0-1 early on was immense. 88 min: When we have a long stoppage, I\u2019ll get to the inbox. Dunn draws a foul at midfield. 87 min: Crystal Dunn, who\u2019s about 5 foot negative 1, is one of two players in the wall. Better than being in the box, where Henry appears to try to score a Maradona-style goal with her hand. Christen Press enters the game for Rapinoe, who was in the right place at the right time multiple times. (RIP Dr. John.) 85 min: France move forward. Ball played off O\u2019Hara. France wants a penalty. None given. Would\u2019ve been harsh, but we\u2019ve seen worse. Back down the field, and France earn another free kick anyway. Renard lurks ... 84 min: The corner kick floats to Henry, who\u2019s triple-teamed and is still called for a foul. OK. Dunn wins the ball and gives it away. She wins it again and blasts it forward, where Rapinoe loses it. 83 min: France goes back to working on Dunn, and they win another corner. Renard steps forward with a fierce look. 82 min: Substitution -- and I warned you. Carli Lloyd, a superb clutch scorer who never was very good at possessing the ball and is not young any more, is into the game in place of Sam Mewis. This makes no sense. None. Whatsoever. And it\u2019ll probably work out anyway. A poor foul from O\u2019Hara, a free kick floated into the box, a US defender (Mewis?) holding people onside, and Renard easily deposits the header into the box. And then Le Sommer comes out, with Asseyi coming in. Sure, let\u2019s be controversial ... Ruth Purdue: \u201cWho wants to ask Hope Solo why the best team in the world is playing 5 at the back and refusing to come out?\u201d Well, she\u2019s writing for The Guardian. What say you, editors? 79 min: A real save from Naeher! Le Sommer gets a boot on the ball in the box against O\u2019Hara, and Naeher has to leap to punch the lob over the bar. The corner kick goes nowhere. 78 min: Free kick to France. Majri plays ahead of the line of players in the box. No French players run forward onto it. Naeher catches. The ball eventually gets to Henry on an O\u2019Hara giveaway, and the French attacker blasts a 20-yard shot, again straight at Naeher. 76 min: Oh come on. That was beautiful, even it was North Carolina grad to North Carolina grad. (I went to Duke.) Crystal Dunn -- again, a better attacker than defender -- races down the left and crosses back to Heath. The flag goes up. We have some sort of VAR intervention, and apparently one fiber of Dunn\u2019s boot was offside. Cascarino has come on for France, and Sauerbrunn welcomes her to the game with a leg sweep. Ouch. 75 min: Nothing\u2019s happening. George Meikle points to a difference between the USA and a Mourinho team: \u201cBig diff being USA WOMEN want to play their hearts gutz out for each other, coach, maybe us(?).\u201d Yes, I see everyone on Twitter and in the mailbox gloating about Rapinoe and a possible invitation to some address about 15 miles east of me. I know, I know. Take it to the politics section. Or tweet away. 73 min: Foul by Morgan, and we need to ask what subs to make. Probably another defensive-minded substitution, maybe Tierna Davidson for Dunn. But Jill Ellis will probably come up with some reason to bring on Carli Lloyd. 71 min: Replay shows Henry jumped on Horan\u2019s back and managed to hurt herself banging into Horan\u2019s head. Clever tweet: And here\u2019s that goal: Maybe France should consider marking Rapinoe next time. Just can\u2019t give her easy chances. 69 min: And just when I say Rapinoe hasn\u2019t been effective despite scoring twice, she races forward and forces a recovery run from Diani. She\u2019s been pretty good today, but it\u2019s going to be frustrating when she\u2019s named player of the match ahead of, say, Julie Ertz. I\u2019m almost speaking too soon, as a French cross finds Gauvin, but the header is wide and she was offside, anyway. The five US defenders are playing a good line here. 67 min: And I was about to post this from Raymond Smith ... \u201cThese defensive, look-for-the-breakaway tactics are Jose (Mourinho) tactics. It didn\u2019t work for United, and I\u2019ll bet it won\u2019t work for the USA either!\u201d Yes, but Mourinho already used up all the good luck he\u2019ll ever have in his career. The U.S. players have not. Somehow. To be fair, they\u2019ve also been very, very good. France didn\u2019t suddenly forget how to play. I want to see VAR. Really seemed like Heath was offside. But she does the hard work, crosses, deflects, and Rapinoe has inexplicably scored four goals in two games without being particularly effective. Replay shows Heath was on. Now can I say it\u2019s over? 63 min: SUBSTITUTION. Here comes Lindsey Horan at last, replacing Lavelle. Yeah, they\u2019re parking the bus. But Gauvin wins a header between two of the three central defenders, and Naeher actually has to make a save. 62 min: Le Sommer, almost certainly offside, gets the ball on the left and crosses. Majri blasts the ball off O\u2019Hara. Did that hit her in the wrist (tucked in ahead of her torso, so no handball)? She\u2019s hurt. Tactics, tactics ... 61 min: France have 59% possession and 11 shots. None on target. We may be at a ticker-tape parade in a couple of weeks asking when someone\u2019s going to test Alyssa Naeher. 59 min: Played ahead to Diani, but if Dunn is two things, she\u2019s a potent attacker (rather wasted at left back) and a speedster, and she breaks things up. Simon Loft: \u201cCan you win a corner, or a throw-in, off a pony-tail? France were denied a corner in about the 53rd min\u201d Don\u2019t give the VAR crew any ideas. 58 min: CHANCE FOR FRANCE. It starts with Diani again beating Dunn. The ball is played back, then floated to the far post, where neither Renard nor Naeher can get to it. Le Sommer shoots but has no path to goal. 57 min: Le Sommer works on the left again against O\u2019Hara and wins a corner. Will France remember that they have Renard? They do, but it\u2019s headed clear -- maybe Ertz, maybe Dahlkemper. I need a bigger TV. That opening sequence: 54 min: And another delayed offside call. And probably incorrect, but France had regained possession anyway. It\u2019ll just be a topic of conversation with the ref assessor later. France possessing now, but maybe 80 yards from the US goal. And now 100. That won\u2019t help. 53 min: Thiney plays the corner, where Le Sommer goes up for it and heads it into the next arrondissement. She tries to claim a deflection, but it was not to be. At the other side, Heath is offside. 51 min: Le Sommer slaloms past O\u2019Hara and Dahlkemper, but it\u2019s alleged defensive midfielder (now basically a third center back) Ertz coming in to sweep it away for a throw-in. Seems unfair. At least let France have a corner. Henry gains a shot from distance, then a second, and this one is deflected for that corner. I must be ahead of the time-space continuum somehow. 50 min: Ruth Purdue: \u201cWidth is the answer for France and the way around this US team. The Americans squeeze the centre for space and France struggle to go through there. Get the full back higher and switch the play quicker. There is space in behind.\u201d On cue, O\u2019Hara fails to cope with pressure, and the ball is played into the box, where Dunn gives it away. So many holes in the US team, but can anyone punish them? Doug Burton: \u201cFrench supporters seem to be resigned to a slow death. They need to lift the team for them to have a chance. US basically came into their house and are sleeping on the couch with their shoes on, eating all their food and leaving garbage everywhere.\u201d Sounds like a disgruntled AirBnB owner. 48 min: France concede another corner under frankly minimal pressure. The ref again wants to chat with people in the box, specifically Torrent. Aly Wagner says France will want to stop Julie Ertz. They barely do so, and the USA wave hands looking for a handball. Or a foul. Actually, Crystal Dunn played it with her arm, but that\u2019s probably not what the USA meant. 46 min: CHANCE FOR USA. A 20-yard shot from Mewis forces Bouhaddi to dive and stretch. Heath is there to send in the rebound from a tough angle, and Bouhaddi saves for a corner. Morgan has a shot from the corner that\u2019s blocked by Henry, and that seemed to hurt. What\u2019s French for \u201calarm clock\u201d? I\u2019m 12 feet away from a 27-inch diagonal screen that was high-tech when we got it in 2006. Teams are back on the field. Want to look ahead? Not writing off France here, but someone from this game will face England, and Eni Aluko has some words of caution before that semifinal: England looked better yesterday than either team look here, but Aluko\u2019s warning seems fair. And one US star seems to have bounced back, which sounds odd coming back from a game in which she scored twice from the spot: \u201cWithout question, my standout of the attacking Americans is Rapinoe. Her goal may have had a touch of luck about it, but given the week she\u2019s had this is quite the show of intent to silence the critics. I\u2019ve yet to see the ball stripped from her I think,\u201d says Matthew Richman. Meanwhile, Peter Oh asks about the USA\u2019s third-string keeper: \u201cAny chance of Franch being introduced from the bench to help stanch any staunch resistance by the French?\u201d I think a branch just fell on my house. (BTW -- yes, I\u2019m part French, but I\u2019m actually more English and Scottish. And apparently American, according to my birth certificate.) Quick note: Kelley O\u2019Hara already has a yellow in this tournament. Needs to be careful. Seemed clear from the conversation that she is one step away. Jamison MacLachlan is still unhappy: \u201cFrance making adjustments. US not to much. The US can\u2019t sit and defend a 1-0 lead for another 45. It\u2019s hot, there will be a mental lapse, a bad bounce, a terrible VAR decision.\u201d So is Brian Doll: \u201cUs midfield is unbelievably sloppy with their passes not sure if they have actually completed more than five. This game needs a person to put their foot on the ball and calm things down. Game tailor made for Horan yet she is on the bench.\u201d Aren\u2019t the USA winning this one? And one more from Arlo Katts: \u201cI\u2019m getting no sense of the ebb and flow of the game from this commentary. There\u2019s no analysis, just reportage of what the US team is doing. Have France not turned up?\u201d They have not. Give credit to France for having most of the possession after a disastrous opening 10 minutes. But the USA are content to be a counterattacking team now, and France have shown little sign of breaking them down. All it takes is one set piece, though. France still have the proverbial puncher\u2019s chance. 46 min +2: The last meaningful touch of the half is a hard but untroubling blast from Rapinoe. 45 min: More French possession with little intent. Peter McMurry: \u201cI\u2019m surprised France isn\u2019t attacking more down the left flank - Majri looks the most energetic French player, but Renard keeps ignoring her in order to play the ball over to the right, despite Diani having no joy so far. I don\u2019t understand. Also, Thiney has done nothing and should be subbed off.\u201d Right on cue, Diani slips free for a header in the box that goes wide. And Dunn has not looked the part at left back through the whole tournament. She plays eight positions, probably five of them better than left back. 43 min: O\u2019Hara dives to win a foul from Gauvin at midfield. (Granted, I\u2019m watching on a small screen. Your view may differ.) The ball works out to Rapinoe, who plays back to Dunn, who is always eager to get into the attack but had better options than shooting there. First US shot in a while, but not one of interest. France have 61% possession, five shots -- not one on target. 41 min: A US player -- looks like Mewis -- somehow wins the header off the free kick away from Renard, but it\u2019s nowhere near the frame. 40 min: Off the free kick from the O\u2019Hara foul, we once again have a seminar with our ref. After the long wait, the ball floats straight to Naeher. At the other end, Bouhaddi decides she has been idle for a while, so she races off her line on a whim. That action solves nothing, and Rose Lavelle is needlessly fouled for a US free kick that Tobin Heath (remember her?) will take. 38 min: Alex Morgan lifts her studs up. Whistle blows. Morgan says she didn\u2019t touch her. She kinda did. Through ball from France is cut out by O\u2019Hara, running twice as fast as everyone else. And then O\u2019Hara slams into Majri. Literally. Not sure how she avoided yellow there. OK, it\u2019s not over. France have looked better here. 37 min: Not much possession for the USA at the moment. Ruth Purdue asks: \u201cHave they changed the rule about having to receive the ball outside the box from a goal kick?\u201d Yes, and I\u2019m not looking forward to my referee recertification test. See, I\u2019m not alone ... 33 min: The corner kick gets to Henry, but the header goes well over. France are at least putting a few things together. Still no shots on target. 32 min: Still not sure what happened with Morgan. Replay showed she might have landed badly after going up for a header, but she walks off with little trouble and immediately asks to come back in. We resume, and Diani takes the ball from Dunn and goes forward. Mewis blocks the cross for a corner. 29 min: A corner kick for France, which might be their best chance to get something going thanks to the height of Wendie Renard. The ball floats past her head, and as France try to cycle it back in, they\u2019re offside. Again. That\u2019s at least four. Alex Morgan is down, which gives us an unofficial hydration break. Not sure what\u2019s up, but the trainers are out. 28 min: Things have quieted down a bit. The USA are clearly content to press in spurts and wait for France to hand over the ball. 25 min: Not saying the USA have parked the bus, but while France play the ball around midfield, we can clearly see a line of five keeping France at bay. And it pays off with an offside call. So if you wanted Ertz to play center back today, congratulations. Now she is. Two from Mary Waltz in the inbox: \u201cSpain shut down Morgan with constant tough,not dirty, play well before the box area. With the early yellow will France be able to duplicate those tactic. French goalie just assumed a tip in on that goal.\u201d Also: \u201cDunn still looks shaky. If France focuses on her this match is far from over.\u201d But they won\u2019t. It\u2019s over. Note to emailers -- I am not going to mention the person whose name rhymes with \u201crump\u201d and is a part-time resident of Washington, DC. Sorry. 21 min: Do you know me? This is Tobin Heath. She plays right forward for the USA. She barely saw the ball against Spain but was very effective when she did. She\u2019s one of the most skilled players in US women\u2019s history. Rose Lavelle just tried to play the ball to her, but the pass was about 10 yards (9 meters) off target. 18 min: A sweet cutback from Diani to beat Dunn, and that sets up a series of near-chances. Still nothing to trouble Naeher. France\u2019s defenders play the ball around, hoping they\u2019ve weathered the storm while only conceding one goal. And Rapinoe is down in pain again. Amandine Henry, who has played in the USA, chats with the ref. The Seattle-Portland rivalry is everywhere. 16 min: I can\u2019t possibly keep up with the US attack today. Neither can Bouhaddi, who has to race out of her box to play the ball away from Rapinoe (who was offside, the replay shows, but VAR is far behind). Then Mewis falls in the box with no contact, and Aly Wagner thinks it should be a card. Every sports journalist who watched women\u2019s soccer religiously -- every four years -- would be aghast. They think US women don\u2019t dive. Nice one here ... Our Caitlin Murray, for one, does not think this is over. Hey, maybe Jill Ellis will bring in Carli Lloyd for Abby Dahlkemper just to make it interesting. 14 min: Torrent whacks Rapinoe\u2019s ankle from behind as is lucky not to see yellow. (As you may recall from the last MBM, I am not a US homer. This has just been dreadful from France so far.) 13 min: Finally some attacking possession for France, and actually, it\u2019s a half-decent chance in the end as Le Sommer gets her head on the second cross attempt. Naeher snares it, but replay showed it was going ... Pardon me -- Morgan shoots at the other end. Can we possibly try Spain\u2019s defense with France\u2019s offense? Would they have a chance? Look, so many French players play for Lyon, who win every game by a score of 308-0. You think they know how to play from behind? Forget it. It\u2019s over. But follow along with us anyway 8 min: France finally attack on Dunn\u2019s flank. They\u2019re offside. Well, maybe. Looked OK on the replay. OK, no deflection, and the three-time global goalkeeper of the year just lost the ball in traffic. It\u2019s over. Calling it now. Bring on USA-England. Rapinoe\u2019s free kick goes into traffic and emerges on the other side. Surely it was deflected? 5 min: We spend a rather long time setting this up for some reason .. and ... 4 min: YELLOW CARD to Mbock! The USA take a quick throw-in, and Mbock grabs Alex Morgan as she races down the left flank near the box. Free kick now that Rapinoe will take. She has been erratic with these. 2 min: Speaking of left backs who attack, Amel Majri (wearing No. 10) tries to work her way past O\u2019Hara into the US box. She falls. There was no contact. Not a good idea. Refs from Ukraine don\u2019t fall for that. 1 min: Instead of going straight at the left-back who isn\u2019t a left-back, Crystal Dunn, France try to walk a tightrope down their left. The USA go the other direction, Rapinoe finds space to play to Ertz, and the USA already have as many shots on goal from the run of play as they did against Spain. Kickoff: The countdown is English. The kickoff is French. The ball is out of play. OK, all silliness aside -- this is one of those matchups you dream of seeing in sports. It\u2019s a privilege to be here to talk about it. Here we go ... Speaking of penalty controversies, today\u2019s officials are ... The first was rather obvious, wasn\u2019t it? Anyway, tonight\u2019s people in green are ... Referee: Kateryna MONZUL (UKR) AR1: Marina STRILETSKA (UKR) AR2: Oleksandra ARDASHEVA (UKR) FO: Kate JAZEWICZ (AUS) Reserve AR: KIM Kyoung Min (KOR) VAR: Danny MAKKELIE (NED) AVAR1: Chantal BOUDREAU (CAN) AVAR2: Pawel GIL (POL) Whoa, whoa ... a Canadian? With a French name? A few more of your pregame thoughts before I go into full-bore game mode. I mean full-blown. Hopefully not full bore. alincoln on Twitter, presumably referring to Horan\u2019s omission from the starting XI: \u201cRemember when Greg Ryan started Scurry over Solo against Brazil in 2007 WC?This is Ellis\u2019 Greg Ryan moment and will also be her last game as HC of the USWNT.\u201d Was there an off-field issue with Horan? Joe Pearson has already has wine. I\u2019m on my third soda, which I never do. I don\u2019t think caffeine affects me, though -- hey, should I rewire the entertainment center while I watch? I think I\u2019ll also juggle. Julian Borrill: \u201cRed, white, blue - US ... Bleu, blanc, rouge - France\u201d Je parle francais un peu, mais ma vocabulaire est tres mal. I\u2019m the product of US schools. You\u2019re all lucky I can speak English. Peter Oh: \u201cI like the sound of \u201cthe Statue of Liberty derby\u201d. Hopefully this match will be remembered only for the actions of the ladies on the pitch, and I\u2019m not talking about the referees. No VARc de Triomphe, please!\u201d Actually, I heard they checked the video again, and they\u2019ve taken back the penalty awarded on the Lavelle we-won\u2019t-say-dive incident against Spain. We\u2019ll have to play the rest of that game again. Anthems are underway, and France has the USA beaten there. Pregame scenes As ever, I\u2019m astounded at the disposable income Americans can conjure for things like this. I can\u2019t even afford to see my alma mater play basketball, but I made poor career choices. \u201cPoor\u201d as in financial. This is clearly its own reward. Speaking of the red, white and blue, we have this from the mailbag from Jamison MacLachlan ... \u201cThe one HUGE Achilles Heel the US has is that they seem to have an inability to either recognize they need to make adjustments in game or they refuse to. ... If the US plays the way they did against Spain....lacking awareness and creativity in adjusting on both sides of the ball....it could be a long night for my red white and blue.\u201d Which red, white and blue, though? Speaking of the seven European teams in the last eight, Shane Hart asks a question of all England fans: Who do you want to win? Red, white and blue! I lost the tweet that referred to this game as the Statue of Liberty matchup. At least we\u2019re remembering that wonderful celebration of democratic ideals and not selling \u201cfreedom fries\u201d any more. From our correspondent on the scene ... Brandon Dwonch, in the inbox: \u201cI have not looked towards to a game this much since the Champions League Final.\u201d But he says it\u2019ll be goalless, and France will win 4-3 in PKs. (Or, as we pedants call it, kicks from the mark.) Worth noting -- the USA didn\u2019t have a lot of shots on goal in the game against Spain. To be precise, three, including the two penalties. Also on the interwebs ... Predictions I picked the USA to win it all before we started, and I\u2019m sticking with it. I also picked Australia to reach the final, so I may not be good at this. Today, I\u2019m thinking if the US women score the first goal, it\u2019s all but over. The French have a word for how that will feel -- D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The host country has had a good team throughout the 2010s, but medals have been elusive. In 2011, two late goals by Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan pushed the US to a 3-1 win in the semifinals. They\u2019ve never been closer to the top three than that. Controversy No. 3: The heat Tom Lutz informs me that, contrary to what I said previously, our sun cannot go supernova. That will be of little comfort in France, which just saw a record temperature of 45.9C. That\u2019s nearly 115 degrees in US temperatures. Or, as we sometimes call it, Death Valley hot. But at Parc des Princes, it\u2019s merely 30 degrees. That\u2019s 86 in the USA, the land of stubborn measurements. And we\u2019re told it\u2019s not the same humidity as those of us who dwell on the US East Coast swim in every day. Unchanged from the last game. And it\u2019s pretty much as projected from our team guide. Wendie Renard has made the odd uncharacteristic mistake here, but she and Griedge Mbock are a generally sound defensive partnership. And like the US women, they have more attackers than they can possibly start, with Delphine Cascarino being the in-vogue supersub. AKA Controversy No. 2: Lindsey Horan\u2019s omission Lindsey Horan is a tremendous two-way midfielder. She has experience playing with an against the French players. She sat out the round of 16 game against Spain until the very end, perhaps because she was carrying a yellow card, and a second would put her out of action for the game against France. As it turns out, that didn\u2019t matter. Out of the four main US midfielders -- Horan, defensive destroyer / attacker Julie Ertz, two-way player Samantha Mewis, and playmaker Rose Lavelle -- Horan is the one that sits. Another option Jill Ellis would have had -- sit Becky Sauerbrunn, one of the finest defenders in women\u2019s soccer\u2019s relatively brief history but coming off some minor injury concerns and a major mistake against Spain, to move Ertz to center back. Didn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s the familiar lineup at the back: Alyssa Naeher in goal, Sauerbrunn and Abby Dahlkemper at center back, attack-minded Crystal Dunn at left back, attack-minded Kelley O\u2019Hara at right back, Ertz behind Mewis and Lavelle in the middle, Megan Rapinoe trying to do better on the left flank than she did against Spain, Tobin Heath trying to see more of the ball on the right than she did against Spain, and Alex Morgan trying to be fouled out of the play a lot less than she did against Spain. Personally, I\u2019d put Dunn at forward in place of Rapinoe, and I\u2019d go back in time to include Casey Short on the roster so she could play left back. Controversy No. 1: Equal pay Please check out the work Caitlin Murray and Sam Morris did with respect to the comparative World Cup bonuses that the US women might achieve in the next 10 days and the US men might achieve before the sun goes supernova. This is, of course, part of a couple of larger questions, and not just the glass ceiling in American workplaces. The tough part is that FIFA\u2019s bonuses are pretty far from equal. In 2018, France got $38 million. This year, the winner will get $4 million. So your options are these ... It\u2019s Brazil-Germany in the men\u2019s World Cup. It\u2019s Ronda Rousey vs. Cris Cyborg, had Rousey stuck with MMA and gone back up to her old weight class. It\u2019s Kelly Clarkson vs. Susan Boyle in an all-star battle of reality-contest singers. It\u2019s big. Grande. Incroyable. Super Bowls are hyped for two weeks. This game has been hyped since the World Cup draw was made in December, assuming the USA and France would win their groups and their eighth-final games. (As it turns out, each team made hard work of it.) So this could be a contest of titanic proportions. Or it could be Mike Tyson knocking out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. But let\u2019s hope not. The winner faces England, which will be the next epic match. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Caitlin Murray on how today\u2019s game may be settled: The set piece battle \u201cWe take set pieces very seriously,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said in France before the USA\u2019s first game of the tournament. \u201cThose are moments you can practice, you can set things up, you can potentially catch the other team off guard, go quickly or if you\u2019e got tricky plays. We have a lot of specialists in all the different areas of set plays.\u201d Although the Americans are traditionally been strong on set pieces, such scenarios haven\u2019t been the deciding factor for the Americans yet. France, meanwhile, have scored five of their goals in this tournament from set plays. Samantha Mewis, standing at almost 6ft tall, is the tallest outfield player the US have ever had. Wendie Renard, the French center back, has at least two inches on her and is the tallest player in this World Cup. If there\u2019s a play the US will have to watch on corner kicks, it is surely Renard. \u201cShe\u2019s great in the air and a really well-rounded player,\u201d Mewis said Wednesday. \u201cWe all have so much respect for her and I think our setup on set pieces will remain the same \u2013 we just have to make sure were doing our jobs and executing because she\u2019s definitely dangerous.\u201d You can read the full article below:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
