Then there was the referee. Allardyce believed passionately that Mike Riley, who will officiate in the European Championship in Portugal this summer, made two crucial wrong decisions: the penalty awarded to Middlesbrough, and the lack of a penalty to his own side in the last few minutes when Ugo Ehiogu hurled himself at a shot by Stelios Giannakopoulos. \"We've always had a problem with Mike Riley and he's lived up to his reputation,\" said Allardyce. \"Ehiogu's arm came out and he played the ball. It was a clear-cut penalty.\" Not to everyone it wasn't - just as most inside the Millennium Stadium totally missed the fact that Bolo Zenden double-hit the penalty. Riley had been involved in the sending-off of Bolton players in the past, decisions which have obviously remained an open wound for Allardyce. Yet to suggest the referee has some sort of grudge is preposterous. This was not Riley's finest hour but the Emerson Thome challenge on Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Job for the Boro penalty brooked little argument and few referees would have awarded handball against Ehiogu. The core of Allardyce's disappointment, which spilled over into his criticism of the referee, was that his side, having apparently been so meticulously prepared, were caught stone cold in the opening five minutes. \"A terrible, terrible, terrible start,\" said Allardyce, shaking his head to the awful rhythm of the words. \"And we just couldn't overcome it.\" Bolton tried marginally harder and were the better side for the remainder of the first half, only to be denied by Mark Schwarzer, a man who needed redemption more than anyone on the pitch - save for Riley, if Allardyce was to be believed. The post-match jubilation may have assuaged his howler which let in Kevin Davies but he will surely wake up in a cold sweat for many a long night and demand to be shown the final result to put his mind at rest. \"We were very, very edgy, but if Youri had put away any of the three chances that came to him we might have turned it round,\" said Allardyce. \"I was confident at half-time but we were always overanxious. A few of our players will be looking at themselves now and wondering if this will be their last final.\" Bolton fans will equally wonder if they will soon have seen the last of Okocha, the Nigerian whose charismatic skills have so lifted the hearts of those in the Reebok Stadium. At the final whistle he cut a disconsolate figure; his influence on the match had been marginal and his final shot, hit more in hope than expectation, had scudded straight to Schwarzer, who on this occasion made trebly sure there was no hole between his body and his hands. It was noticeable that whereas Ehiogu, Danny Mills and Gareth Southgate all gave up a little time to offer Okocha a consolatory pat on the shoulders, not a single Bolton player went over to their captain. He sat hunched up in the centre-circle, pulling his white shirt over his face as he fought to blank out the disappointment. And it was only Iv\u00e1n Campo initially who had the good grace to acknowledge his own fans. The rest of the Bolton team were lost in their own worlds of gloom and heavy despond. What a contrast to Southgate, who, having finally won something in his long career, orchestrated the equally joyous Boro fans as they surfed a tidal wave of delirium that had been building up for 128 years. Bolton last won a trophy when Nat Lofthouse bundled both ball and Harry Gregg into the net in the FA Cup final against Manchester United in 1958 - and what would Riley have made of that? Perhaps Bolton have been paying for it ever since. \"I don't want to sound bitter,\" said Allardyce, and then he made a good stab at it. But he did manage to acknowledge that, as disappointed as he was, Middlesbrough had been the better side. And so they were."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
