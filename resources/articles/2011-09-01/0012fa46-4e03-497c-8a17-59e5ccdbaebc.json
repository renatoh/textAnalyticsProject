In an echo of his predecessor Billy Davies's frustration with the board, the former England manager believes he is not being given sufficient backing to have a realistic chance of promotion with the Championship club. \"He is disappointed and frustrated at the lack of further additions, as he thinks he is short of what is required to take the club to promotion,\" a source close to McClaren is reported as saying. \"He is going away for a few days to reflect on things.\" When the transfer window closed, Forest had spent \u00a32m on Ishmael Miller and Jonathan Greening against nine players who had left. They signed three players on free transfers: George Boateng, Matt Derbyshire and Andy Reid. McClaren is said to have returned to his family home in the north-east to consider his future. The former England manager could only watch on frustratedly as Sven-Goran Eriksson, the manager of promotion rivals Leicester City, and Sam Allardyce of West Ham were able to strengthen their squads over the summer. \"Steve came here in the hope of taking Forest up and was working on that basis,\" another source was quoted as saying. \"But he has always said that the squad needed bolstering in order to do that.\" Forest lie 18th in the Championship and McClaren is said to have been questioning the ambition of the owner, Nigel Doughty, less than three months into the job. McClaren had wanted to sign Ashkan Dejagah, a winger whom he managed at Wolfsburg, and moves for Max Gradel, who left Leeds United for St Etienne, and Wayne Routledge, who joined Swansea City from Newcastle United, also fell through. Doughty, a venture capitalist who has an estimated \u00a3130m fortune, has invested \u00a370m in the club during his 11 years as owner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
