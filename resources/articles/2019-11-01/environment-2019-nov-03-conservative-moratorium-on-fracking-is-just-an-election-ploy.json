Remember that politicians, even Conservative prime ministers, have a record of telling high-profile lies, especially in the run-up to an election. Remember David Cameron\u2019s emphatic assurance that there would be no new Heathrow runway, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d, repeated several times before the 2010 general election? Boris Johnson, whose promises have frequently been shown to be false, knows fracking is unpopular in a number of Midlands and northern constituencies, including Conservative targets. He might well assure us that fracking will be banned, but in the longer term cite \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d to reverse the pledge. David Packham Bath \u2022 The government has suddenly halted fracking until \u201ccompelling new evidence is provided\u201d that proves it is safe. I would wager that Andrea Leadsom will unveil said evidence the week after the marginal Midlands and northern constituencies, who are strongly against fracking, have voted in her colleagues. The government hasn\u2019t \u201cbanned\u201d anything. It has temporarily halted an unnecessary and unpopular practice to gain some votes. Simon Richards Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire \u2022 On 1 May 1987 a Conservative government announced it was abandoning plans for nuclear waste sites, in Bedfordshire, where I was involved in the anti-nuclear dumping movement, and in three other sites across England, prior to a general election that was held on 11 June that year. I can only hope that the results this year do not reflect those of 1987. Janice Gupta Gwilliam Norton, North Yorkshire \u2022 In October 2017 when a fracking ban was announced north of the border the Scottish Conservatives said that this was \u201ca shortsighted economically damaging decision\u201d. It is of course welcome to see England following Scotland\u2019s lead in this, but it is rather hypocritical of the Tories given their comments in 2017. Alex Orr Edinburgh \u2022 On Saturday Andrea Leadsom said on the Today programme that the moratorium is in place \u201cuntil the science changes\u201d. I conclude that the science is on schedule to change around the same time Boris Johnson presents his next Queen\u2019s speech. Just one of a vast number of reasons why the Tories should not be allowed anywhere near the next Queen\u2019s speech.
