It has placed a bet that the courts will be dug up some time within the next 50 years. The opposing party in the bet is none other than the chairman of the championships, Tim Phillips. Cyclops is not going to be so indiscreet as to reveal the amount of the wager but given that both parties agree that, unless the monkey glands kick in, they may not be around to settle the wager, a third party has been appointed to do so on behalf of their estates. I've just seen a girl called Maria Your typical tennis correspondent - the male ones, anyway - are often accused of being unduly interested in the physiology of Maria Sharapova, to which most would almost certainly plead guilty. But it is not just your average tennis hack who recognises the inherent splendour of La Sharapova's form. The new Wimbledon Museum features a remarkable film and guess who is the central character. Yup, that's right - the 2004 women's champion. And some mighty interesting images there are of her, too, including this one (below). Graham English and Company made the film, The Science of Tennis, which also features some pretty incredible sequences from a match that Sharapova played last year. It was filmed using five digital video cameras to give a 200-degree panorama. The film has drawn comparisons with The Matrix films, which, English points out, is a little far-fetched given the multimillion-dollar budget of the Hollywood blockbusters . 'But, hey,' says Graham, 'it's great to think that someone is comparing the production values of the two; either they don't understand how much things really cost or we've just done a great job. I'd like to think it's the latter....' Sharapova fans will definitely think it's the latter. No, not Boris Qualifying threw up an interesting name in the men's singles, one B Becker of Germany. But no, it's not him. Benjamin Becker will never achieve the boy-wonder feats of his near namesake. This will be a first grand slam for the 25-year-old. Blake, English to the marrow What could the following description of World War Two action possibly have to do with Wimbledon...? 'Sgt Jack Misseldine was flying a 611 Squadron Spitfire on a diversionary mission when he was shot down near Steenbecque, just south of Hazebrouck on 8 June 1942. He was soon picked up by the local resistance and taken to nearby Aire-sur-la-Lys where he was sheltered for the next two weeks. At the end of the month he was taken to Paris by a young Belgian called Albert who wanted to join the Free Belgian forces in London....' Well, Jack - or John as he is known by his family - is now 84, a very proud Englishman, although he lives in the south of France, and over the next fortnight will be keeping a keen eye on the progress of the highly rated American player James Blake, who is his first cousin (one generation removed). Other members of the Misseldine clan, including Blake's mother Bet and aunt Phyllis, are due at Wimbledon to watch how the men's eighth seed fares. Phyllis was the one who started the Misseldine exodus from Banbury in Oxfordshire to the US in 1948. She was later joined by her mother and her siblings Bet and Albert. Bet's first husband died and she met her second husband, Tom Blake, on the tennis court. They had two sons, Thomas and James. John, Bet's first cousin, is the family historian who some years ago staged a Misseldine reunion at Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, which is where the family come from. A Spitfire pilot as a cousin, a mother whose maiden name has its origins in an ancient English town... what else can we do but claim James Blake as our own if he wins. Too long for Little It's a long story, but suffice to say Cyclops was browsing through the Daily Mail of 6 July 1906 the other day. The paper's report of the women's final of that year, in which Britain's Dorothea Douglass upset the American May Sutton 6-3 9-7, said the match kept the crowd transfixed 'for three solid hours, from three o'clock until after six, in a continual state of excitement and trembling enthusiasm'. Not only does this make it considerably longer than the 57 minutes given in Alan Little's impressively researched annual, the Wimbledon Compendium, but makes it longer than the two hours 45 minutes of last year's memorable final between Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport, which was touted as Wimbledon's longest ever women's final. But it takes more than a Daily Mail report to make Alan, the honorary librarian at the museum and something of an institution at the All England Club, give way, even though matches were not officially timed 100 years ago. He says he is happy to back his figure against the newspaper's. Our man and Amelie If Amelie Mauresmo (below) wins on the lawns of SW19 on Saturday week, it will be in some small part due to the generosity of our man in Paris, Sir John Holmes. After her early exit from the French Open, Mauresmo was offered the chance to practise on what she says is France's only grass court, at the ambassador's residence on Rue de Faubourg St Honore. 'It was very kind of him,' says Mauresmo of the keen tennis fan. Why, you spoil her, Mr Ambassador."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
