In a parallel with his Leicester and England team-mate Martin Johnson, whose five-week ban last season for kneeing the Saracens fly-half Duncan McRae ended one day before the opening Six Nations international against Wales, Healey was handed a suspension which will work to the convenience of England, who have injury problems at scrum-half. He was given 21 days and will be free to play for his club in their Heineken Cup quarter-final on January 26, a week before the Scotland clash. His ban was timed from January 4, the date Leicester imposed their own two-week ban which would effectively have meant his missing last Saturday's Heineken Cup game against Calvisano, which he would probably have been rested from anyway. Healey was one of five players summoned before a disciplinary panel yesterday after a stormy round of Zurich Premiership matches at the end of last month and the aggregate suspension of 11 weeks was far less than anticipated. The Northampton prop Mattie Stewart will be available for Scotland after a reprimand for kneeing and punching a London Irish player and the Sale flanker Alex Sanderson was also warned as to his future conduct for spitting in the direction of Leicester players. The most high-profile case involved Gloucester's hooker Olivier Azam and the Newcastle flanker Epi Taione who were sent off for fighting at Kingsholm. The panel refused to consider allegations of racial abuse by Newcastle and the Rugby Football Union will set up a three-man inquiry team in the next few days to look at that issue. Newcastle's rugby director Rob Andrew accused Azam of calling Taione a \"black bastard\" and claimed that Gloucester had ejected fans from the ground for racial abuse. Relations between the clubs deteriorated to such an extent that Andrew was banned from Kingsholm but representatives from both met before yesterday's hearing and agreed there would be no more mud-slinging before the RFU inquiry was completed. Newcastle tried to play the race card at Taione's hearing but were told it was not the proper place. Taione was suspended for three weeks for punching Azam and the Gloucester hooker received a five-week suspension on the basis of previous form: he was banned twice last season after being sent off for butting in France's A international against Wales and was then disciplined for receiving three yellow cards at club level. He was also banned for three weeks for spitting in Taione's face but that punishment will run concurrently with his five-week one, making him eligible for France early next month and raising the question of whether club and international disciplinary matters should, as they are in soccer, be separate. Whereas Azam's previous was taken into account, the 56-day ban that Healey received in 1999 for kicking the London Irish scrum-half Kevin Putt was not. The disciplinary panel, showing nimbler footwork than the scrum-half, decided that his foul play against the Sale wing Anthony Elliott amounted to a cross between a kick and a trip and that it bore no relation to his action on Putt. \"Austin Healey's previous offence was three years ago and it was materially different from the new charge,\" said the panel's chairman Jeff Blackett. \"Olivier Azam had clearly not learned his lesson from last season and that was why he received a suspension higher than the normal one imposed for his offence.\" Healey, Sanderson and Stewart faced the panel after being referred by the RFU's citing commissioner Johnny Johnson, his first action since being appointed, and all three were found guilty. \"The citing commissioners are finding their way to a certain extent in judg ing what is and is not acceptable behaviour,\" said Blackett. The RFU's disciplinary officer Robert Horner said he hoped that his panel to look at the allegations of racial abuse would be racially mixed, chaired by a high court judge and include a member of the RFU and a senior club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
