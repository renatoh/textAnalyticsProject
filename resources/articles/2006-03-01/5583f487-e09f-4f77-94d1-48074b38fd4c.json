This ugly monstrosity of concrete blast walls, razor wire, armoured vehicles and soldiers in flak jackets seemed beautiful. It was October 20. Hours earlier I had been manacled in a bare, unlit, concrete cell in a Baghdad suburb, unsure whether I would be shot, beheaded or, perhaps far into the future, released. Instead, just 36 hours after I had been kidnapped while reporting for the Guardian, the handcuffs were removed, I was bundled into a car boot and left unharmed by a roadside. A convoy of police, soldiers and private guards escorted me deep into the internationally protected green zone. It was like winning the lottery, but better. I was a dazed celebrity. Everybody grinned and wanted to shake my hand. British diplomats and guards lined up outside the embassy in welcome. Cameras flashed as I greeted the ambassador. Ushered through the embassy's tiled corridors it began to sink in: I was free. And receiving stellar service. Would I like some tea, a beer, something to eat, a cigarette? The post-hostage protocol started with a medical examination to check the physical and pyschological impact. Then the debrief. A Scotland Yard detective and two other British security officials wanted as much detail as possible on every aspect of the kidnapping. In one previous case, said the detective, a former hostage recalled the scent of a particular fruit tree which led security forces to the kidnappers' lair. Methodically, I described what had happened: the interviews I and my Iraqi staff conducted near the Shia slum known as Sadr City, the three cars which cut us off, the gunmen who took me, the safe house, the cell, the release. No detail was too small or obscure. In what sequence did those particular seven men enter the room? What type of shoes did they wear? Any jewellery? What type of guns? How many mobile phones? Was the cell door wooden or metal? What type of lock? Any unusual chips or markings on the wall? What about the floor? After the debrief was the homecoming, interview requests, a million emails then, eventually, life getting back to normal. Though the questions never stop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
