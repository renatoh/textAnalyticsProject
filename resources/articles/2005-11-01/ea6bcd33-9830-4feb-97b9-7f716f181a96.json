Despite requesting an allocation of more than 8,000 tickets based on initial interest the Football Association received 7,000 applications and this week returned the unsold tickets to the agency promoting the game. The returned tickets were snapped up in a matter of hours in Geneva yesterday when they went on sale in supermarkets and at a shopping centre opposite the stadium, indicating that the Swiss hosts are as interested in the clash of the old enemies as they are in their World Cup play-off with Turkey taking place on Saturday evening in Berne. Despite the lower than expected take-up from members of the FA supporters' club the match will still see one of the largest travelling contingents for an England fixture outside a qualifying tournament or competition finals. With the game taking place 30 minute's drive from Uefa's offices in Nyon, many of the European game's sharpest suits are expected to be at the Stade de Geneve, and remarkably Uefa's top brass will be rolling out the red carpet for England fans earlier in the day. Two years after they threatened to expel England from Euro 2004 because of the behaviour of supporters at the infamous qualifying match against Turkey in Sunderland, a Uefa staff side will take on an England fans' XI before hosting a cheese and wine reception at their grand marble-and-glass HQ on the banks of Lake Geneva. RFU not turning Japanese The Rugby Football Union board meets today to decide which of the three 2011 World Cup bids to back at next week's vote in Dublin, with South Africa and Japan fighting it out for Twickenham's support. While the Japanese bid is clearly the most adventurous, would do more to spread the game and has the support of the management committee member Peter Wheeler, the RFU was more impressed by a recent presentation by South Africa's World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar. Despite a personal letter from the New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark to the RFU chairman Martyn Thomas, Twickers has little appetite for a return to New Zealand, particularly so soon after the Lions debacle. Though the RFU has concerns over safety in South Africa, money may be decisive in its decision. South Africa's Europe-friendly time difference appeals to broadcasters who bankroll the game and they are promising the most revenue. Even if Twickenham does back South Africa, bookmakers make Japan favourites to win the final vote on Wednesday despite rumours that Nelson Mandela will make the trip to Dublin. Spurs' French option Tottenham's sporting director Damien Comolli was recruited to add a continental edge to the club's policy of snapping up the best young English talent, and the Frenchman will have his eye on some of the brightest prospects from France at White Hart Lane tonight when Les Bleus meet England in an Under-21 international. Comolli will be keeping a particularly close eye on the Marseille winger Franck Ribery whom he is known to rate highly and who may be his first target when the January transfer window opens. Mum's the word, James Great Britain's rugby league captain is having an Andrew Cole moment. Jamie Peacock, pictured, said he would prefer to be known as James. \"I'm not that bothered but my mum prefers James,\" said Andy Farrell's successor yesterday. If his struggling side continue to perform as they have done so far in the Tri-Nations series Captain Peacock risks becoming Calamity James. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
