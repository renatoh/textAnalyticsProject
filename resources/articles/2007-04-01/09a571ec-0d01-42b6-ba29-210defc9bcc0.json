All that is required is the approval of the paper's former owner, Sheikh Mohammed, who passed the Post on to MGN for \u00a31 nine years ago. Starting today, Flat jockeys are limited to riding at a maximum of nine meetings in seven days. However, extra man hours will be required at Weatherbys, whose computer cannot pick up on riders booked for a 10th fixture. That means extra cross- checking and ringing round for employees of racing's administrators. Northern jump jockeys are marvelling that Hexham race on Monday afternoon with nearby Sedgefield in the evening. As one remarked, riding fees should just about cover speeding fines incurred. Racing's worst-kept secret was revealed last week when Mick Fitzgerald announced he would continue as stable jockey to Nicky Henderson. We understand Noel Fehily was in line for the job if Fitz had decided to call it a day. For a 70th birthday present, Barry Hills was the surprise recipient from son Michael of a copy of Mark Johnston's autobiography. We gather the Lambourn trainer is working on his own life story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
