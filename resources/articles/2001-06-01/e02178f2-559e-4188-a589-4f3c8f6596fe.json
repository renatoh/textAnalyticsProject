His staging of Handel's Tamerlano (seen recently in Paris and at the prestigious Handel festival in Halle, Germany) is spare and uncluttered - the only set is a pair of marbled golden walls and an understated throne. Those who believe Handel's operas need no gimmickry may be grateful that Miller hasn't dressed Tamerlano up in anything other than Judy Levin's sumptuous costumes. But this is a long work - over three hours, even with cuts. It suffers from dramatic pacing that nobody could call swift, and Miller's static staging does little to further its momentum. At times it seemed that the characters' wardrobes were developing with more speed than the plot. The first half of the opera introduces the captive Turkish king Bajazet and his daughter Asteria, who is involved in a convoluted love rectangle. There's lots of fine music, plenty of despairing or angry arias for those involved, much swirling of cloaks as the characters march resolutely offstage - but not a great deal of action. By comparison, the revelations and murder attempts in the second half come thick and fast. Musically, too, the opera grows more varied. But much of it comes too late; for example, if Asteria and Andronico had established their chemistry with a duet in act one approaching the beauty of the one in act three, we might have been rooting for them all along. It was left to Thomas Randle to supply the most charismatic performance. Bajazet is a low role for a tenor, but Randle has the reserves for it. His farewell to Asteria was particularly effective, delivered in a barely audible whisper. It was good to hear Elisabeth Norberg-Schulz's satiny soprano as Asteria, and the softer, expressive mezzo of Anna Bonitatibus as Irene. In general, though, neither the voices nor the period instruments benefited from the bone-dry acoustic of Sadler's Wells. Trevor Pinnock conducted the English Concert; and while his players performed with vigour and contrast, Handel's music can sound far more sensuous than it did here. This was a long evening's opera, but not a very engaging one. Performance repeated and broadcast on Radio 3 on Saturday. Box office: 020-7863 8000. Sadler's Wells"}, "isHosted": false}}}
