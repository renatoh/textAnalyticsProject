The Old Trafford tea lady seemed more likely to clash with Alex than Scholesy, although I must say I have some sympathy with the player. Normally you'd say a player's responsibility is to turn out when he's asked, full stop. But I can see Scholes's reasons for not wanting to play in the Worthington Cup at Arsenal last Monday. Having been dropped at Liverpool on Sunday, he must have felt put out at being asked to play for the reserves in a game Manchester United weren't bothered about five days before an England international. That's not to say I condone Scholes's behaviour. He may have had a case but he was wrong to go against his manager and I understand why he's been fined two weeks' wages. At a club you can't have one rule for one and another for others. When a player steps out of line you have to take action. There are plenty of different ways of handling things and after Paul McGrath failed to turn up for an Aston Villa cup tie at Exeter I made him pay for a trip to Tenerife for the rest of the boys. We didn't allow him to come but he had to pick up the tab for our five-day break, which came to about \u00a310,000. We had won at Exeter, which helped, but the lads knew he was wrong and I made sure they benefited. While we were in Tenerife, Paul was training at home. What was important is there were no grudges. If a player's constantly doing things then you get rid, but otherwise it's best as a manager just to get on with everything once you've meted out the punishment. Don't mention the incident and don't behave any differently towards them. Let it blow over rather than fester. McGrath was held in great respect by the lads at Villa and came back to be our best player again for the next two years. I suspect the Scholes incident could work in United's favour. My betting is it will all calm down and might give the little ginger man a kick up the backside. If he's thinking \"I'll show the manager I can play\" then it's worked for Alex. That's the attitude you want from your players. You're not looking to win popularity contests but saying: \"Show me I'm wrong to leave you out.\" It wouldn't surprise me if England get the benefit against Sweden tomorrow and Scholes gets two or three. He won't have harmed the spirit at United because the players will understand and know he's got no complaints about the course of action. Similarly, another incident I had at Villa did no long-term damage. On a pre-season trip to Japan three players overstepped the mark when they were supposed to be in at a certain time. I didn't make a big deal of it but when everyone was picking up their boarding passes to fly home, they were handed three seats at the back of the plane rather than in first class with the rest of us. I suspect Scholes's reaction was frustration. Because of his new role and the fact that he's not on top of his game, he's having a tough time. If I could have one player in the box with the ball to score a goal to save my life, I'd have Scholes before most. But this season it hasn't quite happened for him. I thought he'd be made-to-measure for that support striker role because I can't think of anyone in England who's better at breaking from midfield. But he's possibly receiving with his back to goal too much and I wonder whether Ruud van Nistelrooy is the type who looks to hold the ball up and allow someone to get up in support. Ruud seems to be looking for the ball through, so often it means a longer distance for Scholes to catch up. A lot of his advances into the box over recent years have come, albeit from deeper, when Teddy Sheringham or Dwight Yorke has been ahead to hold the ball up and play him in. Also, because Scholes is such an honest lad on the field, he must find it hard to \"cheat\" a bit. What I mean by that is abandoning a certain amount of defensive responsibility. If an opposing midfielder runs past, leave him for others. Sheringham isn't often tracking back into his own box, so he can play on the rebound, ready to be fed in a dangerous area if a team-mate wins possession. For Scholes, who's been brought up with all the good habits of doing his work for the side, that must be difficult."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
