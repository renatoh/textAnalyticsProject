Oliver Letwin, a former cabinet minister, was among the signatories to a Labour-led attempt to tie the next prime minister\u2019s hands by ruling out no deal. It was defeated by 11 votes after eight Labour MPs voted with the government and 13 abstained, cancelling out 10 Conservative rebels who voted with Labour. The defeat means parliament has now exhausted the options for preventing a no-deal exit, according to Letwin. \u201cWe have run out of all the possibilities that any of us can at the moment think of,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The interviewer Nick Robinson pointed out that MPs could not block a no-deal exit happening by default if no legislation was put before parliament. Letwin said: \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely good summary of the situation, alas.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t bring something before parliament, parliament won\u2019t have a chance to take a view on that.\u201d He played down the prospect of Tory MPs voting down their own government to prevent no deal. Letwin said: \u201cEvidently that\u2019s not something any of us want to do.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not confident as things stand that the current Labour leadership would know how to solve this crisis either.\u201d Letwin said he was not sure if Boris Johnson, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, was a \u201cno-deal Brexiteer\u201d. He conceded Johnson was \u201cclearly quite likely\u201d to become the next prime minister. The former Conservative MP Nick Boles, who flew back to the UK to vote with Labour on Wednesday, also conceded that opponents of a no-deal departure were fast running out of options, apart from a confidence vote to bring down the government. He said: \u201cNo-deal Brexit on 31 October is back to being a racing certainty. It is very hard to see where any further legislative opportunities will come from. So it\u2019s now a question of politics \u2013 specifically whether a PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit can command and sustain the confidence of the House of Commons.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
