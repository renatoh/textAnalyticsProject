In a tacit admission that the current NHS test and trace system had not been enough to contain the virus, Johnson heralded a mass testing operation beginning in Liverpool, the start of an ambitious programme \u201cOperation Moonshot\u201d which would involve the entire population tested on a regular basis. The prime minister also appeared to affirm the government expected the four-week national lockdown in England would be enough to get the virus\u2019s reproduction R number below one \u2013 raising questions as to whether the lockdown would be extended should that not occur. \u201cOnce again we are alas asking everybody to stay at home to protect the NHS to save lives and get the R down below one. I know we can, I know we will. It\u2019s only just above one at the moment,\u201d he said. Speaking to the cabinet meeting, Johnson acknowledged that there would be dissent in the party. MPs will vote on Wednesday on the latest measures, with a small rebellion expected of Tory MPs \u2013 though any extension of lockdown measures would be likely to cause a far larger rebellion. \u201cLet\u2019s be in no doubt none of us came into politics to introduce measures like this,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing things to repress liberty, we don\u2019t want to do anything to damage our economy, to stop business from going about their lives, to stop anybody from doing what they wanted to do. But \u2026 what we\u2019re doing is vital to suppress the virus and to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.\u201d Johnson reiterated that doctors and nurses would \u201cbe forced to make appalling choices on who to treat and who not to treat\u201d if nothing further was done. However, he said there was a \u201cclear way ahead\u201d and said the deadline of 2 December was a hard finish \u2013 and that a new solution needed to be developed by then. \u201cWe have a very clear way ahead. These measures \u2013 the crucial thing to understand is that they expire on 2 December. They come to an end. And we therefore as a government and indeed as a country have a deadline and a target to develop solutions which previously \u2026 did not exist,\u201d he said. Johnson said rapid-turnaround testing \u201ccan be a massive and possibly decisive use to us in this country in defeating the virus\u201d. He said that \u201camid the uncertain gloom of November I see light ahead\u201d and said ministers must \u201cwork flat out as a government to repay the confidence of the people who are doing the right thing and following the latest autumn measures\u201d. With two days to go before measures come into effect, ministers earlier prompted confusion over England\u2019s new lockdown rules with Michael Gove apologising for incorrectly indicating tennis and golf could be played, as cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick apparently wrongly suggested a family would be allowed to meet a friend for a walk outside. Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, issued an apology for signalling that singles tennis and golf in pairs could still go ahead. Jenrick, the communities secretary, mistakenly said that a family could go for a walk with a friend \u2013 despite there being a two-person limit on people meeting outdoors when outside of households or support bubbles. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: \u201cThis is a pretty stark admission that fixing contact tracing isn\u2019t a priority for Boris Johnson. Ministers lost control of the virus in the first place because of their failure to build an effective localised contact tracing regime with proper support to help people isolate. \u201cThe priority for the next four weeks is rolling out saliva based testing more widely for key workers especially NHS staff, fixing contact tracing by putting local public health teams in charge and ensuring people have security to isolate when needed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
