Campbell, called up for the first time to England Under-21 squad for the game against Poland next week, is on loan to Hull from Manchester United and confirmed his potential as a striker when scored in the 20th and 33 minute. He has now scored seven times in his last nine appearances. Dean Windass came on with 20 minutes remaining and sealed the win in the 87th minute. Campbell's first goal came when he scored at the second attempt after the Colchester goalkeeper Dean Gerken had fumbled his shot and his second when he converted Henrik Pedersen's cross. Lisbie raised home hopes but could not stop high-flying Hull who have now moved level on points with West Bromwich Albion, but behind them in fifth place on goal difference. Colchester's cause was not helped by the sending off of Phil Ifil who was given a straight red card by the referee Pat Miller for a tripping Campbell after only 14 minutes. Adam Virgo had already been booked for a hefty challenge on the striker. Wolverhampton Wanderers moved just below the play-off zone with a 2-1 win over Scunthorpe who are sitting just above Colchester. Neill Collins scored with a header seven minutes from time. Scunthorpe's Andy Butler had given his side an early lead when he rose unchallenged to head home in the fourth minute but Michael Gray levelled for the home team in the 57th minute with a fine 20-yard strike. With just one win from their last seven league games at Molineux, Wolves were in desperate need of a home win and gained breathing space as Mick McCarthy's side grew in confidence after Gray's equaliser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
