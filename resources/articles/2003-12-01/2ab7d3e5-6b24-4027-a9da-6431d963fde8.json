Collins would take the lead role in the sitcom, which has a working title Sing Out Louise, as an ageing star who has given up treading the boards to run a dog grooming parlour. One source familiar with the project described it as \"The Golden Girls meets Absolutely Fabulous meets Whatever Happened To Baby Jane\". Sing Out Louise is still in the early stages of development and Collins and Harvey have not yet approached a UK broadcaster, but are understood to be considering pitching it to ITV. If commissioned, Sing Out Louise would be filmed at the world famous Ealing Studios. Returning to TV would be a major step for Collins, 70, whose best known TV work remains her portrayal of superbitch Alexis Carrington Colby in soapy US drama Dynasty in the 80s. Other cult classics include The Bitch and The Stud, both based on her sister's novels, and the Wild Women of Chastity Gulch. But the star also has a string of TV guest appearance credits to her name, stretching back to 60s shows including Batman, Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Persuaders and Mission: Impossible. Collins revealed that Harvey was working on a sitcom script for her at last night's British Comedy Awards, where she presented the best comedy gong to BBC show Coupling. Harvey's best known TV work is BBC2 sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, which starred Kathy Burke as the uncouth, loud-mouthed Linda and James Dreyfus as her struggling gay actor flatmate, Tom. Before that Harvey had worked in theatre for over a decade, writing plays including Hushabye Mountain, Boom Boom Bang-a-Bang and Beautiful Thing, which was subsequently made into a film. Harvey is also currently working on Von Trapped, a one off comedy for ITV1, starring Caroline Quentin as a woman obsessed with the Sound of Music. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
