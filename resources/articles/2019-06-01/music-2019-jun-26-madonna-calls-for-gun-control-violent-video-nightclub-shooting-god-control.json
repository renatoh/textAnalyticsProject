She makes a stark call for gun control, both in the song\u2019s lyrics and in a written statement at the end of the video, which reads: \u201cEvery year over 36,000 Americans are killed in acts of gun violence and approximately 100,000 more are shot and injured. No one is safe. Gun control. Now.\u201d She also quotes civil rights activist Angela Davis: \u201cI am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.\u201d The video features a tearful Madonna typing the song\u2019s lyrics: \u201cWhen they talk reforms, it makes me laugh / They pretend to help, it makes me laugh \u2026 They say that we need love / But we need more than this.\u201d The scenes are intercut with her imagining herself at a nightclub, beginning with the gun attack and rewinding through the evening, including a scene of her being mugged at gunpoint on the way to the club. The nightclub scenes are disturbing and bloody, depicting a gunman opening fire with an automatic rifle, and striking the attendees. Until the October 2017 shooting at a Las Vegas music festival which killed 58, the Pulse terror attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was shot and killed by police during the attack \u2013 he had described himself as an \u201cIslamic soldier\u201d and pledged allegiance to Islamic State. In a separate statement, Madonna said: \u201cI want to draw attention through my platform as an artist to a problem in America that is out of control and is taking the lives of innocent people. This crisis can end if our legislators act to change the laws that fail to protect us all.\u201d In a recent interview, Madonna said: \u201cWhen you think about the amount of people who have died, been killed, have been wounded, whose lives have been changed irrevocably because of the lack of gun control in America, it\u2019s such a huge, huge problem.\u201d In the same interview she also championed LGBT rights and criticised recent US restrictions on abortion, saying: \u201cWe fought really hard for a lot of these freedoms and now it seems like they are all systematically being taken away ... It doesn\u2019t make me feel hopeless. It just makes me want to fight back.\u201d God Control is directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund, who has made numerous videos with the singer beginning with Ray of Light in 1998. He has also frequently worked with Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9 and David Guetta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
