The train was spacious. I didn\u2019t know those old trains still existed in my country. You could easily dance among the aged wooden benches, on which people were sitting scattered here and there. Speaking in Russian, they made me feel as if I was travelling on the Trans-Siberian railway. My heart was racing, because at the end of this surreal ride I would see the man I loved. We\u2019d met two weeks earlier, and here I was on my way to visit him in the most unexpected of places: the nuclear plant town of Visaginas, in an area kept secret and closed off during the Soviet period, and where today 20,000 people still live. The aura surrounding Visaginas had always been spooky, alien, apocalyptic. Isolated amid forests and lakes, the Russian-speaking single-industry town was built in 1975. When the last reactor closed in 2009, Visaginas experienced an identity crisis. It was rumoured to be a separatist Russian enclave inside Lithuania. I had mentally pictured a ruined place, similar to the evacuated city of Pripyat, next to the Chernobyl reactor. The train pulled up in the middle of deep woods and I stepped out of my carriage. The railway station was far outside the town. The first human being I saw through the window of the taxi was a barefoot, long-haired, massively tattooed man in his mid-30s wearing colourful trousers and beads. Strolling down the alleyway, he looked so out of the ordinary among the Soviet housing blocks that for a moment I thought I was hallucinating. The cab drove through unbelievably wide streets named Cosmos, Festival, Soviet, Youth. I couldn\u2019t see a single private house, only endlessly repetitive grey- and red-brick blocks. Pine trees were everywhere, and the place looked as though it had been frozen in time: not apocalyptic but daydreamy. A few months later I decided to settle in Visaginas. I\u2019d become attached to this time capsule surrounded by lush wilderness. Here in the atomic town I skated on frozen lakes, trekked through icy swamps, warmed up inside cute saunas and fixed my broken bond with mother nature. I found a local yoga teacher, Oksana. She wore long fake lashes and changed the colour of her hair every two months. Sometimes she struggled to translate words from Russian to Lithuanian, and would apologise for that. I quickly noticed how embarrassed young Visaginians were about the language barrier. Eventually Oksana joined the local border patrol school, while her twin brother went to serve in the Lithuanian army. In this secluded \u201clittle republic of Visaginas\u201d, the younger generation felt neither fully Russian nor Lithuanian: their identities were fluid, floating somewhere in between. Residents were highly skilled professionals, proud of having built the town and the plant. They were also disillusioned, angry and misrepresented in the Lithuanian media. One of the biggest online news platforms had described Visaginas as a threat to Lithuania\u2019s security. The headline claimed that the homeland security department had identified an active \u201cdeath battalion\u201d in Visaginas. It subsequently turned out that some adolescent boys had been playing with airguns, wearing old Soviet military uniforms they\u2019d found in their grandparents\u2019 wardrobes. Later, when I started my photography project Post-Nuclear Identity, I realised how wary the town\u2019s inhabitants were of the mass media. Even the local scouts had been labelled a national danger. People were relieved that my medium-format camera didn\u2019t look like \u201cthe ones they use in the press\u201d. Little by little, I started sharing photos and thoughts about life in Visaginas with followers online. The older generation could at least place it on the map, while the younger one hardly knew it existed. When I once invited a young student from Vilnius to visit Visaginas, she answered that she wasn\u2019t sure she could get a visa. That said it all. During the three and a half years I lived there, I worked really hard to put it on Lithuanians\u2019 mental map. Instead of showing my project in one of the capital\u2019s galleries, I decided to invite people to experience Visaginas for themselves. I created an immersive exhibition in one of the town\u2019s Soviet flats. It became a catalyst for local artists to come together and organise an \u201catomic festival\u201d. Hundreds of people came from across the country. They were given guided tours around the town by Alex, the barefoot man I\u2019d seen on my first day. I got to know him as the head of the Point, an artists\u2019 residency where he teaches young people various crafts and nonviolent communication. Visitors could also go rowing with the Olympic champion Jevgenij Shuklin, or tour a nuclear simulator with a specialist explaining the inner workings of the plant. The exhibition was talked about on national TV and prominent radio shows. I could feel perceptions of Visaginas changing: from a nonexistent, abandoned place to something approaching cool. The relationship between Lithuanians and Russians is complex. Lithuania is actually very good at accepting political refugees from Russia, because we know the Kremlin\u2019s tactics well. When a Russian citizen says his house was set on fire after he went to court to sue somebody in power, we don\u2019t ask that person to explain the link. At the same time, Lithuanian society is incredibly homogeneous, as a result of Nazi and Soviet crimes during the second world war. Stereotypes about Russian people being vulgar, tasteless, war-mongering and brainwashed are abundant. Lithuania\u2019s government still mainly pretends that Visaginas isn\u2019t there. But nearby Estonia has chosen a completely different approach to its Russian-speaking minority. Last year the Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid moved her residence and cabinet for several weeks to Narva, a Russian majority town on the border \u2013 visiting all possible institutions and talking to local people. Instead of alienating minorities, you can reach out to them directly and hear their voices. Three and a half years on, my relationship with the man I went to see on that train in 2015 has ended, but my relationship with the atomic town has proven to be long-lasting. We live in an era of fake news and deliberate attempts to divide us from one another. Each one of us can resist that by going where it may seem the most difficult to engage with people \u2013 by being curious about those who at first glance seem so different. \u2022 Neringa Reka\u0161i\u016bt\u0117 is a Lithuanian photographer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
