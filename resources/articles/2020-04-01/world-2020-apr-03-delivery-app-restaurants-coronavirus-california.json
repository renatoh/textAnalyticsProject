And in the food service industry\u2019s crisis, third-party delivery platforms have found great opportunity. As businesses have been forced to close their dining rooms amid shelter-in-place orders, many have attempted a quick pivot to takeout and delivery. Without a physical presence in their customers\u2019 lives, many restaurants\u2019 immediate survival has come to depend on a digital one, shifting power and control from business owners to third-party technology companies that take large commission fees on every order. It has meant a boon for platforms such as UberEats and DoorDash, rare corporate winners in an accelerating unemployment crisis and recession that has decimated food service \u2013 though the apps probably still won\u2019t be enough to keep many small businesses alive. Apps to the rescue \u2013 or profiting from an industry\u2019s collapse? Third-party delivery platforms frame their business as one of marketing. When restaurants still had dining rooms to fill, apps promoted their service as a way of reaching new customers. Now the platforms hold the restaurant market captive, and the apps are more crowded than ever. On the consumer side, the deals look great: UberEats is dropping delivery fees to drive more demand. Grubhub is offering a special \u201cSupper for Support\u201d $10 discount to qualifying customer orders every evening. But restaurants are left to pick up the tab, as Grubhub\u2019s usual commission is still calculated on the pre-discount total. From company to company, those commissions can range from 15% to as high as 35% of order totals. UberEats has waived activation fees for new restaurants, but has declined to reduce commissions. Grubhub has temporarily deferred but not waived or reduced commissions for some independent restaurants. Still, many struggling restaurants have no choice but to give in and sign up. Grubhub reports more than 10 to 15 times the usual onboarding requests from new restaurants, with four to five times more new businesses added to the app on a regular basis. \u201cWe know these are tough times for independent restaurants because people are not eating out. Our mission here is to help keep their doors open,\u201d Grubhub said in a statement. Faced with shutting her doors for the first time in over 20 years, Rachel Herbert, the owner of four Park Cafes across San Francisco and Oakland, took her chances on tech. \u201cThe first place we turned to was the third-party delivery companies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at what we need to do to keep our doors open, we have to remember that 30% of the revenue we\u2019re taking in is going to go to third-party delivery. They\u2019re experiencing a boom. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re grateful for the service. But it sure would be nice if they reduced those fees.\u201d Herbert says sales are down 80% across her cafes, which relied on neighborhood foot traffic. \u201cWe\u2019re not really breaking even, but we\u2019re keeping our doors open, so we\u2019re making enough to pay the people who are working and providing that service for the neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival.\u201d Los Angeles restaurant owner and consultant Adam Weisblatt often tells his clients that third-party delivery is a good tool for short-term cashflow \u2013 but not for profit. \u201cThe delivery fees and service charges from these websites are murder. They\u2019re incredibly high rates,\u201d said Weisblatt. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to profit at all.\u201d Weisblatt has temporarily shuttered his oyster bar, and kept his Thai restaurant Same-Same open for takeout and delivery on several third-party platforms. \u201cWe\u2019re doing quite a bit of delivery and to-go, but that\u2019s always been a significant portion of our business. Still, Same-Same is going to lose money every month \u2013 we just don\u2019t know quite how much yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThese sites live off of restaurants, they need us to survive. But I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been especially supportive of the industry. They\u2019re not proving to be good partners right now,\u201d Weisblatt added. \u201cIt feels like a very shortsighted decision not to be helpful, and that as soon as business returns to normal, people are going to look to really eliminate these things.\u201d Pivoting to survive. But for how long? Some restaurants, many of them totally new to takeout and delivery, have attempted to make that leap already, deciding to go it alone and platform-free. That means keeping more of their profits, but expending more labor along the way, from wrangling orders as they come in to launching new DIY delivery fleets. S+M Vegan relied on catering and regular pop-ups at bars in the Bay Area before the shelter-in-place order took effect. Plans for their brick and mortar, set to open later this summer, have fallen through. Now they have switched to twice-weekly meal pickups from their commercial kitchen. \u201cThe advantage is we can do it by ourselves. Third-party delivery apps are known for being kind of a scam,\u201d said co-owner Marie Chia. \u201cThe most successful restaurants run on a margin of about 6%, so the more people order from you, the more you\u2019re losing money. We don\u2019t need to be giving over 30% of our already very small margins.\u201d With only two owner-operators, S+M is too short-staffed to run delivery orders \u2013 but turning to an app for help is not an option. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to maximize what we can get out of this and the value that we can give to our customers,\u201d said co-owner Shane Stanbridge. \u201cIf we were taking a 15% to 30% chunk out of our margins, we might feel tempted to inflate our prices to make up for it. That\u2019s just so unnecessary.\u201d California\u2019s Alcohol Control Board loosened restrictions on restaurants selling liquor to-go, which has helped fill the gap for some businesses, with the margins on drinks typically wider than on food. Oakland\u2019s Kon-Tiki bar and restaurant began delivery service the day the new rules were announced, doing about half their usual business, said co-owner Matt Reagan. Ultimately he decided against using third-party platforms. The operation has gone old-school, with a menu available online, but orders made over the phone. \u201cWe give people the expectation up front that takeout is your best option \u2013 we can get you delivery but it\u2019s going to be a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like time traveling to 15 years ago and you\u2019re just waiting for your pizza to show up.\u201d For now, it\u2019s enough to pay some bills, and allow Kon-Tiki to hire back some staff. Plans to open another Oakland restaurant, Palmetto, are continuing apace, though with a to-go only grand opening planned for April. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a market there. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big market, it just has to be something,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s a path forward. People are making a conscious effort to support the places that they want to survive.\u201d But as the nation slips deeper into a coronavirus recession, no one knows if consumers will be able to afford to keep up that kind of support \u2013 or if it will be enough to save the industry. In a National Restaurant Association poll of more than 5,000 restaurant owners, 11% said they would probably permanently close in the next 30 days, and 3% reported that they had already closed for good. \u201cWe all want to have the lights on and people employed and be open for the day of the victory parade,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s going to be a lot fewer restaurants when that day comes \u2013 a lot of neighborhood staples that aren\u2019t going to be able to make it through to the end.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
