Mr Haddock, who changed his name by deed poll, hopes his move will give new life to his constituency's struggling fishing industry. The family name change has been kicked off to coincide with a seafood promotion week. \"I thought this would be a fun way of getting some more publicity for the seafood cause\", Mr Haddock told the Times. \"Haddock was a natural choice for my fishy surname. I've been brought up on this great fish and Grimsby's fish market is the best place to get it.\" The father of four added that fishing was the backbone of Grimsby's economy, his Lincolnshire constituency which he has been serving as MP for more than 25 years. His wife Linda, equally enthusiastic, is considering to change her surname to Chips. But for daughter Hannah, the whole affair is just too fishy: \"I think Dad's mad. What will it be next seafood week? Austin Mackerel? Austin Swordfish?\" Hannah and her siblings have all decided to stick with their old family name. The 68-year-old MP is no stranger to the denizen of the deep. As co-founder of Save Britain's Fish campaign and a member of the Commons select committee on the environment, food and rural affairs, he keeps up the fight for Britain's fishermen. The former BBC journalist has even taken his struggle to the world of publishing, with his book Fishermen: the Rise and Fall of Deep Water Trawling shooting up to sales rank 961,716 at Amazon.co.uk. On his website austinmitchell.co.uk, Mr Haddock mourns fishing as \"an industry betrayed at every turn by the British government from both parties, which have sold its interests out in their desire to get into Europe\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
