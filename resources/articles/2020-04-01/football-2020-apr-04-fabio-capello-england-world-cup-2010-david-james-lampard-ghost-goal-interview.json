One of those was England in 2010. It was not particularly memorable but the Italian can\u2019t help it, not when Frank Lampard\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d haunts him even now 10 years on. \u201cEveryone saw it,\u201d Capello says. \u201cBesides, because of the effect on the ball, when it hits the bar, the floor \u2013 the pitch was dry \u2013 and goes up like that, it can only have gone in: it\u2019s physics.\u201d But the goal wasn\u2019t given and rather than drawing level with Germany in the last 16, England still trailed and were soon out. Capello says the decision was \u201chistoric\u201d but it also hurt because he could see it happening. \u201cThere had been a conference in Sun City in February: an hour about the ball, 45 minutes about referees. The preparation was perfect, they said. This, that, the other. And I said to the referees\u2019 chief: \u2018Why not put someone behind the goal, a fifth official?\u2019 \u2018No, we\u2019ve decided this way\u2019\u2026\u201d There is a grin, irony etched on that familiar face. Capello sees himself before the same men four months later. He slaps his hand, hard. \u201cLook! I said this would happen,\u201d he begins. \u201cWe worked for two years and because of someone else\u2019s mistake we\u2019re going home. Because you didn\u2019t put someone there. What\u2019s he sitting in the stands for? Put him behind the goal. It was there! I told them that in February.\u201d True but it does not change the fact that in 2010 England were \u2013 how can we put this? \u2013 not very good. Whatever mistakes the referees made, were not more made by the team and their manager? The catalogue is a long one. Time, then, to go through it, page by painful page. Capello sits on the sofa at Sam Mam\u00e9s in Bilbao, where he\u2019s about to address the Bilbao International Football Summit, and, edging towards a low table, begins. \u201cRooney had problems, he wasn\u2019t right,\u201d he says, a little enigmatically. \u201cBeckham got injured, Ferdinand got injured: important players, with charisma, leadership, players you need. We got there and played without conviction.\u201d The question is simple: why? The answer is complex, a portrait of multiple system failure. Starting with the simple, let\u2019s address the most basic question: why did England go 10 years without finding a good fit for Lampard and Steven Gerrard? \u201cBecause they played in the same place,\u201d Capello says. Why not remove one, then? \u201cBecause the other players aren\u2019t better,\u201d he replies, laughing, swiftly dismissing the suggestion he employed Gerrard on the left. \u201cNo, only when defending: when we had the ball, he was free.\u201d \u201cWhen we played, I didn\u2019t see the same comfort,\u201d Capello continues. \u201cWe played a pre-tournament friendly and I could already see something was missing. Afterwards people said things like we were based too far away [from everything], the players were holed up and didn\u2019t like it, it was too long, too hard. That\u2019s nonsense, stupid. The preparation was perfect.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d he says, which is something he says a lot, \u201cin my life, I played one World Cup: the greatest thing. I used to wait in anticipation for the squad announcement. I didn\u2019t go to Argentina 78 having played throughout qualification. Now, that hurt. Being at a World Cup is a sacrifice? Twenty days is a sacrifice? What about the people there working for the team, up at five every morning? That\u2019s sacrifice. It\u2019s not a sacrifice to play. \u201cPeople said: \u2018They\u2019re not used to it.\u2019 Not used to it! You\u2019re there to work. You have the whole of England behind you. And four years later they were in the centre of Rio and were sent home early too ... so \u2026\u201d So? \u201cThe England shirt weighs heavy,\u201d Capello says. \u201cSo much time has passed without winning. \u201966 is a problem because whenever a World Cup or Euros starts, they think they can do it again. Always, always, always. It\u2019s important to play without that weight, with more freedom. A lot is psychology but, honestly, I think the problem England have is they arrive at tournaments tired. \u201cIn September, October, November, we had no problem playing the world\u2019s best teams. In March, April, so-so. In June, problems. That\u2019s why I think it is physical. You play a lot of [club] games and your culture is: fight, fight, fight, never stop, even if you\u2019re four down. I liked that.\u201d And yet, Capello thinks, it costs. Not that it was the only factor and he believes it is different for Gareth Southgate. \u201cMy team was a bit old. We didn\u2019t have young players and in the past there was tiredness. Now they have good young players. Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling are important. There\u2019s quality, speed, everything. If I have a doubt now, it\u2019s the centre-backs but England have lads who are younger, fresher.\u201d \u201cYou also need confidence and England have that now,\u201d he continues, pausing to add with a wry smile: \u201cNow they have a goalkeeper \u2026\u201d You didn\u2019t? \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve always had bad luck with goalkeepers internationally. The goalkeeper is very, very important, as much as a striker. Anyone who wants to win a title has to have a goalkeeper.\u201d In South Africa, Capello had Rob Green, who let a harmless Clint Dempsey long shot slip under his body against USA. Green later talked about a culture of fear, a lack of communication. At its most basic level, that is a recurring theme of Capello\u2019s era, it is also an accusation he dismisses, if not always entirely convincingly. \u201cPeople said the players didn\u2019t understand my English but it\u2019s football: 20 words [are enough],\u201d he says. He says so in Spanish, incidentally. Communication was no problem, then? \u201cNo, absolutely not. It was in Russia and China, but not England.\u201d Few words were spent on dropping Green, certainly: Capello told him he was out and the conversation ended there. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything. Everyone makes mistakes. He made one, so I changed. I put in Calamity James.\u201d Yes, that is how he refers to David James \u2013 without missing a beat. \u201cI had Green and I had [Joe] Hart, just a kid. I asked the players. Hart or Calamity? \u2018Calamity.\u2019 I put Calamity in because of the players\u2019 trust. John Terry and the defenders had more faith in James. Hart had played only once.\u201d Green also claimed Capello had fat-shamed the squad, telling three-quarters of them they were overweight. Also true, Capello concedes, spreading his hands. \u201cThey came like this. You explain, tell them what to do. They\u2019re professionals. The problem is, they arrive at the end of the season. \u2018We\u2019re used to eating this, used to doing this, not used to that.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to change \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t have leaders [among players] to guide them.\u201d In part, though, that was precisely what Capello had come for, chosen as a corrective to perceived lax discipline under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, a break from Baden-Baden. \u201cIt\u2019s not discipline,\u201d Capello insists. \u201cIt\u2019s respect for the shirt: you represent a country. You\u2019re not there for fun; you\u2019re there to work, for the game, for English spirit. At a club you might need [a warmer, closer relationship] but not a national team. There\u2019s the maximum respect. We\u2019re focused to the target and that\u2019s it.\u201d That last line is the only one delivered in English. \u201cAll that stuff is nonsense, always has been,\u201d Capello concludes. \u201cLook, one thing I do think,\u201d he says, after a short pause. \u201cIn the first game against USA, it\u2019s a gift from Green. In the second game [England 0 Algeria 0], we played so-so. The third game, Slovenia [a 1-0 win] \u2026 I almost don\u2019t remember it \u2026 and then there\u2019s the last one against Germany and \u2026\u201d And? \u201cThere is something very important, something that whenever I think about it still lingers here,\u201d he says, pointing to his head. \u201cGermany was a young team, very young. Listen: a young team that goes from 2-0 to 2-2 has a psychological problem. For us, that\u2019s a tremendous boost. But that wasn\u2019t to be [because Lampard\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t given] and I can\u2019t get it out of my mind. It\u2019s still there, still there. I would have liked to see the second half then. We hit the bar, had chances, and on the break they score the third, then a fourth. I could see it: we were growing, getting better, and then \u2026\u201d And then Capello stops and slaps his hands together and it\u2019s all over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
