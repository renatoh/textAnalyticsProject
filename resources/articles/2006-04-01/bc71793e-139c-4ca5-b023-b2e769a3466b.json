All voters see much-needed funding go with a fanfare to a school or clinic; many, many fewer note Gordon Brown stealing off with the same amount reduced from his tax bill. The rot is not universal among the lottery distributors, however, as the Heritage Lottery Fund persistently shows with imaginative projects which really are the sort of \"extras\" envisaged when the weekly gamble was born. One such is the \u00a3800,000 just granted to the National Moth Recording Scheme which will do far more than plot the nation's remaining stock of Setaceous Hebrew Character moths or Angle Prominents. Moths and butterflies may be the very symbol of idle frittering or covert decay but their enthusiasts have made an even greater contribution to human welfare than the NHS. The immortal examples are Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Much more recently Sir Cyril Clarke made central discoveries about rhesus negative \"blue babies\" and longevity and pollution through his expertise on the Peppered moth and breeding Swallowtail butterflies. His interest was kindled during boyhood night watches as the moths fluttered in to his garden lamp. The grant will seed potential successors; a paradigm of original education and health promotion well beyond Whitehall's wit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
