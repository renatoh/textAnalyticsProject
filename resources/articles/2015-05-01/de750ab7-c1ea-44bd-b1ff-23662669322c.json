In one corner, we had three parties and three ultimately very human leaders that were, had we but known it, destined for speedy morning meltdown. In the other, three of the sharpest brains on these islands \u2013 Jeremy Paxman, David Mitchell, Richard Osman \u2013 queueing up, armed only with quicksilver wit and five years of frustration against spin, blithering and obfuscation, in C4\u2019s Alternative Election Night. But, as the televisual night wore on, I found myself almost cringing in hindsight at, say, Paxo\u2019s earlier (pre-midnight, post-exit poll) throwaway jibe about the Lib Dem parliamentary caucus being able to fit into a taxi. And at the splendid Ballot Monkeys, another C4 production written by the beautifully cynical Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin, which ran most of the week, and was screamingly funny. But, again utterly in hindsight, it was too cruel, had been too true: from Ben Miller\u2019s inspired long dark teatimes of the soul on the Lib Dem bus, to Hugh Dennis\u2019s cynical Tory with the gibberingly pitch-perfect bitterness over Boris, to the woeful faffing and mixed-message misery on the Milibus. And we rightly treasure these writers and performers, their urgent wit being seldom more necessary than in the coming years, though some of Paxo\u2019s (scripted) jokes were sub-dire. It\u2019s just that\u2026 as the night unfurled, it became remembered-clear that necessary satire hits living breathing human beings, full of blood and sentiment and humour. (I\u2019m excluding Osborne, obviously). Even the most partisan SNP chief must have felt a slight pang at Charlie Kennedy\u2019s destruction, or Jim Murphy\u2019s eloquence (\u201cDon\u2019t waste a new morning\u2026 \u201d); even Ed Balls extended sublime graciousness towards his bester. The BBC\u2019s David Dimbleby, perhaps more than the anchors on any other channel, was early to acknowledge much of this, calling Murphy, for instance, \u201ca model of courtesy and dignity\u201d: this was Dimbers\u2019s last ever full-on election night, hence possibly an inherent empathy towards the cyclical Nature of Things. As he called it a day at 7am, to be replaced by the scary Huw Edwards, who would manage to sound cheesily bored were he breaking news of the Pope landing on Mars, there were sweet smiles around the table and, I\u2019m convinced, a smattering of muted applause from the knackered camera crews. The BBC, overall, did rather well. Not just Dimbers but also an indefatigable Andy Marr, the winningly tricksy Andrew Neil, always on the verge of laughter at the sheer ridiculousness of life and/or himself; and Laura Kuenssberg, also very funny, not least when she instantly and gigglingly defined Nigel Farage\u2019s clifftop resignation/rerun \u201cyeah but no but yeah\u201d announcement as his Vicky Pollard moment. But even Farage, after his minor C4 meltdown moment, managed to pack dignity into his morning farewell, as of course did Messrs Clegg and Miliband. As could be said of all three, with a certain serendipity because a certain Scottish play is involved, nothing in his life became him like the leaving of it. Julie Etchingham, across on ITV, who had performed with such commanding panache in the first leaders\u2019 interview, was sadly ill-served by thunderously confusing graphics which, from what I could make out, were predicting forthcoming Bloomsberg-index sales of frozen OJ or Peruvian nose-flutes. Across on BBC1, the ever faintly irritatingly Jeremy Vine only had to cope with a pretend tiled snake running up a dark street, and an ersatz House of Commons which, for all its artists\u2019 sterling attempts to render individual MPs\u2019 features as those of semi-sentient droids, insert joke of choice, never quite panned back far enough from Vine\u2019s arm-waving to show you the bloody finishing line. There was also a tedious clock thing: but Laura, and ITV\u2019s Julie, and Sky (simpler graphics, whew; nanosecond faster updates, who cares?), and Sophie Raworth had all earlier explained cleverly, and in words of one syllable, how the swing \u2013 39% from Labour to SNP, in one unprecedented Glasgow moment \u2013 had knocked the socks off even that Portillo moment (17%). The perhaps over-rich Beeb only let itself down in deciding, presumably in a sleep-deprived producer\u2019s understandable necessity to flee Huw\u2019s monotone, to focus for a full two minutes on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s plane coming in to land at City airport. Did they have a\u2026 dirigible blimp-cam, set up solely for that long moment? Are we paying for that? (Yes). As ever, the rewarding money shots, from all broadcasters, came courtesy not of tawdry silly-coffer budgets but from relatively cheap cameras on the ground. The moment when Ed cracked his first unscripted \u201cMilifandom\u201d joke, freed from the shackles of an American spinmeister and allowed to be, for possibly the first time since entering politics, a flawed and funny man, and the deserved shouts of applause during his tribute to the legions of weary footsloggers. The moment when, in the ICA, Mr Clegg\u2019s so-timely defence of liberalism, and the apposite quote from Alex Cole-Hamilton, was moving many in the room to rough tears. Farage\u2019s tears might well have been blown sideways on that Margate clifftop, but the palpable human delight as he said \u201chuge weight lifted off my shoulders\u201d should have been cheered by even the most tight-bottomed and Pecksniffian of Ukip-begrudgers. And the slow shots around the Cenotaph: the three leaders looking, finally, normal, becalmed, clever, sombre: goodness, you might almost dare think of them as once and future friends. On election night 1997, I accompanied one T Blair on another flight south, from Sedgefield into that gilded dawn. Against some wise advice, I concluded my subsequent article with the words: \u201cWhat a win. What a chance for change. But things can only get bitter.\u201d Quite how bitter, quite how slowly savage the myriad knock-on effects of the levers pulled back then, only finally became unconscionably clear on this other Friday May morning, 18 years on. Television, and technology, have now moved on faster than at any time since the juncture between the Ark and self-service tills, ie both hugely, and not at all. But, for all I\u2019m still smiling at the meme which portrays a yellow-blue map of new Britain as Maggie Simpson, it\u2019s the same old story: new tech can blitz and whizz, but old-fashioned human politicking, down and dirty or musical and hopeful, will get you in the back of the knees every time. WERE THEY ALL RIGHT ON THE NIGHT? Julie Etchingham Despite a visually strange desk set-up, and some strange IT work, she re-established herself as heir apparent to David Dimbleby, if not the once-sainted Paxo. On top of everything, dusk till dawn. But an exceedingly close runner-up was Laura Kuenssberg, a constant gift of fresh air. Andrew Marr The Duracell bunny of Friday. Health problems apparently discarded, he was by turns caustic, kind, funny, niggling and sagaciously jug-eared. Peter Kellner Lovely Peter, formerly of this parish, was somewhat blown about by the exit count, which retrospectively rendered all his YouGov polls as much use as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest. He politely took umbrage-by-proxy with the strange man-rabbit John Curtice, who was busy being proved almost entirely right. Near dawn, two-thirds through the counts, Peter came out with a honest and wistful \u201cAh. If only the polls could stay exactly like this\u201d. He\u2019d be a winningly more analytical presenter elsewhere in the year to replace, say, Nick Hewer and that nasty Margaret Mountford. Nicholas Witchell No, that was just our attempt at humour. Richard Osman Nailed C4\u2019s election-night coverage with a now-trademark mix of wit, empathy, banter, decentness, learnedness, trivia and, occasionally, quite, quite unassailable rudeness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
