About 90 tech workers who are employed by the Indian outsourcing firm HCL America, but work on Google projects at Google\u2019s offices, will form a union with the United Steel Workers (USW), a labor union born in Pittsburgh. The vote to unionize passed with 49 voting in favor of unionization and 24 voting against. The group of tech workers will organize under the name Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals (PATP). The newly unionized workers are just a small portion of the temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs) who make up an enormous \u201cshadow\u201d workforce at Google, outnumbering direct Google employees by around 135,000 to 115,000. Contractors who spoke recently with the Guardian have complained of low pay, stingy time off, a lack of responsiveness from management and a constant sense of precariousness. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that from one Monday to the next we will have a job. It feels like being on the edge of a cliff all the time,\u201d said Josh Borden, who has worked for HCL for three and a half years. Thomas M Conway, the president of USW International, said in a statement that he was \u201chonored that HCL workers chose to join our union and our fight on behalf of all working people. They deserve to have their voices heard. Together, we\u2019ll make sure that they are.\u201d The union drive began in early 2019 when one HCL contractor, Ben Gwin, contacted the USW to see if the union could help. He was not alone in experiencing frustrations with his employer. \u201cFrom the time I was hired until now, me and my colleagues have been asking for certain things, like a couple extra vacation days, a better healthcare plan, more pay sometimes,\u201d another HCL worker, Johanne Rokholt, told the Guardian. \u201cThe answer is always, \u2018We\u2019re doing as much as we can \u2026 You are lucky and you should feel grateful.\u2019 It\u2019s a one-sided conversation and I would like to see it be a dialogue.\u201d The idea of unionization found fertile ground among workers who were surrounded every day by reminders of how much better Googlers had it than they did. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a party happening and some people have to watch it and not come in,\u201d one Pittsburgh Googler told the Guardian. The workers voted in favor of unionizing despite attempts by HCL to prevent it, Vice reports. Emails shared with the news outlet show that HCL America\u2019s deputy general manager of operations sent at least a half-dozen emails to contractors in the two-week period before the vote in an apparent effort to urge employees not to unionize. \u201cThe Steelworkers are typically \u2018blue collar\u2019 workers, not workers in a tech industry like us, and the overwhelming majority of the contracts they\u2019ve negotiated are for employees working in industries completely unrelated to ours,\u201d one of the emails reportedly read. \u201cDo you really think the Steelworkers understand our needs, our industry, our business, or even what you do on a daily basis? I don\u2019t.\u201d That the contracted workers work on Google\u2019s core projects but are not deemed crucial enough to be hired as direct Google employees \u201cexposes the contradiction\u201d in Silicon Valley\u2019s major philanthropic endeavors, Alex Wallach Hanson, an organizer with community group Pittsburgh United, told the Guardian. \u201cThey dedicate all their philanthropy to telling particularly black and brown students that they need to learn to code and then they can achieve what tech workers are getting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not actually creating those pathways [to direct employment].\u201d In a statement, HCL worker Joshua Borden said the tech workers in Pittsburg \u201cdeserve more respect, dignity and democracy in our relationship with our employer\u201d, and that Tuesday\u2019s vote represents a step forward. \u201cWe fought for a seat at the table, and today we won. We look forward to bargaining a contract that reflects our important contributions to HCL\u2019s continuing success.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
