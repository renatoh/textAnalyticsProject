The Australian poet and scholar Christopher Brennan was a Dublin brewer\u2019s son, born in Sydney in 1870. His parents, both Irish, had emigrated to Australia during the 1860s. An unusually gifted but far from conformist student, he studied classics at Sydney University, and then won a scholarship to the University of Berlin. His encounter with the poetry of the French symbolist St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 was a formative one. And he received high praise from Mallarm\u00e9, to whom he sent his first collection (\u201cPoet, wonderful Poet!\u201d). The Wanderer, a 14-part cycle mostly written during 1901, is his major achievement. The relatively large-scale structure allows him unity and control. Some symbolist principles, such as the tenet that art should avoid naturalism and \u201ccapture absolute truth by indirect means\u201d seem minimally significant. German Romanticism contributes more to the personal intensity of the solitary winter journey as it unfolds. Commentators have also pointed to the influence of Australian poets, particularly that of Henry Kendall \u2013 influences too easily overlooked in the emphasis on Brennan\u2019s European heritage. I\u2019ve chosen the last section but, as all too often, the excerpt offers only a glimpse into the nature, and stature, of the whole work. The land described at the start of this excerpt is not only a place but a ghost, suggesting it represents a lost arena of self. The term \u201cwreck\u201d covers a devastation both cosmic and historical: \u201cwreck of constellations flicker\u2019d perishing / scarce sustained in the mortuary air, / and on the ground and out of livid pools / wreck of old swords and crowns glimmer\u2019d at whiles \u2026\u201d Notwithstanding the reference to limbo, Brennan\u2019s diction is genuinely Miltonic. He makes the darkness visible, and finds appropriate symbols gleaming in the ruins. \u201cI seem\u2019d at home in some old dream of kingship\u201d is a brilliant line, though a prelude to the movement out of the dreamscape into bleakly rational dawn: \u201cnow it is clear grey day and the road is plain, / I am the wanderer of many years / who cannot tell if ever he was king / or if ever kingdoms were.\u201d Brennan brings together the different registers seamlessly. Magisterial rather than melodramatic, but not over-magisterial, his blank verse is metrically relaxed but tight enough to sing. Characterised now as \u201cthe wanderer of the ways of all the worlds\u201d, the narrator sees that this multiplicity of possible directions cancels them all out. The figures of psychological and physical opposition are erased: sun and rain, progress and stasis, night and day are existentially merged. The vision of \u201csoft fire and delicious death\u201d is the Edenic alternative, a consolation expressed with moving directness: \u201cand saying this to myself as a simple thing / I feel a peace fall in the heart of the winds / and a clear dusk settle, somewhere, far in me.\u201d Brennan, who died in 1932, was born on 1 November 150 years ago. The anniversary deserves celebration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
