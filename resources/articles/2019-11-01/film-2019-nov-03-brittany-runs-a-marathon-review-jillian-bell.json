The 28-year-old is 5ft 6in, 13st 8lb and medically overweight. \u201cI feel like you completely missed the point of those Dove ads,\u201d she drolly tells him. In writer-director Paul Downs Colaizzo\u2019s indie comedy, based on one of his friends, Brittany is spurred by this humiliating encounter into getting fit and training for a marathon. She laces up her trainers; the proudly plus-size popstar Lizzo\u2019s empowerment anthem Good as Hell plays over the ensuing weight-loss montage. It\u2019s a red flag. The film struggles to square its protagonist\u2019s weight loss with the pressure to present a body-positive position and ensure it doesn\u2019t alienate the very female audience it courts. One minute it\u2019s wryly poking fun at the expense and inaccessibility of gyms, the next it\u2019s fetishistically cataloguing the shrinking number on Brittany\u2019s scales. Indeed, as her body transforms, so does her life. She finds a new job, and supportive friends in her running club; men begin to notice her. Yet Brittany still battles with her body issues, unable to shed her identity as \u201ca fat girl\u201d. There\u2019s a note of truth in Bell\u2019s finely tuned performance as a character whose insecurities have calcified over the years, hardening her to genuine goodwill, which she frequently misreads as pity. However, a feelgood fairytale ending wraps up Brittany\u2019s story a little too neatly, with Colaizzo insistent on giving the audience a runner\u2019s high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
