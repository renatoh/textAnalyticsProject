In Downing Street, and across the world, a coalition of the aghast will gather to demand action from their leaders. Or at least a bit of attention. Wake up in the back row. The worst humanitarian crisis on the planet is on the tipping point of massacre and almost no one has been paying heed. It is a paradox that, in an age shadowed by a dread of terror, people are sanguine when the real thing comes along. Or maybe western Sudan has become a cliche, a brand leader of calamity. Darfur is always suffering, in the way that Skegness is permanently bracing. This time, things are different. The African Union's 7,000 peacekeepers, feeble, underfunded and unwelcome, are leaving in a fortnight. Sudan's leader, Omar al-Bashir, refuses to accept the 20,000 replacement force mandated by the United Nations. The resulting security vacuum would force out aid workers, condemning to death many of the 2.5 million who depend on them. It would also let Bashir unleash a military solution to a three-year conflict that has killed 300,000 people and left 2 million homeless; 10,000 Sudanese troops are massing to take on the rebels. So the scene is set for the 'first genocide of the 21st century,' according to actor George Clooney, who told the UN last week that, if the blue berets are not in place by 1 October, they will not be required. 'You will simply need men with shovels and bleached linen and headstones,' he said. I don't recall much demand, when I was in western Sudan, for tombstones or starched shrouds. Death was too common for such formalities. Perhaps the women who held out their babies and asked us to take their pictures believed the world would see their fate and send more help. Or maybe they just wanted a memorial. In lieu of marble, a snapshot in some newspaper archive would testify that these children had ever lived. Years on, I have never seen a more terrible example of the pointlessness of life and death. But the 'food gap', as Bashir's lieutenants euphemistically put it then, was only a prelude. Glenys Kinnock, with whom I travelled, has been back often. Each time, she says, the indescribable gets worse. The women still say: 'Don't leave us' and the exodus continues. Aid agencies are already pulling out, food supplies are drying up and the AU peacekeepers offer scant protection. Women venturing out of refugee camps for firewood are routinely raped. Many hopes, not least those of Tony Blair, were invested in a peace deal ratified in May by the Khartoum government. That pact is now in shreds and the one rebel group to sign up has signalled a return to combat if the AU goes. There is no peace, no ceasefire and no end to the killings in a complex war. The conflict never quite fitted the usual, simplistic portrayal of a feud between rebel and government, African and Arab, good and evil. Rebels also have blood on their hands, and Arabs and non-Arabs, all indigenous, black and African, fit no neat boxes. But there is no disputing the vile record of Bashir's troops and their proxies, the janjaweed militia. Both seem poised for butchery unparalleled even in Darfur. Tony Blair has had an anxious week. Yesterday, he issued a statement calling the situation 'completely unacceptable' and promising to put pressure on world leaders who have failed to do enough. Already, he has had words with Premier Wen of China. On Wednesday, he phoned George W Bush to discuss 'carrots and sticks' for Khartoum. Sudan, he says, stays 'at the top of my agenda'. Darfur-watchers would like to know exactly how tough he was with China, which refused, with Russia and Qatar, to back the Security Council resolution calling for UN peacekeepers to move in. Did Mr Blair tell Wen that his thirst for Sudan's oil risked making him complicit in genocide? I doubt it. Downing Street sources report slow progress on the Chinese front and time runs out. Bashir is known to crumble under pressure. In its absence, he mocks the world. Perhaps threats (more sanctions) and blandishments (more aid and debt relief) will suffice. Perhaps the African Union will cobble up a deal, when it meets tomorrow, to keep its clapped-out peace force in place for a little longer. But there is now the spectre of a reprise of Rwanda and of death on such an extravagant scale that the world cannot stand by. The point of armed intervention is not here yet, but it might be. Once, only all-out ethnic cleansing obliged the international community to act. Now the semantics of genocide have been superseded. A year ago today, the UN pledged to act against regimes that failed to protect their citizens. That does not necessarily imply a Chapter Seven resolution and military action, but it does lower the gold standard of intervention. Darfur is the test case. Invasion is the final, and unloveliest, resort. The janjaweed has grown from 500 to 200,000 in two decades and occupying armies have no recent record of securing peace. But, at the least, Bashir must know that, in extremis, the world would not offer imprimaturs to a bloodbath. Once, the Prime Minister would have been the first evangelist for such a mission. No doubt he secretly still is. Those close to Downing Street do not rule out the need for armed force if catastrophe hits Darfur. But how, Blair must wonder privately, could Britain muster more troops? How could Nato, when it can barely scratch together a back-up force in Afghanistan? Would the US conceivably weigh in, as it did when Europe - and UN peacekeepers - failed to stop genocide in the Balkans? And how would he ever sell a war against a Muslim regime to an Arab League that detests his foreign policy? No wonder he will be pouring all his efforts into choreographing an international response that will save Darfur from meltdown. For that to happen, Bashir will have to drop his UN veto, the rebels will all have to sign up for peace and the AU troops will need extra time and money. But all that presupposes two things. The first is that Russia and China stop indulging Bashir in his assertion that he holds sovereign sway over his people's lives. The second is that a world that has grown obsessive over the safety of well-protected citizens clamours for the protection of those who think themselves fortunate to have survived another day. Diplomacy is still the last best chance, though it will have to get much tougher. UN credibility depends on a solution and so do countless lives. When I think of Sudan, I remember best a boy of nine. He was feeding gruel to an infant brother before swallowing his own portion and loping down the road with the baby bouncing on his skeletal hip. There was nothing to mark him out, except a look of optimism in a country parched of all sustenance, including dreams. Blair wants, commendably, to be the custodian of hope. As Plan A, he will urge world leaders to force Bashir to step back from the brink of genocide. Any Plan B got shredded and cast to the winds somewhere between Baghdad and Helmand province. What bitter irony it would be if the consequence of Bush and Blair's adventurism was an inability to mount a wholly legitimate war on terror. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
