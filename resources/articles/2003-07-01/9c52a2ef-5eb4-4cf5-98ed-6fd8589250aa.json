The All Blacks arrived at the 1995 and 1999 World Cup tournaments as the form team capable of playing devastating rugby - only for their plans to go awry. On Saturday they played outstanding rugby and will again be one of the favourites going into the autumn's tournament. But their coach and captain barely cracked a smile in the wake of this sublime performance. It was easy to work out the reasons: the counting of unhatched chickens took a blow in the 1995 final and went right out of fashion following the 1999 semi-final against France. The other reason is that outclassing the Springboks is really nothing to write home about these days. New Zealanders themselves will not allow their private hopes to burgeon until they reclaim the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 1997. They play Australia in Sydney on Saturday and need to win that game and the concluding Tri-Nations match in Auckland on August 16 to get a particularly noisome monkey off their back. As impressive as this performance was, it will count for nothing if they contrive to leave trans-Tasman bragging rights in Wallaby hands for a seventh successive season. \"We have got Australia next week and in this professional game your reputation only really survives one week,\" said a carefully downbeat All Black coach John Mitchell. The memories of their evisceration at the hands of the All Black backs will last far longer than that in South African memories, although it is a sad fact for home supporters that this kind of reverse is becoming alarmingly commonplace. The Springbok coach Rudolf Straeuli made the usual noises about bouncing back and not panicking, without realising that Springbok followers are beyond panic and have settled into a numbed despair. This defeat was South Africa's second heaviest anywhere; it was the first time they have conceded a half-century at home and comes only five matches after conceding 53 points to England at Twickenham. Here they foolishly tried to run the ball, and four of the All Blacks' seven tries came directly from clinically exploiting Springbok mistakes. Three of them arrived in the space of 15 first-half minutes, popping the bubble of optimism created by the previous Saturday's 26-22 victory over Australia in Cape Town. Carlos Spencer, the Kiwis' chief architect at fly-half, flicked the ball left and right, bewildering a Springbok backline that was so confused that its members were often unable to lay a hand on a black jersey. When the Springbok captain Corne Krige was asked if it was the best backline he had ever faced, he replied that it was made to look the best by poor defending. But there was no denying the scorching pace and incisiveness of the wings Joe Rokocoko and Doug Howlett, who each claimed a brace of tries. Howlett also had the key hand in the seventh and best, started from first-phase possession in their own 22, when he looped off his blindside flank to create the space for the centre Aaron Mauger to scamper in untouched from the halfway line. \"We showed that when we do have a very good platform, we have a lot of attacking threats,\" said Mitchell. All they need now is the Bledisloe Cup to prove it.
