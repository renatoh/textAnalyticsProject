Staff representatives from the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) and union officials met on Tuesday morning after Guardian Australia and Media Watch reported the Adani spokeswoman Kate Campbell made a direct call to Morris to complain about a story before it aired. The radio story, which had been commissioned for Saturday AM, was pulled from the run-down hours later. The ABC said later this was done to give Adani more time to respond. \u201cWe invite ABC News director Gaven Morris to front news floor staff today to address these allegations and any other questions from staff on the floor,\u201d union delegates said in a statement. \u201cABC MEAA members stand with ABC journalist Isobel Roe, whose story on Adani appears to have been pulled, and we reaffirm the commitment of all ABC journalists to the editorial independence of the ABC and to upholding our ability to do our job without fear or favour.\u201d The media union said ABC management \u201cmust defend the public broadcaster from editorial interference, be it political or corporate, and uphold the obligations of the ABC charter\u201d. The ABC maintains it did not broadcast the story about Adani for legitimate editorial reasons and has not responded directly to the union statement. Guardian Australia understands Morris is in Canberra on Tuesday and is unable to meet with union delegates. \u201cThere was no complaint,\u201d an ABC spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe only communication we received from Adani was a request for more time to respond to our questions. \u201cIn light of the need to provide parties with a fair opportunity to respond and the strength of the other stories in the mix for Saturday AM, the decision was taken at an editorial level to not proceed with the story.\u201d Concern was also raised by the union about revelations in Guardian Australia last week that Adani had lodged several Freedom of Information requests about ABC journalists who had covered the controversial Indian mining company. The ABC\u2019s Queensland-based investigative reporter Josh Robertson referred to the Adani FOI application in an earlier ABC report about the company\u2019s aggressive legal approach to opponents, through its lawyers AJ &amp; Co. \u201cSince it was engaged by Adani, AJ &amp; Co has pushed to bankrupt a cash-strapped Indigenous opponent of the mine, threatened legal action against a community legal service and an environmental group, and applied to access an ABC journalist\u2019s expenses and documents,\u201d Robertson reported. Reporters Mark Willacy and Michael Slezak were asked for documents relating to news reports on allegations Adani was illegally drilling bore holes. These requests were made by AJ &amp; Co, a legal firm acting for Adani which refers to itself as a \u201ctrained attack dog\u201d. Willacy and Slezak\u2019s travel and accommodation costs and some heavily redacted phone logs were released but the majority of the application was rejected. The MEAA media director, Katelin McInerney, said she was alarmed by attempts to access journalists\u2019 records. \u201cThis is a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass journalists going about their duties to report legitimate news stories in the public interest,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cAttacks on press freedom must not be tolerated in a healthy functioning democracy \u2013 regardless of whether those assaults come from political interests or powerful corporations seeking to deter legitimate scrutiny of their activities. \u201cABC journalists must be given the backing and support of ABC management to continue doing their job and fulfilling their responsibilities to keep their audience informed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
