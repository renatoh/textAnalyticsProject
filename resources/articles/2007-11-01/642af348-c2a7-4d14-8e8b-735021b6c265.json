Well, you don't. Everything you know about scarves is wrong, because this season scarves have nothing to do with neck warmth and everything to do with the fact that the Balenciaga catwalk starred a fringed, embroidered, keffiyeh-styled scarf that's on sale for a little less than \u00a33,000. Yes, \u00a33,000. For a scarf. Now, if you actually own this scarf, you have bought yourself the right to wear it with your dressing gown all winter, if you so wish, secure in the knowledge that you're untouchable in your fabulousness. But the rest of us will have to use our sartorial ingenuity to convey the message that our choice of neckwear is practical and phenomenally hip. This is made all the more tricky since, I suspect, some readers will go all lily-livered and culturally squeamish on me at the notion of adopting the traditional Palestinian keffiyeh style - or, as Topshop has cheerfully rebranded it, the Tablecloth Scarf - simply to be on-trend. Happily, Balenciaga has also decreed that it is acceptable to wear thick, stripy, collegiate-style scarves, so you can wear one of those instead. Having got the right scarf, please try not to ruin it by wearing it the wrong way. The doubled-over-and-looped-through technique is no longer an option unless you are a French exchange student. The tucked-under-the-lapels technique suggests that you're concerned about draughts. The authentic catwalk look is triangle-fronted, like a baby in a bib. It looks slightly less ridiculous if you leave a gap at your neck, to avoid the Desperate Dan effect. But, to be honest, if it cost three grand, you probably want to wind it as tight as possible. Oh, and try not to leave it on the bus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
