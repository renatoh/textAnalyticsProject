Marinos have for some time been pursuing Nakamura, whose contract expires this summer, and reportedly wanted to buy him in January but were prevented from doing so because of financial problems at their club sponsor, Nissan. Nakamura, above, has previously expressed his desire to end his career in Japan, which he left seven years ago to join the Italian side Reggina. Marinos' president, Masaharu Saito, yesterday confirmed that he had made the offer for the 30-year-old. Meanwhile, the agent of Marc Janko says the 6ft 5in Salzburg striker will hold talks about joining Celtic next week, having first met Gordon Strachan in January. \"Marc remains open to the idea of Celtic,\" Georg Stangassinger said. \"Tottenham have had him watched recently but we're still more in contact with Celtic than any other club.\" One player who looks set to complete a move to Parkhead is the 22-year-old American goalkeeper Dominic Cervi, who has successfully applied for an Italian passport. He said: \"Once everything is wrapped up, I will head back to Glasgow to finalise that deal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
