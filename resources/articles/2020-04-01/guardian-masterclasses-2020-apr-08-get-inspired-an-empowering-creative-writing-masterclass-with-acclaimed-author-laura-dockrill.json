But you can sign up to our mailing list to be the first to hear when we announce new classes. Where creativity is concerned, the new normal of lockdown may seem to stunt our ability to find inspiration, but this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Rather than using your freed-up time to scroll endlessly or stare at the TV screen, why not carve out some space to get started on the creative writing you\u2019ve always wanted to do? Whether you are a parent wanting to entertain children with inventive stories, a sixth form student with a desire to reconnect with your imagination, a writer looking to refresh your practice or an employee in need of some headspace away from a stressful job, this afternoon class with award-winning author Laura Dockrill will give you the tools for inventing compelling characters, fully-realised scenes and enticing plotlines. This is an opportunity to dust off that first draft you\u2019ve shelved, or return to that plotline you jotted down months ago. Over two hours, and in a supportive environment, you will learn how to find the beautiful in the mundane and turn it into a story, as well as how to rediscover your motivation when you feel anything but. All experiences welcome. Please note that this course will be hosted online. Places are extremely limited and will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.
