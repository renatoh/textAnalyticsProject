The Australian international goalkeeper signed a 3-year deal at Stamford Bridge after rejecting the overtures of Monaco and loan deals with Napoli and Celtic. \"Things did not work out at United so it is a great honour to be given this chance,\" Bosnich said last night. \"My ambition now is to win the title with Chelsea.\" It brings to an end a turbulent 18-month spell in which Bosnich collected a championship winners' medal but made only 35 appearances for the club before suffering the indignity of being ostracised by Sir Alex Ferguson this season. Though United went through the formalities of issuing a statement to wish Bosnich well yesterday, their manager had made no secret of his dislike of the 29-year-old and had effectively demoted him to fourth-choice goalkeeper. He has been critical of Bosnich's attitude and was so incensed by his weight problems last season that their relationship deteriorated to the point where they barely spoke for months. The first problems, however, date back to June 1999 when Bosnich was unveiled at Old Trafford and Ferguson chose not to attend. Further strains soon became apparent when two months later Ferguson signed Massimo Taibi for \u00a34.5m from Venezia. Although the Italian's lamentable United career was soon brought to a close, Bosnich never won over Ferguson and the manager signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for \u00a37.8m last summer. Bosnich was keen to fight for a place but it became apparent that not only did he have Barthez to displace, but also Raimond van der Gouw and the 19-year-old Paul Rachubka. He is also acutely aware that Australia's coach Frank Farina has been increasingly concerned by his lack of first-team action and that his international place is under threat from Boro's Mark Schwarzer. \"Mark will be concentrating on getting back to full match fitness after his recent hernia operation,\" Bosnich's agent Steve Kutner said last night. Bosnich met the Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri and the goalkeeping coach Giorgio Pellizarro after their managing director Colin Hutchinson was made aware of Monaco's interest. \"Finalising the deal took only a few minutes,\" said Hutchinson. \"Mark wants to play for Chelsea and is hungry to win things. He wants to put the past behind him and he has a few points to prove.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
