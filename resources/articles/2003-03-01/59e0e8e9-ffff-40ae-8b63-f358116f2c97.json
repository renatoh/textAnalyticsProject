It is OK to hate referees after all. According to the British Psychological Society, referees exhibit anti-social tendencies that would be frowned upon in polite society but which make them uniquely suited to the job. They suffer, apparently, from \"illusory superiority\", which means they think they know better than everyone else, even their fellow referees. \"Illusory superiority denotes an odd group of people,\" said Dr Nick Neave of Northumbria University, who today presents a paper on referees to the society's annual conference in Bournemouth. \"Most people show it to some extent but all referees do. It is the sort of thing you would expect to find in traffic wardens and politicians.\" Some 42 referees outside the Premiership were asked to fill in forms immediately before and after games. Despite the verbal and even physical abuse received from fans and players, they emerged unstressed. \"They tend to externalise everything,\" said Dr Neave. \"They put any hostility down to people not understanding the laws, or being biased, rather than blaming themselves... \" And each considered he was superior to other referees. \"If they didn't have that confidence they would wilt,\" said Dr Neave. \"Their characteristics may be anti-social but they are necessary... to do their job properly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
