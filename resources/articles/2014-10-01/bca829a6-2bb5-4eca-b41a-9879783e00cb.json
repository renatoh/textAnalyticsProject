Keith Bristow, director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), said it was uncomfortable to accept that some of those in the UK who regularly access indecent images of children will not end up facing justice but admitted that the police were simply unable to pursue all of those engaged in such crimes. He said law-enforcement agencies must instead focus on the highest-risk offenders, who at the top end were criminals who sexually abused children. This meant that lower-risk suspects could fall through the net. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can be more candid than, say, if there are 50,000 people involved in this particularly horrible type of criminality, I don\u2019t believe that all 50,000 will end up in the criminal justice system being brought to justice,\u201d said Bristow. \u201cOur responsibility is to focus on the greatest risk and tackle those people. But the wider responsibility that falls to all of us is to stop people getting involved in this activity, to help young people protect themselves and to work hard to understand the totality of the problem so where we are arresting people and bringing them to justice that\u2019s mitigating as much risk to young people as possible.\u201d His remarks split opinion last night, with the Labour party claiming that it was clear that the NCA \u201cwas not fit\u201d to deal with the scale and seriousness of the problem. \u201cNow it\u2019s clear the NCA have details on tens of thousands of people who have accessed vile images of child abuse,\u201d said Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. \u201cYet only 600 have been arrested and they are not even attempting to investigate the vast majority of cases. Of course they need to look first for the most dangerous cases, but it seems most cases aren\u2019t being investigated at all.\u201d However, Jon Brown, of the children\u2019s charity NSPCC, said Bristow had revealed \u201can uncomfortable truth\u201d about the difficult daily decisions officers face in identifying and pursuing offenders. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the police can only do what they can with the budgets available to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government must make tackling this vile trade a priority in the funding available to the NCA and at a local force level.\u201d It has previously been estimated by the NCA that there were 50,000 people in the UK regularly accessing indecent images of children in 2013. Bristow also told reporters at a briefing: \u201cThe reality is everyone who accesses an indecent image of a child, the idea that every single one of them is going to go into the criminal justice process, is not realistic. \u201cAs abhorrent as even the lower-risk part of this is, and it\u2019s still abhorrent and it\u2019s still horrible, particularly when seen alongside other things like acquisitive crime, we\u2019re going to have to start thinking differently about not just how we pursue these people but how we prevent people perpetrating this particular form of horribleness.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is start at No 1 and work through to 50,000. What we have to do is apply a logic based on law-enforcement experience, and academic support, to work through and try and find the highest risk that sits within that and our contention is the highest risk are those people who go on or have the propensity to commit contact abuse, which is right at the high end.\u201d The Home Office said the government was determined to stamp out child sexual exploitation, adding that the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) had been brought into the NCA to ensure child abuse investigators have access to the agency\u2019s extensive crime-fighting resources and global expertise. According to the Home Office: \u201cAll NCA officers \u2013 approximately 4,500 people \u2013 have a legal duty to safeguard children and promote their welfare, and there are now more posts dedicated to tackling child sexual exploitation and abuse in the NCA than existed in the CEOP centre in 2010. \u201cThe NCA is currently leading an unprecedented operation against online child abusers in the UK. In the last 12 months the NCA has safeguarded or protected more than 1,000 children and 706 arrests have been made by forces in the course of NCA-led and coordinated operational activity against CSE and abuse.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
