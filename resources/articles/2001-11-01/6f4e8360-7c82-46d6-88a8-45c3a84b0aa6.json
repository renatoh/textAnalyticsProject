For the English expeditionary force, therefore, the immediate task is not so much to dig for victory as simply to dig in. This should be the best round that the tournament has yet seen. Seldom have so many of European football's crowned heads and young pretenders found themselves vying for quarter-final places. Seldom, either, have the lines of distinction between the old aristocrats and a thrusting new meritocracy been so blurred. Galatasaray are by no means the only young Turks on the block. Until recently an English team seeing off the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus could rightly consider itself the bee's knees. Only two years ago Manchester United's remarkable comeback to beat Juventus in the semi-finals established Alex Ferguson's team as European champions elect, even if they did not come over quite like that when beating Bayern Munich in the final. Tonight, in Group A, United will meet Bayern for the third time in the Champions League since that night at the Nou Camp, but whatever the result the plot in this group will hardly be set in stone. Both Nantes and Boavista, who held Liverpool to two draws, are capable of confounding form and forecasts. And this is reckoned to be one of the more predictable of the four second-round groups - quite unlike Group B, where tonight Liverpool and Barcelona meet at Anfield knowing that Roma and Galatasaray are capable of denying them further progress. Almost as much goes for Group D in which Arsenal visit Deportivo La Coruna tomorrow evening with Juventus due at Highbury a fortnight today and Bayer Leverkusen lurking. Leverkusen, like Deportivo and Liverpool, lead their national league, having deposed Bayern at the weekend. Among last season's champions Real Madrid, like United and Roma, have so far found their better form only in fits and starts. Yet it would be unwise to judge the Champions League potential of these clubs in terms of domestic performances. While not every manager or coach rotates his team barrel-organ fashion like Ferguson, only when Europe is put under mid-winter wraps does the home front become a priority. Ferguson is still about where he would have chosen to be at this stage: safely into the second phase of the Champions League while two points away from the top at home. Avoiding defeat in Munich tonight would confirm this sanguine state of affairs while a win for United would add weight to their manager's weekend assertion that the empire at Old Trafford was not crumbling. Ferguson is beginning to sound like Richard III when messengers keep bringing him bad news: \"Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd? Is the King dead? The empire unpossess'd?\" Richard met with a sticky end but then he did not have Ryan Giggs. United lost twice, and badly, to Bayern in last season's quarter-finals but since then their away form in the Champions League has improved. Ferguson's decision to push Paul Scholes forward and employ Roy Keane deeper in order to accommodate Juan Sebastian Veron made sense against Olympiakos and would have brought United victory in La Coruna had the defence not suffered one of its bouts of narcolepsy in the closing minutes. A Bayern side fortified by the return of Stefan Effenberg may be relied upon to exploit any ongoing repetition of the individual errors which are apt to leave Ferguson's defence looking about as safe as a sandcastle at high tide. On the other hand the speed of Giggs, David Beckham's crosses and a touch of the old Scholes ought to pose considerable problems for Bayern when combined with the undoubted class of Veron and Ruud van Nistelrooy - enough, anyway, to deny Munich an early win and set United up nicely for the visit of Boavista to Old Trafford a fortnight tomorrow. Certainly Arsenal would settle for something similar in La Coruna tomorrow, although after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's weekend lament about the way his team is squandering Premiership points anything other than a win for Deportivo will be a surprise. Four points from this match and the Juventus game would no doubt satisfy Wenger and presumably Liverpool would not be disappointed to find themselves with a similar total after meeting Barcelona at Anfield tonight followed by Roma in the Stadio Olimpico. For this to happen Phil Thompson's so far successful handling of the team in the absence of the convalescing G\u00e9rard Houllier now needs to embrace a win against a Barcelona side keen to avenge a defeat in last season's Uefa Cup semi-finals. While Liverpool's hopes lie largely with Michael Owen, their defence needs to reassert the stranglehold it imposed on Barca in April. \u00b7 TV: Liverpool v Barcelona, ITV 1, 7pm; Bayern V Man Utd, ITV Sport, 7pm; Highlights, ITV 1, 11.30pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
