I'd seen how developed the black cosmetics market was in the US. Here it was a different story - a lack of choice, a lack of understanding of black and Asian skin issues, such as oiliness and pigmentation, and a lack of service. Having taught myself a bit about make-up, I rented a chair in a local hairdressers and gave makeovers. This was my market research. With a $1,000 loan from my aunt in the US, I got together some cosmetic formulations, and by 2002 I opened a shop in Deptford. My big idea was custom-blending foundation, because getting the right shade at an affordable price is a real challenge for black and Asian women. Then I got a chance to set up a concession in Morley's department store in Brixton, and I haven't looked back. I love seeing my clients grow in confidence after we've spent time with them. They cry, they hug me and they phone at midnight to tell me how great their skin is looking. It doesn't get better than that. yanacosmetics.com (020-7095 9513 at Morley's; 07939 890810 for inquiries). Catherine Everest - Owner of CE London, a luxury aromatherapy bath and body range I met Anna Hill, who had studied with Aromatherapy Associates [a leading aromatherapy product and training company], at the nursery gates and we became friends. She also had two children and, like mine, they had sensitive skin and were eczema-prone - of course, all the GP could prescribe were the usual hydrocortisone creams and emollient bath and body creams. As we were trying to eat organically, it made no sense to load the children's skin with chemicals. It was Anna who suggested we play around with our own formulations. She mixed up a blend with a pure jojoba oil base and high-quality organic essential oils of lavender and Roman camomile. Not only did it soothe and help clear their eczema, but the children were sleeping better, partly because they weren't scratching themselves and partly because Roman camomile is a sedative. Soon we started supplying other mums at the school gates. I suggested to Anna that, rather than giving away our oils, we should create a business. I thought a really luxurious, beautifully packaged organic aromatherapy range could work well. Soon, financed by our savings, we were packing up small quantities of our products at the kitchen table. By September 1999, via a contact I'd met through my husband, we were stocked in Barneys department store in New York. A couple of years ago, I had a call from Number 10. Cherie Blair had been given some of my products and asked if I could make a blend for her to use at Downing Street and as gifts. So I created an exclusive blend, No 10, with their corporate colours of green and gold. It's come a long way from two mothers' search for a natural eczema remedy for their children. catherineeverest.com (for stockist and mail-order details, call 020-8540 4454). Will King - Founder and CEO of King Of Shaves shaving and skincare range I'd always hated shaving, and used to end up with blood on my shirts and skin rashes. My epiphany was using some of my then girlfriend (now wife) Ann's bath oil under my usual shaving foam. There was no burn. Then I tried shaving just with the oil. It was easy and left my skin feeling comfortable. I thought, if it works for me, it'll work for other men. Ann and I bought some books and tried making a blend with essential oils in a sweet almond oil base, but I ended up going to an essential oil supplier for a proper formulation, which cost \u00a3250. Ann designed the packaging and printed it out at work. It was real back-bedroom stuff. In 1993, the first year's sales were \u00a3300. Losses were \u00a330,000. Then, in 1994, we got an order from Boots, so we bought 10,000 bottles and spent two weeks filling them over the kitchen sink to make the delivery date. The concept of a shaving oil was new, it looked different from anything else on the market. Today, the range has expanded to include low-lather shaving gels and hi-tech skincare, because I needed them, too. Our sales have reached \u00a312m. shave.com Laith Waines - Co-founder and joint MD of the Refinery, a men-only spa In 1997, I was dating a girl who loved going to health spas. We went to Henlow Grange in Bedfordshire for a weekend and, while I loved the treatments, I found wandering around in a bathrobe as one of very few male guests daunting and scary. I found myself thinking I wanted the spa experience, but in a male environment. Together with Omar Fadli, a work colleague - we were investment bankers - I did a feasibility study into the concept of a male spa and found that nothing like it existed in the UK. Once we knew it could work, we got finance from our contacts in banking and quit our jobs. It took 13 months to get up and running. The biggest challenge was convincing a landlord about a spa for men, but eventually we found a five-storey Georgian townhouse opposite Claridges hotel in London. In mid-2002, we opened a branch in the City. In Brook Street, a real cross-section of men walked in, from builders to footballers; the City clients were more reserved - they'd email for appointments, rather than phone. But men's grooming is becoming increasingly acceptable, so our timing was perfect. The only downside is I'm so busy, I don't have time for treatments. the-refinery.com (020-7409 2001). Merri Mayers - Founder of Comfort &amp; Joy, natural skin- and bodycare products All my life I'd had rotten skin. When you're in your 30s and have spots as well as the first signs of wrinkles, that adds insult to injury. In the early 1990s, I was on doctor-ordered rest after a bout of pneumonia, and I turned my attention to my skin. I had studied biochemistry in my native US, and combined that knowledge with book-taught aromatherapy and herbalism to create a formulation for my skin. I was keen to avoid chemicals, and bought raw materials for a moisturising oil (it's now called Facial Soother and is our bestseller). I can remember applying it with trepidation, but my skin looked and felt great, and continued to improve over the next few weeks. Then I turned my attention to hand cream, cleansers and shampoos. From there, I supplied friends. When it got to supplying friends of friends, the management consultant in me took over and I set up Comfort &amp; Joy as a business. It was thrilling when I had a call from an A-list celebrity's office in Hollywood requesting some products. I thought it was a joke at first, but she's a loyal customer now. comfortandjoy.co.uk (01367 850278)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
