He challenged the United States to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, and declared that dropping out of high school was \"no longer an option\". Those priorities were reflected in the $3.6tn budget his administration released two days later, and the $115bn for schools included in the recently passed stimulus package. While some question whether education, traditionally a state and local issue, merits the attention it has just been given on the national agenda, Obama is right to bring education to the fore. There isn't a single economic woe that could not be softened in part by improving our schools. Educational attainment, like energy independence, is something America has been falling behind on for some time, and it won't be fixed simply by sending more students to college. Because of rotten preparation in elementary and secondary schools, nearly a third of college freshmen have to repeat college classes and half of US college students don't even finish. Seventy percent of US eighth graders can't read on grade level, and over 6,000 high school students drop out every day. It's painfully clear that our schools need to do better, but there isn't much consensus on how to build high-performing systems, even assuming the funding and political will to do so. What does this have to do with the economy? Simple bread and butter arithmetic \u2013 an increase in educational attainment, in the long term, will grow America's GDP while saving taxpayers money. Studies show that a high school dropout earns about $260,000 less over a lifetime than a high school graduate and pays about $60,000 less in taxes. This earning differential means that America misses out on $192bn (1.6% of its GDP) with each cohort of 18-year-olds who fail to earn a high school diploma, let alone a college degree. There are social ramifications as well. People with higher levels of education are less likely to commit violent crime, be on Medicaid or welfare, or be admitted to prison. Researchers project that if one third of all Americans without a high school diploma were to get more education, the savings to taxpayers would be huge: ranging from $3.8bn to $6.7bn for family assistance, $3.7bn for food stamps and $400m for housing assistance. Obama is also right to be concerned about America's position in the global marketplace. Other developed nations are swelling their ranks of college-educated workers, but if current trends persist, we'll rank 18th in ten years in the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor's degree. (As recently as 1998, the US ranked first.) And higher education is becoming increasingly essential for American workers to remain competitive. The Bureau of Labor statistics has reported that within five years, over half of all new jobs will require at least some college \u2013 which means we may be facing shortages of skilled workers before today's first graders even finish high school. But while investing in education is good economics, it's not an immediate solution to the financial crisis at hand. The priorities Obama laid out in his budget are costly, and will take time to be accepted by the education establishment. Already there is bickering within the policy world over his attention (or lack thereof) to specific programmes and initiatives, such as charter schools, financial aid and merit pay. And even reforms implemented tomorrow will take many years to yield results. As jobs are lost and banks fail, a Congress eager for quick relief may not have the patience to wait around for the long-term impact Obama is forecasting. Let's hope that politics and short-term gimmicks won't derail what America really needs to secure its economic well-being \u2013 a public education system that works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
