In Sevastopol, Russian forces blocked a Ukrainian naval vessel. \u2022 A UN envoy to Crimea was ejected by a pro-Russian crowd from Simferopol. The reportedly hostile crowd surrounded the envoy\u2019s car and temporarily cornered him in a cafe. International monitors in Crimea were the target of protests. \u2022 Europe announced a $15bn aid package for Ukraine, atop a $1bn aid package announced by the US administration and supported by Congress. \u2022 Doubts about the resolve of Europe to put together a sanctions package against Russia were dismissed by diplomats. European Union leaders were to meet Thursday to make a decision on sanctions. More on sanctions here. \u2022 The United States failed to bring the Ukrainian and Russian foreign minister face-to-face through a day of meetings in Paris, but US secretary of state John Kerry said \u201cconcrete\u201d progress had been made and all sides had agreed to pursue a diplomatic solution. \u2022 Nato announced a full review of all cooperation with Russia, suspended planning for a Nato-Russian joint operation to escort Syria chemical weapons and suspended staff-level civilian or military meetings with Russia. \u2022 The Pentagon said the US military was doubling its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics. And Dostoyevsky makes an appearance. The US state department is circulating 10 recent claims of Russian president Vladimir Putin \u201cjustifying Russian aggression in the Ukraine, followed by the facts that his assertions ignore or distort.\u201d The list is introduced with a Dostoyevsky allusion that we have to say is kind of a stretch: As Russia spins a false narrative to justify its illegal actions in Ukraine, the world has not seen such startling Russian fiction since Dostoyevsky wrote, \u201cThe formula \u2018two plus two equals five\u2019 is not without its attractions.\u201d 1. Mr. Putin says: Russian forces in Crimea are only acting to protect Russian military assets. It is \u201ccitizens\u2019 defense groups,\u201d not Russian forces, who have seized infrastructure and military facilities in Crimea. The Facts: Strong evidence suggests that members of Russian security services are at the heart of the highly organized anti-Ukraine forces in Crimea. While these units wear uniforms without insignia, they drive vehicles with Russian military license plates and freely identify themselves as Russian security forces when asked by the international media and the Ukrainian military. Moreover, these individuals are armed with weapons not generally available to civilians. Read the whole list here. The German foreign minister: \u201cnot satisfied\u201d: Guardian Europe editor Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) and Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) have written up the day in inconclusive diplomacy: Negotiations in Paris between John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, broke up without agreement on Wednesday. The Americans and the Europeans hoped to persuade Moscow to open a dialogue with the new government in Kiev and also to withdraw its forces in Crimea to their bases and allow in international monitors. But while Lavrov accused the Americans of tabling unacceptable ultimatums, Kerry said there were \u201ca number of ideas \u201d up for discussion. Both men are expected to resume negotiations in Rome on Thursday after consulting their respective presidents, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. \u201cThings have moved in a good direction,\u201d said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister. Read the full piece here. Robert Serry, the UN envoy threatened earlier today by a pro-Russia crowd in Crimea, is in Istanbul temporarily but plans to head soon for Kiev, the UN said. Reuters has a newly detailed description of what happened (with, notably, a question as to whether there were weapons involved; Serry\u2019s assistant had said she saw at least one man with a gun in the group): His interpreter, Vadim Kastelli, said Serry was escorted to the airport without being given a chance to pick up his bags from his hotel and placed on the first flight out. Kastelli, who was with Serry at the time, said the incident began when Serry was blocked by a group of men in civilian clothes after a meeting at a Ukrainian military compound. Kastelli said he saw no weapons, although a journalist for Britain\u2019s ITN television said Serry told him at least one of the men was armed. According to U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, who spoke to reporters in New York by telephone from Kiev, Serry had been visiting the naval headquarters in the regional capital, Simferopol. \u201cOn his way out, he was threatened and brought to his car. There were unidentified people, some of them armed, telling him to leave and go to the airport,\u201d Eliasson said. \u201cHe refused but his car couldn\u2019t move, and he decided he would depart (on foot).\u201d Eliasson said Serry felt \u201cseriously threatened,\u201d though he dismissed as false earlier reports that Serry had been kidnapped. Kastelli said the men insisted they should take Serry straight to the airport and out of the country, but Serry refused and eventually left his surrounded vehicle on foot. Kastelli said he became separated from Serry when the envoy left the scene. The ITV journalist, James Mates, said Serry, currently the U.N. Middle East envoy and previously Dutch ambassador to Ukraine, later took shelter in a cafe and agreed to leave Crimea to end the standoff. Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko says \u201cit is up to them\u201d [the US and UK] \u201cto choose the methods to stop the aggressor. But they must do it immediately,\u201d the Associated Press reports. Tymoshenko was speaking at her Kiev office. The West must do \u201ceverything that will stop the aggressor. Period,\u201d Tymoshenko said, arguing that as the signatories of a 1994 treaty, which guarantees Ukraine\u2019s security in exchange for it giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Britain must now deal directly with Russia. A packed diary for the US secretary of state. British prime minister David Cameron spoke with US president Barack Obama earlier today as the latter flew from Washington to Connecticut, Reuters reports. No details were immediately available. Kerry and Deshchytsia are on the same side, but their national soccer / football teams, which have just faced off in Cyprus, aren\u2019t. The Guardian\u2019s lively live blog coverage of that match is here. Here\u2019s a summary of Kerry\u2019s news conference: \u2022 Kerry said \u201cAll parties agreed today that it is important to try to decide these issues through dialogue\u201d... \u201ctoday we initiated that process that over the next couple of days, we hope, can bring us to that path of de-escalation.\u201d \u2022 Asked why the Ukrainian and Russian ministers had not met, Kerry said that that was never the intention, but that he had flown Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia to Paris on his plane because \u201cThis is a Ukrainian decision, and we respect that.\u201d \u2022 Kerry denied an EU sanctions package was failing to coalesce. \u201cThere\u2019s been no movement away from the possibility,\u201d he said. \u2022 Kerry said \u201cconcrete\u201d progress had been made: \u201cI personally feel that I have something concrete that I can take back and talk to president Obama about ... and I believe that foreign minister Lavrov is in exactly the same position with president Putin.\u201d \u2022 Kerry called on Russia to enter direct dialogue with Ukraine, to withdraw troops in Crimea to bases and to accept international monitors in Ukraine. \u201cRussia\u2019s violation has actually united the world in support of the Ukrainian people,\u201d he said. \u201cI was encouraged today that Russia indicated that they would prefer to see us to be able to find that path\u201d to a diplomatic solution, Kerry said. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of a negotiation.\u201d He\u2019s done. Kerry denies a European sanctions package is failing to coalesce: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been weakened at all by what you call European reluctance,\u201d Kerry says. He cites his conversations with EU leaders and foreign ministers today. \u201cPeople are very serious about that. There\u2019s been no movement away from the possibility.\u201d \u201cI think today was very constructive. Without promising something that is not defined yet... I want to be realistic. This is hard, tough, stufff, and a very serious moment. I\u2019d rather be where we are today than where we are [sic] yesterday.\u201d Kerry speaks in French with a reporter, who asks whether Russia has moved favorably toward the Western position and then asks about progress on sanctions. \u201cThe decisions for the Europeans are the decision for the Europeans, and they\u2019re meeting tomorrow,\u201d on sanctions, Kerry says. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that we did not have serious conversations which produced creative and appropriate ideas and possibilities for how we can resolve that. \u201cI personally feel that I have something concrete that I can take back and talk to president Obama about, ... and I believe that foreign minister Lavrov is in exactly the same position with president Putin. Kerry is asked why Lavrov did not meet with Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia. \u201cI had no expectation, zero expectation, that today that kind of meeting would take place... We did not ask the foreign minister to come here with that purpose,\u201d Kerry says. \u201cWe brought him here because we knew it would have been inappropriate for us\u201d to talk with Lavrov without consulting with Deschchytsia, Kerry says. \u201cThis is a Ukrainian decision, and we respect that.\u201d Kerry says he\u2019ll be in touch with the Ukrainians later tonight. And tomorrow Kerry is to meet Lavrov again. Kerry says \u201ctoday we initiated that process that over the next couple of days, we hope, can bring us to that path of de-escalation.\u201d Kerry turns to Ukraine. He says Ukrainians \u201cdesperately\u201d want a government of consent of the people. \u201cWe agree to continue intense discussions in the coming days with Russia, with the Ukrainians, in order to see how we can help normalize the situation, stabilize it...\u201d he says, and continues: All parties agreed today that it is important to try to decide these issues through dialogue. The United States... is focusing intensely on a remedy. We cannot and will not allow the integrity and sovereignty of the country of Ukraine to be violated... Russia\u2019s violation has actually united the world in support of the Ukrainian people. Russia made a choice. And we have clearly stated that we believe it is the wrong choice, to move troops into Crimea. Russia can now make the right choice... To find the road to de-escalation, the United States is ready to work with all parties.\u201d Kerry asks Russia to talk directly with Ukraine, to withdraw troops to barracks in Crimea and to respect and welcome international monitors: We see today with what happened to ambassador Serry, just how important it is to ensure the safety of those monitors and of those observers. Kerry begins speaking. He is making a statement on Lebanon\u2019s crisis in hosting refugees from Syria, whom he says number \u201calmost a million\u201d but who by some counts, including relatives in Syria forced to stay with family members in Lebanon, are more numerous. While we wait on Kerry, we\u2019d invite you to review our just-published explanatory resource, \u201cUkraine\u2019s revolution and Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea: how we got here\u201d, by Alan Yuhas (@AlanYuhas) and Raya Jalabi (@RayaJalabi): The latest developments are the result of a four-month-long deadlock between Ukrainian demonstrators and Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s government. Protests erupted on 21 November 2013 when then-president Yanukovich backtracked on promises made to sign a trade deal with the EU, allegedly at Moscow\u2019s behest. Though protests, set off by the pivot toward Russia, were initially peaceful, things turned violent in January when police tried to break up demonstrations in a violent crackdown. Dozens died before a European-brokered peace deal ended the fighting, but as violence began again, Yanukovych disappeared. He has since surfaced in Russia, claiming to be the legitimate ruler of his country. \u2022 How did Ukraine get here (and why do some people say \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d)? \u2022 Let\u2019s break this out with some maps \u2022 Political divisions: Yanukovych v Tymoshenko and EU v Russia \u2022 Why Russia is in Crimea \u2022 Talks continued in Paris among American, European and Ukrainian envoys on the crisis in Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister left talks without meeting his Ukrainian counterpart. \u201cWe agreed to continue those discussions in the days to come,\u201d he said. \u2022 Two incidents of hostility against international monitors in Crimea were reported. In one, a UN envoy was trapped temporarily inside a coffee shop by armed men. In another, a testy crowd waited at a hotel for international delegates. \u2022 Multiple confrontations between pro-Russia and pro-Kiev groups were reported, in Donetsk, Simferopol and Sevastopol. In Sevastopol, Russian forces blocked a Ukrainian naval vessel. \u2022 Nato announced a full review of all cooperation with Russia, suspended planning for a Nato-Russian joint operation to escort Syria chemical weapons and suspended staff-level civilian or military meetings with Russia. \u2022 The Pentagon said the US military was doubling its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics. \u2022 The difficult realities behind threats of sanctions and counter-sanctions began to move to the foreground in advance of a European Union meeting Thursday. \u2022 US secretary of state John Kerry just ambled past reporters in Paris eagerly awaiting his version of today\u2019s talks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a statement in a little while,\u201d he said. The Pentagon has announced plans to more than double its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics, Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) reports: The US currently provides four F-15s to fill NATO\u2019s Baltic Air Policing rotation. \u201cThis week, the United States will send six additional F-15s and one KC-135 to augment the mission,\u201d the official said. \u201cThese aircraft \u2013 currently based at Lakenheath in the United Kingdom \u2013 will be deployed to Siauliai Air Base in Lithuania.\u201d The Pentagon is also increasing its commitment o joint airforce-training exercises in Poland. \u201cThis is a time for wise, steady, and firm leadership,\u201d defense secretary Chuck Hagel told a Senate panel. \u201cAnd it is a time for all of us to stand with the Ukrainian people in support of their territorial integrity and their sovereignty. And we are doing that.\u201d An unnamed senior US state department official denied the Russian characterization of today\u2019s Lavrov-Kerry talks: \u201cThere were no agreements in this meeting, and there never will be without direct Ukrainian government involvement and absolute buy-in,\u201d the official said. Contrast that with the Russian foreign ministry take: German chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken again by phone with Russian president Vladimir Putin to \u201cdiscuss possible international efforts to help improve the situation in Ukraine,\u201d Reuters reports. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has departed talks in Paris without meeting Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia, Reuters quotes Western diplomats as saying. \u201cWe are all concerned at what it is happening there,\u201d Lavrov told reporters on leaving the French Foreign Ministry. \u201cWe agreed to continue those discussions in the days to come to see how best we can help stabilize, normalize the situation and overcome the crisis,\u201d he added. Separately, a US state department official denied Lavrov\u2019s earlier claim that Russia and the United States had agreed to abide by the 21 February agreement. Time magazine reports a really warm reception for international observers arriving in Crimea. Earlier today the UN envoy to Crimea was intercepted by 10-15 armed men outside a Simferopol base and pursued to a coffee shop, where he was trapped for a time before leaving in a car as a hostile crowd shouted \u201cPutin! Putin!\u201d Kim Willsher is trailing Kerry in Paris: European sanctions on Ukrainians are developing more quickly than sanctions on Russians. Britain has announced it is freezing the assets of 18 Ukrainians suspected of misappropriating Ukrainian state funds, Reuters reports, pointing to a tweet by the finance minister: Reuters has this context: Last week Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein said they were taking similar steps against 18 Ukrainians. It was not immediately clear whether the same 18 people would be affected by Britain\u2019s move. Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen announces the Atlantic council has decided to place its cooperation activities with Russia under review. The announcement followed a meeting of the Nato-Russia council in Brussels. Rasmussen said he asked the Russian ambassador to advise Moscow on the conclusion. Update: the full Nato statement is here. Rasmussen tweeted the details of the Nato decision: We suspended planning for 1st #NATO-#Russia joint op: maritime escort for US ship Cape Ray which neutralizes #Syria #CW No staff-level civilian or military meetings w/ #Russia for now \u2013 decisions to be taken by #NATO #ForMin in April We want to keep door open for dialogue &amp; maintain ambassadors meetings in #NATO-#Russia Council The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers, plus their American and British counterparts, have arrived at the French foreign ministry, Reuters reports. Update: At no point did Lavrov meet with Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia, Reuters reports. The apparent new meeting follows bilateral talks between US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. \u201cSpeaking to media after talks, Lavrov said the two sides agreed to join efforts to help Ukraine to reach the agreement signed in Kiev on Feb. 21,\u201d Lavrov reports. Update: The US state department denies any such agreement. Protesters in Independence Square in Kiev never accepted the deal, and president Viktor Yanukovich fled the capital the day he signed it. The text of the 21 February deal is here. It arranged for a unity government, early presidential elections, a ban on declarations of martial law, constitutional reform and investigations into violence. Russian president Vladimir Putin has threatened to respond in kind to any Western sanctions, but analysts say that doing so could be ineffective or harm Russia\u2019s own economy, reports Alec Luhn (@ASLuhn) for the Guardian: Russian officials have threatened to write off debts to American banks and even seize the assets of Western companies. But analysts doubted the effectiveness of such measures... \u201cThe only way out is to work on diplomacy to prevent sanctions, because in terms of sanctions Russia has a weaker position,\u201d said Investcafe analyst Andrei Shenk. [...] Shenk lampooned asset seizures and debt write-offs as \u201cthe action of a third-world country\u201d and said they would ultimately hurt the Russian economy. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the nationalisation of property, and nationalisation will scare away all investors,\u201d Shenk said. \u201cIt can lead to the Russian economy losing the ability to get money from abroad, including credit resources, which the Russian economy has a dependence on right now\u201d. Putin may not have to worry about it. On the other end, Europe and the United States face steep challenges in cobbling together an effective sanctions package, reports Guardian Europe editor Ian Traynor (@TraynorBrussels): A crisis that started with an EU summit fiasco three months ago may climax on Thursday with an EU summit failure as Putin\u2019s short-term hard power collides with European longer-term soft power and leaves the EU looking weak and feckless. The Italians and the French do not want to punish Putin. The Swedes and the east Europeans take a hard line. The British government is worried about the impact on the City of London and losing big-spending oligarchs in west London. German industry is lobbying strongly against imposing sanctions on Russia. And while Washington talks of isolating Russia because of Ukraine, Berlin is saying the opposite, stressing engagement and keeping channels open to the Kremlin. Read the full piece here. Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) reports that House speaker John Boehner compared the sanctions package that Congress was working on against Russia to the seemingly much broader measures deployed against Iran: \u201cWe gave the administration what I\u2019ll call a tool-box of sanctions [against Tehran] that they had the ability to impose as they saw fit,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe majority leader, and the committee chairs, are working with the administration on that possibility.\u201d We\u2019re waiting to hear from Kerry in Paris. Still no sign of him, Kim Willsher reports. Harriet Salem (@HarrietSalem) has been reporting from Donetsk on a struggle for control of a government administration building. There\u2019s another crowded confrontation playing out in Donetsk, Harriet writes, in Lenin Square, a 5-10 minute walk away.\u201d Around 3,000 people gathered in Lenin Square at 18:00 to rally for Ukrainian unity,\u201d she writes: The crowd chanted, \u201cGlory to Ukraine, Glory to its heroes\u201d and \u201cUkraine is united\u201d. The unity protesters were separated from around 1,000 pro-Russia supporters by a line of riot police. The pro-Russia group hurled eggs at the other side and chanted \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia,\u201d and \u201cBerkut\u201d. A giant Ukrainian flag was carried by the crowd by the unity protesters. Ukrainian hymns were played over the loudspeaker as people prayed for peace. Harriet spoke with a police academy student named Aleksandar, who told her, \u201cI am here to support and stand for united Ukraine. We want to be united, and no one to enter our territory\u201d. Valentin Brylev, 65, a Ukrainian Cossack, said that Donetsk is not divided. \u201cThese people [the pro-Russia supporters] represent a \u201csmall minority of idiots\u201d he said. Kim Willsher is reporting for the Guardian on the ongoing Kerry-Lavrov meeting in Paris. The Russian foreign ministry Twitter feed gets literary: That\u2019s a well-hydrated meeting. Mates reports that Serry has escaped, after the path of his \u201ccar was [temporarily] blocked by protesters chanting Putin Putin.\u201d Mates concludes: \u201cVery unpleasant incident over. Robert Serry said v happy to leave #crimea if it helped de escalate the situation.\u201d The UN special envoy to Ukraine, Robert Serry, was blockaded inside a coffee shop in Crimea by a militia, according to ITV Europe editor James Mates, who is in the shop with Serry. Mates is narrating the standoff. \u201cWith Robert Serry now,\u201d he writes: not kidnapped, but held in a coffee shop. Some men outside prevent him from leaving. Special rep is waiting in coffee shop for help. He\u2019s asked us to stay with him and keep filming #Ukriane UN special advisor Robert Serry had been visiting navy commander when his car was blocked. Stand off followed #Ukraine UN special envoy Robert Serry\u2019s assistant says she saw at least one man with a gun among group who blocked his car. #Ukraine Outside coffee shop are men in combat fatigues blocking the door. Some wear pro Russia black and gold arm band. Not allowing anyone in/out Inexplicably, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson on Wednesday denied reports that U.N. representative in Ukraine Robert Serry was seized by armed men in Crimea. Eliasson treated the situation as resolved, Reuters reports: \u201cHe was not kidnapped but he was seriously threatened,\u201d Eliasson told reporters in New York by telephone from Kiev, adding that \u201cthis action should be seriously condemned.\u201d \u2022 Russian boats blocked a Ukrainian navy ship with about 50 officers aboard at a Sevastapol port and Russian soldiers patrolled the dock. \u2022 Pro-Russian demonstrators took a government building in the southeastern city of Donetsk back from Ukrainian police in an ongoing tug-of-war. The demonstrators hoisted a Russian flag. In Simferopol, a group of pro-Russian demonstrators tried to block a military base and clashed with pro-Kiev demonstrators. \u2022 Russia declined to withdraw its forces in Crimea to their bases. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov denied the presence of Russians apart from the Black Sea fleet, who he said \u201care in their deployment sites\u201d and are taking \u201cadditional vigilance measures.\u201d \u2022 US defense secretary Chuck Hagel said the US military is stepping up joint training through an aviation detachment in Poland and is boosting participation in a Nato air policing mission. \u2022 The Nato-Russian council was to meet Wednesday in Brussels. In Paris, European foreign ministers met with Russian and US envoys to discuss Ukraine. \u2022 US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Lavrov met one-on-one, briefly, to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. Kerry urged Russia to meet directly with Ukraine, the state department said. \u2022 But Russia skipped a meeting the US and UK attempted to convene with Ukraine to talk about the 1994 Budapest memorandum arranging for Ukraine\u2019s security in exchange for nuclear non-proliferation guarantees. \u2022 The European Commission approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to at least \u20ac11bn in coming years. A US package for $1bn gained support in principle from congressional Republicans. \u2022 Russian President Putin said he did not want political tension to detract from economic cooperation with Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional partners.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing known political tension, it should not affect our current economic cooperation,\u201d he was quoted as saying. The Ukrainian currency took a slide, meanwhile, and the prime minister warned of worse. \u2022 International observers from 18 countries were scheduled to begin arriving in Crimea. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia could not invite them there because only a host can invite and Ukraine is an independent country. Ukrainian prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk warned that the Russian presence in Ukraine \u201cis having an extremely negative effect on Ukraine\u2019s economy,\u201d Reuters reports: ...the hryvnia currency has been under heavy pressure, hitting a record low of 11.6510 to the U.S. dollar on Monday. But the hryvnia has risen back to 9.40 per dollar because investors increasingly believe Ukraine will secure new loans quickly enough to avoid a default. Kiev must repay a $1 billion eurobond in early June and the government has also guaranteed a $1.6 billion Eurobond issued by state energy company Naftogaz, which falls due in September. Both Ukraine and Russia said Tuesday that Kiev owes Moscow $2bn in gas payments. Republicans in Congress have pledged to work with president Barack Obama to approve a $1bn loan guarantee package for Ukraine. Both House speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor expressed support for the aid in statements Wednesday morning. Cantor did add that the aid package should ultimately be offset by other savings, Reuters notes. So there still seems to be plenty of room for them to disagree. On the basis of a leaked conversation between the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonia\u2019s Foreign Minister Urmas Paet, state-funded Russia Today is reporting that: \u201cThe snipers who shot at protesters and police in Kiev were allegedly hired by Maidan leaders.\u201d In, the leaked call, Paet repeats some allegations made to him by a woman called Olga and bemoans the fact that they are not being investigated. The Estonian foreign ministry says he was not making any allegations himself about who was responsible for the shots that were fired during the protests against Viktor Yanukovych. In the conversation, the authenticity of which has been confirmed by the foreign ministry, and which took place on 26 February after Paet had returned from a visit to Ukraine, he says: What was quite disturbing, the same Olga told [me] as well, all the evidence shows that people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among policeman and people from the streets [is] they were the same snipers killing people from both sides \u2026she also showed me some photos, she said as medical doctor she can say it\u2019s the same handwriting, they\u2019re the same type of bullets and it\u2019s really disturbing that now, the new coalition, they don\u2019t want to investigate exactly what happened so that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych but it was somebody from the new coalition. Ashton replies: I think they do want to investigate. I mean I didn\u2019t pick that up, that\u2019s interesting. Gosh. The Estonian foreign ministry said in a statement: Foreign minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard the previous day in Kiev and expressed concern over the situation on the ground. We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition\u2019s involvement in the violence. A spokeswoman for Ashton\u2019s office said: We can\u2019t comment on leaks but our position on violence is very clear - that it should be investigated. Here is the recording of the phone call. The discussion re the snipers starts 8mins 20 seconds in. US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov \u2013 who have sat across the table many times before, but not since Russian forces spread across Crimea \u2013 have just held a brief one-on-one meeting in Paris to discuss the Ukraine crisis, the state department says. Reuters: \u201cThe Secretary urged direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,\u201d a senior State Department official said of the brief \u201cpull aside\u201d on the sidelines of a conference on Lebanon. The meeting followed a meeting in Paris of foreign ministers from the US, UK, France, Germany and Russia. Lavrov and Kerry were scheduled to meet again this afternoon. Harriet Salem (@HarrietSalem) is in Donetsk reporting for the Guardian on the tug-of-war between Ukrainian police and pro-Russian demonstrators for control of a government administration building. The demonstrators retook control this afternoon. US defense secretary Chuck Hagel is scheduled to speak with his Ukrainian counterpart today, he told Congress in testimony on the Pentagon budget. The U.S. military is stepping up joint training through an aviation detachment in Poland and is boosting participation in a NATO air policing mission, Hagel said, in testimony quoted by Reuters. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, testified alongside Hagel. \u201cThe world will continue to surprise us, often in unpleasant ways,\u201d Dempsey said. Hagel has presented a Pentagon budget of about $500bn for 2015, down about 17% from the 2012 budget of $600bn. Shaun Walker called me from Sevastopol, where he is beside the Slavutych, one of the Ukrainian naval ships that is being blocked from leaving the port. He told me: I can see about 50 Ukrainian naval officers on the boat and there are these Russians who are patrolling the dock around us. One of them just came up to us and asked us if we had the right to be here, if we had a piece of paper to prove that. We asked him if had had a piece of paper to give him the right to be here and he\u2019s gone off to get his superior ... I heard one of the guys talking to the locals and he was saying that they are here because if things kick off here then Russia will get a whole load of refugees supposedly from Ukraine....this guy said \u2018you will be coming to us\u2019. When I started talking to him he suddenly stopped talking about \u2018us\u2019 as Russia. Paul Lewis, our Washington correspondent, writes: The US has formally denounced Russia for failing to attend the meeting over the Budapest Agreement in Paris earlier today. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, hosted the meeting with his UK and Ukrainian counterparts, William Hague and Andriy Deshchytsia. In brief remarks earlier, Kerry said the meeting was \u201cregrettably missing one member\u201d - Russia - which was the other signatory to the so-called 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear weapons in return for security assurances from the world powers. The state department said: The United States had conveyed an invitation to the Russian Federation to the meeting \u2026 We deeply regret that the Russian Federation declined to attend.\u201d Adding: Ukraine voluntarily surrendered the world\u2019s third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in exchange for these assurances. The three governments treat these assurances with utmost seriousness, and expect Russia to as well. Kerry is scheduled to meet with the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov today. Harriet Salem, reporting from the Guardian, just told me that pro-Russia protesters have reoccupied the regional government building in Donetsk that was taken back by police earlier today (the pro-Russia protesters having originally occupied it on Monday. She said: About 200 supporters were addressed by a women on stage. They surged forward and stormed the building, chanting \u201cBerkut, Berkut [the disbanded riot police]\u201d and \u201cRussia, Russia\u201d. They emerged on the first storey of the building. Russian songs from the Soviet era were played over loudspeakers. There was lots of fist-pumping and cheering. They also announced over the loudspeaker that Russia 24 was reporting that Vladimir Putin has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize for his work to protect Ukrainians and there were cheers in response. Putin is reportedly on the list for the Nobel peace prize but it is believed to be for his role in the deal to rid Syria of chemical weapons. A meeting of the US, Russian, British, French and German foreign ministers to discuss the Ukraine crisis, being held by French President Francois Hollande is underway, a presidential source has told reporters at the Elysee presidential palace. Earlier, foreign ministers for the United States, Ukraine and Britain agreed that direct talks between Kiev and Moscow were crucial to resolving tensions and also called for the immediate deployment of international monitors. They said in a joint statement: The United States, United Kingdom and Ukraine agreed that direct talks between Ukraine and Russia, facilitated as needed by members of the international community, are crucial to resolving the current situation They also agreed that international observers should be deployed immediately in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. In an interview with AP, Ukraine\u2019s new prime minister said that he is afraid that Russia might send troops to occupy Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine outside Crimea. Asked the question, Arseniy Yatsenyuk said: Let me put it bluntly: yes, it\u2019s still a concern and Russia is to realise its responsibility and Russia is to stick to its international obligation, to stop the invasion. Mr President (Putin), stop this mess ... A number of military forces of the Russian Federation are deployed in Crimea. We cannot figure out the reason why Russian boots are on Ukrainian ground. And it\u2019s crystal clear that it was ordered personally by President Putin. This is Ukrainian territory and Russia wants to grab control over Crimea. But I will underline again, we will do our best in order to regain control over Ukrainian territory. The Russian military is to be back in the barracks. What happened in Crimea is unconstitutional and resembles ... a coup supported by the Russian government and the Russian military. The Ukrainian government is legitimate. And let me remind Mr. Putin that this government was supported by the constitutional majority of Ukrainian MPs with 371 votes. We are legitimate and we must fulfill our responsibilities. And we strongly recommend to our Russian partners to build up relations with the new Ukrainian government. Ukraine\u2019s acting foreign minister just tweeted this: The EU Council has frozen the assets of 18 people who \u201cmisappropriated Ukrainian state funds\u201d. The press release says: Today\u2019s decision targets 18 persons identified as responsible for such misappropriation whose assets within the European Union will be frozen. The sanctions also contain provisions facilitating the recovery of the frozen funds, once certain conditions are met. The legal acts, including the list of persons subject to sanctions, will be published in tomorrow\u2019s EU Official Journal. The measures will initially apply for twelve months, starting tomorrow. There have been further developments at the port in Sevastopol, Crimea. \u2022 The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is due to hold talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov today in Paris. Separately, Russia is due to hold talks with Nato in Brussels.\u2022 Russia failed to show-up for a meeting with the so-called Budapest agreement group, which involves Washington, London, Moscow and Kiev. But the UK foreign secretary, William Hague said he was continuing attempts to get the Ukrainians and Russians together. \u2022 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that 35 unarmed military personnel are on their way to Ukraine to act as observers in response to a request from Kiev. They include observers from the US and UK. \u2022 The European Commission has approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to at least \u20ac11bn in coming years. The package also includes technical assistance on a number of areas from constitutional to judicial reform and preparation of elections. \u2022 Ukrainian police ejected pro-Moscow demonstrators from a regional government building and raised its flag where Russia\u2019s had flown since the weekend, signalling an important shift of control in the Russian-speaking east. Police said they evacuated it peacefully after receiving reports it was booby-trapped with explosives. \u2022 Russia said that it had imposed a ban on the transportation of nuclear fuel across Ukraine due to \u201cthe unstable situation in the country\u201d. Russia, the main supplier of nuclear fuel to Ukraine, said its neighbour has enough fuel for its power plants to last until the end of next month. Russia, Ukraine\u2019s main supplier, has imposed a ban on the transportation of nuclear fuel across Ukraine due to \u201cthe unstable situation in the country\u201d, the Kiev post reports, citing Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin. It says Rogozin told a meeting between the president and government ministers today: We have problems with the transit of nuclear fuel through Ukrainian territory to our partners in Eastern Europe, and there are issues related to supplies of fuel to nuclear power plants in Ukraine itself The Ukrainian NPPs [nuclear power plants] have fuel reserves for March and April A ban has so far been imposed on such transportation of fuel due to the unstable situation in the country. Here is a link to details of that EU package agreed for Ukraine today,which the European Commission says will amount to \u201cat least \u20ac11 billion over the coming years\u201d. It will also include modernisation of the Ukrainian gas transit system, speeding up the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan and technical assistance on a number of areas from constitutional to judicial reform and preparation of elections. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that 35 unarmed military personnel are on their way to Ukraine to act as observers in response to a request from Kiev. Eighteen member countries of the OSCE, including the UK, US, France and Germany, have agreed to send up to two representatives each. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier said: It is my hope that this military visit will help to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine. By providing an objective assessment of the facts on the ground, the OSCE will be better placed to foster a political solution to the current crisis through dialogue. Here are some more comments from the UK foreign secretary, William Hague, on trying to bring Ukraine and Russia together today. What we\u2019re really trying to do here today is to bring the Russians into a diplomatic process. That is what we really want to see, at least the start of that. And I think it\u2019s right to try every diplomatic opportunity, our focus has been very strongly on trying to make diplomatic progress so that Russia and Ukraine work together, can discuss things together. That is the threshold. Adding: In our view a deescalation should include Russia abiding by international agreements that it has signed in the past, such as its forces in Crimea, abiding by the 1997 agreement on Black Sea bases whereby they would only be outside their bases with the agreement with Ukraine. He also said that is it important for the European Council, who meet tomorrow, to demonstrate that there are costs and consequences for Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine. He added that the most important consequences could be long-term. US secretary of state John Kerry told reporters that \u201cregrettably\u201d Russia had not appeared for a meeting of the so-called Budapest agreement group, which involves Washington, London, Moscow and Kiev. The Budapest agreement group was created to assure Kiev\u2019s security after it renounced nuclear weapons in the 1990s and the US and Britain had hoped to bring the two disputing parties together. UK foreign secretary William Hague said that he will make every effort to bring Russia and Ukraine ministers together later today. Russian President Putin said he did not want political tension to detract from economic cooperation with Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional partners\u201d, according to Reuters. He told cabinet members: We are seeing known political tension, it should not affect our current economic cooperation. He added: It\u2019s not necessary to add to the difficult situation, we need to cooperate with all our traditional partners - while providing for our own interests, of course. It is not necessary to whip things up. The Kiev Post\u2019s Christopher Miller has posted a video from Sinferopol in Crimea where he says a group of more than 50 men with Russian flags and shields who had gathered to block a Ukrainian military base attacked a group of peaceful women who came to protest their action and held signs reading \u201cLove, peace for all\u201d and \u201cDo you love Ukraine? Stop this!\u201d He writes: The men tore the handmade signs into shreds before shoving the women and some of their husbands and sons into oncoming traffic. Meanwhile, police stood nearby, doing and saying nothing. Some of the men attempted to break the cameras of journalists and shoved some of them into the street with the group of women. One man shoved a Kiev Post journalist into the hood of an oncoming car. Asked by the Kiev Post why he had done nothing, despite observing the action, a police officer said only: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the authority to investigate this.\u201d The European Commission has approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to \u20ac11bn \u0160tefan F\u00fcle, the European commissioner for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy, has just tweeted. Ukraine is in dire need of financial assistance. It has said it needs $35bn (25.5bn Euros) over the next two years to survive. A $15bn aid package agreed with Moscow last year after Viktor Yanukovych decided not to sign a wide-ranging association agreement with the EU was frozen after he was ousted. The US embassy in France tweeted this photo: Moscow continues its vigorous denials that Russian forces are occupying Ukrainian bases in Crimea. The German Embassy in London tweeted: The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, says he has agreed in consultations with the US and Ukraine that \u201cthere must be costs for Russia if they don\u2019t de-escalate\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s top security official said today that Russian forces have not made any new military gains in Crimea but warned of the danger of new attempts by pro-Russian protesters to take over government buildings in eastern and southern Ukraine. Andriy Paruby, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security and defence Council, told reporters: Last night there were already fewer emergency situations and fewer conflicts in Crimea. I hope that in the coming days a way will be found to solve everything through negotiations. The Associated Press\u2019s Laura Mills says a mine was found in the Donetsk regional government building occupied by pro-Russia supporters, which was evacuated by police today. BBC reporter Abdujalil Abdurasulov tweeted this photo of a Ukrainian ship being blocked in Sevastopol:\ufeff Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has repeated President Putin\u2019s claim that it is not Russian troops occupying military bases in Crimea. Speaking in Madrid in remarks shown on Russian television, he said \u201cself-defence\u201d forces who do not answer to Moscow were occupying the bases and so Russia could not order them to leave. Western states are discussing a potential resolution to the crisis under which Russia would pull back its forces to their bases on the Black Sea peninsula and allow in international monitors. Lavrov said that it was up to the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities whether to invite international observers in. Ukraine has invited observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to go to Crimea. They are tentatively expected to start work today. The Canadian foreign minister John Baird has compared the Russian invasion in Ukraine to the Nazi 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia. He said in an interview with CBC: The Sudetenland had a majority of Germans. That gave Germany no right to do this in the late 1930s. He added that: \u201cIf it\u2019s not war, it\u2019s akin to war\u201d and that the situation was \u201cright out of the Cold War\u201d. Hillary Clinton has also reportedly Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions to those of Hitler. This photo appears to offer confirmation that the Ukrainian flag is back flying above the Donetsk regional government building, where police have reportedly been removing pro-Russia supporters today. Russian forces seized two Ukrainian missile defence battalions in the Crimea region on Wednesday, Interfax news agency quoted a military source as saying (via Reuters). The Ukrainian defence ministry was unable immediately to confirm on the report, which quoted the source saying: We now expect the arrival of Russian missile specialists and pro-Russian activists who will have to persuade the Ukrainian military personnel to carry out joint combat duties. Russian MPs are working on a draft law to allow the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of European or US companies if sanctions are imposed on Russia over Ukraine, RIA news agency reported today. From Reuters: RIA quoted Andrei Klishas, head of the constitutional legislation committee in the upper parliament house, as saying the bill \u201cwould offer the president and government opportunities to defend our sovereignty from threats\u201d. He added that lawyers were examining whether the confiscation of foreign companies\u2019 assets, property and accounts would comply with the Russian constitution but said such steps would \u201cclearly be in line with European standards\u201d. Ukrainian police say they are evacuating the Donetsk regional government building, which has been occupied by pro-Russian supporters since Monday, Reuters is reporting. A police statement said the evacuation began after reports that the building was booby-trapped with bombs. It also says, citing witnesses, that the Ukrainian flag has been raised above the building, replacing the Russian flag, which had flown there since Saturday. Sergei Aksenov, the pro-Russian prime minister of Crimea, said his government refuses to negotiate with the authorities in Kiev, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti reports. It quotes Aksenov as telling Latvian radio station Baltcom: We don\u2019t consider this government that proposes talks to us to be legitimate, that is the main issue. Last week, Aksenov appealed to Vladimir Putin for help in \u201cguaranteeing peace and calmness\u201d. European Union leaders holding a crisis meeting on Ukraine tomorrow could impose sanctions on Russia if there has been no \u201cde-escalation\u201d by then, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. Fabius told France\u2019s BFM TV that such measures could include restrictions on visas, the assets of individuals and existing discussions on economic ties with Russia. He said: Let\u2019s start to initiate the path of dialogue, but at the same time tomorrow there is an EU summit and sanctions could be voted tomorrow if there is no de-escalation. I expect and hope that Russia will today tell us that there is a prospect for dialogue with a contact group. Fabius was speaking before hosting talks between his Russian, US, Ukrainian and other counterparts on the margins of a long-scheduled meeting on Lebanon in Paris. The United States and Russia will hold talks on easing east-west tension over Ukraine today, Reuters reports: US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will meet face-to-face for the first time since the crisis escalated, after a conference in Paris attended by all five permanent members of the UN security council. Nato and Russia will hold parallel talks in Brussels amid concerns that a standoff between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea could still spark violence, or that Moscow could also intervene in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. This was presumably on Monday when the rouble crashed to record lows. The central bank releases its interventions in foreign exchange markets only with a two-day lag. The former US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has compared Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine to those of Hitler in the 1930s, the Pasadena Star News, a Californian website, reports: Clinton made her comments at a private event benefiting the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Long Beach. \u201cNow if this sounds familiar, it\u2019s what Hitler did back in the 30s,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they\u2019re not being treated right. I must go and protect my people and that\u2019s what\u2019s gotten everybody so nervous.\u201d Good morning. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the latest developments: \u2022 Nato and Russia are due to meet today to discuss Ukraine. Nato announced the extraordinary session yesterday, saying it was requested by Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. \u2022 Ukraine has said that observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), which includes Russia, the US and Ukraine among its members, will travel at its invitation to the Crimea region. They are tentatively scheduled to start work today. \u2022 Russia and US have traded accusations over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin was dismissive of US \u201cthreats\u201d and said Russia was engaged in a \u201chumanitarian mission\u201d. Barack Obama said there was a \u201cstrong belief that Russian action is violating international law\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
