But many who work for themselves are at risk of an uncertain old age \u2013 or in some cases even poverty \u2013 because they are putting nothing aside for their retirement. When the priority is building your business, it is all too easy to push pensions aside. But the oversight could prove disastrous. Figures show that more than 60% of self-employed workers are not saving in a pension or long-term savings. (This compares with about 30% of employees.) Alarmingly, three in 10 self-employed people are saving nothing and have little or no safety net should they find themselves unable to work or if their business started to struggle. This is according to research by investment company Fidelity. Financial adviser Chris Wordsworth at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u201cWith no auto-enrolment into a pension scheme or compulsion to save as employees have, it is not surprising that this aspect of finances is so often overlooked by the self-employed. \u201cThe problem comes if you never get around to thinking about it. The longer you leave it, the less time you have to save and allow those savings to grow. The biggest message is to do something now, however small, and get into the habit of saving something each month.\u201d The numbers of self-employed workers have soared in recent years. There were about 3.3 million in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, but this had grown to just under 5 million by the end of 2018. More people, particularly those with caring responsibilities at home, are choosing to work for themselves so they can be more flexible and have a better work-life balance. Among this growing cohort is 39-year-old Kirstie Broughton from Essex. She worked as an events manager for a City firm for 15 years before leaving to have her daughter Amelia, now 16 months old. She is in the process of setting up a business offering private antenatal classes and services. She hopes being self-employed will give her greater flexibility now she is a working mum. The business, Blossom and Bloom Baby Services, is in its infancy and, as she is not yet earning anything from it, she says she is unable to save in a pension. But like many others, this is something she worries about. \u201cI can\u2019t save right now as I\u2019m still getting the business off the ground,\u201d says Broughton. \u201cIt will take about five years to pay off the money I\u2019ve used for training courses and the business set-up costs. But after that, all being well, I will look to start saving, possibly in an Isa to begin with. \u201cI know pension saving is important \u2013 there just isn\u2019t the cash in the budget at the moment.\u201d Wordsworth says all self-employed workers should aim to have a decent personal cash reserve before they start any long-term or pension saving. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a pot of easy access savings to call on, particularly for those with a variable income, who may have lean months or times with less work coming in,\u201d he says. With this in place, it is then advisable to look at different types of income protection insurance so you and your family are covered should the worst happen. Employees will typically have sick pay and other protection if they cannot work or are made redundant. By contrast, the self-employed do not, and any state help is likely to be minimal. When it comes to retirement saving and getting a plan in place, Wordsworth\u2019s advice is \u201ckeep it simple\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt may be that you want to keep the money aside in a cash Isa throughout the year and then decide before the end of the tax year what to do with it \u2013 whether that\u2019s moving it into an investment Isa for long-term growth, or a self-invested personal pension [Sipp].\u201d Rebecca Robertson, an independent adviser with Evolution Financial Planning in Southend, Essex, says people should not be put off by the jargon. A Sipp is just a way of saving in long-term investment funds. \u201cOf course, the main benefit of pension saving over Isas or other savings accounts is that you get the government\u2019s tax boost on top of your own saving.\u201d For example, if you put \u00a380 into a pension and you are a basic-rate taxpayer, the government will boost this through tax relief to \u00a3100. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim further money back through tax relief in their annual tax return. One alternative might be the new lifetime Isa, which also pays a government bonus on long-term saving. But you must be under the age of 40 to be eligible. Robertson says: \u201cThere are lots of options and it can feel daunting. But there\u2019s also help and advice out there if you need it. Now with digital or robo-advice, you can get good guidance about the best steps at a reasonable cost. \u201cThe worse thing is to do nothing out of fear or confusion.\u201d If you have old occupational or personal pension plans, now might be the time to review how they fit into your wider retirement savings and whether they are in the best place. But tread with caution and seek expert independent advice. Many occupational schemes have hidden benefits, for example, or the transfer value will not represent good value for money, so you will need to weigh up your options. \u201cMany self-employed people say they will sell their business, and that will fund their retirement,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cBut this is a high-risk strategy. Some businesses could be difficult to sell, they may be worth less than you think, and the selling process can take many years. I am concerned if this is someone\u2019s sole retirement savings plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
