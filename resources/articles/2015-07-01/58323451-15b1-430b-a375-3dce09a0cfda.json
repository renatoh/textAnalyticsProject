At 26, Walcott and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believe the England forward is fit enough to fulfil his potential but he will not be rushed into signing, even if it means starting the final season of his contract without a new deal agreed. Walcott signed a \u00a390,000-a-week agreement 18 months ago and is believed to feel he is now worth in excess of \u00a3100,000, in keeping with some of his peers. He said: \u201cMy agent has talked to the club, I enjoy playing for this club so I am just letting them crack on with things and I\u2019ll continue playing football. If it happens it happens. We\u2019ll just play the waiting game and see what happens but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long.\u201d Asked if he would be comfortable with talks dragging into the new season, he responded: \u201cDefinitely. It\u2019s not in my thought process at all. You don\u2019t want to dwell on it, you want to play well and if it happens it happens. \u201cI won\u2019t let that delay the way I\u2019m going to be playing this season. I can\u2019t let that affect me, I want to do well for this club.\u201d Walcott was speaking after opening the scoring with a clinical finish in Arsenal\u2019s comfortable 3-1 win over Everton in the final of the Asia Trophy in Singapore. It was his first pre-season appearance since a strong end to a frustrating campaign in which he was not assured a starting role after recovering from the cruciate knee ligament injury he suffered in January 2014. That problem kept him out of the World Cup and he did not play in the Premier League again until a substitute appearance against Burnley nine months later. He played only 14 league games last season, just four of which were in the starting lineup. He showed what he can do when he is fit with a closing day hat-trick against West Brom and the crucial opening goal against Aston Villa in the FA Cup final, when he was selected ahead of Olivier Giroud. Walcott was then strongly linked with a summer move to Liverpool while Chelsea wanted to take him as part of the Petr Cech transfer but now he has his sights set on rewarding Arsenal\u2019s loyalty with an injury-free season. He believes a player in his position should be scoring upwards of 20 goals and added: \u201cI didn\u2019t want the season to end. It was a frustrating season for me. When you have been out for such a long time, it is difficult to get into a winning team. \u201cIt\u2019s my first pre-season for two years now so I want to work hard and get fit. It\u2019s a really exciting year for myself personally and I think this team can go very far. I\u2019m always going to be judged on goals, I\u2019ve been very happy with my goal record when given the opportunity. That is all I can do.\u201d Reminded he is the club\u2019s longest-serving player and could celebrate his 10th anniversary in January, he said with a smile: \u201cMaybe I should be talking about testimonial times. I have always played with a smile on my face, always enjoyed playing for this club. It is one of the best groups I have been involved with. I want to be involved with that squad as well. I want to work really hard and make sure I\u2019m in that starting lineup come the first game of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
