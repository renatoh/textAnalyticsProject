Yes, it probably is In July 2007, I was called on my pay-as-you-go mobile by Fusion Telecoms of Oldham. It offered me an 18-month deal with Orange at \u00a340 per month, although it said I could claim cashback for 16 months as the contract progressed. I was offered an additional phone on an 18-month contract at \u00a340 per month, and told I could claim all of this money back as well. I thought I would be a fool not to agree, and my 10-year-old daughter was over the moon. Fusion Telecoms now seems to have disappeared and I can't get any cashback, so I am having to find \u00a380 per month, which I can't afford. CB, Exeter \u00b7 Fusion Telecoms was a mobile contract \"reseller\" and the cashback deal was with them. You signed two separate contract agreements with Orange for \u00a340 per month each, but Orange had no idea about the cashback deal you thought you had. Fusion Telecoms would have been on a commission from Orange but now seems to have effectively walked away from its cashback obligations with you. This is a massive industry-wide problem that Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, is trying to address, and they tell me that a voluntary code of practice, set up in July this year, is simply not working. I have spoken to Orange about your predicament and it has kindly come up trumps by reducing your contract to \u00a325 per month and switching your daughter to pay-as-you-go. Oldham trading standards has had many complaints about Fusion Telecoms and it is trying to track down the proprietors. In the meantime, Ofcom needs to use its regulatory powers urgently. As for consumers, anyone thinking of signing up to a mobile cashback deal should remember the old adage: if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. As this case clearly proves. Failing to deliver on my contract I ordered some furniture from Harveys at the beginning of July and was told delivery would be in six to eight weeks. I signed up for a finance deal with Black Horse to pay over three years at about \u00a370 per month. After 13 weeks I gave up with Harveys, who still hadn't delivered. They refuse to cancel the contract. What can I do? LP, Romford \u00b7 You had a contract with Harveys and part of that contract, you say, included delivery within a stated time. Harveys has not delivered and you are perfectly within your rights to pull out. It's a shame it doesn't appear to see it that way. Your saviour is section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The fact you have finance of more than \u00a3100 means Black Horse is also responsible for the breach of contract. I have spoken to Black Horse, which has frozen the finance arrangement and are contacting Harveys on your behalf. If the agreement isn't cancelled, let me know. Cold comfort when faced with this scam I am being threatened by some traders who unexpectedly knocked at my door and asked if they could fill in some potholes in my driveway. I was quoted a reasonable \u00a3200 but they then went ahead and sprayed my whole driveway with bitumen and spread some chippings on top. They are asking for \u00a32,500, which I have refused to pay, but I have now had a couple of intimidating phone calls. DI, Devon \u00b7 My advice is: never ever give work to anyone who cold calls. If you are being threatened, notify the local police on the non-emergency number and get a call reference number. This will help if the traders try to carry out their threats - though this rarely happens. You must complain to trading standards via Consumer Direct (consumerdirect.gov.uk or 08454 04 05 06) and the network of \"regional intelligence officers\" will pick up on this type of activity. It could even be referred to my trading standards \"Scambusters\" team. We are waiting for some funding from the government to carry on our pioneering work. Making solicitors account for the delay In May 2007 I sold my old flat and purchased a new one using Barnetts solicitors, based in Southport, for the conveyancing. In order for the exchange of contracts to take place, I had to give them \u00a3300 to cover possible service charge arrears on my old flat. It turned out there were no arrears but Barnetts still has my \u00a3300. SG, Essex \u00b7 I have spoken to Barnetts and they explained that they are still waiting for the finalised accounts from your purchaser's solicitors, which is where the problem seems to lie. Barnetts has chased them yet again and is expecting something this week, and your \u00a3300 will then, hopefully, be on its way back to you. If the money is not received soon, the next stage is for you to go to the Law Society to make a formal complaint about the intolerable delay - this is a free service. Go to legalcomplaints.org.uk Long and the short of extended warranties I purchased a TV from Comet for \u00a3300 in September 2004 and paid an extra \u00a3130 for an extended five-year warranty. The TV is now faulty and cannot be economically repaired. I have been offered a refund of the purchase price but not a pro rata refund of the warranty cost. Is this fair? CD, south-east London \u00b7 The terms of the Comet \"total product cover\" are quite clear on this point, and if you accept a refund voucher for the TV, your cover will end immediately. I can fully understand your view that you should also be entitled to a partial refund of the \u00a3130 warranty price for the unused portion, but that is not the way it works. To be fair, Comet has offered to replace the TV with a similar spec model, and transfer over the remaining two years of the warranty, which sounds reasonable. I would accept this if I were you. As a general rule, warranties can be very expensive and I always take the calculated risk of never buying one. Owing a debt of ... gratitude! I borrowed \u00a312,000 from Lloyds TSB about five years ago to help a relative pay off some debts. At the time, I agreed to take out loan protection insurance, and the premium was added to the loan and included in my monthly repayments. I managed to repay the loan early and settled up with Lloyds TSB. Last month I received a letter from the bank stating that they owed me \u00a31,895 to cover that part of the loan protection insurance that I didn't use. They are also going to add \u00a3390 interest from the date the loan closed. \u00b7 You should be absolutely delighted, but you complain that the interest is only calculated at a rate of 1%. You have mis-read the letter - the interest is calculated at the current base rate plus 1%, so take the money and enjoy it. I spoke to Lloyds TSB, who said that they do review closed accounts, and this is how your refund came to light. Anyone who settles a loan early might like to bear this good news story in mind.
