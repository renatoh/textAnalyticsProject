The group were on a bus of seasonal farmhands in central Mexico when apprehended in 2015 by immigration agents who targeted them because of their physical features, clothes and limited Spanish. The agents accused the four of being undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, but they were indigenous Tzeltal Mayans from the poor state of Chiapas in southern Mexico, where 25% of the population speak an indigenous language. Shortly after the ordeal, the Guardian revealed that three of the four \u2013 siblings aged 15 to 24 \u2013 were taken to a detention centre in Quer\u00e9taro in central Mexico and held for eight days. One of them, then aged 18, was beaten and given electric shocks until he agreed to sign a deportation document admitting they were Guatemalan, even though he cannot read or write. The siblings narrowly avoided being expelled from their home country after the fourth \u2013 the older sister\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 alerted a human rights organization. On Thursday, Mexico\u2019s current immigration (INM) chief admitted they were subjected to human rights violations as a result of racial profiling. \u201cOn behalf of the National Migration Institute, I offer this public apology, for the transgression of their human rights, for the damage to their image, honor and dignity caused by the actions of the migration agents,\u201d said Francisco Gardu\u00f1o Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. Six immigration officials, who have not been named, were suspended for two to four weeks for their role in the abuse, Gardu\u00f1o said. The apology does not mention torture, even though the Human Rights Commission in Mexico City concluded that Alberto suffered post-traumatic psychological symptoms as a result of being tortured. \u201cI really thought I was going to die, so I signed lots of sheets of paper \u2013 but I can\u2019t read or write so I didn\u2019t know what I was signing,\u201d Alberto told the Guardian through a translator in 2016. At the time, the INM denied the incident ever happened. As part of its package of reparation measures, the INM has also pledged to stamp out racial profiling by training agents in cultural sensitivity and human rights: \u201cThe institute is committed to ensuring that human rights violations like these do not happen again,\u201d Gardu\u00f1o said. The youngest victim, now 19, welcomed the news. \u201cGood. That means my younger brothers and sisters will be able to travel to Sonora to work,\u201d she told the Guardian through her lawyer. The supreme court will soon rule on the constitutionality of the current migration law, which permits agents to employ racial profiling on Mexican citizens who may not know the law, speak Spanish \u2013 or who are simply afraid of authorities, said Gretchen Kuhner, the director of Institute for Women in Migration (Imumi), one of the organizations representing the victims. Kuhner said: \u201cThe case demonstrates a larger pattern of abuse by INM agents who use racial profiling to harass indigenous and other Mexicans. In the current crackdown, Mexicans are even more vulnerable to these types of abuses by immigration agents and the new national guard.\u201d In recent months, thousands of troops have been deployed to help the INM detain migrants as part of a controversial deal in which President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador agreed to stop more migrants reaching the US border to avoid punishing US trade tariffs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
