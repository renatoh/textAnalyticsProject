These actions will not be tolerated and we will do everything in our power to find those responsible and put them before the courts.\u201d As far as City are concerned those words come a little late. A club spokesman said: \u201cWe believe there are questions to be asked of Merseyside police because there were enough warnings beforehand. What happened was avoidable and therefore unacceptable.\u201d Having been made aware of the likelihood of a hostile reception for the City bus the police changed the normal route as a precaution but then proceeded to allow details of the new route to be made public. Liverpool apologised immediately for the actions of a minority of their fans and City are not seeking any further sanctions against the club, though privately they are understood to be upset that the police could not manage a basic level of security when they knew in advance that a disturbance was likely. Uefa was monitoring the situation, and has opened disciplinary proceedings against Liverpool, charging the club in relation to the setting off of fireworks, throwing of objects, acts of damage and disturbance. The bus had at least one window smashed en route to the stadium and was deemed unusable for the return trip. The case will be dealt with by Uefa\u2019s control, ethics and disciplinary body at the end of next month. The City coach Manuel Estiarte posted footage from inside the bus which shows objects hitting it. \u201cNo words. Unacceptable,\u201d Estiarte wrote. Footage obtained by the Spanish television station Gol showed Pep Guardiola getting off the bus, giving the thumbs up to stewards and saying sarcastically in Spanish \u201cthanks for protecting us\u201d and then \u201cshame\u201d. Vincent Kompany, meanwhile, has claimed the tie is not over because the Premier League champions-elect can score five goals if required in the return. \u201cThere\u2019s not one single person at Manchester City who believes this game is over. Not one person,\u201d City\u2019s captain said. \u201cWe have to live with the consequences of this result but that\u2019s what makes football special. We had a very short period of time in this game where everything went wrong but the same can happen in the next game for the opposition.\u201d Kompany, who was absent when City beat Liverpool 5-0 in the Premier League during September, said: \u201cIf we need to score five, so be it. We\u2019ve prided ourselves all season on being the team that we are. The second half we certainly went back to being the team that we are. It was just for a very short period of time we threw a lot away.\u201d The City captain also called on his club\u2019s supporters to replicate the atmosphere that inspired Klopp\u2019s team at Anfield and appeared to intimidate the Premier League leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s everything,\u201d said the Belgium international when asked about the importance of next week\u2019s backing at the Etihad. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen. Big games, big nights, they have always shown up and this will be one of them. Fair play to Liverpool \u2013 their fans, the club, the way they lived up to this event, but it\u2019s our time to do it now.\u201d City would start the second leg as Premier League champions providing they beat Manchester United on Saturday but domestic ambitions, Kompany insisted, will not be a distraction from the daunting task ahead in the Champions League. The defender explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve got one chance to do it in the Champions League. In the Premier League we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to do the job. We\u2019ll make it a priority now for the next three days. Whatever happens on Saturday we will take the game extremely seriously, we know how important it is for our fans, but after that we will go back to this unfinished business we have got here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
