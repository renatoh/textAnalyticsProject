What he\u2019d seen, inside London\u2019s HMP Wormwood Scrubs and HMP Pentonville, was eye-opening. Prison was not the bloodbath that Hollywood had promised, nor the \u201cButlins for murderers and paedophiles\u201d that the tabloid press had raged about. But it wasn\u2019t as rehabilitative as earnest politicians had promised either. Instead, Cattermole found a system that was simultaneously underfunded and hugely expensive, that prioritised punishment over reform, and often doled this out through instances of banal cruelty \u2013 bad food, bad bureaucracy and incentive systems that pitted prisoners against each other. Upon his release in 2011, Cattermole wrote the guide he had needed inside. Advice such as: how to make salad dressing from tinned tuna and brown sauce. That the best paid job in prison is \u201cbiohazard\u201d (cleaning up your fellow prisoners\u2019 puke and blood). A reminder to cancel your standing orders for your phone or TV, so you don\u2019t come out to debt. That claiming to be a bedwetter won\u2019t get you a single cell as it once did \u2013 but hearing voices might. How to make \u201cjail velcro\u201d, a device made from a coat-hanger and a drawstring bag used to move objects between cells. That no one trades in cigarettes any more; it\u2019s all toiletries and tinned fish now. The right forms to fill in to make a complaint against an officer. Or that, if you land the right Albanian cellmates, they might make you yoghurt from prison-issue milk. (\u201cGoogle says this isn\u2019t even possible,\u201d says Cattermole, \u201cbut I saw it live and kicking.\u201d) He called it Prison: A Survival Guide. Once written, Cattermole enlisted a cleaner friend to make 1,000 copies of the book (illegally) using a photocopier in a Canary Wharf bank while on the nightshift. After a while, emails began coming in, from people who had been given a copy, thanking him for helping them access services they hadn\u2019t known existed, for making them feel less alone. Tory MP Priti Patel raged that the book made \u201ca mockery of our criminal justice system and proves the government must reform our prisons and make them tough and unpleasant places\u201d. \u201cEvery person who enters jail is a complete newbie. I just want people to be up to speed,\u201d he says now, sitting in his small Clapham home, surrounded by the aftermath of his job as a carpenter. He has made me toast and a pint-glass of tea, perhaps a little jittery about how a six-foot-seven ex-con is going to come across in a newspaper. He only makes eye-contact on occasion; a consequence from his time in prison and something he apologises for. You sense he\u2019d have been happy for his guide to have stayed an underground photocopy. From his perspective, Prison: A Survival Guide is \u201ca well-meaning book, a socially minded book\u201d. He adds: \u201cIf anyone from the Daily Mail wants to have a moan, I\u2019m trying to stop people from reoffending, because once someone\u2019s humanity is gone, it is a void to be filled with drugs and violence.\u201d Even after being \u201cnicked so many times I\u2019ve lost count\u201d and spending 10 months in 23-hour lock-up, Cattermole still broke the law when he came out, just to prove he could: \u201cMinor shit \u2013 it\u2019s juvenile, it\u2019s stupid. But there are so many people like me and it\u2019s reality. I don\u2019t like being oppressed, so I acted out.\u201d At his sentencing a year before, he remembers staring at the judge, \u201csome old man speaking Latin with some Jacobean leftover stuck on his head, thinking, \u2018Why does he want to control us?\u2019 And that\u2019s why the justice system doesn\u2019t work. They\u2019re old Etonians who have only ever been in trouble for stealing Jaffa Cakes from the boarding-school pantry and we don\u2019t respect their authority one bit.\u201d With an official publisher now on board, Cattermole has updated the book with insights from other contributors. Ex-prisoner Julia Howard explains the politics of being \u201cgay for the stay\u201d in a women\u2019s prison. Sixteen-year-old Darcey Hartley reveals what it is like having her dad Ian spend 14 years in prison under a since-abolished Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence. Sarah Jane Baker, the world\u2019s longest-serving transgender inmate, whose gender dysphoria was only recognised when she removed her testicles with a prison-issued razor blade, explains the bureaucratic process behind transitioning behind bars. Lisa Selby, whose partner Elliot is in prison, covers visiting someone on the inside \u2013 the sign language developed to speed up a cafe order, or dealing with separation anxiety. (\u201cYou\u2019ll hate seeing prison officers more intimate with your loved one than you can be \u2026 an odd form of jealousy!\u201d) The main thing Cattermole wants people to understand on the outside is how much prison has changed over the decades. \u201cIf you think it is some old-school, cockney bank robber locked up by some fat, jolly screw who will fight them and then have a cup of tea with them, in some bodged rehabilitative idea \u2013 none of that is true any more. It is a different type of person in prison now. You can go because you are homeless, because you are a squatter, for not paying your TV licence or sending your kids to school. The people working there are different \u2013 the senior officers are so sick of the stress they\u2019re leaving for kids armed with Tasers and tribal tattoos. Reform used to be about reducing prison populations, now Michael Gove is talking about building a massive, US-style super-prison.\u201d After his time inside, Cattermole is left with a rather grim view of what our prison system says about us. \u201cGandhi said that a nation\u2019s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members. If you judge England \u2013 not that I advise anyone to judge anyone, especially judges \u2013 but if you judge England on that basis, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d \u2022 Prison: A Survival Guide is published by Penguin on 20 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
