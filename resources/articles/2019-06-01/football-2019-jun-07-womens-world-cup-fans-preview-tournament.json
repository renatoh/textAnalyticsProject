The stadiums are fantastic and the atmosphere will be electric. We are ready. The host nation will be\u2026 aiming for the final. We have the talent and character to go all the way. The only thing that can become a barrier is expectancy. France can crumble under pressure. But there shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem winning Group A if we play well against Norway. Keep an eye out for\u2026 our playmaker Gaetane Thiney. There\u2019s plenty of young talent in the squad, but a lot of France\u2019s creativity will go through one of the veterans of the team. Naomi Nigeria My Super Falcons\u2026 could not have wished for a worse draw. France, Norway and South Korea should be too strong for us. I have a feeling\u2026 Nigeria will cause an upset or two. If that happens we should be able to progress with France to the knockout rounds. Opposition defenders will\u2026 be run ragged with the skill and pace of Asisat Oshoala and Francesca Ordega. They can provide the necessary inspiration. Ifeanyi Andrew Ibeh Norway The mood in Norway is\u2026 quite relaxed. We should progress from the group and lay to rest the ghosts of the horrible Euro 2017 campaign. A win over Nigeria will lift optimism. Our best player is\u2026 not playing. Ada Hegerberg\u2019s decision not to play for the national team continues to create debate. A negative interview just before the tournament hasn\u2019t been received particularly well. It\u2019s not what is needed just now. The team will do well if\u2026 they stick together as a group. And if winger Caroline Graham Hansen finds some inspiration. Ida South Korea My hope is\u2026 getting through the group. Quarter-finals has to be a realistic aim. My husband\u2026 is supporting his home team Germany. And, with England as a third choice, I\u2019m bound to be cheering on a finalist, right? I\u2019m looking forward to watching\u2026 Ji So-yun. If she finds form she can inspire this team towards the early knockout stages and beyond. Heejung Chung Germany Germany can\u2026 end up anywhere from a group exit to winning it. I got hooked on women\u2019s football during\u2026 the 1995 World Cup in Sweden. Manuela Goller was in goal and current coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg was also in the team. But let\u2019s not talk about Germany\u2019s final defeat to Norway. I love to watch\u2026 goalkeeper Almuth Schult and Dzsenifer Marozsan. She knows French football very well. From the other teams I\u2019ll be curious to see if Marta is still as good as she was in past tournaments. Helice Anvarsin Spain Women\u2019s football in Spain is\u2026 growing fast. People are finally taking an interest. The national team\u2026 won\u2019t be anywhere near the favourites, but they can definitely be a surprise package. A good result would be\u2026 getting to through to the knockout stages. Our most skilful players is\u2026 Our captain and midfielder Amanda Sampedro. Under her leadership we have talent and motivation to do something big. Javier Perez Australia Before the tournament I am\u2026 Nervous. We have a great team but go into the World Cup on a massive losing streak. We don\u2019t seem able to string good games together. Australia have\u2026 the best squad we have ever fielded in a tournament. We may have lacked consistently lately but on our day we are very strong on paper. Maybe saving the best for when it matters? Our smartest player is\u2026 Sam Kerr. She\u2019s smart off the ball and creative on it. Her goal scoring ability will be a key factor too. I\u2019m very excited for her. Katie Brazil Our team is\u2026 Not in the nicest place right now after nine defeats in a row. The coach has been criticised for putting players out of position and it\u2019s just not working. My hopes rest on\u2026 my country\u2019s love of football. The sport is in our DNA. I believe and hope our love for the game will make a difference on the pitch. It will be sad to say goodbye to\u2026 Brazilian legends Marta, Formiga and Andressa Alves. They are true icons for a lot of young girls in Brazil. They broke many gender barriers, but have never been able to win the World Cup. This year I hope it gets to be a really special one for them, and for us. Isabella Queiroz Italy For Italy to be at the World Cup is\u2026 already a result. Italian football has not been very kind to the women\u2019s game. Just look at the comments made by the Italian football association not so long ago. We can thank\u2026 our biggest league clubs for keeping the women\u2019s game moving. The standard of the women\u2019s game has increased dramatically. We stand no chance against\u2026 Brazil, but I\u2019m more confident of frustrating Australia and beating Jamaica. Our most inspirational player is\u2026 our captain Sara Gama. The symbol of what women\u2019s football can be in Italy if we get our act together. Riccardo Tesla Jamaica I expect\u2026 a decent showing in the group games at our first ever Women\u2019s World Cup, but I would also be surprised to see us go any further. A lot of our hopes rest on\u2026 our strong and fast striker Khadija \u201cBunny\u201d Shaw. And I hope goalkeeper Sydney Schneider has packed her gloves. She will be extremely busy. Dennis Jones Argentina The country hopes that... the team will not be in France just to make up the numbers. There is little expectation and that might work in our favour. The main target will be... not ending up pointless. And learning from the experience. Women\u2019s football in Argentina is miles behind other competitors and I fear this might show in the games. We need to show spirit. Getting through the group would be... an absolute miracle. Just look at what we\u2019re up against. England and Japan will surely be too strong, and Scotland will be tough too. I just can\u2019t see it. We should be content with a gracious exit and three committed performances. Ezequiel Japan I really hope Japan will\u2026 go all the way to the World Cup final. It would be their third in a row. But the semi-finals is the minimum requirement. The mood in Japan is\u2026 optimistic. There\u2019s a lot of love for the national team here and anticipation is clearly building. The country lacks\u2026 strong female role models in sport. As a teacher in Kawasaki I see sport in school clearly being the domain of boys. I hope that a positive tournament can raise the profile of women\u2019s football further and will have a knock-on effect in promoting women\u2019s sport. This could be the tournament for\u2026 Yui Hasegawa to shine. The midfielder is on the verge of a breakthrough and this could be her summer. Gareth Bell England England should\u2026 top their group easily. The only real competition will come from Japan. The real test will come\u2026 in a quarter-final. That would potentially be against host nation France. After that things would get more and more difficult with an unbeatable looking USA in a potential semi. You never know what might happen though. This is football after all! I\u2019m looking forward to seeing\u2026 Nikita Parris. She has been superb in the run-up to this World Cup. Hopefully Fran Kirby can recreate the magic from Euro 2017. And I\u2019m excited to see what playing for American teams has done for Toni Duggan and Jodie Taylor. Maybe they have some insider knowledge! Esme Coward Scotland We would do well to\u2026 avoid any thrashings in the group stage. Argentina should be beaten, but England and Japan look far too strong. I\u2019m proud of\u2026 how we have continually improved for the past seven years. Just being at a World Cup is progress, and reward for lots of hard work. We have a world class player in\u2026 Kim Little. Missing the Euros two years ago cost us, and it will be great to see her play a key role in a major tournament. Erin Cuthbert also has a good eye for goal. Jen Watt Cameroon Cameroon will\u2026 once again try and be competitive but fail to get out of the group. The second round can be reached if\u2026 Michaela Abam, Gabrielle Onguene and Alexandra Takounda have the tournament of their lives. Elume Raymond Canada Our success is built on\u2026 our defence. We\u2019ve only conceded one goal in eight matches so far in 2019. The centre-back partnership of Kadeisha Buchanan and Shelina Zadorsky has been rock solid. Our downfall is definitely\u2026 a lack of goals. We\u2019ve only scored eight goals in those eight games and three of them came in a friendly victory over Mexico. There\u2019s certainly quality going forward, with the likes of captain Christine Sinclair and Manchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie, but they have struggled to create and finish chances. The odds of getting out of the group stage are\u2026 favourable. Cameroon and New Zealand are must win games, and if we can deal with the Dutch duo of Miedema and Mertens defensively, then we\u2019ll have a chance of topping the group. But only if we find our scoring boots. Our defensive qualities will get us\u2026 to the quarter-finals. A repeat performance of 2015 is on the cards. Being solid at the back can only take you so far. Jithvan Ariyaratne Netherlands With a bit of luck\u2026 the semi-finals or even the final can be in reach. Last week\u2019s 3-0 win over Australia has proven that Oranjeleeuwinnen can match any opponent I started playing football\u2026 when I was four years old. I was the only girl at a club with over 600 boys. In the summer of 2017\u2026 the streets were coloured orange. The women\u2019s success at Euro 2017 was the definite breakthrough of the women\u2019s game in the Netherlands. Suddenly the media couldn\u2019t get enough of them. Maybe we have another extraordinary summer before us? Keep an eye out for\u2026 Netherlands\u2019 attacking style. Danielle van de Donk can both create chances and finish them and Jackie Groenen captured the nation\u2019s heart two years ago. She\u2019s outstanding on the ball. Sophia New Zealand Football has\u2026 made some serious inroads in New Zealand in the last couple of years. It\u2019s not all about rugby anymore. The Football Ferns will see this World Cup as\u2026 a hugely challenging tournament. Having to face Canada and the Netherlands in the group stage is cruel. What I like about this team is\u2026 its balance. There\u2019s plenty of quality in the ranks. I\u2019m picking them to get out of the group. But to do that we need to make sure Cameroon is not the only team we beat. Aaron Alexander Chile We have\u2026 an outside chance of making the second round. Getting something against USA will be tough, but if the stars align for us we might get a draw against Sweden. Beating Thailand is possible, but they have a minor advantage of having won a World Cup game before. Four points should be our goal. The team looks\u2026 hungry. All the media attention is focused on the shenanigans of the men\u2019s team prior to Copa America, so I think that has helped ease any pressure on the women\u2019s team. The star of the team is\u2026 our goalkeeper Christiane Endler who plays for PSG. She will have some busy moments, but I hope we don\u2019t see her too often. Alvaro Valenzuela Sweden We should\u2026 reach the second round without any problems. But the games in the knockout stages should be more evenly matched. A realistic ambition is\u2026 the quarter-finals. Then we\u2019d have to squeeze past Germany or the USA. It will be interesting to see how we fare against them in the group game. That should give us an idea of where we are at. My local club IK Sirius\u2026 has been represented by both Sweden\u2019s Nathalie Bj\u00f6rn and Canada\u2019s Allysha Chapman. It will be fun to watch them in France on the big stage. A shoutout to Brazil\u2019s Marta too, who I hope bows out in style. David Ekstrand USA Our squad depth\u2026 is unmatched by any other team. That\u2019s why I believe the trophy will be ours again. I had the opportunity to be at the World Cup final in 2015 and it was the most amazing sporting event I\u2019ve ever been to. All of the 23 team members\u2026 would start for any of the other nations in the tournament. Our defence is not\u2026 Fort Knox but they will still be a match for most attackers in the World Cup. Plus our offence will be incredible from start to finish. The shirt I bought for the tournament\u2026 has Julie Ertz\u2019s name on the back. She\u2019s a force to be reckoned with in midfield.
