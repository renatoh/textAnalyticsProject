Spiegelworld, one of Las Vegas\u2019s biggest variety producers, is staging an extravaganza in Edinburgh this week before transferring back home to a purpose-built theatre in September. Its Atomic Saloon Show, a circus-variety show \u201cset in a wild west neon disco\u201d and featuring acrobats and dancers in gravity-defying acts, was meant to have been the first of five annual productions created and premiered in Edinburgh, but its producers are now having to consider relocating their European base to Berlin or Paris. Ross Mollison, Spiegelworld\u2019s circus impresario, said: \u201cUncertainty is the enemy of strategic planning. Our business at light entertainment already has so many uncertainties. Are people going to buy tickets? Are they going to like it? How are we going to build new shows? \u201cTo add to that, this whole Brexit thing. The uncertainty of what is the law, what is the visa situation, what happens with visas next year if you\u2019re not part of the EU? I have no idea. It\u2019s just another thing we have to worry about. It\u2019s very disappointing that, on the eve of us launching this show, this debate is still going on.\u201d He added that, while the circus had done shows in Edinburgh for 20 years on and off, this was the first created in the city ahead of a big Las Vegas run: \u201cWith the uncertainty, I doubt that we\u2019ll come back next year unless everything is resolved and we know exactly what we\u2019re buying into. \u201cThis is a show built for Vegas in Scotland. But if we don\u2019t know what the rules are, we can\u2019t come back and do it because these investments are insane amounts of money,\u201d he said. Spiegelworld is an adult-themed circus, burlesque and vaudeville extravaganza inspired by 19th-century European cabarets. Its previous show, Absinthe, has played for more than eight years in Las Vegas, where it draws half a million people a year. It has also toured worldwide. Atomic Saloon Show\u2019s world premiere is in Edinburgh on Thursday. Its producers promise \u201cthe most abnormally sexy but sensationally amoral troupe of entertainers on Earth\u201d. If Spiegelworld cancels its plans, there will be financial losses for Scotland. In bringing a company of 40 to Edinburgh for four weeks of rehearsals before its month-long show opens, it spends money on accommodation, set construction, rehearsal space, and local specialists. It is described as one of Edinburgh\u2019s biggest shows of the past 20 years. Productions on this scale are too expensive for most British producers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
