The 33-year-old midfielder becomes a free agent in the summer and Pep Guardiola concedes he is unsure whether Tour\u00e9 will remain part of his plans next season \u2013 but the Ivorian appears in no rush to leave. \u201cI came to this club to make history,\u201d said Tour\u00e9, who after spending some time on the fringes of Guardiola\u2019s squad, is back on centre stage. \u201cI want this club to change, I want this club to be bigger than United. I know it\u2019s going to be a lot of work but that\u2019s my dream.\u201d With controversies surrounding Tour\u00e9\u2019s divisive agent, Dimitri Seluk, seemingly smoothed over and his fellow midfielder Ilkay G\u00fcndogan having sustained a serious knee injury, Guardiola appears set to be heavily reliant on a player he excluded from City\u2019s squad for the group stages of the Champions League. Tour\u00e9 could not be more delighted at the prospect of resuming his once-pivotal role between now and May \u2013 and perhaps for even longer. \u201cI like the challenge, I love a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make something very important. I have already won two Premier League titles and I want more than that, another new story. \u201cI feel 20 now,\u201d he added, smiling. \u201cMy role is to keep the team moving, win the ball, organise, talk to the players, I have the experience. We are a team that wants to play football but sometimes you have to tell the players to be careful, especially on the counterattack.\u201d This desire to influence matters from the heart of the action made Tour\u00e9\u2019s time on the bench far from easy. \u201cI belong on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even if I\u2019m not playing I want to be at the stadium to watch. Even when I\u2019m going home, I\u2019m thinking about my football and what I did and how I played and what I could change. I always want to progress. \u201cOf course, I want to be involved but it depends on the manager. I will be fully prepared for any situation. I will give 100% for this club, for these fans. These fans are the only ones who always sing my name, who give happiness to my family. If I can do more for them I will do it. I always fight to make the team one step better.\u201d After working with Guardiola for two years at Barcelona, Tour\u00e9 has been intrigued to see how the 45-year-old is coping with the culture shock involved in transferring his coaching talents to English football. \u201cI think he\u2019s seen how difficult this league is physically but he\u2019s a very intelligent guy, he understands football very well,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cHe always has to win, to conquer a league, but he\u2019s seen that here in England it\u2019s complicated because, as we\u2019ve said before, in England you need to be very strong in the second balls, and also the third and the first balls. The manager\u2019s idea is that we have to be like Barcelona. It\u2019s going to be difficult but with a lot of work we\u2019ll continue that way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
