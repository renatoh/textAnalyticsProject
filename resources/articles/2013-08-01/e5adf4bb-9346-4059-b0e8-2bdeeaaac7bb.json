Sir Michael Stoute's colt, who missed the Derby in June with a minor injury when fancied to run very well, was an embarrassingly easy winner of his most recent start at Leicester, when Telescope was 24 lengths clear of Mulakim at the line, but the form has not been seriously tested, he is stepping up to Group Three and all-aged company and he is odds-on to do so successfully despite this being a much more demanding assignment. Telescope (2.55) is certainly a short price on his bare form to date but there is one point which weighs very heavily in his favour. The time of Telescope's race at Leicester would have been exceptional for an ultra-competitive, high-grade handicap, never mind a three-runner event in which the winner was clear from a long way out. The evidence of the clock is that Telescope is very much a Group One horse for the autumn and, as such, he should be able to take Saturday's race in his stride. Ascot 12.55 The mile handicap won by Ascription at Glorious Goodwood has yet to produce a subsequent winner but Jack's Revenge was in front of all bar the easy winner and started from one of the widest stalls on a course where high numbers are a big disadvantage. The excellent Gerald Mosse takes the reins today. Ascot 1.30 Brockwell was behind Broxbourne, who re-opposes today on 5lb worse terms, over two miles and five furlongs at Goodwood last month but made up plenty of ground in the straight and can turn round the form. Lightly raced for a four-year-old, he looks to be the best chance on the day for the leading Japanese rider Yasunari Iwata. Ascot 2.05 A competitive sprint at the minimum trip for the eclectic assortment of riders contesting the Shergar Cup but Racy has a very straightforward style and is in top form, having finished fourth, and first in the main group, in the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood. Back at five he will be hard to catch. Haydock 2.20 A fiercely competitive race but Sennockian Star could be the answer if he is sufficiently recovered from a hard race at Ascot last month. It was just a four-runner contest but Sennockian Star was a decisive winner, the time was excellent and the third horse home has since improved to win a good race at Glorious Goodwood. Off just a 6lb higher mark, Mark Johnston's runner has at least one more decent prize in him. Ascot 2.40 Chesterfield has improved with every one of his three races to date and looked a potential Pattern horse last time. A 6lb rise in the weights is unlikely to stop him. Ascot 3.15 Fortune has rarely favoured Willie Wag Tail over the last season and a half and he has had a stop-start campaign this time too. He has often looked to have a big handicap in him, though, and Kieren Fallon could be the man to coax him to victory here. Newmarket 3.35 Amazing Maria will be popular following an impressive success at Glorious Goodwood but that was only a maiden and she is taking a big step up in class. At the likely prices it could be worth opposing her with Ihtimal, who ran well in a Listed race at Royal Ascot last time. Ascot 3.50 Jadanna saves her best form for this trip and is only 1lb higher than when finishing a good second in a solid time at Ripon last month. James Doyle is a very useful and experienced partner too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
