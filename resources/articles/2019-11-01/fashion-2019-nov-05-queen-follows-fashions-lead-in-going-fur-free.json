The news comes after similar announcements from a glut of big names in fashion. Italian fashion house Gucci announced it would go fur-free in 2017 and auction off all its remaining animal fur items. In 2018, London fashion week became the first of the big fashion events to commit to banning fur. When Prada announced it would stop using fur in its collections in May, activists hoped the move would reignite a campaign that had taken its foot off the pedal. Most recently, Macy\u2019s announced it would stop selling fur items by February 2021, making it the biggest US retailer to do so, and last month California became the first US state to ban animal fur products. News that the Queen is following suit has been welcomed by animal rights activists. \u201cPeta [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] staff are raising a glass of gin and Dubonnet to the Queen\u2019s compassionate decision to go fur-free,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s director of international programmes, Mimi Bekhechi, who called the new policy \u201ca sign of the times, as 95% of the British public also refuses to wear real fur\u201d. Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society International, called the Queen\u2019s decision to \u201cgo faux\u201d from now on \u201cthe perfect reflection of the mood of the British public, the vast majority of whom detest cruel fur, and want nothing to do with it\u201d. Her Majesty is no stranger to fur \u2013 she wore leopard-skin stoles in the 1950s and attended the opera draped in fur in the 40s. Peta used the news to call on the Queen to rethink the fur worn by members of the Queen\u2019s Guard and \u201ccomplete the policy by ordering that the fur be replaced by the humane, luxurious faux bearskin that Peta has helped develop alongside faux-furrier Ecopel and designer Stella McCartney\u201d. The Humane Society International called on the government to make the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of fur. Kelly\u2019s book has also brought to light claims that the royal dresser wears in the Queen\u2019s shoes before engagements, \u201cto ensure they are comfortable and that she is always good to go\u201d; that the Queen requested to say the line \u201cGood evening, Mr Bond\u201d when she appeared alongside Daniel Craig during the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, and that she was very happy to share a hug with Michelle Obama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
