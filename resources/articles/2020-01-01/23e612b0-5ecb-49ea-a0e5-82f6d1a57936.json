Now it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the NFC Championship Game, which David Lengel has already begun covering over here. Thanks to everyone for following out liveblog of the AFC Championship Game. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, FINAL The Chiefs are going into victory formation here. The crowd goes crazy and time goes off the clock, and well they should as the Kansas City Chiefs are headed to Super Bowl 54. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 1:20, 4th quarter And there\u2019s a false start on the Titans, so forget about those five yards they just got from the Chiefs\u2019 penalty. Tannehill throws to Humphries, who picks up nine yards before getting taken to the ground. Tannehill\u2019s next pass is incomplete. We\u2019re at 3rd &amp; 6, Tannehill throws a rather nifty throw but Mathieu manages to break it up. That\u2019s 4th &amp; 6 and probably the game for the Titans. The Chiefs get Mahomes to run and he isn\u2019t able to play Houdini here and he finally goes down. That\u2019s a turnover on downs and this one is over. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:00, 4th quarter A hands in the face penalty gives the Titans a first down and five yards. That will put them at their own 31 but they only have two minutes between them and elimination. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:08, 4th quarter The Chiefs gets a delay of game penalty. The punt goes into the end zone and so does one of the refs, who accidentally gets knocked down by a Chiefs player. He stays in the game however. The Titans start at their own 20 here. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:20, 4th quarter The officials call a \u201ctoo many men on the field\u201d penalty on the Titans, one they missed on the previous play. Not exactly the refs\u2019 finest moment today. Because there was no play, the Titans get their timeout back though. Williams gets stuffed on two consecutive drives. It\u2019s 3rd and 9 here for the Chiefs. Mahomes throws it incomplete to Mahomes, so the Chiefs are going to punt it and give the Titans a chance at a miracle ending here. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 3:46, 4th quarter Mahomes launches one and draw a flag on Tennessee. That\u2019s pass interference for 41 yards and, more crucially, an automatic first down for Kansas City. Williams is stuffed for a loss and the Titans take another timeout. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:07, 4th quarter Williams gets pushed out for no gain. That\u2019s exactly what Kansas City didn\u2019t want to do here. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 10 and no time has gone off the clock. Mahomes gets sacked on the next play, the Titans call a timeout. A three-and-out here would be titanic. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:18, 4th quarter Hill fields the Titans punt and brings it to the Chiefs 19 where the Kansas City will start what they hope will be a super-slow, methodical drive. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:18, 4th quarter The fake punt breathes new life into the team here. Tannehill throws to Smith for eight yards and then throws to Davis, that\u2019s good for 22 yards. The Chiefs manage to sack Tannehill on 2st and 10 but on the very next play, Tannehill connects with Firkser. It\u2019s a touchdown, scored in a near blink of the eye, which is exactly what the Titans needed here. The extra point? It\u2019s good and we still have got a game going here. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 5:00, 4th quarter Oh it\u2019s a fake punt! Punter Brett Kern finds Amari Hooker for 28 yards and a first down. The Titans are still alive, they\u2019re at the Kansas City 50. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 6:22, 4th quarter The Titans are going to need to score here and they\u2019re going to have to do it super-fast. They\u2019ll start at their own 20, where Henry will be tackled for a loss of six. That was the exact opposite of what they needed there. 2nd &amp; 16 now. Tannehill has to air it out and he nearly finds Sorensen for a catch but they just don\u2019t connect. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 16. Smith is stopped well before the first down. It\u2019s 4th and 8 and Vrabel is\u2026 punting. This feels like kinda giving up here. That was a 50 yard catch for Watkins and it looked even longer because this has been such a run-heavy game. Of course, as they say, establishing the run makes passing even more effective. The Chiefs can just beat you too many ways. Yes I\u2019m rattling off cliches here, but sometimes cliches exist for a reason. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 7:33, 4th quarter Williams again on the next two downs, gets to the Chiefs 40. It\u2019s 3rd and 6 and a chance for the Titans to get a stop and get the ball back. Instead Mahomes throws an incredible rainbow of a throw to Sammy Watkins. Mahomes makes the catch and gets to the end zone. There\u2019s a call against the defense on the play, but the Chiefs are going to obviously decline that and take the touchdown. The extra point is good and that\u2019s probably the knockout blow against Tennessee here with less than eight minutes left on the clock. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 9:02, 4th quarter Mahomes throws to Watkins for a 11-yard gain. They\u2019re on their own 24 and have yet another first down. Williams goes off, gets five yards. 2nd 7 5, Mahomes finds Watkins who has to spin around to connect with the pass but does so with almost balletic ease. That\u2019s yet another Kansas City first down. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 11:13, 4th quarter I misspelled \u201cbunt\u201d as \u201cpunt\u201d that last entry, my apologies. The baseball cheating scandal is still on my mind probably. Back in the football game, Williams picks up a yard and Titans head coach Mike Vrabel uses one of his timeouts. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 12:05, 4th quarter The Titans have to punt and they do nail the Chiefs to their own 12 yard line. That\u2019s a start, now they need to make sure that the Chiefs don\u2019t go on another long, productive drive. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 12:48, 4th quarter The Titans need points here, they don\u2019t need to go for the touchdown immediately. They just need\u2026 oh and now the announcers have copied what I was going to say here. They just need to get a little bit closer. It\u2019s a touchback. On 1st down, Tannehill finds Davis who gets them to their own 40. Not a bad start, but on the next carry Tannehill passes to Henry who takes a two yard loss. Tannehill finds Brown for 5 yards. It\u2019s 3rd and 7 and the pressure pushes Tannehill down to the 45. Huge, huge stop by the KC defense. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 14:50, 4th quarter Mahomes first pass is to Sherman, who can\u2019t quite catch it. No worries, he just hands it to Williams again and he\u2019s into the end zone. Touchdown Chiefs! The extra point is good. It\u2019s a two possession game for Kansas City. Been all about the ground game, really. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, end of the 3rd quarter 1st &amp; 10, Williams gets four yards and only then does Mahomes go back to the passing game, finding Hill for 15 yards. It\u2019s 1st and goal at the Tennessee 3 at the end of the third. It feels like the dam is about to break for the Titans. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 1:13, 3rd quarter Darwin Thompson goes off for seven yards. Since it\u2019s working out for him quite well, Mahomes decides to run again and it\u2019s another outstanding effort. He gets 11 yards to the Titans 22 and it feels like all the pressure is on the Titans. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 3:18, 3rd quarter Williams gets the ball one more time, this time just a mere yard, before Mahomes finally throws, this one\u2019s to Watkins who gets to the Titans 47 but not a first down. It doesn\u2019t matter, Mahomes takes care of the ball on his own, taking off and getting that fresh set of downs. Hill runs for seven yards here, the Chiefs are at the Tennessee 40. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 5:11, 3rd quarter Williams gets six yards on his first carry of the drive. Williams again gets the ball and he gets three yards here. 3rd &amp; 1, which is quite manageable for the Chiefs, who go to Williams for the third straight time. That\u2019s a first down that will take them to their own 41. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 7:01, 3rd quarter Hardman returns the Titans punt to the 27 yard line, so that\u2019s where the Chiefs will begin. As uptempo as this game has been, it\u2019s weird to see two straight possessions without scoring. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 7:01, 3rd quarter Chiefs have too many men on the field, which is a five yard penalty that will make this 1st &amp; 5 situation for the Titans, who give it to Henry who\u2019s good for four yards. Henry can\u2019t quite get the first down on his next carry here, so it\u2019s first and extraordinarily short here. The Kansas City defense gets their stop but there is a flag on the play. It\u2019s a holding call on the offense. It\u2019s 3rd and 11. Tannehill has to scramble here on the next play, but unlike with Mahomes in the first half, there\u2019s nothing going and he\u2019s tackled well before the first down. It\u2019s 4th and 4 and the Titans elect to punt. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 9:47, 3rd quarter The Titans will start their first drive at their own 21. Henry gets three yards on first down. 2nd &amp; 7, Tannehill throws a ground-bouncer. 3rd &amp; 7 here while Arrowhead gets loud. This time around, Tannehill is able to throw a super low throw that Humphries is able to cradle and keep from hitting the ground. That\u2019s a first down. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:40, 3rd quarter Mahomes scrambled for the first down. The Chiefs are keeping this alive for another set of downs. They\u2019re at their own 47 where Mahomes throws one to Thompson but the two aren\u2019t on the same page. That\u2019s incomplete and that\u2019s 2nd &amp; 10. The Kansas City defense gets to Mahomes and it\u2019s a 3rd and 10 and the Titans have a shot here at shutting the Chiefs down. 3rd &amp; 10, Mahomes tries to find Hill but it bounces just out of his hands. Chiefs have to punt here and the Titans get a crucial stop here. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:40, 3rd quarter Well, they did call it a catch, so that\u2019s a first down. Williams picks up eight yards on the next play. Good challenge by Reid there. I\u2019m going to guess the call will stand, if only for insufficient evidence. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:58, 3rd quarter Mahomes scrambles for a bit, but this time he doesn\u2019t get away with anything and he simply throws it away. 2nd &amp; 10. Next play, Robinson gets to the seven before going out of bounds. 3rd &amp; 3. Mahomes has plenty of time and does find Watkins, but gets called out-of-bounds. Replay makes it look like he was in bounds, but it might not be enough to overturn it. Andy Reid has challenged it regardless. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 14:20, 3rd quarter Williams picks up seven yards in his first run of the second half. On 2nd &amp; 3, Williams gets the first down. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 15:00, 3rd quarter After a penalty, the Chiefs will start at their own 10. This feels like the perfectly correct analysis here. The Titans might be playing at close to their best football here and that just might not be enough if Kansas City doesn\u2019t slip. I mean, what exactly happened here? It\u2019s the eternal question: great play or defensive breakdown. Gotta say, there were elements of both here. For most of the first half, the Titans looked right in this but the Chiefs, as they tend to operate, are definitely back in control. How their first drive of the third quarter goes might tell us a lot about whether this continue to be a close game or if this is set up for a blowout. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, end of the first half Tannehill will just take a knee to end the first half. The Chiefs are ahead and they will have the ball to start the second half. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, :11, 2nd quarter Mahomes throws it incomplete on the next down. On his next play, it looks like he\u2019s trying to find a receiver but can\u2019t quite find a spare second to stop and throw. It looks like he\u2019s doomed but he finds an exit somehow, like an escape artist working on the fly after his Plans A and B have all failed. He not only runs for the first down, which would be astounding enough on its own, but the end zone itself. That\u2019s a touchdown! The extra point is good! That was ridiculous! Titans 17-14 Chiefs, :54, 2nd quarter The Chiefs are at the Titans 45, where Mahomes scrambles to pick up 7 yards. Mahomes\u2019s next throw goes incomplete. On 3rd and 3, he finds Watkins and they\u2019re at the 27 yard line. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 1:09, 2nd quarter Mahomes finds Williams again, this one\u2019s a gain for 8 yards. That means it\u2019s 2nd and 2, He gets the pass to Hill who weaves back and forth for what ends up being a loss of about three yards. 3rd &amp; 4 and a good chance here for the Titans defense. Except not, Mahomes finds Kelce for a first down instead. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 1:42, 2nd quarter Oh hey we\u2019re getting a punt here. I almost forgot those were a thing. Jordan Lucas gets the ball at the 23 but there\u2019s a holding penalty on the play that will push them back to the 14. Mahomes doesn\u2019t mind too much, he connects with Williams for 17 yards. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 2:00, 2nd quarter Raymond gets 20 yards on the kickoff. Henry gets the ball and Henry actually gets stuffed for a mere one yard gain. Credit Chris Jones on defense for that. The next time around, it\u2019s no gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 9 and we might not actually see scoring this drive. Tannehill finds Dion Lewis, who doesn\u2019t make it to the first down. That\u2019s Tennessee\u2019s first three-and-out. Kansas City will get the ball back at the two minute warning plus they will get the ball at the start of the third quarter. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 4:03, 2nd quarter Mahomes throws it away on 1st down. 2nd and 10, Mahomes finds Hill who waltzes into the endzone. How\u2019s THAT for a quick answer. The extra point is good and, you know what, this is looking like it\u2019s going to be fun. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 5:03, 2nd quarter On the next play, there\u2019s illegal contact called on the Titans defense for an automatic first down. They\u2019ll be on their own 42. Mahomes finds Demarcus Robinson who gives them 24 yards. Mahomes then finds Watkins for 13 yard gain and this is what Kansas City\u2019s offense does: eats up yards very quickly. They\u2019re now at the Titans 20. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 6:32, 2nd quarter Hardman goes off on a 35 yard run right up to the Chiefs 37, where they will start their next drive. Williams gets the ball and picks up a mere yard. I normally try to avoid writing run-on sentences but it was hard not to on that particular sequence for the Titans. It was really a series of interconnected \u201cand then\u201d plays. Just a seamless flow of play calls. Rather impressive, taking over nine minutes of play time. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 6:39, 2nd quarter Henry picks up four yards and then they bring in Marcus Mariota for a play here, he picks up five yards to get the Chiefs 2. On 3rd &amp; 1, Tannehill is back in the game and Henry never left. He gets to the Kansas City 2 and it\u2019s 2nd and goal. With all the attention on Henry, Tannehill finds Dennis Kelly instead for the touch down and the Chiefs are up 10 after the extra point is good. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 9:05, 2nd quarter So, now that\u2019s 1st and 20 and ouch Tyrann Matthieu hits Davis for a two yard loss. That\u2019s 2nd and 22 and this drive is going backwards. Tannehill\u2019s next pass is incomplete. 3rd &amp; 22, there\u2019s a completion short of first down BUT there\u2019s a flag. Let\u2019s see what this is Oh man, pass interference on the offense. Automatic first down and the Titans drive stays alive. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 10:39, 2nd quarter Henry picks up fie yards. Tannehill finds Brown again to get them the first down at the Chiefs 13. They look to be in control, but there\u2019s a flag on the next play. That\u2019s holding on the offense and that\u2019s a 10 yard penalty. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 12:30, 2nd quarter Tannehill goes deep but just a bit too deep. It\u2019s an incomplete pass. He gives it to henry who gets 3 yards. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7\u2026 and there\u2019s a neutral zone infraction on Kansas City. Yet another avoidable Kansas City penalty and it makes it 3rd &amp; 2 and Tannehill finds Humphries for a first down. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 13:46, 2nd quarter The five yard penalty doesn\u2019t hurt them, as Tannehill finds Corey Davis for an 18 yard gain and then gets it to Henry who barrels through for a 13 yard gain and just like that, the Titans are right at the Kansas City 40. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, end of the first quarter The Chiefs kick off and it\u2019s a touchback. The Titans start at their own 25 as a result, Tannehill finds MyCole Pruitt for a nine yard gain. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 1 and, right before the first quarter is set to come to an end, the Titans get a false start penalty for 5 yards. Not\u2026 not a pristine way to end the first fifteen minutes here. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 1:46, first quarter Mahomes makes a spectacular throw to Kelce almost in the end zone, but it\u2019s out of bounds. There is a call on the Titans\u2019 defense. That\u2019s a five yard penalty and an automatic first down. On his next pass, Mahomes gets it to Hill and he gets it in for the first Kansas City touchdown. Now that\u2019s how you respond. The extra point is good. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 1:35, first quarter Hardman picks up 8 yards. And they\u2019re at the 16 now. On 2nd and 2, Williams gets to the 13 for another first down. This is more like the Chiefs we\u2019ve seen. Tennessee\u2019s Rashaan Evans is injured on the play. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 2:54, first quarter The Chiefs are keeping the offense on the field. Probably the right move given the situation and it absolutely works out as Mahomes finds Kelce for a first down to put them on the Titans 24. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 2:58, first quarter Mahomes just throws the ball away on first down. His next pas s is to Sammy Watkins, who can\u2019t finagle it. It\u2019s 3rd and 10 here, Mahomes scrambles and finds Travis Kelce, it\u2019s 4th and 2 on the Titans 28. The Chiefs take a timeout to decide what they\u2019re doing here. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 4:28, first quarter And THERE is Mahomes, who throws a deep pass to Tyreek Hill who just barely gets the catch, that\u2019s a 26 yard game and in an instant they\u2019re on the Tennessee 36. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:09, first quarter Williams picks up three yards for Kansas City\u2019s first 1st down of the day. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:46, first quarter The good news for Kansas City is that they have a love of time and they know they can put up pinball numbers. Hardman is here to return the kick and he gets about 19 yards to get them to their own 26. Mahomes finds Damien Williams for a nine yard gain on first down. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:52, first quarter Tannehill finds Jonnu Smith for a 22 yard gain, and on the next play, they hand it to Henry and he drives into the end zone for the game\u2019s first touchdown. And the extra kick is good. The Titans are up 10 early and it\u2019s looking like the Chiefs will once again look to dig themselves out of an early hole. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 7:13, first quarter Henry can only squeak in about a yard on second down. It\u2019s 3rd and 2 and a big task here from Kansas City\u2019s defense. And they do a decent job, Tannehill\u2019s pass gets blocked by Terrell Suggs. Because of their kicking situation, partly at least, the Titans decide to go for it on 4th and 2. And they get it! Adam Humphries with a three-yard catch to get them to the Kansas City 26. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:09, first quarter And now the Titans get the Chiefs to commit encroachment and that\u2019s an extra five yards for the Titans, who are in a 1st &amp; 5 situation. They give it to Henry who picks up about two yards on the carry. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:35, first quarter The Titans draw the Chiefs offsides for a five-yard penalty which gives them an automatic first down without having to call an actual play. Pretty sneaky sis. That will just be an incomplete pass. It\u2019s now 3rd &amp; 5 for the Titans. Life in the \u201cWhat Is Even A Catch\u201d League: Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:40, first quarter They decide to go with Henry again, because why not, and he gets them half-way to another first down picking up 5 yards to get to the 42 yard line but Tannehill\u2019s next pass is intercepted by Kansas City\u2019s Bashaud Breeland. Or is it? The play is under review to see if hit the ground and is therefore an incomplete pass. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 9:29, first quarter Henry with his first big run on the day, a gain of eleven for an easy first down. It\u2019s like watching a knife cutting through butter. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 10:09, first quarter And the Titans will start at their own 42 after a Kalif Raymond run for about nine yards. That\u2019s pretty decent field percentage. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 10:14, first quarter And Mahomes is sacked by Kamalel Correa for a loss and his next pass ends up incomplete. That\u2019s a good defensive stand for Tennessee. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 11:29, first quarter Mecole Harman takes the kickoff to the Kansas City 21, where the Chiefs will start their drive. Mahomes scrambles under pressure and picks up two yards. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 11:33, first quarter Tannehill throws three straight incompletions and the Titans bring out the field goal unit. Greg Joseph, who has barely been used, hits a 30-yarder to put Tennessee on the board, but that could have gone worse for the Chiefs. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 12:25, first quarter Henry gets another yard on his next carry. Tannehill finds Corey Davis for a first down and then hands off for Henry who picks up four more yards to get them to Kansas City\u2019s 12 yard line. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 14:18, first quarter Derrick Henry gets fours yards on his first carry. On 2nd &amp; 6, Tannehill passes to A.J. Brown who goes off for 37 yards. The Titans are right there on the Chiefs\u2019 29. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 15:00, first quarter And we\u2019re off, the Titans will start around their own 35 after bringing in the opening kick. Kansas City wins the toss and they have decided to defer. The Titans will start the game on offense, while the Chiefs will get the ball coming out of halftime. National Anthem It\u2019s performer by retired Navy officer. Generald Wilson. He has a nice, resonant voice and doesn\u2019t try to do too much with it in the beginning untl the very end with an extended \u201ctheeeere.\u201d 8/10. The Chiefs are being introduce on the field, so we\u2019re getting closer to actual game time here. Am I... am I the only one getting nonstop ads for Mike Bloomberg? I am the exact opposite of a stick-to-sports guy, but I am not sure if I need to think about the 2020 primaries any more than I already have to. I will post anything Malkovich related. The NFL Today guys are giving their predictions now. I always wonder if they talk early beforehand to make sure that they don\u2019t all give the same picks. It\u2019s 3-1 for Kansas City among the announcers, which sounds about right: the Chiefs should be favorites but not writing off the Titans completely. Today\u2019s big celebrity guest? That would apparently be Paul Rudd. Will he be doing the war chant? Because, uh, that sounds like it will backfire. The winner of this game will go on to face the winner of the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. This feels like it will be a closer game, if we could be guaranteed to see the Aaron Rodgers of a few seasons ago I would have no hesitations about chosing the Packers but I think the 49ers, who will be playing at home, have the edge here. Predictions Man, it\u2019s just hard to pick the Titans here. The Chiefs are clearly the better team on paper and it looks like a complete mismatch. However, we could have said that before their games against New England and Baltimore. Still, my gut is telling me that there won\u2019t be much drama here after the second half, if the Chiefs find a rhythm here I don\u2019t see the Titans being able to fight back. I hope I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s way more entertaining to covers these games when there\u2019s lots of drama, but I\u2019m going with Chiefs 41-17 Titans. Have your own predictions? Feel free to send them our way, either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (to @HunterFelt). Andy Reid Okay, here\u2019s one potential area of concern for the Chiefs: Head coach Andy Reid\u2019s team has gone 1-8 lifetime against the Titans. On top of that, his record in championship games? 1-5. The Chiefs are going to want to have a decent lead built up by the end of the fourth quarter because Reid is notoriously bad at clock management in key games to the point where it\u2019s become something clich\u00e9. If the Titans pull off the upset today, there\u2019s absolutely going to be some questions on Reid despite his inarguable NFL success. Email from Ezra Finkelstein: This hasn\u2019t got the attention it merits, but Tenessee Titans\u2019 kicking situation is by far the worst in the teams that made the playoffs. They made 1 out of 15 last attempted Field Goal attempt, began the year with Codey Parkey, he of double doink noiterity and wil be in big trouble if a kick is the option late on the game. Perhaps something to watch for. One wonders if this will effect their decision-making, Field goal range might mean something different for them. Preamble Welcome all to the AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the\u2026 wait, hold up, the Tennessee Titans? While it was a relatively safe bet that the Chiefs would make a deep playoff push, the Titans were not really expected to make it this far. Especially not whey had to knock off both the reigning Super Bowls champions in the New England Patriots and then the almost certain league MVP in the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson. On the road, no less. An impressive feat from a Titans team didn\u2019t even win their own division, they placed second in the AFC South behind the now-eliminated Houston Texans, yet here they are just a win away from an improbable Super Bowl appearance. This will Kansas City\u2019s biggest challenge yet, however. Thanks to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs\u2019 offense looks nearly unstoppable. They fell behind to a 24-0 hole against the Texans during the AFC Divisional Round, only to bounce-back to win 51-31, rattling off 41 unanswered points during one stretch of the game. While he was overshadowed by a regular season injury, not to mention Jackson\u2019s rise and a stellar year from the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Russell Wilson, Mahomes continues to be one of the most dangerous threats in the league and will have a bigger arsenal of weapons than the Jackson of the Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady had. The Titans, however, have a Hulk or at least the closest thing to one in running back Derrick Henry. Henry has been so dominant that he\u2019s practically rewritten the rules of being a RB, rushing for at least 180 yards in his three last games. Henry has been so good that quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who replaced a struggling Marcus Mariota during the regular season, hasn\u2019t thrown for more than 100 yards in either playoff game. With Henry on this side, he has been able to help his team win while working primarily as a game manager. He might not get that luxury in this AFC Championship Game. The Chiefs are going to put up numbers against the Titans, so they will have to prove that they can keep up with the Chiefs offensively. It\u2019s a tall task, but after the previous two games, it\u2019s foolish to completely write off their chances. In the meantime, you can send us your thoughts on today\u2019s NFL action either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via tweet (to @HunterFelt). It\u2019s the AFC Championship Game between the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead stadium. Kickoff is scheduled at 3:05pm EST, but I\u2019ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime, here\u2019s our preview of today\u2019s game: What the Titans need to do to win: Ummm, avoid blowing a 24-0 lead? The Titans should bear in mind that, despite Patrick Mahomes\u2019 heroic performance during last Sunday\u2019s destruction of the Houston Texans, Ryan Tannehill and co are more than capable of beating the Chiefs. In fact, they did so in November, and that was with Mahomes playing at the height of his considerable powers. Back then Tennessee won the day by doing the simple things well: Tannehill was interception-free, special teams chipped in with a blocked field goal in the 35-32 victory and Brett Kern pinned the Chiefs back in their own territory with a 51.0-yard punting average. And then of course there was Derrick Henry, who ran for 188 yards, with the Titans outrushing the Chiefs by 225 yards to 97. Side note: Andy Reid is 1-8 all time against the Titans. What the Chiefs need to do to win: In short, if Mahomes plays well they\u2019ll probably win. Having said that, the Titans are not a great match-up for the Chiefs: Henry has been brilliant this postseason, Tannehill is a threat with his legs too and the Chiefs had the seventh-worst rushing defense in the league during the regular season. (Having said that, they were good at stopping the Texans on the ground last week.) But even if the Titans do maul them on the ground, Mahomes has the ability, and the weapons, to outscore pretty much any team in the league.
