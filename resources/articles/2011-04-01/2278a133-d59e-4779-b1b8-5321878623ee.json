Carroll will face his boyhood club on Sunday for the first time since his January move from St James' Park, providing he overcomes the knee injury that kept him out of the 5-0 defeat of Birmingham City, with the manner of his deadline-day transfer still a contentious subject on Tyneside. At the time, the Liverpool striker claimed he had been forced out of Newcastle once the club decided to accept a record sum for a British player. He even travelled down to Merseyside in time for a medical in the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's helicopter. Alan Pardew, the Newcastle manager, denied Carroll's version of events and Dalglish believes it will show the esteem in which the 22-year-old was held at St James' should fans turn against their former favourite. \"They will do whatever they want, but it won't take away from what he has done for their football club and it won't take away what the football club meant to Andy,\" said the Liverpool and former Newcastle manager. \"It is a compliment really, in a strange way, if you do get abuse because it means you must have been important to them. \"I'm sure when Newcastle signed Alan Shearer they didn't give too much consideration to Blackburn Rovers fans but that's football. What goes around comes around. I don't know what they will do on Sunday but if, as a player, you don't get abuse off your old supporters then they can't have been too disappointed that you left. I think the boy is expecting something.\" Carroll arrived on Merseyside with a thigh injury, which delayed his Liverpool debut for five weeks, and a controversial reputation following several high-profile incidents off the pitch. But Dalglish says the striker's character is the only surprising discovery that Liverpool had made in their \u00a335m investment. \"I don't think we have found out anything new about his game,\" said Dalglish. \"Even if you go back to his first goal against Manchester City, he rattled in one like that against us earlier in the season. We knew what we were getting before Andy came in. What you don't know to the same extent is the personality and if there is one thing that has pleasantly surprised us it is the boy's personality. He is a real down-to -earth boy who sometimes doesn't realise he is a footballer but that is because he is naive and has his feet firmly fixed on the ground. That is not a criticism. That is a huge compliment to him.\" Dalglish described Carroll's availability for Sunday as a \"wait and see\" process, although the England international, who damaged a knee at Arsenal almost a fortnight ago, was free to join several team-mates and Everton's Tim Cahill at the Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Barcelona on a day off on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
