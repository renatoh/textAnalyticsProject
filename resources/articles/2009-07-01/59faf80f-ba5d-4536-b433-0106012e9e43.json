The controversial breakfast presenter's remarks come after media watchdog Ofcom censured him in March because of complaints he made homophobic comments about gay singer Will Young, and he faced criticism for remarks about Auschwitz. \"The BBC is in a very weird state where they just don't want to upset anybody,\" Moyles said. \"Everything now needs to be signed, sealed and approved 18 times. We're not trying to change the world, but because radio is so dull, so boring and so formulaic, and anyone different \u2013 me or Jonathan [Ross] \u2013 stands out,\" he told Radio Times. \"So the BBC is throwing down rules and regulations on you and then the newspapers are saying certain things and you're just trying to juggle everything while keeping everyone happy at the same time. And the reality is that you can't keep everyone happy all the time.\" The BBC, which publishes its annual report today after a turbulent 12 months, introduced compliance rules following the \"Sachsgate\" incident, when Radio 2 broadcast offensive messages left by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand on actor Andrew Sachs's answerphone. Brand, Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas and head of compliance Dave Barber resigned, while Ross was suspended for three months. New rules include barring radio presenters from reading out listeners' text messages on air without prior approval from producers. Moyles, who will appear in the BBC1 genealogy show Who Do You Think You Are?, was criticised in January after making comments about Auschwitz. He told listeners then: \"I went off to Ireland and other places to film and, unlike a lot of the Who Do You Think You Are? shows, I didn't go to Auschwitz. Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida.\" Radio 2 DJ Paul Gambaccini called for Moyles to be sacked, saying he found his \"continual presence on Radio 1 unacceptable\". Moyles said he was \"genuinely quite surprised\" at the reaction to the comments. \"I think what happened is that there are some people whose view is that you can't say that word [Auschwitz] in any other context than what a horrible thing happened there,\" he said. \"And it wasn't about anything that had happened at Auschwitz at all. If everybody who had done Who Do You Think You Are? turned out to be related to royalty, I'd have said, 'Hey! It turns out I'm not related to royalty!' If in every show, in every series, they drove a blue car, it would have been about that\u2026\" He added that \"most intelligent people\" would have interpreted his comment correctly. \"A lot of it is people \u2013 the haters \u2013 using it as an attack on me,\" he said. \"There are many perceptions of me, most of them false or exaggerated. The tabloidy version of me is this controversial, outrageous, almost inhuman character. Then there's the side friends see, which is kind of socially inept. I just come alive for three-and-a-half hours every day on the radio. At the end of the day, I'm a guy on the radio, trying to make people smile on their way to work, or college or whatever. And I think I do it very well.\" Moyles said he didn't believe Who Do You Think You Are? would change people's opinion of him, which he said was of \"that horrible man from the radio\". \"I don't think the programme will radically change people's perception of me, but I don't care either, because it changed a lot for me. It's a story that I'm proud to tell. The only other thing I'd say is that I cry at the end. I am human.\" Question marks have been raised about the future for Moyles, who has an average weekly audience of 7.7 million listeners for his three-and-a-half-hour show, with the presenter denying a report he would be axed later this year. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said in March that Moyles would keep his job if he \"stays within the rules\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
