Not us, say Watford", "bodyText": "Asked at one point last season why any team in the Championship appeared capable of beating any other, the Wolves manager, Mick McCarthy, suggested with his customary succinctness that it was because they were all equally rubbish. While there were qualities one could admire in this game - Albion's passing and movement during short periods of the second half; Watford's determination throughout - there were too many moments when you could not help feeling the Yorkshireman's words were equally applicable in 2007-08. The goals were a good example: Leigh Bromby's opener for the Hornets and Leon Barnett's equaliser came about through defenders ball-watching and losing their man at set pieces. Basic stuff, but Albion - occupying one of two automatic promotion places - have been vulnerable in this respect all season. \"If I could put my finger on why we're doing it, we wouldn't be doing it,\" sighed Albion's manager, Tony Mowbray, which is not very promising. In the case of Watford - with promotion ambitions of their own - perhaps the manager, Aidy Boothroyd, will bring in enough new faces to transform a team of honest but limited triers into a side which can create chances and score goals against defences capable of remembering their training-ground drills. Nerves were not to blame, said players on both sides. As the Albion goalkeeper Dean Kiely pointed out, you either stand up for the big games or you shy away, and he thought all their lads stood up. Watford's aim, Bromby said, has to be to win their last three games. Would that be enough, given Albion and Hull City have a game in hand? Given the number of points the other teams will probably drop in the run-in, you can only think it almost certainly would. Having picked up just 11 points from the past 11 games, however, the odds against them beating Crystal Palace and Scunthorpe at home, and Blackpool away, would be pretty long. \"I probably would have taken three points off the top with three games to go at the beginning of the season but because we started so well and went eight points clear you hear words like fumbling, stumbling, whimpering Watford - but we're not, we're still in there,\" said Boothroyd. West Bromwich face McCarthy's Wolves at Molineux tomorrow, then Norwich away, Southampton at home, and Queens Park Rangers in London.
