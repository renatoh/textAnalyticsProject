The scheme would separate future immigrants into three tiers with entry for exceptional and talented people, skilled workers with a job offer, and unskilled for short-term schemes. Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King\u2019s College London and senior fellow at the research group UK in a Changing Europe, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not radical. Most likely it will not look that different from what we have now. \u201cThere\u2019s a damaging misconception in this debate that there\u2019s a binary divide between the brain surgeons and the people who pick strawberries \u2013 most ordinary immigrants are somewhere in between. Doing jobs that require skills but aren\u2019t necessarily highly skilled, and they would not pass this particular test. \u201cButchers, for example, or people who work in abattoirs \u2013 this is hard work and you need training. Most come from eastern Europe but are unlikely to make the highly skilled cut.\u201d He said \u201cAustralian-style\u201d was a phrase that performed well in focus groups, which is why Labour\u2019s then immigration minister, Liam Byrne, chose to use it as far back as 2007, because it implies regulation and control, yet Johnson\u2019s plans do not include the one element that would make it distinctly Australian, Portes said. \u201cIf you score certain points for your qualifications then Australia will let you in without a job offer. Johnson isn\u2019t proposing that for the UK. If he was then that would be radical,\u201d he said. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said Johnson\u2019s proposals went \u201croughly in the direction we were expecting the system to be heading [after Brexit] anyway\u201d. She said they equated to \u201ca relatively mainstream immigration system of the kind that you would find in relatively high income countries that don\u2019t have free movement\u201d. Sumption added: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more restrictive than free movement, so for certain employers there would still probably be difficulties transitioning from a system where there\u2019s no bureaucracy attached and where they can hire people very easily to one where they\u2019d have to hire people temporarily or not at all. \u201cI don\u2019t want to suggest that there\u2019s no change. It is a more restrictive system than the one we have now, on the whole. But, by international standards, I would say it\u2019s a relatively mainstream system.\u201d Johnson had earlier been accused of lying to voters over his election pledge to reduce immigration levels. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the EU\u2019s free movement of people had been good for the UK, and criticised the prime minister\u2019s proposal to give the migration advisory committee (MAC) the power to set quotas and hand out visas. \u201cHe is misleading the British people, because he\u2019s tried to give the impression he\u2019s going to bring immigration down, but when you look at the details of what he has announced today, he is saying you\u2019ve got to hand over decisions on who will get a visa to an independent committee,\u201d Ashworth told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \u201cThere will be no accountability over any decision that any immigration minister makes, because they will be handed over to a statutory independent committee. So again, Boris Johnson is lying to the British people.\u201d As well as an enhanced role for the MAC, the Conservatives will publish an annual report on how to reduce the level of immigration. Johnson has insisted the Tories will bring down numbers. Net migration was 258,000 in 2018. Asked if he was happy for immigration to go up, Ashworth said: \u201cIf the economy needs it then of course people should come here to work.\u201d He also highlighted the government\u2019s decision to extend the fee for workers from abroad to use the NHS, even if they are staff members, to workers who migrate to the UK from the EU27 after Brexit. \u201cWe should have a fair and balanced immigration system, of course we should, but he is imposing a tax on nurses coming from the EU and beyond to come and work here in our NHS, to care for our sick and our elderly,\u201d Ashworth said, adding that this would exacerbate the NHS staffing crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
