And here is the latest. When the health minister Simon Burns, waiting his turn in a queue for coffee at Portcullis House, made reference to peppermint tea as \"lesbian tea\", what did that mean, exactly? We tried to get to the bottom of it, for we were told that the MP for Chelmsford used the phrase in declining an offer of peppermint tea. But he says that wasn't how it happened. He doesn't drink tea. How did it happen then, we asked. Did you say it? \"I may have done, but not in the general queue,\" he said. Why, we asked. What was the context? He grumbled about people overhearing private conversations. Have you ever referred to lesbian tea, we asked. \"I am familiar with that phrase,\" he said. \"I was told that mint tea was often known in the restaurant trade in a colloquial term.\" We offered to send him some. He said no, don't bother. Overall, a funny business. \u2022 Though it must have been a trial, libidinous Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock hasn't let the scandal of his affair with a former researcher accused of being a Russian spy end his interest in the former Soviet bloc. According to the latest register of members' interests, Hancock flew to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, in September for a three-night stay. He prices the package at a modest \u00a31,500 \"to attend a conference and celebration on the 20th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan\". He travelled to a land of contrasts \u2013 plenty of torture, the human rights bods say, but also a lot of oil \u2013 as the guest of the \"Association for Civil Society Development in Azerbaijan\", derided by some as a front organisation for the president, Haydar Aliyev. Every international observer thought Aliyev's 2010 election was fixed, yet the association declared the vote \"fair and transparent\". And the MP no doubt enjoyed his stay, untroubled by the British media. Who'd bother him there? The government quite happily throws journalists in jail. \u2022 While Big Dave is standing by Theresa May, it does seem as if many a Tory heart is hardening against the home secretary. Witness the ire of Peter Bingle, chairman of Bell Pottinger public affairs; the man banned from the Soho House club this summer because he couldn't/wouldn't dress casually. \"In the Thatcher years, Theresa May would have been a PPS,\" tweets Bingle. \"She is a sad indictment of modern politics. She is hopeless.\" Grrr. Another tweet. \"What is the point of Theresa May? Is (sic) she wasn't a woman would she be home secretary? Sorry she hasn't clue. What an indictment!\" Now he's spluttering. \"In the good old days Theresa May would have resigned.\" \"What has happened to the old Tory party? She no longer has the trust of Joe Public.\" He's one disappointed man and obviously up for trouble. The ousted UK border force chief Brodie Clark should give him a ring. \u2022 Another frustrating PMQs for Ed Miliband, facing the open goal left unattended by Theresa May. So how is Ed doing? Not so well, says Robert Worcester, lord of the polls at Mori. \"It's really depressing\" news for Ed Miliband as \"he's on the same tracking\" as John Major and Iain Duncan Smith at their low points as leader of the Conservative party. Sir Bob, a former Labour pollster, said it was rare for a party leader to recover from such poor approval ratings. So that's that, then. Not quite, says Frank Dobson MP, in a letter sent last week to David Cameron and, as a morale booster, to colleagues in the parliamentary Labour party. For the stats, according to Frank, \"show both Ed Miliband and the Labour party polling better in Ed's first year as Labour leader than David Cameron and the Tories were doing in his first year as Tory leader\". Both interpretations drawn from figures gathered by Mori. So how's Ed really doing? God knows. \u2022 Finally, through the magic of freedom of information, we can tell you that despite the cutbacks, David Cameron, Kenneth Clarke and Eric Pickles all continue to subscribe to Dirty Des's Daily Star. What we can't say is why."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
