Rahman, who snatched Lewis's world heavyweight crown earlier this year, accused Lewis of a \"gay move\" over his legal action to force a rematch between the two fighters. When challenged, Rahman insisted that he \"never intended to question his [Lewis's] sexuality\". Oh really? Perhaps Rahman could enlighten us on why it is \"gay\" for Lewis to go to court to get him to honour his contract? Since the term \"gay move\" does not figure in any Law Society text book, it is not unreasonable to assume that Rahman used it with some other, probably dishonourable, intention. Lewis has not helped things by rising to Rahman's bait, demanding that he \"stop using that gay tag. If you think I am gay, bring your sister\". This sexist jibe in response to a homophobic one was ill-advised. It damages Lewis's otherwise well-deserved \"Mr Nice Guy\" image. The over-the-top denials by Lewis beg the question: why is he making such a fuss? Surely it fuels the rumours and makes people wonder why he has such a sore spot about his sexuality? Lewis gave grist to the gossip-mongers when, in April this year, he inadvertently outed himself in a Radio Times interview: \"How can they call me gay? I'm 120% a man's man\". We know what he was trying to say but these misjudged words gave more ammunition to his accusers, who tried to suggest that Lewis's slip of the tongue revealed what he had been long denying. In the same interview Lewis added: \"I've realised if you're famous they always say you're gay, so let them. I'm no longer bothered.\" But, of course, he is very bothered indeed - hence his continuing, highly publicised insistence that he is not gay. Realising that the sneers about his sexuality are affecting him, I wrote to Lewis in January this year, warning that some of the tabloids were \"digging for dirt\" about his sexuality. Goaded by his ostentatious denials, they are convinced he has something to hide. I urged him not to feed their suspicions by making such a fuss, and to maintain his own dignity. When confronted by these allegations, I advised: \"Be evasive if you must, but please do not go down the road of denial. It will only demean your integrity.\" I still stand by that view. Lewis's denials are demeaning. If someone accused him of being part-Jewish, he wouldn't turn it into a big issue. By denying he is gay over and over again, Lewis implies that being homosexual is something shameful. His attitude reinforces prejudice. A far better way to respond to his accusers would be to ridicule them. Why are they so obsessed with his sexuality? Perhaps their obsession reveals something about their own screwed up sexual desires? People who make anti-gay jibes are small-minded bigots. They deserve to be treated with the same contempt as racists. Lewis is a victim of double standards. By not condemning the homophobic slurs against him, the boxing profession gives a green light to prejudice. But it would never tolerate comparable overt racism. Imagine the furore if a white opponent was taunting Lewis over his race. The sport's governing bodies would, quite rightly, take action. Why, then, are they allowing boxers, managers and promoters to stir up anti-gay prejudice? Their collusion with homophobia brings shame upon the sport. It makes boxing look nasty and cheap. Right now, Lewis stands alone. He is not getting the backing he deserves from his fellow boxers. He has to sort out this one for himself. My advice to Lewis is this: ignore the rumours and concentrate on winning back the heavyweight crown. Do not be so hyper-sensitive. Most of the public could not care less whether you are gay or not. They just want you to regain your world title and bring sporting glory to Britain. Achieve that and you will be a hero. No one will care whether you are gay, straight, bisexual or celibate. That brings me to the \"what if\" scenario. There is no evidence that Lewis is gay. But what if he was? Staying in the closet puts sports stars under huge psychological pressure. It often has an adverse effect on their performance. In the early 1980s, I was friends with the gay black footballer, Justin Fashanu, who later killed himself. When we first met, Fashanu was still closeted about his homosexuality. The strain of keeping his gayness a secret was one of the factors that contributed to the downturn in Fash's football career. There are, today, several top British sports stars who are gay. They worry constantly about being found out. Most want to go to gay clubs and parties, but fear being recognised. Instead, they lead lonely, unfulfilled personal lives, always looking over their shoulder and dreading a tabloid outing. Some go to absurd lengths to project a straight image, even to the extent of having phoney girlfriends. It is not a pretty sight. If Lewis was gay, he would be better off coming out. Being open rarely has the dire consequences that people fear. For Lewis, it would relieve the burden and strain of leading a secret double-life. He would be more relaxed and much happier. To have an openly gay world class sportsman like Lewis would be brilliant. There are no current world champions in any sport who are openly gay. Lewis would be a trail-blazer, and a hero. The idea of Lewis coming out is, of course, just a fantasy. But it does not stop me wishing that Lewis was gay and out. Leaving aside the ethical issues concerning boxing, my dream scenario would be for Lewis to thrash the daylights out of Hasim Rahman in Las Vegas tomorrow night, and then come out on live television. It would be an act of great courage and dignity; the equivalent of Jesse Owens braving racist prejudice to win gold in Berlin in 1936. Lewis would become one of the all-time great sporting legends, on account of both his record in the ring and his guts in facing down the notorious homophobia of the boxing scene. If Lewis was gay and came out, he would win huge respect. People admire honesty and courage. Lots of top pop stars have revealed their gayness, including George Michael, Elton John and Neil Tennant. It has not harmed their careers one iota. The black gay community needs a positive role model. None of the major black celebrities are open about their homosexuality. There are no big-time openly gay black actors, politicians, sportsmen or pop stars anywhere in the world. It would be a tremendous boost for black lesbians and gays to have a hero like Lewis. He could play a hugely important role in challenging intolerance and promoting understanding. Sadly, it is only a dream. \u00b7 Peter Tatchell is a campaigner on gay and other human rights issues"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
