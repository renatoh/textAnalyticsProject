United's manager insisted he was simply on holiday in Rome with his wife. \"I am not here to spy out Nesta but to watch a great match,\" the Corriere della Sera quoted him as saying. Cash-strapped Lazio, who were knocked out of the Champions League at the first group stage and have disappointed in Serie A, are reportedly resigned to parting with Nesta, who has been a symbol of the team in recent years. Lazio have been in talks with Juventus over an asking price of around \u00a330m, a world record for a defender. Internazionale and Real Madrid are also interested in the centre-back, who will be 26 next week. Juventus recently bought the midfielder Pavel Nedved and the striker Marcelo Salas from Lazio. Despite the close relations between the clubs, the proposed Nesta deal has run into difficulty after reports that the Italian FA is investigating a possible conflict of interest: Nesta is represented by Alessandro Moggi, son of the Juventus director Luciano Moggi. A sale to United would have the advantage of not strengthening an Italian rival. And the English and Italian clubs have also developed a close relationship after the transfers of Jaap Stam to Lazio and Juan Sebastian Veron to Old Trafford. The Corriere della Sera yesterday warned Lazio's chairman Sergio Cragnotti against selling the player who has been Lazio captain and the heart of defence for both club and country. \"Would Roma ever sell [Francesco] Totti to Juve or Inter?\" the paper asked. And it urged Cragnotti to think again. \"If you, and not Lazio, have come to the end of the line then get off the bus and let someone else on.\" A Lazio spokeswoman yesterday declined to comment on Ferguson's visit. \"I read it in the papers, like you,\" said Laura Zaccheo. And on a possible transfer of Nesta: \"Only the chairman can say.\" David Beckham is set to sign a new four-year contract at \u00a390,000 a week that will effectively keep England's captain, 27 in May, with United until the end of his career. He is expected to formalise the \u00a318m deal this week. Beckham has finally agreed the deal, which will make him on of the world's highest-paid players, after months of negotiations that appeared at one stage to have broken down over image rights. This hurdle now appears to have been cleared and he will follow the captain Roy Keane, who signed a contract last week, in committing himself further to the club. The war of words between Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger continues unabated as the two main title rivals enter the championship's final straight. United's manager denied suggestions by his Arsenal counterpart that he is too big to accept any mistakes and described the Frenchman as a loner who should observe the English practice of having a post-match drink with the opposing manager. \"It would be good for him to accept the tradition,\" said Ferguson. \"It would allow him to relax after matches.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
