Ferguson believes Messi's coming together with Cristiano Ronaldo could be the centrepiece of Wednesday's game but the Manchester United manager is encouraged by the manner in which Patrice Evra played against Barcelona's talismanic attacker in last season's semi-final. \"We had to depend on the form of Patrice Evra and we're going to depend on that again,\" said Ferguson. \"Patrice is a fantastic footballer, so quick across the ground, and you need that against Messi because he's so quick himself. \"There were occasions at Old Trafford when there was just nothing we could do when he got the ball and attacked our players. You have to give him credit because he's so good there were moments when we were just hoping for a bit of luck, that he would make a bad pass, fall over the ball \u2013 anything.\" Barcelona will undoubtedly view Ronaldo with the same trepidation and after a week in which it became clear that Florentino P\u00e9rez, Real Madrid's president elect, had increased misgivings about the problems and costs associated with trying to extract him from Old Trafford, the world player of the year has insisted he is happy in Manchester and will no longer be pushing for a transfer. \"My heart is here,\" said Ronaldo. \"This is my home now. I think even when I say my heart is here, people are still going to speak and make things up. But this is where I want to play. \"We are part of an era that can go down in history for the way we are playing and for the trophies we are winning. The boss believes in this team and so do I. And this is where I want to be. Manchester United is now my house.\" Ronaldo attributed the change of heart to Ferguson's paternal stewardship and made a point of recognising the part the manager had played in his career. \"Ever since I joined United the manager has been like a father. No matter how good I become, I know he is a man who will always be able to teach me that little bit more. I don't just respect him, I have the affection for him a child has for his father.\" Ronaldo's importance to the team can be gauged by his goals in the competition so far and Ferguson believes the Portuguese currently has the edge over the most credible challenge to his title as the best footballer in the world.\"They are both great footballers. Ronaldo is stronger and older but now Messi has started to develop himself physically, his upper body is much stronger,\" said Ferguson. \"When Ronaldo was 18 he already had that fantastic profile as a footballer and an athlete, and that's one of the main differences. But they are both fantastic players who can create and score goals. When great players get to that level, it's all about the small details and it might just be that one of them could have an off night.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
