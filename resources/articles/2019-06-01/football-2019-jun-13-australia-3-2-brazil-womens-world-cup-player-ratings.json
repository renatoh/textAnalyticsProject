Brave. Nothing she could have done about the penalty or header from close range. 7 Ellie Carpenter Strong again. Looked to be exposed by Marta\u2019s skill, but had the pace to recover. Paired well with Gielnik on the right flank. 7 Elise Kellond-Knight Confident early and found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time, conceding a penalty for Brazil\u2019s first goal with a quick tug of Santos\u2019 shirt. Creative throughout and added fluency to Australia\u2019s play. 8 Alanna Kennedy No mucking about, with early clearances and a confident showing. 7 Steph Catley Playing in the centre of defence after Polkinghorne was forced to rest, Catley looked confident, but was caught flat footed on Christiane\u2019s headed goal, and lucky not to concede a penalty in the dying moments. 7 Tameka Yallop Strong game from Yallop, finding space in the midfield and showing confidence on the ball. 7 Emily van Egmond Stronger game, quick touches and benefited from the extra space provided by Brazil as they sat back in the first-half. 7 Chloe Logarzo Covered plenty of territory skirting Brazil\u2019s compact defence. She teed up Caitlin Foord for Australia\u2019s first goal, and earned the equaliser with her positive play. 8 Emily Gielnik An imposing figure in attack. Brazilian defenders hung off Gielnik, giving her space with some good opportunities to feed her center-forwards but she wasn\u2019t able to take advantage of her one clean shot in the first half which was easily picked up by Barbara. 7 Caitlin Foord Came here to play with quick footwork and she ran at players early. Lost possession too easily through the first 20 minutes, but kept positive, and her timely goal before half-time lifted Australia\u2019s spirits and dampened Brazil\u2019s heading into the changerooms. 7 Sam Kerr Dangerous in the forward line. While she didn\u2019t get her name on the scoresheet, she was pivotal in two of Australia\u2019s goals, and contributed plenty in defence. Just her presence seemed to put the Brazilian defence in two minds. 7 Subs: Hayley Raso (for Gielnik 71) 7; Karly Roestbakken (for Foord 94) 7 Brazil Barbara Strong and confident in the air from the first touch and just as strong down low with a nice save from Kerr at the near post. Scoreline doesn\u2019t reflect her control on the game. 8 Let\u00edcia Santos Good early pressure on Foord forced a turnover and sparked Brazil\u2019s attack. Her charging run into the box brought about a penalty and the first goal for Brazil. 7 Kathellen A quiet achiever in a star-studded team. Did well marking Kerr and forcing the Australian attack out wide. 6 M\u00f4nica Solid and dependable in defence, just as you want your centre-back to be. Unlucky to have scored the contentious own goal. 6 Tamires The queen of nutmegs. Tamires made numerous attacking overlapping plays from left-back that stretched the defence and led to Brazil\u2019s second goal. Importantly, she was strong tracking back in defence. 9 Andressa Alves A quiet performance with some flashes of brilliance early on, including a dangerous cross that just evaded her teammate Debinha. 6 Formiga Showed her experience in conserving energy in the middle of the park, but still got to where she needed to be to direct the attack. 6 Thaisa Very busy in the middle of the field but unable to impact the game. 5 Debinha Dangerous on turnovers with super quick attacking play and was able to get in behind Australia\u2019s defence. Put the cross into Cristiane for Brazil\u2019s second goal. 8 Cristiane Masterful at controlling the ball and pushing on in attack. She positioned herself well to get in front of Catley to score a strong header for Brazil\u2019s second goal. 7 Marta Amazing foot speed and technique to get around Geilnik on her first touch of the game. Marta still has the wiles and ball control to give the defence nightmares. Perfectly taken penalty to give Brazil an early lead. 7 Subs: Luana (For Formiga HT) 5; Ludmila (for Marta HT) 6; Beatriz (for Cristiane 75\u2019) 5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
