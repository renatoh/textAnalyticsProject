Ministers believe the cash, which will be spread over the next two years, will allow organisations such as Citizens Advice and Advice UK to recruit and train hundreds of new debt advisers. But critics argued the government was letting the financial services industry off the hook by attempting to solve the problem with taxpayers' money. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said banks and credit card companies should be asked to match cash taken from the financial inclusion fund. \"The finance industry will benefit greatly from increased confidence among consumers. If only for that reason it should be asked to play its part,\" he said. Consumer minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the fund would be targeted at areas in England and Wales with high levels of financial exclusion and at \"disadvantaged social groups\". He said: \"I know the misery that debt can bring from my own mail bag as consumer minister. There is some first-rate debt advice available, but debt remains a problem for many people. This money will lead to more advice to help people find a way out of the debilitating problems that debt can cause.\" The move was welcomed by debt advice organisations, which said they would be in a position to increase capacity should they win a slice of the fund. Teresa Perchard, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: \"This is a great initiative. It means we can really increase the number of debt advisers in the Citizens Advice service, and will be a lifeline to those most in need of help.\" Chief executive of Advice UK, Steve Johnson, said: \"This is great news for our members and will allow them to increase their capacity to give debt advice to the public.\" Mr Sutcliffe said the initiative was allied to measures in the consumer credit bill which began its passage through parliament last week. The bill aims to give consumers greater protection in many areas, including the provision of loans. The Department of Trade &amp; Industry will invite bids from debt advice charities and voluntary organisations for the money from the autumn, with priority given to those groups that already provide debt advice services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
