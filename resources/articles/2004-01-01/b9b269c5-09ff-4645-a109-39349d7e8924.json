England will instead play Japan and another leading European nation, yet to be confirmed, in a Tri-Nations tournament at the City of Manchester stadium as the final part of the build-up to this summer's European Championship. Talks are under way about another team from Euro 2004 making up the mini-tournament but Sven-Goran Eriksson did not want to involve France because England will face them in their opening group match in Lisbon on June 13. The games will take place in the first week of June and it will be the first time the club have staged an England international since 1949. The FA's decision highlights how highly the City of Manchester stadium is regarded. Each game should be a 48,000 sell-out. Kevin Phillips, the Southampton striker, is set to continue his spat with the Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann by sending the FA more film of their clash, along with his appeal for a personal hearing. The pair have been charged with misconduct after the German threw the ball at the back of Phillips's head at St Mary's on December 29. Phillips appeared to stand on the goalkeeper's foot and was accused afterwards of trying to provoke Lehmann. Marcel Desailly, the France captain, will retire next year when his contract at Chelsea expires. Desailly, who was born in Ghana, said he would like to be involved with the African side after he retires. \"I'm planning to help the national team, not as a coach but as a general manager. It would be a nice challenge,\" he told the French daily Le Monde. The referee Pierluigi Collina has announced that Euro 2004 will be his last major international tournament. The Association of Italian Referees says its referees cannot officiate professional matches beyond the age of 45. Collina is 44. Hartlepool's Marco Gabbiadini, 36, has brought his 18-year career to an end on med- ical advice over a knee injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
