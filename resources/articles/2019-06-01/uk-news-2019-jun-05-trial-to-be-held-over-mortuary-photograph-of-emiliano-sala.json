Sherry Bray, 48, of Corsham, has been summonsed for three counts of computer misuse, perverting the course of justice and sending an indecent/offensive message. Christopher Ashford, 62, of Calne, has been summonsed in relation to six counts of computer misuse. Both are due before Swindon magistrates court on 10 July, Wiltshire police said. Sala, from Argentina, who had just signed for Cardiff City, disappeared along with David Ibbotson, the pilot of the Piper Malibu, after the aircraft crashed in waters north of Guernsey on 21 January on a flight from France to the Welsh capital. Sala\u2019s body was found in the wreckage two weeks later, but Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, has not been found. In April, police began an investigation into how photographs of the body of Sala at Bournemouth public mortuary were circulated on Twitter before being quickly removed. Anthony Johns, senior lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cFollowing a careful review of the evidence provided to me by Wiltshire police, I have authorised the police to summons Sherry Bray to appear in court where she will be formally charged with three offences of computer misuse, perverting the course of public justice and sending an indecent/offensive message. \u201cI have also authorised Wiltshire police to summons Christopher Ashford to appear in court where he will be formally charged with six offences of computer misuse. \u201cThe Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendants are now active and that they have the right to a fair trial. \u201cIt is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
