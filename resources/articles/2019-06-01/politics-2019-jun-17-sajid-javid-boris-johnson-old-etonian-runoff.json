Javid, who is the son of a Pakistani bus driver, said he thought the contender to face Johnson should not be another Oxford University graduate or Old Etonian, but someone \u201cwith genuine experience of life\u201d. All the other candidates in the contest \u2013 Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Rory Stewart and Dominic Raab \u2013 went to Oxford, and all of them have attended private school, although Gove won a scholarship from a modest background and Raab attended a private primary school before attending a grammar school. In contrast, Javid, the home secretary, grew up in a working-class family in Bristol, going to a comprehensive school and then further education college, before going later to Exeter University. He tried to apply to enter banking in the City but was turned away and eventually was taken on by an American firm, which launched him into a high-flying financial career. Asked about whether he was confident he would make the final two, Javid said: \u201cBoris will be one of the final two. The question is who should be the other person alongside Boris \u2026 There is a growing feeling in the party that when we get to the final two we should have a robust debate between two credible change candidates. We need change \u2026 People don\u2019t want to see a final that\u2019s some kind of Oxford Union debate.\u201d In a critique of racial discrimination in the job market, he said the reason he had got into banking was \u201cbecause for a young Asian like me, most Asians, they go into jobs that you need to take an exam for, like chartered accountant, dentist\u201d. He said this was not because their parents valued those professions more highly but because \u201cdiscrimination is so inevitable in professions where you don\u2019t have to take exams\u201d. The home secretary was then challenged as to why MPs would vote for him as a change candidate when Stewart \u2013 another Old Etonian \u2013 had been gaining momentum with his fresh approach. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to top schools or go to debating society at Oxford \u2026 I am trying my best to communicate in the best way that I can \u2026 I might not be the most confident debater, or the most confident speaker. But I think what people want to see is someone who is genuine, who is honest, who has answers and experience of life, real life, life in business,\u201d he told a hustings event for political journalists in Westminster. He also criticised Stewart for trying too hard to appeal to Labour voters. Stewart\u2019s odds with the bookies have shortened since he launched his campaign with a series of walks and shaky handheld videos of himself talking to members of the public. At the hustings, he laid into Johnson for seemingly telling MPs different things in order to win their support. The frontrunner failed to appear at the hustings or the Channel 4 debate on Sunday night. \u201cSomehow he\u2019s convinced Matt Hancock that he agrees with every word that Matt says, that he\u2019s in favour of the softest of soft Brexits, he\u2019s convinced Robert Buckland that he would never go for a no-deal and at the same time he\u2019s got Mark Francois roaring: \u2018This man looked me in the eyes and promised we\u2019re going out on the hardest of no-deal Brexits,\u2019\u201d he said. Stewart insisted he was the best candidate to face Johnson in a runoff, even though he is not certain to get the 33 MPs necessary to stay in the race. He also refused to say whether he would vote leave or remain in another EU referendum, which is unlikely to impress the heavily Eurosceptic Tory membership who will pick the eventual winner. Raab, the former Brexit secretary, in his hustings slot, described the event as an \u201cessential gauntlet\u201d. That appeared to be a dig at Johnson\u2019s non-appearance. Hunt also undermined Johnson, saying his approach as foreign secretary to the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case had been a \u201cmistake\u201d, and Gove, the environment secretary, pointed out that any comparisons between Johnson and Hamlet should remember that the Shakespearean protagonist does not become king at the end of the play. Johnson declined to appear before journalists, but chose to use his column in the Daily Telegraph, for which he is paid, to announce plans to extend full-fibre broadband to every home in the country within five years, nine years ahead of the government\u2019s 2033 target."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
