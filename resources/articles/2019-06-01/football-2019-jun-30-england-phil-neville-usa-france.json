The Football Association may have been unamused by the reconnaissance mission involving the US checking out the luxury Fourvi\u00e8re hotel with a view to moving in before the World Cup final but England\u2019s manager succeeded in cloaking his firm disapproval in light-hearted disdain. After initially laughing it off, Neville said the whole manoeuvre was extremely \u201cun-British\u201d, a breach of etiquette and an event he would never have countenanced. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I would allow our organisation to do,\u201d he stated. Neville then declared that the French had fallen in love with his England team and would be supporting them in force here in Lyon during Tuesday night\u2019s semi-final. \u201cWe\u2019re the French second team now,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that their team are out they\u2019re supporting us, so we\u2019ll have the crowd on our side. The French people have got behind the story of our football. We are the team the French public want to win. The French support has been incredible.\u201d That statement was prompted by a question about whether the biggest game of his fledgling managerial career \u2013 and a potential watershed for the growth of women\u2019s football in England \u2013 might tempt him to compromise on his pass-and-move philosophy. After all, the former US goalkeeper Hope Solo had told Observer readers that the way to beat her old team is to go direct. \u201cNo, my style\u2019s non-negotiable, I\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m a bit stubborn,\u201d said England\u2019s manager with a smile as he reiterated one of his favourite phrases. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change our style. We believe it\u2019s the best way to get success. The USA is the best team in the world, without a shadow of a doubt. Their record and their coach\u2019s record are phenomenal. But never worry about the opposition. I want to concentrate on us. Our strengths, our values, our style of play. The way we want to play is the most important thing. Our aim is to go out and play a World Cup semi-final with the freedom, expression and smiles. I want us to keep the ball and keep it moving.\u201d Neville proved similarly sure-footed when the conversation turned to Megan Rapinoe, the US\u2019s spiky social justice advocate and arch critic of Donald Trump who scored twice against France in her side\u2019s 2-1 quarter-final win and is now preparing to challenge England\u2019s imperious right-sided pairing of Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris. \u201cI admire people that have personality and character, who have strong values and stand up for what they believe in,\u201d said Neville. \u201cI admire her fight for equality and diversity. Yes, I admire Megan Rapinoe. Me personally, I\u2019d never get involved in any political issue. From my point of view, sometimes it\u2019s better to stay in your lane. I don\u2019t like it when politicians get involved in football. But we do have a platform to influence people.\u201d When he was asked about the match-up between Bronze and Rapinoe he recalled how well England\u2019s versatile Rachel Daly had played at right-back when England drew with the US in March. \u201cI do believe Lucy\u2019s the best player in the world. She\u2019s unique in almost everything she does,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Lucy can step into midfield so I\u2019ve got a big decision to make. It might be Rachel Daly at right-back. She did really well against Rapinoe [in the SheBelieves Cup]. Rachel was amazing.\u201d England\u2019s coach also remembered when he went to gather a loose ball on the touchline that day. \u201cRapinoe went to catch the ball and her studs went right through my Apple watch,\u201d said Neville. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say sorry. She\u2019s a real competitor.\u201d He believes his players have developed a similar mindset. \u201cElite sport is about winning,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one cares about the silver or the bronze medal. My players now want to win the World Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
