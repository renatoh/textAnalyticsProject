In football, English optimism is never so high as when the national team have just qualified for a major tournament, the more so after Wednesday night's strut and swagger past Croatia to next summer's World Cup. In eight months England will set off for South Africa with everybody waving the cross of St George and singing Goodbye, Dolly Gray, although by then the odd doubt may have set in depending on the state of Wayne Rooney's metatarsals and Steven Gerrard's groin. It was ever thus. On this occasion England have made it with two games to spare, and only an incurable pessimist would suggest that this leaves a bit more time for things to go wrong. All the same, it is a pity that the World Cup is not starting next week, for then the drastic slashing of the odds against England winning the thing, which followed Wednesday's 5-1 victory, would make more sense. As it is the punters are once more putting their money where their brains ought to be. Even Fabio Capello might not be prepared to make it much more than an each-way bet. All that can be safely said is that England's present coach has reached a comfort zone that compares favourably with most of his predecessors. Glenn Hoddle's and Sven-Goran Eriksson's teams qualified competently with the odd touch of style, but Capello's England have made it with an assurance rarely seen in the national side. The transformation from Steve McClaren's myopic muddlers to a team in which every player knows his part and remembers his lines has been remarkable. It would be as well, though, to keep a sense of perspective. Qualifying amid a deluge of goals means nothing in terms of what may happen in South Africa. England could have scraped through on Wednesday with the sort of hometown penalty they were comically awarded against Slovenia four days earlier and the situation would be the same. The strength of the performance will keep English hopes warm for the winter but everybody \u2013 Capello, his players, the media and the fans \u2013 knows that World Cups proper make their own rules when it comes to success or failure. Capello's biggest feat to date has been to restore confidence to a team that previously punched well below its weight. After Eriksson and McClaren, England needed an organiser and a disciplinarian, someone who would flirt with neither femmes fatales nor fake sheikhs and who would leave his umbrella at home. One screw-up on the veldt could change everything, but at least England should avoid Italy when the draw is made in Cape Town towards the end of the year. People say curious things before big matches, and Slaven Bilic, the Croatia coach, made himself fortune's hostage when he said the opposition had lost some of their Englishness, \"some of the things that have always made England teams difficult to defend against and play against\". Bilic was probably trying to gee up his own players after a poor performance against Belarus, and he backtracked before kick\u2011off. Either way, Capello's team seemed to go out of their way to treat Croatia to a traditional fish and chip supper, with three of the goals coming from crosses and headers. In each instance it was the quality of the cross and the header which counted as much as its ethnicity. England have tended to do better in World Cups when their Englishness is complemented by something a bit different from the norm. In the build-up to the 1966 tournament, Alf Ramsey was derided for abandoning orthodox, stand-and-deliver wing play and switching Bobby Charlton to a central role behind the frontrunners. But it worked. In 1990, after a tedious draw with the Republic of Ireland in the opening match, Bobby Robson astounded everyone by switching to a sweeper system. Again, it worked. Capello already knows how he wants to play, and more importantly so do his players. Scoring nine times against Croatia, England's nemesis when McClaren's side failed to qualify for Euro 2008, has been a healthy start, yet it should not be forgotten that but for Bilic and his earlier team, the Italian might never have been appointed. And the only England squad going to South Africa in the near future would be the one carrying bats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
