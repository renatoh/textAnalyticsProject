Stories came a decade into a career in which she\u2019d swung between blues rock, gothic balladry and the anarchic spirit of punk, dressed up in her gorgeously deep, occasionally West Country-tinged, Americanised vocals. It was also a much more direct, immediate proposition of who she was, turning up the colour on her extraordinary palette of styles and emotions. Stories is also one of the best albums ever made about the madness and intensity of new love. It is cinematic and high octane throughout. Big Exit begins proceedings like a lusty, full-throttle Bonnie and Clyde homage, Harvey\u2019s character feeling immortal with her lover and desperate for a gun. Good Fortune is more tender, speaking of the erotic surrender that arrives when you\u2019re falling for someone. Bad luck gets thrown off tall buildings. Little Italy and Chinatown glow behind love-fuelled hangovers. Harvey\u2019s protagonist becomes a bird of paradise. The lovely production takes us there with her, our hearts full in our mouths. It\u2019s also a record where a woman is articulating her sexual hunger without apology. We\u2019re given characters on rooftops, in bed, on the bed, telling us how immediate these feelings feel. The first line of This Is Love sums it all up: \u201cI can\u2019t believe life\u2019s so complex / When I just want to sit here and watch you undress.\u201d The three albums to check out next To Bring You My Love (1995) The artwork for Harvey\u2019s breakthrough album says a lot about its sound. Here\u2019s a pre-Raphaelite Ophelia in the lake, but rail-thin, and in heavy drag: Harvey\u2019s creating classic art, essentially, but giving it a fierce, distressing twist. For this album, Harvey was without Steve Vaughan and Rob Ellis, her original band, for the first time, and wrote these songs in the remote countryside. Her new solo personality rages from even its softest corners. The echo of Patti Smith\u2019s raw poetry mixes with ragged blues, and folk\u2019s obsession with lost sons and daughters rubs against earworm melodies. C\u2019mon Billy and Down By the Water were played heavily on Radio 1\u2019s evening schedule at the time, and remain hard to shift from the mind. 4-Track Demos (1993) Stripped down to bare, brittle bones, Harvey\u2019s early talent crackles and burns. This isn\u2019t exactly Polly Jean\u2019s Nebraska, but evokes dusty plains in a similar way, even if those plains are being prowled by a vengeful, ferocious woman in her early 20s. Rid of Me, in particular, sounds startling here, a terrifying expression of a woman not accepting the departure of her lover (\u201cI\u2019ll tie your legs / Keep you against my chest\u201d), while Yuri-G shows another desperate to leave heartbreak behind for outer space. And god bless 50ft Queenie, gentler here than on Rid of Me, but no less menacing: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my name: F-U-C-K\u201d. White Chalk (2007) 2011\u2019s Let England Shake might have grabbed all the plaudits (and a second Mercury prize after Stories from the City), but it also marked the moment Harvey stopped creating distinct, artistic inner worlds and turned to politics, often with less interesting results (The Hope Six Demolition Project feels a little simplistic and patronising four years on). This overlooked album sees Harvey learning piano for the first time, her singing high, strange and eerie, resulting in her saddest, most despairing collections of songs. When Under Ether suggests a female, gnarly twist on TS Eliot\u2019s Prufrock (\u201cWhen under ether / The mind comes alive\u201d). Broken Harp, featuring the instrument in question, is its bleak flipside (\u201cPlease don\u2019t reproach me for how empty my life has become\u201d). The Piano\u2019s lyrics could be straight off Dry, but its delivery is delicate, desperately mournful and, crucially, new. It\u2019s Joy Division\u2019s Closer in Emily Dickinson\u2019s clothes; a Northern soul compilation straight after to cheer things up might be a good idea. One for the heads Who Will Love Me Now? (B-side to That Was My Veil, John Parish and PJ Harvey, 1996) Written by film and TV composer Nick Bic\u00e2t, this plays like a lost theme from an eerie 1970s children\u2019s drama, its lyrics rolling out like an exquisite, macabre fairytale. John Parish\u2019s guitar plays a sweet melody against vaguely trip-hoppy stuttering rhythms, then Harvey enters full angelic mode. \u201cIn the forest is a monster / It has done terrible things,\u201d she sings, beautifully and sadly, before it\u2019s revealed who the monster really is.

Further reading PJ Harvey: \u201cI feel things deeply. I get angry, I shout at the TV, I feel sick\u201d, by Dorian Lynskey, the Observer (2011) A fantastic profile of Harvey from the time of Let England Shake, which digs deeply into her personality, presentation and politics, and how her art school approach has shaped her career. Crack Actor: PJ Harvey\u2019s To Bring You My Love at 25, by Ben Hewitt, the Quietus (2020) A glorious, thorough dig into each track, assessing Harvey as an actor as much as a musician and comparing her with Marlon Brando: \u201cAn actor with intense, chameleonic charisma, as tough, scary, heartbreaking or unnerving as each role demands, bringing the record\u2019s desperate souls to life with her full-blooded, full-bodied portrayals.\u201d PJ Harvey\u2019s Rid Of Me: A Story, by Kate Schatz (2007) A deeply peculiar but fittingly twisted response to Harvey\u2019s second album, from the experimental 33 1/3 series of album reappraisals. This is a particularly off-beam approach: a novel in which two young women find themselves together in a house in a forest that borders their hometown, fighting forces that oppress them from both their present and the past. The 14 chapters follow the track listing, and sex, revenge and love feature highly. Anything to keep them entertained in self-isolation. \u2022 What\u2019s your favourite PJ Harvey album or song?
