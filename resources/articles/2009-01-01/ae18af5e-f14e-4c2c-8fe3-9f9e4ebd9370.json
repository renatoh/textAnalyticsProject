Yahoo's president Sue Decker will resign after a \"transitional period\". It remains to be seen how many other people will follow\u2026. The announcement was widely expected (as we reported), but we should give a hat-tip to Kara Swisher at Boom Town on All Things D, who was first to float the idea last Wednesday in a story: New Prospect for Yahoo CEO: Carol Bartz (and no, she hasn't let us forget that). But the key question is what happens next, and as Swisher says: Is a Microsoft Search Deal With Yahoo \"Ticked and Tied\"? Apparently Microsoft is ready. Swisher says: BoomTown could not get further details of the proposal, but it is likely to be similar to past ones Microsoft has offered, with a small payment upfront and a long-term and large amount of guaranteed revenue. Yahoo seems to have had trouble finding someone to grasp the poisoned chalice, but Bartz is already 60. She could parcel Yahoo into saleable bits and get some of the shareholders their money back, or even turn the business around -- not a safe bet given the state of the world. But if it all goes wrong, she's not going to ruin a bright career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
