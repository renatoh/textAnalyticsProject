Here's the full picture", "bodyText": "In 2018 the price of a UK cinema ticket fell for the first time in 17 years, to an average of \u00a37.22. But, as Phil Clapp of trade body the UK Cinema Association points out, some Londoners would probably be shocked to learn there are people paying as little as that, while in other parts of the country there are film fans who would be \u201coutraged\u201d at the idea of paying that much. Regional variation in pricing has always existed but, let\u2019s face it, a cinema charging \u00a34 in Aberdeen is not much use if you live in Brighton. However, the news now is that tickets are getting cheaper \u2026 and also more expensive. If that sounds like a contradiction, it is because, as Clapp says, the market is becoming more fragmented. \u00a340 tickets and waiter service We are seeing a boom in so-called boutique cinemas. Within the space of just 12 months, the Everyman chain opened venues in five new locations. Everyman and others like it claim to offer a more luxurious experience, with sofas and armchairs, beautifully designed interiors, a cocktail menu and, in some cases, waiter service to your seat \u2013 with ticket prices to match. Even the multiplexes are tapping into this high-end market: the Odeon has spacious reclining seats in its Luxe cinemas. If you want to see X-Men: Dark Phoenix at London\u2019s Odeon Leicester Square on Saturday night, the priciest reclining seat will set you back an eye-watering \u00a340.75, which is more than some people will be paying for their seat on a low-cost flight to Europe this summer (though it\u2019s fair to say that a spot in one of the back rows will \u201conly\u201d set you back \u00a310.75). Prices slashed In such a buoyant market, the traditional multiplexes are having to do more to attract customers. Both Cineworld and Odeon now offer unlimited monthly memberships where you can watch as many films as you like. But it is the Vue cinema chain that has arguably had the most dramatic price change. In 2018 Vue slashed its ticket prices by more than 50% in some places. There are currently about 40 Vue cinemas that charge an \u201cevery film every day\u201d price of \u00a34.99. This typically applies to a 2D film in a standard seat and excludes booking fees. And in Cardiff, Vue charges just \u00a34 (in fact, Wales is one of the cheapest places to go to the cinema in the UK). Other Vue cinemas charge more than double that, and several times more in central London. Such strategic pricing upset some customers when it was introduced, prompting complaints that it was unfair to be charged more than neighbouring cities and towns. Cinemas make money through a mix of ticket sales, food and drink, advertising and, in some cases, public funds. By pitching its prices so low, Vue no doubt hopes to get more bums on seats \u2013 or, as Patrick von Sychowski, editor of Celluloid Junkie, puts it, \u201cbums on seats with popcorn and Coke\u201d. Making cinema affordable For cinemas such as the Cube in Bristol, however, pricing is not so much a business as an ethical decision. This single-screen arthouse cinema \u2013 set up in 1998 by a group of artists and film-makers \u2013 is run entirely by volunteers. Chiz Williams, who has been volunteering there since 1999, says that when deciding what to charge, they ask, \u201cWhat would we pay?\u201d and land on a price that \u201cemotionally feels right\u201d. The cinema currently charges \u00a35 full price and \u00a34 concessions for most screenings. They also have \u201ccheap\u201d nights where you pay less. Even a cup of tea is an impressively reasonable 50p. When I asked Williams if people needed to provide proof for the concession rate, he says no, and that \u201cgenerally it\u2019s done on trust\u201d. Although there are the occasional chancers: \u201cI turned away someone who said he wanted to come in cheaper because he was an actor. He looked at me and smiled and then paid full price.\u201d What\u2019s perhaps surprising is that it is not just non-profits or the multiplexes \u2013 with their economies of scale \u2013 that can afford to be cheap. The for-profit Picturedrome, a small independent chain predominantly in the south of England and Wales, has some of the lowest ticket prices in the country: at the majority of its cinemas, tickets cost between \u00a33.50 and \u00a34.50. The chain\u2019s managing director, Adam Cunard, took over the then-struggling Bognor Regis Picturedrome in 2007. \u201cIt was very sad. There were five people in some days,\u201d he recalls. After bringing the Grade II-listed building back to life, Cunard expanded to other rural and seaside towns such as Westgate-on-Sea in Kent and Clacton in Essex \u2013 in some cases reviving cinemas that had been closed for decades. Attracting people who had previously written off going to the cinema as unaffordable is just one part of his strategy. By offering cheaper tickets, Cunard and others aim to turn cinema-going into a regular habit rather than an occasional treat. After all, people are more likely to take a punt on a film if it only costs them a few pounds. And it is a strategy that seems to be working. \u201cWe have people coming to the cinema week in, week out,\u201d says Cunard. \u00a31 tickets and free screenings Many of the independents seem to have a genuine desire to make cinema accessible to all \u2013 particularly for those who would find even \u00a33.50 unaffordable. For example, the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle upon Tyne offers \u00a31 daytime tickets to the unemployed, refugees and asylum seekers. And at both the Cube and Hebden Bridge Picture House in West Yorkshire, asylum seekers and refugees get in for free. However, with many people housed in nearby Halifax rather than Hebden Bridge itself, the Friends of the Picture House also secured charitable funding so they could run monthly group cinema trips with transport, and sometimes lunch, provided. As an aside, Hebden Bridge Picture House also runs its young person\u2019s concession rate up to the age of 25, in recognition of the fact that many people are still finding their feet financially in their early 20s. The desire to widen access was partly what motivated Neil Johns when he co-founded the Peckham and Nunhead Free Film Festival in 2010 (this year\u2019s takes place between 5 and 15 September). \u201cWe wanted to make everything free so that there were no barriers to people coming along,\u201d he says. Since then, there have been free film festivals in other London boroughs and locations including Glasgow, Weston-super-Mare and Guildford. Run solely by local volunteers, the festivals put on free screenings, often in atypical venues such as cemeteries, parks and abandoned buildings. Shared experiences I went to a screening of acclaimed Australian horror film The Babadook at Canopy Beer, a craft brewery and tap room in Herne Hill, south London. About 30 people sat on wooden benches and there was a distinctly beery smell. If you had gone there for comfort and luxury, you would be sorely disappointed, but that would also be to miss the point. It was the kind of environment where you could easily strike up a conversation with your neighbour. As Johns says: \u201cIt\u2019s about that shared experience of people coming together and meeting people they might not have seen otherwise.\u201d And besides, the occasional rumble of an overhead train was a fitting addition to a film described by the Observer\u2019s Mark Kermode as a \u201cnightmarish fairytale\u201d. I can\u2019t help thinking that such group experiences are more vital than ever. As Williams says: \u201cWe\u2019ve turned into a bunch of isolated people watching our phones for a couple of hours at night.\u201d Alternatively, we could \u201cgo to another space to enjoy something together, talk about it, look at each other and hear each other laugh\u201d. In April, Helen Mirren grabbed the headlines when she memorably declared: \u201cI love Netflix, but fuck Netflix,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is nothing like sitting in the cinema.\u201d With cinema attendance at its highest level for 48 years, there are clearly many people who feel the same way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
