The US$15m three-year coral reef airborne laboratory mission promises to solve outstanding mysteries of what drives coral reef health and provide reef managers with better information about how to protect them. Reefs around the world are still reeling from the worst global bleaching event in recorded history. On the Great Barrier Reef almost a quarter of the coral was lost, mainly in the remote northern sections. Using a Nasa plane decked-out with a cutting-edge image sensor, Eric Hochberg from the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and colleagues will examine how much of the area is covered by coral, sand and algae, then repeat the survey at three other locations around the world. The state-of-the-art image sensor, called the portable remote imaging spectrometer (Prism) was developed by Nasa\u2019s jet propulsion laboratory and is able to capture data across the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectrums, at a level of detail similar to what can be captured from a boat. From 8.5km above the water, the scientists will be able to see what is happening on reefs at a huge new scale, which would produce a \u201cstep change\u201d in how we understand the factors influencing the health of reefs, Hochberg told Guardian Australia. \u201cOur current surveys, even though we\u2019re doing our very best, it\u2019s easy to miss things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at a point here and a point there but what\u2019s in between? What we\u2019re after is to get the complete picture.\u201d Hochberg said pollution was known to hurt coral reefs but researchers had had trouble pinning down the connection. He said part of the impetus for the new survey came from an analysis he had done of reef health and human impacts, which could not find a clear link. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what convinced Nasa to support this project,\u201d he said. Hochberg said by studying vast sections of reefs at once the team would be able to compare a lot of different areas without missing sections. Part of the research has involved developing an algorithm that lets scientists using the image sensor see through the water as if it wasn\u2019t there. Tim Malthus from the CSIRO has been working on it for 10 years. \u201cIf you want to see the corals, the intervening water is an influence, and we\u2019ve been developing algorithms to remove the influence of that water,\u201d Malthus told Guardian Australia. The planes will fly through six regions of the reef, stretching from Heron Island near the southern end all the way to the Torres Strait. The team has already completed survey flights over Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii as a test and will fly over the Great Barrier Reef by the end of October. After that they will survey the main Hawaiian islands, Marianas islands and Palau. The biggest promise the work holds out is in its future applications on satellites, Hochberg said. A better way to understand reef health than a snapshot is to see how they change over time. Several groups plan to launch satellites with sensors that could produce this type of data. The Japanese space agency Jaxa is planning to launch HISUI in 2018 and the German Aerospace Laboratory is due to launch EnMap in 2019. Nasa is considering one called HyspIRI, which is still in the conceptual stage. According to Malthus, that will change the way coral reefs are studied. \u201cThis is really a precursor for the next generation of satellites that will be in space,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows us to prepare and explore new algorithms for when these types of sensors are routinely operated in space.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
