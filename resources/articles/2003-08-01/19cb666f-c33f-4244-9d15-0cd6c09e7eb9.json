The Spanish champions were due to see representatives of Chelsea on Monday to discuss a possible deal but have now cancelled the meeting. The 30-year-old has long resented the fact that he is one of the poorest paid first-team members at Real, earning a sixth of the wages paid to galacticos such as Zinedine Zidane or David Beckham. That resentment came to boiling point yesterday when it became clear he had a realistic alternative to his present employers - and one prepared to pay huge salaries. Jorge Valdano, Madrid's sporting director, is known to be incensed at the World Cup winner's action and has vowed that the only way he will be allowed to leave the club is if a buyer satisfies the release clause written into Makalele's contract. This is believed to value him at \u20ac100m (\u00a373.5m), unrealistic in today's market - particularly for a player of his age. Makalele is crucial to the Madrid side as he is one of their few defensively minded players and he shoulders a huge responsibility in holding the midfield together. As such he is also attractive to Claudio Ranieri, who would look to pair him with Juan Sebastian Veron in the middle of midfield. Chelsea were thought to be preparing a bid of around \u00a36m to try to prise the player from the Bernabeu. Jaime Ladjemi, Makalele's agent, said of Chelsea yesterday: \"Talks are ongoing. Claude would be interested in a move to England. He's experienced Spain but he wants to try England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
