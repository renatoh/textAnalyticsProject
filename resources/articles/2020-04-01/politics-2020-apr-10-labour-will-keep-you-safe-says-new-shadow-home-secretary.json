In an interview with the Guardian, the Welsh MP, promoted to the shadow cabinet in Keir Starmer\u2019s comprehensive reshuffle last weekend, said crime was a \u201cprogressive issue\u201d, and lavished praise on the police for enforcing the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cLabour have a message that we will keep you, your family and your community safe. That\u2019s very much the approach that I come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.\u201d \u201cResponsibility is the word that I would use,\u201d he said. \u201cResponsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it\u2019s the responsibility to keep people safe.\u201d He was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of over-zealousness. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened. But I just think it\u2019s unfair when I as a politician have handed over this enormous set of powers, to then start picking on particular officers and particular forces. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is to recognise the difficult situation, and the latitude we do need to give to our officers,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, I think the police are getting it right.\u201d With some of the best-known figures in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet relegated to the backbenches, either voluntarily or at Starmer\u2019s hand, Thomas-Symonds and his new shadow cabinet colleagues will be intently scrutinised for clues to Labour\u2019s direction. Like the party\u2019s new leader, he strikes a resolutely constructive tone regarding the government\u2019s handling of the virus. \u201cIn a public health emergency, a national crisis like this \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to think of anything comparable since 1945, frankly \u2013 my view is that we have to support the government in the aim of minimising loss of life through the crisis. That\u2019s absolutely in the national interest, and absolutely what we aim to do. But we have to balance it with scrutiny,\u201d he said. But Thomas-Symonds said he hoped the crucial frontline role played by NHS workers and others in the crisis, and the weekly nationwide round of applause, would help to change attitudes to migration. The government\u2019s new points-based system, due to come into force next year, is expected to set a salary threshold of \u00a325,600 \u2013 or more in some sectors \u2013 with the aim of halting low-skilled migration. \u201cOne thing I really hope this crisis has taught the Conservatives, is that the value of what people do is not always reflected in the salary that they\u2019re paid,\u201d Thomas-Symonds said. \u201cWe hear a lot of warm words about our police, the ambulance services, the fire services, our NHS workers, our care workers. But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that\u2019s being proposed, nurses, especially when they\u2019re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.\u201d He declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be \u201cfairer\u201d, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years. \u201cIn terms of migration and broad principles, Labour\u2019s an internationalist party. Labour will always believe in the right to live and to work in other countries. Of course we will; also in terms of fairness, and a recognition that the immigration system is about people. It\u2019s not about numbers, it\u2019s not about statistics, it\u2019s about people,\u201d he said, describing the Windrush scandal as a \u201cshameful\u201d episode. While little known outside Westminster, the 39-year-old has written two biographies of Labour\u2019s great figures \u2013 Aneurin Bevan and Clement Attlee \u2013 and practised as a barrister until becoming an MP in 2015. Before training as a lawyer, he taught politics at Oxford University. \u201cI\u2019ve studied the history of the home secretaries, and my impression is that the really successful home secretaries are strategic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a really strong sense of what their priorities are, and they give a very strong sense of direction, and when that disappears, I think that\u2019s when you start to get into trouble.\u201d He is surprised his Tory opposite number, Priti Patel, has not played a more prominent role during the crisis. Major decisions are being overseen by a \u201cquad\u201d of senior ministers, chaired in the prime minister\u2019s absence by the first secretary, Dominic Raab, and including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove. Asked about Patel\u2019s absence from the inner circle, Thomas-Symonds says: \u201cI do think the home secretary should be out on the media regularly, showing her support for our police officers. We want to say them very clearly as politicians, we back what you\u2019re doing and we understand the difficulties.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
