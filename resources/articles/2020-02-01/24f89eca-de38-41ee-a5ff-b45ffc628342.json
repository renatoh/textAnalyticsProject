A generation later, did Irish Americans play a role in Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s breakthrough in Ireland\u2019s general election? No. The party won 24.5% of the first-preference vote \u2013 almost doubling its share from 2016 \u2013 by harnessing voter anger at homelessness, soaring rents and fraying public services. The dream of a united Ireland that animates so many Irish Americans, and the Northern Ireland peace process once nurtured by Washington, took a backseat. The election revolved around bread-and-butter topics \u2013 the cost of living, insurance premiums, pension reform. Sinn F\u00e9in rode a wave of young voters seeking an alternative to the socio-economic status quo represented by Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, centrist rivals that have taken turns ruling Ireland for almost a century. For such voters Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s backing of the IRA during the Troubles was a long time ago in a land far away. But stepping back in history, Irish America did hinder, then help, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s electoral rise. In the 1970s and 80s, Noraid and other US-based republican front groups provided cash and encouragement to a brutal campaign that made Sinn F\u00e9in toxic to Irish voters. In the 1990s the so-called four horsemen of Irish American political influence, Edward Kennedy, Tip O\u2019Neill, Daniel Moynihan and Hugh Carey, helped persuade Bill Clinton to back the peace process and grant the then Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams a US visa, paving the way for the 1994 IRA ceasefire and 1998 Good Friday agreement. This marked the start of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s gradual electoral ascent. So Irish America rehabilitated Gerry Adams? It certainly helped his transition, in the eyes of many Irish voters, from apologist for atrocity to peacemaker. Sinn Fein\u2019s vote share inched up from 2.6% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2002, 6.9% in 2007, 9.9% in 2011 and 13.8% in 2016. Adams was a savvy strategist but limited the party\u2019s expansion. He had a whiff of sulphur, a Belfast accent and patchy grasp of economics south of the border. His stepping down as leader in 2018, and as a TD (MP) in this election, distanced the shadowy past and let Sinn F\u00e9in, under Mary Lou McDonald, an affable Dubliner, pitch a message of change and economic justice that could have been scripted by Bernie Sanders. Will McDonald be the darling of the St Patrick\u2019s day parade in New York next month? Tricky. She caused a stink last year after marching behind a banner reading \u201cEngland Get Out Of Ireland\u201d. The Irish government and unionists branded it offensive, divisive and an embarrassment. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s support tumbled and McDonald sort-of-apologised. Should Irish Americans start a countdown to a united Ireland? Premature. Sinn F\u00e9in wants a referendum on unity within five years. But in Northern Ireland that decision rests with the British secretary of state, who can call it only if a majority for unification appears likely. That prospect looks remote, notwithstanding Brexit. However, if Sinn F\u00e9in ends up in government in Dublin \u2013 after weeks, possibly months of coalition talks \u2013 it could use a citizens\u2019 assembly, policy papers and other ways to put the dream on the political agenda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
