Both pilots ejected after the collision, which took place at about 2pm on Monday over Lake Drewitz in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, about 175km (109 miles) north-west of Berlin. One of the pilots was found alive, hanging in a tree canopy. Public broadcaster NDR later reported the second pilot had died. Police confirmed only that they had discovered a body. The two planes crashed about 10km apart, one inside a forest and the other on a field at the edge of some woodland. According to Germany\u2019s air force, the pilots were part of a trio of Eurofighters flying a mission out of Laage, near Rostock. All three planes were part of the Tactical Air Force Wing 73 \u2013 known as Steinhoff \u2013 a fighter wing that specialises in general air defence and is the chief training centre for Eurofighter pilots in Germany. The pilot of the third Eurofighter witnessed the collision and said he had seen two parachutes ejecting from the planes. In a press statement, the Luftwaffe denied rumours that the two jets had been armed with explosives, but nonetheless told the public to stay away from the crash sites. Germany\u2019s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, and Lorenz Caffier, the interior minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, are expected to give a statement near the crash site later this afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
