The Gypsy King and the Bronze Bomber, Deontay Wilder, began their three-day, three-city, transatlantic tour in London\u2019s Olympic village on Monday to promote their 1 December world title fight. Both sides needed to strike an awkward balance, feisty enough to sell pay per view but respectful enough to let everyone know this was a real match\u2011up at the summit of the heavyweight division. Anthony Joshua\u2019s name was notable by its absence. In public Fury let rip at Wilder, calling him, among other things, an idiot, a dosser, a hollow shell and an easy touch. \u201cHe\u2019s a lemon and I\u2019m going to squeeze him nice and hard.\u201d Wilder was often talked over while his zingers had an oddly homely turn. \u201cI\u2019m about to put him in the oven and make a muffin,\u201d he said at one point. In the climax of the event Fury insisted he wanted to \u201cfeel the power\u201d of the infamous knock-out merchant and invited Wilder to take a shot. He duly stepped up and gave the Englishman half a shove. Frank Warren positioned himself beneath the pair and things calmed down after everyone had got their photo. The conclusion was that Fury had rattled Wilder in the first of no doubt many exchanges before the fight for the WBC crown in the Los Angeles Staples Centre. But away from the cameras there was a different impression. Wilder was relaxed, willing to talk at length about his career and his background as the child of clergy in rural Alabama. He was also keen to ponder what the absence of Pete Fury, uncle and long-time trainer, might have on his opponent. The lineal champion, meanwhile, was almost a different person. The bravado was gone and instead there were only encomiums of praise for his opponent. And while Fury claimed he was \u201cliving in Wilder\u2019s head\u201d at the moment, he also said it did not matter at all. \u201cThis is about us two expressing our feelings to one another and showing how much we love each other and how much this is big-time boxing,\u201d Fury said. \u201cAll the mind games don\u2019t really mean anything at all. Nothing. \u201cAnything that\u2019s happened in the past you can forget about it. Forget about all the fights I\u2019ve had, the 27 fights, they don\u2019t mean squat going in on the night. It\u2019s one man versus one man in one fight. \u201cAfter the fight I\u2019m not so interested in,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019m only focusing on this fight, being in that ring for 36 minutes and doing what I do best. Any man or woman can only do their best in life and, if it ain\u2019t good enough, there\u2019s no shame in losing to a better person. \u201cBut have the guts to try and follow that dream. And me personally, if I can\u2019t be the best, then I don\u2019t want to be the rest. I don\u2019t want to be anything else than the best. And that\u2019s all she wrote.\u201d The Wilder-Fury tour continues in the US until Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
