In an announcement that may bring millions around the world to tears, Jason Orange has revealed that he is leaving Take That. The group, which also included Robbie Williams when they burst into the charts in the early 1990s, said that they will go on despite being reduced to a trio. Orange, 44, told Mark Owen, Gary Barlow and Howard Donald last week that he did not want to commit to recording and promoting a new album. \u201cAt the start of this year and with my full knowledge and blessing the guys began writing new material,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been no fallings out, only a decision on my part that I no longer wish to do this ... They have my full support and encouragement to continue on with what is to be another chapter for the band.\u201d The three remaining members said in a statement on Wednesday night that Orange\u2019s departure was a huge loss both professionally and personally: \u201cWe first became aware of Jason\u2019s reservations a couple of years ago but had hoped that by giving him the desired time and space he may begin to feel differently. This has not been the case and we now have to accept and fully respect his decision.\u201d The one-time breakdancer, who was linked romantically with Lulu after she appeared on Take That\u2019s 1993 remake of Relight My Fire, thanked his bandmates \u201cwho I feel are like brothers to me\u201d, as well as the group\u2019s \u201cbeautiful and ever-loyal fans\u201d. The group has been one of the most successful in British pop history, with seven albums and 11 singles reaching number one in the UK. Take That was the One Direction of the early 90s, sparking the frenzied devotion of teenage girls, and became global stars in 1995 after the single Back for Good went to number one in 31 countries and made the US top ten. Williams left the group in acrimonious circumstances in 1995 and, after continuing as a four piece, Take That announced they were splitting up in February 1996. A greatest hits album released in late 2005 that sold more than two million copies and an ITV documentary put the group back on the map. The resulting comeback album, Beautiful World, underlined their enduring popularity by entering the chart at number one. The group\u2019s Progress stadium tour in 2011, which featured the return of Williams, was the most successful in UK and Irish history, selling a record 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. Take That have been in hiatus since the end of the tour, with Barlow appearing as a judge on The X Factor, although the group did perform at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Orange, along with Donald, did not attempt a solo career, unlike Williams, Barlow and Owen, who enjoyed minimal chart success. Recruited more for his ability as a dancer and good looks, he did not sing or play an instrument on the initial albums. After the group\u2019s first split, he took A-levels at South Trafford College, convinced that he would have to get used to life outside the pop stratosphere. However, the group\u2019s reunion delayed that prospect. Orange sang lead vocals on Wooden Boat, which became the final track on Beautiful World. Laying down his vocals in 2006 left him in tears in the studio, according to one report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
