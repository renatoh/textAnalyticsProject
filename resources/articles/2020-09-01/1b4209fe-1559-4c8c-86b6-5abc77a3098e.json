This weekend\u2019s British championships in Manchester were the last event to be staged by the BBC under a contract that has been worth more than \u00a32m a year to UKA. But with talks with the corporation at an impasse, Joanna Coates says next year\u2019s meetings in London and Gateshead are under threat. \u201cI would like to think we wouldn\u2019t lose the Diamond League in this country but we can\u2019t take the losses we have taken at some of our major events. I think we can fill the London Stadium, I think we can stretch out ticket prices. But broadcast revenue is a substantial amount of the income too. We are absolutely looking at our event portfolio and we have got to look at whether they financially make sense.\u201d After confirming she could not absolutely guarantee any Diamond League meetings in Britain in 2021, Coates said: \u201cIf we were to have one I would imagine it would be London.\u201d UKA has held tentative discussions with other broadcasters, including ITV and Sky, and will be able to point to encouraging viewing figures of 1.4m for Friday night\u2019s action despite Dina Asher\u2011Smith, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir swerving the event. In the absence of the biggest names, the best performance on Saturday came from the 22-year-old Daniel Rowden, who highlighted his immense potential by winning the 800m from Jake Wightman in 1min 45.94sec. \u201cI am very happy after a difficult year with surgery in April 2019 so it has been a tough road back,\u201d said Rowden, whose time was the fastest at these championships since 1992. \u201cTo take the British title for the first time is incredible.\u201d Coates said it was disappointing so few top athletes had turned up in Manchester but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticise them for the choice they make because our whole new strategy is going to be about putting our athletes first. \u201cI understand they\u2019ve had big pay cuts because of Covid-19, where they haven\u2019t been able to compete. I understand they\u2019ve got obligations to sponsors and they need the money from competition. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s disappointing. We need strong viewing figures so broadcasters know that this is a well-loved and well-watched sport.\u201d Coates also hopes that a new team, led by the performance director, Sara Symington, and the head coach, Christian Malcolm, will give athletes greater confidence in UKA. \u201cWe know the situation we have been in and we have started to come out the other side now,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
