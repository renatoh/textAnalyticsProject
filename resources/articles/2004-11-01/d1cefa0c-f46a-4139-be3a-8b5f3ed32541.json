The diminutive Williams had been an afterthought in the Welsh squad and yet, for more than an hour, one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history beckoned as a supposedly weakened Welsh team tossed caution aside. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that was the most important match of my career,\" recalls the 25-year-old Williams, who has been a fixture in the side ever since. \"I had not played for Wales for two years, apart from a friendly against Romania in what was largely a second-string side, and when Steve [Hansen] rang me to say I was in the squad, I thought it was a wind-up.\" Named as Wales's third scrum-half, a position Williams was not even considered for by his region, Neath-Swansea Ospreys, he had sat out the opening three pool games as Wales laboured to victory against Canada, Tonga and Italy. With their place in the quarter-final assured, the then Wales coach Hansen - who tomorrow returns to the Millennium Stadium as part of the New Zealand management team - made a number of changes for the final group match against the All Blacks. \"I went on to the field knowing it could be my last game for Wales,\" Williams says. \"I had missed the other three matches and I was burning with frustration. I almost missed my chance because of illness, and when the match started I resolved to get my hands on the ball as often as I could and run with it.\" Rarely had a New Zealand defence been as exposed as it was by Wales in Stadium Australia. Williams was a constant menace and the No8 Jonathan Thomas made gainline breaks which helped Wales take the lead going into the last quarter before a debatable try helped the All Blacks rally and win a classic 53-37. \"I have never questioned why Steve chose me for the game against New Zealand,\" Williams says. \"The fact I had not been involved with Wales before when he had been in charge was down to me, not him. My performances had not been good enough. I had started to wonder whether I was good enough to play at the top level, and having tasted success once, I was all the more determined to enjoy it once again.\" Williams had made his Wales debut more than three years before under the now New Zealand coach Graham Henry, bewitching and bedazzling with his dancing feet. He went from being an unknown outside his native west Wales to seeing his face adorning advertisement hoardings, but his fall was as rapid as his rise. \"My life changed when I played for Wales and scored a couple of tries,\" said Williams. \"Graham did his best to protect me, but I picked up an injury and struggled to regain my form. Before I knew it, I was on the outside again and in danger of becoming the forgotten man of Welsh rugby.\" When Henry left in February 2002, Williams was ignored by Hansen until the match against Romania six weeks before the start of the World Cup and Williams rekindled memories with two tries. The All Blacks will, of course, know what's coming this time. Williams will once more be marking Doug Howlett. \"Howlett is one of the best wings in the world and I knew I had to match him,\" Williams says.\"I regard this game as a potential make-or-break for me again: we have a new coach in Mike Ruddock and we have to start converting narrow defeats against the top sides into victories. We are a stronger side than we were a year ago, but New Zealand are arguably the strongest team in the world and we are going to have to get everything right.\" One year on, Howlett will be watching out for Williams. \"He was all over the place and I am going to have to be on my toes,\" says the New Zealander. \"Wales have given us two hard games in the last couple of years and we know we are in for a third on Saturday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
