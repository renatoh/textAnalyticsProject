Bald eagles soared high while Arctic Terns performed their aerobatics. Glacier-covered mountains occasionally broke through the shifting clouds. It was the last morning of a 140-mile rafting journey down the Yukon's Tatshenshini River, a trip when I had been colder than in the depths of winter and hotter than in the dog days of August. Starting in the Yukon Territory, running through British Columbia and reaching the sea on Alaska's Pacific coast, the \"Tat\" is one of the few great wildernesses left on the planet. Home to moose, grizzly bear, wolf and beaver, the Tatshenshini-Alsek Wilderness Park, the Kluane National Park and Alaska's Wrangell-St Elias make up the world's largest uninterrupted protected bio-reserve - 8.5m hectares - and is now a Unesco world heritage site. Ten days earlier, when we entered the water at Dalton Post, the sun was out and a river breeze kept the mosquitoes at bay. Our party of 14 rafters and four guides were heading for white water. Forty-five minutes later, we entered the canyon, and we hit the white water like a bundle of clothes in the spin cycle. The sound was deafening. Freezing water crashed over the bow soaking everybody. Deep holes dragged us down below the horizon, surrounding the boat with a wall of water. We sped past fallen trees, any one of which could have shredded our inflatable raft, no matter how tough the rubber. Crashing through the last of the canyon's waves, with all boats and passengers intact, we all looked like kids after their first ride on a roller coaster, albeit a little wetter. By the time we set camp at Silver Creek, it was getting close to 10pm, and we still hadn't eaten. While the meal was cooking, the lead guide Ron Morrison gave us the mandatory bear talk. \"It's very important not to leave anything with an odour inside your tents,\" he said. \"Everything from bubble gum wrappers to deodorant sticks to toothpaste. A grizzly bear can even smell soda pop in an unopened can.\" By day four, I was beginning to smell, but then so was everybody else. We got an early start from Sediments Creek, and headed south for Stairway to Heaven, the next campsite. Before then, however, lay Monkey Wrench Rapids. The name dates from the 1980s, before the Tatshenshini became a protected park. A mining outfit was surveying the area as a potential copper mine and unknown river guides would reputedly pull out the surveying stakes, throwing a monkey wrench into the works. This kind of grassroots opposition to development, along with some high-powered sentiment from vice-president Al Gore, led to the Tatshenshini-Alsek getting park status in 1992. Strict guidelines keep the number of visitors in the park to about 1,500 per year. Harsh, cold winters limit the rafting period to just over three months, late June through to early September. Although a difficult landing, Stairway to Heaven was the best campsite yet. By now everybody was an expert at setting up and breaking down the tents. So far, they had stood up to the elements. The only thing I regretted was not bringing a pad to put under my sleeping bag. Our wildlife count so far was four grizzly bears, three moose, a beaver and a number of bald eagles. Nobody ventured far without a pair of binoculars. Scanning the river's edge, I spotted a black, slow-moving animal on the far shore I swore was a bear. The rest of the group raised their binoculars, making it look more like a scene from Royal Ascot than a campsite in the wilderness. But what I actually saw was a black wolf, which the guides said are quite uncommon. With the sun going down after midnight, I sat perfectly still at the river's edge, sipping glacially-cooled Yukon Jack whisky, watching the ice-covered peaks turn pink while eagles floated on the last of the day's warm updrafts. We arrived at Melt Creek on the afternoon of day six, surrounded by the mountains of the Noisy and Fairweather ranges. This is grizzly territory. The thick spread of glacial ice on both mountain ranges forces the bears down along the river valley. The coolness of late afternoon and evening is when they are most active. Nobody spotted a bear, but it didn't matter. Watching the sun inch across the horizon, glistening off the jagged peaks and finishing in a slow red sunset was enough. By now, the river had changed dramatically. Just beyond Melt Creek, the Tatshenshini merges with the Alsek River, more than doubling its size to a mile wide, with the valleys stretching to six miles across. The weather had also changed. Warm, damp coastal air from the nearby Gulf of Alaska had moved up the valley to meet the drier air from the interior, resulting in heavy rain. Accompanied by a big drop in temperature, suddenly it felt more like November than June. On day eight, we paddled for Walker Glacier, and crossed into Alaska. Against a strong headwind, the guides fought for every yard of water, the rest of us hunkering down inside our life jackets, drenched and shivering with the cold. Rounding Weather Corner, we caught our first glimpse of the glacier, a hulking mass of blue ice looking as ancient as the mountain it clung to. The glacier has a crusty, pebble-like covering of frozen snow, making walking a little tricky and somewhat dangerous. In front of us, a wall of ice rose 300ft above us, but it's too dangerous to get any closer than a few hundred yards. By the time we arrived at Alsek Lake on day 10, we were well and truly rained in. With nothing to do except eat and try to stay dry, the guides organised an impromptu talent contest. Watching and listening to my fellow raft mates' basic campfire poetry, song and comedy antics, I thought this must have been how it was during the pioneer days. With no modern technology, entertainment was what you made of it. My last night was spent sleeping in a puddle; the tent finally gave up. It didn't matter. Reflecting on the trip, and tomorrow's journey back to the 21st century, I didn't want to leave.
