Crowe, giving the annual Cowdrey Lecture on the spirit of cricket at Lord's last night, attacked the ICC for allowing suspect actions to creep into the game at the highest level. The ICC introduced a law allowing a 15 degree margin for the straightening of bowlers' actions two years ago, effectively legalising all but the most blatant of suspect actions. But Crowe said: \"I don't care about talk of 15 degrees here or 10 degrees there . . . if by the naked eye a bowler is clearly chucking - even by one degree - he should be chucked out. To straighten your arm from any bent position is a massive advantage over other bowlers.\" Crowe did not identify the bowlers he believed should be removed from the game but made a thinly veiled reference to the prolific Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. \"Having been pinned in the head by chuckers over 15 years, having been dubiously bowled first ball in a Test by a certain Sri Lankan bowler, having tried to bowl a decent ball myself with a straight arm, I've had more than enough of this aspect of the game,\" said Crowe. \"If the umpire believes he has seen a throw then he should, as part of the laws of cricket, be allowed to no ball it or at least report it.\" Crowe also criticised the inclusion of Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, the two weakest members of the Test-playing nations, on the Test rota. \"Bangladesh have played a staggering 44 Tests for one win over just six years - they simply aren't going to make it . . . they just won't ever compete successfully against the top eight. Let's face it, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe are being kept on the international stage for political reasons.\" Australia are so desperate for Glenn McGrath to be fit for the Ashes that they are prepared to do without him in the Champions Trophy. The 36-year-old fast bowler missed this year's tours to South Africa and Bangladesh to help his wife recover from cancer but her improved condition means he is ready to prepare for the winter. The Australian selectors are happy to let him play in the Champions Trophy from October 7 if he wishes but the final of that tournament is on November 5 in Mumbai, only 18 days before the Ashes series begins. \"That will be something we'll talk through with Glenn and the Australian coaches,\" the chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said. \"We need to make sure Glenn's programme is exactly as he wants it and we need it to be so he's ready to play in the Ashes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
