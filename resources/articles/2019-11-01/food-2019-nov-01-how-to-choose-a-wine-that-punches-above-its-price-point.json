It naturally prompted vigorous disagreement depending on the standpoint and loyalties of those involved, but Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Napa Valley and, surprisingly to me, New Zealand were the most commonly mentioned suspects. As with most things on Twitter, it was also wildly oversimplified. Of course there are good wines from all those regions, though I struggle to find much to write about in the Napa Valley. The problem is that there is often a disconnect between value for money and reputation. Big names, both producers and region, generally command high prices that are not always warranted, or that you\u2019d be willing to pay. For example, you\u2019d be better off buying Benjamin Leroux\u2019s very delicious Bourgogne C\u00f4te d\u2019Or Pinot Noir 2018 (13%) at \u00a323.30 from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd than his Nuits St Georges 2017 at \u00a337.50, unless you were going to tuck it away for several years. There is a lot of decent basic bordeaux around that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg, but St Emilion rarely justifies its high cost. Things move on, too. At one time, chablis was hugely over-rated, but own-label chablis is, I think, both reliable and fairly priced, and a downright bargain if you get it on promotion or on a supermarket discount. By contrast, albari\u00f1o, which is rather more fashionable these days, often disappoints this drinker, at any rate, despite steadily creeping up in price. Consistency is definitely a factor in whether something is over- or under-rated. That\u2019s partly due to vintage, true, but it is more a question of style and price point. Brands and blends tend to be consistent, while wines from producers that essentially just buy in juice on price are less so. It\u2019s also a question of taste: if you like a traditional, oak-dominated crianza or reserva rioja, say, you may find some more modern examples too forward and fruity; and if you love New Zealand sauvignon blanc, you may not appreciate more restrained versions that don\u2019t have that pungent, gooseberry and passionfruit character. And Italian wines, with a few notable exceptions such as Gavi, are more than usually hard to pin down in style. There are also wines (mainly French, it has to be said) that just fall under the radar. Muscadet has been eclipsed by picpoul. Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 is almost always cheaper \u2013 and better \u2013 than a comparable sancerre. Riesling is almost always reasonable. Sherry ditto. Take advantage, people! Four wines that punch above their price point Wm Morrison The Best Petit Chablis 2017 \u00a38.75 on promotion, 12%. Classy little chablis with a year\u2019s bottle age. Good for drinking now. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Douro Red 2017 \u00a310.50, 14.5%. As rich and full-flavoured as you\u2019d expect from a wine based on port grapes, Douro reds rarely disappoint. Think beef stew. Morrisons The Best Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine 2018 \u00a36.50 on promotion, 12%. Massively under-rated, crisp, fresh seafood wine \u2013 drink with oysters or moules marini\u00e8res. Cune Rioja Gran Reserva 2013 \u00a311.50 Tesco. Eleven (or so) quid is really terrific value for this elegant, sophisticated gran reserva: Cune is a reliable name to look out for. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
