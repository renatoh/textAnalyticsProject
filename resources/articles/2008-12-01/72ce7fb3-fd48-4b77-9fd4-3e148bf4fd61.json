When the men from Abu Dhabi bought the club, their early statements boasted of how they would match Manchester United and here in one respect they did. Rescuing games with last-minute goals has been a trick trademarked at Old Trafford while City have spent 30 years tossing results into the Ship Canal. Now, with the game all but gone and with three-quarters of Ewood Park taunting Mark Hughes, a man who had won them the League Cup as a player and who had taken them into Europe as a manager, they showed some resistance when it mattered. At a time when the headlines are all about whom Manchester City might buy rather than the players they already have it was ironic that the man who salvaged the game was a teenage footballer who may be on the verge of leaving the club. Under Sven-Goran Eriksson, when Manchester City was the plaything of a mere multimillionaire, Daniel Sturridge had been seen as one of the club's great young hopes. Now, with his side two down and with a couple of minutes of regular time remaining, he clipped home a low cross that appeared to offer Hughes only a fig leaf of consolation. And then in the last throes of stoppage time he delivered a pass through a mass of Blackburn defenders that finished at Robinho's feet. Early in the first half the Brazilian had spurned a net that seemed gapingly empty; this time he did not miss and Hughes sprinted down the touchline, his overcoat billowing behind him, embracing the chill air and the relief that another embarrassing defeat, to go with reverses against West Bromwich, Wigan and Bolton, had been averted. The 19-year-old has long been coveted by Chelsea and, as he is in the final year of his contract, he can begin negotiations with a new club next month. \"I don't know how that happened,\" Hughes said. \"If I had been there sooner, I wouldn't have allowed it. That sort of thing puts a player in a position of power. I want to keep him because this is the best place for him.\" His opposite number, Sam Allardyce, shook his head in despair, his players slumped to their knees as if beaten, which mentally they had been. \"The players will wake up tomorrow morning, see the table and wonder why they haven't got 20 points. They have only themselves to blame,\" he said. \"When that final pass came in we had nine men behind the ball and not one of them was watching Robinho. The only reason for that is fatigue.\" Otherwise, said Allardyce, who might have won each of his Christmas matches but drew them both, it had been \"tactically, almost perfect\". Given that Benni McCarthy and Jason Roberts have now scored five times in Allardyce's three games in charge of Blackburn, the need to keep Roque Santa Cruz, who watched what everyone at Ewood assumes will be his future employers from the stands, does not appear that obvious. City had begun as if the 5-1 rout of Hull on Boxing Day had released all the tensions that had begun to cripple this club. They were neat, they were inventive and they looked as if they possessed the most expensive footballer these islands have seen. Before the match was a quarter of an hour old Robinho might have settled matters. Had he not been so determined to stay on his feet when challenged by Andre Ooijer as he danced into the area, he might have won a penalty and moments later he should certainly have put Manchester City ahead. Everything bar the finish was perfect but the finish was comic. It was only the second time this season that Manchester City have gone a goal down and recovered to take a point \u2013 the other was also a 2-2 draw, at Hull. The beautiful interplay between McCarthy and Roberts that produced Blackburn's first was not the kind of move associated with an Allardyce side, although the second that should have put the game completely out of City's reach was \u2013 a free-kick was nodded on by Chris Samba's muscular header and finished off by Roberts \u2013 straight from the Big Sam manual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
