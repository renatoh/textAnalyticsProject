They are the building blocks of our bodies. They can grow into any of the tissues that make us up, including bone, muscle, skin, brain cells, heart cells and those in our organs. If scientists can harness their potential, they could find new ways to study diseases and even make \"spare parts\" to replace damaged tissues. Why are they so controversial? Scientists get embryonic stem cells from spare embryos created at IVF clinics. Pro-life organisations object because embryos are destroyed in the process. How have scientists overcome the problem? Scientists no longer need embryos to make embryonic stem cells. Instead, they take adult skin cells and add genes that convert them into \"induced pluripotency stem cells\", or iPS cells, which behave the same way as embryonic stem cells. Is it safe? The first so-called iPS cells were made by injecting viruses into adult cells. It would be too dangerous to use these in patients. The latest research does away with viruses, making the cells much safer. When will they be used? Scientists must overcome two major hurdles before the new cells can be used in patients. First, they must work out reliable ways of turning stem cells into different tissues. Second, the cells must pass rigorous safety checks to prove they will not harm patients, for example by growing out of control and causing cancer. Is this the end of using embryos? Most scientists believe it would be shortsighted to give up research on stem cells taken from embryos. Embryo-derived stem cells are still the most versatile and seem to work best, and the new technique has not been around long enough to be certain it will work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
