I could see what he was getting at - like grunge, britpop and Gloria Estefan comebacks, packages to Malta were all the rage in the 90s but since then, other than stalwart blue-rinse support, the island's appeal has dwindled. On closer inspection, however, his outfit seems a little wide of the mark. I challenge my buddy to spend one minute in The Valletta G-House (07813 988827, vallettahouse.com, from \u00a3399 per week, sleeps 2) without rethinking his future 90s-themed attire. It's one of the finest apartments I've ever seen. Entering though the small wooden door on a quiet road in the east of Valletta, Malta's tiny capital city, a photographic interpretation of Gericault's Raft of the Medusa dominates the reception area of the 16th-century townhouse. Downstairs, the kitchen is sculpted out of a white limestone cellar under large crossed arches. Stone steps wrap around the side of the apartment leading up to the bedroom, where a huge bed with polished oak posts sits on a stained-tile mosaic floor. Under a roof pinned by four thick timber beams, framed pictures of smouldering males and another dramatic photographic interpretation add a twist of camp. Malta's self-championed emergence as a bastion of packaged holidays and cruise liner tourism made one rather fortuitous omission. The five-star hotels of Sliema and St Julians and the resorts in the north-east were bundled up in packages and sold in abundance, leaving Valletta, the tiny Unesco world heritage capital city, largely untouched by tourism. A grid of thin undulating streets all clad in white honey-glazed stone, it feels like an unpolished, less toy-townish version of Dubrovnik. But for most visitors to this tiny island in the Med, it's a day-visit at most. And another apartment on the other side of the city manages, just, to trump the G-House. Stylistically, the Maison La Vallette (00356 7948 8047, maisonlavallette.vallettasuites.com, from \u00a361 per night,sleeps two) is cut from the same cloth: baroque splendour blended with immaculate modern furnishing, crafted against the same stone-walled canvas, again with an unmistakable dash of belle \u00e9poque camp - both apartments are the side-projects of gay men with fashion photography backgrounds. And, again, it's remarkably good value. If Malta is \"re-inventing\" itself, it certainly isn't doing it intentionally. Maison La Vallette and the G-House are independent ventures; a relative rarity in a country obsessed with flogging itself. But were the authorities to pitch Valletta as a weekend city-break destination they've got a near perfect body of material to work with. So, we've got the boutique beds, what about the rest? Malta's cultural heritage is beautifully hybrid, forged from tenures under the multinational knights of St John, the Sicilians, the Ottomans, and, most recently, the British. In Valletta's main square I sup coffee purchased from an Italian art-nouveau cafe sited opposite a huge French baroque facade, with a couple of red British phone boxes in the middle. Navigating the city involves plodding down roads with names such as \"Old Bakery Street\", written, of course, in Arabicised Maltese. The big-hitters are fairly obvious. The view over the Grand Harbour from the Upper Barrakka Gardens is awesome; leaning over the edge I spend ages imagining the entire Mediterranean fleet filling the ancient port 68 years ago, and ferocious fighters whizzing overhead - the entire island was awarded the George Cross for its bravery during the second world war. St John's Co-Cathedral would put most European cathedrals to shame. The Proscenium arches, marble-inlay tombstones, and manically ornamented everything are an incredible testament to the Knights of St John's endless attempts to keep up with the Medicis. And in the back room, a giant Caravaggio. The mercurial Italian spent 14 months on the island painting before duffing up a local organ-player and legging it, leaving in his wake the astonishing realist masterpiece, The Beheading of St John. For more modern pursuits, the St James' Cavalier Centre for Creativity (+2122 3200, sjcav.org) is aptly named, and comes with an accessible twist. Inside the 16th-century fortification is an arthouse cinema showing English language films, three contemporary art spaces, and a theatre-in-the-round. The island's thespian tradition is one of many remaining British legacies - as are its workers' unions, insurance and banking systems, bilingualism, and the preponderance of blue eyes. Theatre at St James' is frequently modern (Equus recently brought Malta its first theatrical willy), and always spoken in English, having taken its lead from the British amateur dramatics. David Niven once auditioned for a part while in Malta with the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and was turned down. Apparently, he stank. And then, of course, there's the rest of the island: prehistoric necropolises, fortified citadels, and some of the best dive sites in Europe. Nothing is too far away, either. By night, Valletta is quiet. The slim post-midnight pickings may be a fundamental obstacle to it becoming a city break destination proper, but this does have its perks. Finding the action feels investigative, a little clandestine, even; wandering down still alleys in the moonlight following muffled noises from cellar bars, sticking your head through wooden doors sniffing for a kitchen. And there is certainly enough to keep you occupied for at least a couple of nights, once you've found it. Spezzo (113 Triq l'Arcisqof/Archbishop Street, +2122 8500) is inside a soaring atrium covered by a glass roof. On the same road, Ambrosia (+2122 5923) is one of the best dining options on the island, next door to the inventively named The Pub, where Oliver Reed had his final drinking session during the filming of Gladiator. But don't come here hoping for big ones - Valletta is perfect for the discerning romantic, probably not for the discerning night owl. The pick of the bunch, though, was Trabuxu (1 Triq id-Dejqa/Strait Street, +2122 3036), a tastefully-styled wine bar in an old vegetable storage cellar. The white walls are dotted with contemporary canvases, the wine menu is top notch, and the cheesecake is obscenely good. Young bohemian locals flit in and out, seemingly all friends of the owner, Chris. Tourists come in here, occasionally, but rarely on purpose. \"Malta pitches itself all wrong,\" Chris muses. \"We push all the rubbish ... but nobody knows about the best bit.\" Spot on, I think, and long may it continue. \u00b7 Air Malta (airmalta.com) flies to Malta from Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow from \u00a371 return including taxes.
