Think of that 1975 Helmut Newton shot of an Yves Saint Laurent Le Smoking in a backlit Paris street. The woman is wearing a tuxedo and tailored trousers with a buttoned-up white shirt, and she\u2019s as sexy as any of his nudes, to my mind. If I walk into a cocktail party and among all the women in dresses there\u2019s one in trousers, she\u2019s the one I want to meet. Tricky, though, I find. I love trousers-for-evening in theory, but in reality (on me) not so much. But do you know what? I think I\u2019ve finally realised where I\u2019ve been going wrong. Here\u2019s the thing: the concept of trousers as eveningwear suggests the trousers should be in some way fancy, but trousers that look nice on real women tend to be quite the opposite. A gold leather paperbag-waist pair look great on Gigi Hadid. Ditto high-waisted latex leggings. Ditto jewel-coloured palazzo pants. Which is great, fine, good for her. But when I try on any that are elaborate \u2013 even a bright colour, or an embellished waistband \u2013 I look in the mirror and, it\u2019s not necessarily that I hate how it looks, just that I feel a bit self-conscious, and suddenly a dress seems as if it might be the answer after all. The trousers that look nice on most of us are simple trousers. You know that already. What are your favourite trousers? Maybe an old pair of jeans. Maybe a hardworking black pair you have on constant standby. Maybe a great pair of tracksuit trousers. Who would name a gold leather pair as their desert-island trousers? Nobody, that\u2019s who. Except maybe Gigi. So it makes sense that your trousers-for-evening should be simple, too. The ones I\u2019m wearing here are an old favourite pair from Whistles; I haven\u2019t worn them in the evening because I think of them as work trousers. But, look! Add a camisole and a pair of heels, and this is a passably dressed-up outfit \u2013 in a pair of trousers I really like and therefore feel relaxed and happy in. Admittedly, this combination lacks the drama and verve of Le Smoking. But evening trousersuits just don\u2019t work on me. I feel as if I\u2019m wearing an unfamiliar uniform, for a job in which I haven\u2019t passed the probationary period. Trousers for evening can be tricky territory. But you won\u2019t go wrong if you keep it simple. \u2022 Jess wears cami top, \u00a326, oasis-stores.com. Trousers, Jess\u2019s own. Heels, \u00a399, kurtgeiger.com. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.
