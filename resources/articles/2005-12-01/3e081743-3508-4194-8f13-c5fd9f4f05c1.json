Someone else collected it because he was too sick to travel to Stockholm, but his wider absence cannot be explained by illness. Pinter has become the Macavity of English letters. On Wednesday morning, the finest living British playwright recorded, from his wheelchair, an acceptance speech for the greatest literary prize on earth. Anyone who wished to see an allusion to the talk, played in Sweden that day, would have searched BBC schedules in vain. He got no mention on either of the main television news programmes. Newsnight, voracious for culture, carried nothing. Pinter's speech would have been restricted to the satellite channel, More4, had Channel 4 not decided, at the last minute, to put out a midnight digest. Apart from the Guardian's reprinting of the speech, press coverage was scant or mean. One columnist, echoing Christopher Hitchens' grand polemic on the 'sinister mediocrity' of Harold Pinter, denounced the playwright's 'Nobel rant' even before it had been recorded. There was no word of congratulation from Downing Street, let alone an encomium to a 'people's playwright'. David Hare, who listened to Pinter compose his speech in his hospital bed, thinks the BBC's omission 'disgraceful'. Media lassitude was certainly odd in an age so avid for icons that glory awaits anyone eating a kangaroo's testicle on live TV. Pinter's dissection of ordinary lives made him the first prophet of the reality show. Or, as the citation put it, he 'uncovers the precipice under the everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms'. It isn't simply that the public thinks such tasks better left to Ant and Dec, for the Booker is hyped like Strictly Come Dancing. Pinter, in his critics' eyes, is as over as Westlife and as cantankerous as a Dubonnet-fuelled aunt, dashing off missives against a 'mass-murdering' prime minister and the US president, to whom he composed this awful note. 'Dear President Bush, I'm sure you'll be having a nice little tea party with your fellow war criminal, Tony Blair. Please wash the cucumber sandwiches down with a glass of blood, with my compliments. Harold Pinter.' Such insults do Pinter no favours. He was disgraceful in his misreading of Slobodan Milosevic. The Stockholm speech included the puerile satire of Pinter at his worst. But, at his political best, he has bartered principle for scorn and pursued his loathing of US foreign policy, no matter what derision he inspires. He has done fine work on human rights, in Nicaragua and in Turkey. He has laid himself open to apologists for the Iraq war whose onslaughts on Pinter save them mentioning any error on their part. True, his rage sometimes impairs his judgment. While he lends his characters freedom to develop as they will, he sees politicians who displease him as monofocal tyrants, conniving wilfully at murder. Pinter's error is to play their game. His political model, like Bush's, is one of good and evil, in which two adversaries scream abuse across a shattering world. Bush is wrong, and Pinter mostly right, but his crusade is marred by his blindness to the nuances separating political folly, expediency, lies, and raw psychosis. Pinter, often a bad advocate for a good cause, has frequently seemed more useful to his enemies than his friends. Chief among those foes is Hitchens, who called him 'a writer of doggerel, a very poor man's Beckett ... a bigmouth who has strutted and fretted his hour upon the stage for far too long'. To damn Pinter's artistic work along with his politics is absurd. Nor is he vainglorious. Few who saw last week's speech could not have wept, though he courted no pity. Now 75, Pinter cannot walk after an illness unrelated to the oesophageal cancer from which he rallied. He spoke of torture and children sacrificed to war. His voice clotted in his throat as he rasped out a message so thick with death that he seemed to be uttering his own eulogy. Harold is not dying, his friends insist, but the shadow of death - his own or other people's - is never far away. 'I remember how to die,' he wrote in a recent poem about cancer, but he has always brooded over mortality. His plays, he explained, began with one word. For Old Times it was 'Dark', a staple of Pinter's vocabulary. I met him only once. He had not wanted to do the interview, faxing sick notes like a third-former trying to get off swimming ('I have a chest infection. I must lead a quiet life.') But when I eventually arrived, he had uncorked some wine and page-marked one of Eliot's Four Quartets. 'O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant.' Eliot's passenger manifest for outer darkness, 'the captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters', could now be extended to include Harold Pinter. Along with John Osborne, he dragged theatre out of the drawing room and into the bedsit, the battlefield and the torture chamber. Few writers knew less about the ordinary man, yet captured him more perfectly. For that, he has won the honour once conferred on V S Naipaul and Seamus Heaney. The Nobel prize has not always gone to such worthy figures. The Academy has picked some shockers. But Pinter's enemies, in echoing Mrs Beckett, who cried: 'Quelle catastrophe, tu as gagn\u00e9', on learning of her husband's victory, are not thinking of the thin reputation of past laureates. They are livid that the prize has gone to a man they revile, partly because they dare not think he is more right than they are. Pinter is a worthy victor. He is often quixotic, and on the Balkans he was very wrong, but he has explicitly been awarded this prize for his art and not his personal politics. And besides, he is more prescient than his detractors ever allow. Torture and war crimes, no longer the province of mouthy playwrights and far-off demagogues, are too close to home for anyone's comfort. The demonising of Pinter reflects the worst of Britain. This is a country that speaks of freedom while devising new laws to muzzle dissonant voices, a place that abhors censorship, while choosing, for him, a harsher punishment. Pinter, though free to say what he likes, has shouted the best speech of his flagging life into the darkness that haunts him. Citizens in a robust democracy should all be able to watch him demolish a prime minister and a president and decide for themselves whether he is right or wrong. Instead, Pinter's refusal to compromise has left him marginalised, 'open to all the winds, some of them icy indeed'. But those who misrepresent him as an untalented fool are in a colder place. All he has tried to do, besides writing some of the best plays of the last century, is to rail against injustice. Such proof of its existence hands Harold Pinter a greater victory than the one bestowed on him last night in Sweden. m.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
