In fact, it creeps ever closer to the brink of meltdown. But there are also huge differences between the clubs of England and France and many were exposed in this enthralling contest, won in the end by the side that refused to give in when it seemed they were on to nothing but a hiding. Racing set out to overwhelm Saracens physically. They looked bigger and ran harder and, as early as the third minute, slipped into excess. David Strettle, fresh from being selected for the England squad for the Six Nations, was felled from behind by the swinging right arm of Fabrice Estebanez, a centre once picked by Marc Li\u00e8vremont for the France team. The full safety procedure before a potentially serious neck injury was triggered and the game stopped for 10 minutes, time aplenty to see multiple replays of Estebanez's dastardly deed. Strettle had been knocked clean out and was carried off, but was up and about in the changing room by the end of the game. Estebanez played on but awaits a call from the citing commissioner, Eddie Walsh of Ireland. The game eventually restarted and Racing reignited the power boost, storming through tackles to score three tries in the opening quarter. Sakiusa Matadigo and Sireli Bobo added a Fijian extravagance to the heavyweight basics, and Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez brought some Argentinian precision kicking to the assaults. Juan Imhoff brought some Argentinian speed to the formula too, scoring two tries from the right wing. Saracens stayed in the contest thanks only to the kicking of Owen Farrell. Tiny in comparison to all the bulk around him, he slotted kick after kick, heading towards a record number of penalties, 10, in a Heineken Cup match. The chances came his side's way thanks to another clear difference between the two teams: Racing threw themselves horizontally into the breakdown and made life easy for Alain Rolland. The referee may have missed the Estebanez clout but very little in the technical department escapes his French-Irish eye. Rolland never shirks taking a visible part in a game and he was kept in full view, showing four yellow cards: to Will Fraser for a leaping, late challenge on Hern\u00e1ndez; Jone Qovu for a late barge on Farrell; Chris Ashton \u2013 perhaps out of frustration for dropping a regulation kick at the outset of Imhoff's first try \u2013 for thumping Estebanez in the second half; and Benjamin Noirot for climbing all over a Saracen at a ruck. Grouped together the incidents might make it seem like a foul encounter, but what was more telling was the noble fortitude of Saracens. In general they kept their discipline and tightened the defence that had leaked those first-quarter tries. And as their control grew, so Racing unravelled. Giants at the start, their stamina levels were obviously lacking, even by the early minutes of the second half. France may reward rugby players handsomely and offer them an attractive lifestyle, but fitness is not always one of the improvements on offer. Racing were wheezing in the second half, whereas Steve Borthwick, venerable and fit as a flea, grew in stature. Farrell never once looked out of breath, adding a conversion to the try scored by Chris Wyles after Joel Tomkins had glided around Henry Chavancy, and effortlessly stroking over those penalties, the last from near half-way to deny Racing a losing bonus point. Saracens, with Edinburgh to face at home in their last game in Pool 1, are in control of their qualification. Racing will not go through. The clubs of England and France share a cause off the field; on it, their approach to the game could not be more contrasting.
