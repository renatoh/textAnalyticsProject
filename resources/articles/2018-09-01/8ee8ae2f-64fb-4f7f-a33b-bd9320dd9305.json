He will also raise the prospect of moving more BBC staff out of London, while making a pitch for the BBC to find a way to \u201cspend more on the highest-quality content\u201d \u2013 a move which could require either more funding for the corporation or cuts elsewhere in its output. \u201cIt cannot be right that the UK\u2019s media industry is competing against global giants with one hand tied behind its back,\u201d Hall is expected to tell the Royal Television Society\u2019s London conference on Tuesday. \u201cIn so many ways \u2013 prominence, competition rules, advertising, taxation, content regulation, terms of trade, production quotas \u2013 one set of rules applies to UK companies, and barely any apply to the new giants. That needs rebalancing, too. We stand ready to help, where we can.\u201d Hall will use the speech to warn that young British audiences now spend almost as much time watching Netflix \u2013 which only launched its UK streaming service in 2012 \u2013 as watching BBC television and iPlayer combined. \u201cThis new competition has meant that the time that young audiences spend with the BBC has fallen in recent years,\u201d Hall will tell the conference. \u201cIn TV, it\u2019s fallen from well over five hours a week eight years ago, to around three hours. In radio, from six and a half hours a week to around four and a half.\u201d As a result, the corporation is now attempting to drive more Britons directly to the BBC\u2019s iPlayer and to its audio output, which is due to be rebranded under the BBC Sounds banner later this year, in an attempt to increase consumer loyalty. Hall will also say the British media industry is \u201cchanging so rapidly and the long-term consequences are so profound\u201d that history will judge its current leaders on how well they responded to long-term challenges, rather than remember the day-to-day successes of particular programmes. He has already floated the possibility that the BBC may have to end the provision of free TV licences for the over-75s, with the average age of a BBC One television viewer currently standing at around 61 and rising. Citing Ofcom figures, Hall will warn that Britain\u2019s public service broadcasters \u2013 the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, and regional equivalents \u2013 have cut spending on content in real terms by around \u00a31bn since 2004. He will claim that global streaming companies are not spending enough on British productions to make up the difference, while their UK-based productions tend to focus on material which has a global appeal rather than a distinctly British flavour. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just an issue for us economically, commercially or as institutions,\u201d Hall will say. \u201cThere is an impact on society. The content we produce is not an ordinary consumer good. It helps shape our society. It brings people together, it helps us understand each other and share a common national story. And people are hungry for that. They want content that is relevant to their lives, and they want to see people like them on screen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
