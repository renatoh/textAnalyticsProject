Merson, 34, signed a one-year contract with a year's option after negotiating a pay-off with Villa's manager Graham Taylor. The former England midfielder will earn more than \u00a315,000 a week at Fratton Park. \"Merson is a fantastic signing for this club,\" said Redknapp. \"He will give us Premiership quality and do the job Robert Prosinecki did here last season. Merson is still a top-class player and just the sort to give us a real chance of reaching the play offs.\" Redknapp, who last season sold Peter Crouch to Aston Villa for \u00a35m, has already signed Eddie Howe, Arjan de Zeeuw, Hayden Foxe, Carl Robinson, Richard Hughes, Matt Taylor and Shaka Hislop since taking over in March. He has also borrowed Vincent Pericard from Juventus. Merson became disillusioned during pre-season training at Villa after falling out with Taylor, who made it clear he would only be used as a squad player. Redknapp believes the balance of power is shifting away from players and back to the clubs following a year of financial turmoil. The collapse of the ITV Digital deal and increasing prudence around Europe has left more and more players out of work at the end of their contracts. \"It's getting much easier to sign players than it used to be,\" he added. \"There are more players out of work, looking for jobs, and it means my job is more straightforward.\" Southampton's manager Gordon Strachan, meanwhile, is still waiting for his \u00a33.5m striker Agustin Delgado to return to the country after the Ecuador striker failed to get on a flight which the club had booked him on. \"Delgado did not arrive when we expected him to,\" Strachan said. \"We need to find out if he will be back at a later date or what is happening.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
