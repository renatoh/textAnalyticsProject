But he will need the support of Podemos, \u201cWe can\u201d, the populist leftwing party led by Pablo Iglesias, and other parties, probably including the Basque nationalist party, the PNV. A potential coalition of the traditional rightwing PP, (Partido Popular - People\u2019s party) and rightwing challengers Citizens (Ciudadanos), possibly including the far-right Vox party now looks unlikely. The traditional centre-right party, PP, had a terrible night after a parliamentary term that saw them engulfed in corruption scandals. They lost nearly half their parliamentary base and were all but wiped out in Catalonia and the Basque country. (See the key below for a full list of parties and abbreviations.) Having won their first national parliamentary seat four years ago, Citizens are now challenging the PP for the title of leading rightwing party. On the left, in contrast, populists Podemos saw their voteshare decline as voters returned to the traditional leftwing party, PSOE. Key All parties with seats: PSOE - Partido Socialista y Obrero de Espa\u00f1a, Spanish Socialist and Workers Party, the traditional party of the left. PP - Partido Popular, People\u2019s party, the traditional party of the right. Podemos - \u2018We can\u2019, a populist left party. Citizens - (Ciudadanos, Ciutadans, C\u2019s), a newish rightwing party. EAJ - PNV - Euzko Alderdi Jeltzal, Partido Nacionalista Vasco, both meaning Basque Nationalist Party, a relatively moderate Basque party. ERC - Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Republican Left of Catalonia, a leftwing pro-independence party. Junts/JuntsX - Junts per Catalunya, Together for Catalonia, an alliance of strongly pro-independence groups associated with the exiled Carles Puigdemont.
