Nilsson was appointed by Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson this morning after the club announced Gordon Strachan's departure by mutual consent. And the 37-year-old Swede told Sky Sports News: \"I'm just going to try and do the best I can. \"Then after a few weeks we will have to reassess it again and see how it's going. If everything works out well it might suit me (to stay).\" The former Sheffield Wednesday full-back has been pressed into action immediately and is busy prepaaring his sqaud for tomorrow's Worthington Cup tie at Peterborough. \"My head is still spinning,\" he said. \"I just had a phone call from the chairman last night who said he wanted to meet me this morning when he told me I'm taking charge.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
