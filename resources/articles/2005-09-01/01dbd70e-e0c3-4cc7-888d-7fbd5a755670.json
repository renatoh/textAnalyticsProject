The high street retailer, which revealed last month that it had received an indicative approach from an unnamed party, announced that the approach would value the business at 340.5p a share. In a statement, the chain said discussions were at a \"preliminary stage\", adding: \"The board would wish to stress that ... the proposals being considered are subject to a number of material preconditions and there is no certainty that any offer will be made for the company.\" A spokesman for the Peacock Group refused to discuss who was behind the proposed deal but City sources believed a consortium of six hedge funds led by Goldman Sachs was backing the chief executive, Richard Kirk, to take the company private. If successful, it would be the first time a group of hedge funds had cooperated to acquire a company in the UK. Analyst Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce said the proposed price was at the top end of estimates. He said: \"We believe that at this level an offer would succeed. Life is tough out there and this is not a bad price. We also think that Richard Kirk stands a better chance of raising the funding than anyone else, thus we expect an offer to emerge.\" In the event of a successful bid, Mr Kirk, who joined Peacocks nearly 10 years ago and oversaw its flotation, would see his 6% stake valued at \u00a324m. It is not the first time the discount chain has been the subject of a takeover approach. The Cardiff-based group said in March this year that it was in takeover talks, but discussions collapsed after just 24 hours and the approach was withdrawn. Peacocks was founded in Warrington, Cheshire, in 1884 and moved to Cardiff in the 1940s. The group now operates more than 400 own-name stores as well as the Bonmarch\u00e9 clothing chain aimed at older women and The Fragrance Shop perfume outlets. It employs 10,000 people. The firm has achieved rising sales despite the recent downturn in consumer spending. In April it said sales were 9.3% higher and in July it announced that like-for-like sales rose 2.8%. Earlier this year it announced plans to open more than 70 new stores nationwide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
