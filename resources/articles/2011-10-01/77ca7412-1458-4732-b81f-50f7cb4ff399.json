If Carlos Tevez's wildcat strike taught us anything fresh it was that a profound hostility stews below a layer of tribal adoration and needs only a poke to erupt. Unanimity seized the land as fans of all hues sped to condemn Tevez's treachery. In a subsequent social media debate, only throwing a game was deemed more contemptible than refusing to cross the white line to play. From the land of TV punditry came a rare outburst as Graeme Souness reached for his old tackling boots. In any given month we may see a footballer break another's leg with a vile \"challenge\", cuckold a team-mate, conspire against his manager or sulk outrageously in a game while his comrades fight to overcome a 2-0 deficit. Plenty of players go on strike in matches while staying on the field. The refusal by Tevez to come on in Munich was a betrayal of a much higher order, as so many ex-pros testified. Never mind Sheikh Mansour, Manchester City fans or Roberto Mancini: this was treason against his brothers out there on the pitch. Today's one-man corporations are exposed more and more to the mixed feelings of fans. Like bankers, Premier League footballers appear untouched by the current dark economic realities. Many seem better off than ever as contracts are escaped and ever-higher offers entertained. Much of this is grandstand envy. But players are no longer the loved symbols of an aspirational society we became so accustomed to in what you might call the Blairite David Beckham era. The more you speak to Premier League managers the more you pick up references to \"character\" and the need for exhaustive homework on personality, temperament, background. \"A man's life is not a business,\" Saul Bellow wrote. But Bellow never met Tevez and his camp. In City's refusenik we see a perfect swirl of destabilising elements: complicated and self-serving \"ownership\" structure, restless nature, family dislocation, insecurity about being on the bench and pure greed. Not forgetting a PR machine that evokes the Hollywood scriptwriter William Goldman's amusing memoirs: Which Lie Did I Tell?. Goldman paints a world in which one deceit overlaps another until the author can no longer recognise the truth. Tevez was at that point with his \"misunderstanding\" press release. Mancini has become a kind of Eliot Ness against this culture. His work at City has been framed as a battle against selfishness and ego. When Bayern's Jerome Boateng spoke in midweek of a lack of \"togetherness\" in the sky blue half of Manchester he meant last season, the very year in which Mancini looked to be winning his battle against disunity. Tevez and Edin Dzeko wrecked those labours. Yes, Dzeko, too. It was his lucky day when Tevez staged a rebellion so impertinent that his own sarcastic response to being taken off was eclipsed. All of which brings the modern manager to a question that was always there but has now assumed fresh urgency: Who can you trust? \"With good men you can build a strong team for the future,\" Mancini says. \"This is very important. When you have good men, you can lose some games and it is not important, but in the end you can achieve your target 100%. I have good men. I am sure of this.\" Across town, Sir Alex Ferguson practically X-rays a player's character before taking him on. Equally, the disruptive player is expelled before he can bring the tent down. \"What's he like?\" used to be the standard manager-to-manager inquiry over the phone from offices in the fading light of winter afternoons. The subtext was: will he cheat me, will he bring me down? These days trust is less a box to be ticked than a deal-breaker. Millionairedom places the player beyond the authority of the manager and club, as Tevez has demonstrated with perfect clarity. Strike = lower transfer fee in January = a higher salary for Carlito wherever he ends up. Part emotion, part calculation, his move against the boss will ultimately improve his life by bringing him closer to whatever it is he wants. When the Tevez story blew up I thought of another City dissident who fell out with Mancini. The popular image of Craig Bellamy is of one who brings trouble to a football club but he is no Carlos Tevez. Bellamy's main problem is an excess, not a shortage, of passion for the cause and he is currently dashing about on Merseyside trying to re-establish himself as a Liverpool player. As long as you could handle his more manic moments you could trust Bellamy, but no one would say that about Tevez. Money has empowered the nomadic footballer so that he no longer feels any allegiance to a club. He also sees those above him playing politics, taking their own cut and behaving ruthlessly. The supporter sees it all and wonders who to love. Martin Johnson must take risks for England have a chance England can't win this Rugby World Cup with Jonny Wilkinson at fly-half and Mike Tindall playing inside-centre. They will not win it anyway, on current form, with such a deeply conservative psyche - but unless Toby Flood is installed at No 10 and allowed some creative licence, Martin Johnson's side will bring only sterility to this tournament. Battering a path to the final is a trusted English tactic. The all-means-necessary template was defended again by their most loyal followers in the wake of Saturday's tense win over Scotland. The difference, though, is that in 2003 and 2007 England possessed a pack capable of rescuing them from almost any difficulty. This one lacks the authority and power of those predecessors. Johnson chooses not to see this and instead invests his faith in what he knew as a player during tournaments. But some boldness and adventure will be needed against the southern hemisphere giants. Not a deluge of risk-taking, but certainly a Flood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
