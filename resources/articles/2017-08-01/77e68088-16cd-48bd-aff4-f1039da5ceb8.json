On Thursday, Gordon stayed up all night in case calls came in. Not a single one can go unanswered. The scramble for students was continuing throughout the weekend, with universities hosting pop-up open days and targeting students on social media. Since the removal of the cap on the number of undergraduates universities can recruit, there has been fierce competition to attract students. Some colleges have expanded, while others have seen their intake shrink dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that one or two universities are going to go to the wall in the not too distant future,\u201d said John McCarthy, executive director of marketing and external relations at the University of Salford. This year, the clearing frenzy is especially intense. Not only is the school-leaver population declining, but the looming prospect of Brexit has caused a dip in the number of EU students applying to British universities. On top of this, mature student numbers have continued to plummet, while vice-chancellors warn that visa arrangements are putting off international students. Changes to funding have also hit nursing courses, where there is an 8% drop in students getting places following the removal of bursaries. Changes to A-level exams added a further layer of confusion, said Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at the University of Buckingham. The new qualifications are solely assessed on end-of-year exams, rather than coursework and AS-levels halfway through. \u201cStudents were uncertain about how they were going to perform and I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a lot of variability between schools.\u201d Last week, the scramble to fill places moved more quickly than ever before. \u201cThe rush on the Thursday is increasingly a high-volume rush,\u201d said Christina Edgar, head of student recruitment and admissions at Sheffield University, where calls were up 15%. In England, a record number of students were awarded a place through clearing on Thursday, despite a 13% drop in the number of people using the system this summer. Many Russell Group universities were offering places, including Liverpool University, which advertised spaces for its medical school. Behind the scenes, universities were launching competitive online marketing campaigns, said McCarthy. \u201cWe can be very highly targeted in terms of the students we want to attract using Google, Facebook, Instagram and similar platforms \u2013 we can geotarget people,\u201d he said. Universities were bidding against each other, in real time, to appear higher than one another in Google searches. It was not just competition from rivals that universities were facing: it was also changing student attitudes, said McCarthy. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the economy picking up a little bit and students saying: why should I go to university and pick up \u00a340k debt?\u201d At London South Bank University, Jopser Toro, 20, was one of the prospective students looking around. He worked for two years before looking at universities because he wanted to be sure he was making the right decision. \u201cI started working because I wanted to see what it was like\u2026 [Some people] go to university not because they want to go, but because they think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Friends who had gone in the past sometimes had ended up switching courses or not benefiting from their degree, he added. Toro also wants to live at home, so that he can continue working while studying. Sophie Galustian, a drama and performance student who was helping take clearing calls at the campus, said financial pressures had changed students\u2019 attitudes towards university. \u201cThe whole idea of it being that expensive is off-putting for people our age,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may be about to see a declining interest in going to university and that will lead to the system having to adapt,\u201d added Smithers. \u201cHow it does that I don\u2019t know. Some institutions will have to reconsider their mission.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
