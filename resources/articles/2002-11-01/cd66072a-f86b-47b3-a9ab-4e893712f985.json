The Queen's jeweller recently teamed up with society girl Jade Jagger in an effort to reinvent itself as a modern, fashionable brand. Jagger launched her collection in September at a star-studded party held in the grounds of the Tower of London, where the eclectic guest list ranged from members of So Solid Crew to the Duke and Duchess of York. Advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi created a campaign featuring the likes of Elliott and actor Rupert Everett with their own specially adapted versions of the royal coat of arms. But the spoof warrants infuriated the Royal Warrant Holders Association, which grants the warrants. The organisation ordered Garrard to pull the campaign, saying it was in bad taste. Garrard was established in 1722 and was appointed crown jeweller in 1843. The company made Princess Diana's engagement ring but has hit the buffers in recent years with the decline in the number of tourists visiting London from the US and the Middle East. In 2000 it was taken over by Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian fashion tycoon who owns the Tommy Hilfiger brand, and earlier this year the chief executive, Rosa Monckton, quit amid rumours of a boardroom split over the future of the company. No one at Garrard was available to comment on the embarrassing incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
