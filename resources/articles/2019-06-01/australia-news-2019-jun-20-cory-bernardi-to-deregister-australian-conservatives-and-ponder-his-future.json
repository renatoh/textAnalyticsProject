The renegade South Australian senator who sensationally quit the Liberal party in 2017 to form a Trump-inspired breakaway conservative movement told supporters on Thursday that he believed it was the \u201cwisest\u201d course of action after the party\u2019s poor showing at the May election. \u201cOur candidates, members and volunteers all did their best but as a party we received a tiny fraction of the votes we needed to be successful,\u201d he said in a note to supporters. \u201cThe inescapable conclusion from our lack of political success, our financial position and the re-election of a Morrison-led government is that the rationale for the creation of the Australian Conservatives is no longer valid.\u201d Bernardi attributed the party\u2019s poor result to Scott Morrison\u2019s success as prime minister, saying many potential voters had returned to the Coalition after Malcolm Turnbull was replaced. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull was leading a Labor-lite Coalition into political oblivion. As they abandoned their supporter base in pursuit of green-left policies, major party politics became an echo chamber rather than a battle of ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the decision to make Scott Morrison prime minister truly changed the political climate and our political fortunes. \u201cRather than punish the Coalition for another new leader, many conservatives breathed a sigh of relief that a man of faith and values was leading the Liberals back to their traditional policy platform.\u201d While his party attracted more than 20,000 supporters in its first year and successfully subsumed the SA-based Family First conservative movement, Bernardi was unable to mobilise sufficient electoral support. At the 18 May election, the party won just over 16,000 first preference votes in his home state of South Australia, compared with 53,000 for One Nation and 33,000 for the United Australia party. Many supporters had been confused about the party running only in the Senate and had wanted Bernardi to \u201cdeliberately court controversy\u201d to gain media attention during the campaign. \u201cWhile that may have worked, it would have undermined the very premise of what we offered to the Australian people: a credible and principled alternative to the political fringe,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately steady and sensible didn\u2019t work and it was frustrating that some single-interest parties gained more votes than we did despite having next to no electoral presence or campaign resources.\u201d He would soon begin the process of formally deregistering the Australian Conservatives as a political party, in what he said would be a \u201cdisappointment\u201d for his supporter base. The decision will stoke further speculation about Bernardi\u2019s future in parliament amid speculation that he could rejoin the Liberal party, despite his former colleagues attacking him for his \u201cbetrayal\u201d when he quit. But Bernardi is also understood to be considering whether he quits the Senate altogether, a move that would open up a Senate vacancy for the Liberals in South Australia because he is only midway through a six-year term. \u201cOn 7 February 2017 I told a journalist that political success for the Australian Conservatives could be loosely described as being no longer necessary because the Coalition had returned to its traditional policy roots and would once again win back the confidence of the Australian people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that happened I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be gloriously fulfilled and I\u2019ll go fishing at Coffin Bay.\u2019 \u201cI am not quite ready for the fishing but the Morrison government victory and policy agenda suggests we are well on the way to restoring common sense in the Australian parliament. That is all we, as Australian Conservatives, have ever sought to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
