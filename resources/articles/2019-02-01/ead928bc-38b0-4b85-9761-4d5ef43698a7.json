Sunday\u2019s humiliating 6-0 thrashing at Manchester City, Chelsea\u2019s worst defeat since 1991 and a loss which confirmed a drop from fourth to sixth place, has left Sarri clinging to his position only seven months into a three-year deal. The head coach will hope progress in the Europa League, starting with Thursday\u2019s knockout tie at Malm\u00f6, earns him time, given the competition\u2019s winners gain entry into next season\u2019s Champions League. Yet eliminating the side who finished third in the Swedish league last season would only marginally bolster his job prospects unless a team clearly struggling to come to terms with his tactical demands can improve their performances over a daunting run of domestic fixtures. Chelsea face Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup, Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League before the month is out, games in which the board will expect to see reasons for optimism. Any decision over Sarri\u2019s future would still be taken by Roman Abramovich, despite the fact the owner has not attended a game this season and now spends the vast majority of his time in Russia and Israel. The director Marina Granovskaia remains his eyes and ears at the club and was instrumental in the appointment of the Italian last summer. Sarri\u2019s post-match suggestion at the Etihad Stadium, delivered to his country\u2019s media, that he \u201cnever hears\u201d from Abramovich was apparently not considered as a slight against the owner. Yet there was risk attached when he appeared to echo his predecessor Antonio Conte\u2019s regular complaints about a lack of contact with the real power at the club, even if it is understood that, should Sarri indicate he wishes to speak face to face with Abramovich, a meeting could be arranged. Whether the team\u2019s cluttered schedule would grant the Italian the time to travel abroad and meet the Russian, however, is open to question. Sarri, whose side have yet to score away from Stamford Bridge this calendar year having been soundly beaten at Arsenal and Bournemouth prior to the embarrassment at City, was back at the club\u2019s Cobham training ground late morning on Mondayto oversee his players\u2019 brief warm-down session before preparations began for the last-32 tie in Sweden. The squad split between the gym and work outside on the training pitch, with a small-sided game overseen by the head coach, with the mood described as \u201cworkmanlike\u201d by one observer. The hierarchy will now demand a positive response. They have consistently put out experienced sides in the Europa League this season, albeit often using senior players otherwise on the fringes, and that is unlikely to change this week given the importance now heaped on progress in the competition. There remains the potential for the much maligned Jorginho to sit out that tie, with Mateo Kovacic having been employed in his midfield brief at times during recent games, but a full-strength squad is still expected to travel to Malm\u00f6. Frank Lampard, who has been mooted as a potential successor, not least in the wake of the success instigated by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Manchester United in recent months, moved to distance himself from the position on Monday. \u201cChelsea are certainly a club I respect, and have a manager I respect,\u201d said the Derby County manager. \u201cMy job is here and I\u2019m working very hard. All my thoughts are on Ipswich Town away on Wednesday. I hope to see Chelsea put some form together and turn their results around.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
