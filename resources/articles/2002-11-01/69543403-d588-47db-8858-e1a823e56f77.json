They established a 4-2 lead at home to Bristol City , despite having Lee Williamson sent off, but conceded three goals in the last four minutes to lose 5-4. Wigan Athletic will have been more pleased than anyone that it was Neil Roberts who scored the goal that gave them their 1-0 win at Brentford. As Wigan's captain, Jason De Vos, said: 'He is probably the player who best epitomises the team spirit that the manager Paul Jewell has instilled here. Our fans have mixed feelings about him because he has not scored a lot of goals, but he contributes to our team in lots of other ways.' That win and Oldham Athletic's surprising failure to get more than a goalless draw at home to Cheltenham Town enabled Wigan to stretch their lead to three points. Like Oldham, Queens Park Rangers also slipped up, with a goalless draw at Luton Town, despite the home team's striker Steven Howard being sent off for violent conduct after 14 minutes. Plymouth Argyle 's 4-1 win over Stockport County will have come as a relief to their fans in view of the team's proximity to the relegation zone. It is a big change for Plymouth since last season, when they gained more points than any of the other promoted teams, and their manager, Paul Sturrock, said: 'Teams have made it more difficult for us to build up from the back, so we are being forced to get the ball to the front men earlier. In our position, we are having to become as ugly as a lot of other sides.' Other teams for whom points are more important than the manner in which they are won are Notts County and Colchester United. The Essex side have not been helped by the loss of three of their most influential players - Karl Duguid, Scott Fitzgerald and Gavin Johnson - with long-term injuries. 'They are the first players you think of when thinking about ideal figures for the job of captain,' said manager Steve Whitton. Even so, other Colchester players also showed stirring leadership qualities on this occasion, coming from behind to secure a 3-2 win in Nottingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
