But the opposition leader, appearing on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A, struggled to answer how a government he led would handle asylum seekers. Shorten\u2019s right faction has been facing increasing pressure from members on the left to shift Labor\u2019s asylum seeker policy to a commitment to end indefinite detention, and bring those detained in offshore detention centres to Australia, while permanent resettling options are found. Appearing as the solo panelist on the program, at a special taping in Elizabeth, a northern Adelaide suburb devastated by the closure of the Holden manufacturing plant last year, Shorten struggled to answer an audience member\u2019s question on whether he would end indefinite detention. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWhat we are not going to do is have the boats start again and see hundreds of people drown at sea,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is legitimate for people to want to come to this country. I support a refugee intake. I don\u2019t [think] it is bad for a person to want to come to this country. \u201cI think it is a very brave thing for someone to up sticks and leave their own country and where they come from. But what I can\u2019t ignore is that when we have a policy that sees the people smugglers come across from Indonesia and 1,200 people drown. \u201cI am not going to wash my hands of that and say I don\u2019t care, it is just what happens to you here. \u201cBut the second thing I am going to say is, I don\u2019t believe the [trade-off] of not having the people smugglers back in business is that you keep people in indefinite detention. \u201cI do not believe that \u2026 we should be using people on Manus and Nauru as political scoring points for a debate in Australia.\u201d Asked again if that meant he would end indefinite detention, Shorten said he would need to see what agreements could be struck to resettle asylum seekers. \u201cI do not believe we need to have indefinite detention. I do not believe that is necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the regional resettlement agreements resolved. I do think the government should take the deal with New Zealand ... I do not believe that indefinite detention should be the case, I believe a Labor government can actually make sure that we don\u2019t have to have people on Manus and Nauru, because we will prioritise resettling people.\u201d Labor has consistently led the Coalition in the polls, although Shorten\u2019s personal popularity as alternate prime minister has never kept pace with the opposition\u2019s domination of the polls, the Labor leader lagging behind Malcolm Turnbull as preferred leader. The latest Guardian Essential poll showed Shorten\u2019s popularity drop four points to 33%, while the most recent Newspoll had Shorten\u2019s popularity slipping two points to 30%, giving him the longest-running negative satisfaction for an opposition leader in Newspoll\u2019s history. But Shorten said his focus was on the party. \u201cAs for the government\u2019s \u2018kill Bill\u2019 strategy \u2013 I think it speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it. They say to be prime minister of Australia you have to have a thick skin. Well, the opposition leader\u2019s job is good training for it. I\u2019ll be ready for that,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonal popularity is one challenge, but I tell you what is important \u2013 the job I have had since I was opposition leader. 1: unite the Labor party \u2013 we are doing a bit better than we used to do; 2: be a strong opposition. Ask the banks if they find us a strong opposition. Ask Tony Abbott \u2013 apparently we were so bad at our job, they had to get rid of him. Ask Mr Turnbull if we are strong opposition. We came very close at the last election. A strong opposition, a united team. I\u2019ve got to say, my team is better than his team. \u201cI know where I started so it has been an up and down ride. But I tell you what the polls also tell me ... that any Saturday for the last two years, we would have won the election. Of course, obviously there hasn\u2019t been an election held, so I take it all with a grain of salt.\u201d Shorten reiterated Labor policy to invest in renewable energy, but said he would not be committing a Labor government to a coal-free future. He also rejected buying back national assets, including re-nationalising the electricity sector, and instead said he would focus on market certainty. \u201cI genuinely thought when Malcolm Turnbull took over, at least the climate change debate would end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually got worse. \u201cThe best way to put downward pressure on power prices is to make a very clear policy that you back renewable energy, and in doing that you provide the investment certainty, and then we\u2019ll get the competition and get the Australian know-how, and we\u2019ll get the jobs and the climate change benefits we want.\u201d The prime minister has also been invited to take part in a solo Q&amp;A episode."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
