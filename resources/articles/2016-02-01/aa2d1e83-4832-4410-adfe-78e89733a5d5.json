Isis has begun to respond with increasing urgency as Facebook and Twitter have attempted to block terrorist content on the network. Representatives from both companies were among those who met senior White House officials in January to discuss how to deal with terrorism online. During the latest video, overwritten text proclaims: \u201cIf you close one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased after we delete you [sic] sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true\u201d. In the video the terrorists claim they control more than 10,000 Facebook accounts, 150 Facebook groups and 5,000 Twitter profiles. A Twitter spokesperson said the company wouldn\u2019t be releasing any response, mostly because these threats are now so common. \u201cIt just happens all the time,\u201d the spokesperson said. All the time? With Dorsey\u2019s face? \u201cAll the time,\u201d the spokesperson confirmed. Isn\u2019t that a little scary? \u201cWelcome to our everyday life.\u201d The spokesperson declined to detail exactly how many threats the company has received, though the video seemed to specifically be targeting Twitter for closing Isis related accounts. \u201cYou announce daily that you suspend many of our accounts,\u201d the text reads. \u201cAnd to you we say: Is that all you can do? You are not in our league.\u201d Officer Wilson Ng from the San Francisco police department said he wasn\u2019t aware of any \u201ccredible threats\u201d against Twitter HQ, yet what is more remarkable is how unremarkable these threats have become. A widely circulated Isis statement in March 2015 was addressed directly to Dorsey: \u201cYour virtual war on us will cause a real war on you,\u201d it reads. \u201cYou started this failed war. We told you from the beginning it\u2019s not your war, but you didn\u2019t get it and kept closing our accounts on Twitter, but we always come back.\u201d The post features an image of Dorsey\u2019s face overlaid with the cross sights of a gun. \u201cBut when our lions [brave men] come and take your breath, you will never come back to life,\u201d the post reads. Twitter, which posits itself as a \u201cglobal town square\u201d, has had to reckon with a difficult reality: they\u2019re a major pathway for Isis propaganda. The company has shut down about 125,000 Isis-related accounts, a move which has had significant impact curtailing the terrorist network\u2019s reach, according to a recently released report from the University of Washington. New Isis accounts pop up, but, as many new users soon realize, it takes some time to get as many followers. Facebook is also pushing for an aggressive response to Isis. The company\u2019s COO Sheryl Sandberg has even suggested the social networks can engage in their own warfare against Isis using \u201ca \u2018like\u2019 attack\u201d. \u201cThe best thing to speak against recruitment by Isis are the voices of people who were recruited by Isis, understand what the true experience is, have escaped and have come back to tell the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cCounter-speech to the speech that is perpetuating hate we think by far is the best answer.\u201d German Facebook users organized a campaign to \u201clike\u201d the Facebook page of the neo-Nazi party and then post positive messages on the page, she said as an example. \u201cWhat was a page filled with hatred and intolerance was then tolerance and messages of hope,\u201d she said. The US government has lately been tapping social media giants to help in its fight against Isis\u2019 spreading influence. A secretive summit in San Jose in January involved companies including Apple, Facebook and Twitter and senior security officials including National Security Agency director Michael Rogers. The goal was to launch a social media campaign against Isis. A briefing sent out to the Silicon Valley executives beforehand and obtained by the Guardian read: \u201cWe are interested in exploring all options with you for how to deal with the growing threat of terrorists and other malicious actors using technology, including encrypted technology. Are there technologies that could make it harder for terrorists to use the internet to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
