It sums up the evening that he was still a strong contender for man of the match Saves 0, catches 0, clearances 6 (clearance success rate 66.7%) Micah Richards His night ended with him being carried off on a stretcher and it is easy to feel sorry for the 18-year-old: it isn't this bad even at Manchester City Goal attempts 1 (on target 1, off target 0), passes 28 (success rate 71.4%), tackles 2 (success rate 0%) Rio Ferdinand How can he be judged when Andorra played with one striker and rarely made it into the England penalty area. Immaculate in what he had to do - but that was little Goal attempts 0, passes 62 (success rate 82.3%), tackles 1 (success rate 0%) John Terry It is not often that the England captain looks dispirited and unable to motivate those around him. A picture of professional misery as he led out the team for the second half Goal attempts 0, passes 64 (success rate 96.9%), tackles 2 (success rate 100%) Ashley Cole The Chelsea left-back at least seemed willing to supplement England's attacks as an auxiliary winger but he could only manage to do so with limited success Goal attempts 0, passes 62 (success rate 88.7%), tackles 3 (success rate 33.3%), yellow card Aaron Lennon Diamond ear-rings and a big reputation, yet the Tottenham man was unable to beat Andorra's left-back and might easily have been one of those substituted Goal attempts 0, passes 33 (success rate 84.8%), tackles 2 (success rate 100%) Steven Gerrard Will prefer to remember his two goals rather than his first nutmegging by Justo Ruiz. Not pleased when his wayward free-kick led to the fans calling for David Beckham Goals 2, goal attempts 5 (on target 5, off target 0), passes 88 (success rate 79.5%), tackles 3 (success rate 33.3%) Owen Hargreaves Excels when breaking up opposition attacks in a position between defence and midfield but this was a match when England simply did not require a holding midfielder Goal attempts 1 (on target 0, off target 1), passes 74 (success rate 90.5%), tackles 6 (success rate 100%), yellow card Stewart Downing Must regard England duty like a prison sentence given some of the abuse he receives and the blood had drained from his face within 15 minutes. His marker was a builder Goal attempts 3 (on target 1, off target 2), passes 54 (success rate 87%), tackles 0 Wayne Rooney Played as though in a straitjacket and picked up a yellow card and will miss the next match. Something is seriously wrong. Has he ever looking so uninterested? Goal attempts 2 (on target 0, off target 2), passes 14 (success rate 57.1%), tackles 1 (success rate 100%), yellow card Andrew Johnson He has had his opportunity and he has blown it. Jermain Defoe has his critics but he would almost certainly have had more impact over England's past two matches Goal attempts 2 (on target 1, off target 1), passes 9 (success rate 100%), tackles 3 (success rate 66.7%) Substitutes Jermain Defoe (for Rooney, 61) Kieron Dyer (for Richards, 61) David Nugent (for Johnson, 79) Not used Ben Foster, Jamie Carragher, Gareth Barry, Michael Carrick"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
