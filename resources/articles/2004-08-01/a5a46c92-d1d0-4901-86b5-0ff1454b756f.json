Reporters will often, as a matter of principle, refuse to disclose their sources even when threatened with fines or jail since the ability of whistle-blowers and others to tell their stories to the media, safe in the knowledge that their identities will never be revealed, is seen as fundamental to a free press. The law in the UK provides significant protection for journalists when it comes to sources. But now the protection of sources is being put in jeopardy by some recently implemented legislation. Under one provision of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which came into force in January of this year, police, the security services, the military and other officials can ask telephone and internet companies for \"communications data\". Communications data would include the details of who was making or receiving calls and emails to or from a newspaper or journalist. To make such a request, the official must merely believe that the data is necessary for a number of purposes including national security, the prevention or detection of crime or the economic well-being of the country. This would not entitle the authorities to the content of any call or email (under the act, there are much tighter controls on the interception of the contents of such communications). However, often the issue which interests the authorities (as it was in relation to the David Kelly affair last year) is simply the identity of the source rather than what was said. In effect, this means that a police officer could ask BT or a mobile phone company to provide the records for a national newspaper or a reporter and see who has telephoned them on any particular day. This might lead to the identification of a confidential source and neither the newspaper nor the journalist would even know that the records had been sequestered in this way. There are three things the media can do to respond. Firstly, they can deter any source contacting them by telephone or email. More elaborately, they could establish a system whereby calls and emails from sources are routed out of the country, meaning that the powers under the act may not be sufficient to trace them. But finally, the media could consider an application to the court for a declaration that access by the police and others to their telephone records without even any notice to them is contrary to their right to freedom of expression under the European Convention of Human Rights since it means that the protection of confidential sources cannot be guaranteed. The protection of sources - particularly from the state - remains an important issue for journalists. The press will be reluctant to see its established protections against naming sources eroded by these new investigatory powers. Until the law is clarified, sources and journalists should be on heightened alert that their communications do not lead to sources' identification. \u00b7 Dan Tench is a media partner at Olswang"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
