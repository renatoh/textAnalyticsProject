It also shines a torch on one of the City's more exotic financial instruments, Contracts for Difference. Last week it emerged that the Financial Services Authority had started an investigation into CFD trading in Selfridges by Victor Tchenguiz, Robert's father. CFDs are a way of buying shares without paying the full price. Typically, you will have to put up a deposit - or margin, to give it the technical term - of around 10 per cent of the total cost, although that will vary depending on how well your broker knows you and how easy it is to buy shares in your chosen company. The broker will charge commission, typically around 0.25 per cent, and a daily rate of interest that reflects the fact that it has had actually to buy the shares. But if, as is common, you hold the CFD for only a short period, these costs will be outweighed by the saving from not having to put up the full cost of the shares and avoiding stamp duty, which is only payable if you actually take delivery of them. The advantage to you is that, if the share price rises, you will bank all that gain while laying out only a tenth of the price. That gearing effect can bring you big profits if you guess correctly. The downside is that if your guess is wrong, losses can be substantial - you would have to pay the broker the full difference between the price at which the CFD was struck and the price when you decided to end the contract. CFDs can also be used to go 'short' on the market or on particular shares - jargon for betting that prices will fall. That has made them particularly popular with private investors during the prolonged bear market. They are also increasingly popular with professionals. Both hedge funds and conventional fund managers use them extensively and even smaller investors are warming to them. But their most controversial use has been in takeover battles, starting eight years ago when Trafalgar House built up a stake in target Northern Electric through CFDs. That led the Takeover Panel to extend existing rules, which require bidders to disclose their shareholdings, to include CFDs and other derivatives. In January, the panel censured Robert Bonnier, the former investment banker, for failing to disclose that he had 'closed out' - or ended - a CFD in shares in Regus, which gave him an effective 13 per cent stake in the office services company in which he was considering a bid. Last year, fashion entrepreneur Shami Ahmed used CFDs when he was stalking the menswear group Moss Bros, building an effective holding of 5.4 per cent of the group, although he physically owned only 0.3 per cent. In the wake of the Regus affair, the Department of Trade and Industry is considering whether to intro duce new disclosure rules on the ownership of CFDs. Although the panel requires their disclosure during bids, under company law stakes in CFDs do not have to be disclosed. That reflects the fact that, although holders are exposed to share price risk, they do not actually own the shares so do not have the right to vote. They will get most of the benefit of dividend payments although the broker, which physically owns the shares, is likely to take a cut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
