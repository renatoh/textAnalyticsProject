The Number, which operates the 118 118 service, scored a huge hit with its multimillion pound retro advertising, starring two moustachioed runners wearing red and white running strips and the identical number, 118. The campaign, launched exactly a year ago when the directory inquiries market was deregulated, won dozens of awards and helped the 118 118 service beat off a slew of rivals to become one of the most successful players in the market. But it hit trouble when Bedford, a one-time champion athlete, complained to the media regulator claiming the characters were based on his famous image during the 1970s. Ofcom upheld the complaint ruling that the ads were a \"comically exaggerated representation\" of the runner, although it ruled that no harm had been done to him. Although it stopped short of banning the campaign, Ofcom's ruling came as a blow to The Number and prompted Bedford to sue for damages. The Number today said it was scrapping the popular runners. In a new campaign launching this Friday, the actors will instead play a pair of \"seventies retro cops\" dressed in yellow jumpsuits who are \"out to help the public through life's varied challenges\". But The Number today insisted its decision to scrap the popular characters was unrelated to the threat of legal action, insisting customers wanted \"something fresh\". \"The 118 runners were a huge hit and have become a well-loved feature of street life. 'Got your number' is much more than an advertising slogan for 118 118, and we'd like to reassure fans out there that the 118 boys are here to stay,\" said Alexandria Lewis, the marketing director for The Number. The twins retain their moustaches in the new adverts, which will first appear on March 12, although their long hair has been \"restyled\" into that most famous of 70s styles - the mullet. The new adverts are part of a \u00a310m campaign to promote additional services from 118 118, such as unlimited numbers and cinema listings. The service, which launched in the UK on December 10, 2002, has around 50% of the UK directories market. The 118 runners, played by Colin Carmichael and Darren McFerran, made their advertising debut on March 9 last year. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
