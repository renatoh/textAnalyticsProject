Important museums, including the British Museum and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, have devoted exhibitions to forgeries, while the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London had a small \"fakes and forgeries\" gallery next to the ever-popular cast courts - impressive copies of a more honest kind. The V&amp;A gallery has been temporarily boxed away, although items can be found dotted through many of the displays. Like the old V&amp;A fakes, Magnus Magnusson's study is a bit of a curio itself: an eclectic mix of art forgers, bogus archaeologists, literary fantasists and imposters. It ranges from serious criminals such as \"John Drewe\", the man behind a complex series of art frauds based on doctoring national archives, to Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, the little girls behind the fake fairy photographs that so bewitched Arthur Conan Doyle. Some of the fraudsters aren't fraudsters at all in the sense most of us would recognise: the slaves Ellen and William Craft created false identities (as a white master and his servant) to flee the racist southern states of 19th-century America. Perhaps the message is that faking, like collecting, is something that cuts across gender and social class. If that is the case, it may explain why the public attitude to fraud is so ambivalent. Convicted fraudsters find it hard to gain employment, because employers find them hard to trust. Yet fakers and forgers who perpetuate \"victimless crimes\" that leave people in authority looking silly - such as Han van Meegeren, who fooled most of the Netherlands' top museums in the 1940s with his \"Vermeers\" - receive warmer receptions in the public mind. Magnusson reflects that ambiguity; his brisk and sometimes pointed story-telling does not disguise his grudging admiration for people who find the boundary between truth and lies more permeable than most of us and are willing to capitalise on it. The painter Tom Keating, for example, became a major forger of the visionary 19th-century artist Samuel Palmer in the 1970s. But despite exposure and disgrace, he soon found a living as a TV presenter, thanks to Channel 4, explaining the techniques of the masters. He was little loved by the dealers, auctioneers and collectors he cheated, yet ended up a folk hero. Although Magnusson's book is not an in-depth psychological study of fraudsters, a few common features emerge: most have an unrealistically high opinion of their own abilities, a grudge against the establishment for failing to recognise these talents, and sometimes, but not always, a desire for money or fame. What comes across even more clearly is the willingness of their victims to be duped: scholars wanted to believe that Piltdown Man was genuine, placing the important \"missing link\" between man and ape in British not Middle Eastern or African soil. Americans wanted to believe in the Viking Vinland Map, putting the first exploration of the continent by white men hundreds of years before Columbus. So why did the subject appeal to Magnusson, a veteran writer, historical researcher and broadcaster best known for his years on Mastermind? He says it was a contestant, Leo Stevenson, who alerted him to the scale of art forgery, which in turn inspired this book. Stevenson is a legitimate painter, who creates expensive pastiches of Old Masters (carefully marked with underpainted submarines and the like to make sure they will not pass an X-ray test and slip on to the market as genuine). This is in the main a lighthearted and entertaining book, albeit well researched. Most of Magnusson's cases are historical and tend not to dwell on the darkest sides of the trade, making for a strangely comforting read - all the fraudsters got found out, after all. But the dark side of forgery still exists, and it is not just professional pretensions that are at stake. In Russia this spring, the chief curator of the Tretyakov museum, Vladimir Petrov, blew the gaff on a forgery in which criminals repaint low-grade 19th-century western paintings, altering roofs or fiddling trees to make them look more \"Russian\", for the newly rich and patriotic oligarch market. Petrov said that he himself had been fooled, and authenticated up to 20 of the works as genuine. He and his staff have received death threats (though whether from the mafia forgers or the oligarchs is unclear), and are accompanied everywhere by armed bodyguards. For them, forgery is not a simple scam or a \"victimless\" crime. \u00b7 Jane Morris contributes to the Art Newspaper and Museums Journal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
