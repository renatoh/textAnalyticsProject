The band have now made the 18 MiniDisc recordings, most of them around an hour in length, available on Bandcamp for \u00a318. Proceeds will go to climate activists Extinction Rebellion. The band\u2019s guitarist Jonny Greenwood confirmed the hack, and said: \u201cInstead of complaining \u2013 much \u2013 or ignoring it, we\u2019re releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of Extinction Rebellion. Just for the next 18 days. So for \u00a318 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom. Never intended for public consumption (though some clips did reach the cassette in the OK Computer reissue) it\u2019s only tangentially interesting. And very, very long. Not a phone download.\u201d Thom Yorke wrote of the 1.8 gigabyte collection: \u201cIt\u2019s not v interesting. There\u2019s a lot of it \u2026 as it\u2019s out there it may as well be out there until we all get bored and move on.\u201d Extinction Rebellion thanked the band, describing its gift as \u201cunprecedented support\u201d. Radiohead authorised the use of their song Idioteque for a new Extinction Rebellion promotional video. \u201cThe climate and ecological emergency demands courage, truth-telling and generosity like never before,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe are so grateful to Radiohead for showing us how that\u2019s done, both now and in the lead-up to the April rebellion. Words are inadequate but actions do change the world.\u201d The hack was first discussed on a Radiohead page on website Reddit a week ago, where a user described being offered the files for sale. \u201cWe originally considered pooling our money together, as our enthusiasm over the rare opportunity to share material of such high historical interest for a band we love peaked, but were concerned about the ethics of the situation,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAccording to [the leaker], they got the whole 18 hours of material by trading some other rare/unreleased material for it.\u201d The files are a treasure trove for Radiohead fans. Along with demo versions of OK Computer tracks, they feature a full-band version of True Love Waits, a live favourite that was finally recorded in a piano arrangement for 2016 album A Moon Shaped Pool. Much praised on the Reddit forum is an alternate version of Lift, a song that was eventually included on the 20th anniversary reissue of OK Computer \u2013 the alternate version, at the 10-minute mark of the MD125 recording, features an anthemic arena rock arrangement. The collection opens with a version of Exit Music (For a Film) with alternate lyrics, including the line \u201cliving in a glass house\u201d, which later cropped up on Life in a Glasshouse on Amnesiac. Disc three meanwhile contains an 11-minute version of OK Computer\u2019s lead single Paranoid Android, while entirely unreleased songs include Attention and Hurts to Walk. There\u2019s also a brief snippet of Thom Yorke beatboxing. Fans have posted a document online that outlines the identity and likely provenance of each track."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
