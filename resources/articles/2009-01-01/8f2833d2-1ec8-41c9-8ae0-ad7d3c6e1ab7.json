What Fry failed to recognise was that Sunderland were bent on a similar experiment on Wearside that left this fourth-round tie largely devoid of life or purpose. Ricky Sbragia left Sunderland's three chief strikers dozing on the bench, pleading \"insufficient recovery time'' before a Premier League game at home to Fulham on Tuesday night. Against a Blackburn side that, under Sam Allardyce, keeps clean sheets on a routine basis anyway, the gamble predictably failed. What was the tiniest of fixture pile-ups, with four matches in 15 days, has now become more demanding with a replay at Ewood Park on 4 February It was only when Kenwyne Jones stirred himself midway through the second half, and summoned a lanky run or two, that Sunderland mustered any semblance of threat. Appropriately enough, Jones's appearance came soon after a woman in the crowd had shouted \"Come on Sunderland, wake up'', as if she had twigged the whole hibernation routine. Jones disrupted the left of Blackburn's defence sufficiently to set up Steed Malbranque, whose lazily executed shot sailed way too high. A goal would have been more than Sunderland deserved. Sbragia spent two years as a first-team coach under Allardyce at Bolton and any insights they might have shared led only to stalemate. As Sunderland's moves repeatedly faltered in midfield, Big Sam still felt very much in charge. Blackburn knocked Sunderland out of the Carling Cup and are now well placed to repeat it in the FA Cup. \"Defensively we are excellent at the moment,'' Allardyce said. \"The way we defend, if we had got one goal we would have probably gone on to win.'' And Allardyce felt that goal should have been secured before half-time, most gratingly when Roque Santa Cruz had a one-on-one against Martin Fulop, but failed to show the skills that have made him the chief transfer target of Britain's most stable bank: Manchester City. In a tedious first half, there were other Blackburn opportunities. Chris Samba, their excellent centre-back, jogged up to the near post to head an inswinging near-post corner from Vince Grella narrowly wide in the second minute, and in the last minute of the half, Pascal Chimbonda made a vital block when Morten Gamst Pedersen's 15-yard drive was heading for goal. Three minutes before half-time Phil Bardsley suffered a nose bleed, came off for treatment and returned with an unnumbered shirt. There were a few Sunderland players who would have envied him his anonymity. A radio reporter felt the need to jot down two phrases prepared in case something happened. The first said \"Blackburn have broken the deadlock.'' The second said \"Sunderland have broken the deadlock.'' Neither were needed. Blackburn also had late opportunities to win it. Santa Cruz had been replaced by Carlos Villanueva midway through the half and Villanueva had a chance to set up Benni McCarthy, only to pass to the goalkeeper instead. Pedersen failed to finish off a couple of fleeting half-chances. Allardyce's only dissatisfaction came from a tackle by Andy Reid in the closing minutes on Grella, which left him with stud marks below the knee and left Blackburn down to 10 men in second-half stoppage time. \"I see him as a key to our season.'' Allardyce said, \"and this was his first full start. The referee missed the studs.''"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
