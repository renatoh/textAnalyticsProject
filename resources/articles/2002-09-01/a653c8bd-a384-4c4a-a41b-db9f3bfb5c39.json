The Everton defender joins Derek McInnes and Dominic Matteo who have already been forced out of the Scottish party through injury, leaving the manager Berti Vogts with 20 of his original 25-strong party. But he said: \"I am happy with the players we have and confident we can take three points.\" To motivate the remaining players, Vogts is going to show them a video of edited excerpts of the 1-1 draw the last times the team met at the Toftir stadium. It was a poor performance capped by the dismissal of Matt Elliott. \"We know the Faroe islands will defend, defend and defend again but it is up to us to find the way through and I'm confident we can do that,\" Vogts said. Four employees of the Scottish FA were unable to travel yesterday after being removed from the plan due to the load being too heavy. With bad weather reports in the Faroes, more fuel was required in case the plane was forced to turn around and head back to Aberdeen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
