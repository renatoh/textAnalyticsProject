Then he grinned. \"But before you do, having picked up five points from the previous 15 games, that's six points from four undefeated since I arrived.\" It was a fair point, and given that Forest's first win since they beat the same team by the same score back on October 25 last year took them out of the relegation zone at the expense of bitter local rivals Derby County made it an almost perfect day for Kinnear, whose appointment in place of Paul Hart had been greeted with at best ambivalence and in some quarters downright hostility from the Forest faithful. They are right behind him now, having seen enough in his short spell in charge to realise that Kinnear is not after all the footballing barbarian of legend. The former Wimbledon manager has certainly made things a little simpler and encouraged a more direct approach, but he has not tried to change Forest's inclination to pass their way out of trouble. Their first goal was perfectly executed, with Andy Reid picking up the ball in his own half and exchanging passes with Marlon King and Nick Barmby as he ran on into the Bradford penalty area before sidefooting the ball past the goalkeeper Nico Vaesen. Bradford, their confidence raised by the previous week's win over Crewe, responded impressively, and the free-kick which Dean Windass curled past Barry Roche from 22 yards 10 minutes later was the least they deserved from a first-half performance of verve and intelligence. But the second period belonged almost exclusively to Forest. Ronnie Wallwork twice cleared shots off the line, King and Jason Gavin were sent off for a spectacular dust-up, before Reid put in yet another cross from the left and the ball looped off David Wetherall's outstretched foot for Taylor to head cleverly back across the wrong-footed Vaesen. Kinnear paid tribute to both Taylor, who played carrying an injury, and Barmby, brought in on a month's loan from Leeds, though the former England international struggled with the pace of the game. \"It's a monkey off our backs, of course it is, but now we've got to make the most of it by winning at Wimbledon and Gillingham,\" he said. Six points from those games would go a long way towards securing the club's First Division status, an objective that now looks beyond Bradford. At least the club's return to administration may be relatively short-lived, with a deal to satisfy creditors understood to be in the offing.
