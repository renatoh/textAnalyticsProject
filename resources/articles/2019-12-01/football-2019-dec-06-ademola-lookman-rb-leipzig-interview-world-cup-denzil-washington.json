Des and Felix coached him from the ages of 11 to 16, during an extended teeth-cutting process playing Sunday league football for Waterloo FC, and beyond that he has counted both as \u201cmentors\u201d for as long as he can remember. If uncertainty began to take root during those teenage years they would put him straight immediately, keeping his focus trained on the dream that had always consumed him. \u201cI wanted to be playing in an academy and, as time went on, I was thinking: \u2018Time\u2019s catching up, when\u2019s it going to happen?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d be like: \u2018Maybe it won\u2019t work out for me.\u2019 And they\u2019d quickly go: \u2018What are you talking about? God\u2019s given you this talent for a reason, don\u2019t ever give up on it.\u2019 \u201cThem reminding me what I have is always refreshing. Even if there\u2019s that second of doubt where you\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m not too sure\u2019, they\u2019re always like: \u2018No, no, no, we didn\u2019t start off [playing football] to doubt ourselves, we do it properly, we do it because we back ourselves no matter what the situation is.\u2019\u201d It is a sentiment that comes to mind now because this is not the easiest of times. Lookman has just come inside from an hour and a half\u2019s training with RB Leipzig and, make no mistake, he has looked the part out there. In an 11-a-side match crammed into two-thirds of a pitch and containing its fair share of hard knocks, he has scored a couple of sharp finishes and to the naked eye has responded well to Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s constant demands for \u201cintensit\u00e4t\u201d. But on a match day, when it really matters, Lookman has had only 201 minutes all season. Leipzig, a point off the Bundesliga summit, are flying but on a personal level the move he sought for more than a year has yet to catch light. \u201cThis time around it\u2019s definitely different,\u201d says Lookman, whose loan from Everton in the second half of 2017-18 brought five goals, a series of sparkling performances and a clamour for his return. \u201cThe first time it was like a leap of faith, but this time it\u2019s more like \u2018go\u2019 time. The club has changed, the team is stronger \u2013 a lot stronger \u2013 and there\u2019s a new coach, so it\u2019s something I have to adapt to.\u201d It was, he says, a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to come back in July when the clubs finally agreed a fee. Last season it had been hard, initially, to get over the disappointment when Everton rejected two offers. \u201cAt the beginning it was,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then thinking of that was hurting me. If I was thinking, \u2018I wish I was there\u2019 then I\u2019d be like, \u2018How\u2019s that going to help my situation now?\u2019\u201d He knuckled down and received some reassurances from Marco Silva but a breakthrough never really came. Only three starts in the league ensued and he admits it was hard, at times, to wonder what was going wrong when those ahead of him were hardly firing on all cylinders. That was another situation in which Des and Felix, who stopped him going \u201coff-topic\u201d, proved invaluable. Their advice appears to work because Lookman, for all the stop-start nature of his career to date, hardly seems low on confidence. He talks fondly and at length about Waterloo, a club set up two decades ago to provide a supportive and inclusive community for youngsters in disadvantaged parts of Lambeth and Southwark, but in the same breath as recalling the leaf-strewn, bobbly, sloped pitch of his youth he is unhesitant in stating: \u201cThis is my stage now.\u201d The players who came through at Waterloo were \u201ca bunch of brothers\u201d, he remembers. \u201cWe were a top team. Dead serious. All should be playing at a top level; all 16 of us, including the subs, were good enough. Some of them are now in uni or working and some of them are playing football part-time.\u201d He was picked up by Charlton after a trial game in 2013, reaching the first team within a little over two years. Looking back he wonders whether his truncated formal football education has held him back in some way. \u201cYes and no. There are some things I\u2019d love to have learned. Tactically there are things I\u2019m not too sure about and I\u2019d definitely have learned that inside an academy. But there was never a time when I wasn\u2019t getting coached. I was playing with my friends and that was cool.\u201d Much of Lookman\u2019s conversation is lighthearted, peppered with little asides that underscore his confidence in things coming good. Nagelsmann, the prodigious 32-year-old coach, has told him \u201cto play with freedom\u201d and encouraged him to back his ability. \u201cIf I have to think about what I\u2019m going to do I don\u2019t do it well,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m instinctive I do things off the cuff and it just comes naturally.\u201d There is some thinking to do, though, where his international future is concerned. A senior England call looks far off, even though he seemed primed for that when he shone in the Under-20 World Cup win two years ago, and Nigeria \u2013 his parents\u2019 homeland \u2013 remains an option. The England setup keep in occasional contact but he knows he has \u201ca serious decision\u201d to make with the 2022 World Cup in mind. \u201cI\u2019ve not changed my mind [on wanting to represent England] but I\u2019m open and it\u2019s good to have different opportunities,\u201d he says. In three years\u2019 time he will be \u201cnot at my peak but good, very good\u201d \u2013 that self-belief again \u2013 and it is something he wants to demonstrate in Qatar. By then he will hope to have proved his worth at Leipzig. Life under Nagelsmann has meant adapting to a possession-based style that informed onlookers say is as complex as any they have seen. After a long pause he agrees he has never quite worked in conditions like these but the winter break is coming and the expectation is he will receive far more game time from January. During those weeks off he will develop himself off the pitch too: when he is alone in his apartment he reads assiduously and enjoys watching speeches and lectures by people who inspire him, with Denzel Washington a current favourite. \u201cI just like to learn about different people,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if I watch something 10 times, every time I\u2019ll learn something different, take it and use it.\u201d The relative quiet of Leipzig sits well with Lookman. Despite the frustration of the last five months he is certain he is in the right place, even if young English players have not always taken easily to a continental setting. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s happened,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in my case it was successful first time, and this time it will be even more successful.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
