And every year, some of the best sporting moments of the preceding 12 months are criminally forgotten. Well, not any more. Guardian Unlimited Sport has compiled a shortlist for the Alternative Sports Personality of the Year to be voted on by you. Last year you set the agenda by clamouring for Paula Radcliffe, who this year won the Beeb's biggest, shiniest gong. The format is the same. All you have to do is email the sports.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk with the name of your choice from the short-list below in the subject heading. By way of enticement, we'll even put all voters' names into a draw for a booty of sporting books which have made their way into the office over the past year. Graeme Dott Does the name ring any bells? In February Dott was fined two frames in his first round match against Welshman Darren Morgan at the China Open in Shanghai for over-sleeping and arriving late, despite having set two alarm clocks. After eventually losing the match 5-3, Dott said he felt 'suicidal'. That might sound like an overreaction unless you know the sequence of events that led up to the match. Dott's remarkable chain reaction of bad luck began when a blizzard delayed his flight from Glasgow to Heathrow. He then missed his London to Bangkok flight by a mere 10 minutes and had to wait 10 hours for the next one. When he arrived in Thailand there was a further 10-hour wait for the connection to Shanghai. Severely jet-lagged after a 41-hour journey, he decided to catch 40 winks to freshen up before the match. The alarms rang, as did his phone, but nothing could rouse the Scot until panicked officials got into his room 20 minutes before the scheduled start of the match. With hardly time to change let alone wash, he jumped in a taxi which promptly took him to the wrong venue. After a mad sprint, the 24-year-old arrived at the Shanghai Intenational Gymnastics Stadium where he discovered that he had been docked two frames for arriving 20 minutes late. 'I just can't believe what's happened. This is a total nightmare,' said Dott after his China crisis. 'My head was spinning every time I got down over a shot. I didn't have time to brush my teeth or have a shave and for the first couple of frames I didn't have any underpants on!' H'Angus the Monkey As football mascots go, Stuart Drummond, aka H'Angus, is fairly well known. He has twice been thrown out of away games for simulating sex - once with a female steward at Scunthorpe in 2000, and last year with an inflatable doll at Blackpool. So who better than to be the elected mayor of Hartlepool in May, eh? Well probably plenty, but not the candidates from the country's major political parties who were beaten to the \u00a353,000-a-year job by a juvenile joker in a monkey suit with the manifesto motto, 'Free bananas for school children!'? Despite the embarrassment, Downing Street insisted that elected mayors were 'the way forward'. They added: 'It is only to be expected that new faces come to the fore.' Even if they are made out of fake fur. Marie Reine Le Gougne As Errol Brown once sang, \"Everyone's a winner baby, that's the truth.\" And the IOC seemed to be in full agreement at the Winter Olympics earlier this year because they decided to diffuse the 'Skategate' scandal that rocked Salt Lake City by awarding a second set of figure skating gold medals to Canadian pair Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. The controversy erupted after it was discovered that pressure had been put on the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne to tip the vote for gold 5-4 in favour of the Russian couple Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze whose performance did not match that of the Canadians. With the other judges' votes arranged along traditional lines (with Eastern Bloc countries lined up against those of the West) Didier Gailhaguet, the head of the French Olympic team, candidly admitted that Le Gougne's voting hand had been forced. \"Some people close to her have acted badly and have put someone who is honest and upright, but emotionally fragile, under pressure,\" said Gailhaguet, himself skating on thin ice. \"I think she has been somewhat manipulated.\" The result? \"The executive board has followed the International Skating Union proposal to award two gold medals and the votes of the French judge have been cancelled, making the final result four votes all,\" said an IOC source. So is Marie worth your vote for causing perhaps the biggest ruckus of the sporting year? Use your better judgment. George Best The front-page obituaries are ready to go just as soon as George Best does. But, despite all the false-alarms, Best, arguably the best footballer ever, is still alive and kicking thanks to a liver transplant this summer. After watching him turn deeper shades of yellow over the past year, regular viewers of Sky Sport's Gillette Soccer Saturday know that this is now the Best the man can get. The country's first superstar footballer, Best retired to a life of alcohol and indulgence at the tender age of 26. 'I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered,' he famously said of his lifestyle. After a drinking binge that spanned three decades, he was finally given his last orders in 2000. He even had implants put in his stomach designed to cause a violent reaction to drink. But only since the liver transplant has he truly managed to stay teetotal. George Ochieng and Arthur Kamu It's all too familiar a story: two innocent black lads, pulled over by the police. They were just cycling down the street in Bolton, minding their own business, except that the 'street' was the M61. Both were members of Kenya's Commonwealth Games cycling team on a training session, blissfully unaware that it's against the law to ride anything with an engine size under 50cc on British motorways. They were stopped doing 40mph on the hard shoulder, 17 miles away from the Athletes Village. 'I could not quite believe my eyes,' said Inspector Chris Burrows. 'Obviously it is a very unusual incident , but also a very serious one. They were dressed in full training kit and did not have a care in the world.' The Kenyan team were almost disqualified from competing in the Games. Not because they broke the Highway Code, but because their equipment was not up to competition standard. Luckily, Manchester-based cycling store Harry Hall Cycles rescued them with a supply of free bikes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
