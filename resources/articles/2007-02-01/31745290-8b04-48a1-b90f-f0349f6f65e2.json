One of the most extraordinary characteristics of Iranian leaders and officials, especially at the foreign ministry in Tehran, is to put more of the blame on Britain than America. As if in a time warp, the Iranians are convinced that Britain continues to meddle in Central Asia today just at it has for the last 200 years, and that the Washington is following London's lead rather than the other way round. I have little time for conspiracy theories, but the Iranians could be partly right - not about the exaggerated role of Britain, but about the role of the US and Britain in the current unrest. While it would be a step too far to suggest that the US and Britain were behind the explosion, they do have a vested interest in encouraging instability within Iran. I had a conversation with a British official in London last year about the nuclear stand-off. I suggested there was not much chance of stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability. He disagreed, not because he thought the negotiations between Britain, France, Germany and Iran would work. Instead, he hinted there were other ways of putting the frighteners on Tehran, of which the main one was to encourage Iran's restive ethnic minorities. Iran is far from being a homogenous state, and the leadership in Tehran is fearful of unrest. Persians only make up 51% of the population. Azeris, some of whom have been pushing to break away, make up 24% of the population. The Kurds, many of whom look at Iraqi Kurdistan and dream again of an independent Kurdish nation, account for 7%. Arabs, in the economically and strategically sensitive southwest, make up 3% of the population. And there are a host of others, including Baluchi, populous in the province where the bombings took place, who make up 2% of the population. The extent of the unrest is hard for Western reporters to substantiate. Getting a visa for Tehran can be hard enough. Once there, getting permission to visit some of these areas is extremely rare. If the US and Britain wanted to send a signal to Tehran to stop messing around in Iraq and to consider backing down over the nuclear plans, stirring up trouble among Iran's ethnic minorities is relatively cost free. Not to mention deniable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
