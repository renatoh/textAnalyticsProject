I studied Hamlet at A-level and even remember some of the soliloquies, but I have never read or seen Twelfth Night or any of the history plays. I can't bear to admit to anyone my terrible gap, and I nod knowingly as friends and acquaintances talk about Richard III, Henry V, Orsino and Viola. Similarly, I learned enough Latin to understand the Pater Noster, but when I can't decipher some of the Latin legends engraved in monuments from Londinium to Roma, I plead myopia. But it is philosophy I most regret having missed. Somehow, I suspect, if I had mastered Socrates and Spinoza, Kant and Kierkegaard, I would have led a more satisfying life. Listening to the Today programme over the past few days I realised that I'm not alone in attributing life-changing properties to philosophy. Asked to name the one subject which should be introduced to the national curriculum, Today listeners overwhelmingly chose the discipline that includes Socratic dialogues, Kantian metaphysics and Derrida's post-structuralism. Do we really think a 12-year-old would learn a great deal from Plato's system of aesthetics, or Kant's categorical imperative? Having done an introductory course to philosophy when I was 13, I am doubtful. Like sex, philosophy sampled too early risks becoming mechanical, overladen with truth-stretching anecdotes and ultimately disappointing. By the end of my course (smuggled into our Catholic school under the fig leaf of religious studies), I had learned about Aristotle's tutoring of Alexander the Great, in which he taught the young general the importance of the 'golden mean'; about Pascal's wager regarding God's existence; and Kant's constitutionals under the linden trees, after a hefty German burgher's lunch. This pastiche of thoughts and anecdotes coloured my lessons but did not shape my thinking; at 13 you want to seize the day, not contemplate how best to approach what it brings. Despite this early setback I remained convinced that at some point I should read Socrates and Co: through them, I was sure, I would learn the secret of existence. I approached the philosophers and popularisers of philosophy I met with awe: from John Lucas through Alain de Botton, from Anthony Grayling to Mary Warnock, I peered at them hopefully, certain that they held the keys to life, and if only I could draw closer, they'd hand them over. It's a belief that has survived the challenge posed by science and scientists. Science may perfectly explain the material world around us, but scientists explorations stop short of the metaphysical, and their preoccupations engage our heads but not our hearts and spirit. No matter how riveting black holes may be, or how pertinent Darwinian selection, scientific quests fail to fire the popular imagination in the way that the philosopher's 'what is the good life?' continues to do. We shouldn't be exposed to philosophy too early. It is too heady a mixture, too bewitching a proposition for a schoolchild to deal with. University is soon enough; once you're there, let the great adventure begin. The Nancy factor As Tony Blair back-pedals furiously from his 'special relationship' with George Bush's America, Britain's ties with another nation are being strengthened. Italy, land of Berlusconi and bandanas, is reviving the ties of Anglo-Italian friendship that have long inspired writers such as Byron, Forster and Mortimer. While North American investment in the UK continues to decline, Italian investment accounted for some \u00a312 billion and 51,362 jobs in 2003 and is certain to have increased by the time 2004 figures are published. Next month, the new ambassador, Giancarlo Aragona and his (appropriately) English wife Sandra, are launching 'Made in Italy', a festival of fashion, interior design, music and food at Harrods. He has been taken aback by media interest in his 6 September drinks party. He put it down to the presence of such fashionable Italians as Donatella Versace and Gianluca Vialli. A member of the embassy's PR department soon put him right: the reason that Hello! and others have already started getting their paparazzi ready is that Nancy Dell'Olio is scheduled to come - new boyfriend in tow. Blind man's bluff David Blunkett's many supporters describe him as a politician whose intellect, drive and extraordinary perseverance will lead him straight to Number 10. He is, they claim, a Machiavellian genius capable of perpetrating extraordinary deceit in order to further his political ambitions. At a dinner a few years ago, one tabloid executive began putting it about that the Home Secretary was not blind at all, but had chosen to take on the role of the disabled minister in order to win sympathy votes. The New Statesman editor, Peter Wilby, found himself seated beside the Home Secretary (at that time, Secretary of State for Education). As the dinner grew more and more animated, a fellow guest told Wilby about the tabloid editor's thesis. My boss thought this suspicion should be immediately shared with the one person who could speak with true authority on the matter. Turning to Blunkett, he bellowed: 'That woman from [whatever] newspaper says you're not really blind.' Blunkett hit the floor with his white stick. 'Stupid woman. Does she really think if I weren't blind I'd want to walk around with this frigging stick? Or [here he nodded at the dog beside him] with this frigging dog?' \u00b7 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
