The federal government\u2019s budget announcement says the Immigration Department has reached an agreement with the states and territories to radically alter the way services are provided in immigration detention in mainland centres. \u201cThe Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) has negotiated arrangements with a number of state and territory governments for the provision of various services (including health, education, corrections and policing services) to immigration detention facilities and people in immigration detention.\u201d It is unclear whether this would mean the federal government was moving away from privatisation, or whether the states would be free to subsequently privatise services. Previously, management of Australia\u2019s onshore detention centres was contracted to the private contractor Serco, but the company\u2019s contract is due to expire in July. International Health and Medical Services, which provides healthcare in detention centres, is also due to expire soon. In a budget release, the immigration minister also said that by curbing the number of asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat, the government is projected to save $2.5bn over five years. Despite this the Commission of Audit highlighted that Australia\u2019s detention program, targeted mainly at asylum seekers who arrive by boat, was likely to cost $10bn over the forward estimates. Last Friday the immigration minister announced the merging of customs and immigration border operations into a new agency called the Australian Border Force, as part of the cost saving measures. Immigration staff across a range of areas \u2013 including immigration compliance, detention services and customs strategy \u2013 would be taken into the new agency. The minister claims that savings made by \u201cstopping the boats\u201d will allow for an expansion of the special humanitarian program for refugees. 20,000 extra places on this program will be created. \u201cIn 2014-15, Australia will welcome 13,750 people through our humanitarian program and [it] remains one of the top three refugee resettlement countries in the world,\u201d the minister said. The government had previously cut the humanitarian intake from 20,000 under the ALP government. A growth in skilled migration has also been forecast by pledging to allocate nearly 68% of Australia\u2019s \u201cmigration places\u201d to this sector and prioritising employer-sponsored visas. \u201cThe 2014-15 migration program provides a total of 190,000 places, including 128,550 for skilled migration, 60,885 places for family migration and 565 places for migration under the special eligibility stream,\u201d the minister said. The budget announcement also flags a major funding boost for Indonesia, with additional funding of $86.8m over three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
