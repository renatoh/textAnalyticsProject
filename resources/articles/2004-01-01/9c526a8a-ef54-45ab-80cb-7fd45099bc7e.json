Spots bargain striker: \"\u00a315 ono. Buyer must collect from North Liverpool area. If you're not here by the evening, he's going in the skip.\" 11.01am Stopping only to draw a tenner from the cashpoint, McClaren jumps in his car and bombs down the A1(M). \"He's someone we are definitely interested in and we are speaking with Liverpool,\" he guffaws cluelessly as he drives. 2pm McClaren arrives at Anfield. Mr Em is outside. He is covered by heavy tarpaulin. 2.01pm McClaren tries to fix Mr Em to his roof rack. There is not enough rope. 2.23pm McClaren bundles Mr Em into the back of his boot. However, the lid won't close properly and bounces up and down on Em's confused skull as the car moves along. 2.45pm McClaren rents van and loads Mr Em into the back of it. In what some would consider a totally unnecessary move, he straps Em to the side to stop him moving about. Goes off to look for blankets to cover Em so he doesn't get damaged in transit. 3pm McClaren comes back with a big woollen blanket only to find the straps broken and the back of the van empty. Eventually finds Mr Em cowering under tarpaulin. 3.01pm Ged comes rushing out of Anfield's front door. Someone asks him if Mr Em really is going. \"No,\" he snaps. \"Don't expect anyone to leave, don't expect anyone to come. Can I repeat? Nobody is going to leave, nobody is going to come.\" 3.02pm McClaren goes away. 3.03pm Ged goes in. 4.58pm Mr Em decides he likes it under the tarpaulin. It is nice, nobody can see you, and there are no scary footballs bouncing around to hit you on the shin which hurts and makes you look bad. Mr Em wants to stay under the tarpaulin. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Come on, let's get women to play in different and more feminine garb than the men, in tighter shorts for example. In volleyball women wear different clothes from the men. Beautiful women play football nowadays, excuse me for saying so\" - Sepp Blatter takes the Fiver's official Fifa anthem Sepp's Gonna Sexx Ya Up a bit too literally. WHY IF IT'S NOT THE SECOND 'DO-IT-YOURSELF FIVER STORY' SERIES THIS WEEK!!! Here are the constituent parts of a story about Giovanni Trapattoni that the Fiver had neither the time nor creative juice to turn into three cack-handed paragraphs. Can you piece it together in less time than it takes The Man to yank hard on the piece of string attached to the Fiver's front tail? Try. most successful Italian coach of modern era; Spurs; Spurs?; eh?; EH?!?; \u00a31.2m a year; ah; E' Stanah; English lessons, practice with Claudio Ranieri; can't help; more talks in Italy; today; verbal agreement thrashed out, joins after Euro 2004; nothing signed; but nothing can go wrong; may even be sooner; Italian FA restless and holding big sharp knife; Gianluca Vialli may take over; really; but no quotes; none at all; nothing more than speculation; never stopped Fiver before; but wait, it's Trap!; \"every year, around about this time, the whispering starts\"; Fiver washes hands furiously; \"but there isn't a shadow of a doubt; I'd like to remain with the Italian Football Federation\"; so who's telling the truth?; and more importantly, it's Friday and it's knocking on, so who in all honesty really cares?; be honest; we deserve that at least THE RUMOUR MILL Aston Villa are taking Nacional's Freddy Grisales on a week's trial in the hope of him turning out to be a decent midfielder.
