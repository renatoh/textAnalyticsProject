The Arsenal manager moved decisively while he was in Brazil working as a World Cup TV pundit to close a \u00a330m deal for S\u00e1nchez from Barcelona. The Chile forward has been Arsenal\u2019s player of the season so far, scoring 14 goals in all competitions and making light of any settling-in difficulties. However, Wenger said that Liverpool had also been on the case, as they prepared for life after the Barcelona-bound Luis Su\u00e1rez who, coincidentally, had been an Arsenal target the previous summer. Wenger was worried that the Merseyside club might have had the bargaining power. \u201cI thought Liverpool was a serious candidate [for S\u00e1nchez] because they had Su\u00e1rez going there [to Barcelona] so you think that\u2019s an easy way to do the deal,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the player always has the decision. \u201cWas I worried that Liverpool might get S\u00e1nchez? Yes. It could happen. There were some other clubs that were in for him as well. The fact is the transfers at that level today always take time to get every detail right so, because it takes time, you think always that somebody else can come in \u2013 [like] Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern [Munich] \u2013 to do the deal.\u201d If things had worked out differently in the summer of last year, Su\u00e1rez might have been lining up for Arsenal against Liverpool and who knows where S\u00e1nchez would have been. Liverpool, though, refused to budge in the face of Arsenal\u2019s infamous \u00a340,000,001 offer. Wenger said that he was happy with how things had worked out in the end, although it would have been a surprise if he had said anything else. \u201cThe history of every big club is made up of many big players that you missed,\u201d Wenger added. \u201cIt goes on and sometimes you get another one. I wanted to play Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka together. Maybe, if Anelka had stayed [in 1999], Henry would not have become the player he became. Sometimes, it\u2019s coincidence that decides your destiny.\u201d Sometimes, it is sheer hard work. Wenger made headlines around the world last summer when he was pictured throwing himself into diving headers on Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro but it was not all fun and games for him at the World Cup. He was networking behind the scenes and he said that he had met with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s agent a \u201cfew times\u201d. Wenger had followed S\u00e1nchez since the player\u2019s days at Udinese and his sales pitch took in how he would fit easily into Arsenal\u2019s style, develop at the club and play regularly, which \u2013 to great frustration \u2013 had not been the case at Barcelona. Above all, Arsenal could offer him regular Champions League football. S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, liked the idea of working with Wenger, of playing with Mesut \u00d6zil and of living in London. The transfer was concluded relatively quickly after Chile\u2019s last-16 World Cup exit against Brazil on 28 June. \u201cS\u00e1nchez came out from a period where he maybe didn\u2019t have the number of games that he wanted at Barcelona,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI just tried, like every manager, to convince the player that you can help him to develop the quality of his game and that the way we play football would suit him. \u201cAs well, we have continuity. All the players want to play in the Champions League \u2013 it is quite simple. And we have quite a good continuity on that front. At the end of the day, every great player has a choice to go where he wants today. He has chosen us and we are very happy for that.\u201d Wenger described S\u00e1nchez as being \u201cmade for the English game\u201d because of his \u201cinstinctive and tough\u201d style and he said that he could see the similarities with Su\u00e1rez. \u201cThey are South Americans, they are provoking players, they go with the ball,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThey are very determined as well, both of them. They have plenty of similar attitudes.\u201d S\u00e1nchez\u2019s stamina has stood up admirably to the rigours of English football and Wenger\u2019s reluctance, despite the best of intentions, to take him out of the firing line. Wenger did leave him in London for the club\u2019s final Champions League group tie at Galatasaray on the Tuesday before last while S\u00e1nchez was an unused substitute at Aston Villa in September and only a second-half substitute against Tottenham Hotspur later that same month. However, the statistics show that he has started 22 of Arsenal\u2019s 25 games in all competitions this season, together with six friendlies for Chile, which have been played in North and South America. Two weeks ago, Wenger was worried about S\u00e1nchez being in the \u201cred zone\u201d and, with the hectic Christmas and New Year programme looming, he is fearful that the 26-year-old might suffer. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock to the system for everybody who is not used to it,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cYou have to say: \u2018Be careful. In England, there\u2019s no stop in winter.\u2019 Many of them suffer physically.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
