In an election rally in Telford, Shropshire, eight miles from where he grew up, Corbyn said a Labour majority government would \u201cchase down\u201d those who attempt a \u201cclever wheeze\u201d with their tax. His comments come after Boris Johnson said in the Telegraph that Corbyn would slap new taxes on people of all income levels \u2013 not just billionaires \u2013 and that the party \u201cviscerally detests\u201d those who have a profit motive. Corbyn said: \u201cMy personal views on billionaires is that they\u2019ve obviously got a great deal of money therefore they\u2019re in a very strong position to pay a lot more tax. \u201cSo our tax plans will affect the richest 5% of our society. We will be chasing down tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax havens because at the end of the day if you\u2019re doing some very clever wheeze, which somehow or other is avoiding your levels of taxation, you should be paying. Go further away [and] what happens then? You\u2019ve got an underfunded school, hospital and public services as a whole.\u201d The Labour leader was cheered with chants of: \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d as he spoke to activists and campaigners at the University of Wolverhampton\u2019s Telford campus after introducing their candidate in the Tory-Labour marginal seat, currently held by Conservative Lucy Allan. He added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a moral obligation to pay your taxes. However rich, powerful and famous you are, one day you might have a heart attack. Then you\u2019re going to need the public services.\u201d He also criticised Tory comments on Grenfell Tower victims not using common sense to escape the fatal fire as \u201cshameful\u201d. \u201cThey shamefully seem to think the victims of the Grenfell fire died because they didn\u2019t have the common sense to save themselves. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s common sense: don\u2019t put flammable cladding on people\u2019s homes. That\u2019s common sense.\u201d Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has apologised after saying on a radio show that: \u201cI think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do.\u201d Fellow Tory Andrew Bridgen also had to apologise after defending him. Corbyn also said: \u201cDon\u2019t close fire stations and don\u2019t cut firefighters. That\u2019s common sense. And don\u2019t ignore residents when they tell you their home is a death trap.\u201d Corbyn used his speech to say he would be a \u201cvery different\u201d kind of prime minister should he be elected. He said he did not believe he was \u201cborn to rule\u201d but would share power out to everyone who helped build the Labour movement. The Labour leader grew up in a village just eight miles from where he delivered his speech, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here in Telford. I feel like I\u2019m at home.\u201d Labour\u2019s candidate for the seat, Katrina Gilman, spoke before Corbyn took to the platform and focused on future A&amp;E services in the town, which she claimed were being downgraded, and the closure of a women and children\u2019s centre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
