The Labour peer Andrew Adonis tweeted that it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d for Tesco to accept the business rates holiday worth \u00a3585m and said the retailer should \u201cpay it back\u201d if it could afford to pay a big dividend to shareholders. However, Tesco\u2019s chairman, John Allan, told the Guardian that rewarding shareholders was the \u201cright thing\u201d to do after they backed it through the five-year recovery from an accounting scandal. The company\u2019s final dividend payment is worth \u00a3635m \u2013 making the total payout to shareholders about \u00a3900m in the year to 29 February \u2013 and came after a year in which it banked a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.3bn. \u201cI firmly believe that we have done the right thing,\u201d said Allan. \u201cThe right thing to do in these circumstances was to honour the pledge made to shareholders, particularly given that we have already made considerable efforts to look after our staff.\u201d Tesco has 50,000 employees off sick on full pay, while hourly paid workers in its stores and distribution centres will receive a 10% bonus for time worked in April and May. Tesco was not accepting any other government support, such as deferring VAT, and would not \u201cdip into\u201d any of the government loan schemes available, Allan said. It also had not \u201ctaken a penny\u201d from the the taxpayer-backed wage support scheme despite having so many employees off sick, he said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for business rates relief, but it is being granted.\u201d It flagged other expenses, such as the plastic shields installed at checkouts in thousands of its stores to protect staff, as well as large quantities of other safety gear, including gloves and hand sanitiser. Taken together, its UK running costs could increase by \u00a3650m to \u00a3925m, the group said. Without the prospect of the tax break, Allan said it might not have been able to adopt the measures it had to safeguard employees and customers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything that has compromised our commitment to any of our other stakeholders \u2013 our employees and our customers \u2013 but also our shareholders who fund the business. We think they all deserve fair treatment,\u201d he said. The pandemic has brought mixed blessings for food retailers. Tesco said sales jumped 30% in the first few weeks of the coronavirus outbreak as shoppers stockpiled before the lockdown. But it now faced extra running costs after it was forced to hire 45,000 new staff to keep its stores and distribution centres running. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket group said the full financial impact of the crisis on its finances this year was \u201cimpossible to predict\u201d, with the need to employ extra staff for the duration of the crisis increasing its wage bill by\u00a3415m to \u00a3580m, depending on the length of the government-imposed lockdown. \u201cThe 45,000 extra colleagues that we have recruited is transferring a huge amounts of money to the general public and off the public purse,\u201d Allan said. Dave Lewis, the chief executive, said the retailer had to adapt quickly as the extraordinary increase in demand put pressure on stores and the whole food supply chain. \u201cUnderstandably, people were worried and we saw panic buying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a sales uplift of around 30% as people began to stockpile, which then began to tail off as the UK moved into a lockdown.\u201d Tesco said affluent shoppers had bought the most \u2013 10% of its customers accounted for almost a third of the extra sales, with stores in London experiencing the biggest sales increase. In the busiest week, the retailer sold double the usual amount of baked beans and chopped tomatoes \u2013 6m tins and 3.3m respectively. Toilet roll sales were up 75%, while sales of liquid soap quadrupled. Britons made almost 80m extra grocery shopping trips in March, spending almost \u00a32bn more on food and drink than in 2019 and setting an industry record for monthly grocery sales. However, while sales of groceries rocketed, Tesco said demand in other parts of its business had collapsed, with clothing and fuel sales down by 70%. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco was facing huge extra costs associated with carrying out a \u201cpublic service\u201d. \u201cI think they have gone out of their way to ensure people have been fed. It could have hunkered down and run the business for shareholders,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
