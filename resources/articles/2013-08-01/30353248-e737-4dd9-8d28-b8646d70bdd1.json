Click here to watch \"I think of the building as an ode to the circle,\" says Francine Houben, founder and director of Dutch architecture practice Mecanoo, as she stands on the circular balcony at the top of a vertiginous book rotunda, beneath hoop-shaped light fittings, looking out through a screen of interlocking metal rings, as light washes down from the round window above. It's hard to escape the circle in Birmingham's new \u00a3189m library, due to open on Tuesday next week, which towers 10 storeys above Centenary Square as a gigantic stack of boxes, wrapped in a filigree skin of metal loops. \"We see the circle as a motif of the city,\" says Houben. \"The facade recalls the industrial gasometers as well the history of the jewellery trade here.\" Mecanoo joins a throng of architects who have recently used Birmingham's bijou heritage as an excuse to add a bit of bling. Both the sequin-studded blob of Future Systems' Selfridges store and the disastrous latticework box of Make's luxury mixed-use Cube show that \"jewel-like\" is not a phrase applied easily to big buildings. Nor does the emerging silvery slug of New Street Station, by Foreign Office Architects, look to fare much better. On a cloudy day, the library's oversized chain-mail looms menacingly above the square like a heavy suit of armour, or \u2013 as one passerby puts it \u2013 a big pair of lacy pants. Ten years in the making, it is a strange time for the biggest civic library in Europe to be opening, after swingeing national cuts saw more than 200 local libraries close their doors last year. And it seems particularly odd here, given that Birmingham's vast Central Library, built less than 40 years ago, stands just a few hundred metres away. The work of celebrated local architect John Madin, the Central Library has been loved and hated in equal measure since it opened in 1974. A bold inverted ziggurat of floating concrete planes, enclosing a world of open-plan floors linked by zigzagging escalators, it was greeted with rapture by the architectural press. \"One glides through the succession of volumes smoothly, sleekly,\" declared the Architects' Journal when the library was unveiled. \"The impression is of one space flowing into the next within the depth of the huge structure, an experience rare in this age.\" But it was dismissed by Prince Charles, with equal passion, as looking more like a place to incinerate books than keep them. Despite a long-fought campaign by English Heritage and the 20th Century Society, the library will soon face the wrecking ball, to be replaced by a generic development of shops and offices. \"The old building did a great job,\" says the council's library services assistant director, Brian Gambles. \"But its time expired. It was a very tired building and not one that's suitable for delivering a learning and cultural experience in the 21st century.\" The new library is linked by a generous open foyer to the neighbouring Repertory Theatre, also refurbished as part of the project, and there are plans for performances to spill into the library, with a sunken amphitheatre in the square intended to lure people inside. Ascending through the glistening layers of the new building, it seems that a library of the 21st century follows a similar model to Madin's scheme, but at a much bigger scale. Expansive open-plan floors are once again linked with weaving flights of escalators, only here they are suspended precipitously through dramatic interlocking rotundas, which climb from the cavernous lending library terraces, up through floating rings of bookshelves, to the heavenly reaches of the light-flooded atrium above. It is a finely-tuned sequence of level changes and alluring glimpses, more familiar to the world of shopping malls and airport terminals than a repository of knowledge. \"We don't know what the future of the library will be,\" says Houben, \"so we have designed space for change, to last over the next 100 years.\" With up to 10,000 visitors a day expected, the floors are designed with copious spaces for studying, meeting, working and gossiping on the usual range of soft seating, tables and perches. While the old library could be dingy in places, the floors of the new building are washed with daylight, with a continuous line of desks around the floor-to-ceiling windows. In fact the only thing missing from these bright, light, interconnected floors are cosy reading rooms \u2013 somewhere removed from the endless through-traffic of visitors pouring up the rotunda. One place to which many will no doubt flock are the outdoor terraces, created by the set-back form of the building, where readers can escape to sit among winding flowerbeds planted with edible fruit \u2013 from apple trees to raspberry bushes \u2013 and look out across the city to the rolling hills beyond. It is a view best observed from the very top of the building, designed as a golden crown intended to stand as an inspiring beacon, visible from all the local libraries around Birmingham. But its gleaming presence might not be quite so well received there, given that their budgets and opening hours have been cut just as this brassy behemoth opens its doors. In a surreal climax at the summit, this golden pod is also home to the Shakespeare Memorial Room, an interior reconstructed from Birmingham's original Victorian library and filled with copies of artefacts from the archive of the Brummie bard. As a ghostly relic from the building that was needlessly bulldozed to make way for the 1970s library, itself now to be swept away, it is a pointed reminder that one day, given Birmingham council's lust for demolition, this building's turn will also come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
