I found that in my time there I would try to control my environment more. For example, we have lab space there and I would obsessively clean it, and I am doing the same thing now, stuck in my apartment.\u201d Dierickx, 29, also becomes very attentive to change. \u201cThings like plants that grow noticeably or changing the decor of your room. It\u2019s a good way to channel energy,\u201d she says. \u201cNurturing our environment can only help our psychological balance.\u201d Sleeping at the station is not easy \u2013 when it is the polar summer it is light 24 hours a day. \u201cSleep is terrible, not just because of the light, but because it\u2019s high altitude. You\u2019re at 3,000 metres altitude, there\u2019s only 70% oxygen. People will routinely have nosebleeds every morning. The combination of those things makes getting rest very challenging, and that makes everything else more challenging.\u201d She says the key is to force yourself to sleep at set times. She also recommends board games and escapist books. Avoid War and Peace, and stick to thrillers. How does she find living in such close proximity to a small group of people? \u201cThat is one of the main challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially if there is someone you don\u2019t get along with. I\u2019ve found that I have to proactively use my good side, try to repair relationships and work on my generosity. I confront people with kindness.\u201d Ryan Ramsey, submarine captain Ramsey captained the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Turbulent from 2008-11. \u201cSubmariners are trained to deal with isolation, whereas the public aren\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the general public, it\u2019s a wicked problem that they\u2019re trying to tame. \u201cThe first thing to do is get into a routine. It needs discipline. Do the same things in the same order every day. Make the weekends different. You have to differentiate time.\u201d Ramsey suggests limiting your exposure to TV news. \u201cThe constant news is such a dynamic change at the moment and it\u2019s all negative,\u201d he says. \u201cPicking it up once a day will give you time to do other stuff.\u201d He also stresses the importance of exercise. \u201cIf you are healthy physically, you will be healthy mentally. I used to exercise with dumbbells in my cabin, which was tiny. And keep mentally fit as well. It\u2019s about reading books and doing something different. This is an ideal opportunity to learn something new.\u201d He describes a submarine as \u201ca steel tube with 130 people in it\u201d and admits there can be friction on a long deployment. \u201cDe-conflict early,\u201d he says. \u201cHave a chat; find out what the issues are.\u201d His final piece of advice is to \u201cenjoy what\u2019s there\u201d. Focus on what you have got rather than what you are being denied. \u201cTry to stay off the topic of what happens next,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can only control what you can control.\u201d Christopher Jamison, monk Jamison is president of the English Benedictine Congregation and author of Finding Happiness: Monastic Steps for a Fulfilling Life. Drawing on almost 50 years experience as a monk, he has helped set up a website, alonetogether.org.uk, which addresses loneliness and self-sufficiency raised by the current crisis. \u201cThe whole country is going through waves of different feelings,\u201d Jamison says. \u201cOne that came up most in the early stages was anger. People were angry with people in supermarkets; angry with people who were stockpiling; angry with people who didn\u2019t stay at home. There is also a lot of fear around and, later, people will feel lonely and bored.\u201d How does the monastic tradition help counter such feelings? \u201cIf you just leave the day undifferentiated, it can get on top of you. But if you create your own rhythm, you\u2019ll find that the day is more sustainable, bearable and enjoyable.\u201d Jamison draws a distinction between boredom and lethargy. \u201cBoredom is when there is absolutely nothing to do. Lethargy is when there are things to do that you can\u2019t be bothered doing. Most people suffer the latter, but they call it the former because it lets them off the hook. In the monastery, people are always ringing bells telling you what to do next, so you don\u2019t have time to be bored.\u201d Positivity is the key. \u201cDo not begin the day by rehearsing your grievances. Begin by remembering you\u2019re alive and there are good things still. You may have to do tough things later, but take it one step at a time. Begin with gratitude; then ask for the grace to face the day and its difficulties. Then go and address the difficulties.\u201d Doesn\u2019t all that presuppose a belief in God? \u201cYou can,\u201d Jamison insists, \u201cbe grateful without believing in God.\u201d Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, round-the-world sailor In 1969, Knox-Johnston became the first person to make a nonstop single-handed circumnavigation of the globe when he was the only competitor in a round-the-world yacht race to make it home. He was in his late 20s, and sailing a 32ft yacht; the journey took 312 days. Ten weeks into the voyage, Knox-Johnston\u2019s radio broke down. \u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cI could hear people calling me, but I couldn\u2019t respond.\u201d For four and a half months, nothing was heard of him. The Times prepared an obituary. How did he keep himself together mentally? \u201cThat worried me,\u201d he admits. \u201cI took to learning poetry. I had a lovely anthology by Field Marshal Wavell called Other Men\u2019s Flowers. I committed all these wonderful poems to memory. I\u2019d sit there steering while reciting to myself. \u201cI tried to keep to a regular schedule. Sleep during the night, although obviously at times you couldn\u2019t because you had to be on deck. I\u2019d make myself dinner, check everything was all right, then go and have some sleep, wake three or four hours later, check things, go back to bed again. Then, as the sun rose, I\u2019d get up, have a cup of coffee, make breakfast, check the boat and take my sights to work out where I was.\u201d Food was fairly basic, but he had taken 12 bottles of whisky, 12 of brandy and 120 cans of beer, and he enjoyed a whisky or brandy with a cigarette before dinner. Did he ever get drunk? \u201cYou\u2019re on your own,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cThat would be pretty stupid.\u201d Did he miss company? \u201cOh God, yes,\u201d he says, just as emphatically. \u201cGoing past Australia with my receiver working and picking up dance music on a Saturday night. You thought: \u2018What the hell am I doing out here on my own?\u2019 But then you think: \u2018I\u2019m still in this. I\u2019m not giving this up for anything.\u2019\u201d And sex? \u201cYou have to put it out of your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need all your energy for the boat.\u201d Christa Byrne, Scottish islander Byrne has lived with her husband on the island of Colonsay (population 135) in the Inner Hebrides for more than 40 years, first running a hotel and now a bookshop. It is one of the most isolated communities in the UK. For Byrne self-sufficiency is a way of life. \u201cOther people are used to shopping every day for what they\u2019re going to eat,\u201d she says. \u201cWe shop for a month. It\u2019s a completely different mindset.\u201d There are pros and cons to island life. \u201cThere is no crime, and people look out for each other. On the other hand, people know everyone else\u2019s business.\u201d Does the isolation ever get her down? \u201cNo\u201d, she says. \u201cI am a very easy person. But for some people it\u2019s almost impossible. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t sustain much of a population here. It\u2019s heaven on a spring morning, but for weeks and months in the winter it\u2019s really hard.\u201d Byrne says the years-long feuds that used to characterise island life have lessened. \u201cPeople have their opinions and sometimes it would make your hair curl listening to what people say, but overall we do realise we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d She also says the drinking culture is not what it was. \u201cPeople have woken up to the fact that having at least one car in the ditch every weekend is not a good idea.\u201d Her tips for the newly isolated? \u201cKeep busy. Don\u2019t slouch around. Get up in the morning, get dressed, have a plan. It\u2019s too easy to fritter away your time, and that is very soul-destroying.\u201d Does she ever get bored? \u201cI don\u2019t really,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a good book to read, especially if you own a bookshop.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
