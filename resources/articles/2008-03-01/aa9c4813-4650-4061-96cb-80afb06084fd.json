Triesman has been in position as the Football Association's first independent chairman for less than two months but has made it his priority to further his organisation's \"respect\" agenda. Referees are being lost to the grassroots game at an alarming rate due to spectator abuse and Triesman is convinced that the elite end of the sport can contribute more to the overall health of the game. \"What we have among leading managers is an incredible record of accomplishment in the game, and I admire that,\" he said. \"I would also like them to show in the public sense a proper regard for officials. People in that position are very, very visible, and I do expect people will conclude that if a certain behaviour is good for you then it is good for me. You can guarantee that will trickle down to the grassroots.\" The FA has been the English game's rule enforcer for more than a century but in recent years there has been a deterioration of behavioural standards throughout the sport. However, Triesman brings unique experience to his role: as a Foreign Office minister with responsibility for Africa, he was a negotiator in war-torn Sudan. \"It is not war at the FA but it has always had a historic role or focus as the guardian of our sport; that's the heritage and the obligation for me,\" said Triesman. \"When you are in Africa you are dealing with people who have a phenomenal amount of power and authority in their own realm. \"You have to find all sorts of ways of exploring the levers and persuading people of the greater good. You are not standing there with the army waiting to invade, so you have to find other ways. It would be ludicrous to say that [in football] I can succeed where others have failed, but I can promise I will try. I hope that discussions can be more fruitful.\" Triesman's ambitions extend to enforcing a quota system that would enhance the player pool available to the England manager, Fabio Capello. It will be a hugely controversial move among Premier League clubs who, as the employers, would resist FA regulation in this area. But when it was put to him that the FA may be subordinate to clubs mounting legal challenges against quotas, he shot back: \"The Football Association is not subordinate, certainly not while I am chairman. I want to talk about this; I want to talk about the potential availability of players for Fabio, because this is not an issue that will go away at all.\" Meanwhile, the FA plans to invest a record \u00a3200m in football's grassroots over the next five years. It has canvassed 37,000 people, its largest public consultation, to help generate the new FA National Game Strategy 2008-2012. The governing body has committed to invest \u00a344m a year - an increase of \u00a310m - with \u00a315m being handed to the Football Foundation. Key to the initiative is the recruitment and retention of referees and coaches. \"We rely hugely on 400,000 volunteers to run the game at a local level and need to support them more,\" read an FA statement. \"In addition, we will work to improve the behaviour of players and spectators - addressing the critically high numbers of referees dropping out every season because of abuse, as well as providing more support in recruiting and retaining referees. We will aim to provide a high-quality coaching environment for every player, whatever their age or ability. We will also put the policies and procedures in place to safeguard our young players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
