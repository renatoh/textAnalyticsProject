Ederson is ruled out by the muscular problem he sustained against Atalanta in midweek. Bravo lost his status as the No 1 to Ederson after a disastrous 2016-17 season prompted Guardiola to buy the Brazilian. Bravo has not made a Premier League start since May 2018 at Southampton, an effectively dead game as City were already champions. Yet Guardiola, reminded of how he removed Bravo for Ederson said: \u201cWhy should I doubt any player in my team? Why do you ask these questions? You have to respect this guy \u2013 he has won trophies and the Copa Am\u00e9rica. \u201cBravo can do it, of course. We won the Carabao Cup with him, he\u2019s an exceptional keeper, played a lot of games with his national team.\u201d Although Bravo was in the side who beat Arsenal in the 2018 Carabao Cup final, he was dropped for Ederson for last season\u2019s triumph over Chelsea. Guardiola, though, has no reservations about him. \u201cWhy would I have doubts because a player does not play regularly?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d not want to be a player who was doubted by his manager. I\u2019ve seen him in training and I know how fired up he is and how good he is. We are not going to lose because of Claudio.\u201d Bravo came on at half-time against Atalanta but was sent off on 81 minutes. \u201cThe red card was because we lost the ball in a dangerous position,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIn the first season when he was a little bit struggling in the Premier League it was because he comes here and the team was not at top level. The problem was not Claudio. It is easy to point that he is the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a team game and sometimes you make a mistake; sometimes you make a good save and sometimes not. But why should I not have any confidence with one player in my team? He wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise.\u201d City have been accused of tactical fouling by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, along with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini, but Guardiola shrugged off those views. \u201cAsk the managers [or ask] my players as what I tell them when I prepare a game,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, no comment. I know exactly what I said to my players in the last 11 years about what we have to do.\u201d If City lose to Liverpool the champions will be nine points behind but Guardiola said: \u201cWhat happens if we win? I think in November [the title] never ends. I know people will say if we lose it\u2019s over but there will be a lot of games to play and I want to fight until the end. They\u2019re not going to lose many but the season is long and a lot of situations can happen.\u201d City have voiced concerns to Liverpool regarding a possible repeat of the attack on the team coach on the way to Anfield for the Champions League quarter-final first-leg game in April 2018. Guardiola claimed Merseyside police knew then what could happen yet failed to act. \u201cHopefully it will not happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police knew it and didn\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t know what they are going to do. \u201cHopefully it will be an incredible game for the Premier League and all around the world. Hopefully it will not happen the same that happened two seasons ago when we arrive at Anfield. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the bus incident but inside the stadium when the Liverpool fans support, it\u2019s perfect, lovely \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re involved in the sport. The stadium, the history speaks for itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
