The fleecy fugitive faced the clippers on Thursday morning, days after he was found wandering on the property of farmers Peter and Netty Hazell, and shot to international acclaim. The six-year old merino ram\u2019s wool came in at 23.5kg, just short of another ram, Shrek, who spent six years evading shearers in New Zealand until he was captured in 2004. His coat weighed in at a staggering 27kg. Shaun\u2019s clipping took 20 minutes, about ten times longer than the average ovine haircut. Netty Hazell told the ABC that Shaun would be joining the lucrative state agricultural show circuit. \u201cHe will go to our spoilt paddock and probably do a few guest appearances around the state,\u201d she said. His fleece would also go on tour, she added. Once the fleece\u2019s fame dims, Guardian Australia has calculated that it could be used to produce at least 35 jumpers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
