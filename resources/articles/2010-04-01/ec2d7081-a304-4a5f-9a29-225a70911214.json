Carmen Reinhart", "bodyText": "Carmen Reinhart may be the best-known female economist in the world; she must certainly be the most frequently quoted. With fellow academic Ken Rogoff, she has spent the past couple of years comparing this banking crisis with those down the centuries. Together, they produced a book last year called This Time is Different. The title refers to the four most dangerous words in financial history (every bubble begins with some huckster claiming \"this time it really is different\"), while the authors point out how banking crises follow very similar courses \u2013 ending in a surge in government debt and years of economic stagnation. Any opposition politician, whether in Westminster or Washington, seeking to pin wrecked public finances all on the supposed fecklessness of Gordon Brown or Barack Obama should read this book \u2013 and also heed Professor Reinhart's warning that cutting the deficit this year (as the Tories urge) would send the economy back into a slump. The University of Maryland academic has been in the UK this week speaking at the Royal Economic Society conference. Her message was no cheerier: spiralling debt leaves governments exposed to a shock in credit markets. One can disagree with Professor Reinhart's conclusions, but all economists should be grateful for her data-gathering. Her study of banking crises covered 66 countries around the world over eight centuries \u2013 everything from commodity prices to foreign-owned debt. A wonderful resource, albeit a very grim one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
