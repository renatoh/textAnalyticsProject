Formations of F-16s flew at low altitude over Aegean isles for more than 20 minutes on Tuesday as Turkey furiously accused Greece of sheltering terrorists. Ankara vowed to trace the commandos who it claimed participated in the failed July 2016 coup against the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and his government. \u201cIt is our duty to find these \u2018putschist\u2019 soldiers wherever they are, pack them up and bring them to Turkey,\u201d the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Bekir Bozdag, said late on Monday. He personally criticised the Greek prime minster, Alexis Tsipras, for failing to hand the soldiers over to Turkey after they flew into Greek airspace. \u201cFrom statements made in Greece by its prime minister right after the coup, we were of the positive opinion that they would be extradited to Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought that Mr Tsipras would keep his word. With time, though, we saw that the judicial authorities were mobilised and these \u2018putschists\u2019 were not extradited.\u201d The fate of the eight has been in Greek hands ever since the army officers took local authorities aback, landing their helicopter outside the northern border town of Alexandroupolis a day after the abortive coup. The commandos deny involvement in the putsch, which left 250 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. On Monday Greek authorities moved the military personnel out of police custody; following expiry of the 18-month pre-trial period they are legally allowed to be detained while they apply for asylum. They have been placed in top-secret locations under heavy police protection. \u201cGiven Turkey\u2019s mindset, the situation is very dangerous,\u201d said a senior judicial source. \u201cBut this is an issue of justice and we feel strongly that we must stand up for it.\u201d The Turkish government argued there was overwhelming evidence the men participated in the attempted overthrow, which it claims was orchestrated by supporters of the US-based cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen. In the almost two years since, Erdo\u011fan has moved ahead with a large-scale purge of the army and other institutions. With the eight fuelling nationalist sentiment in the run up to parliamentary and presidential polls on 24 June, the Turkish president has raised the issue several times. In April, only days after calling the snap elections, he appeared to raise the prospect of a trade-off saying if the officers were returned, Ankara would consider Athens\u2019 request for the release of two Greek border guards detained after being found in a \u201cforbidden military zone\u201d by Turkish authorities in early March. Greece has repeatedly rejected the extradition requests, with the country\u2019s highest court ruling the men would not receive a fair trial, in contravention of EU law, if they were to go back to Turkey. In April, the tribunal went further, granting one of the eight irrevocable asylum in Greece \u2013 and by extension the EU \u2013 despite Greek government objections. Judgment on the remaining asylum requests is pending. Tensions between the Nato rivals have risen dramatically in recent months with disputes over isles and airspace in the Aegean Sea. Friction along the land border the two neighbours share has also grown since the arrest of the two Greek frontier guards. \u201cThe air violations, like the tensions more generally, should be seen in the context of Turkey\u2019s ambitions to become the region\u2019s hegemon,\u201d retired admiral Vasilios Martzoukos told the Guardian. \u201cThe EU has to recognise that Greece\u2019s borders are Europe\u2019s borders. Tensions are high. Turkey feels strong. It spends $18bn a year on armaments. It doesn\u2019t care about borders or international treaties. What we are seeing is because it has distanced itself from Nato and the values of the west.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
