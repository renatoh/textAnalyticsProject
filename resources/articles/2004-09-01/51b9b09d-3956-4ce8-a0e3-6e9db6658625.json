Torben Sorensen, who took the helm of the 79-year-old company three years ago, designed the house he lives in near Bang &amp; Olufsen's headquarters in the Danish hinterland of the Limfjord and has filled it with the vast abstract oil paintings he creates when he is not listening to classic rock and roll tracks on his own, amazingly expensive stereo system. Sitting in the demonstration room of the company's Canary Wharf store, the 53-year-old claims: \"I am not the brand, it is Bang &amp; Olufsen that is the brand.\" But it is hard not to notice a correlation between the understated elegance of B&amp;O's TVs, CD players and speakers and its well dressed, laid-back chief executive. Born in the university town of Aarhus, he toyed with studying geology or becoming an architect before opting for a business degree as a way of ensuring that he might make money after graduation. After various jobs within the Danish business world he was approached by Danish toy manufacturer Lego in 1996. Addictive The purveyor of little plastic bricks needed to create a new range of products to defend itself against the increasing appeal of computer games. During his six years with the company Mr Sorensen helped to create the Lego Mindstorms range of programmable robot kits. They were a hit, and not only with children. \"One-third of our customers were adult males who were playing around with Lego. It was thoroughly funny for me.\" During the dotcom boom several Silicon Valley start-ups banned staff from bringing Mindstorms kits into work because they were so addictive and no one was getting any work done. \"People often say it's a big jump from Lego to Bang &amp; Olufsen,\" Mr Sorensen says with a smile. \"But the fact is that at Lego I made toys for boys, I still do but now they are for older boys.\" A B&amp;O toy is for a boy with a lot of pocket money. Most people who walk around one of the company's 640 stores spread across the globe will be hard pressed to afford a chrome speaker stand let alone an actual stereo or TV. Its latest top of the range speakers, the BeoLab 5s -metre-high cones that look as if they could beam you down from the Starship Enterprise - cost a whacking \u00a310,000 a pair and that's before you've actually bought anything to plug into them. But its products should not be considered in the same category as the \"here today, gone tomorrow\" consumer goods made by rivals, counters Mr Sorensen. One of the company's TVs has been on the market for 18 years, while the sleek silver stereo system that looks like a hot plate was launched in the 1980s but will plug straight into the company's latest subwoofer. \"Again, it's like Lego. My mother had some of the Lego bricks I used to play with as a boy and they still fit together with what you can buy today. This degree of timelessness in a world where everything is shortened and everything is thrown away somehow struck me when I was approached.\" Lego and Bang &amp; Olufsen occupy a central position in the heart and mind of the average Dane. \"Most kids in Denmark have played with Lego and listened to Bang &amp; Olufsen. Bang &amp; Olufsen is for Denmark, next to the queen, one of the most high-profile jobs you can achieve. Everybody in Denmark follows the company in the same way that everybody in the UK follows BT or Richard Branson or Marks &amp; Spencer.\" While Britain is undoubtedly B&amp;O's largest market in terms of sales, Denmark is where it has the biggest share. Despite its astronomical prices, in a country of about five million people Bang &amp; Olufsen products account for a fifth of the entire Danish market for stereos and TVs. \"In Denmark you find young people like my daughter's friends, who work over the summer and save their money to buy a basic model, or a family may skip their holiday to buy a TV. It is not snobbish, they just appreciate the quality. Somehow people in Denmark are brought up to appreciate design.\" But three years ago B&amp;O dropped into the red as the dotcom bubble collapsed and the company's core adult male audience found itself suddenly cash-strapped. Then came the September 11 terrorist attacks in Washington and New York. When he was offered the top job at B&amp;O in 2001 it was obvious to Mr Sorensen that the company's pre-eminence in Denmark had generated delusions of grandeur. \"When you are a relatively big company in a small town you think you are a big company and then you get all that crap of staff functions and bureaucracy and background operations that you really do not need.\" To address this, Mr Sorensen brought in a new chairman when he took over and set about using Bang &amp; Olufsen's small size and in-house expertise to advantage. He also ended a troubled expansion plan in the US which had merely inflated costs. \"I would not express - and not just because I am polite - anything negative about the past regime, but nothing blinds you like success and you sometimes end up thinking that whatever you do is always right and you become, to some degree, arrogant or complacent, and that happens in many companies. \"Coming from small companies has taught me to have a lot of respect for what is actually productive work and to ignore what is just bullshit in the corridors.\" He dumped the company's multimedia operation and brought its experienced technicians back in-house to create a series of CD and DVD players that can connect directly with the internet or a PC. \"My agenda was get back to the basics, get back to products, because Bang &amp; Olufsen is a products company. The brand comes from the products, it does not come from advertising.\" He also reined in the company's US retail business, shutting down a separate headquarters in Chicago which had been a drain on resources. Last month the group's annual results showed some of the fruits of this labour with profits of more than \u00a330m, up from \u00a325m the previous year. But B&amp;O is by no means out of the woods. Sales, down to \u00a3331m from \u00a3364m in the previous year, are still suffering as several crucial markets, especially Germany, remain sluggish. For the current year B&amp;O is hoping for growth but it will not be dramatic. The downturn caused talk that the families of the two original founders, who still have a sizeable stake, might be looking for a sale of the business. While dismissing this speculation, Mr Sorensen admitted that the company might look at changing the way its shares are split. Like many European companies, it has publicly listed B shares, which carry limited voting rights, and closely held A shares which carry the weight in the boardroom. \"I think possibly in the long run most European companies will have only one class,\" he admits. B&amp;O is also looking to get more out of the wealth of intellectual property created by the company's army of 600 developers who beaver away at its headquarters in Struer on the west coast of Denmark's Jutland peninsula. Solution provider The amplifier technology that makes its BeoLab 5 speaker powerful enough \"to blow away your house\", as Mr Sorensen puts it, has been licensed to other companies such as Sanyo and Samsung, and he wants to plough this cash back into further research. \"You have to have a few intellectual properties that you really exploit and generate finance from so you can continue to be leading edge. You cannot do that by protecting it for yourself. Long term, Bang &amp; Olufsen will survive as a company because we are incredibly good at generating new products. \"This world consists of two types of survivors: either you are a box mover with extreme efficiency in the commodity market or you are a solution provider giving an experience that you will never forget. You cannot survive in the middle.\" B&amp;O has plumped firmly for the latter path. But complexity for its own sake has never been the company's watchword, he stresses. \"When we are evaluating projects in our product committee, which I chair, we look at return on investment and risk, etc, but we also have something called the 'women's acceptance factor', meaning that if it is not simple and cannot be worked with one hand from the sofa with a glass of wine in the other hand it is not Bang &amp; Olufsen.\" The CV Born February 7 1951 Education MBA from Aarhus School of Business; Stanford executive programme, Stanford University Career 1978-82, chief financial officer, Aarhus Stiftsbogtrykkerie; 1982-83 vice-president, Computer Composition, Los Angeles; 1983-88, president, AaS.
