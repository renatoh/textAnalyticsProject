With a string of memorable hits behind them such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, Harvey and Bob Weinstein have long been at the top of Hollywood's power elite. But the admired film moguls now appear to be standing on the brink of disaster as rumours swirl that their studio, the Weinstein Company, is teetering on the edge of financial collapse. Taking into account the company's large debts and a string of box-office flops, many Hollywood insiders believe the long era of the Weinstein brothers as a major force is over. Their hopes for survival appear to rest on an old and familiar face: director Quentin Tarantino. If his latest film, the controversial Inglourious Basterds, proves a mega-hit, it could save the company, just as his earlier smash, Pulp Fiction, saved the Weinsteins' first firm, Miramax, from going over the edge in the 1990s. \"They have always been the cats with nine lives. They have always walked right up to the brink and always managed to pull off a piece of magic,\" said Sharon Waxman, founder of movie news website The Wrap and author of a book about Hollywood mavericks, Rebels on the Backlot. \"Anything can happen,\" she added. But there appears to be no guarantee of survival for the men who helped shape modern movie-going. The Weinstein Company, which was behind last year's Oscar-winning film The Reader, has insisted it is still in good financial shape and is gearing up for a series of new releases. But a recent run of bad news surrounding the company has set Hollywood gossiping about its problems. Waxman said that the situation has become so acute other companies dealing with the studio are asking to be paid in advance. Certainly the firm is showing signs of trouble. At the end of last year it laid off 11% of its workforce. A month later an investment group, Fidelity, marked down the value of its shares in the company by 25%. This month the Weinstein Company hired financial advisers Miller Buckfire, and the Weinsteins issued a statement saying the firm would \"help us navigate through this economic climate\". But Miller Buckfire is primarily known for restructuring deeply troubled outfits. \"I think the company is in big trouble,\" said Waxman. The Weinsteins' troubles are twofold. First, independent movie companies all over America are suffering a serious downturn as audiences snub their productions and major studios concentrate on churning out blockbusting franchise films. Second, the studio appears to have had a run of bad choices. The company was set up to produce genre films, such as horror flicks, that would earn enough money to finance quality pieces such as The Reader. But in recent years neither side of the business has scored many hits. \"The problem is nothing has worked. The lowbrow has not worked, the highbrow has not worked,\" said Waxman. Tongues are now wagging about Weinstein films having their release dates pushed back, because the company supposedly does not have the money to market them. All Good Things, with Ryan Gosling, has had its July release shelved. Shanghai, a thriller set in the 1940s, has been pushed back from September to October. Other projects are still sitting on the shelf. When Harvey Weinstein put his Manhattan apartment up for sale recently it was portrayed in the New York tabloids as a desperate attempt to raise cash to market Tarantino's new second world war epic properly. Indeed, it is with Tarantino, and the upcoming Rob Zombie gore-fest, Halloween II, that many believe the company's hopes lie. Both films are being released in August and the Weinsteins desperately need them to score big at the box office. \"My sources say August could be the cruellest month for them. Everything depends on these two movies. Both are crucial to their survival,\" said Nikki Finke, a long-time Hollywood journalist who writes the Deadline Hollywood Daily website. If the Weinsteins do go under, they will leave a huge legacy. The brothers' first company, Miramax, was the studio that revolutionised Hollywood. It almost single-handedly showed that small-scale quality films could not only reap Oscars but could also score millions of dollars at the box office. Miramax was a roaring success, putting out films such as Pulp Fiction, The Piano, The Talented Mr Ripley and many others. \"The Weinsteins showed Hollywood you can stir up enormous interest and enormous profits from the right independent movies ... they made some glorious movies,\" said Finke. They also triggered a wave of independent films and soon almost every major studio set up its own \"independent\" arm to try to replicate their success. Miramax itself was eventually bought by Disney, with the Weinsteins continuing to run it. That relationship ended in 2005 when the brothers left the firm they had founded and set up the Weinstein Company in a bid to re-create their success. But it has been harder to do the second time around. Now some feel the era of the Weinsteins as major players with their own studio is already at an end. \"It is terribly sad. It would be a terrible loss to those who love film. The movie-going experience will be poorer if they are not around,\" said Waxman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
