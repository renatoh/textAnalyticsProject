If ever an illustration were needed of Newcastle's reduced firepower in the wake of Alan Shearer's retirement, Michael Owen's long-term injury and Shola Ameobi's latest niggle this was it. Fortunately a goalless draw was enough to see Newcastle in today's draw for the first round proper of the Uefa Cup. With Newcastle monopolising possession from the kick-off against limited Latvian opposition, chance after chance was wasted. The consolation was that chances were at least being created. Damien Duff had an inventive night on the right wing but it was not until the 81st minute that James Milner rattled the crossbar with a 25-yard free-kick. That was Newcastle's best moment, witnessed by Shearer who took his seat in St James' for the first time as a fan. Ultimately it was Titus Bramble's header in the first leg in Riga that saw Newcastle through. At least Shearer and the 30,000 present saw Martins give a virtuoso performance during his pre-match introduction. Signed from Internazionale for \u00a310m, the Nigerian passed his medical yesterday and ran around the centre-circle swirling a black and white scarf above his head - a gesture that went down well with the locals. What went down less well was wayward shooting and Glenn Roeder will hope that as well as Martins' clearance, Ameobi's hip problem clears up in time for Villa. Of the game, Roeder said: \"There were some good shots, some down the goalkeeper's throat, but I've been asking the midfield players to get closer to the box and shoot. It would've been nice to put a couple of the chances away but the reaction of the crowd at the end of a 0-0 draw showed me that they enjoyed our build-up play.\" Ameobi's absence meant Roeder partnered Milner and Albert Luque up front. Initially they were helpful participants in Newcastle's pass-and-move game. Luque, perhaps inspired by the lack of interest from abroad in him this summer, actually looks committed for the first time since his \u00a311m transfer last August. However, the Spaniard was unable to sustain the early promise and was guilty of squandering a 70th minute far-post header of the sort Shearer, or Ameobi, would surely have buried. That was one of Newcastle's better second-half opportunities. They had appeared more likely to break through before the interval when Duff was sprightly on the right and Ventspils seemed as if one home goal would lead to several. But But as Newcastle failed to convert any of the openings the Latvians gradually established themselves and the concern for the hosts was that an error at the back or a Ventspils surprise attack would lead to an aggregate equaliser. Steve Harper made no meaningful contribution in the 90 minutes. A favourable draw could mean a similar situation in the first round proper. From there is it the group stage and, Newcastle hope, the long march to the final at Hampden Park next May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
