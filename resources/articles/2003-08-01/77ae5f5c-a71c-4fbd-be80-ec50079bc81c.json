Schumacher insists he is not scared of what might happen this weekend, but Montoya is now only six points behind the German in what is shaping up to be the closest title race for years. Fresh from beating the Ferrari driver, who finished back in seventh, on his home turf in the German grand prix on August 3, the Colombian will arrive in Hungary this weekend feeling confident of preventing the Ferrari championship celebrations that have taken place there in the last two years. \"I feel fit and ready for any hot conditions,\" he said. \"We haven't performed very well in Hungary recently, but our car is much improved this year so I am sure it will suit the Hungaroring much better. \"I know the team is very motivated and so am I.\" The victory in Germany - by a huge 65 second margin, unseen since 1994 - means that Montoya will snatch the overall lead from the German's clasp, with Williams catching up with Ferrari, should he succeed in the sweltering conditions in Hungary. Overtaking is a tough prospect on the revamped track, the second slowest after Monaco. And while Ferrari have faired well in Hungary in previous years, Montoya emerged victorious from Monaco and carries with him the hard to beat combination of the FW25's shorter wheelbase and Michelin tyres. Perhaps Montoya, who has prepared for this weekend 's action in the Miami heat, will face his biggest battle from Michael's brother, team-mate Ralf. The younger Schumacher, fourth overall and 18 points off the lead, was put back in contention today with the FIA overruling the decision to make him start from ten positions back. Ralf was blamed for the pile-up in the first lap at Hockenheim and fined $50,000 but will now start where he qualifies. However, nothing will be decided this weekend, with the title expected to be contested right up until Japan. There are four races left and still several drivers in the running. \"The way the season has gone so far has shown that the situation changes a lot more often than we could have expected. So, it has always been difficult to make predictions,\" said Schumacher this week. \"Everyone is very motivated and I know this not just because of the experience of the past few years we have spent together, but also because of all the phone calls we have exchanged in the past few days. \"Everyone is concentrating fully. Budapest doesn't frighten me.\" McLaren, also on Michelin tyres, will be hoping to keep Kimi Raikkonen in the hunt after the Finn drifted nine points of Schumacher by failing to score at Hockenheim. Despite being almost assured of fourth place, Renault are also holding their breath for Fernando Alonso to step in as a possible winner. The Spaniard has been confirmed with Renault for 2004 along with Jarno Trulli of Italy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
