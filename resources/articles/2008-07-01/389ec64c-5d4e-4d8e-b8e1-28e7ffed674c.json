By the time he began reading engineering at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1980, he had got himself sponsored by the RAF. He signed up the following year and was still in active service when he died. He served in 43, 23 and 8 Squadrons, and flew Tornados during the Gulf war in 1990. In Kuwait on the anniversary of liberation, a passer-by hugged him, and thrust a Kuwaiti flag into his hands. The family still have the flag. He flew missions over Afghanistan and during the Iraq war of 2003. Born in Edinburgh, but brought up largely in Hampshire, Gordon met his wife Helen, a biology teacher, at Oxford. They married in 1987 and their relationship sustained him in a tough working life. He loved being with his children, Connie and Alex and anything to do with computers, science fiction and second world war films. Sandy's third bout of cancer was diagnosed in 2006, and no one expected him to survive past Christmas. But he responded to an experimental drug regime, lived a further 18 months and did a great deal, including flying a Spitfire, taking family holidays and running the Comic Relief mile - having arranged that if he died before the race Helen would run on it carrying his urn. Sandy was straightforwardly generous and a good man. Everyone liked him - including lifelong pacifists. Two weeks after his 46th birthday, he was awarded an MBE for, among other things, inspirational leadership and \"outstanding and humbling courage\". Helen and his children survive him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
