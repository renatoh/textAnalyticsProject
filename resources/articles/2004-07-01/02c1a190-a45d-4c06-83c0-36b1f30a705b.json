At least he gained the reward for doing something about his game between times. Having missed the cut in Versailles, he shares the first-round lead at the K Club with the Dutchman Maarten Lafeber and Australia's Nick O'Hern, the left-hander who tied second in France on Sunday. In short he went out and beat balls, hundreds of them. \"It was pouring with rain on Saturday and Sunday,\" he said, \"but I had no option. I had to find something better than what I had. I had no idea where it was going.\" Yesterday, on a needlessly hard course with players left and right saying they would take level par and stay in the clubhouse, the Englishman got round in a five-under-par 67. His practice session had paid off even before he got to Ireland. He went to the Open qualifying at Sunningdale on Monday and, with rounds of 68, 66, led the qualifiers with Mark Foster. Contrast that with rounds of 78, 78 in France, 14 over par. \"I found something late on Sunday,\" he said. \"I found one or two things that clicked and I started to drive the ball a bit better. There wouldn't have been any point in going to Sunningdale otherwise. Then I got off to a really good start and the confidence started to come back.\" Of yesterday's round he said: \"It's amazing what a bit of confidence does. I would accept a 67 on this course any time, even in a flat calm, never mind a 20mph wind.\" Broadhurst had five birdies and an eagle for what was his best opening round of the season. The Atherstone-born golfer played in the Ryder Cup at Kiawah Island in 1991 where, thanks to some quirky captaincy from Bernard Gallacher, he was given only two games. He had gone to America early, finished in the top 10 in the tournament prior to the matches, was the man in form but did not get on to the course until the afternoon of the second day. There he was the strong man in a winning partnership with Ian Woosnam and went on to win his singles 3 &amp; 1 against Mark O'Meara. Partly because of a severe hand injury, sustained in 2000 while playing the Dubai Desert Classic, he has not played to that standard since. But this course should suit him as one of the European tour's short-game wizards, the more so if the confidence continues to come back. Retief Goosen, the new US Open champion who said he wanted to \"take it easy and have a nice stroll around\", strolled to a 69 despite \"being a bit brain dead the first few holes\". What if he produced three more 69s? \"You'd win by quite a few,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
