Kumar said he had a warm reception at the start of his set at the Lord\u2019s Taverners Christmas lunch, but that the audience quickly turned against him once he spoke about a number of issues including Brexit and Boris Johnson. Kumar, who hosts the BBC comedy series The Mash Report, said he was surprised by how angry the audience became at the event, held at the Grosvenor House hotel, London, on Monday. \u201cI made what I considered to be some extremely mild jokes about Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees Mogg, Theresa May and the Brexit process for not going well.\u201d He said he was amazed by how \u201ceasily offended\u201d the audience was, and how people had booed and heckled him for much of his set. \u201cI sort of knew what I was doing and I knew the risk,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThey were more easily offended than I thought they would be. I would like to apologise if I triggered any of them.\u201d He added it was particularly funny when he told the jeering audience \u201cI should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors\u201d. One man shouted back: \u201cThat was ages ago.\u201d Kumar was the headline act of The Lord\u2019s Taverners Christmas Lunch, which supports children living in poverty or with a disability through sport. The celebrities included Harry Redknapp, the football manager and winner of I\u2019m a Celebrity 2018. The comedian said at the opening of the event that members of the audience were asked to find someone on the table that most resembled Jeremy Corbyn. The former Commons Speaker John Bercow, who was present at the lunch, was booed by the room. Kumar said, however, he was glad he had agreed to do the set. He supports the organisation\u2019s charitable work and said it was important for comedians to get out of their comfort zone, adding: \u201cI was surprised at how angry they were but that\u2019s the way it goes at the end of the day. I spend a lot of time bathing in a glow of consensus, but you have to be willing to say something to people who might not agree with you and take the consequences of what follows.\u201d While there were many displeased with his set, Kumar added that there were members of the audience who apologised to him. Greg James, who hosts The BBC Radio 1 Breakfast show, described Kumar\u2019s treatment as appalling in tweets and condemned audience members who had heckled and booed him. \u201cThere were lots of them who were apologetic and quite upset that it happened,\u201d Kumar said. \u201c[James] was very supportive throughout the whole thing \u2026 You always appreciate it when people stick your neck out to support you.\u201d Kumar said he was surprised by the reaction to his heckling. \u201cI\u2019m sort of amazed by how fascinated people are by the whole thing. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been booed off stage \u2026 I consider it, the life of being a comedian \u2013 they have a right to boo me.\u201d He added that he was doing fine; he had not been hit with bread. \u201cTo clarify, one bread roll was thrown. I want to put that on the record. Definitively, I was not pelted with bread.\u201d A spokesperson for Lord\u2019s Taverners said the charity is not a political organisation and does not endorse the views of its guest speakers. They added: \u201cHowever, nor do we endorse the reaction of a minority of audience members at yesterday\u2019s event. Nish Kumar\u2019s attendance was arranged in good faith and he gave his time for free to support the charity and our work. He follows a long tradition of comedic special guests at the event.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
