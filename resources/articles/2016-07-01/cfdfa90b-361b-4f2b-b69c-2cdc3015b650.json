And then, at final whistle, the Welsh fans hugged and kissed. In a heaving, passionate fanzone in Cardiff, grown men and women wept openly while children laughed with joy as they celebrated one of the greatest sporting triumphs in their nation\u2019s history. Whatever happens next \u2013 and who now would bet against Wales reaching the final? A country more famous for its brave exploits with the oval ball than the round one will remember forever a group of players that exemplified teamwork, industry and pride. The Welsh FA\u2019s campaign tagline, Together Stronger, was well chosen. \u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d said Simon Edmunds, from the seaside town of Barry, who watched the 3-1 win against Belgium. \u201cThis team has done us proud and brought the nation closer. Wales is traditionally a rugby nation \u2013 in my lifetime football has always been second best. This changes that. We\u2019ve waited so long for it.\u201d Indeed it has. The nation that counts John Charles, Ian Rush and Ryan Giggs among its great footballers had gone more than half a century without this sort of success. Wales had not reached a major championship at all since 1958, when they lost 1-0 in the quarter finals to Brazil \u2013 thanks to a first-ever World Cup goal for Pel\u00e9. The success of Gareth Bale and his teammates in Friday night\u2019s Euro 2016 quarter-final means that old disappointments can finally be put behind them. Semi-final opponents Portugal should beware. The excitement in Wales had grown during the day. Across the country, schoolchildren, bank staff, and office workers had exchanged their uniforms and suits for red Welsh tops. Tattoo parlours reported a brisk business in dragon motifs, butchers in lamb chops and shoulders as barbecues were fired up. Companies that employ nightshift workers had set up giant screens in the hope of encouraging staff not to pick up a convenient migraine or touch of summer cold. Radio stations had torn up their usual playlists to blare out Welsh favourites from Manic Street Preachers to Shirley Bassey and Catatonia \u2013 whose 1990s bilingual song International Velvet, featuring the lyrics \u201cEveryday when I wake up/I thank the Lord I\u2019m Welsh\u201d, had a particular resonance on this of all days. Some of those in the fanzone in Cardiff had travelled from far and wide, keen to stand shoulder to shoulder with their countrymen and women. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere else tonight,\u201d said Steve Bay, a builder from Brecon, who was sporting a woolly sheep hat. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be Welsh, proud to be part of this. That\u2019s the thing \u2013 this team has made us feel part of something. I\u2019ll never forget them for that.\u201d The extraordinary thing about the mood in the fan zone, just behind Cardiff castle, was that it was always joyful, never nervous. When the goals went in and the beer was thrown high into the air, it was done with a sense of pure happiness, not relief. It felt like they always knew. Jill Jones, an accountant based in the US, had taken time off to jet back into Cardiff so that she could watch the game with her mates. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s been great,\u201d she beamed. \u201cAt times like this you need to be with your nearest and dearest. This is one of the best days of my life. We\u2019re a small nation \u2013 just 3 million people. But when you work together anything is possible.\u201d Many of those in the fanzone were not old enough to remember the 1958 tournament and have endured years of torment as Wales so often fell short. Others, like eight-year-old Stan \u2013 who was playing football with his mates in a corner of the beer-soaked field, has only good memories of Wales. \u201cWe\u2019re the best in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBale\u2019s the best footballer in the world. He\u2019ll get Cristiano Ronaldo, no problem.\u201d There are already some striking statues in Cardiff \u2013 the architect of the NHS, Nye Bevan, musician Ivor Novello and rugby star Gareth Edwards to name but three. There will surely be a clamour now for a statue to commemorate the exploits of this team. Bill O\u2019Keefe, who takes visitors on guided tours of the Welsh capital, had spent the day talking football to his clients as well as history. He had been telling German visitors that Wales would see them in the final. \u201cThey\u2019ll be putting up statues of this team now, naming roads after the manager,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be Sir Gareth [Bale], hasn\u2019t it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
