Wales spoke to North, who was part of the last World Cup campaign, about his work rate after the November defeat by New Zealand when they felt he stayed on his wing too often rather than look for the ball. Cuthbert, who scored Wales\u2019 two tries in a record victory when they last played England in Cardiff, has turned down the offer of a dual contract and appears intent on moving to a club in England or France. North, who at the age of 22 has won 45 caps, was a key figure for the Lions in the 2013 series against Australia but missed the autumn victory over South Africa through injury and his replacement, Liam Williams, stood out. \u201cIt was only the second time ever that we beat South Africa and as coaches it is good to have competition for places,\u201d said the Wales attack coach, Rob Howley. \u201cLiam was outstanding against the Springboks and we have world-class athletes in George and Alex. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say George did drop off a bit. I have spoken to him since the autumn series about his getting involved in games and having the ball in his hands as often as possible, creating opportunities. You have to be mindful of the way Northampton want to play and the challenge for us as coaches is to try and get him to be proactive and understand where the ball is going to go. \u201cAlex\u2019s workrate in November was outstanding as was his attitude. He is a finisher and you need those in international rugby. I saw him last week and he seems in a better place than he was for whatever reason. It is not for me to comment on his contract but to make sure he is right to be selected against England.\u201d North has scored 19 tries for Wales and symbolises the way they play, big, powerful and quick. A lot has happened in a short time for the wing who has scored 11 tries for Northampton this season while reaching a plateau at international level. The task for the Wales management is getting North back to his best and deciding whether that will take the indignity of being dropped. \u201cAny player can be left out and with the competition we have got for the back three that is something we will discuss,\u201d said Howley. \u201cGeorge is a world-class player who can turn a game. The challenge of coaches is to get selection right at whatever level. We have to sit own in the next couple of weeks when they come into training. George\u2019s development has been astronomical over the last two years in terms of what he has achieved and who he has done it against. We need to keep challenging our players, making sure they get better. George tries hard but it is about being smart.\u201d Other than the back three, Wales will have few selection debates before facing England: the make-up of the bench will probably take up more time than the starting line-up. As combinations are settled, so is Wales\u2019 approach to the game, direct and uncompromising, although Howley bristles at the pejorative term \u201cWarrenball\u201d coined in Australia in 2013 to describe the tactics of their head coach, Warren Gatland. \u201cThere is a rugby understanding of how the game is being played, at international level,\u201d said Howley. \u201cEveryone criticises Warrenball and I feel sorry for Jamie Roberts [the Wales centre] who is always cited as an ingredient in it. Those who go on about it show a total lack of understanding of the game at the top level and its landscape. \u201cWhy is Manu Tuilagi so important to England, Ma\u2019a Nonu to New Zealand or Jean de Villiers to South Africa? \u201cThere is a stylistic approach to international rugby which is a determinant of outcome of success. In the past two years we haven\u2019t played Warrenball perhaps as much as we should have. I think the last time it was used was when the Lions put 40 points on Australia in the third Test. That wasn\u2019t a bad result.\u201d England will know what to expect at the Millennium Stadium, although Wales are looking for a cuter kicking game. \u201cThe evidence would show we are more settled than them, but you have to admire their strength in depth across the board,\u201d said Howley. \u201cThe players will come into camp confident after the victory over South Africa and while the World Cup is our goal, we have to get it right in the Six Nations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
