One year ago his world at Leicester City started to crumble with a humiliating Cup defeat to Wycombe, and within seven months he was gone. It is to his credit that he gamely took on a drop to the Second Division, to a club on the mend after coming perilously close to dropping into the Conference five years ago. Now Brighton are on for a second successive promotion, and Taylor might be visiting Leicester again sooner than expected. There is lots to do before then, of course, but his team can be satisfied to have taken four points off the leaders Reading within the last month. That might have been six had Gary Hart's last-minute effort not been disallowed for a foul by Junior Lewis on Reading's goalkeeper Phil Whitehead. Brighton's raptures were ruptured and Reading were relieved to keep their five-point lead at the top of the table. Though this was declared \"the game everyone's been waiting for\" by the public address announcer before the start, it will soon become the game everyone has forgotten. It was nervy stuff with defences on top, strikers off colour. Not even the long legs of Bobby Zamora could add some glitter. \"It was not a very good match for him,\" said Taylor, who observed that his striker's yellow card before half-time stole his aggression for fear of seeing red at the most inopportune time of the season. Zamora, who has scored 24 of Brighton's 52 league goals this season, is vital to the cause. \"There is no point anybody ringing me before [the transfer] deadline,\" Taylor added firmly, to dissuade those that are keeping him under constant surveillance. \"We're desperate to get promotion.\" So too are Reading, whose majestic stadium implores higher-graded football to come calling. Though conceding that his team could have played better, the manager Alan Pardew spoke of the \"nice cushion\" his team still have. But perhaps Saturday's most significant moment was the announcement that Stoke, who had started the day in third place, had lost. It was Wycombe who beat them - you could say they owed Taylor one. Man of the match: Paul Brooker (Brighton)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
