Thank you", "bodyText": "When Guardian Australia launched its membership program this time four years ago we started with 1,500 supporters. This week we\u2019ve hit 150,000 supporters \u2013 a neat symmetry of numbers, with some added zeroes. Setting this goal was driven by the belief that a plurality of voices in the media landscape \u2013 and getting the highest quality independent journalism into the hands of many \u2013 is good for democracy and good for public discourse. We keep saying this, but the challenges to journalism from many quarters are unrelenting \u2013 perpetual job losses, disappearing newsrooms, the undermining of the business model, the loss of regional news coverage, cuts to the public broadcaster. More than ever, public interest journalism needs to be strong and it needs to be supported \u2013 and in the case of Guardian Australia, reader support is part of our strength. It safeguards our future. As we leave the first half of this confounding year behind, we are focused on the need to unravel the growing complexities of today\u2019s world and, as Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, said, ask the urgent questions arising from the great ructions we have seen over the past six months. Your support means we can ask those questions and tell more stories. Thanks to you we have been able to pursue ambitious, high-impact, award-winning journalism on topics including the climate crisis, bushfires, logging and land clearing, Indigenous deaths in custody, the destruction of Aboriginal sites, the coronavirus pandemic, the questionable use of taxpayers\u2019 money by MPs, the ongoing threats to species, the robodebt scandal and, of course, the political issues of every day. Now we are embarking on more vital projects \u2013 a deep dive into how young Australians will cope with unprecedented unemployment rates, an investigation into how it is that so many Indigenous children are in jail, and how the disruptions of 2020 can give rise to an environmentally friendly recovery. As always, we\u2019ll continue to give voice to the voiceless, and hold power to account. Your support is not only financial. The messages we receive about why you choose to pay for our journalism when you don\u2019t have to, and why our journalism is important to you, are motivating. My greatest privilege as membership editor is being in this two-way conversation, and knowing you feel part of our community. During this difficult year the newsroom has found inspiration \u2013 and great comfort \u2013 in your words of encouragement. We\u2019ve gathered some of these messages from supporters and created an interactive map of Australia for you to explore. Please take a look and, if you would like to, share your thoughts with us. Thank you for spreading the word about Guardian Australia journalism and for helping us to grow and reach our goal. Because it\u2019s been so successful, we\u2019re going to continue it just for a little longer. Together we can do more. Guardian Australia has reached its goal of growing its community to 150,000 supporters. Help us grow further with a contribution of any size"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
