The 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford on Wednesday was Spurs\u2019 first under Mourinho, coming after three straight wins since his arrival. He detected sadness in the dressing room rather than anger and, as his team attempt to bounce back against Burnley on Saturday, has sent a clear message that their mentality needs to change. \u201cOne of the things I said was that I saw a sad dressing room, a sad plane and that\u2019s not what I like after a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be more than that. You have to be raging, angry, not sad. Being sad will not resolve your problems. You need that mentality. \u201cWe have to play and resolve the problems step by step. We have problems, there is no doubt, but we have players with quality, a great human dressing room. But we have to change the feeling of being sorry. We need to be more than that.\u201d Mourinho, who spent the night at Spurs\u2019 training ground after returning from Manchester, rising early to prepare for the game against Sean Dyche\u2019s side, expanded on his thoughts regarding how to handle defeat. \u201cThe thing I want from them and I hope they understand my message, is that I don\u2019t like sad people in this sense of the word,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be sad after the game. I want people who, after defeat, would love a match the next morning. Not feeling sad. \u201cSad is not the kind of reaction that I like and these players need this kind of message. They need to say: \u2018OK, I don\u2019t accept defeat, that is not something that belongs to my culture. I don\u2019t accept defeat.\u2019 Don\u2019t be sad. Let\u2019s go \u2013 next day, next match.\u201d Spurs travel to Bayern Munich next Wednesday for what is a Champions League dead rubber, with the German side guaranteed top spot in Group B and Mourinho\u2019s team secure in second. He mentioned Troy Parrott, Kyle Walker-Peters, Oliver Skipp and Ryan Sessegnon as young players who would be involved, a relentless schedule meaning he has had no time to experiment. There has also been scant opportunity to fine-tune his ideas in training and he has earmarked the week between their visit to Wolves on 15 December and their home match against Chelsea seven days later as one to work with his players. \u201cProbably in normal conditions it would be nice for the players to have some days off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is the kind of week where it is my only chance to have them, so we are going to work that week.\u201d Christian Eriksen\u2019s role in Mourinho\u2019s team remains unresolved, with the playmaker seemingly destined to depart for a fee next month or for free in the summer. Mourinho said the pair had spoken but would not reveal the outcome of those talks. \u201cIt\u2019s for him to say. I have to defend the best interests of my club. I will not tell you what we said. I am perfectly fine if he wants to say but I have to have respect for the player.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
