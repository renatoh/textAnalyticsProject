The president's launching a major peace initiative in the Middle East and the story we have to go with is that we can't show him doing it.\" For the White House, and specifically the National Security Council, spokesperson Anna Peres remains unflappable. \"We are in Egypt, David, and as you might imagine the Egyptians make the rules,\" she tells Gregory, trying to explain why the networks' pool crew has been ejected from the presidential meeting-room, their mobile phones confiscated, even their TV equipment sequestered. \"Whose side are you on, Anna?\" Gregory fires back. The question hangs in the air for a decidedly stressful hour, until the standoff is resolved by Egyptian State Television producing images of George Bush meeting Egypt's President Mubarak. Indeed, to our amazement, the Egyptians produce images of Bush speaking informally to Arab leaders, the kind of straight talk the White House never intended us to see and broadcast. A week on the White House press plane, hopping from one diplomatic flashpoint in the Middle East to the next with the Bush bandwagon, produces a number of such moments - and any number of questions. How skilful is the White House manipulation of its press corps? How restricted is access to decision-makers? And to what extent are the US media supine post 9/11? What's so striking, for anyone who's worked with the Blair machine in recent years, is the starvation diet that faces White House correspondents. The hors d'oeuvres on board the White House plane are tasty, fine Burgundy (yes, French wine on a Bush plane) flows in the galleys, but reporters rarely see a spokesperson in the loop of high-grade information - or obtain a quote that doesn't come straight out of the spin doctor's handbook. \"Access is horrible, truly horrible,\" says John Roberts, chief White House correspondent for CBS. \"Sometimes we don't get fed anything of value for days and information is used like starvation rations. These people work on the basis that you'll end up grateful for whatever you get.\" Newspaper correspondents blame the TV stars, who seek to be in the forefront of any briefing or press conference, for dumbing down the journalism. Broadcast journalists believe their print colleagues often seek arcane detail that obscures the big picture. \"We've lost the plot in recent years,\" says Jim Angle, correspondent for Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. \"The public hated the gotcha journalism of the Clinton years, and the natural tendency is to go to the other extreme, especially after September 11... we've stopped asking the tough questions, in my view.\" The final day of Bush's Middle East odyssey, however, produces a gem, made only in America. The president summons the small team of pool reporters that do go with him on Air Force One, minus the TV camera that's on board, to his private conference room in the front section of the presidential jet. There, Bush, jacket off, soft drink in hand, shoots the breeze for 45 minutes. The transcript makes for some compelling reading - and rare insight into the Bush presidency. 'I'm not a very formal guy to begin with,\" Bush tells the pool. \"I'm also not very analytical. You know I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things. The meetings [in the Middle East] are informal, they're kind of relaxed. I think one of my styles is trying to relax people.\" Asked whether his diplomacy has exceeded expectations, he answers, \"I'm a master of low expectations\" before adding, \"I'm a great delegator.\" In conclusion, quizzed about who will do the follow-up work to keep the Road Map for peace on track, Bush turns to the language of the Texas cowboy to outline the job that now falls to a special presidential envoy. \"They've got the guy on the ground that is going to - he's just going to - I used the expression, ride herd. I don't know if anybody understood the meaning. It's a little informal in diplomatic terms. I said, we're going to put a guy on the ground to ride herd on the process.\" For once, the foreigner in the White House press pack cannot gripe. \"Would Tony Blair let you guys talk with him like that?\" asks an American colleague. It's a good question. \u00b7 David Smith is Washington correspondent for C4 News"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
