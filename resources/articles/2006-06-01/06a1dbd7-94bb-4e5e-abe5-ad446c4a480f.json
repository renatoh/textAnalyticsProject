The 35-year-old goalkeeper is believed to have asked for a 25% wage increase to remain at Ibrox but those demands been refused by the club's new manager Paul Le Guen. Waterreus has already dropped his demand for a new two-year contract after learning that the club was only willing to offer one more season. His agent admits finances have been a stumbling block but says that further talks are planned for later this week. The former PSV and Manchester City goalkeeper has options elsewhere in Europe and America but his representative, Kees Ploegsma, insists Rangers remain his first choice if a deal can be thrashed out. \"I intend to come to Scotland this week and we will see what happens then,\" he said. \"Everything is still possible and Rangers are still Ronald's first option.\" Waterreus was recruited in January 2005 as emergency cover after Stefan Klos suffered ligament damage in a training-ground incident and controversially held on to his place in the team when the German returned to fitness. Klos has been ruled out for the first two months of next season after damaging a shoulder in a cycling accident. Le Guen is not willing to be held to ransom and has identified a potential replacement should talks with Waterreus end in stalemate. The France Under-21 goalkeeper Steve Mandanda was believed to be at the top of his wanted list but reports suggest he has turned his attention to the Paris St-Germain veteran Lionel Letizi. The 33-year-old played 27 games this season but could be available after PSG signed the France back-up keeper Michael Landreau."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
