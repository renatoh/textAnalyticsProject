Sellars's devastating collaboration with mezzo Lorraine Hunt Lieberson was heckled in Paris last week. I suspect the flak was generated by Sellars's insistence on introducing the cantatas in terms guaranteed to make any purist scream. Bach's music, he maintained, was the product of a culture in which spirituality was woven into the fabric of daily life. Few would disagree - but at this point, anachronistic specifics started to creep in. The cantatas represent \"a kind of Twelve Step programme of working through issues\". Mein Herze Schwimmt im Blut (\"My Heart Swims in Blood\") is \"about a woman recovering from attempted suicide\". Ich Habe Genug (\"I Have Had Enough\"), meanwhile, is \"a very precise image of the last 25 minutes of somebody's life on this planet\". Its first recitative depicts \"the disconnecting of the artificial life support\". No one was quite prepared for what followed. Mein Herze Schwimmt im Blut initially finds Hunt Lieberson kneeling in an attitude of utter abjection, wearing a blue dress and enveloped in a blood-coloured scarf which represents the tangled mess of her existence. As the cantata progresses she becomes increasingly imprisoned by the scarf's folds until enlightenment dawns and she seems to fly into freedom with the bolts of cloth fluttering round her like wings. Much has already been made of Sellars's use of Tibetan Buddhist imagery in his staging. Its genius, however, lies in his discovery of a physical language that encapsulates emotional extremes and asserts the universality of spiritual experience. The imagery intensifies in Ich Habe Genug, in which Sellars and Hunt Lieberson take us unflinchingly into daunting territory, in which the body, dissolving in death, becomes a leaky sac of fluids while the soul battles to reach infinity. Her blue dress has become a surgical gown. In place of the scarf, Hunt Lieberson is now entangled in a morass of drips and drains. An actor holds a naked light bulb over her head - at once the light of God and the lamp over a hospital bed - towards which she struggles in agony. Some of it is unbearable. It ranks among the most heart-rending things I've ever seen. This is one of the finest things Sellars has done - though the whole evening was unthinkable without Hunt Lieberson. Her voice, infinitely beautiful, cleaved the air with pain and rapture. She moved with the flexibility of a dancer. Few performers have ever pushed themselves to comparable extremes in search of such naked emotional truth. The conducting and playing from Craig Brown and the Orchestra of Emmanuel Music was incredible, too. Having inveighed in the past against staged versions of non-theatrical vocal works, this proved me to be completely wrong, which is the highest compliment I can pay it."}, "isHosted": false}}}
