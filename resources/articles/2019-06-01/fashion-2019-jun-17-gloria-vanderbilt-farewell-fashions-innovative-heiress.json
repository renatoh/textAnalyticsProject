She was photographed by top names including Richard Avedon and Horst P Horst and appeared in Vogue as well as Harper\u2019s Bazaar. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s, when Vanderbilt was in her 50s, that she established her design credentials, becoming an early pioneer of stretch jeans. Vanderbilt worked with manufacturer Mohan Murjani to popularise jeans for women at a time when they were largely designed for men. She was among the first to use a famous family name in the marketing of a fashion line, emblazoning her signature across the back pocket of the famously fitted designs. The Amanda jeans which \u2013 as she put it \u2013 \u201creally hug your derri\u00e8re\u201d cemented her place in fashion history, and proved innovative enough to spark a $100m (\u00a379m) empire. \u201cThe marketing of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans is one of the most dramatic American business success stories of the decade,\u201d reported the New York Times in 1979. Yet her style legacy goes beyond the clothes she designed: as an heiress and socialite, Vanderbilt regularly featured in best-dressed lists. She expanded her product line to include other logoed items, as well as perfumes, sheets, shoes and accessories. Meanwhile, her friend Truman Capote is said to have based the character of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s on her. The novella was famously made into a film starring another fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn. Vanderbilt was admired by others within the industry, with fellow designer Roy Halston Frowick, AKA Halston, remarking that she had \u201cbecome a professional in the most difficult, cutthroat business there is, and I say, \u2018good show\u2019.\u201d Designer Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg, best known for popularising the wrap dress, also noted that Vanderbilt \u201ctried to do many, many things for many, many years. The thing that you least associated her with \u2013 jeans \u2013 worked.\u201d Like Lee Radziwill, who also died earlier this year, Vanderbilt might also be described as \u201cthe original influencer\u201d, often appearing in person to promote the products bearing her name. From 1978 to 1984, she was reported to have earned more than $17m. However, by the time the Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corporation was sold to the Jones Apparel Group in 2002 for $100m, she had withdrawn all interest in the company. \u201cI\u2019m not knocking inherited money,\u201d she told the New York Times in 1985, \u201cbut the money I\u2019ve made has a reality to me that inherited money doesn\u2019t have.\u201d In a world where the denim industry has become king and worth an estimated \u00a371bn, Vanderbilt\u2019s passing will rightfully reflect on \u2013 and celebrate \u2013 the legacy she leaves behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
