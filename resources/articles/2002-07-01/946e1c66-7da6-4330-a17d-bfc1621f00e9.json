When India are at the top of their game, there is no more talented team in the world, but I still fancy that England's steadiness in home conditions will see them through. England's World Cup planning looks pretty much on track, and boy, does it need to be. They will be well suited to South African conditions, not too dissimilar to their own, but with India, Australia and Pakistan in the same group, it will take a formidable effort to finish in the top three and qualify for the Super Sixes. England are a more physical team these days. With the likes of Trescothick, Irani and Flintoff, they have a team of hitters, physically able to whack the ball. Rain interruptions have suited them - the shorter the game, the better. Then they have some lively bits-and-pieces players in support. Paul Collingwood has caught my eye. He's not scared to throw his body in there. People question whether Irani and Collingwood can play in the same side, but I don't see a problem. Ronnie Irani is a revelation. These days he knows the game and, just as importantly, he knows his own game. But it is his incredible desire that is so impressive. Ronnie finds it fun to be out there, and that is part of his secret. He's always been a renowned county hitter, but he seems to have tempered it a bit, and he hits straighter than he used to. I'm still not sure he's up to strength against spin, though. His bowling is tantalisingly the slow side of medium and, although he claims to move it around a bit, I watched him take five wickets against India at the Oval and I still can't say he's great at it. He is still a bit round-arm, which encourages batsmen to wait for the stray delivery. In the NatWest Series it has never come. He has bowled straight and accurately throughout. Marcus Trescothick is another who can change the game in a trice. He is certainly the right size to hit down the ground, and the only way to curb him is by getting him out, although I wouldn't call him \"great\" - not yet, anyway. I think the great one-day players are the fit, athletic types: a Jonty Rhodes, or maybe even a Nick Knight. If Trescothick wants to achieve his maximum potential, he needs to be fitter. Freddie Flintoff has shown how performance is fitness-related and Trescothick could enjoy the same knock-on benefits. It would make him stronger and help his concentration during long innings. It could come down to a vital catch in a World Cup semi-final, and whether he holds it. Flintoff's development has given me great pleasure, especially so because of my time as Lancashire coach. He is now a vital component, the man who Nasser Hussain throws the ball to when he is under stress, and a mighty hitter late in the innings. He has credited his agent, Chubby Chandler, with sitting him down and telling him he was wasting his talent. It's a speech that a few of us have made - but it's often the right person at the right time who makes most sense. India's losing record in finals cannot be put down entirely to bad luck. They tend to become a bit reckless on the big occasions as if, for all the one-day internationals they have played, they are still unsure how to handle the pressure. Their fast bowling attack should be in good order by the World Cup. I like the look of Ashish Nehra. He hits the seam and his accuracy and fitness has improved. And as much as Joey Srinath insists he is at an age when Test cricket has become too much, he should be an automatic choice for the World Cup. India's top six are also exceptionally talented. They are generally more reliant on skill than brute force, although Yuvraj Singh can clear the ropes. Virender Sehwag is another who can break open a game at will. Rahul Dravid's wicketkeeping will never win any style awards, but I expect him to keep in the World Cup. He balances the side and he is a calming influence. And for Indian wicketkeepers, that can be a full-time job. Then there is Sachin Tendulkar, the master. We saw clear evidence of his excellence with his hundred at Chester-le-Street. England will regard once as enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
