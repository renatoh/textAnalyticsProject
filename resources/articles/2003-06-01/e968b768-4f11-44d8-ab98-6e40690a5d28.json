The crisis was triggered when the New York Times revealed 27-year-old reporter Jayson Blair had left the paper after fabricating and plagiarising dozens of stories. In a soul-searching front-page article on May 11, the newspaper admitted Blair's \"frequent acts of journalistic fraud\" represented a low point in its 152-year history. The New York Times assigned a seven-man team to investigate all 673 stories Blair had contributed to the paper during his four years there, after he was found to have lifted material from a story in the San Antonio News Express about a dead soldier's family. The practice of using material from freelances or even rival papers may be commonplace in the British press but the New York Times built its reputation on fact-checking and guaranteed authenticity. Macarena Hernandez, a correspondent for the San Antonio News Express who had been a New York Times intern with Blair in the summer of 1998, spotted the deception. The paper issued a 14,000-word apology to its readers for the Blair scandal, which many felt could bring Raines' editorship to an end. Problems deepened when the paper revealed a number of other reporters were coming under scrutiny. Fresh embarrassment followed last week, when Pulitzer prize-winning writer Rick Bragg quit the New York Times. New Orleans-based Bragg resigned after the paper published an editor's statement admitting he had relied heavily on the work of a freelance reporter for an article about Florida oyster farmers. The Washington Post then reported on an email squabble between two Pulitzer prize-winning Times writers, Judith Miller and the Baghdad bureau chief, John Burns. Bragg's resignation intensified the pressure on Raines, whose two-year tenure had left many Times journalists disenchanted and embittered. Raines came under fire for the Blair scandal as a number of senior writers had already expressed misgivings about the journalist's conduct - more than a year ago one of his editors said he did not believe Blair should be writing for the Times. Staff accused Raines of creating a star system that promoted favourites such as Blair while sidelining experienced reporters. There was suggestion from some quarters that \"affirmative action\" had allowed the premature promotion of Blair, who is black. At a staff meeting after news of the scandal broke, Raines said: \"You have a right to ask if I, as a white man from Alabama with those convictions, gave him one chance too many. When I look into my heart for the truth of the matter, the answer is yes.\" Blair had often invented information from unnamed sources on major stories, from the Washington sniper case to the Iraq war. Arthur Sulzberger Jr, the chairman of the New York Times Company, described the revelations at the time as a \"huge black eye\". \"It's an abrogation of trust between the newspaper and its readers,\" he said. When he emerged from his silence over the affair, Blair hit back by branding the New York Times a racist \"snake pit\" and saying he hoped the incident would make Raines \"a little mature\". Blair, who started on the paper as a graduate trainee, had already been warned when colleagues became suspicious of his ability to cover so much ground. It transpired that Blair had often filed from New York while pretending to be at the scenes of big stories. \"His tools of deceit were a cell phone and a laptop computer - which allowed him to blur his true whereabouts - as well as round-the-clock access to databases of news articles from which he stole,\" said the Times report that lifted the lid on his practices. Rupert Murdoch's New York Post confessed to its own minor scandal, when it named and shamed freelance Robin Gregg for lifting an article from the National Enquirer about US talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford. The New York Post editor, Col Allan, said Gregg would never contribute to the paper again. \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
