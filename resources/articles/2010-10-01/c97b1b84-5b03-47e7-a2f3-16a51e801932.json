It did not prevent a century of spectacular military and naval cock-ups, plus false economies, which culminated in the disaster of the first world war.A further century on, plenty of analysts fear that continuing talk of being a \"world-class military power\" \u2013 as David Cameron and William Hague have done again this week \u2013 smacks more of imperial nostalgia than realism. Nonetheless Cameron did a fluent and persuasive job today in presenting what sounded suspiciously like defence cuts dressed up as a strategic defence review, the first since George Robertson's admired SDR 15 months after Labour took office in 1997. Armed with impressive detail, the PM papered over cracks and cost-cutting risks with aplomb. Trust between him and his defence secretary, Liam Fox, whose made-for-TV protest letter was promptly leaked, is clearly low. Yesterday Fox was at his side - for now. In one of his first acts in office Cameron created a National Security Council which unveiled its first strategy paper on Monday. Terrorism (including Irish terrorism) emerged as the No 1 priority, followed, less predictably, by cyberwarfare. Today he set about paying for those priorities \u2013 \u00a3500m for a cybersecurity programme \u2013 by scrapping cold war tanks, planes and ships, sacking 17,000 military personnel and \u2013 less conspicuously \u2013 25,000 civilian staff. The army, which bears the Afghan brunt and has most political muscle, comes off best. Is it another case of false economy, misjudged priorities or grandiose ambition? Tory MPs are rattled (Lib Dems pleased) by the postponement to 2016 of Trident's replacement. Labour defence buffs also question the maths. On the carrier strike gap \u2013 ships without the right planes for a decade \u2013 even No 10 admits the risk. Defence fits more comfortably into the Tory worldview than Labour's. Yet it was Iron Lady Thatcher's decision (another risky one) to scrap HMS Endurance in 1981 that led directly to the Falklands war. Her government's tacit support for Saddam Hussein's war against Iran led to successive Gulf wars and John Major's studied neutrality in Bosnia \u2013 which later pushed Tony Blair in the opposite direction, towards costly interventionism that overstretched MoD resources. Cameron, who takes defence seriously, seeks to avoid past errors. He will have been told that the Tory SDR in 1990, the cold war \"peace dividend\" which slashed service personnel by 18%, left long-term recruitment and training problems. His emphasis on better diplomacy, intelligence and development aid to boost conflict prevention suggests painful lessons have been also learned from the Falklands and Iraqlearned. It is always cheaper to prevent wars, though fighting terrorism \u2013 \"non-state actors\" in the jargon \u2013 is proving neither easy nor susceptible to purely military solutions. The IRA war showed that. The paradox of Cameron's twin reviews is that Britain has never been \"more secure and more vulnerable\" in a complex inter-dependent complex world where viruses injected into software could bring down the power grid and much else. Russian tanks have retreated, but pirates are back. Send for Nelson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
