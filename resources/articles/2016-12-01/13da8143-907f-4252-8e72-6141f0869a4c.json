Archery, badminton, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby saw their funding wiped out, while British Cycling\u2019s bumpy year off the track worsened as it suffered a \u00a34.3m cut. UK Sport warned \u201cfurther conditions\u201d could be applied to that money if the independent review into cycling\u2019s culture, which is expected next month, was critical. Adrian Christy, the head of GB Badminton, said the sport would appeal against the cut given Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge won bronze at Rio to secure Britain\u2019s first men\u2019s doubles medal and a crop of talented youngsters are coming through. \u201cWe are staggered by this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is incomprehensible. Despite the most successful Olympic Games since 2004 for GB badminton, the decision presents a catastrophic impact on the sport and it will mean the cessation of all the funding that supports the performance and operations of our current squad of players.\u201d Writing in the Guardian, David Pond, the chief executive of Great Britain Wheelchair Rugby, admitted his surprise and described the implications for his sport as \u201cstark\u201d. Earlier the UK Sport chair, Rod Carr, stressed British Cycling\u2019s steep decline in funding from \u00a330.2m to \u00a325.9m to prepare for Tokyo 2020 was owing to its underperforming BMX and mountain bike programme as well as the need for it to use a sponsorship deal with HSBC to fund elite sport. He also warned if an independent review upheld bullying and sexism allegations, or a parliamentary body raised serious questions about the sport\u2019s lack of transparency, it could \u201cfundamentally undermine\u201d its success. \u201cGovernance is a really important issue, whether it be Fifa or IAAF, and if there were issues in British Cycling, it fundamentally undermines everything,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIf people don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing on the track, if things are getting done in a way that we as the public think is untoward, then it\u2019s really bad news so we take that very seriously.\u201d Carr also admitted he was concerned about the lack of transparency over what was in the package a member of British Cycling\u2019s staff delivered to Team Sky for Bradley Wiggins on the day he won the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 in 2011. \u201cOf course it worries me but you learn not worry about things until you have the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough this, and I\u2019m hoping there aren\u2019t any issues, but if there are then we\u2019ll confront it because it\u2019s really important.\u201d But Chelsea Warr, the director of performance at UK Sport, predicted the funding decisions would help British athletes win even more medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lots of people in our system who say we are operating on four out of six cylinders at the moment, so there are definitely improvement to be made,\u201d she said, before setting a target of 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals, a figure she said did not include professional sports such as tennis, or new Olympic sports such as surfing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
