But when Venus and Serena Williams are at the top of their game they are pretty much unbeatable, except by each other. So it is very hard to see anything other than them meeting in the final here on Saturday week. Both had unconventional pathways to get where they are but they have plenty in common with some of the great players of the past: they are very competitive, want to learn and are diligent students of the game. All this is wrapped up in a physical package which is outstanding: they are intimidating, tall and strong. They are powerful from all the major areas but also move better than anyone in women's tennis. Power and speed is a deadly combination and if their game is operating with some control it really is tough to break them. There are players who can beat them, but when they are at their best their opponents have to play a near perfect match. It is amazing they have come so far. If you go to Compton you realise that few grow up there without difficulties and temptations; there are many opportunities to go off the rails. But they had parents with a vision which they embraced wholeheartedly. If Venus and Serena hadn't been fully committed to tennis there would have been some major backfire along the way, some hiccup or rebellion, but to me they just look like they love what they are doing. It is important, though, to differentiate between them and remember they are different personalities with different games. It is even possible that Serena will end up the better player, because her game has fewer technical flaws. She is younger, and therefore still maturing. But most importantly she's had this great role model in Venus, who is her best friend, room-mate and doubles partner. There is a fear that their domination will make people lose interest and, let's face it, when they play each other in a final there's not that crowd-pleasing conflict found between two fierce rivals. If they end up playing each other in most of the majors and the matches don't get more intriguing then it could be a problem. The jury's still out on that one. But it is understandable that there is an awkwardness when they face each other. When playing other people they're very clear in what they want to do and are 100% focused on winning. When they step out against each other they try to have that same attitude but I think it's impossible for them. It's happened before when, say, doubles players who are good friends have met in singles, but this is that instance multiplied by 10. This is a unique situation and no one in our sport can understand what they're going through, especially because it's not like they're playing each other in the first round; being the best two players in the world means that they will only meet in finals and this makes their situation a totally different ball game. But they're finding their feet more and more. Their father is apparently not here this year and they are discovering a natural independence which will help people think less and less that their matches are being manipulated. This issue proves a huge psychological barrier for them. Their increased maturity is shown in that they're both becoming more able in dealing with the public duties that go with their position. When players are young they can sometimes put their foot in it without even knowing it. Both Venus and Serena can sound a bit too cocky, but they've learnt about that. They also have learnt to deal with people complaining that they don't play enough tournaments and that they should get a proper coach. But what if these two have a long career at the top of their game, win more majors, have a balanced life with interest in other areas and leave the sport without getting totally fed up with it, as most of us do at some point? Given where they are now, it is difficult to say they should have done anything differently. Of the other contenders, it was not good for the draw to lose two past winners in the shape of Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis. If they were here and both playing well it would bring a whole new dimension to the tournament. You need the Belgians Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters to play well. Jelena Dokic likes playing here, but Monica Seles is never going to get there on grass. The main contender must be Jennifer Capriati. She has won more matches in majors in the past 18 months than anyone else and if she is in a positive frame of mind and is rested she will do well. But you wonder if any of them can maintain the necessary level to challenge the Williams sisters. Just look at the overall picture: they occupy the top two spots in the world, Serena has won two majors and Venus four. You tell me another story in the history of our sport which is more fascinating than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
