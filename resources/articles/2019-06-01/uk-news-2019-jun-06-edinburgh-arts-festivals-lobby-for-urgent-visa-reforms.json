Nick Barley, the director of the Edinburgh international book festival, said there was concern that performers from the EU would face the same visa restrictions as artists from the Middle East, Africa and south Asia. A dozen authors due to take part in last year\u2019s festival were denied visas, including the Palestinian writer Nayrouz Qarmout who was refused entry three times before the Home Office eventually relented. Some were told they had too much money and others not enough. This year\u2019s festival is due to feature more than 900 participants from 65 countries \u2013 the largest number yet, but Barley said it was unclear at this stage whether all those invited would get visas. Its most prominent guests this year include Salman Rushdie, Thomas Keneally and Arundhati Roy. Festivals Edinburgh, the umbrella body for 11 of the city\u2019s arts and cultural festivals, met Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, in London on Wednesday to lobby for more flexibility. Julia Amour, the director of Festivals Edinburgh, said after the meeting: \u201cComplex visa rules [can] deter artists from accepting our invitations and threaten the free flow of culture and ideas at a time when the country needs to be even more globally engaged.\u201d Barley said there was a pressing need to change policy both to support this year\u2019s festivals and to avoid the problem spreading. \u201cThis is about culture in Britain as a whole,\u201d he said.\u201cAfter Brexit our major concern is that this might begin to affect authors within Europe and therefore there\u2019s an urgent need to sort this out, not just in order to make sure we can get visas sorted out for authors from the Middle East, Africa, Palestine and so on.\u201d Rushdie, making his fifth appearance at the Edinburgh book festival, is launching his latest book Quichotte, a US-based reworking of Don Quixote, while Roy will be interviewed by Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, on her first appearance at the event. Barley said internationalism was the key unifying theme of this year\u2019s festival. One of three guest selectors this year will be is DeRay Mckesson, a leading voice in the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. There will be a strong focus on indigenous languages and cultural exchange, featuring Sami from Lapland, Basques from Spain and Inuit poets, while Carrie Gracie, the former BBC News China editor who quit over pay discrimination, launches her new book, Equal, at the festival. Jokha Alharthi, the Omani author who won the 2019 Man Booker International prize for Celestial Bodies, will also talk in a late addition to the programme. At last year\u2019s book festival Barley met David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, to discuss the issue. The British Council, the government-funded agency that promotes international cultural exchange, has become involved and has lobbied for changes. The Home Office said Nokes was meeting numerous arts organisations including Festivals Edinburgh as part of the government\u2019s work on a new skills-based immigration system post-Brexit. A spokesman did not respond to the criticism of the current system but said: \u201cWe welcome artists and performers coming to the UK to perform, and appreciate the important contribution they make to our creative sector.\u201d Barley signed a letter to the Guardian last year along with the directors of Womad, the Hay literature festival, Sheffield Doc/Fest, Manchester international festival and Bradford literary festival calling for reform of the \u201coverly complex\u201d system. After three acts were unable to perform at Womad last year because of visa problems, the festival\u2019s founder, Peter Gabriel, said: \u201cDo we really want a white-breaded Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?\u201d Womad and the Edinburgh Fringe are among 45 arts festivals on an approved government list that is intended to provide for visitor visas, but complications still arise. Barley has previously called for a \u201ccultural passport\u201d allowing artists greater freedom to visit the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
