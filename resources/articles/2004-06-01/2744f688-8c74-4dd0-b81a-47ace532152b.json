My home grown favourite is 123domainname.co.uk. It's the pure pain, sweat and tears that went into it. I like it because it was the one thing that turned my business into a real business. And because it's orange. It makes money while I sleep. It's mainly corporate stuff, but we get newlyweds who register each other's names as a little website. Last online purchase? I have just bought a baby grand piano for my new house, from colbecks-music.com. I have been buying little bits for my Jag on the main Jaguar site. I'm the youngest owner of an XK8 in Britain. I'm not even materialistic but when I was growing up that was the symbol of success. Now I keep looking out the window and saying: \"Oh my God! It's still there!\" Ever begun a relationship online? Three years ago I tried to auction my hand in marriage on the internet. It was blown up in the media and you can't have a relationship with a crowd. So I walked away from it. Since then the business has grown so that I don't have enough time to get my beauty sleep, as shown from my face today. There is so much stuff I know I am missing out on, but relationships are bottom of the list. Main source of news online? The Guardian Media section, the FT.com and the Richard Littlejohn column in the Sun. That's where I get my politics from. Least useful website? dolcegabbana.it. It's a gorgeous website and I'm a huge buyer of Dolce and Gabbana's couture stuff, but you can't buy it online. It's so frustrating - they would make a fortune out of me. I have five pairs of Gucci sunglasses in the office alone. I've had a special cupboard built to house my 200 shoes and counting. What sort of online business is least likely to succeed? People often see their websites as personal but it should not be personal to the owner but to the viewer. It's one of the quickest ways to turn round a failing website. It sounds simple but there is a pride thing involved. Do you still bother with old media? Because I'm moving I'm reading House &amp; Garden and all the interior magazines. Now it's just the final touches. The sleigh beds. They are four grand each. The cost is spiralling out of control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
