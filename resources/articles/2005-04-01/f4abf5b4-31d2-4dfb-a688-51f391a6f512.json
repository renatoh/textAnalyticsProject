Looking at the place now, it's easy to see why she's so enthusiastic - the richly coloured interior (colour is one of the chief characteristics of Grellier's work) is both vintage and eclectic to its core, while the exterior is everything a Cotswolds country pad should be: old, rambling and the colour of honey. Rewind four years, though, and only the most dedicated home-improver would have shared her passion. The place was a mess: dark, dirty and still laid out as two separate cottages. \"It was a wilderness inside and out,\" says Grellier, 39, \"but I bought it because I knew it would be an incredible place to bring up the kids [Nettle, 11, Florence, 10, and Harley, eight]. It's on the edge of a village, with an acre of fantastic, magical garden. The builders moved in, knocked it into one, changed some rooms about, and then I started decorating.\" And she hasn't stopped since. While most of us think of decorating as a chore to be undertaken as rarely as possible, Grellier finds it a regular pleasure. Given a free weekend, she's more likely to repaint the sitting room than check into a spa. Why? Because, for her, painting and playing around with her living environment is \"just another form of being an artist\". What the house will look like in a few months is anybody's guess (including Grellier's: planned schemes are not what she's about), but right now it's pretty high fashion stuff, so we thought we'd steal a few of her ideas for our own places. Customise old junk Why? Because it's cheap, green (you're recycling, don't forget) and deeply satisfying. How? Scour car-boot sales and charity shops for junk with potential, then spend an evening sewing on beautiful trimmings and ribbons. If your sewing's not up to much, use glue or a staple gun instead. Where to buy Grellier picked up a floor lamp and shade for \u00a32 at the local WI stall. Do something different with the doors Why? Because standard doors take up a lot of space that could be used for other things. How? Grellier got her builder to saw the original kitchen door in half so that when it's open (which is most of the time) each side sits flat against the wall. The doors are kept closed with a simple hook. (\"I like the jangly sound when you move them,\" Grellier says.) If sleek modern is more your taste, then go for sliding doors. Where to buy For old doors, try salvage yards such as London's Lassco Warehouse, 020-7394 2103 (lassco.co.uk); for a directory of salvage yards across the UK, check out salvo.co.uk. Always check the doors are not bowed before buying them and, if they've been stripped, that the joints are still sound (the chemicals used to strip paint can also damage the glue in the joints). For new sliding doors, try Duvale plc, 0870 872 0873 (duvale.plc.uk). Tel 0207 206 1000 feburman.com Ditch the floor coverings and get painting Why? It's cheap, practical and easy to change when you get bored. How? Preparation and quality paint are the keys. Underneath two coats of specialist floor paint (yes, it does come in pretty colours) are two layers of aluminium paint to seal the wood. Grellier has also painted the concrete floors in the kitchen and bathroom (again in groovy colours); unlike wood, concrete doesn't need sealing. Where to buy Most decent paint companies stock floor paint, but if you want interesting colours, you'll have to have it mixed for you. Try Ray Munn, 020-7736 9876 (raymunn.com). Use old furniture and open shelves in the kitchen Why? You can take it all with you when you move. Plus wall units can make a room look cramped. How? Kitchens need plenty of storage, so look for furniture with lots of drawers and/or shelves. If you plan to use the top of the furniture as a work surface, make sure it's the right height and something you can keep clean. Where to buy This wooden chest came from a local market, but if you can't face trawling around, try the French House, 0870 901 4547 (thefrenchhouse.net), or Baileys Home And Garden, 01989 561931 (baileyshomeandgarden.com), for shabby chic gear by post. Make the most of your landings Why? Because most of us need all the space we can get in our homes. How? Big landings make good workspaces - especially if there's a window with a bit of a view. Line long, thin landings with bookshelves and turn them into mini libraries. Where to buy Go to Ikea for cheap and flat-pack (0845 355 1141; ikea.co.uk); Habitat for something trendy (0845 601 0740; habitat.net); and Vitra for top-end swank (020- 7608 6200; vitra.com). \u00b7 To view artwork by Nicola Grellier, go to nicolagrellier.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
