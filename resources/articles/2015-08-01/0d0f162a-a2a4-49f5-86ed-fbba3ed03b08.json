The blue chip index hit a new seven-month low of 6,367 points, down 0.5% on the previous close and into its longest losing run since 2011. It has lost more than 10% from its record closing high of 7,104 points set in April. The collapse in stock values of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies came after China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai index slumped 3.4% on heavy selling of energy and property companies. Oil prices tumbled, with North Sea Brent down 0.5% to $46.96 a barrel. Bourses lost ground across Europe, while in New York the Dow Jones closed 358 points, or 2.1%, down at 16,990.69 \u2013 its lowest since October 2014. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the London stock market remained vulnerable to further shocks. \u201cThe decline and underperformance of the FTSE 100 has not reflected building concerns about the UK\u2019s economic outlook, but rather the impact of recent events in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FTSE 100 comprises to a greater extent than most \u2026 commodity producers that are particularly dependent on demand from China.\u201d Analysts said anxiety over the threat to emerging economies of China\u2019s slowdown, and the prospect of higher interest rates in the US \u2013 where many emerging economies have borrowed money \u2013 were sapping investor confidence around the world. Stock markets have now been dropping for several weeks as investors have become increasingly edgy that the world economy was entering a stickier patch. Federal Reserve minutes released on Wednesday showed that the US central bank had concerns over events in China, as well as the strength of the US dollar and the weakness of domestic inflation. The state of the Chinese economy is now centre-stage. The news that the Shanghai stock index had tumbled reignited fears it would repeat a nerve-jangling crash in June when the Beijing authorities were forced to intervene to prevent a rout. The Shanghai Composite Index is down about 7% since China devalued its currency last week, and the wild ride of Chinese shares has raised uncertainty about Beijing\u2019s ability to stabilise the market a second time. Conner Campbell, of spread betting firm SpreadEX, said:\u201cFor such a long time Greece was the market-moving force, be that positive or negative; now, despite a deal being signed, sealed and delivered, something that has happened against pretty formidable odds, investors have been infected with a fear over China that is outweighing any other [non-interest rate-related] news. \u201cAnother tumble by the Shanghai Composite merely reinforced the idea that the Chinese government is struggling to provide a tourniquet for its headline index, and caused the markets to open to more widespread losses after the bell.\u201d In a further sign of the change of mood in China, market researchers Gartner said quarterly smartphone sales in the country had fallen for the first time. The return of low oil prices was widely seen by analysts as a signal of weakness in the world economy. Weak demand from China and much of south-east Asia has pushed down futures prices. Data released on Wednesday had shown that oversupply from fracking wells in the US mid-west and from Opec producers meant the US was holding more oil in its commercial stockpiles. There were also fresh tensions in emerging markets. China\u2019s devaluation has caused other countries to in turn devalue their own currencies, notably Kazakhstan and Vietnam. Kazakhstan\u2019s currency, the tenge, slumped by about 25% after the country announced plans to allow its currency to float freely. The Turkish lira also dropped 1% to a historical low against the dollar. Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said that while falling oil prices indicated weakening global demand and would hit oil- and commodity-producing countries, lower energy costs would eventually boost global growth. He said: \u201cLower oil prices, whatever the cause, may be negative for global growth in the short term if producers [the losers] adjust their spending more quickly than consumers [the winners], and if the falls contribute to uncertainty in financial markets. \u201cBut over time, lower oil prices should still be a net positive for aggregate demand and economic activity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
