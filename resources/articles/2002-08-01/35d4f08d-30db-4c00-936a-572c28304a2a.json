As any good South African knows, \"Witblits\" (White Lightning) is Afrikaans for a potent colourless alcoholic brew, the effects of which can be gauged from the name. Read the ironic, deadpan tales of Herman Charles Bosman to appreciate the full tragi-comic effects on the Afrikaner psyche. I am sure Cartwright is paying some sort of homage to Bosman. Linda Dippenaar Calvey Northampton Arrogant agents Andrew Cowan's problem in trying to get an agent to read his work (Paperback writer, August 10) was exceptional only in that he stumbled on a way round it. Why isn't there in the whole Association of Authors' Agents just one member who does not react to unknown writing as to some particularly malignant strain of the ebola virus? Why isn't there just one with faith in his judgment and confidence in his knowledge of the market to consider new writing seriously - at double or even triple his usual commission rate for a first successful deal? He might make a fortune and wake up a few arrogant sleepyheads currently occupying space in The Writer's Handbook. James Leigh Ripon Bring back Angelique Elaine Showalter's rereading of Forever Amber (August 10) brought back memories. How I loved that generous, sexy heroine! I'm an ex-librarian and I remember a librarian from the Mission to Seamen saying that it was the most popular historical novel on board, and always fell open at certain pages... But whatever happened to the novels about that other blonde, voluptuous and feisty heroine, Angelique (by Sergeanne Golon - husband-and-wife team Serge and Anne, I believe)? She, too, married into the nobility; fell into poverty; consorted with beggars and bandits; and flirted with a king. Ever since I read Angelique in Love (at boarding school, aged about 17) I wanted to visit the Langue d'Oc. And now, about to fulfil that teenage dream, I find the books are out of print. The role of historical novels in awakening the reader's interest in other times and places is surely much under-estimated: everything I learned about European history came from Jean Plaidy. Surely it's time for an Angelique revival. Jane Little London A voice silenced Further to the letter (August 10) concerning the death of Isaac Babel, many years after his arrest and disappearance it was disclosed that he did not die in a Siberian concentration camp, but was murdered in Lubianka prison in Moscow 1940. His last request, denied by the regime, was to finish the manuscript he was working on. Thus the Soviet Union silenced one of the greatest voices in 20th-century fiction, and one of the greatest Jewish voices. Linda Grant London 'Mary had a little trochee' James Fenton's remarks on the trochee (August 10) reminded me that once, in my teaching days, I was at a loss to recall an example of a trochaic line. The only one I could come up with was the first line of \"Mary had a little lamb.\" Oddly enough, the rest of the poem isin iambics. Alan Myers Hitchin The prolific professor I was interested to read Professor Mark Griffiths' confession (Letters, August 10) that he was a collector (I knew he was a psychologist). I wonder if he hoards his own cuttings? If so, he must have a house full of paper to add to his stamps, postcards, books etc, because whenever I read a paper, magazine or journal, there he is. For those who wish to add to their Professor Griffiths cutting collection, he was also to be found quoted on the same day in the main section of the Guardian (Labour's big gamble on casino debts, page 3). Dr Rachel Bromnick Lincoln Poetry of the sea I've never once been round Cape Horn (Hugh Lewellyn Davies, letters, August 10), but find \"hauling out the mizzen on the larboard bow\" a bit less Navy Lark than \"putting up the sail on the left of the third mast from the front of the ship\" - and much more poetic. Colin Hall Dundee Bugger, it's French Why must Robert Potts perpetuate the tired old myth that all \"blunt\" words (as he calls them) are Anglo-Saxon (The praise singer, August 10)? We may thank our French neighbours for most of them, including \"bugger\", from Old French bougre , \"heretic\", \"sodomite\".
