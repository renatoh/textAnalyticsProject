Around two and a half hours' drive from Glasgow, it's the nearest place providing nurse training to anyone living in this beautiful but isolated part of Scotland. Having worked for several years as a nursing assistant at an acute unit at Campbeltown hospital, James O'May, 34, knew he wanted to make the leap to become a fully qualified nurse. \"I'd done an SVQ level 3 in health and social care, which was the first time I started applying theory to my practice,\" he says. \"I realised it gave me a lot more job satisfaction.\" But with three young children, the time and cost involved in studying so far from home meant he knew that, for now at least, the dream would have to wait. \"Then the nursing programme co-ordinator for the Open University (OU) came to Campbeltown to tell us about this distance learning course, and two of my colleagues signed up,\" O'May explains. The course allows students to complete their entire pre-registration nursing studies through distance learning and on a part-time basis if required. While there are a few other institutions that offer some elements of distance-learning nursing programmes, the OU is the only one that offers the whole course this way. Hearing good feedback, O'May also enrolled two years later. Four years on, he has just passed his exams, and once his registration comes through he'll start working as a nurse, with the salary and prospects to match. O'May and his family have benefited from an arrangement whereby healthcare assistants, healthcare support workers and nursing assistants living in remote locations not only have their OU course fees paid, but remain employed in their original job and so also receive their full salary while they retrain. Students qualify with a diploma of higher education in either adult or mental-health nursing and are guaranteed a job in nursing. This is clearly not a cheap option, so why not just recruit qualified nurses from outside the region? Getting skilled professionals to relocate to remote areas tends to be tricky, while getting them to stay is even harder. \"It means we have the ability to recruit suitable healthcare support workers who are committed to the area to become registered nurses,\" says Pat Tyrrell, lead nurse for Argyll and Bute Community Health Partnership, \"and it improves retention of these staff as they are already living here and many of them are local people.\" On Jersey, which has similar arrangements to support healthcare staff wanting to become nurses, Rose Naylor, director of nursing and governance, points out that since 1997, when the last student nurses qualified on the island, anyone with nursing ambitions has had to decamp to an English university. Many who would otherwise be keen on nursing as a career don't find it easy to make the move. Katie Hooton, 25, is one of them. \"I did my first year of A-levels, but didn't do so well in my exams and didn't want to redo the year,\" she explains. \"My careers officer thought I could get on to the nursing diploma course with my GCSEs, but that was only available off the island at that point. I did look at going away, but Jersey won't fund the diploma, just the nursing degree, off the island. And I'd already got a job a soon as I'd left school, as a healthcare assistant. \"It would have bothered me to go to the mainland, because I was happy \u2013 I like living here, it's where I'm from.\" So in 2004 Jersey started offering remote training for nurses. \"It gives Jersey an opportunity to grow its own workforce, rather than having to be totally reliant on recruiting off-island,\" Naylor says. \"It also means people can stay on the island, who don't want to leave and who are currently in low-skilled jobs, plus it's a real opportunity for local people to care for people in their own community.\" Hooton leapt at the chance, and is now a qualified nurse. Like Hooton, Lee Turner, 46, is exactly the kind of person Jersey's nursing programme is designed to recruit. Turner was a healthcare assistant on the island for 11 years before taking the opportunity to retrain. With two children, he says funding the course and going off-island to study would have been impossible practically and financially. But staying in Jersey enabled Turner to juggle study and family commitments. \"We'd work three days of the week on placement and then two days were study days,\" he says. With a course like nursing, however, which has significant practical elements, how well can a distance-learning course replicate the experience of a university or college setting? For O'May, Campbeltown's small hospital couldn't provide all the practical experience he needed, so he did have to spend short stretches away from home completing placements in Oban and Paisley. In Jersey, however, it's only the academic side that's not available locally \u2013 practical placements are on the doorstep. \"Students do all their practical training on the island,\" explains Naylor. \"We have an ITU, children's, maternity, surgical theatres and mental-health services, an acute in-patient unit, community nursing and so on.\" O'May, Turner and Hooton all agree that the self-directed learning of the theory element was the hardest part. \"I won't lie, it was hard work, and you have be self-motivating,\" says Hooton. \"Time management had to be good, and I don't have children, but even so, when I was at home I'd get distracted so I'd go to the library to study.\" \"It was a strain at times, and quite stressful, yes,\" agrees Turner. \"I didn't have a very good time at school, I'm more of a practical chap. All of a sudden I had to start writing academically, and it was a skill I had to develop. It did get easier. In the first year, the tutor I had was very critical, but that did help, so it was a good thing. \"But for the first two years, every Saturday up to 2pm I'd study just so I could keep myself ahead. I wasn't willing to waste those years and fail.\" The quality and consistency of support provided on distance-learning programmes is crucial to minimise dropout rates. On the OU nursing course, students are assigned a tutor for each module they take, while another supports individual students throughout their four-year period of study. OU-trained personal mentors, typically a registered nurse, support and assess students in the workplace. \"The workbooks direct your learning, but you got a tutorial every month by video link. We also met our tutor face-to-face once a month with the rest of the group,\" says O'May. \"There were also phone tutorials, emails and online forums. It worked fantastically well.\" From 2012, the OU will offer nursing degrees as part of the government's policy to make nursing training degree-standard. But entry criteria will remain the same so that healthcare workers seconded by their employers are still able to study for the degree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
