In the 80s, it seemed a sensible idea; media images of black people were rare and almost always negative. If only they showed more of our real lives, we would argue, it might help break down the barriers holding us back. Well, as they say, be careful what you wish for. Today images of black people are far more frequent - but there's little doubt that this increase has moved us backwards. To the despair of many in the community, images of gun crime, fuelled by the multibillion-dollar gangsta-rap industry and aimed directly at our children, have overwhelmed all others. Whether in this decade or the 80s, the powers controlling the media have their own idea of what our \"real lives\" are, and little interest in the impact of their work on marginalised minorities. Their \"Black Crime Shock\" message of two decades ago has simply transformed into the \"Black Crime Cool\" of today. So it was extremely depressing to see that last week's publication of a year-long study into the aspirations and attainment of black youngsters made as its main recommendation the futile call for more \"positive black role models\". How can the occasional image of a doctor or engineer, a lawyer or accountant, neutralise the constant negative coverage beamed out by the music shows on radio and TV, including 24-hour hip-hop video channels? Of course we want more positive black images, and fairer coverage of our communities, but the entrenched problems of Britain's black population will never be resolved by waiting for a change of heart from media moguls. They see that there's money to be made from exploiting and exaggerating the most negative images of us; and, short of the government stepping in to ban such output (would it ever have the guts to take on those who would cry \"censorship\" or \"political correctness\"?), it can only be assumed that they'll carry on laughing all the way to the bank. You only have to look at the progress of Asians in Britain to see that role models are not the determining factor. In the 80s Asians were also virtually invisible in the media, and tended to be thought of as the stereotypical corner-shop owners. But since then we've seen numerous examples of success in business and the professions, with Asian voices heard regularly in broadcasts on economics, science and politics. Still, these appearances are dwarfed by the deluge of stories about Muslim extremism - but even the terrorists are graduates. Are black people so hopeless we can't forge worthwhile careers without nice TV images to lead us? Racism is still all too apparent in our major institutions. But the way to tackle that is to get inside them and change them - which needs a lot of hard work and determination, not tokenistic gestures from on high. The main role models children have are parents and close family, who give them a set of values and a sense of direction and motivation. If this is done well, then, yes, children may look at people in certain professions and think \"It could be me\", but they may be just as inspired by people not of their race. Who, after all, did Tiger Woods or Lewis Hamilton look up to when they set out on their worldbeating career paths? Jack Nicklaus? Michael Schumacher? Perhaps, but only after the far more influential role of their own fathers, all too often absent from the homes of many black children. The problem with last week's government-funded Reach report, whose group of advisers is dominated by community workers, is that it ignores this core factor in children's lives. It calls for action at central government and local levels, but as for families, it simply passes the buck. It says, for example: \"Some parents find it hard to engage with teachers and schools, and black parents often feel that they face additional barriers, including teacher perceptions and stereotyping of black boys and black families. This leads to them feeling disempowered and disengaged.\" The onus is left solely on the educational services, with no acknowledgement of parents' duty to their children. The report talks of \"the needs of black families\", but not of the needs of teachers, who can do only so much if faced with a child of five who has had little love or care, and whose parents give no time to helping his or her education. Maybe it's time for a JF Kennedy moment: ask not what we parents need of our teachers; ask what our teachers need of us. Allowing parents to feel that their children's problems are all the fault of state providers, as this report does, is a huge own goal. It gives them an excuse for their own inadequacies, and encourages the sense that their child's progress is all someone else's responsibility. Ultimately, if children haven't been taught, from their earliest years, the value of education and the need for hard work, the chances are they will struggle at school. And after a few years, no matter how many doctors they see on TV, or even close up in mentoring schemes, they won't be able to catch up. If the crisis in our community is to be solved, it will be through strengthening the bonds between parents, and between parents and their children. This may indeed require outside support. And the full implications of parenthood must be made clear, so as to discourage teenage pregnancies and the resulting damage to youngsters' life chances. The report is correct, though, to put a figure on the cost of leaving this crisis unresolved - despite their \u00a324bn over 50 years being a huge underestimate. Not only did the researchers exclude children of mixed parentage (most of whom have a black parent, and face the same social crisis); it also ignored the huge white underclass whose children suffer from the same social breakdown. Ultimately the problems in black society reflect the issues faced by the rest of the population - as the murder of Garry Newlove in Warrington last Friday night, by a teenage gang, exemplifies. If we are to solve them properly, and permanently, we have no choice but to solve them together. \u00b7 joseph.harker@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
