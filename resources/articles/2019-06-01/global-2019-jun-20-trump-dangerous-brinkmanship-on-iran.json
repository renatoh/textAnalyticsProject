Its categoric claim that Iran was responsible for last week\u2019s attacks on the two tankers in the Straits of Hormuz has been challenged by the Japanese and the German governments. It has served only to make a dangerous situation more serious. The context to this is Donald Trump\u2019s scrapping of the nuclear deal with Iran last year, which blocked the way to normalising relations and immediately escalated tension. The accompanying sanctions have caused real economic damage and human suffering. In May the Trump administration turned the screw tighter by dropping exemptions for oil exports. These measures are part of the policy of regime change advocated by John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s two senior foreign policy officials, both of whom have called for military attacks on Iran. Rather than falling in line with the Trump administration\u2019s dangerous brinkmanship, the British government should be calling for restraint and de-escalation and explicitly ruling out military options.
