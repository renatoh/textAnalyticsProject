The global body, Fide, now has official world rankings for one-hour rapid games and for 10-minute blitz. This week the Fide world rapid and blitz championships surged to a new level of high-class participants, as a $400,000 prize fund attracted the elite headed by the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, to Dubai. Most major nations were represented in the 15 rapid rounds spread over three days. However, the English Chess Federation omitted to send anyone. In contrast France, our main rivals in western Europe, had three of its best players in Dubai, while Spain, Germany and the Netherlands were also represented by leading grandmasters. Carlsen was seeded only No4 at rapid, and said before the start that he felt \u201cbothered\u201d to be below No1. His top-seeded arch-rival, Hikaru Nakamura of the US, was beaten in the very first round, and by the end of the first day Italy\u2019s Fabiano Caruana had 4.5/5. Caruana used to have a reputation as a poor speed player but realising that rapid and blitz are now major disciplines he worked on it, and this smart fifth-round win put him top of the rankings. Black handles the French Defence 1...e6 with an eccentric knight tour Nc6-e7-d5xc3 and White soon had the better development and a strong attack, yet Black could still have held with 21...Qg6! ready to meet 22 Rf3 by f5. As played, Caruana\u2019s 23 Rxd8+! led to a mating attack and at the end Black resigned in view of Kb6 27 Rb3+ Ka5 28 Qd2+ Ka4 29 Qb4 mate.

In round 12 he blundered a piece and lost to the former champion Vishy Anand, but then he recovered and took the world rapid crown with 11/15. On Friday, Carlsen also took first place in the world blitz with 17/21, thus capturing the chess triple crown for a historic achievement. 3363 1...Rc4 2 bxc4 c2 3 Rxc6+ Ka5 (if Bb6 4 Bf4 or if Kb7 4 Nd8+ Ka8 5 Rc8 mate) 4 Be1+!
