Not one word of apology came from the lips of the minister for children yesterday. Her disgraceful slur against a man at the centre of a child abuse scandal goes uncorrected. For that alone, any minister would deserve the sack. Hodge is hanging onto her job by a thread. To incompetence, hypocrisy, arrogance and untruthfulness we must add the charge of rank bad manners. Hodge should be shot. The Daily Mirror, leader, November 13: Margaret Hodge is damaged goods as children's minister. When she was leader of Islington council she refused to consider evidence of abuse in children's homes. Now she says that taught her important lessons she can use in her new job. But she clearly hasn't learnt everything. She smeared one of the victims whose story was being investigated by the BBC and tried to get the director general to stop it being broadcast. The criticism of Margaret Hodge is not going to go away. She should stand down before more damage is done. The Independent, leader, November 13: Margaret Hodge's position as minister for children is untenable. She was a stunningly insensitive choice for such a sensitive role. Even if the current round of controversy were to be resolved in Ms Hodge's favour, the scale of abuse in Islington care homes was such that it would only be a matter of time before the minister found herself embroiled in a fresh set of claims. Whatever she decides to do, or Mr Blair decides for her, it is wrong that someone with her history holds such a symbolically important position. Melanie Phillips, the Daily Mail, November 12: Margaret Hodge has been caught out in a flagrant abuse of her position. Through her own behaviour she has made her ministerial position completely untenable. It is an insult to the children who were abused in her care. It is an insult to the staff of Islington council, whom she has wronged. The prime minister must now sack Margaret Hodge without further ado, before outrage and disgust at her turns into contempt for his weakness in the face of a grotesque abuse of power. Telegraph, leader, November 13: Mr Panton is reportedly considering suing the minister. Even if the case never comes to court, Mrs Hodge emerges as an unworthy figure, having added insult to injury in order to discredit a witness of good character. A minister who has lost the confidence of the public has no choice but to resign. Margaret Hodge is such a minister. It appears that she lacks the tact to recognise that her letter to the BBC was an error of judgement that has now made her position impossible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
