If there was ever a time to be a literary translator, it is now. UK sales of translated fiction grew last year by 5.5%, while the Booker International Prize is as much a feature of the literary calendar as the Booker itself. In this inspiring masterclass with Thomas Bunstead, you will learn not only how to translate Spanish-language texts but also what sets great literary translation apart. You will be shown ways of analysing the Spanish original, and then assessing the creative options at your disposal in English, gaining a real insight into the nitty-gritty of this art. Thomas is one of the most celebrated translators of Spanish-language novels currently at work, and in his collaborative creative writing class with a twist, you will be shown how to harness your love of language by putting it into practice. Take advantage of this multilingual moment and see your practice anew in a class that celebrates your skills as both reader and writer, and enables you to enjoy the beauty of languages and the ways they interact.
