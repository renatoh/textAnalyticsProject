So goes the familiar refrain. But for Ajmal Shahzad, who is in the running for an England 50-over debut against Bangladesh on Sunday, the caricature could not be more misleading. Here is a fast bowler desperate to learn. Shahzad has settled into his first England tour respectfully, as one must, but it will not be too long before his pungent Bradford accent booms out around Bangladesh, as powerfully and exuberantly as Darren Gough once exported Barnsley's vowel sounds to the cricketing world. His last chance to press his claims to face Bangladesh in the opening one-day international on Sunday comes tomorrow in a final warm-up match against a Board XI in Fatullah. And when he is not playing, or talking, both of which he does rather well, he is listening. In Dubai last week, during England's two Twenty20s against Pakistan, he heard that Waqar Younis, a great Pakistani pioneer of reverse swing, was in the commentary box, and he immediately arranged a meeting and asked him about the secret. It is a technique that in Bangladesh, where the ball is soon roughed up by abrasive pitches and concrete boundary boards, he wants to add to his repertoire. With an ability to bowl in the high 80s, he has the pace to do it. \"I know I can swing the red ball away and in,\" he says. \"But, as regards to reverse swing, I've never consciously done it. I know what I need to do. It swung a bit for me in the nets. If I can get a bit of reverse swing going on tour it's going to help me.\" Cricket is a great fraternity. The past masters are mostly eager to share their knowledge. More often than not, irrespective of national loyalties, if you ask, you get \u2013 although some Yorkshiremen of past vintage did not exactly make a habit of it. It is Shahzad's passionate desire to learn that has influenced England's decision to take a punt on him in Bangladesh. He is shrewd enough to know that his more natural tutor would probably be Wasim Akram, who like Shahzad lacked the slingy action often seen with the best proponents of reverse swing. When his agent, Neil Fairbrother, turned up in Dubai, Shahzad asked if he could arrange a chat with Wasim back in Lancashire in the summer. \"Apart from Wasim, most of the top reverse-swing bowlers are a bit more slingy, but I'm more straight arm,\" he says. \"I still watch Wasim today on YouTube.\" Watching Wasim on YouTube on a Dhaka wi-fi connection when a passing storm is causing repeated power cuts \u2013 there must be easier ways of doing your homework. Give this lad some footage. Shahzad's England debut in a Twenty20 international against Pakistan was a rollercoaster affair. His first ball was smashed for four, he then took two wickets in the rest of his first over, but conceded 17 in his last over, destroyed by Abdul Razzaq, as England lost with an over to spare. Razzaq is one of the most explosive hitters in the game; Shahzad tried to fool him with a slower leg-spinner and it has probably not come down yet. \"If I get a chance on Sunday I hope to put the memories of my Twenty20 debut to bed,\" he says. \"I bowled the slower ball in the nets three times yesterday and it gripped and turned and did what I wanted it to do. What the one to Razzaq did was top-spin and he waited and waited and then he smashed it. What I need to do is execute my skills a little better. Maybe I should have considered a leg-stump yorker instead, but I was up against one of the best smashers in the game. \"I used to say to Steve Oldham [Yorkshire's bowling coach]: 'This slower-ball leg-spinner works for me, I've got decent wrists, you know what, if this grips and turns it's a difficult ball to hit.' I'd definitely bowl it again.\" Now that was a stubborn conclusion worthy of the county that raised him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
