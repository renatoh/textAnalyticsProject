More than 400 products have been recalled so far after they were found to contain the banned red dye, which is normally used in non-food products. Its detection in food has caused alerts in 15 countries. The UK firm at the centre of the scare, Premier Foods, today announced that two Branston products, the 310g Hot and Spicy Sweet Pickle and 250g Rich and Fruity Sauce, had been added to the list of contaminated foods distributed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The firm said the items were retail products, not ingredients, and \"no other Branston products are affected\". Shops and food companies were given until this morning to identify all products containing Sudan I, the FSA said. Firms that did not meet the deadline faced prosecution. Local authorities are checking that potentially affected foods supplied to schools and hospitals by two catering companies have been withdrawn. The caterers, 3663 and Brakes, which also hold large pub and restaurant contracts, say they have recalled the products concerned. The alert was sparked when a consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce, made by Premier Foods, was found to contain chilli powder contaminated by Sudan 1. The dye is normally used as a colouring in solvents, oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polish. Experts warn it could increase the risk of cancer. The FSA said yesterday Premier Foods was obliged to ensure any contaminated foods in the catering sector were withdrawn. The FSA advised hospital trusts to contact their individual food suppliers for information about their use of Sudan 1. Many hospitals buy food through the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency, which is contacting all its suppliers and publishing details of any contaminated products on its website. Food companies in the US, Canada, Ireland, France, Denmark, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, the Caribbean, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Cyprus and Malta were among the 186 firms listed by Premier Foods as buyers of its Worcester sauce. Some 120,000 bottles of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester sauce are being withdrawn in the US and Canada. A spokeswoman for Premier Foods said the firm was \"taking the matter incredibly seriously ... [but] not making any further comment at the moment\". Meanwhile, Ashok Joshi, the director of EW Spice, the company that imported the chilli powder, which was then sold on through two other firms to Premier, broke his silence today. Mr Joshi, 67 said he was saddened by the food scare and admitted there was a \"claim\" against his Leicester-based business relating to the current recalls. But he said he wanted to get advice from his insurers before releasing a written statement. Speaking at his home in Stoneygate, Leicestershire, from which he runs the company, he said: \"I would like to tell my side of the story ... What happened is very sad. That is all I can say. Something went wrong, and I want to clarify it.\" Mr Joshi's company bought contaminated powder from the Indian firm Gautam Export Corporation in 2002 and sold it to East Anglian Food Ingredients (EAFI), based in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. EAFI sold the substance to other food companies, leading to the recall of 250 products two years ago. The firm had to pay \u00a3360,000 in compensation to its customers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
