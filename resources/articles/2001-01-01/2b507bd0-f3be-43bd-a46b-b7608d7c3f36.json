This ancient saw was given a fresh and whimsical twist when Middlesbrough's Noel Whelan, confronting his old Sky Blue team-mates, scored for rather than against them. Unhappily for the 26-year-old, who left Highfield Road over the summer, his was not one of those deflected or fumbled own-goals that are quickly forgotten but the kind of self-destructive scorcher that will feature on football blooper videos for centuries. To make matters worse it was his birthday. \"At least we can still say that the opposition haven't scored against us,\" Terry Venables quipped afterwards. If the Boro head coach was joking through gritted teeth that was perhaps unsurprising, because until Whelan's brainstorm Venables's side had had much the better of a poor first half. Instrumental in most of the home side's best moments was Christian Karambeu. Playing wide on the right and pushed further forward than he was when Bryan Robson was in sole charge of the team, the Frenchman appeared revitalised. Gone was the irritating tendency to greet every successful five-yard pass by rocking back on his heels as if awaiting a standing ovation; instead, industry accompanied his fancy touches. On a freezing afternoon evidence of the effect of his endeavours on his body temperature came after 25 minutes when he removed his black gloves and tossed them to a nearby steward. Karambeu began the move that led to Boro's best chance of the half, when in the 12th minute he flicked the ball to Hamilton Ricard on the edge of the Coventry 18-yard area. The burly Colombian's shot was deflected and fell, inevitably perhaps, into the path of Whelan. The angle was narrow but the Leeds-born striker's low drive was goalbound until Barry Quinn slid across from the left and somehow scrambled it off the line. If Whelan thought that had used up his supply of ill fortune he was wrong. In the 41st minute Coventry's most influential player, the dapper David Thompson, swung a corner into the Middlesbrough six-yard box and straight to Boro's No26. The ball came to the birthday boy at an awkward height. Unfazed he simply leaned back and cracked a thunderous volley off the outside of his right foot. Possibly stunned by the venom of the strike, Mark Schwarzer collapsed to the floor as if struck with a shovel and could only watch as it crashed into the top corner. With Coventry's travelling fans sarcastically chanting his name Whelan was fired into further misadventure. Latching on to Curtis Fleming's neat ball into the Sky Blues' penalty area he was sent sprawling by a challenge from goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. On another day or for another player Dermot Gallagher might have pointed to the spot instead of waving play on. Frustrated, Whelan began a prolonged bout of chest butting and finger waving with Thompson that carried on after the half-time whistle. The quality of the match improved after the interval, but Whelan's afternoon didn't. Put clear in the 51st minute he shot straight at Kirkland. Fifteen minutes later, when put through by Boro's quietly influential Australian midfielder Paul Okon, he somehow contrived to flick the ball up on to his knee and then smash the rebound into the crowd. The visitors had one good chance to extend their lead when Craig Bellamy latched on to Ysrael Zuniga's impish 20-yard backheel only to shoot hastily from a difficult angle. Then three minutes from the end Alen Boksic showed the teenager, and indeed Whelan, how it should be done when he received the ball in a similar position and drew the keeper before knocking the ball gently into the net to equalise. By then Venables had ended Whelan's misery, replacing him with Brian Deane. The player left the field to ironic cheering from the away section and with his eyes firmly fixed on the ground. \"He was upset because he thought I'd brought him off because of the miss. But I'd already decided to substitute him,\" Venables explained later. Whelan should be grateful for the gesture of mercy. The way his luck was running it was surely only a matter of time before he impaled himself on a corner flag."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
