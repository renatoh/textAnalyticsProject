The Golden Lion pub, in Todmorden, Calderdale, has gained something of a cult following since it was transformed five years ago from a run-down hostelry into a thriving live music venue and community space. But an effort to brighten up the town ahead of the Tour de Yorkshire appears to have backfired. Matthanee Nilavongse, known locally as Gig, and Richard Walker took over Golden Lion Pub in Field Square, in the Upper Calder Valley market town, in 2015. The pair have since transformed it. As well as hosting music acts, it provides a setting for everything from UFO meetings to art classes and has become a pillar of community support during the recent flooding and ongoing coronavirus pandemic, providing free food and drink to residents in need. They say they changed the exterior from white to a canary yellow in anticipation of the planned Tour de Yorkshire passing through, although the event has now been cancelled. But last week, while the painting was still in progress, Gig was shocked to receive a letter from the council threatening the fine and six-month jail term. \u201cThe letter we received told us that we were breaching the law... this was a real shock and we stopped painting straight away,\u201d Gig told Yorkshire live. \u201cWe felt a little sad to receive this, and disappointed, as we\u2019re an organisation that contributes a lot to the town.\u201d The pub owners have since written to Calderdale council\u2019s planning department and more than 1,000 people have signed a petition calling for the building to remain yellow. Gig added: \u201cI understand that we are a listed building, but the building has in fact been orange and pink in the past. We also understand that we are based in a conservation area, so there is a bit of confusion at the moment, but I\u2019m hopeful we can cut through that.\u201d Councillor Jane Scullion said they wrote to the owners of the building, which is Grade II listed, after receiving a complaint and that the council had a duty to investigate alleged breaches of planning control and works to listed buildings. \u201cWe understand the contribution that this venue makes to the cultural and economic life of Todmorden and we would like to work with the owners to achieve a mutually agreeable solution,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
