As the prime minister continues to be observed by doctors, Downing Street said it was too early to say whether he would be staying for another night and did not deny that he had been given oxygen treatment. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said he was in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London and was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d, while continuing to work on his red box of government papers. Asked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman said any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. He still has a cough and a temperature, more than 11 days after first reporting symptoms. No 10 insisted it had been \u201ctransparent throughout\u201d Johnson\u2019s illness, despite having described the prime minister\u2019s symptoms as mild right up until his hospital admission. Johnson himself only admitted to still having a temperature, not a cough, in his video message on Friday morning. No 10 has now changed its description of his symptoms to \u201cpersistent\u201d. Two Tory ministers \u2013 Nadine Dorries and James Duddridge \u2013 have suggested Johnson needs to rest. However, No 10 said he was taking advice from his doctors on whether it was safe for him to continue working and was still in touch with No 10 officials from his hospital bed. Earlier, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted Johnson was fit enough to lead the country from his hospital bed after he was admitted with persistent coronavirus symptoms. Johnson was admitted on Sunday evening with a high fever on the advice of his doctor, with Downing Street saying he was undergoing routine tests. He was kept in overnight. Most coronavirus patients stay in hospital for more than a week. However, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.\u201d If his condition worsens, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab chaired a Monday morning meeting of the government\u2019s C-19 committee, which is leading the response to the pandemic. However, Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting has been cancelled. The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. The prime minister had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street. The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing. But Downing Street flatly denied the prime minister\u2019s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital. Asked if it was time for colleagues in the cabinet and civil service to tell Johnson to rest, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cHe has worked phenomenally hard, as have many people across the country. This has been a uniquely intense period and I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he has had to go to hospital to have these tests. \u201cHe will want to be back in No 10 leading from the front, which is his way. But he remains in charge of the government; he will be updated regularly in hospital, as he has been as he\u2019s self-isolating.\u201d On Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: \u201cHe\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve been talking to him every day, several times a day \u2026 he\u2019s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he\u2019s still got a temperature.\u201d Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also contracted the virus but was recovering. While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would have in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister\u2019s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus. \u201cDoctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,\u201d said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cThey will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.\u201d With Johnson in hospital, the ministers involved in the government\u2019s coronavirus response will be looking ahead to next weekend, which is the point at which it will have to extend or end the lockdown. Jenrick signalled the lockdown was unlikely to be lifted at the end of the week, saying some of the most challenging weeks were probably still to come. As communities secretary, he said the government \u201cdesperately\u201d did not want to shut parks but it could happen if people continued to congregate for picnics. Critics of the government are concerned that ministers have not identified a way out of the lockdown, with doubts about its ability to scale up testing for live cases and the efficacy of new antibody tests to find out whether people have had the virus. The former prime minister Tony Blair called for a senior minister to \u201ctake charge of testing, and nothing else, with people with business experience of how you ramp up industrial scale production\u201d. He said it was not the right choice for an epidemiologist to be in charge of this effort, after the government put Prof John Newton of Public Health England in charge. \u201cUnless you are able to get mass testing at scale, with speed, I don\u2019t see how you can get a way out of this lockdown and I am terrified by the economic damage we are doing with every week this lockdown continues,\u201d Blair told the Today programme. \u201cThis damage is enormous \u2026 If it goes on for a long time then it doesn\u2019t just affect the economy per se, it also affects the ability to operate your healthcare service effectively.\u201d His comments echo the calls of the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has for more than a week advocated a return to mass community testing to suppress virus hotspots where they arise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
