In fact, Moi\u2019s catchphrase was \u201cfuata nyayo\u201d, in kiswahili \u201cfollow the footsteps\u201d, a plea for continuity of the relative prosperity of Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s time in office as president of Kenya. But Moi\u2019s government was certainly a kleptocracy. When I taught in Kenya in the early 1980s, I often found that my monthly government salary had been docked 10% as my contribution to a harambee \u2013 fundraising \u2013initiative by the government. As a consequence, many of my fellow teachers were unable to visit their families that month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
