This has never been true. Newer switch mode power supplies use virtually no energy when passive. I measured the energy used by a Nokia charger identical to the one shown and, while it used 7W when charging, it used less than 1% of this when not charging. Leaving the charger plugged in but not charging a phone, would cost less than 3p a year. There is an easy way to find if power supplies and chargers are using energy while idle - touch them when they are not being actively used. If they are warm, they are wasting energy. If they are cool or cold, then they are not, and switching them off or unplugging them will make very little difference. The same is true of most consumer electronics now. Most items use very little power in standby mode. Again, especially with older appliances, if it is warm when switched off, then it is wasting energy and should be switched off at the plug. Otherwise there is little benefit to be gained by unplugging. Phil Sands via email It is not true that battery chargers consume the same power (energy/sec) plugged or unplugged. It is certainly true that they do draw some current (power = (volts, fixed by mains) x (current)) with no phone etc. Otherwise they would not be warm in this state. But once plugged into the phone batteries, the resistance (or impedance) on the output (phone) side falls and much more current, and therefore power, is drawn. Some of this energy goes usefully into the battery, though the latter also gets warm. If this was not so, bearing in mind that the National Grid supply is always distributed to customers via transformers, there would be no change in demand throughout the day. Tim Searle, department of physics and astronomy, University of Sheffield If you have single glazed windows, the place to put the radiator is under the window. If you put it on the other side of the room, you get a temperature gradient across the room. If you want the room to be 20C when it is 10C outside, you will need 30C on the other side of the room and you will get a nice recirculation going with a cold draught coming down the windows, then across the floor. And if you are not comfortable, you will turn the heating up ... Heavy curtains behind the radiator and draught proofing on old windows will help. If the windows are double-glazed the above doesn't really matter. Michael Tombs, via email Splashing out on the wet stuff No, David Balderston, I don't want the cheapest water, light and heat or rail fare (Letters, October 22). But what I do want is for my money to be spent on maintaining the infrastructure necessary to provide me with good services - not to go into shareholders' dividends or into maintaining share prices, which is where too much of our payments end up. Marcia MacLeod, via email I was surprised to receive my first metered water bill: \u00a366.80 for 66 days (approximately \u00a3370 a year). There are two people in our home and we do not use water excessively. I luckily found out that we are still within the \"cooling-off\" period (one year since installation) and that an unmetered yearly bill for our home should be in the region of \u00a3150 per year. Cathy Wells, Swindon, Wiltshire Is your ID safely deposited? It seemed obvious to me that Ms Wilkinson's dreadful experience (How safe is your bank account, October 22) has all the hallmarks of an inside job. I use my shredder and take all the steps to protect my identity, but I have no faith in my bank to be as careful with my details. The only time my wife and I were victims of an identity crime was when our bank sent out \"balance transfer cheques\", that we had neither requested nor expected, to a completely garbled postal address several weeks after we had urgently corrected the address with the bank. For all the vaunted security systems that the banks tout, customers have learned that a chain of identity security is only as strong as the weakest link. Richard Broughton, Oxfordshire Catching a cold in the gas-free countryside Spare a thought for those of us who heat our homes with oil. Living in a rural area, where villages rarely have a gas supply, the cost of living has been driven up greatly by price increases which have vastly exceeded the Retail Price Index since early 2004. \"Shop around\" is the advice for householders whose homes are heated by gas or electricity, but it is no option for those who rely on heating oil. I was appalled when I recently ordered my usual 500 litres and learned it would cost \u00a3196.61. The same amount in January last year cost me \u00a3122.59.
