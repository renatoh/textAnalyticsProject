India's 304, inspired by a serene century from Sachin Tendulkar, demanded an instant retort and Sangakkara was charged with the responsibility. If 66 from 47 balls was not pinch-hitting, it was a pretty good approximation. Sangakkara's untrammelled strokeplay not only gave Sri Lanka the chance of victory, it released his personal frustration at a career that has temporarily run aground through circumstances not entirely within his control. However poor Sangakkara's form in the Test series, Sri Lanka's recall for Romesh Kaluwitharana as a wicketkeeper-batsman, a move that shunted Sangakkara as low as No9, has been a nonsense. Twice in the past week he has exposed it as such. First there was his considered 70 at Old Trafford, enough to beat England and win the man-of-the-match award. Then there was yesterday's wild-eyed assault: fierce off-side slashes, sashays down the pitch to loft over the bowler's head, neat clips through square. When a left-hander is in this form, no other shots are necessary. Sangakkara was dropped twice, off Ashish Nehra by Tinu Yohannan at mid-on on 13 and again by Mohammad Kaif at cover when 55. But Zaheer and Yohannan were destroyed in turn, and Sourav Ganguly looked like he would be. Then he charged at Harbhajan Singh's second ball and Rahul Dravid stumped him by a distance. At 96 for two in the 13th over, Sri Lanka's belief had been temporarily restored. In keeping with Sri Lanka's desperate summer, it all went wrong after that. Mahela Jayawardene fell reverse-sweeping, the promotion of Nuwan Zoysa failed and Marvan Atapattu and Russel Arnold ran themselves out, Atapattu defeated by Yuvraj Singh's rocket from midwicket. The sensible money is on Sangakkara to become Sri Lanka's next captain, although his rebellious streak remains. When David Shepherd refused his appeal for a catch, Sangakkara held his pose for so long that the game might well have gone on past midnight. India's innings had followed a familiar theme: another skilfully constructed hundred for Tendulkar, his 33rd in 280 one-day internationals. This was one of his more relaxed affairs, 113 from 102 balls, with the precaution of the evening off while he was treated for the slightest of hamstring injuries. If he is unfit for tomorrow's final it will only be because he fell off the physio's bench. At 172 for two in the 28th over, India might have had designs on 350. Sri Lanka's seam attack had again been exposed as inadequate, and it had needed run-outs to account for Virender Sehwag and Ganguly. But Thilan Samaraweera bowled Dinesh Mongia and had Yuvraj Singh leg-before, and the off-spinner, an occasional component of Sri Lanka's one-day side, did not quite strangle the middle order but at least managed to cling on to its neck for a while. It was another capacity crowd for a match not involving England: multiracial, content and royally entertained. As the floodlights blazed down and the clouds gained an orange hue, anyone fortunate enough to be behind glass might almost have imagined it was summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
