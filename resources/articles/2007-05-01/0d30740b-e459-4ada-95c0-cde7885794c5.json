The Rugby Football Union was yesterday drawing up a draft agreement which it hopes to present to Premier Rugby by tomorrow but the two sides would then have to gain the approval of their organisations before anything could be signed. The RFU had provisionally called a meeting of its management board tomorrow but that is likely to be postponed until next week when Premier Rugby's board will also meet. European Rugby Cup Ltd will be asked this weekend to give the sides until the end of the month to find a resolution. Progress has been made on such matters as the RFU paying in full the club contracts of England's top 32 players, game limits and rest periods. And Twickenham has succeeded in getting Premier Rugby to drop its initial demand of \u00a310.6m a year for giving England control of the elite squad to \u00a39m. Nevertheless, obstacles remain. Premier Rugby's three-man negotiating team is divided. The deal is being driven by its chairman, Tom Walkinshaw, but the Leicester chief executive, Peter Wheeler, believes clubs manage players better than England and fears central management will ration the league appearances of the elite squad to no more than eight a season. Walkinshaw wants the agreement to last for eight or 10 years but the RFU negotiators prefer a four-year deal, citing the eight-year long-form agreement signed with the clubs in 2001 which the RFU quickly discovered could not deliver what it had hoped it would and which has been a winner only for lawyers. The future of the Heineken Cup depends on the outcome of the talks because the leading French clubs have said they will only take part in the tournament if the RFU and Premier Rugby reach a long-term agreement, while Premier Rugby still has to confirm its participation next season, and it was Walkinshaw who persuaded ERC to set tomorrow's deadline. Walkinshaw recognises that the RFU's consultative document on the future of elite rugby, the Way Forward, could commit the Union to a course which is anathema to the leading clubs when it is presented to the council on June 22 and turned into policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
