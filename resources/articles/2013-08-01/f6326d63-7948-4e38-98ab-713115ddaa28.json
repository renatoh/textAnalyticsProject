This set led by acclaimed young New Yorker Patrick Cornelius, an alto saxophonist with a coolly rounded sound and fleetfooted delivery, has some such moments; but if the elegantly polyphonic themes don't always grab the attention, Cornelius's improvising certainly does, alongside that of pianist Frank Kimbrough and trumpeter Michael Rodriguez, with Whirlwind boss Michael Janisch's inimitable double-bass growl lurking beneath. Three successive mid-album episodes here \u2013 Janisch's dark, Charlie Hadenesque intro to the ballad Waiting, the same track's brass/reeds melody, and the headlong, bopping twister that follows it, Puzzler \u2013 sound like they should have been the first dozen minutes of the set, but Cornelius is also breathily affecting on the dreamy In the Quiet Moments, with Kimbrough sympathetically mirroring his patient eloquence. Cornelius is due in the UK on 12 October as part of Whirlwind's festival at Kings Place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
