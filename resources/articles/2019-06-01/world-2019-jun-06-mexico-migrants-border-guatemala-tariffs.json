Trump last week pledged to impose 5% tariffs on Mexican products on 10 June unless Mexico stops Central American migrants from travelling through its territory. US and Mexican officials met for a second day on Thursday to avert the tariffs, but have not reached an agreement. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, said in Pennsylvania on Thursday that the US was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Mexico\u2019s latest proposals but that, so far, tariffs still were set to take effect on Monday. He added that it would be \u201cfor the president to decide\u201d whether Mexico was doing enough to head off the tariffs. Pence said that, among other issues, negotiators had been discussing a potential agreement to make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the US. Mexico has long resisted that request. The Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, took office six months ago promising to protect migrants\u2019 rights and avoid doing the \u201cdirty work\u201d of any foreign government. But as US officials reiterated Trump\u2019s threats this week, their counterparts south of the border have made a show of taking steps to stem the flow of migrants streaming out of Central America. Mexican immigration officials and navy marines corralled a caravan of Central American migrants on Wednesday, less than a day after it crossed into the country and marched up the highway under the scorching hot sun. The column of men women and children had barely walked 12km on Mexican soil before it was stopped; previous caravans have successfully travelled nearly 4,000km across the length of the country to the US border. \u201cWe have the full right to do it, we\u2019re a sovereign country, we have migratory laws, which we have to apply and have to be respected,\u201d said the interior minister, Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero. On the same day, police arrested two members of the migrants\u2019 rights organisation Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), which coordinates caravans crossing Mexico. Pueblos Sin Frontera said the detentions followed a pattern of harassment from the authorities in both countries against individuals assisting migrants and an attempt at \u201ccriminalising\u201d the caravans. On Thursday the finance ministry\u2019s financial intelligence unit announced it had blocked the accounts of 26 people for \u201ctheir probable link with human trafficking and illicit support of migrant caravans\u201d. Recent weeks have already seen a proliferation of immigration checkpoints in southern Mexico and police raids on migrant centers. A string of caravans \u2013 some of them as many as 5,000 people \u2013 have set out from Central America over the past year. Caravan members have told reporters that large numbers offer safety from bandits and corrupt police officers and that the groups coalesced organically, often after they were promoted on social media. But the Mexican government fears Trump\u2019s tariffs will damage the manufacturing-for-export economy. Figures released this week showed arrests at the US-Mexico border reached their highest level in a decade. Observers say Mexico prefers not to mix issues such as trade and immigration in its dealings with the US, but the Trump administration is attempting to push ever increasing responsibility for stopping migrants to its southern neighbour. \u201cThey want Mexico to stop migrants by all means possible,\u201d said Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the Strauss Center at the University of Texas. \u201cThey want to outsource both enforcement and asylum processing, it seems.\u201d In the negotiations on Thursday in Washington, Mexico reportedly offered to send 6,000 members of its newly formed national guard \u2013 a militarised police with immigration enforcement powers \u2013 to its southern border. US negotiators also proposed returning detained Guatemalans to Mexico and sending asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras back to Guatemala, according to the Washington Post. Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Roberto Velasco \u00c1lvarez, tweeted on Thursday that no agreement had been reached, but added: \u201cThe US position is focused on migratory control measures. Ours is on development.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has promoted development in Central America as the solution to slowing migration, though analysts say such plans would take decades to unfold. Meanwhile, the factors driving migrants from Central America \u2013 hunger, climate change, unemployment, crime and violence \u2013 remain in place. \u201cPeople don\u2019t stop leaving their countries of origins,\u201d said Salva Lacruz, coordinator with the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova Human Rights Centre in Tapachula.
