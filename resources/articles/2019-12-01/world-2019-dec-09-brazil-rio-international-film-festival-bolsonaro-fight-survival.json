A public plea for support and months of desperate campaigning followed \u2013 including a crowdfunding drive that helped earn the festival a stay of execution. After a one-month delay, Brazil\u2019s premiere film expo will open on Monday \u2013 albeit with a slimmed-down program of just 190 films, compared with up to 400 before. But the festival\u2019s fight for survival is symptomatic of a wider crisis engulfing Brazilian cinema under an ultra-conservative president who has identified the arts as a key source of opposition to his administration and declared the state has \u201cbigger priorities\u201d than culture. \u201cThe consensus is that the destruction of the Brazilian film industry is in full joyful swing by this far-right government,\u201d Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, one of Brazil\u2019s most celebrated directors, wrote on Facebook last week. \u201cWhat the government is doing is strangling Brazilian cinema,\u201d said Eduardo Valente, a film director and critic. \u201cThey are making it harder and harder for this sector to exist.\u201d Brazilian cinema \u2013 put on the map by global hits such as City of God and Aquarius \u2013 has suffered a succession of blows since Bolsonaro took office in January, from a general lack of interest in the arts to more pointed attacks on films dealing with themes such as sexual diversity and race. In September, Brazil\u2019s national cinema agency, Ancine, withdrew financial support helping film-makers promote their work at overseas festivals, affecting several works with racial and LGBTQ+ themes. Diego Paulino was among those whose funding vanished. A week before the 28-year-old was due to fly to Lisbon to promote his short film Negrum3 at an LGBTQ+ festival, Ancine withdrew the 4,600 reais (\u00a3883) grant slated to fund his trip. \u201cI was left with nothing,\u201d said Paulino, whose film deals with \u201cblackness and queerness\u201d and was produced last year with public funding. With the help of a crowdfunding campaign Paulino made it to the festival \u2013 but, to him, the government\u2019s message was clear. \u201cThey say it\u2019s about the money but we know that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about making a statement.\u201d In its most symbolic and explicit blow to the film sector, the Bolsonaro government in August also suspended a 70m reais (\u00a313.5m) public television grant scheme slated to finance several series focusing on LGBTQ+ issues, sexual diversity and race. The president personally attacked four projects earmarked for funding. \u201cIt\u2019s money thrown away,\u201d Bolsonaro said in a social media broadcast. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in making a movie with this theme.\u201d The assault on cinema exploring issues of diversity has struck a particularly sinister chord in Brazil, where censorship was a key tool of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship for which Bolsonaro often expresses admiration. Maur\u00edcio Mac\u00eado, whose project Sexo Reverso was among those lambasted by the president, believes cinema is being persecuted and has been \u201cchosen as the enemy\u201d by Bolsonaro\u2019s government. \u201cThis was undoubtedly censorship,\u201d said Mac\u00eado, whose project explores the curiosity of the Metis indigenous people in the sexual preferences of a white anthropologist studying the tribe. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t interested in discussing themes that try to give visibility to indigenous people, to LGBT people.\u201d Ancine, which many see as a crucial support structure for Brazil\u2019s nascent independent cinema, has also been dramatically weakened under Bolsonaro. The institution saw its budget slashed by nearly half and its financing activities have largely ground to a halt. Three of the four seats in the agency\u2019s directorial board are currently vacant, making it impossible for funding to be distributed or decisions made about future projects, said Valente, who worked there until 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s the most cruel and, in a way, invisible hand that is being played right now. The government is killing this industry through inaction,\u201d said Valente. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty convinced it\u2019s a conscious decision and not something that\u2019s just happening by chance.\u201d In an industry where long-term planning is central, the uncertainty has been crippling. Valente said the result would probably be a decline in the number of Brazilian films being produced. Ancine\u2019s gradual dismantling also poses a particular threat to independent film-makers and small production companies, said one film director who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is going to destroy the independent film industry that was built with funding from Ancine,\u201d he said. \u201cA newcomer, someone with no experience, coming out of college \u2013 they\u2019re not going to be able to make movies anymore.\u201d Bruno Victor and Marcus Azevedo, whose project Afronte was also hit by the cancellation of the Ancine television grant, have found this out the hard way. The film-makers have yet to secure financing to produce their series. \u201cWe need public support to produce our projects because here in Brazil, it\u2019s the only option we have,\u201d said Victor, 28, whose film tells the story of a gay black man in suburban Bras\u00edlia. For many Brazilian film-makers, the future remains uncertain. Some are turning to streaming services such as Netflix for help producing work tackling LGBTQ+ issues or diversity themes. Others are leaning on more supportive municipal or state governments that still champion cinema. Others, however, are training their cameras on topics less likely to offend the government. \u201cI think we\u2019re all scared,\u201d the director said. \u201cSo we are self-censoring in the things we want to talk about \u2013 and that\u2019s the most dangerous part.\u201d This article was amended on 9 December 2019 to clarify that Ancine withdrew Diego Paulino\u2019s grant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
