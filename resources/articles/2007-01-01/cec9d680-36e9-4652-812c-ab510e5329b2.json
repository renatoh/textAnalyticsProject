Sir Alistair Graham's comments came during a press conference to launch a highly critical report on the performance of the Electoral Commission which polices party funding and oversees electoral law. The report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life describes the commission as having \"a lack of courage, competence and leadership\" in its role as regulator of funding and said that it should have issued guidance on the loans as soon as it became aware of them in April 2005. It also said the commission had failed in warning of the dangers of electoral fraud resulting from the extension of postal voting. Sir Alistair, who disclosed he had passed the findings to the Scotland Yard deputy assistant commissioner, John Yates, who is investigating the \"cash for honours\" scandal, expressed doubt whether the loans were given at commercial rates. He said he had \"no doubt\" that many would be converted into donations or extended, rolling loans. He said: \"Let's be in the real world about this. I have no doubt, when these loans were being made, people thought 'hopefully we will be able to lengthen the length of time over which the loan is repaid or we may be able to translate it into a donation'. I'm not letting the political parties off the hook in any respect in terms of their behaviour.\" Sir Alistair insisted that he was \"not saying they broke the law\", but added: \"There were clear moral pressures on the political parties as far as their behaviour [is concerned].\" His report calls for a radical overhaul of the Electoral Commission. It said the commission should be stripped of responsibility for constituency boundaries, electoral policy and encouraging people to vote so it could focus on its core functions. A new compliance unit should take investigative action on party funding and campaign expenditure, and financial penalties should be introduced for breaches The committee also called for the introduction of individual voter registration to replace the \"19th-century\" system under which the \"head of the household\" fills in the names of those eligible to vote. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger denied the commission had lacked courage and leadership. He said: \"Before the Electoral Commission existed, little was known about where the political parties got their money, or how they spent it. Today the opposite is true. And where there has been evidence that the parties have not followed the rules, we have acted.\" Labour party chairwoman Hazel Blears said: \"We welcome the committee's view that the Electoral Commission must move to focus much more clearly on its core activities as a regulator of both parties and of electoral services.\" Shadow constitutional affairs spokesman Oliver Heald also welcomed the report. He said: \"There is now overwhelming pressure on the government to bring in tougher laws against growing electoral fraud, such as introducing ... individual electoral registration.\" Sir Alistair's remarks came as it became clear that efforts to secure a cross party deal on the future of political funding were foundering. The Conservatives have rejected Labour proposals for a voluntary cap on donations, enforced with civil penalties by the Electoral Commission. Sir Hayden Phillips, a former senior civil servant, met Tony Blair on Tuesday to discuss Labour proposals, and a meeting of the cabinet yesterday heard that Sir Hayden was sympathetic to the Labour plan. But Sir Hayden, due to release an interim report this month, was forced to issue a statement saying he was not backing any specific proposal and the views of the two parties were divergent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
