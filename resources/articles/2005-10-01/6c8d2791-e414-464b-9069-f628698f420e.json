Parvathalu, a barber, was beaten and locked in his shop by a group of 150 women. They then set fire to the shop in the village of Muddireddypalli, said police. The villagers suspected Parvathalu of practising black magic and held him responsible for the large number of deaths in the village in the past year. The attack was prompted by the death of another woman this week, police said. They planned to arrest all the women involved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
