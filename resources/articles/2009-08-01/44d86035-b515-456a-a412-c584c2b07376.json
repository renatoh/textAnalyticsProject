Sussex University graduates Shanti Andrews and Rebecca Turner, both 23, were found guilty of attempted fraud and the false reporting of a crime after they admitted that they had wrongly told police that thieves had stolen \u00a31,000 worth of property from them. The law graduates were sentenced to one year and four months in jail at a court in central Rio, but the prison time was converted into community service by the judge. Eduardo Tonini, one of the women's lawyers, told the Guardian his clients were \"happy not to have to return to prison\" but said they would appeal the sentence within the next five days. \"The sentence was hard, it was pretty rigorous. We thought that it would be better,\" Tonini said, adding that the women had rented a flat in Rio where they would stay until their appeal hearing, which would probably take place within \"weeks\". Judge Flavio Itabaiana ruled that the pair should perform seven hours of community service each day in Brazil for a period of eight months and ordered them to pay a fine of around \u00a33,000. Tonini said the community service could be \"in a hospital or an NGO or some other institution\" but added that the lawyers would ask for the service to be carried out in England. Andrews and Turner were on the last leg of a nine-month round-the-world trip when they were arrested in Rio in July 26 and accused of falsely reporting a robbery in order to claim on insurance. They admitted the charges in court on Monday, claiming that they had indeed been robbed but had reported more items taken than had actually been stolen. Meanwhile on Tuesday police in Sao Paulo said they had arrested another 23-year-old British tourist, accused of trying to smuggle 700g of cocaine to Europe hidden inside her shoes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
