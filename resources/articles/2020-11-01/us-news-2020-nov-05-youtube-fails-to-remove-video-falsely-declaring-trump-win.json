The Google-owned site has instead disabled adverts on the video, produced by the far-right TV channel One America News Network. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe remove ads from videos that contain content that is demonstrably false about election results, like this video.\u201d The video, which has been viewed almost 400,000 times since it was posted on Wednesday, opens with the channel\u2019s anchor, Christina Bobb, declaring: \u201cPresident Trump won four more years in office last night.\u201d Bobb goes on to say that a number of states where the voting has yet to be completed, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, are \u201call Trump\u2019s \u2026 This is a decisive victory for Trump\u201d. She accuses the \u201cDemocrat leadership\u201d of Pennsylvania and Michigan of stopping the vote counts, because \u201cthey need time to find more ballots\u201d. Bobb then accuses Democrats of \u201ctossing Republican votes\u201d and \u201charvesting fake ballots\u201d. The video goes on to call on conservatives to \u201cfight back against corruption\u201d, by calling up their state representatives and demanding they \u201cfinish the tally and give the American people the result\u201d. YouTube has strong policies against election interference, but almost all of them cease to apply once votes have been cast, the company said. \u201cOur community guidelines prohibit content misleading viewers about voting, for example content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cThe content of this video doesn\u2019t rise to that level.\u201d \u201cAll search results and videos about this election \u2013 including this video \u2013 surface an information panel noting that election results may not be final, and we are continuing to raise up authoritative content in search results and recommendations. We will continue to be vigilant in the post-election period.\u201d While Facebook and Twitter have enacted wide-ranging policies in an attempt to prevent premature claims of victory, Google\u2019s response has been muted. The company pulled all political advertising once polls closed, in an effort to prevent its ad platform from being used to promote such propaganda, but resisted calls to ban it in user-generated content. The company has also faced criticism for providing advertising services to far-right news sites such as Gateway Pundit, which are promoting claims of electoral fraud. \u201cMisinformation sites like Gateway Pundit are now citing fabricated stats of voter turnout to undermine trust in the election results,\u201d said the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group. \u201cUnbelievably, Google is still placing ads on these sites, profiting from these falsehoods.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
