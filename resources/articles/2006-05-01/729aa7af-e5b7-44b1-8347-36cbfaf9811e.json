I became a trustee in 1986 because I wanted to support the Butler Trust, which recognises the incredible work that prison staff do to help reduce reoffending. It was a real privilege to be asked to take up the position of chairman. What qualities and skills are needed? Your role is to try to give everybody the opportunity to contribute as much as they are able. You are the Football Association's director of football development. What qualities does a manager require? The main requirement in any management role is to make sure everyone feels they are given the opportunity to contribute significantly in their areas of expertise. Whoever is at the top or bottom, everybody has a role to play in the structure of any organisation. What leadership skills did you take with you from your experiences in football? The importance of preparation and making sure you are focused on the right priorities and channelling the different strengths of each individual in the right direction. Every individual has a particular strength. They also have weaknesses. The skill is to put these into a structure that makes as much impact as possible. How can sport help young offenders to stop committing crimes? It is important to alleviate boredom while in custody. Awareness of healthy eating and the benefits of regular exercise are helpful in rehabilitation. Tackling drugs through sport has proved effective in a number of prisons and young offender institutions. Numeracy and literacy skills are improved dramatically by using players' records and statistics to capture the interest of offenders: goals scored, for instance. What's the best piece of management advice you have been given? The minute you stop believing you've still got something to learn, you are in trouble. What did you learn on your recent visit to Deerbolt young offender institution? Its pilot High Intensity Training programme offers young offenders a range of opportunities, from achieving NVQs in plastering, forklift truck driving and recycling to the Mobile Team Challenge, which focuses on anti-bullying, team building and social and life skills. As many offenders have not been used to aiming for something, the opportunity to succeed in gaining a recognised qualification is a really positive step forward. Do you have a management guru? Two West Ham coaches, Ron Greenwood and John Lyall, who both sadly died earlier this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
