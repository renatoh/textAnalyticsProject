The prime minister led a session on the environment at the G20 summit in Osaka, which will be one of her final appearances on the world stage. In the G20 communique, which was agreed after many hours of wrangling among the \u201csherpas\u201d, who represent the group\u2019s member states, 19 of the 20 reiterated their commitment to the Paris accord. The final wording echoed a statement from the last G20 summit, in Buenos Aires, but government sources suggested some countries, including the US, India and China, had tried to water it down. The US president had sought to excise the reference to the Paris agreement from the communique altogether, with the help of several other countries, reportedly including Brazil and Turkey. May said she was pleased there was a communique at all. At her press conference at the end of the summit, the prime minister said: \u201cIn recent months we have heard hundreds of thousands of young people urge us \u2013 their leaders \u2013 to act on climate change before it\u2019s too late. \u201cI am proud that the UK has now enshrined in law our world-leading net zero commitment to reduce emissions. And I have called on other countries to raise their ambition and embrace this target,\u201d she said. The prime minister said the communique showed the 19 members\u2019 continued support for the Paris agreement and she stressed the importance of cooperation with other countries. \u201cI firmly believe in the importance of international cooperation and compromise. In Osaka this week we have worked hard to bridge differences between G20 countries on some of the biggest challenges our nations face. \u201cThat has not been easy but we have made progress. I continue to believe that we are stronger when we work together.\u201d May did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Trump at the summit, but said she had held discussions with him, and pointed out that he had visited the UK earlier this month. Earlier, a senior UK official said of the communique: \u201cI think it was a long night for the sherpas and I think it\u2019s definitely a challenging process but work is ongoing in relation to the communique so we\u2019ll have to see where we end up.\u201d He said the UK had pushed for \u201cthe strongest wording we can deliver\u201d. May has embraced the cause of tackling climate change as her three-year premiership draws to a close \u2013 telling journalists en route to Japan that she had been inspired on her walking holidays in Switzerland by seeing the rapid rate at which a glacier had receded over the past decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
