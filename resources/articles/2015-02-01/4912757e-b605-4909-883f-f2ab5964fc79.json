Speaking with the military newspaper Stars and Stripes last Wednesday, Williams said he \u201cassumed\u201d a helicopter he was traveling in had been hit by ground fire because the helicopter made an unscheduled landing and ended up alongside another helicopter that had been hit. It was the first time he had publicly discussed such an assumption. On Monday, Stars and Stripes offered a fuller version of Williams\u2019 account when it published the entire transcript of the interview with Williams in which the paper first confronted him about the incident. Stars and Stripes pursued the story after soldiers who were in Iraq challenged Williams on Facebook about his version of events. \u201cBecause I knew we had all come under fire, I guess I had assumed that all of the airframes took some damage because we all went down,\u201d Williams told the newspaper last Wednesday, using jargon for the body and wings of an aircraft. Later that day, Williams would issue his only other public statement on the matter, in an apology on his newscast. \u201cI made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago,\u201d Williams said on the air. \u201cI want to apologize. I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by an RPG fire. I was instead in a following aircraft.\u201d NBC News has since declined to comment on the controversy, apart from announcing an internal investigation. Williams announced on Saturday that, in his role as managing editor of NBC Nightly News, he was temporarily taking himself out of the anchor\u2019s chair. An appearance by Williams on the Late Show with David Letterman planned for Thursday was subsequently cancelled. In his interview last week with Stars and Stripes, Williams blamed his mixed stories on fear he had felt at the time, saying the experience \u201call became a fog\u201d as his helicopter sought to land. In his original 26 March 2003 broadcast about the incident, Williams says a radio dispatch from the helicopter that was hit made it \u201cclear this routine mission is running into trouble\u201d. \u201cAll we knew is we had been fired upon,\u201d Williams told Stars and Stripes. \u201cAll we knew was we had set down and then with the arrival of the sandstorm, how do we defend our little desert bivouac area.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very basic I would not have chosen to make this mistake. I don\u2019t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft from the other.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
