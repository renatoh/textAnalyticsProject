Steering clear of major labels, they sell out 2,000-seat venues and release successful download-only singles; this month they won the NME's John Peel prize for innovation on the strength of their head-bending mix of hardcore metal and trance. But it's hard to see all of that translating into album sales. Take to the Skies is a demanding listen, its hard-as-nails metal kicking seven bells out of the trancey synthesiser. Singer Rou Reynolds has a demonic howl he can be proud of; shame it's not applied a bit less generously. When it works, though, it's quite something. The prog ballad Today Won't Go Down in History and the Faithless-meets-Napalm-Death wig-out of Mothership show that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing noisily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
