Two questions suggest themselves. Simplification of what, exactly? Of tax liabilities? Of the moral choices of footballers? Or possibly of his prime minister's private life, which could certainly do with it? And then, should the UK too have such a department? Our answer to that is a firm \"perhaps\". No nation should be too proud to learn from others in these matters. Italy also has a minister of platform accomplishment, and Mali one for handicrafts. France may have long ago closed its ministre des cultes (minister for worship) and disposed of its Protestant affairs secretary, but Denmark retains a minister for ecclesiastical affairs, while Bolivia has a minister for foreign affairs and worship. Might we gain from emulating New Zealand by installing a minister for correction? Or Chad, with one minister for ethics and another for sanitation and good governance? Yet the oddest contender in the catalogue of officialdom is one containing a captain of the yeomen of the guard and a captain of gentlemen at arms. Though the offices of master of the buckhounds and mistress of the robes were disposed of around the time Victoria died, the UK persists in calling the two chief whips in the Lords by these inexplicable names. We should celebrate them or, failing that, set a UK department of simplification to work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
