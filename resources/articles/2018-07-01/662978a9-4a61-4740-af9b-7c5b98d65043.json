Over the course of one night in one room, Jo (Tuppence Middleton) and Harry (John Hopkins), chuck jokes, insults and each other around. Their arguments are more exciting than their sex life, with Jo munching and throwing Wotsits as they watch porn together. Waiting for a text to announce that Jo\u2019s sister has given birth, their evening is repeatedly interrupted by Kerry (Julia Sandiford), Harry\u2019s former lover, who still has her eye fixed on him. Savage comments ricochet into the early hours of the morning and centre stage are the gaps between laughter and fear, wit and cruelty, sex and rape \u2013 mere inches apart on the red leather sofa. At first, Harry and Jo get off by challenging each other, and Kerry\u2019s purpose is to re-equip the couple when they run out of ammo. But Harry\u2019s aggression spills into his actions. He hurts Jo, hits her. A hand in her pants moves to her neck and doesn\u2019t let go. Some she asks for, some she doesn\u2019t. His control over her body feels like vengeance. But despite what most would see as domestic violence \u2013 if not sexual assault then \u201csexual something\u201d as Kerry says \u2013 they settle disturbingly quickly back into intimacy and laughter. The corny soundtrack of Phantom of the Opera plays over scene changes where nothing but the clock moves. The beautiful but unnecessary luminous moon and laser-cut sitting room simply distract from the piercing dialogue and Steve Marmion\u2019s neat direction. The One asks some valuable questions \u2013 where the boundary of assault lies and how far regret absolves you \u2013 but by focusing largely on the sadistic games of a bored middle-class couple, it limits the conversation around domestic violence. Wanting violent sex, rape fantasies and being raped are incredibly different things. An hour isn\u2019t long enough to unpick all these issues, and instead the play throws them up in the air like the Wotsits that are caught on a tongue or peeled off a sticky leg for later. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until 25 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
