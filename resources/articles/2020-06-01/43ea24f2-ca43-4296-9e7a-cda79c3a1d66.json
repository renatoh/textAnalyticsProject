The former Davis Cup player said the All England Club\u2019s finance department is going through its claim with more than 10 insurance companies. \u201cI have seen speculative figures and I don\u2019t recognise any of them,\u201d he said, referring to one estimate of a claim for \u00a3114m when the club cancelled in April, for the first time since the second world war. \u201cIt is too soon \u2013 even if there wasn\u2019t commercial confidentiality \u2013 to give you a figure. It\u2019s looked at line by line: every cost, expenditure, bit of income, revenue, whether it has to be repaid, all that sort of thing. It is a very time-consuming and laborious process. We have a good relationship with the brokers. It\u2019s going well, but the final outcome won\u2019t be known for several months.\u201d Lewis, who hands over to Sally Bolton next month after eight years guiding Wimbledon\u2019s ambitious expansion plans, said the annual \u00a340m handout to the Lawn Tennis Association has been largely safeguarded. \u201cIt won\u2019t be severely impacted. If you have to cancel, it\u2019s great to have insurance. We\u2019re still in a very good position, which is a slightly strange thing to say when you\u2019ve just cancelled the championships. \u201cBut we\u2019re financially very stable. In terms of the impact on ourselves as an organisation and business, and the LTA and therefore British tennis, it\u2019s going to be pretty well protected.\u201d None of the other tournaments took the precaution of insuring against a global virus such as Covid-19, but Lewis says it will not be possible to renew the policy next year. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible in the current climate. When I started in 2012, there were some signs that things were not insurable, because of communicable diseases that had taken place, like Sars and swine flu. In the immediate aftermath, you can\u2019t get insurance but, fairly soon after that, you can, the market returns. So there won\u2019t be insurance next year, but in the medium-term, just because we\u2019ve made one claim, it won\u2019t affect us in the long-term.\u201d Bolton, who has worked at the club since 2016 and in rugby league for many years before that, is the first woman to be chief executive in the club\u2019s long history \u2013 coincidentally taking over at the same time as Stacey Allaster at the US Tennis Association and, closer to home, Clare Connor as president of the MCC. She said it was too early to say how the club would present next year\u2019s tournament if the virus was still having a global impact, adding: \u201cIt is our absolute wish that next year\u2019s championship looks like a championship we would all recognise.\u201d That will mean full crowds, if possible. When the club cancelled in April, holding the tournament behind closed doors was not an option, and that remains the case, it appears. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the US Open and Roland Garros being staged later this year and we will be looking closely at what they do, working with the constraints they find themselves under and learning what we can.\u201d Bolton has not spoken to Allaster. \u201cI think she is pretty focused on getting the US Open on at the moment. I plan to catch up with her maybe later in the year.\u201d They will have much to talk about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
