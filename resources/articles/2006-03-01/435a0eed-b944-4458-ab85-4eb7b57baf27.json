The trio's body language suggested the Aston Villa chairman and his operations director needed placating. \"The chairman knows what I've been saying for a long time, what the reality is, and he understands,\" insisted the manager. \"He's taken that on board.\" If that was unconvincing it was only because a sense of crisis pursues this team. A third defeat in a week has left Villa in infuriating limbo, too adrift of upper mid-table to pursue a European place, marginally too far from the scrap at the foot to contemplate relegation. Instead, they are engulfed in mediocrity. Ellis had scowled his way through the latter stages of this latest embarrassment, mustering only a shake of the head as Villa sank without trace to a chorus of \"We want O'Leary out\" from disgruntled travelling fans. Approached in the aftermath, he declined to articulate his thoughts. \"I'm a little old-fashioned,\" the 82-year-old chairman muttered. \"I've had 37 years of these questions and I won't be giving an answer.\" Ellis was referring to the manager's future. But such is the state of flux at Villa, where takeover talks are supposedly continuing, he may as well have been contemplating his own. Something surely has to give. The club has gone through 13 managers in Ellis's two stints as chairman though, with the fans' faith eroded, the incumbent could be on the brink. O'Leary, contracted until 2008, bemoaned the lack of finances that has prevented him adding to his squad and he was denied a clutch of his better players here through injury. Yet O'Leary's inability to conjure a coherent display from those experienced internationals who remained was damning. Villa's youngsters were sprightly enough - Steve Davis was as industrious as ever and the 19-year-old forward Gabriel Agbonlahor rewarded with a consolation goal on his debut - but the more seasoned players were anonymous. \"The nucleus is there that will be good for Villa's future, but we need to bring good professionals who the kids can learn from,\" said O'Leary. \"We can't do that until things change behind the scenes. I'm not spitting my dummy out, but it's not easy. We have reduced the wage bill, but there's still great expectation at this club. You're constantly reminded about the European Cup, but this is 2006. We were fifth shortly after I came here and all I was told was: 'This is Villa. We should be in the top four.' O'Leary was appointed almost three years ago.\"I know what this club could be like, but things have to change,\" said the manager. \"I had certain things to do when I came here. The club wanted the young players to develop, and they wanted to be the best in the Midlands again.\" Technically, he has achieved both demands though few would be satisfied by 14th place and the prospect of upheaval in the summer, whether in the dug-out or boardroom, lingers. O'Leary's side were outclassed by David Moyes's rampant Everton with the hosts never required to recreate the verve they enjoyed in dismissing Fulham a week earlier. James McFadden's belted volley set the tone and, once he and Tim Cahill had cleared efforts from Agbonlahor and Davis off the line, the Australian rammed in a second from close range. The outstanding Mikel Arteta, outpacing Jlloyd Samuel, supplied Leon Osman for a simple third with their fourth, again dispatched by Cahill, reserved for the dying seconds. Agbonlahor's shot left Richard Wright red-faced, but an eighth win in 12 games since Villa thumped them 4-0 on Boxing Day has maintained Everton's unlikely push for Europe. They certainly boast the personnel to flourish. Arteta has been an inspiration while James Beattie set up the first two goals on Saturday and was tremendous throughout. Add to that McFadden's revival and there is real promise. \"James is Scotland's Wayne Rooney,\" said Moyes. \"He's probably had a better run at international level than with his club, but we're seeing the best of him now.\" The Premiership is belatedly seeing the best of Everton. Man of the match - Mikel Arteta - The Spaniard was wonderfully creative and it was no surprise the hosts hit a lull once he had been withdrawn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
