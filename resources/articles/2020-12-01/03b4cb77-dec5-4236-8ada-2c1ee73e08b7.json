Arsenal have long been dependent on Aubameyang\u2019s finishing but his last Premier League goal from open play came at Fulham on the season\u2019s opening day. Arteta\u2019s attempt to play him back into form by shifting him to centre-forward is yet to pay off; the manager said he is not automatically guaranteed a place but urged for perspective given his club captain\u2019s longer-term record. \u201cNo one is undroppable,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day we have to find the right players to win football matches. But we cannot forget what Auba has done for this club and what he has done in recent months, not years ago. As well, I see how he\u2019s training and how he\u2019s behaving, how much he wants to turn this situation around. When I see that type of hunger, it\u2019s about supporting the player as well as the status he has in the team, because of the performances he has provided.\u201d Arteta said he had not been tempted to give Aubameyang a potentially morale-boosting runout in Thursday\u2019s Europa League tie at Dundalk, which is essentially a practice game given Arsenal have won Group B while the League of Ireland side will finish bottom. The lineup will be similar to the blend of youth and fringe players that beat Rapid Vienna last week, with Thomas Partey among those left behind after aggravating a thigh injury in Sunday\u2019s defeat to Spurs. Partey pulled up in the buildup to Tottenham\u2019s second goal; Arteta said he will miss the next few matches and defended the decision to bring him back for the derby after missing three games. \u201cWe tested [his thigh] three times and he had zero symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cAfterwards people will say it was a bit early but I don\u2019t think it was because he was completely fine to play.\u201d The pressure of reversing Arsenal\u2019s fortunes causes Arteta to \u201csleep less\u201d, he said. He also revealed Arsenal have contacted the authorities after Hector Beller\u00edn was penalised for a fifth foul throw of the season at Spurs. \u201cWe sent the images to the Premier League because there have been many, many incidents, much worse than that but they were never [given],\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
