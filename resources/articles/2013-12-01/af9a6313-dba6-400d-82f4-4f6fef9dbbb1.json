Representatives of the Italian club contacted Liverpool on Monday regarding a temporary deal for the 29-year-old when the transfer window reopens. The Denmark international, who was brought to Anfield from Brondby by Ben\u00edtez in 2006, recently lost his place at the heart of Liverpool's defence and Napoli have moved quickly to test Brendan Rodgers' resolve to keep the centre-half. Rodgers made Agger vice-captain in the summer after Barcelona's interest in signing the defender on a permanent basis but he has been the one to miss out as the Liverpool manager continues his search for a settled partnership in central defence. Kolo Tour\u00e9 was selected in preference to Agger for the Premier League defeat at Hull, only for the Dane to make an immediate return for the 5-1 win over Norwich. Illness then cost Agger his place against West Ham, giving the \u00a318m summer signing Mamadou Sakho the opportunity to stake his claim. The French international retained his place for Sunday's 5-0 rout of Tottenham. Whether Liverpool will be receptive to a loan deal for Agger is uncertain. The influential defender has attracted interest from the Spanish champions and Manchester City in recent seasons and a permanent offer could yet be forthcoming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
