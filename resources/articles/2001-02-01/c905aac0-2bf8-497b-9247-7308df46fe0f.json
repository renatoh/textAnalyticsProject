Not registering for the roll \u0096 which is administered by local authorities \u0096 is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of \u00a31,000. \u0095 Under the new Representation of the People Act 2000 several new groups of people will be permitted to vote for the first time: a) a homeless person who has made a \"declaration of local connection\". This is most likely to be a local day centre, but two enterprising street sleepers have registered themselves at their local park bench. b) People in mental hospitals (other than those with criminal convictions). c) Unconvicted or remand prisoners. They will be able to register in the establishment where they are held if they are likely to be spending a long period remanded in custody. d) People who live on barges (if they list a pub or lock-keeper's house as their roll address). Who cannot vote? \u0095 Sitting peers in the House of Lords. \u0095 Convicted prisoners (this may be liable to challenge under the recently incorporated Human Rights Act). \u0095 Patients in mental hospitals with criminal convictions (this may be liable to challenge under the recently incorporated Human Rights Act)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
