If the absence of spectators for the first three rounds of the PGA Tour\u2019s much-heralded return has been nothing more than a point of reference, how a tightly packed field will respond to a lack of electricity as they pursue glory over the final 18 holes of the Charles Schwab Challenge is a genuine source of intrigue. It may be that Jordan Spieth, in seeking to scale the mountain once more, will benefit the most from the absence of thousands of expectant fans in his native Texas. Spieth doesn\u2019t exactly need added attention. It seems remarkable that Spieth has not won since the Open of 2017, with his subsequent on-course struggles widely recognised. As a Dallas native, Spieth knows Fort Worth\u2019s Colonial Country Club better than anyone else in the field. He begins day four just one from the 13-under-par lead held by Xander Schauffele. Should Spieth prevail, the upshot is sure to be emotional. His attempts to do precisely that are guaranteed to prove fascinating. \u201cI think as the week has gone on it\u2019s felt weirder, in my opinion,\u201d Spieth said of the unorthodox backdrop. \u201cGoing in, I thought that Monday to Friday would be somewhat normal and then Saturday and Sunday would be a bit odd. Today definitely felt a lot different for it being a Saturday afternoon in the last group, when you kind of think about the situation you\u2019re in, you just don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re actually out there doing that. I just felt like I was playing a normal round.\u201d Spieth again looked far from his best during a third round of 68, with his putting something of a saving grace. He has Collin Morikawa, Branden Grace, Gary Woodland and Justin Thomas for company on 12 under par. Schauffele made birdie on the last for a 66 to ensure he carries the slimmest of leads into the final day. \u201cToday was a day where I look at the last couple years and potentially say that would have been a two or three over and taken me all the way out of the tournament,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI like the progression I\u2019ve been able to make. I feel comfortable going into tomorrow that I can shoot a good score.\u201d Rory McIlroy also hopes his bad day is now removed from the equation. The world No 1, who signed for a wonderful 63 on Friday, was unspectacular during a subsequent 69. McIlroy is three shots off the lead. Justin Rose and Patrick Reed \u2013 who produced a 63 of his own on Saturday \u2013 have matched McIlroy\u2019s 54-hole aggregate. That this promises to be quite the charge towards the finishing line is emphasised by the fact 14 players, including six major champions, are within three of the unflappable Schauffele. \u201cFor a Saturday afternoon being in contention on the PGA Tour, it felt sort of weird out there,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThe first couple of days it was fine, but definitely today it\u2019s feeling strange. I\u2019m sure tomorrow will feel pretty strange, especially with so many guys in and around the lead.\u201d McIlroy knows what he has to improve on. \u201cI\u2019ve been leaving a lot of putts short,\u201d the Northern Irishman said. \u201cYou\u2019d think after three days you should adjust but it\u2019s still tough to get yourself to hit them.\u201d Ian Poulter moved to seven under courtesy of a 67. Brooks Koepka is two shots further back after adding a 69 to back-to-back 68s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
