I mean what is the point?\" I can hear Basil Fawlty right now, with Alan Hansen, Alan Green and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger alongside, walking the walk. What is the point of the superpowers of European football wasting their time playing mountains, tax havens and shipping areas? \"Rockall,\" they chorus. But what do these minnows themselves think? My first port of call was that noble islet's near neighbour, the Faroes. One of those \"piddling little nations\" as a BBC colleague sensitively termed them. I rang the Faroes Football Association. \"Hello I'm from the Guardian newspaper.\" \"Ah my Guardian angel,\" he replied. \"Is that the press officer?\" \"Speaking.\" \"Could you put me through to the general secretary please?\" \"Speaking.\" Isak Mikladel is both. I presumed the president was otherwise disposed making a minke whale stir fry. I told Isak what people were saying. He chuckled heartily. \"It says more about them than it does about us.\" The po-faced Wenger sprang to mind. \"When you live in a small country, some years it is not so lucky and some years it is better. At this moment it is not so lucky but I'm sure in the future we will play up against many of these teams when they come to the Faroes and when they are beaten they will not be very happy about it.\" He is right. The beautiful thing about football is that over 90 minutes, on one day in your life, miracles can happen. That's why we love it. Then Mikladel got sentimental, as he remembered his country's greatest ever result. They had no ground back then so the tie was played in Sweden. Ah yes, that unforgettable night (a midday kick-off) when the Faroes beat Austria 1-0 in the qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships. Liesel, Freidrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl - your boys took a hell of a beating. He is right, too, when he says that international football should be a family. Call me old-fashioned but shouldn't families eat from the same table? To devalue that sense of belonging is to capitulate to the overarching power lust of the big clubs, which is in serious danger of oozing from football's every pore. Wenger is in serious danger of knowing the price of everything and value of zilch. \"In each Euro qualifying group, there are seven or eight teams resulting from the break-up of the Soviet Union and former eastern bloc countries and also from the integration of small states such as Andorra and Liechtenstein,\" Wenger said. Smarting at being so dreadfully inconvenienced by the end of the cold war and triumph of the free world, he went on: \"Arsenal, Real Madrid or AC Milan are not going to accept for ever paying players a fortune without being able to use them on account of national teams.\" It is not as if Wenger is completely against international football. He can't be. He had a lucrative gig as a pundit for Japanese TV during the World Cup but maybe there is a clue in the number of caps he won. I got another laugh when I quoted his comments to Andrea Schneider, the spokeswoman for the Liechtenstein FA who has previously worked for Uefa. Beyond the guffaw, she was diplomacy itself: \"If we are having a good day we can make their lives a little bit harder. Every now and then you see interesting results.\" Liechtenstein amassed eight points in World Cup qualification and in one of their draws scored two more goals against Portugal than England managed in Gelsenkirchen. And solely on the grounds that if you make a difference you are worth your place, then battered and beleaguered San Marino have paid their dues many times over with the fastest goal in World Cup history when England beat them 7-1 but failed to amass a goal difference sufficient to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. Alan Green is usually spot on, as well he knows, but the other day he told me: \"The Faroes, Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein and San Marino should be made to pre-qualify. There is an over-crowded international calendar and it gets up the noses of the clubs.\" Yipee, say I. Hansen despairs of Andorra. \"What is the purpose of playing a team who were 100-1 to win a game of 11 against 11?\" and Wenger declares: \"Having so many games flatters the national pride of countries, who all have a vote with Fifa.\" He just doesn't see it. No change there then. I'd love to fly Ars\u00e8ne to the Faroes, get him to stand atop the highest peak, Slaettaratindur (2,894ft), breathe the air, smell the sea and in a different sense look down on that proud nation. Isak could be his guardian angel. \"It's not north London but it's home.\" Why Woodward still needs to watch his back among the BOA's blazers I've seen many a press release in my time, having been a cipher (radio presenter) of unmitigated bollocks for some years now and they are habitually master-classes in spin, obfuscation or both. At the very least you have to crowbar the truth from between the lines. Not so with UK Sport's response to Sir Clive Woodward's appointment as the British Olympic Association's director of elite performance, though. The first part is cooing - \"Clive's extensive knowledge and experience of elite sport will be a great asset\" - but it is as if they saved writing the last line until they had all rolled back into the office at 4.30 after lunch at the boozer. \"What we all need to avoid is any confusion over responsibilities and we look forward to working with Clive to ensure this does not occur.\" So butt out Woody. There may be trouble ahead. Woodward's appointment is clearly intended to give some credibility to the BOA and cast it as an outfit for the future and not just a bunch of blazers genuflecting in the magisterial presence of that woman of the people, the Princess extremely Royal. One leading figure who you would have thought was well above the fray said recently: \"The BOA are just a bunch of travel agents who turn up every four years, fly in and take all the credit.\" Clive is a key part of the BOA's Lord Moynihan-led makeover but this is politics and politics is brutal. UK Sport are watching nervously. Harry Redknapp is watching knowingly and yet again, Clive is watching his back. If Cole must sell his dignity, he's set too low a price \"Some of you think I'm a greedy pig, and its nothing like that. It's never been about money,\" said Ashley Cole at the Chelsea press conference last week before availing us of the fact that we could read the full story in his book. What is it with footballers and books? Some are terrific, some are turgid but what is the imperative? The desire to routinely communicate innermost thoughts and feelings to the world is not immediately associated with the kicker of a ball and if setting the record straight on a particular episode is the issue, why not give one well-placed interview to a well-disposed journo. I'm led to the disturbing conclusion that money might well have something to do with it. Gazza and Bestie were strapped for cash so fair play. Rooney got a reported \u00a35m deal for a set of autobiographies but again, who couldn't use five million quid. But what's it all about Ashley? I am reliably informed he got a \u00a3250,000 advance from the publisher and \u00a3125,000 for serialisation from the Times. He'll have to sell an awful lot of copies to move into big royalties so call it 400k top whack. Blood money - for spilling beans, making enemies, attracting ridicule and bringing even more tabloid attention upon himself. Would you let some hack point his dictaphone at you for four weeks' wages? Would you degrade yourself for that? Me too. Going for a song with Wayne, Mike and Coleen Perhaps I am being naive but I was bemused by the recent claim that Wayne Rooney punched Blackburn's Michael Gray for asking if Coleen would be interested in forming a threesome. I was unaware that any of them had the slightest interest in music let alone sang or played. I can't see him in a Peter, Paul and Mary combo let as alone part of the dungaree three from Rainbow - Rod, Jane and Freddie. And since when did Gray play a holding midfield role?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
