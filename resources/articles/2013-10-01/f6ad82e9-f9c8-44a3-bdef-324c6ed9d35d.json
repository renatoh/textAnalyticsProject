Before I get to that, if you don\u2019t follow them, here\u2019s something about the community: they really are a community. They interact. They know each other. They have built relationships. They travel half way round the world to hang out. I\u2019ve been part of several spheres of blogging over the last decade, but none of them come close to how close these guys are. Not even the knitters. I feel enriched to be a small part of the periphery of this community. The sociologist in me also finds them endlessly fascinating. I don\u2019t want to pretend it\u2019s all some big hippie campfire of love and happiness. There are fractions and fights and differences, like any community. A paper I wrote on science blogging a few years back was titled \u201cScienceBlogs is a high school clique, Nature Network is a private club\" for good reasons. It\u2019s taken from a couple of comments describing now largely defunct networks, but the divisions still exist, even if they are differently marked these days. Science bloggers can be snobby and have their own little sub-groups. They can be unintentionally exclusive. They also fall out and they argue. Oh, how they can argue. That the community was up for a fight was maybe most noticeable in the \u201cPepsigate\u201d affair where a load of bloggers, angered at the group which ran their network, up and left. There have been many other small fights though too, and the intersection of science blogging with mainstream media has offered a powerful layer of self-critique on the latter (though some argue science blogging has been co-opted by mainstream media, and I have some sympathy with that, whilst also typing this to the Guardian CMS\u2026). Last week several of the blogposts criticising Scientific American for its treatment of DNLee were hosted on the network itself (Janet Stemwedel, for example). It\u2019s become a running joke that the Guardian runs bad science only to have it\u2019s bloggers debunk it, collecting twice the hits as they go (I couldn\u2019t possibly speak to the validity of this). But a lot of the strength to do this sort of critical action comes from the community, with mutual support and a sense of solidarity and friendship, even when you don\u2019t always agree. When I was doing some empirical research on science bloggers a few years ago, many of the people I interviewed reflected on the feeling of community, and often cited Bora Zivkovic as key to the development of this feeling. He had been great at helping encourage new bloggers but also help connect bloggers with each other, partly through the Science Online conferences, but through a lot of smaller actions too, from tweets to blogposts to personal introductions. But then writer and playwright Monica Byrne's accused Zivkovic of sexual harassment. He offered a brief apology and many took that as enough. But there were comments under Byrne\u2019s blog suggesting it wasn\u2019t one off. Then science journalist Priya Shetty wrote a powerful piece on \u201cthe deafening silence\u201d that condones sexual harassment. Roger Pielke Jr called out Andrew Maynard\u2019s behaviour in pressuring Byrne to remove any reference to Zivkovic because he is \u201chighly respected within the community\u201d. To repeat Pielke, \u201cAck\u201d. Hannah Walters offered her own experience, making an important point about the insidious power of not-quite-harassment too. And things felt very different. So now the critique and self-reflexivity of the science blogging community which has long been part of its lifeblood is directed at something very close to its soul. And people are a bit confused about how to feel or what to do. And yet, because the community, there is a strength here too. Brave women are speaking up and in doing so helping others do similarly. Men are supporting them too, and there is a lot of learning happening all over the place. And I am thinking about how much of the power of the science blogging community has always been the community, not a singular character, powerful as such characters can be. I hope everyone involved continues to be brave, to support each other and learn from one another, including learning from disagreeing with one another. Most of all though, I hope this power spreads beyond the science blogging community. Because this sort of behaviour is in science journalism and it\u2019s in science itself, just as it\u2019s rife in many other places beside. Ladybits have issued a call for submissions on the power of harassment. I look forward to seeing what new power it brings.
