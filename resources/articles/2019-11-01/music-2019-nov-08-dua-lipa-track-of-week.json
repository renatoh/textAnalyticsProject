Well, her disco bop Don\u2019t Start Now has loads more \u2013 the new New Rules, if you will. Don\u2019t want to see her dancing with somebody? Don\u2019t show up. Don\u2019t come out. Don\u2019t start caring about her now. Walk away and again: don\u2019t start caring about her now. Clear? In Dua Lipa\u2019s extremely strict regime, basically all you are allowed to do is sit inside and watch Netflix, which is sort of what everyone\u2019s planning on from now until March 2020 anyway. Lola Young 6 Feet Under Eighteen-year-old Lola Young\u2019s debut single is all about being \u201cyoung, in love and dumb\u201d and perfectly encapsulates the teenage emotion of \u201cif he doesn\u2019t love me back, I may as well be dead\u201d. You remember: you\u2019d lie on your bed and think about your crush constantly before kicking off at your mum for calling you down for dinner when you\u2019re LITERALLY DYING UP HERE. Then, after three weeks of staring at his social media, you accidentally run into him at a party, realise he\u2019s also just an insecure teenager like you, and never want to see him again. Anyway, this song is that, but much cooler. Sam Smith I Feel Love Sam Smith\u2019s new single is a cover of Donna Summer\u2019s I Feel Love. So what can we say? I Feel Love is an established banger and this is pretty much a carbon copy of the original, only at a more radio-friendly three minutes and 20 seconds. So well done to Sam Smith on what is essentially a high-end karaoke session. La Roux International Woman of Leisure Don\u2019t let the Austin Powers-style title put you off: International Woman of Leisure isn\u2019t a job ad for a travel influencer; it\u2019s an upbeat, bouncy, joyful break-up anthem about dumping someone and going on holiday. The lyric \u201cNow I can feel the change in the weather/ Oh where I\u2019m goin\u2019 I know it\u2019s much better\u201d is quite smug, but it\u2019s also the perfect post-split, sun lounger-shot Instagram caption. AJ Tracey &amp; Skepta Kiss and Tell AJ Tracey and Skepta\u2019s first collaboration is all about keeping your hook-ups secret but, to be honest, they\u2019re not doing that well. Kiss and Tell is a list of what to expect from a date with them: shopping on Bond Street, booze, a phone call from Skepta\u2019s accountant questioning where all his money\u2019s going and a variety of sex acts while wearing Nike Air Max. Specific, and quite frankly exhausting. We\u2019ll pass, thanks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
