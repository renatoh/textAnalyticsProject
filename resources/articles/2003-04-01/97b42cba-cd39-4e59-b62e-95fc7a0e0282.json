Bosnich has always maintained that he never knowingly took drugs and has claimed before an FA disciplinary panel that his drink was spiked at a nightclub by a woman. She was tracked down and interviewed by Bosnich's legal team and is believed to have given sworn statements saying she accidentally spiked the then Chelsea goalkeeper's drink at the Wellington club in Knightsbridge, London. She apparently said she was in the habit of taking cocaine by pouring it into her own glass and that somehow her glass was mixed up with that of Bosnich, who downed her drink by mistake. The FA will impose a global ban of up to two years on Bosnich if the panel does not accept his explanation of how the drug got into his system. He would have a right of appeal and could ultimately take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. He has been suspended from the game since he tested positive for cocaine last year. Chelsea terminated the former Aston Villa and Manchester United player's \u00a342,000-a-week contract in January. He is awaiting another hearing after appealing against a Premier League ruling that Chelsea's decision to terminate his contract did not amount to unfair dismissal. The case will be heard by the Football League appeals committee. Bosnich would have been guaranteed a way back into the sport had he admitted to taking cocaine and agreed to undergo rehabilitation but he has been determined to prove his innocence and his private hearing at the FA is expected to conclude this afternoon. He has been charged with breaching doping regulations and bringing the game into disrepute. Uefa is introducing a \"silver goal\" rule for next month's Champions League and Uefa Cup finals, scrapping the \"golden goal\" rule in extra-time. Whereas a golden goal immediately ended matches deadlocked after 90 minutes, the new rule stipulates play should continue until the end of the half in which an extra-time goal is scored. If a match remains a draw after both 15-minute periods it will be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Tickets for the Euro 2004 finals are now on sale on the internet in what Portuguese organisers vowed would be a \"fair and transparent\" process. Until June 16, forms on the www.euro2004.com site may be used to apply for up to four tickets a game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
