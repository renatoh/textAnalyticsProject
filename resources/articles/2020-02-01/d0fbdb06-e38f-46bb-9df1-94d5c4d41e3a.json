Using a now-familiar line of attack that misstates Bloomberg\u2019s 5ft 8in stature, Trump tweeted: \u201cMini Mike is a 5\u20194\u201d mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. No boxes please.\u201d In a subsequent salvo Trump compared Bloomberg to his 2016 Republican nomination challenger Jeb Bush. \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but can\u2019t debate and has zero presence, you will see. He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb \u2018Low Energy\u2019 Bush, but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini!\u201d Twenty minutes later, Bloomberg returned fire, drawing attention to doubts that Trump is not as wealthy or as successful as he likes to portray himself. \u201c@realDonaldTrump \u2013 we know many of the same people in NY. Behind your back they laugh at you &amp; call you a carnival barking clown,\u201d Bloomberg said in a posting. \u201cThey know you inherited a fortune &amp; squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence.\u201d Bloomberg, whose wealth Forbes estimates at $61.8bn, continued: \u201cI have the record &amp; the resources to defeat you. And I will.\u201d The financial data businessman has spent at least $350m on his campaign to date and said he plans to spend up to $1bn on the race. The two wealthy New Yorkers are honing their attacks as a once cordial relationship turns toxic. For more than a decade, the two businessmen appeared on friendly terms at charity golf tournaments, ribbon cuttings events and even on Trump\u2019s reality TV show. Forbes estimates Trump\u2019s wealth to be $3.1bn, or 1/20th of Bloomberg\u2019s fortune, with little of that in liquid assets. A New York Times analysis estimates the Trump re-election campaign or its associated committees raised $154m in the last three months of 2019 and have $195m on hand. In contrast, Bloomberg has said he is open to spending $1bn to defeat Trump and has swamped America\u2019s airwaves and social media with campaign ads \u2013 far outspending any other Democratic rival. But it is on the free social media platform of Twitter that the two men\u2019s rivalry has the sharpest elbows. After audiotape was leaked earlier this week of Bloomberg praising \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing tactics while mayor of New York \u2013 a discriminatory policy he now disavows \u2013 Trump called him a \u201cTOTAL RACIST\u201d in a Twitter post that was later taken down. In his response, Bloomberg accused the president of attacking him because of his \u201cfear over the growing strength of my campaign\u201d. He continued: \u201cMake no mistake, Mr. President: I am not afraid of you, and I will not let you bully me or anyone else in America.\u201d The following day, Bloomberg tweeted again: \u201cDonald Trump is the world\u2019s biggest schoolyard bully \u2013 with no respect for civility or decency, or facts or honesty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
