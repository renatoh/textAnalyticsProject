Writer-director Mark O'Connor aims for authenticity, tying the Travellers to those other migrant labourers persecuted by locals. Yet he stumbles over a vein of notionally crowd-pleasing comedy that recalls Guy Ritchie's Snatch, with its gold-chained chancers doing mushrooms in the woods. A flibbertigibbet: it arrives with a twinkle in its eye, but little else between its cauliflower ears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
