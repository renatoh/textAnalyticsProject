Three large landowners have confirmed that their tenants are no longer allowed to burn heather routinely. The ban is a blow to grouse shoots, which burn older heather to make way for younger, more nutritious plants for grouse to feed on, but environmental groups say the practice harms the environment. Research by the University of Leeds has found that burning grouse moors degrades peatland habitat, releases climate-altering gases, reduces biodiversity and increases flood risk. Last year, the Observer reported that Yorkshire Water was reviewing each of its grouse-shooting leases amid concerns about the practice of routine burning. The company says has written into its lease a presumption against burning as a land management technique. United Utilities is also altering its leases to shorter terms, with a similar review to Yorkshire Water\u2019s expected. Last month, it confirmed to the campaign group Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire\u2019s Moors (BBYM) that it now prohibits routine burning on its land. And three estates overseen by the National Trust \u2013 Marsden, Braithwaite Hall and Dark Peak \u2013 also told the group that tenants were no longer allowed to conduct routine burning. Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning. A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.\u201d Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. \u201cYorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,\u201d said Luke Steele of BBYM. Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice. And the committee on climate change has recommended that a grouse-moor burning ban be introduced within the year. But owners of large grouse moors have threatened legal action if such a ban is introduced. The issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus outbreak. Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice. The National Trust said: \u201cWe are keen to alleviate pressure on the emergency services, and are working with estate managers and tenants to ensure any burning is stopped immediately.\u201d The move follows requests from emergency services and local councils, which fear that burning increases the risk of wildfires, and that fumes might affect people suffering from Covid-19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
