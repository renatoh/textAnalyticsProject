Another group stood nearby on the corner of Medina Road; another loitered outside the tower blocks of the Six Acres estate. \u201cYou see? They have taken over the streets,\u201d said Fawzia Addou, one of a group of mothers escorting the Observer around the streets of Finsbury Park, north London. The mothers, dressed in disguise, were pointing out the drug-dealing spots where their sons worked. The dealers were everywhere. Behind Rowans bowling alley, outside the newsagent\u2019s by the tube, at the top of Finsbury Park Road. A pre-eminent location is the bus stop opposite City and Islington College. The mothers cannot understand why the drug trade is so brazen. They say the police know all about the locations because they have repeatedly told officers. But those who could identify their teenage sons were almost grateful. Many other children, aged under 16, have simply disappeared. Some emerge weeks later, hungry, exhausted. Some have been stabbed and are visibly traumatised. They are the victims of \u201ccounty lines\u201d, a drug distribution system in which criminal networks exploit thousands of children and vulnerable adults to funnel hard drugs from cities to towns and rural regions across the country, often using the public transport network to move their illicit wares. The youngsters transporting the drugs are recruited by ruthless criminal organisations, who target them with a mixture of financial rewards and threats, often finding recruits outside schools or the pupil referral units to which they have been sent after being excluded from mainstream schools. The destabilising influence of the county lines system has helped to drive fatal stabbings to the highest levels since records began. The mounting death toll has become increasingly politicised over the past week with crisis meetings between the home secretary and police chiefs, warnings of a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and Theresa May pledging an emergency summit on the issue. But the controversy has changed little on the streets around the Andover estate. The mothers, all Somalis who fled their country during the civil war in the 1990s, say they have been abandoned by the state. Many of their children, they reveal, have asked to leave London because of the violence or have been sent to Africa for their own protection. \u201cWe are refugees, if we cannot keep our children safe, we move on,\u201d said Kameela Khalif. Community representatives estimate that hundreds of British teenagers have left for Somaliland or Somalia \u2013 a country that in the past week has seen car bombings, US airstrikes and a deadly siege \u2013 because the UK has become too perilous. Beyond its medieval centre, past St Benedict\u2019s church and the cobbled lanes, the west side of Norwich yields to a network of housing estates. Here, among the streets of Heigham Grove, children from N4 \u2013 the postcode of Finsbury Park \u2013 have been discovered working county lines. According to the latest police assessment, there are 27 county lines currently operating into Norfolk, most from London and most affecting Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King\u2019s Lynn. A \u201chostile\u201d strategy towards the drugs gangs, Operation Gravity, has seen 1,024 people arrested in Norfolk since November 2016. Analysis of these arrests produced a striking theme \u2013 the minority were locals. More than 800, in fact, did not have a Norfolk postcode. Of 18 girls, only three were from the county. Further investigation found 500 gang members from London or elsewhere had recently left a criminal \u201cfootprint\u201d inside Norfolk. \u201cIt was a bit of an eye opener,\u201d said Sonia Humphreys, chief inspector of Norfolk Constabulary. Most children from London arrive into Norfolk by train. Those from Finsbury Park and Islington, whose mosaic of multi-ethnic gangs include Easy Cash, Kelly Gang and Andover Boys \u2013 named after the estate \u2013 travel from King\u2019s Cross direct to King\u2019s Lynn. Further east across the capital a competing Somali-led gang, the Mali Boys, uses Liverpool Street station to travel direct to Norwich. The Mali Boys, run by Somali \u201colders\u201d, are symbolic of a new wave of commercially aggressive county lines operations which have attempted to gain a Norwich foothold. \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve seen a lot of violence when the Somalis come up,\u201d said Humphreys. Transport police are briefed to look out for young black children travelling alone to Norfolk, often using first class, often paying with cash. Gangs are increasingly aware such journeys can seem conspicuous. \u201cWhite British children are now being targeted because gangs perceive they are more likely to evade police detection,\u201d states an internal Norfolk police document. Although Norwich teenagers are increasingly joining county lines operations, recruits largely remain inner-city children exported elsewhere. Last Wednesday, another seven Somali mothers gathered inside an Islington community centre to discuss their \u201clost generation\u201d. Rakhia Ismail, deputy mayor of Islington and a councillor for Holloway Road, is counselling 15 mothers who have lost sons to county lines and has dozens more terrified about trafficking. Addou, part of a network of 13 parents whose children have been taken by drug gangs, estimated that half \u2013 possibly as much of 70% \u2013 of Islington\u2019s Somali community had been directly impacted by knife crime and county lines. \u201cThe ones not affected are worried because they\u2019re next,\u201d she said. Addou\u2019s son has been found in King\u2019s Lynn four times. Groomed by gangs in a football park outside his school, the first time he disappeared she traced him to a local dealer. \u201cHe said that he couldn\u2019t come home until Tuesday. They were holding him.\u201d She sent the 15-year-old to Somalia then Kenya. Sahra Amburo, a prominent member of N4\u2019s Somali community, told how her 15-year-old was top of his class, a risk factor in itself because gangs target the most intelligent or popular, knowing friends will follow. Her son vanished one Sunday afternoon in 2017. After obtaining his phone records, she tracked him to Essex where he was being held by a group of dealers. She flew him immediately to Somaliland. \u201cI took him away otherwise he would have been killed because they knew our address,\u201d she said. Another described how she learned her 16-year-old son had been taken to Hemel Hempstead. She pasted dozens of posters of his face across the Hertfordshire town. After three days the gang handed him over. \u201cStraightaway he said \u2018please take me away from this country\u2019.\u201d Last Wednesday, a new development tormented the group. One of their sons, aged 19, who had been sent to Kenya for safety, was being enticed by a gang via Snapchat to return to N4. \u201cThe drug dealers want him. If he returns I will lose him,\u201d said Iana Ali. On Friday, she flew to Mombasa to persuade him to stay. When a teenager was fatally stabbed earlier this year, 300 metres from the centre, the deceased\u2019s 15-year-old Somali friend was told he was next. Within two days his mother put him on a one-way ticket to Mogadishu. \u201cNow he\u2019s walking the land, living free,\u201d she said. All the mothers have learned that county lines necessitates violence. Exploited children hoping to rise up the criminal foodchain must exhibit escalating brutality. Nick Davison, assistant chief constable of Norfolk Constabulary, outlined the concept of \u201cultra-violence\u201d where younger recruits maintain status by executing acts of increasingly outrageous savagery. Beatings turn to stabbings in the buttock, then the chest, the face. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you become vulnerable to becoming a victim of that behaviour,\u201d said Davison. Internal police documents confirm endemic violence \u2013 \u201c85% of forces report knives referenced in relation to county lines intelligence, 74% report firearms referenced\u201d. Children who attempt to escape are tortured. A 16-year-old reported missing from London was found by Norfolk police in possession of a 6in kitchen knife and 30 wraps of drugs. In custody they also discovered his body was covered with scarring \u201cconsistent with having been burnt with boiling liquid\u201d. And the gangs have long memories. The mother who rescued her child from Hemel Hempstead allowed him to return to London in November 2017, assuming he would be safe. Within days of arriving he was stabbed in the stomach, his assailant wiggling the blade inside the body to cause maximum harm. After 40 days in hospital he returned home and has not left since. \u201cBoth my sons are too scared to leave the house,\u201d she said. The family has received no counselling or trauma aftercare. Others take drastic measures. One London gang member, stabbed multiple times, turned to religion to escape. Norfolk officers subsequently discovered he had travelled to fight in Syria. The lack of safety has provoked outrage. \u201cWe parents are fighting a war with the gangs to save our children,\u201d said Khalif. They argue that their sons have been denied a statutory right to a safe environment. \u201cThe government must take responsibility,\u201d said mother-of-seven Addou. When her son was caught, he refused bail because it was safer in prison. Others complain their probation prevents them from leaving the country. The mothers ridiculed Theresa May\u2019s claim last week that there is \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between crime and police numbers. Davison, although more circumspect, agreed that austerity and the state\u2019s inability to provide security outside the family had been adeptly \u201cexploited\u201d by criminals. The mothers\u2019 deepest gripe is police apathy. They, along with many in the community, have shared detailed intelligence with police. Since 2015, addresses, locations and movements of individuals have been offered that they say connect county line operations to its \u201cgenerals\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve told the police so many times but now I\u2019ve stopped. I expect it be acted on, or at least given some feedback. It\u2019s one-way communication,\u201d said Addou. The Islington Somali Community (ISC) complains that eight neighbourhood police serve a ward, Finsbury Park, which has a population of 17,200. Dealing spots, others say, lie within an area of concentrated CCTV coverage. The breakdown in trust is so great that unsupported claims of collusion flourish. \u201cSome parents believe that some police are working with the gangs because nothing is done,\u201d said Ali. There is also disquiet over the genesis of the latest political furore over knife crime, in particular that it took the death of a white teenager to prompt the outrage. \u201cIt is absolutely tragic but it has taken a white girl to get killed for this to top the political agenda,\u201d said Kalyfa Ismail. A year ago three Somali youngsters in nearby Camden were knifed in 24 hours; two died and one just survived. \u201cWhere was the emergency summit then?\u201d said Addou. Another burning issue is the increasing evidence linking school exclusion rates and gang recruitment. Excluded pupils are 200 times more likely to receive a knife-carrying offence. Abdiwahab Ali, director of the Somali Youth Development Resource Centre (SYDRC), is conducting pioneering research into the issue. Early estimates suggest half of Somali origin children excluded permanently in Camden enter the criminal justice system. Then there are the \u201cunits\u201d \u2013 the pupil referral units accused of being fertile grounds for gang recruitment. Ismail described gang members waiting in lines outside Islington\u2019s unit. Bilan Hoseen, who works with excluded Somali teenagers, said many are too petrified to attend the local unit. \u201cThey get a taxi there because they feel too unsafe to walk,\u201d he said. Officers in Norfolk view its smattering of units as so vulnerable they have flagged concerns with the council and are seeking to embed officers inside. Secondary schools have also been targeted by police with 10 of Norfolk\u2019s 50 sites having a dedicated officer to spot vulnerable children. \u201cThrough this we have discovered kids who have gone missing from high school in Norwich travelling to London to pick up drugs to support county lines activities,\u201d said Davison. The exploitation of thousands of children provides the labour for county lines. Latest figures for the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), the government system to identify trafficking victims, revealed drug gangs helped prompt a 66% increase to 2,118 cases in 2017. But first the children must be groomed. They are usually targeted between the ages of 13 and 14, with the optimum age for recruitment of 15 to 16. Addou said the gang gave her football-mad son a new ball and the offer of protection. Months later he was running drugs in Norfolk. A caged artificial-turf pitch, 100 metres from Andover\u2019s central square, is a well-known recruitment ground for N4 county lines operations. One mother on the Andover estate said her nine-year-old son was already receiving money for sweets from gangs. Others describe 14-year-olds wanting to \u201cdo Deliveroo\u201d when they turn 16, a euphemism for couriering drugs. Fast food joints in Finsbury Park are targeted by gang recruiters. In Norwich, officers are told to be vigilant in shopping centres. Recruiters, said Humphreys, seek a \u201cchink in the armour\u201d of adolescents using techniques indistinguishable from child abusers. Internal briefings by police forces have highlighted video interviews conducted by youth worker Paul McKenzie with gang recruiters. \u201cIt\u2019s like listening to an exploiter of sexual abuse,\u201d said Humphreys. Once hooked, their families are threatened with violence or they are trapped through debt bondage. Although a county line can make a gang up to \u00a35,000 a day, mothers say there is scant evidence of wealth distribution. \u201cOur boys come home hungry, tired, cold. They are still growing, their clothes no longer fit.\u201d Both Norfolk\u2019s senior officers and Islington\u2019s Somali mothers concur that the solution requires ambition. Davison, whose force has closed down 21 county lines, agrees the answer is bigger than the level of policing. \u201cWe will not arrest our way out of county lines. It needs a whole system approach, offering young people alternatives,\u201d he said. Beyond removing children from the country, the mothers list various solutions; more parental involvement in schools; safe spaces; more vocational education; a deradicalisation programme for groomed children. In the absence of a concerted new approach, both police and parents know that the teenagers of N4 will continue to surface in Norwich while their younger brothers on the Andover estate receive new gifts from the guys in the square.
