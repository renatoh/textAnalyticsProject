He said that the government are exploring various options to come up with a solution that would mitigate against a bank run when the banks open again. Here's one of his last quotes: If we cannot come up the \u20ac5.8bn in a few days then I think we will go to the Cyprus pound. That will be the end of Cyprus in the Eurozone. And on that note we're going to wrap up the blog for now. Thanks for tuning in. A contingency plan to introduce capital controls in Cyprus is being discussed by authorities on the island and European officials, according to the Wall St Journal: The plan includes imposing limits on daily withdrawals from bank accounts; capping the amount of money that can be electronically taken out of the country and making these transactions slower to clear; and introducing border checks to cap the amount of cash leaving in the country. A 45-word statement has been released by the Eurogroup's president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem: I take note of the decision of the Cypriot parliament on the government's proposal for a one-off stability levy. I confirm that the Eurogroup stands ready to assist Cyprus in its reform efforts and reiterate the position of the Eurogroup as I stated yesterday. Cue the Twitter reaction: Turning for a moment to another small island economy to suffer a banking meltdown: Nine former senior staff of Kaupthing bank have been variously charged in Iceland with orchestrating five large-scale market manipulation conspiracies. Among them is Icelandic banker Sigurdur \"Siggi\" Einarsson, who ran Kaupthing from offices in London's Mayfair until its collapse five years ago. Simon Bowers has the story here: Further details, to be released by the courts later this week, are expected to allege a conspiracy by Kaupthing executive chairman Einarsson and other bosses at Iceland's largest bank, claiming they secretly used the bank's funds to indirectly buy Kaupthing shares in the hope of propping up its share price. You can read a comprehensive piece on today's dramatic developments in Cyprus now by Angelique Chrisafis, who is in Nicosia, and Jill Treanor, the Guardian's City Editor, here. A snatch: The Cypriot parliament has thrown out a controversial plan to skim \u20ac5.8bn from savers' bank accounts, in a move that risks plunging the eurozone into a fresh crisis and heightens expectations that the cash-strapped nation will seek a funding lifeline from Russia. Cyprus has just 24 hours to find a solution to its funding gap before its banks are due to reopen following the dramatic no vote on Tuesday night, which failed to support a hastily renegotiated change to the original deal. Just to recap: The 56-member Cypriot parliament rejected the bank tax by 36 votes with 19 abstentions (one MP was absent) even after the proposal had been tweaked during the day to remove any levy on savings below \u20ac20,000. Accounts holding \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac100,000 still faced a 6.75% levy, and any account with more than \u20ac100,000 a tax of 9.9%, despite calls by Cyprus's eurozone partners not to tax accounts below \u20ac100,000 \u2013 the level at which a European Union-wide guarantee kicks in if an EU bank goes bust. A plane carrying \u20ac1m has landed in Cyrprus this evening as part of contingency plans for Britain's armed forces personnel and their families. Here's a statement from the Ministry of Defence: An RAF flight left for Cyprus this afternoon with \u20ac1M on board as a contingency measure to provide military personnel and their families with emergency loans. This is a contingency measure only. The MoD is giving its personnel the option of having their salaries paid into UK bank accounts. We\u2019re determined to do everything we can to minimise the impact of the Cyprus banking crisis on our people. The money will be used in the event of the ATMs not giving out any cash. This is Ben Quinn dipping into the blog by the way. Graeme has gone home to get a some shut-eye before tomorrow's UK budget coverage Update, the report that Cyprus's banks might not open until next Tuesday comes from Dow Jones Newswires, which also has information that capital controls might be imposed to prevent cash leaving the country (sorry I don't have more info than that yet) A quick summary of the state of play (and some help on where to look in the live blog to find more) \u2022 Cyprus has sensationally rejected the terms of its bailout, with 36 MPs voting against the plan, and 19 government MPs abstaining (see here onwards for details) The vote came after a dramatic debate, in which politicians were deeply critical of the bailout plan and tax on savers, warning it would destroy Cyprus's economy (see here onwards for highlights). \u2022 Analysts believe Cyprus has four options, including demanding new terms from the eurozone or a new deal with Russia (see here for details). \u2022 There are reports that the country's banks might remain closed until next week, to avoid the risk of a bank run. \u2022 There has also been celebrations in Cyprus, where protesters sang and changed as their politicians voted down the unpopular bailout (see here onwards) \u2022 The rejection came despite Cyprus's government changing the terms of its tax levy, to protect accounts with less than \u20ac20,000 (see our lunchtime summary). There are reports tonight that Cyprus's banks could remain closed until next Tuesday - rather then re-opening on Thursday as planned. Here's some detailed analysis from our economics editor, Larry Elliott: It must have seemed so simple for the politicians and officials who pieced together the bail out plan for Cyprus announced last weekend. One of the smaller euro zone countries, Cyprus had become the money-laundering centre of choice for Russian oligarchs and there was no way Angela Merkel was going to agree to a blueprint that would see German taxpayers subsidising Moscow billionaires, especially with an election looming this Autumn. So bank depositors in Cyprus would be obliged to pony up one euro for every two provided by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with the levy imposed across the board. Cyprus was a special case, it was insisted, and therefore there would be no knock-on effects to the rest of the euro zone. The notion that the Cypriot parliament would reject the proposal was not factored into the calculations, a fatal flaw in what one City analyst compared to one the \u201ccunning plans\u201d conjured up by Baldrick in the Blackadder series. Other commentators were less inclined to see the funny side of what is clearly an escalating crisis. One said it was the opening of Pandora\u2019s Box; another saw events in the eastern Mediterranean country as the equivalent of the assassination of archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo. So what happens next? Forget some of the more far-fetched scenarios being mooted yesterday. Cypriot MPs voted down the idea of tax on bank deposits as a condition of a bail out last night and they are unlikely to have a crash re-think given the public fury at the raid on their savings. Vladimir Putin is not going to come to the rescue with some cash from the Kremlin - though there were rumours last night that state-controlled energy company Gazprom might rescue the most troubled bank in return for seizing control of the island\u2019s potentially lucrative gas reserves. But this is not one of the times when Europe can kick the can down the road, hoping that all will be well in time. Instead, there are really only two plausible scenarios: somebody - be it Europe or the IMF - gives Cyprus more money, in which case there is a chance that the crisis can be contained. Or Germany and the other hardline euro zone countries can insist that the deal is non-negotiable. In which case, the banks in Cyprus will go bust, risking widespread turmoil. Given the precarious euro zone economy and the enfeebled state of European banks, cutting Cyprus a better deal looks like the safer option. The package could be restructured so that only deposits in excess of \u20ac100,000 were taxed, the preferred option of Christine Lagarde at the IMF. Sparing those with savings of less than \u20ac100,000 from any pain would require the bigger depositors to pay a 15.5% tax to find the \u20ac5.8bn demanded of Cyprus. Alternatively, Europe could easily find the extra \u20ac5.8bn itself. The problem is that both options will cause political problems. Putin will bridle at suggestions that Russian citizens - who make up a large proportion of the \u20ac100,000 depositors - should be singled out. And Merkel could expect an almighty domestic backlash if she backtracked from the tough stance she adopted at the weekend. But the alternative is to let the banks in Cyprus go bust as soon as they are reopened after the extended bank holiday and hope that it really is a \u201cspecial case\u201d. That looks like an awfully big gamble. Alexander Stubb, Finland's minister for foreign affairs, has reacted to the events in Cyprus, tweeting: There's a lot of speculation over potential scenarios for Cyprus now. Here's a quick summary: 1) The eurogroup could ask Cyprus to vote again. Perhaps the terms of the savings levy could be changed again, to give more protection to smaller savers. However, it's hard to believe that would assuage the parliament's concerns 2) Cyprus could demand a better deal. President Nicos Anastasiades could return to the eurogroup, throw his hands in the air, and insist that the near \u20ac6bn shortfall in the bailout is financed by another method. Open Europe suggests some options: providing the full \u20ac17bn loan but with very long maturity and low rates; linking the repayment of the loan to future gas revenues; using the ESM or another vehicle to recapitalise banks directly; restructuring domestic bonds to extend maturity; accepting losses on some of the official loans. 3) Russia steps in. Moscow could decide to offer Cyprus more support, by relaxing its loan terms or agreeing to higher taxes on Russian deposits. There's also the rumour of Gazprom recapitalising some Cypriot banks in return for first dabs on the country's energy rights. 4) Cyprus quits the eurozone How could this happen? Well, if there's a full-blown run on the banks, then their capital reserves could be depleted quite quickly. If the ECB doesn't offer liquidity, and the banks aren't recapitalised through the bailout programme, then the banking sector could collapse. That could force the nuclear option of a new currency - and exit from the euro. The threat of option 4) makes 1), 2) and 3) much more likely, I'd suggest. There's more analysis here from Open Europe No market panic in America tonight, where the Dow Jones industrial average just closed up a measly 3.8 points at 14455. Bloomberg TV is asking whether the financial markets are 'tiring' of the latest developments in Europe. A Wall Street trader, though, flags up that volatility in the markets is rising. And Jonathan Golub, chief US Market Strategist at UBS, reckons investors have been ignoring 'tail risks', and that markets will be around 8% lower by the end of the year. Cyprus's decision to vote down the bailout has been warmly welcomed in Greece (where a series of unpopular austerity packages have been driven through parliament despite public opposition). A government spokesman said that Greece both supported and supports Cyprus's decisions. Meanwhile the the left-wing Syriza party hailed the MPs in Nicosia for delivering \"a proud 'no'\" which showed the path of \"real negotiations which was never followed from our governments\". Nicola Duke, a City trader, isn't impressed by the ECB's pledge (here) to keep supplying liquidity 'within the rules', given its threat to turn the supply off: No panic on Wall Street - where the Dow is currently down just 20 points, or 0.15%, with around 30 minutes trading left. The European Central Bank has just released a statement, saying that it remains committed to providing liquidity to Cyprus's banks 'within the existing rules' Here's the statement: The ECB takes note of the decision of the Cypriot parliament and is in contact with its troika partners The ECB reaffirms its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules. There are fears that the ECB could pull the plug on the country's two biggest banks, by terminating the support provided under its Emergency Liquidity Assistance -- on the grounds that they could be insolvent. But as the WSJ's Simon Nixon explains, Cyprus could be gambling that the ECB won't risk turning the liquidity tap off: During Friday's marathon negotiations over the current bailout proposal, ECB executive board member J\u00f6rg Asmussen made clear to President Nicos Anastasiades that failure to agree on a deal that weekend would make it impossible for the ECB to provide a further extension of ELA since ECB rules don't allow national central banks to lend to insolvent banks. But any actual decision to withdraw ELA is a matter for the ECB's Governing Council and requires two-thirds of the council's members to vote in favor. I just spoke to Yiannis Mouzakis in Cyprus, who tells me that the mood in Nicosia was \"celebratory\" after MPs sensationally voted down the bailout in the face of public anger. Judging by the singing, there was a sense of pride... But people understand it will not be easy - and that the days ahead will be difficult. Yiannis confirmed that the mood of the crowds was very different from the protests we've seen in Athens, with \"a lot of singing, and a bit of chanting\". Slogans included \"It will not pass\"; \"Cyprus belongs to the people\" and \"The people united will never be defeated\". He also believes there is little chance of Cyprus's banks reopening before next Tuesday (as Monday is a bank holiday). There's also a lot of talk on the serious news channels about the prospect of Russia now stepping in. Michalis Sarris, the Cyprus minister who denies offering to resign today, is now in Moscow for meetings tomorrow... Rumours that energy giant Gazprom has offered to restructure Cyprus' banks in exchange for natural gas exploration rights refuse to go away.... Sebastien Galy, senior currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, believes that Cyprus's government will eventually manage to hammer out a new deal, but there'll be a lot more uncertainty first: He tells me: Superficially it is negative, more practically it means we are off to the next round of negotiations which means more uncertainty and eventually some form of deal. Drama is sadly a part of the negotiation process. Fears over the eurozone crisis will keep pushing the euro down against the US dollar, he added, News that MPs had resoundingly rejected the bailout terms was greeted with applause and cries of 'bravo' from the crowds outside the Cyprus parliament, according to those at the scene. Cyprus's banks were due to open again on Thursday, but there is already speculation that the current bank holiday could be extended. Next Monday is also a scheduled bank holiday, so the prospect of a longer period of disruption is possible - as David Enrich, European banking editor for The Wall Street Journal, suggests: The euro is now down 0.8 of a cent at $1.2874, its lowest levels for three months. The single currency has been on the slide since it became clear that even the Cyprus's government wouldn't back the bailout terms. We expected MPs to reject the bailout terms, but this is still a very serious development - for Cyprus and the wider eurozone. From the voting details, it is clear that the main government MPs abstained, and everyone else voted against. BREAKING: The Cyprus parliament has rejected the bailout deal. 36 MPs voted no, and 19 abstained. Cypriots are also holding slogans in Spanish and Italian outside the Nicosia parliament, which read \"today me, tomorrow you\" (that's via university lecturer Spyros Gkelis) People are continuing to vent their anger over the Cypriot bailout -- those at the scene report that the crowds are chanting \"Only the cowards are voting for abstention\" -- referring to reports that Nicos Anastasiades's MPs will decline to vote tonight. We're still expecting a vote tonight, incidentally, although there has been talk that it will be delayed. We'll know soon enough... Just in: Cyprus's finance minister Michalis Sarris has denied resigning (following rumours that swept Cyprus and the markets this afternoon). According to Reuters, Sarris texted them to say there was \"no truth\" in the reports. The leader of DIKO, the junior coalition partner in Cyprus's government, has just torn shreds out of the bailout plan, according to Efthimia Efthimiou. Hundreds of protesters are continuing to demonstrate outside the Cypriot parliament, as MP after MP is deeply critical of the country's bailout plan. The scene in Nicosia appears calm, as night falls: And here's a photo of the protests earlier today: Just a reminder for new readers -- the deal on the table in Cyprus has been amended, so that savers with less than \u20ac20,000 in the bank are now not affected by the savings levy. That clearly hasn't been enough to satisfy Cyprus's politicians. A few more details of the ongoing debate: Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou also reports that MPs are warning that other eurozone country's could be hit by deposit taxes in future, unles Cyprus makes a stand: Some Cypriot MPs are attacking Germany for its role in the bailout, and for saying the country was a money-laundering den, according to Greek journalist Joanna Kakissis: There are also reports that the governing party, Democratic Rally (Disy), asked for the vote to be delayed until Wednesday, but were turned down. In the Nicosia parliament, a series of MPs have taken to the podium to criticise the bailout plan. The key message, according to the ever-knowledgable Theodora Oikonomides is that they are warning that the programme will destroy Cyprus's economy, so they must reject it. The debate in Cyprus is also being held in a calm manner, but you don't need to understand Greek to feel the anger that the MPs feel. It appears certain that the Cyprus parliament will reject the bailout package as it stands. A spokesperson for the governing Democratic Rally (Disy) party of President Nicos Anastasiades revealed before the debate started that its MPs have decided to abstain, rather than support the package. With the rest of the parliament expected to vote against it, this is a major display of defiance from Nicosia against the eurozone. The debate over the Cyprus bailout package, and the savings levy, has begun in Nicosia. You can watch it live here (no translation). Britain has just sent an aeroplane carrying one million euros to Cyprus as a\"contingency measure\" to help troops and their families. The move (which sounds like the start of a Hollywood heist), is an attempt to make sure military personal won't run out of cash if ATM machines and bank cards stop workinh Further plans could be sent too. PA says the Ministry of Defence is determined to minimise the impact of the Cyprus banking crisis on \"our people\" and it will consider further shipments if required. Protests are underway outside the Cyprus parliament in Nicosia, ahead of tonight's debate and vote on the bailout package. People at the scene report that the crowds are chanting slogans, includign \"Independence, freedom, democracy\", and A sudden sell-off has wiped half a cent off the value of the euro, sending it down to $1.289 against the US dollar. Two rumours, both currently unsubstantiated, are to blame. 1) that the Cypriot finance minister Michalis Sarris, has offered to resign, but has had the offer rejected by president Anastasiades. This is running on several newswires, but we don't yet have any official confirmation. 2) That the vote on the bailout package will go ahead tonight, but that the government MPs will not support the plan, meaning it certainly fails. That's via the BBC's Athens correspondent, Mark Owen. Earlier today Anthanasios Orphanides, the former central bank governor, told Bloomberg TV that the EU was making 'a mockery' of its banking union plans, and blackmailing Cyprus. Here's a video clip: and here are some key quotes: \"We are witnessing historic times. What we are witnessing is the slow death of the European Project. We are in a situation that some European governments are essentially taking actions that are telling citizens of other member states that they are not equal under the law.\" \"What we have seen in the last few days is a very serious blunder by European governments that are essentially blackmailing the government of Cyprus to confiscate the money that belongs rightfully to depositors in the banking sector in Cyprus. It is not clear how this can affect in a positive matter the European project going forward.\" The latest word from Nicosia is that this afternoon's debate will go ahead, according to Sandra Gathmann of Feature Story, who flags up that there are riot police outside the parliament to keep order. Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades is due hold more negotiations with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, over the bailout deal. Government spokesman Christos Stylianides announced the plan in a statement, saying: Last night the president had a telephone conversation with... Mrs Merkel whom he briefed about the current situation in Cyprus. The president informed the chancellor that the possibility was considered to cut the loan needs through Cypriot funds The president of the republic is expected to have another conversation with Mrs Merkel today and he will continue his contacts with other leaders as well. No other European country will be forced to impose losses on its savers, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem insisted earlier today. Dijsselbloem, the newish head of the Eurogroup (which helped shape the Cyprus bailout), told the Dutch parliament that there was no chance of a repeat elsewhere in the eurocrisis. Reuters has the quotes: \"It is absolutely out of the question, there is no need for a one-off levy in other countries on assets,\" Dijsselbloem said in the Dutch parliament. He reiterated that because of the size of the Cypriot banking sector and its recapitalisation needs, it was inevitable that depositors had to be called on to help. As mentioned earlier, Dijsselbloem announced last night that Cyprus should rework its savings levy to make it fairer - which led to today's proposal to protect deposits of less than \u20ac20,000. Incidentally.... in the comments below Masistios argues that the EU has been unfairly criticised over the decision to tax all savers, writing: Suggesting that the decision to break the 100,000 euro guarantee was \u2018forced\u2019 on the Cypriots by the EU and that once the precedent has been set \"by the EU\" that it could be rolled out to other countries, is just sordid, nasty little anti-European propaganda. To be honest, since Saturday there has been confusion, claim, and counter-claim over who said what and did what during the Cyprus negotiations. But our inside report from last night explains that the Cypriot government was forced to raise billions of euros from savers, and took the decision to not simply whack the rich: Various formulas and calculations were kicked around, with the Germans and the IMF demanding much bigger taxes on savers' deposits, the commission seeking modest contributions from savers with less than \u20ac100,000 and Anastasiades said to be keener on spreading the burden, fearful of scaring off the wealthy Russians with too punitive levies. They use Cyprus as a holiday, property, and banking paradise. Anastasiades balked at anything over 10% for the wealthy, said EU sources, and settled on the symbolic figure of a 9.9% \"tax\" on depositors with more than \u20ac100,000. That meant the rest of the \u20ac5.8bn had to come from the more modest savers, at a one-off rate of 6.75%. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Greece's opposition Syriza party, has called for the Greek parliament to hold an emergency debate on the crisis in Cyprus. He also criticised prime minister Antonis Samaras for failing to summon MPs back yesterday (a bank holiday in Greece as well as Cyprus), and accused the Greek leader of being \u201cafraid of Parliament, afraid of people, afraid of light.\u201d Here's the details, via Kathimerini: Making a brief televised address on Tuesday, Tsipras repeated the request for a parliamentary debate on the consequences of the deposit tax proposed in Cyprus. The SYRIZA leader labelled the measure \u201ccolonial\u201d and said Cyprus\u2019s refusal to approve it so far showed that there was room for bailout countries to engage in tougher negotiations with their lenders. Syriza has also organised a 'solidarity rally' in Athens tonight, to show support for Cypriots (6pm local time, or 4pm GMT, or noon if you're on the East Coast of the US) Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett, reports that Spain's largest companies say it's 'business as usual' despite the Cyprus crisis. Giles writes: I am at a rather optimistic presentation by some of Spain's largest companies of what they claim are investment opportunities in the country. The companies insist that they are not worried about the Cyprus situation, with Cesar Alierta - chairman of telecoms giant Telefonica - saying that their investor relations department has not received any queries about it at all. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alvarez, a vice president of the Santander bank, says that, despite the fall in banking shares, there is little threat of contagion. Cyprus, he claims, is virtually an offshore banking centre. \"The nature of the Spanish or Italian banking system is very different,\" he says. Here's a quick round-up of the situation in Cyprus \u2022 Cyprus has amended the terms of its controversial savings levy. Under the new proposal, savers with less than \u20ac20,000 in the bank should not see their deposits tapped to fund its bailout. The move comes after opposition MPs refused to back the plan, and demonstrations outside the parliament yesterday. Last night the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) said Cyprus should rethink the terms of the levy \u2022 But despite the change, the country's president has predicted that the bailout will be rejected this afternoon. MPs believe the terms are unfair, he told reporters (watch the clip here). \u2022 A draft bill has been presented to parliament, to be voted on at 4pm GMT.... \u2022 ...however there are reports that the vote will be delayed again (see here). We should know in the next hour or so.... \u2022 Russia has escalated the pressure on Cyprus, warning that the savings levy could prompt the collapse of the Cypriot banking sector. Russia's envoy to the EU echoed president Putin's criticism yesterday, and warned of possible social unrest and bank runs (see here) \u2022 The financial markets remain calm this lunchtime, with shares higher on Wall Street and in London, but lower in other markets. \u2022 Cypriot cash machines were working today, with customers able to withdraw funds. The banks remained closed though (see here) On Wall Street, shares have opened higher as the financial markets continue to wait and see how the crisis plays out. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62 points in early trading to 14514, up 0.4%. And in London, the FTSE 100 is now in positive territory, up 9 points at 6567. It's calm, but some traders and economists remain concerned over how the Cyprus crisis will play out: Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities, for example, is concerned by Russia's unhappiness over the bailout (see the Russian envoy's warnings this morning): He told clients: It has long been a German sticking-point that there could be no bailout for Cyprus unless depositors with that country\u2019s stricken banks defrayed part of the cost. But when almost half the deposits in Cypriot banks are Russian-owned, it ought to have been clear to euro zone ministers from the outset that they would not be able to take unilateral decisions over the fate of those deposits without incurring consequences. If the Russian Government had been involved in the bailout talks from the outset, bail-in arrangements for Russian depositors in Cypriot banks might have been negotiable. Instead, Moscow was presented with a fait accompli. President Putin is well known to be sensitive to slights to Russia\u2019s world-power status. His sharp reaction to the Cyprus bailout news was no surprise. He can be expected to take every opportunity to humiliate the euro zone authorities from now on. This could become an important consideration, with the Cypriot finance minister due in Moscow later this week. The decision on whether to delay today's vote on the Cypriot bank levy could be taken at a meeting of parliamentary heads this afternoon according to Cyprus newspaper Phileleftheros ( of Philenews) It reports that leaders of the various parties will gather at 5pm (3pm GMT) to discuss the situation. It adds that there is every indication of another delay (given the president's prediction of defeat - see 12.25pm). And as explained at 8.03am, Nicos Anastasiades needs to get all his MPs onside, and his coalition partner, just to tie the vote (assuming everyone shows up) The full story from Phileleftheros is here. Rumours are circulating on the newswires that this afternoon's bailout vote could be delayed until tomorrow: There were similar rumours last night.... developing. Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades, predicted earlier today that his government will be defeated in today's bailout vote - and here's a video clip of the brief interview: Asked why, Anastasiades says MPs believe the terms are \"unjust\", and \"against the interests of Cyprus at large\". He then enigmatically add that \"We have our own plans\" for what happens next. The political tensions between Europe and Russia have escalated this morning, after the Russian envoy to the European Union suggested that Cyprus's banking system could collapse. In rather blunt language for a diplomatic, Vladimir Chizhov described the bank levy as \"similar to forceful expropriation\". Speaking by video conference to reporters in Brussels, Chizhov went on to predict social unrest and bank runs in Cyprus, and perhaps beyond. Chizhov said: This decision is dangerous because of possible social repercussions in Cyprus and it is dangerous in terms of triggering possible domino effects in euro zone countries And there is another threat. When the banks open, people will rush to withdraw their deposits - that's another threat - and then the whole banking system can collapse. (quotes via Reuters) With impeccable timing, the EU is sending a delegation to Moscow later this week. Cyprus may not be on the official agenda, but the EU admitted today that Russia wants to discuss it: The euro is unbruised by the latest twists in Cyprus, flat at $1.294 against the US dollar. But as the Financial Times's currency correspondent, Alice Ross, flags up, this isn't necessarily a good sign: Open Europe, the think tank, has warned that the decision to protect Cypriot savers with less than \u20ac20,000 will not quell the political alarm. With the cat out of the bag as it were, this is unlikely to dial down frustrations or concerns significantly. This option is now on the table and the political divisions it has exposed are unlikely to be easily papered over. Despite the fact that it seems the Cypriot government played a large role in the decision to structure the tax to hit smaller depositors in the first place, the anti-German feeling seems to be rising. Meanwhile, we still believe that the position of the government \u2013 which was elected on the basis of ruling out losses for any (large or small, foreign or domestic) depositors \u2013 remains precarious. Here's their latest analysis: Eurogroup distances itself from decision to tax small depositors in Cyprus These photos from Cyprus this morning confirm that some cash machines are working, and that the situation is calm: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has thrown her support behind the new push to protect smaller Cypriot bank acounts. At a conference in Frankfurt this morning, Lagarde said: We are also obviously extremely supportive of the Cypriot authorities' intentions to introduce more progressive rates in the one-off levy or deposit-share swap within the agreed financial envelope of \u20ac5.8bn. Eurozone insiders have said that Lagarde had wanted to hit the largest depositors in Cyprus hard, with levies of 30% to 40%. Not everyone is impressed with the news, though, with the Daily Telegraph's Jeremy Warner also pointing out that the principle of protecting savers is still trampled: The central bank governor of Cyprus has warned MPs this morning that scrapping the savings levy for those with under \u20ac20k in the bank means it will miss the targets set under the bailout. Panicos Demetriades told a parliamentary committee that: \"We will take less than 5.8 billion euros. As expected, but it looks like confirmation that the revised government draft bill will scraps the tax for bank deposits under \u20ac20,000, without raising the rate for larger deposits. Demetriades also told MPs that the European Central Bank wanted to protect those with under \u20ac100,000 in the bank. And on the question of a bank run... Demetriades estimated that Cypriot banks would see outflows of at least 10% in first few days if the bill was passed, but that the money would flow back when confidence returned. Matina Stevis of Dow Jones/WSJ reports that the committee is struggling to get their heads around the Emergency Liquidity Assistance programme (used to keep Cypriot banks afloat in recent months, and due to run out on Thursday). Martin Baccardax, European business editor at IB Times, points out that Cyprus could get the money to spare savers with under \u20ac20,000 by imposing a haircut on bond holders. Senior and subordinated bondholders were spared any losses in the original Cyprus bailout plan - a controversial move, as they had clearly consciously taken more risk than a Cypriot pensioner. There's only around \u20ac180m of senior debt in the two biggest Cyprus banks (and eurozone policymakers have always resisted impose losses on senior creditors in case it scared them off). But if junior bondholders were also included, Cyprus might be able to cover the shortfall.... While protecting people with less than \u20ac20,000 in Cyprus banks would be a generally welcome move (see previous post), it does not address the fundamental issue that the first \u20ac100,000 of deposits was meant to be protected under Deposit Protection Insurance. Breaking that principle fuelled all the talk about savers in peripheral countries across the eurozone possibly withdrawing their money (although there was no sign of this in Spain or Italy yesterday). As my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty argues powerfully today: You don't need any economics to grasp what Europe and the IMF have just done to the Cypriots. Anybody can imagine how awful it would be to wake up one morning and discover that their savings have just been raided. Over the previous four \"rescues\" of bust eurozone countries, the details have always been swaddled in technicalities: debt restructuring this, fiscal consolidation that. With Cyprus, however, an immediate tax of up to 10% on savings accounts needs little explaining. Officials may euphemise it as a bail-in but everyone else will agree with yesterday's Daily Mail headline: it's a bank robbery. More here: The Cyprus eurozone bailout conditions are bank robbery pure and simple According to Reuters, the Cypriot government has now submitted a new draft bill to parliament that would scrap the controversial levy on bank deposits for amounts below \u20ac20,000 euros. However, it does not appear to include higher rates for larger deposits. Which surely means a shortfall? Here's the details: The draft, seen by Reuters, sets a zero percent levy on deposits of up to 20,000 euros, a 6.75 percent rate for amounts between 20,000 and 100,000 euros and maintains a 9.9 percent tax on all deposits above that level. Jeremy Cook, World First's chief economist, has quickly crunched the numbers and concluded that a higher rate of 12.5% for those with more than \u20ac500,000 in the bank would cover the shortfall: Cyprus's government has confirmed that it is trying to renegotiate its bailout, as speculation is swirling that today's parliamentary vote will be postponed again. Cyprus's Defense Minister Fotis Fotiou told Skai TV that the government was now working on \"Plan B\" - an alternative that might find favour with sufficient MPs. Fotiou said: If this does not pass through Parliament then it is part of responsible politics for us to look at Plan B, which we are examining but can\u2019t discuss publicly. What could this Plan B entail? One rumour is that deposits under \u20ac20,000 would be exempt from the tax - which would pacify concerns that poorer Cypriot are being hit. Another option, of course, is to start the tax at \u20ac100,000, which would mean hiking the rate for larger deposits -- otherwise the maths doesn't add up. Fotiou also compared the terms of the bailout to the invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974, saying \"Of course it\u2019s similar.\" (Greece's Kathimerini has more details). RANsquawk, the market analysts, have flagged up that German Chancellor Merkel's CDU/CSU party is to hold a special party caucus meeting tomorrow on Cyprus. Tensions and anti-German feeling at the Cyprus banks, reports Channel 4's man at the cash machines, Faisal Islam (see 8.20am). Just to be clear, this doesn't look like a bank run -- with the branches closed, people can only take money out as the ATM machines are refilled. Here are the main Cyprus stories in today's Guardian: Cyprus bailout: 'Trust in our banks has evaporated. It can only get worse' This piece from Angelique Chrisafis in Nicosia details how ordinary Cypriots will be affected by the deal as it stands. Anyone with a bank account will be hit by the levy, including all everyday current accounts and non-interest accounts. This is part of the political row facing parliament as it votes today. The super-rich who have made Cyprus their home Simon Bowers looks at the super rich who have based themselves in Cyprus, and who will be hit hard by the savings levy Cyprus bailout: how Nicos walked straight into a German sucker punch The inside story on how president Anastasiadis was outflanked at last weekend's summit meeting, by Ian Traynor and Helena Smith. Cyprus closes banks to stop run amid fury over bailout Our news story of yesterday's events, as Cyprus shuttered its banks until Thursday. France's finance minister has urged Cyprus to drop its plan to tax people with less than \u20ac100,000 in their bank account. Pierre Moscovici said France was in favour of only taxing deposits over \u20ac100,000 (which would not have been protected if a bank went bust), but insisted it was up to the country's government to decide. However, Moscovici also ruled out lending Cyprus any more money directly, as the \u20ac10bn agreed on Saturday morning was the maximum it could be expected to repay. Above 10 billion euros we are entering into a size of debt that is not sustainable. That's the crux of the Cyprus crisis -- the country was ordered to find around \u20ac5.8bn from its savers, or collapse. President Anastasiadis, it appears, was unwilling to hit wealthy savers (including many Russians) with more than a 9.9% losses - which meant a 6.75% levy for everyone else. With hardly any bondholders to hit (one of the quirks of the Cypriot system), the savers were straight in the firing line. Rating agency Fitch has put three Cyprus banks - Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank - on Rating Watch Negative while the bailout drama plays out. In a statement, Fitch said it took the move because of Cyprus's decision to tax savers (by turning a percentage of their deposits into equity). It also suggested that it could downgrade the banks to 'restricted default' if this occurs. Fitch said: The Negative Watches will be resolved after a decision by the Cypriot parliament on the above extraordinary measures, which could come as early as today. The crystallisation of such significant losses on depositors would constitute a restricted default (RD) under Fitch's rating definitions, in which case the IDRs [individual default ratings] would be downgraded to 'RD'. Faisal Islam, Channel 4's economics editor, is in Nicosia, and currenty touring the city's banks (which are due to be closed until Thursday). Here's what he's found: The Crisis Republic, a new blog covering the situation in Southern Europe, has also tweeted a photo of a Bank of Cyprus ATM machine in Greece - which says it can't dispense cash because it's being 'upgraded'.... Other European markets just opened, and shares are falling again FTSE 100: down 28 points at 6428, - 0.45% Spanish IBEX: down 26 points at 8481, -0.35% Italian FTSE MIB: down 46 points at 15877, down 0.3% German DAX: down 0.4% French CAC: down 0.3% Cyprus's stock exchange has declared that trading is suspended until Thursday, in line with the bank holiday announced yesterday. Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades's party only holds 20 seats in the Nicosia parliament, out of 56. His coalition partner, DIKO, has another eight -- but last night it declared that the savings levy was unacceptable as it stood. Most opposition parties have already attacked the plan, including the Greens party (which holds just one seat) this morning: Good morning. The Cyprus bailout remains in the balance today as the government struggles to find support for its controversial bank deposit levy. After Monday's cancellation, MPs are scheduled to vote on the package this afternoon - at 4pm GMT. But it isn't clear that president Nicos Anastasiades has enough support to get the deal passed. The government's official spokesman, Christos Stylianides, has already warned this morning that the levy could be rejected. Speaking on state radio early this morning, Stylianides said: It looks like it won't pass. Should the measure be defeated, then Cyprus would be plunged into an even deeper crisis - as the bailout deal agreed over the weekend would be effectively sunk. As we reported in the blog last night, eurogroup ministers insisted that Cypriot savers should still yield \u20ac5.8bn towards the bailout, but that the Cypriot authorities will introduce \"more progressivity in the one-off levy\". That fuelled hopes last night that deposit holders under \u20ac100,000 could be spared -- but there is no word from Cyprus, yet, on what it will do. According to Reuters, Stylianides could hold talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. Meanwhile, Cyprus's banks remain shut until Thursday, and we're expecting fresh protests outside the presidential palace today. We'll be following all the action through the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
