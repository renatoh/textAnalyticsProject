I have always seen it somewhat differently, as a kind of street version of Cirque du Soleil, suitable for only the skinniest kid with a death wish. Walking towards a cul-de-sac full of low walls, I am disbelieving. \u201cEven someone carrying a lot of extra weight?\u201d \u201cYes, as long as you start with what they are able to do safely.\u201d \u201cEven the strongest man on Earth?\u201d \u201cYes, as long as you allow for his muscle ratio.\u201d We come to some walls. Pearson wants to start with focus and flexibility exercises; warming up has never been more important, especially when you\u2019re not 17. You can land pretty heavily even if you don\u2019t fall off, and this is all concrete, remember. We do a fiendish exercise of rotating one knee while tracing a shape with the other, and rotating one wrist while drawing a box with the other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very much like a box,\u201d he says, affably. I want to make a nitpicking point about the degree to which any shape made with a wrist resembles a box, but he is right; whatever its challenges, I suck at this. Which is a shame because, for some reason, I already love it. You know how sometimes there\u2019s a rail on a low wall, for no reason you could name? The basic starting point is to be able to balance on that rail with one foot. It sounds easy, but it ain\u2019t. I manage 10 seconds on one leg, about six on the other. I\u2019m beyond smug. It took about 20 minutes to achieve this. The basic jump, meanwhile, is a step vault; one hand planted on a low wall as you go over it, the opposite foot lands on the wall; your inside leg tucks underneath yourself, and then you\u2019re over. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, but it\u2019s not so hard that you can\u2019t master it. There\u2019s a lot of swinging round parking signs and scaffolding poles; it\u2019s physical but not technical. You could lose hours just making a routine and trying to speed up: step vault, swing round a pole, step vault, shimmy along a wall for a bit, jump off. It\u2019s the least prissy of any sport I\u2019ve tried; in this complicated urban structure \u2013 it looks like a car park, but it\u2019s not big enough \u2013 we spend ages just toeing round railings, trying to get past pillars and bikes, hanging off scaffolding. One minute I am covered in grease, the next in dirt. We climb laterally along a wall, inches off the ground, holding on to ledges. Anything that is too high to vault, you have to approach with a cat leap. Just run at the wall; as long as there\u2019s something at the top to grab and your first foot places high enough, you\u2019ll make it. \u201cThat\u2019s great, you\u2019re actually bleeding,\u201d Pearson says. It\u2019s true, I have a tiny nick on my wrist. I\u2019ve never been so delighted with myself and yet I don\u2019t know how to get down. What I learned If you\u2019re frightened to do something, try making it harder for yourself by closing your eyes. When you go back and try it the easy way, you\u2019ll be able to do it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
