Slimani, who won the Prix Goncourt for her bestselling novel Lullaby, wrote in Le Monde of how she had left Paris and sequestered herself and her children in their countryside second home since 13 March, telling them that it was \u201ca bit like Sleeping Beauty\u201d. \u201cTonight, I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThrough my bedroom window, I watched dawn break over the hills. The icy grass, the lime trees on the branches of which the first buds appear.\u201d Darrieussecq, meanwhile, wrote in Le Point of how she hid her car with Paris number plates in the garage after arriving at her second home, using the older car that she keeps there to get around because \u201cI feel it\u2019s not good to drive around with a 75 on our behind\u201d. \u201cTwo hinds graze in our fallow garden,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe go to see the sea. It beats, heavy, strong, indifferent. The beach is deserted. I have a vision of a planet without humans.\u201d As rural France turns its back on Parisians fleeing to the countryside, accusing them of spreading coronavirus, and while police checkpoints are set up to prevent city-dwellers from leaving to go to second homes during the Easter holidays, Slimani and Darrieussecq\u2019s pieces received a less than warm reception from readers and fellow writers. \u201cHey poor people,\u201d tweeted the journalist Nicolas Quenel. \u201cIs all well in your 15m apartment for three? To pass the time and take off the pressure of confinement, you can always read the journal of a writer in her family home in the countryside.\u201d In Brain, F\u00e9lix Lema\u00eetre wrote that contemplating the horizon, as Slimani does in her piece, is a \u201cclass privilege\u201d, and that the author\u2019s photos of her country idyll have \u201ca little taste of porn, of obscenity, for all those whose vision for the next few weeks will boil down to an inner courtyard or the building opposite\u201d. The Lullaby author\u2019s experience of confinement in her half-timbered house in the countryside is \u201cin a parallel universe dreamed up by the Grimm brothers\u201d, wrote author Diane Ducret in Marianne. \u201cAt the very least, we are not having the same experience. If for Le\u00efla Slimani, confinement is like a fairytale, for me it is more like a picaresque novel. I am the picaro, of low social rank, without honour or marginal, yearning for freedom and hoping to survive by being resourceful,\u201d wrote Ducret, adding that \u201cMarie-Antoinette playing farmer in Trianon [in Versailles] could not have been further from the fear, the anguish of the people\u201d. \u201cOur intellectual elites sometimes seem to me ungrounded, as if the French revolution did not take place in all areas, and that only a certain social class was authorised to express the taste of the time,\u201d Ducret wrote. \u201cFrom my window, you can\u2019t see the sky. The building opposite is dirty, the empty streets fill me with roaring anxieties. Being stripped by a virus in my 30s, dying alone, perhaps, in a two-room apartment, tempts me only moderately. It would have been less of a seller than the golden hills and camellias of Le\u00efla Slimani, but it would have been more representative of what we are experiencing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
