When Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said that he saw Lukas Podolski as Arsenal's centre-forward, it sounded worrying for Olivier Giroud, the \u00a313m signing from Montpellier, who can really play only as a No9. Giroud talked afterwards of feeling no extra pressure to replace Robin van Persie. The first challenge he faces is to be more than an impact substitute. David Hytner 2 West Ham have a strange dilemma Everyone knows the Sam Allardyce template by now: his sides are organised, fit, difficult to break down and focus heavily on set pieces. Naturally West Ham's winner against Aston Villa came from a free-kick. Yet Allardyce may be troubled that his set-piece takers, Mark Noble and Matthew Taylor, gave two of the weaker performances in open play. Both will need to contribute a lot from dead balls to justify their inclusion. Jacob Steinberg 3 Should Ba switch to the left? Newcastle improved radically when they switched to 4-3-3 against Tottenham. That configuration suits Hatem Ben Arfa, Jonas Gutierrez and Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and worked well last spring, with the only downside being Demba Ba's goal drought. But Ba scored from the left against Spurs. Should Pardew keep him there? Louise Taylor 4 Loftus Road is noisier than normal Anyone who doubts just how fanatical Asian supporters are should take a trip to see Queens Park Rangers play. The arrival of Park Ji-sung to the west London club means each home game will be littered with shrieking South Koreans in the stands, one of whom was sitting a row below the press box during QPR's 5-0 defeat to Swansea on Saturday and screamed with excitement every time the midfielder touched the ball. It went from funny to annoying very, very quickly. Sachin Nakrani 5 Rodgers should take up golf Interesting that Alan Hansen was more critical of Liverpool on Match of the Day on Saturday than he had been during the whole of last season. At one stage he pulled out a coaching manual from the 1970s and talked about \"playing percentages\". Guess that's what happens when your former team-mate gets the sack. Stuart James 6 Advantage in the penalty area Kevin Friend tried to play the advantage, after Dean Whitehead had fouled Garath McCleary, with Reading's Adam Le Fondre appearing certain to score from the loose ball. But Asmir Begovic denied Le Fondre and Friend pointed back to the penalty spot for Whitehead's initial transgression. Le Fondre buried the penalty but should he have been given a second opportunity? Russell Kempson 7 The great entertainers, at last Chelsea could become the entertainers for whom Roman Abramovich has always pined. Eden Hazard served notice of his considerable talent and there was a mouth-watering glimpse of Oscar's capabilities in victory at Wigan. That pair's combination with Juan Mata could be irresistible. Indeed, Roberto Di Matteo's biggest problem could be accommodating these talents into a team structure. But that is a problem for another day. Dominic Fifield 8 English strikers can still bully Ron Vlaar was renowned for his power in the Eredivisie but Aston Villa's summer signing from Feyenoord evidently did not encounter the likes of Carlton Cole very often in Holland. The West Ham striker gave the Dutchman a bruising welcome to the Premier League, bullying him (fairly) on the ground and dominating in the air. Encouragingly, however, Vlaar showed signs of coming to terms with the battle as the match progressed and started to give almost as good as he got. If he continues his adaptation in that vein, he should prove an important recruit, for he clearly has the skill to play out from the back in keeping with the style that Lambert is trying to cultivate. Paul Doyle 9 Is leaving Fulham wise? Martin Jol bristled at Fulham fans gloating at the absent Clint Dempsey during their thrashing of Norwich City. They had a point, though, especially as their new striker Mladen Petric excelled on his debut and scored twice. Would Dempsey's life at Liverpool really be better than at Craven Cottage? There are few more joyous experiences than watching Jol's side at their free-flowing best. Jacob Steinberg 10 Ag\u00fcero has City sweating Manchester City will anxiously await the tests on Sergio Ag\u00fcero after the tackle by Nathaniel Clyne that left him prone with what appeared a knee injury. The initial word from City was that he may require more tests on Monday with no update until Tuesday. He scored 30 goals in his debut season and the sight of him being carried off on a stretcher at the Etihad Stadium was not a good start to City's hopes of retaining the title.
