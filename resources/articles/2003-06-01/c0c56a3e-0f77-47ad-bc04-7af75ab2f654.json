How can a place be untouched by tourism if a company devotes eight pages to it in the brochure? Tilos, however, comes pretty close to that holy grail of holidays. Set roughly midway between Rhodes and Kos, the arid mountains give it an unpromising look as you approach by ferry, but they hide a beautiful island with a few surprises. Usually choosing to travel independently, my husband and I decided to take our chances after seeing an advert for the award-winning Greek specialist, Laskarina. Our group was met at the airport by the cheery Jane, rather deliberately referred to as our guide, not our rep. We were a mixed bunch on the coach, mostly 50-plus, one family with children and a few of us in our 30s. The ferry trip to Tilos took just over an hour and a half, complete with entertainment (crackly Greek commentary on a dodgy picture of a volleyball game). Chaos reigned as we docked, our cases were piled precariously on to a van that Del Boy would have thought twice about and we watched it disappear up the hillside towards our apartment - we hoped. A 10-minute climb and we were standing on our balcony with fantastic views across the sea and down to the harbour village. One slight problem: the beach directly below us was supposed to be a two-minute walk - perhaps this would have been possible with an abseil rope, but we had left it at home. The mention of a \"welcome meeting\" would normally send us scurrying in the opposite direction, but the offer of a free drink was hard to resist in temperatures of 35C. We put our names down for the island tour, but drew the line at the \"famous Laskarina picnic\" - retsina and organised jollity were not for us. The intense heat can dull the brain (especially when combined with a bottle or two of Mythos beer) so, thankfully, getting our bearings around the village was simple. In the centre is the square, round the corner is the bakery, which sells delicious pastries; further along is the church of St Nicholas. Three small general stores provide the basics and more, including plastic swimming shoes -useful on the stony beaches but not for the fashion conscious. There is a surprising variety of eateries situated throughout the small village, many with relaxing views across the sea. Along with the usual fare of Greek salad, dolmades, stifado etc, most have their own daily specials, including goat in lemon sauce, lamb in filo pastry and barbecued fish. A good home-cooked meal with a jug of house wine costs around \u00a312 a head. For about twice that amount, you can choose your own fresh fish at Sofia's, caught by the owner that afternoon and perfectly cooked on the barbecue. Should tomato and feta fatigue set in, head for Joanna's for a superb cocktail or delicious homemade cakes and puddings; they also serve pizzas made by her Italian husband, which I am assured are very tasty. Nico's place became our favourite, and provided the perfect combination of good food, a genial host and a sea view. Our organised trip took us to the site of a cave where the remains of dwarf elephants were discovered fewer than 30 years ago, and where palaeontologists are still uncovering bones. Lying just outside Megalo Chorio, the \"capital\", there is a museum dedicated to the excavation, which is worth a visit. From there, we headed west, inland to the monastery of Aghios Panteleimonas. The 12th-century Byzantine church is shrouded in vegetation, and is perched high in the rocks. It seems incredible that anything could have been built there. That was exactly the reaction when the young monk Ionas proclaimed he had been told in a vision to build a monastery on the site. Impossible, scoffed the locals, there was no water. Spurred on by the vision, Ionas persisted and struck a fresh water spring that still gushes from the mountainside today. We filled our water bottles freely, then were told it has great fertility properties. Although popular with visitors, the monastery still has a great sense of peace. Maybe it was the charm of the place, or the glass of retsina wearing down our reserve, but as we looked out across the valley, we decided to sign up for the picnic. Sixteen of us squeezed into the back of a pick-up, with a row of plastic chairs down the middle. These became known as \"trust seats\" - the occupants had to be sure of a stabilising hand to grab the chair if we went up, down or sideways, which was most of the time. One of the most curious places on the island is the deserted village of Micro Chorio. The arduous farming life drove many away from the community with the promise of a better life in Livadia, the mainland or the US. The tiny houses, no more than 10ft square, are now ruins. Not exactly an estate agent's dream, yet two-and-a-half walls and no roof can fetch \u00a38,000. These piles of rubble are much sought after by families who still have a strong link with the tough life in the hills, but it is not just sentiment that pushes up the price; some feel that the village could be redeveloped. The slightly eerie feel in the deserted village is magnified at dusk, when the island's only nightclub swings into action. You should see those goats groove. A winding trek up the hillside brought us to some magnificent views across the island. Tilos is a popular place with walkers and it was easy to see why, although the stifling heat in July and August would make hill-climbing hard going. Back at the truck, surrounded by the crumbling houses, we enjoyed a cold drink and the party atmosphere started to build. There was time for a swim and snorkel at Eristos beach in the beautifully clear and calm waters before the horn of the truck blew to signal grub was up. During our feast of barbecued chicken and salads, the retsina came out. If you are unfamiliar with the Greek tipple, think Domestos. Retsina is made from pine resin and has a very distinct flavour; it needs to be drunk very chilled (some say to hide the taste); but most seemed to develop a liking for it by the third plastic cupful. Then the much-heralded Greek dancing. If you had told me that I was going to end up shuffling in the dust under a tree with a sweaty taverna owner called Vasilli, I would have thought you had been at the retsina. Unfortunately, I had been, but then so had everyone else and a good time was had by all. If nightclubs, fry-ups and five-star luxury are holiday essentials, give Tilos a wide berth. This is the place for excellent walking, fascinating history, quiet beaches and a genuine Greek welcome. On our last night, we paid a final visit to Nico's and, as we left, he handed us a little parcel, a thank-you for our custom and \"so you think of us\". As I repacked the pot carefully in my hand luggage at the airport, I noticed three others proudly clutching identical parcels. Maybe there is a little touch of tourism on Tilos after all.
