Many tuned their car radios to local stations to find out what was happening. But, sadly for many around Cambridgeshire during that long, cold night, the traffic news they badly needed could not be found. This apparent failing annoyed Sara Nathan of the radio authority. As reported in the Guardian, at a recent Westminster Media Forum she expressed her concern at what she saw as the failure of local commercial radio stations in Cambridgeshire to report on the infamous jam because of a lack of journalists after 7pm. She said it was \"extraordinary that a town the size of Cambridge has no [ILR] journalists based there\". In truth, there are journalists in towns the size of Cambridge, on duty day and night. But they are more likely to be working for local newspapers than for radio. The solution, therefore, seems simple: local newspapers, with their greater resources, could work in tandem with local radio stations to provide an enhanced local news service round the clock. They could, that is, if our media regulators allowed it. Sadly, the communications bill passing through parliament has missed an opportunity: it should have allowed local newspapers and radio to work more closely together on local news supply. As it stands, both must maintain separate newsrooms. But as the above example shows, this requirement can be self-defeating, and it's the public who lose out. One reason for the existing rules is the protection of diversity of voice. This is fair enough in principle, but only as long as the legislation delivers on its promise. When the requirement to offer diversity of voice causes one of the voices to fall silent, it must be time for a rethink. Running a newsroom for a music-based media outlet is expensive. Yet centralisation of radio news has been frowned upon; stations are required to provide their own locally sourced news. The combining of local news operations with other media has also been rejected, even though the stronger local newspapers could usually offer a 24-hour fully manned resource. Take my own company, for example. With four big regional dailies and over 50 weeklies, Archant is the UK's sixth-largest regional press publisher. We live and breathe local news, and it seems strange that we are prevented from sharing these resources with radio newsrooms. The irony is that, in reality, many local and regional TV and radio stations do informally use local newspapers as a source of news. They do it simply by reading the local paper and rewriting the stories for broadcast. (I have done it myself when I worked in TV.) It is time we realised this reality and created an environment where a range of different commercial media operators in any location can join together to supply news and make their voice heard - in snowbound cars on the M11, or anywhere else. \u00b7 Ian Davies is development director of Archant community media, which owns magazines and regional newspapers including the Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express, the Eastern Daily Press and the Essex Recorder"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
