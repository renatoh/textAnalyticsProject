The 21-year-old would surely have won her first global senior medal had her season not been decimated by a fractured navicular bone in February. But she lowered her season\u2019s best by half a second to finish fourth in 22.22sec as the Dutchwoman Dafne Schippers defended her title. In another couple of steps Asher-Smith would have run down Shaunae Miller-Uibo, the Bahamian. And with another couple of months\u2019 training under her belt, who knows what might have transpired. \u201cI was coming down the home straight thinking, \u2018Oh my god, I didn\u2019t know I was in this sort of shape\u2019 but then to see I missed out on bronze by seven hundredths of a second is gutting,\u201d said Asher-Smith. \u201cIn sprinting terms that\u2019s quite a lot but not when you\u2019ve broken your foot. I\u2019m quite frustrated but on reflection I\u2019m pleased to have run a 22.2 on very little training.\u201d Rain started to fall just as the women entered the London Stadium and Asher-Smith got a characteristically flying start, rounding the bend in third. Miller-Uibo, who suffered a Devon Loch style collapse metres from the line in the 400m final, pulled ahead but Asher-Smith began to claw back the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have placings in my mind in the blocks,\u201d said Asher-Smith, who broke her foot in a freak training accident and spent six weeks on crutches. \u201cI know it sounds so silly but I was honestly just so happy to be here. The crowd were getting louder and louder when I was coming down the home straight and I thought \u2018That probably means it\u2019s going quite well, so just keep going.\u2019 It\u2019s my best finish ever in a world final but so close.\u201d Asher-Smith is the fifth British athlete to have finished fourth in these championships, more than any other nation. Callum Hawkins, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, Kyle Langford and Laura Muir are the others to have suffered medal near misses. It means Great Britain languish equal 13th in the medal table, with only Mo Farah\u2019s 10,000m gold to fill the cabinet, but Asher-Smith sounded an optimistic note. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of fourth places but most of those have been by people who are so young who probably have another decade in them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might not have got a medal now but they\u2019re definitely going to be ones to watch in the years to come.\u201d Alongside recovering from injury, Asher-Smith completed her history degree at King\u2019s College London, graduating last month with a 2:1. She paid tribute to her team, especially her coach, John Blackie, afterwards. \u201cThey\u2019ve believed in me every step of the way and I honestly wouldn\u2019t have been able to bang out a 22.22 if it wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d she said. Schippers never looked like relinquishing her title, crossing the line in 22.06. Marie-Josie Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast took silver in a national record 22.08 with Miller-Uibo\u2019s time 22.15. \u201cIt is very special,\u201d said Schippers. \u201cI fought for it and worked very hard this season and chased everything, I had to dip on the finish line because it was difficult to see where Ta Lou was from two lanes away. There were so many Dutch fans in the stadium, all wearing orange. To do it two times in a row is brilliant.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
