Queally's gold medal in the kilometre in the Sydney Olympics in 2000 was a seminal moment in Great Britain's march to the highest level in track cycling, adding an extra emotional twist to his comeback. Queally, Ed Clancy, Andy Tennant and Steven Burke qualified fastest in the morning, then rode flawlessly in the 4,000m final this evening to defeat the Russian quartet, and were matched a few minutes later by Wendy Houvenaghel, Katie Colclough and Laura Trott in the women's event over 3,000m, with the Lithuanians a distant second. Completing a satisfying beginning in Poland on the long road to London, Victoria Pendleton and Jessica Varnish were narrowly beaten by the French duo of Clara Sanchez and Sandie Claire in the team sprint while Sir Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny and Matt Crampton improved on their time of the morning in the men's event to take bronze from the Polish trio. Afterwards Queally was \"ecstatic\" but also realistic about his chances of making the quartet for next year's world championships and London, his ultimate goal. \"I've got a long way to go,\" he said. \"I'm up against the likes of Bradley Wiggins and Geraint Thomas, who are the best guys at this in the world. The aim is London and as a pathway to that this can't be bettered, but there will be eight or nine riders battling for a place there. It's a fantastic start.\" Clancy was the only member of the Beijing gold medal-winning British quartet racing tonight and said he and his team- mates had improved on their morning's qualifier. \"The first two kilometres we rode to our schedule, then we based our race on the Russians and upped our game. I wasn't optimistic after this morning, I thought they might give us trouble.\" All round the Great Britain camp, the feeling is there is much more to come, and not just in the next two days. Pendleton pointed out that she and Varnish were within a cat's whisker of their best time together, \"which isn't bad for November\", while the women's team pursuit trio were racing together for the first time. Colclough and Trott are relative novices at international level while Lizzie Armitstead, Rebecca Romero and the new discovery Claire Galloway are waiting in the wings. The disappointment, if there was one, came in the qualifying round of the men's team sprint, when Hoy pointed to a poor changeover which he said could have cost the trio a place in the final. Their bronze-medal winning time, on a par with the gold-medal winners Germany, certainly showed they were fast enough, even if they were \"ring-rusty\" as the performance director, Dave Brailsford, put it. Tomorrow Pendleton will miss the women's match sprint to focus on Sunday's keirin, with Varnish stepping into her place. Hoy and Kenny contest the men's match sprint while the omnium riders compete in the first half of their six-event programme. The world champion, Clancy, has played down his chances due to a change in the format to longer events, while Britain's junior women's world champion Laura Trott is stepping up to senior level at just 18. The omnium riders contest a flying lap time\u2011trial, a points race and the new event in the discipline, the devil-take-the-hindmost or elimination race in which the last rider over the line on each lap is eliminated. This is the event's debut at international level and there is speculation about how it will be managed, due to the need to get the eliminated rider out of the field before he can affect the outcome of the race. It could turn into a crowd-pleaser or a judge's nightmare."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
