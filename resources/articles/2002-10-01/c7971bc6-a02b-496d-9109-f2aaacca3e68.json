I think it goes against what formula one stands for which is a set of regulations under which the people with the cleverest minds and the best budgets do the best jobs.\" Niki Lauda, Jaguar team principal, three-times world champion \"Firstly we've got to decide whether or not we change the whole principal of the sport which has been a showcase for technical excellence for more than 50 years. If you decide this, then you can do anything. These suggestions from the FIA are a typical example of things getting out of hand. We should dramatically restrict all the electronic control systems to put the control of the cars back more in the drivers' hands.\" Flavio Briatore, team principal, Renault F1 \"The first thing we need to do is to reorganise qualifying so it's a better show. Doing nothing is clearly not an option. We have a ridiculous situation at the moment whereby most of the cars don't go out on to the circuit for the first half hour of qualifying. And we have to make sure that the practice sessions on Friday count for qualifying. At the moment the Friday sessions mean nothing. What sort of show is that for the paying public?\" Damon Hill, 1996 world champion \"For those of us who love the sport, it hurts. Yet sometimes one feels deeply ashamed to be involved with it. It's embarrassing how far out of touch it's become. You do have a sense of 'what a waste', when you watch it. It's lost its way. One thing cannot put it right, but a good starting point would be for those who run the sport to sit down on a Sunday afternoon and decide whether it's good entertainment. The message that everybody in formula one gives is that they don't give a toss for anyone outside the sport. You can fiddle with the regulations until the cows come home, but until there is a fundamental attitude change it shows all the signs of going the way of the Miss World contest.\" Gerhard Berger, BMW Motorsports director \"This whole issue of making the correct decisions over precisely how to improve formula one is so sensitive and important that I don't believe there should be any knee-jerk reactions. Everything should be put on the table and considered carefully so that everybody involved understands the complexity of what is at stake. But we must start considering it in detail because the show is too boring.\" Ron Dennis, chairman, McLaren \"The worry is that you make major changes which have not been thought through and they don't have the hoped-for results. The only way of making the racing better for teams likes ourselves and Williams is to get on and beat Ferrari, something which we haven't been doing recently.\" Maurice Hamilton, broadcaster, BBC Radio 5 Live \"I would ban in-race refuelling. It adds nothing to the racing and the effect of banning it would be the same across the board. I think this would also put a premium on the driver conserving his car's handling over the entire race distance. The weight handicap is not appropriate to formula one. It is too artificial and where does it stop? Putting the fastest qualifier at the back of the starting grid?\" Ian Phillips, director of business development, Jordan \"Improving the show is not the point. Cutting costs is the most immediate priority. If we don't cut costs there won't be any show to argue about. We have to address the things which are simplest to implement. We should run the engines further, impose a testing ban and have common electronics. I know the major engine makers may complain about this, but how many of the paying spectators understand the subtleties of which electronic box is being used on the cars?\" Tony Brooks, former Ferrari driver, runner-up in 1959 world championship \"I think it's back to the same old basics. You've got to get rid of the downforce and artificial driver aids. I think Bernie Ecclestone has put it very succinctly, but of course if you get rid of these accessories you have to be sure that everybody is getting rid of them. What you do to reduce the costs, of course, is another story. Reducing the number of engines would seem to be sensible. But there has never, ever been a cheap formula one and that's really it.\" Mark Blundell, formula one driver 1991-95 \"Some of the things suggested have some credibility. The weight handicap idea is one, but there is a safety issue with that. If you crash at 150mph with the amount Ferrari would be carrying this year, the extra weight would make it dangerous. I'm all for a reduction in the technology because it takes away some of the skills the drivers use. Something has to be done be cause the public are not getting value for money at the moment. It has never been as bad as this in the past.\" David Richards, team principal BAR-Honda \"We need to think very carefully about what we do. A sport steeped in heritage with great success to date can't have radical changes overnight without them being thought about very carefully. It's all about spicing it up for the audience.\" John Watson, formula one driver 1973-85 \"I do have some sympathy for the teams that have worked hard to be successful. But this level of domination is not simply Ferrari, it is also specifically Michael Schumacher. And you can't do much about that apart from banning him which isn't really fair! There are things that can be done, although it just drives teams to find ways around new rules through further development. The two areas I would look at are aerodynamics and limiting testing. But some of the FIA proposals are frivolous. Stephen Hendry, snooker player and grand prix fan \"Ferrari may be currently dominating formula one but to try and introduce a handicap into any sport is crazy. A few years ago no one could see anyone beating Williams, then along came McLaren. The two of them shared the titles around for a few years until Ferrari got their act together. But when you've got the best driver in the world driving the best car you are always likely to have this scenario and, to be honest, if you put Michael Schmacher in any other car then there's a chance he'd still end up world champion. It's up to the others to catch up.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
