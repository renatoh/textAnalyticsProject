The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, is understood not to have included the incident in his report of Wednesday's Champions League match, meaning Uefa is unlikely to take further action against the Arsenal goalkeeper. Szczesny will serve a one-match ban in the second leg of the last-16 tie in Bavaria for the red card that he received for clattering into Arjen Robben inside the area. He faced the prospect of an extra game if Uefa had looked into the gesture which he made on the touchline. Goals from Toni Kroos and Thomas M\u00fcller left Arsenal with the difficult task of attempting to overturn a 2-0 deficit when they travel to the Allianz Arena on 11 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
