How you react to that is telling", "bodyText": "If I had to pick my favourite irrational fear \u2013 behind falling into open manholes, snakes coming out of the toilet and the unshakeable belief that my friends\u2019 newborn baby secretly hates me and is going to beat me up as soon as he learns how fists work \u2013 it would probably be filling in forms. No matter how long I spend poring over them, painstakingly writing out everything in a black fountain pen and BLOCK CAPITALS, I\u2019m positive I\u2019ve made a mistake. What if, when confronted with one of those \u201cdo you consent to this company contacting you\u201d questions, I wrongly ticked the box that allows them to message me via swarms of angry bees? What if, instead of requesting an aisle seat, I\u2019ve mistakenly given my consent to be fired out of the plane via ejector seat if they\u2019ve overbooked the flight? It\u2019s a fear I\u2019ll never get over, especially not after this week, when I learned of the horrifying story of David Smith, a 60-year-old punter from Loughborough, who managed to lose \u00a3189,000 on an accumulator by filling out a form wrongly. Move over Best Friends\u2019 Thug Baby \u2013 this scenario has replaced all of my nightmares now. Two weeks ago, Smith picked six outside winners on an accumulator that added up to \u00a3212,000, a truly baffling amount of money. When he went to collect his winnings, however (presumably with a wheelbarrow, to take it back to a Scrooge McDuck-style vault), he realised that instead of writing \u201cBialco\u201d, a winner in the 2.15 at Perth, he had put down the annoyingly similarly named Bailarico, third placed in the 3.40 at Goodwood. Personally I\u2019d argue this is proof that horse-owners need to come up with more original names (Philip Seymour Hoofman, Pony Cascarino, Chevalerie Singleton, Horson Welles, anyone?). According to Smith, he had alerted the staff at his local Betfred to his mistake after the 2.15 but before the 3.40 race, and they had assured him that his bet would count. When he checked his winnings, however, the sixth bet was void, meaning that he had lost nearly \u00a3200,000, earning him the paltry sum of just \u00a323,000 \u2013 a figure that at least could buy him 3,878 of the world\u2019s smallest violins. If you think about it, the story follows a classic \u201cunderdog takes on the big bad guy\u201d narrative, where a hopeful punter literally beats the odds to pull off an incredible victory \u2013 but then, after overcoming the slings and arrows of misfortune, he\u2019s defeated by something as stupid as an administrative error. It\u2019s like if Rocky ended with Stallone beating Apollo Creed in a stunning victory, but just as he\u2019s about to lift the championship belt he trips over his own shoelace and knocks himself out on the corner cam. But perhaps more interesting than the story itself is how people react to it \u2013 and specifically, who they think is in the wrong. On the one hand, you can empathise with the bookie (as much as it\u2019s possible to empathise with a powerful corporation that profits from the addiction and suffering of others) \u2013 rules are rules, and Smith did technically place his bet on the wrong horse. On the other hand, it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not what Smith intended, and surely the system has to be flexible enough to incorporate human error. Smith also claims that none of this would have happened if the regular manager, whom he knows well, had been at the shop when Smith noticed the error, as he would have corrected the bet immediately. But then is that really how this system should work? Unbending, unforgiving rules, unless you happen to know people in high places? Both positions, when taken to extremes, are ludicrous \u2013 either strictly defined rules control every aspect of our lives and deviation from them means ruin (ie Nineteen Eighty-Four), or rules are meaningless, and one\u2019s stock in life is defined solely by whom one knows (ie Mad Max, the feudal system, or the lives of the shortlisted candidates in the Conservative leadership campaign). The answer is probably a combination of the two, along with a reliance on how things are \u201cusually\u201d done. But we\u2019re entering a scary new world, where those traditions are breaking down, and adherence to rules by our political elites \u2013 both legal and unspoken \u2013 seems to be optional. We must, it seems, pick sides. Underneath this story about a horse named after a Portuguese folk dance, there\u2019s a binary choice to be made \u2013 do we favour the bookmaker, and embrace the tyranny of law, or do we favour Smith, and embrace the anarchy of none? \u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
