A prisoner advocacy group has said that a prison-appointed psychologist at Bandyup women\u2019s prison warned that a long-term female prisoner would find it traumatic to sleep on bunk beds in a shared cell because she had been sexually assaulted on bunk beds as a child. But Marc Newhouse, a spokesman for Bandyup Action Group and Death in Custody Watch, said prison officers ruled against the psychologist\u2019s recommendations. \u201cThey are trying to deal the overcrowding crisis by double-bunking against psychological advice about how it could re-traumatise the person,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be an incident if that sort of practice continues. It\u2019s only a matter of time until we have a death in custody at Bandyup.\u201d Newhouse has previously described conditions in the prison as \u201cakin to torture\u201d. In a statement, the WA Department of Corrective Services said it considered advice from its psychologists when determining prisoner placement but would not say if that advice was ever overruled. \u201cThe department\u2019s objective is to maximise each woman\u2019s potential to safely and productively reintegrate them with their families and communities following release,\u201d it said. \u201cSharing a cell can assist prisoners\u2019 wellbeing by helping them with socialisation, buddying and orientation into the prison environment. \u201cAnecdotal evidence indicates that many women appreciate the companionship the dual-occupancy cell arrangement provides.\u201d The majority of Bandyup\u2019s cells are now double occupancy. According to figures provided by the department, the prison had a population of 320 on Tuesday and a total capacity of \u201cmore than 350 beds\u201d. It says the prison is not overcrowded. On 18 March, there were 329 prisoners in Bandyup and the department gave the total capacity at 343 beds. When the inspector of custodial services conducted an official visit (pdf) 12 months ago, its operational capacity \u2013 a term that excludes special-purpose beds and which has recently been replaced by the more inclusive measure of total capacity \u2013 was 259, for a population of 293. Prisoners were sleeping on mattresses on the floor. The department has been steadily installing bunk beds into units at Bandyup and said there were no longer any inmates sleeping on the floor. But a survey of some of the retrofitted cells in unit four, conducted by an inmate for the Bandyup Action Group, said the cramped beds meant anyone who was more than about 160cm tall could not comfortably sit up in bed. \u201cIn some units, the table has been removed so there is nowhere to sit except the bed,\u201d a Bandyup Action Group spokeswoman, Kelly Somers, said. Somers said the position of the retrofitted top bunks, which prisoners helped to install as part of a prisoner work program, meant the pillow of the top bunk was about 10cm from a wall-mounted light The department denied the beds were cramped and said there was \u201csufficient space on the top bunk for an average-size female to sit up\u201d, and that lower bunks had \u201cadequate sitting space for prisoners of all sizes\u201d. The department said the bunk beds were not intended to be a permanent measure, but merely to provide a \u201ccomfortable sleeping arrangement\u201d until the $20m redevelopment of an empty unit at Hakea, a men\u2019s remand facility south of Perth, into a 252-bed women\u2019s prison is completed. That plan has been criticised by the opposition, the West Australian Prisoner Officers\u2019 Union and the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee as costly and inappropriate. All three critics said women should instead be housed at the privately run Wandoo young men\u2019s prison, which is under capacity. The Bandyup Action group has called for the immediate release of all women in prison for fine defaulting and other \u201ctrivial\u201d offences in an attempt to reduce overcrowding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
