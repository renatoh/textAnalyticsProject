And not just inside theatre buildings. The country was gripped by live, unrepeatable, perishable performances. Political protest took the form of drama when, in Manchester, Jai Redman created a miniature version of the internment camp at Guantanamo Bay: flag-raising at 7.30am, escorted visits to the Portaloo, evening prayers at 9pm. Public debate - most strikingly in the popular Intelligence 2 series at the Royal Geographical Society - took to the stage. Tony Benn's lecture tours - in which the politician plays himself with the help of a Thermos and pipe - have proved such a crowd puller that they have no terminal date. Flash mobs - convened by text-messaging - were the year's addition to street theatre: 250 people startled a Tottenham Court Road sofa shop when they arrived, all praising the furniture, and all forbidden to use the letter 'o'. More than a 100 mobbers turned up at the London Eye, each bearing, as instructed, a banana and an umbrella. Other arts became theatricalised: Artangel reanimated the deserted village of Imber, in an ambitious site-specific performance that blended installation art and concert. Bill Viola's videos were rightly compared to Beckett's plays. And the whole of London became a stage for the spectacle of David Blaine. Meanwhile, inside theatre buildings, acting and writing talent sprouted luxuriantly. New artistic directors performed at full tilt. The most important single event was Nicholas Hytner's arrival as artistic director of the National. Overnight, London theatre was turned on its axis. Hytner's cheap seats policy - for six months two-thirds of the seats in the Olivier cost \u00a310 - meant that people could actually afford to go to the building that they were subsidising: families could go together, individuals could take their chances on unknown quantities, and the programming was a breakthrough. Two-and-a-half years ago, when I first saw Jerry Springer - The Opera at Battersea Arts Club, it was unimaginable that the beautifully articulated, soaringly sung 'Dip me in chocolate and throw me to the lesbians' would ever be heard at the National. Now that it's in the West End, it's easy to forget how startling was this satire of low confessions and high culture, or how unexpected it was that a fringe theatre should be one of the main veins feeding the National. But then two years ago it was hard to think of the National using a Shakespeare production to launch a political argument, as it did when, while British soldiers went into Iraq, Hytner staged a Henry V showing a Prince and his spin-doctors whipping up support for an unpopular war. Most importantly, the National is now really diverse: you can get a sense of the range of British theatre by going between its three auditoria. And it brimmed over with outstanding productions of outstanding new plays: Michael Frayn's Democracy, Kwame Kwei-Armah's Elmina's Kitchen, Owen McCafferty's Scenes from the Big Picture and Martin McDonagh's The Pillowman. McDonagh also made theatrical history in 2003 when his joshing, gory play about terrorism, The Lieutenant of Inishmore, opened in terrorist-riven Istanbul. Political and social engagement marked this least effete of theatrical years, in which a fresh seam of documentary drama was mined. At the Theatre Royal, York, David Hare and Max Stafford-Clark's The Permanent Way proved to be a vital piece of reportage, based entirely on first-hand accounts, dramatising the dismal state of the railways 10 years after privatisation. The Tricycle impeccably reconstructed the Hutton Inquiry from transcripts. And in Dalston, the tiny Arcola produced Come Out Eli, a re-creation of the 2002 Hackney siege which, by taping the memories of local residents and playing them to the actors on-stage through earphones, reproduced not only the words but the precise baroque inflections of everyday speech: it was like nothing heard on the stage before. Alongside these British documentaries ran a stream of Continental invention: The Bristol Old Vic, re-invigorated by David Farr and Simon Reade, got off to a flying start with Samuel West's fine production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The Royal Court continued to bring a seldom-seen Eastern Europe close, with Terrorism and Playing the Victim. At the Young Vic, Rufus Norris's dashing production of Perib\u00e1\u00f1ez made Lope de Vega look like Dali's first cousin. And under Michael Grandage's direction, the Donmar staged an incandescent Caligula as well as Patrick Marber's incisive version of Miss Julie, with a searing Kelly Reilly. There were happy rediscoveries: of plays from the First World War at the Pleasance; of John Fletcher's 1611 feminist sequel to The Taming of the Shrew, rousingly directed by Gregory Doran at Stratford; of John Osborne's The Hotel in Amsterdam, with Tom Hollander as a slouching Jaggerish anti-hero; of the exuberant A Chorus Line at Sheffield. There were inspiring debuts: the actor Tom Hardy at Hampstead; the snapping dialogue of 22-year-old Lucy Prebble at the Royal Court. And there was an invigorating mixture of movement theatre and high-tech wizardry. Polly Teale plaited together the stories of Jane Eyre, the first Mrs Rochester and the author Jean Rhys to create the marvellous After Mrs Rochester. Her play featured high velocity acting with no special effects, and went on from the Lyric Hammersmith to become one of the few bright lights in a rotten West End. Jonathan Kent's Setagaya Public Theatre's production of Hamlet engineered visual magnificence - Paul Brown's sumptous design trapping the action in a succession of boxes - while the wonderful Shinobu Nakamura, a female impersonator, made an Ophelia who was everybody's glove-puppet. And in a dazzling conflation of the cutting-edge and the traditional, Simon McBurney brought together mime and video in The Elephant Vanishes, creating his pachyderm with the help of agile actors and a floating film image of a wise old animal eye. Dramas popped up everywhere. At the Edinburgh Festival, Grid Iron - magicians of site-specific performance - escorted an audience around a neglected Georgian house, unravelling the history of a romance, and unwrapping surprises at each turn: a dust-cover was whisked off a bed to reveal a tiny lawn complete with ornamental pool. Five minutes' walk away, the Dublin-based company Semper Fi created a perfect noir thriller. In a public convenience. This was a morphing, shape-changing, place-shifting year for theatre.
