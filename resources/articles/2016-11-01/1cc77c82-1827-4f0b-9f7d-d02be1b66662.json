A family in Nashville, Tennessee, has filed a $30m lawsuit against Amazon, arguing that the online retailer should be held liable for the ill-fated Christmas present that burned their house down. Megan Fox purchased what she thought was a FITBURO\u00ae F1 with an \u201coriginal Samsung advanced battery\u201d from a company called \u201cW-Deals\u201d through Amazon\u2019s website on 3 November 2015, according to the complaint. The hoverboard remained in a closet until Christmas, when it was given to her 14-year-old son. On 9 January 2016, the toy\u2019s battery apparently exploded \u2013 a common occurrence that led to the recall of more than 500,000 hoverboards by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in July. Two of the family\u2019s children were at home at the time of the fire and had to escape by breaking windows and jumping from the second floor. The million-dollar house and most of the family\u2019s belongings went up in flames. Amazon is not generally liable for the behavior of third-party merchants who use its platform to sell their products. But according to the lawsuit, \u201cW-Deals\u201d was a \u201csham entity\u201d selling counterfeit products from China. The Fox family\u2019s attorney told the Tennessean that they \u201cspent months\u201d trying to track down the actual manufacturer of the faulty hoverboard but came up empty. If no manufacturer can be found, Tennessee product liability law allows a plaintiff to go after the \u201cseller\u201d instead \u2013 in this case, the $380bn online retail behemoth. The suit also alleges that Amazon was negligent in failing to warn customers about safety problems with hoverboards, which it claims should have been known to the company prior to 9 January 2016. Amazon began pulling some hoverboards from the site in mid-December 2015 over safety concerns. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
