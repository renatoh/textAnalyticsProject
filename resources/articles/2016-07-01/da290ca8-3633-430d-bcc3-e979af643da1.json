Before Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final meeting with the Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Murray underlined the extent to which more than a decade of Wimbledon appearances had left him entirely inured to external pressure. \u201cWhat the bookies say is completely irrelevant. Since I\u2019ve been playing Wimbledon the last 10 years, I\u2019d probably say seven or eight of those years, the expectation has been extremely high and the pressure\u2019s been unbelievably high,\u201d said Murray, who swatted Nick Kyrgios aside with such ease in the last round that he felt compelled to apologise to the fast imploding Australian enigma at the net afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the same this year regardless of who\u2019s in the draw or not and it will be the same until I\u2019m done playing tennis. The expectation is extremely high at this event regardless. It doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. Tsonga is unlikely to yield as easily as Kyrgios but Murray has prevailed in 12 of their 14 meetings, including two here at Wimbledon, and will start as the overwhelming favourite. With each passing year, Murray\u2019s towering achievement in overcoming both Djokovic and 77 years of history in 2013 becomes more rather than less impressive. And having done so, it\u2019s hard not to believe him when he says nothing can faze him now. \u201cI deal with my own expectation. I expect to play my best tennis at these events and put a large amount of pressure on myself to do so, which I don\u2019t think people always appreciate. Some people think that the expectation mainly comes from the press but I don\u2019t read what the press say. I\u2019m also not that interested what the press say,\u201d he said. It is a standby trope of most top sportspeople to say that they put more pressure on themselves than the media or public ever could but coming from Murray\u2019s lips it is eminently believable, particularly when he points out that his avoidance of the media during Wimbledon fortnight extends to watching other matches with the sound off. \u201cIt\u2019s what my team [feels] and how I feel and I\u2019m putting a lot of expectation on myself at this event like I do at all of the grand slams and I play my most consistent tennis at all of the slams doing that. \u201cI\u2019ve had more ups and down in my career outside of the slams but at them, when I\u2019ve put the most expectation and pressure on myself, I\u2019ve played better.\u201d The all-action Tsonga reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2011, a run which included a thrilling five-set victory over Roger Federer, and in 2012 but has not progressed beyond the fourth round since until now. In that 2012 semi-final, Murray overcame Tsonga fairly smoothly in four sets. Though he went on to lose to Federer in a tear-stained, rain-affected final, it was the moment at which something shifted and it became clear that winning Wimbledon was a feat he was likely to achieve rather than one destined to remain frustratingly beyond his grasp. The semi-final also had an odd denouement when both players had to wait for a Hawk-Eye decision on a ball that was erroneously called out, though Murray also remembers it for an eye-watering moment when his French opponent was hit where it hurts at close quarters. Tsonga, two years older than Murray and a firm crowd favourite at SW19 when he is not playing the home hope, has endured plenty of painful moments against Murray down the years. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why. We\u2019ve played a lot of close matches as well but I\u2019ve managed to come through a lot of them. Jo is one of the toughest players to play on the grass but on the other surfaces I\u2019ve managed to play some good matches against him,\u201d said Murray. \u201cApart from the one tough loss against him which was the first round of the Australian Open [in 2008]. At the time, the press were slamming me for losing that one and a couple of weeks later he was in the final. So he\u2019s gone on to become a top player.\u201d Asked what Murray had that he did not, Tsonga picked out his backhand as more \u201csolid\u201d and praised his movement. But, more than that, he said it was Murray\u2019s \u201cdefensive flair\u201d \u2013 a natural ability to be in the right place at the right time \u2013 that made him so hard to beat. If there is one area in which the vanquished Kyrgios could learn from a man he clearly looks up to it is in Murray\u2019s evident determination to wring every last drop from his talent. Now eyeing a possible final against Federer and revenge for 2012, he may not have a better chance to win a second Wimbledon title. But before a possible semi-final against Tomas Berdych or Lucas Pouille, he must overcome a familiar foe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
