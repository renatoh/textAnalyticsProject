I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just another false alarm ...\u201d The Halcyon may be the safest place to be in the city during an air raid \u2013 but Monday night is not the safest place to be in the TV schedules. You really need to up the ante. And after last week\u2019s polished episode and the establishment of some interesting relationships, it all went off the rails tonight. I\u2019m gutted, actually, after the excitement of the previous two weeks. This really was a bit dull. Are they setting themselves an unwinnable challenge, trying to evoke the tension of war in the glamorous, rarefied surroundings of one of London\u2019s top hotels, a place where people have gone to escape the outside world? Maybe. Here we had too many characters, too much of little consequence going on and not enough personal high stakes. Why should we care about his gun-toting Excellency? Do we believe the Maverick American Journalist would just turn up at Freddie\u2019s base and start asking questions about Dunkirk? Are we bothered if Billy signs up with the Royal Engineers? I couldn\u2019t have cared less if Billy shot His Excellency or not. And that is a bad sign. Ill-defined plane-related war drama, gun theft, stolen cufflinks ... I so wanted to be on the edge of my seat, but I felt like I was watching in another room. I knew instantly that Billy had taken the gun for pretty much no reason. And then, of course, a locked door and suddenly His Excellency turned out to be far more interesting than anyone wanted him to be ... don\u2019t be a creep, Excellency! No wonder you got thrown out of the Dorchester and the Savoy. Something about the saga of the cufflinks and Mr Klein (\u201cthe Or-strian\u201d) didn\u2019t quite work either, although it was a good device for setting Garland Sr against Garland Jr. In real life, I\u2019m sure something like this could happen (ie a member of hotel staff could take a sympathetic interest in Mr Klein\u2019s threatened Jewish family), but I don\u2019t think they would do it publicly and consult other people about it. The dynamic of the daughter playing her father off Her Ladyship was excellent but took a long time to emerge. \u201cYou\u2019re forbidding me ... as what? My parent? Or my superior?\u201d \u201cAs your manager I\u2019m not happy at all. But as your father, I\u2019m a little impressed.\u201d More of this, please. Just cut to the chase. It was almost all worth it, though, for the sacking of the Chef Possessing Historically Accurate Bigotry (played with a great sense of fun by the excellent Kevin Eldon) and I look forward to the Or-strian\u2019s elevation not only to sous-chef but to a more pivotal role in the plot. I hope it isn\u2019t the last we see of the bigoted chef, too. In the short term, I\u2019m now worried about The Halcyon. This glossy gift of a series is suffering from its Monday night scheduling slot. Saturday or Sunday would have given it more of a lift. It\u2019s not picking up the core Middle England audience it needs to survive, and it\u2019s not doing enough to sustain people\u2019s attention. Downton had its unmissable Dame Maggie moments, several emerging alliances and \u2013 the lifesaver \u2013 the headline-grabbling death of Mr Pamuk at this exact stage in its development: series one, episode three. But we must not despair. As Mr O\u2019Hara says: \u201cThey might get scared, but they won\u2019t let fear win the day. That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m learning about the Brits ... they know how to make the best of a bad situation.\u201d Let\u2019s hope this is true for this series. I\u2019m hanging on in there. Diamante brooch for best supporting costume A stunning russet number (complete with actual diamante brooch) from Her Ladyship. Betsy\u2019s spotty blouse with red velvet ribbon was darling. I do feel sorry for Kara Tointon in this series; she\u2019s in there to liven things up and they don\u2019t give her anything to do apart from click her fingers and sashay a bit. Still, she does it beautifully. The brooch this week, though, goes to Betsy\u2019s print number in one of the final scenes. Inevitable Downton Abbey flashback moment \u201cAn example of the Barbizon school ...\u201d Lady Hamilton\u2019s art-loving fancyman Mr D\u2019Aberville was reminiscent of Richard E Grant\u2019s character in Downton, bonding with the lady of the house over his etchings and telling sauerkraut jokes. More of this kind of humour might lift things a bit. Glad Mr D\u2019Aberville is sticking around. Show-stopping lines \u201cTrading it all in to become a civil servant ... well, at least you dress the part.\u201d Lady Hamilton is ever-supportive to her sons. \u201cNow the good lady adds insult to injury ...\u201d Yes. This is just what Her Ladyship does. \u201cMost of the kitchen staff act strange. Hardly a basis for guilt.\u201d Something about this line amused me. I would like to know more about the strange behaviour of the kitchen staff. \u201cYou check the temperature out there. People are increasingly suspicious about foreigners.\u201d No comparison to the present day or anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
