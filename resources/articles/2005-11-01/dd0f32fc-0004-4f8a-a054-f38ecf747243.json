P&amp;O's likely exit from the London Stock Exchange comes, ironically, just a week before Goldenport becomes the first shipowner in two decades to list on the main British market. Dubai Ports World has been in talks with P&amp;O since October 30, when the UK ports and ferry company said it had received an approach from an unnamed suitor. Since then it has been going through the P&amp;O books and struggling to put a firm valuation on the pension liabilities before making a formal offer. But Dubai Ports World, which declined to comment yesterday, is understood to be ready to submit an offer of between 420p and 440p per P&amp;O share - the shares closed at 437.5p on Friday. There is still widespread speculation that Denmark's Moeller-Maersk, Singapore government investment agency, Temasek Holdings, and Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa could mount counterbids. P&amp;O, the world's fourth-largest ports group, has long been seen as a takeover target and its stock hit a four-year high in May on speculation Temasek was building a stake. Over the last 20 years P&amp;O has been built into a diversified group encompassing cruise and bulk vessels, port operations and property by Margaret Thatcher's favourite industrialist, Lord Sterling, who later sold off many businesses before bowing out last spring. Meanwhile Goldenport, formed and owned by the Dragnis family of Greece, is planning to raise \u00a380m to reduce its debt and expand its fleet. The Dragnis family is the first Greek shipowner to use London rather than New York to raise equity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
