If not, ensure that once getting in the taxi the driver turns on his tariff. If he doesn't or refuses, get out of the cab - you would be perfectly within your rights to note his number (that too should be displayed) and call the police. Do not under any circumstances try settling the fare with the driver before being taken to your destination - it is against the law and also a certainty that you will be ripped off. NB: try the fish restaurants in the resort immediately before Nidri - can't remember what it's called now, but certainly they are much better than the ones in Nidri.
