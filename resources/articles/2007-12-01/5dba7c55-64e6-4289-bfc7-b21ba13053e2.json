As downloads, YouTube, MySpace, USB sticks, messageboards and the like continued to alter our listening habits, we increasingly sought comfort in old, familiar sounds. Band reunions reached a craggy peak, with the reformation of rock totems Led Zeppelin at the apex (the Verve, the Police, the Spice Girls, Genesis, Boyzone, Wu Tang Clan, Duran Duran and, um, Shed Seven also served). Another old band proved ubiquitous, featuring prominently in film (Control), in slavish musical tribute (Editors) and in song (The Wombats' 'Let's Dance To Joy Division'). With some irony, the surviving members of Joy Division - New Order - acrimoniously shed iconic bassist Peter Hook. We lost Lee Hazlewood, Alice Coltrane and Tony Wilson. We gained new blood too, though. Klaxons won the Mercury Prize with their fluorescent debut, but Bat for Lashes probably gained most from the shortlist exposure. And the biggest talent-show star yet, Leona Lewis, eclipsed Arctic Monkeys' record for the fastest-selling UK debut album. Shame it was so syrupy. The rift between recorded and live music widened this year, one depreciating while the other fattened. Major artists took to releasing records through coffee shops (Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell) and signed recording contracts with gig promoters (Madonna and Live Nation) rather than record labels, who continued to merge and purge. Artists such as Prince and Radiohead actually gave albums away - the former with a Sunday newspaper and the latter online, under an honesty-box system that saw swathes of people paying nothing for one of the year's finest comebacks. No one gave a fig for the new Spice Girls single but tickets for their tour sold briskly. In the old days, singles were loss leaders for albums; now, it seems, recorded music is a loss leader for lucrative tours. For all the terrific music that rang out, 2007 will be remembered as the year that two fine musicians, Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty, became national obsessions of the cameraphone age. Here's hoping they're still around next year.
