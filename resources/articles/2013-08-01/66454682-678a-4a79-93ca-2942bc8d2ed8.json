It might simply be that you bowl a couple of cracking balls or that a batsman plays a bad shot or two. You might have found a surprise bit of bounce or snagged an lbw. Sometimes it can happen without you really noticing. But if you have got a batsman out three or four times in the same series then you are in business \u2013 all of a sudden you have got yourself a bit of a bunny. By this stage of the summer the England and Australia teams have become pretty familiar with each other, there has been time for these little intricacies between the sides to develop and the bowlers have had a chance to get the wood on a few batsmen. It is not something that happens straight away. If you have knocked over a batsman once \u2013 fine, it happens. Twice, OK. But more than that in the space of a few Tests then there is definitely something to work with. There are a few bowler-batsmen combinations in this series that look promising from the bowler's point of view: Ryan Harris has done for Jonathan Trott four times, Peter Siddle had Matt Prior on four occasions (and nine times in total), Stuart Broad has dismissed Michael Clarke five times in his past seven innings, likewise Graeme Swann had Chris Rogers in five of the past six. The more you get a batsman out the more it becomes psychological. A batsman starts thinking about it and making something of it in his head. As a bowler you look forward to bowling at them, you are confident when you are running in, you know that it is in the back of the batsman's mind. You want to build the pressure, make sure the batsman knows exactly what is going on. I think by now it is at a point where when those particular players come out to the middle, Alastair Cook or Michael Clarke can bring on those particular bowlers straight away and really make it known that they feel they have got the wood on them. There is no need to be shy about it \u2013 it is all fun and games. Having knocked him over twice in the last Test, Broad will be chomping at the bit to bowl at Clarke and if he does get him again he will be letting him know: \"That is No6, mate.\" And you do not have to confine the talking to the pitch \u2013 you can always say a few things in the media as well. Get commentators and fans talking about it, make it an issue, it all adds to the pressure. I used to come out and say I was targeting certain players in the opposition team, particularly players I had had success against in the past: Gary Kirsten, Brian Lara and Michael Atherton, for example. It is a mental part of the game. To be a good player you have to have the skills. To be a great player it is attitude and mental strength that will get you there. If you do have the wood on someone as a bowler it can grow and grow. I was always very confident whenever I bowled to Athers and by his last Test, when I got him out for the 19th and final time, he was not quite a shot duck but not far off. Then there was Shane Warne and Daryll Cullinan. Poor old Daryll was a bit of a shot duck at the end of it and probably still has nightmares now. Nothing is cast in stone, though. You look at someone like Lara, who I dismissed 15 times in Tests. Sometimes I felt like I was going to knock him over any ball, other times he came out and smoked us to all parts of the bloody field. Yet even at this stage of a series I do not know if you ever have a psychological edge as a batsman \u2013 somehow it is not quite the same. Ian Bell, for example, will be full of confidence, going out there knowing that he has scored runs against these bowlers, but I do not know if you would ever say a batsman had the wood on a bowler. Mind you, I am talking from a bowler's perspective \u2013 it would be interesting to hear what a batsman would say on the subject. One thing I do know for sure is that no matter how many runs someone has scored against you, a bowler should never be stood at the end of his run thinking: \"I've no idea how to get this bloke out.\" Never. You always have to have a plan. At the top of your mark, before you run in, you have to know exactly what type of ball you want to bowl. It should be locked in. Never did I just run in and bowl anything and hope. That would be ridiculous. If that is how you are bowling then good luck to you because you are not going to be there for very long. It is a bit of a concern for Australia that their two most reliable batsmen of the series, Clarke and Rogers, have been trapped by the same two bowlers five times each but there are always two sides \u2013 you can either come at it from a positive perspective or a negative perspective. Rogers can maybe say to himself that Swann's bowling to me, a left-hander, on a turning wicket, so conditions are in his favour. Or the other way is that you say to yourself: \"Well I have been playing well against the other bowlers.\" You have to try to justify it to yourself. Right now the Australian batsmen as a unit probably have more issues with themselves than they do with the English bowlers. The priority for them is to get their own heads straight. And they are up against it. They are really going to have to pull something out of the hat. This Test will have a big bearing on what is going to happen when the sides meet again in Australia in a couple of months. England want to keep the momentum going. Australia somehow need to turn things around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
