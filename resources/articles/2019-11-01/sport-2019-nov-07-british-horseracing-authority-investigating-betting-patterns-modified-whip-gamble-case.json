Resurrected, who is trained by Charlie McBride, was initially a 100-1 shot for the Moving Made Easy Classified Stakes on 19 September, before opening on course at 25-1 and being backed down to start at 10-1. She won by half a length but Brock was interviewed by the local stewards and issued with a \u00a3140 fine for using a modified whip with two elastic bands wound around the tip. A veterinary inspection a couple of hours later revealed the whip had made a mark on Resurrected. Brock had left the course so this aspect of the case was considered by an independent British Horseracing Authority panel on 17 October. This replaced his original fine with a seven-day suspension. Unusually for a hearing that took place three weeks ago, the panel\u2019s written reasons for its finding have yet to be published on the BHA\u2019s website. The BHA said on Thursday it \u201ccannot comment on ongoing investigations or speculation surrounding possible investigations\u201d. Resurrected, a three-year-old filly, raced at Chelmsford in the colours of Miss Charlie McPhillips having been bought for \u00a310,000 at the Tattersalls\u2019 Breeze-Up sale in May 2018 when Brock was listed as the buyer. She lined up for the Grade Six event, her first start over six furlongs, as one of the country\u2019s lowest-rated horses in training having shown no worthwhile form in three outings when she started at 150-1, 66-1 and 50-1 but had little trouble justifying strong support to beat a dozen opponents, eventually crossing the line half a length in front having led a furlong out. Brock\u2019s seven-day suspension for wealing a horse \u2013 an offence that occurs, on average, about once a year from around 90,000 starts \u2013 has been a cause of much social media discussion in recent weeks, led by Ross Clarke, the racing editor of Catena Media. The BHA said on Thursday that it may consider whether the current penalties for using a modified whip or wealing a horse are appropriate, irrespective of the outcome of any investigation into the Resurrected case. \u201cThe use of modified whips is not something that can be tolerated,\u201d Brant Dunshea, the chief regulatory officer, said on Thursday. \u201cThe rules of racing are clear on this and the welfare of our participants is our primary concern. \u201cHaving identified that Danny Brock had used a modified whip, the stewards imposed on him the standard penalty for this offence, which is a \u00a3140 fine. The horse was checked by vets immediately after the race and at that time the horse was not wealed but a second check of the horse later showed that minor weals had emerged. The jockey had left the racecourse by this time and therefore the stewards referred this second offence to be considered by the independent disciplinary panel at a later date. \u201cThe independent panel decided to replace the initial \u00a3140 fine with a seven-day suspension, which is above the standard five-day penalty for minor weals. \u201cWe have not yet received the independent panel\u2019s written reasons for their decision and are therefore unable to comment on this or the penalty they have issued. However, the BHA feels the standard penalties for an offence of this nature do not seem sufficient and will address this specifically when considering the Horse Welfare Board\u2019s broader research and recommendations regarding the whip. \u201cIn summary, the offence was identified and dealt with by the stewards and disciplinary panel in line with, and indeed above, the existing penalty framework. Whether that penalty framework remains appropriate is another matter and one we have decided to take a look at.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
