The city\u2019s population has swelled rapidly to 1.7 million and is estimated to be adding 40,000 people a year. By 2048 it could host nearly half of New Zealand\u2019s current population. In the 1980s only a couple of thousand people lived in the central city. Now some 57,000 people call it home, a figure that was not expected to be reached until 2032. Auckland is grappling to cope with that population growth. Traffic jams on clogged motorways can stretch into hours. Decades of under-funding of public transport has led to a patchwork and complicated system serving a total area of around about 1000 sq kms . The rising cost of living has spawned a growing homeless population, with some forced to live in parks or sleep in their cars, and garages are now rented out as accommodation for hundreds of dollars a week. Paul Spoonley, a sociology professor at Massey University, says the harbour city is simply bulging at the seams. \u201cInfrastructure and service provision simply has not kept up with the rate of population growth, but also because there\u2019s been a historic deficit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had enough houses in Auckland for decades, and there hasn\u2019t been a major investment in adequate public transport for a very long time.\u201d Jenna Todd, 34, and her husband, Stu, rent a home in Auckland\u2019s Mount Roskill but are actively looking to buy. Todd lists Auckland\u2019s \u201cfood, diversity, weather, and easy access to rural getaways\u201d as the major reasons she loves the city. Todd manages the popular Time Out bookstore in the inner-city suburb of Mount Eden, and has noted rising tension between suburban business areas such as hers \u201cadapting to population growth \u2013 with higher density housing, developing alternative transport to cars \u2013 and the desire to preserve heritage, views and green spaces\u201d. \u201cAuckland is spread out, which isolates our population into pockets,\u201d says Todd, who broadly welcomes further growth of Auckland\u2019s population, if better planning and infrastructure provisions are made. \u201cWe need to continue to connect suburbs with efficient public transport and safe cycleways, to encourage accessible movement throughout the city. \u201cI want people to travel to the Mount Eden village without worrying about clogged roads and parking to spend money at our locally owned businesses. I think Auckland won\u2019t be able to compare with large, international cities until this happens.\u201d Auckland is regularly ranked as one of the best cities in the world to live in, but also one of the most expensive. Spoonley says the average cost of housing is nine times the average household income. Until the 1950s, Auckland had a transport system that was the envy of the world. Its quarter of a million citizens took more than 100m trips a year, on ferries and buses but mainly on frequent, cheap, council-run trams to all points of the compass. \u201cEveryone took an average of nearly two trips per day,\u201d says Ben van Bruggen, the Londoner now in charge of Auckland council\u2019s urban design strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of level that London Underground operates at.\u201d But the city tore up the tram lines and laid down motorways. It is only now, thanks to costly investment in public transport, that many are leaving their cars at home again. \u201cTo get back to 100m public transport trips last year, that\u2019s quite a turnaround,\u201d Van Bruggen says. \u201cThat\u2019s doubled within 10 years.\u201d It doubled from a low base. The population is now nearly seven times that of the 50s, and per-capita patronage levels don\u2019t approach those of Sydney or Melbourne, for example, let alone what they might have been if the trams had been retained. And it has come at a considerable cost. Billions have been spent electrifying a suburban rail system, adding bus routes and a separate busway along the northern motorway, and shifting the terminus into the city centre. A further NZ$4bn (\u00a32bn) of taxpayer and ratepayer money is being spent on converting the terminus into a loop that will double the network\u2019s capacity by 2024. A few divided cycleways have gone in, and a long-delayed one across the harbour bridge and on to the northern suburbs is slated for next year. But more is needed. Traffic congestion is a perennial complaint for commuters and costs hundreds of millions a year in productivity. \u201cThere is no more car capacity,\u201d Van Bruggen says. Commitments have been made to new light rail lines in the next decade. Commuters complain about the cost of short bus trips and that the rail network doesn\u2019t go to enough suburbs, but South Auckland\u2019s Phyllis Jaggard and Noelene Bowden are fans of the frequent and quiet electric trains over their \u201cterrible, smelly diesel\u201d predecessors. Jaggard hardly drives into the city because of better services and reduced parking. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying when services get cancelled,\u201d she says. \u201cBut every city in the world has this problem.\u201d The city is now home to 220 ethnicities, thanks in particular to migration from Asia. About 39% of Auckland residents were born overseas, according to Penny Pirritt, director of urban growth and housing at the council, compared with a national average of 27%. It is also home to almost a quarter of New Zealand\u2019s M\u0101ori population and 65% of the nation\u2019s Pacific peoples. \u2018Getting out of its teenager angst\u2019 Despite the challenges, Auckland is \u201cmaturing and moving quite quickly\u201d, taking lessons from other global cities and its own earlier failures, Van Bruggen says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting out of its teenager angst.\u201d Old chemical storages facilities are being turned into a medium-rise residential-commercial area called Wynyard Quarter. The city\u2019s waterfront, which used to be fenced off to store imported used cars, is being opened up. Some NZ$14bn of public and private development is going on in the city centre alone. Auckland council forecasts that the city could have 2.4 million people by 2048 and need a further 313,000 dwellings and up to 263,000 extra jobs. Where will these homes go? Pirritt says the city this year approved the construction of more than 14,000 dwellings, the most since 2004. More than half are mixed-density models \u2013 townhouses, apartments, terraces and retirement villages \u2013 many close to public transport and community facilities. The city\u2019s model plans for 70% of all future growth to be within existing urban areas. A government-commissioned working group recommended in October moving the city\u2019s port north, potentially freeing up 77 hectares of prime seafront land. The city has also earmarked 15,000 hectares for future urban development, largely in the north and south. The city is also working with developers to provide affordable homes. A survey found Auckland contained 40,000 \u201cghost houses\u201d, properties empty for much of the year. Of course, many challenges still exist. Over half the country\u2019s overcrowding is in Auckland and more than 20,000 people are estimated to suffer \u201csevere housing deprivation\u201d. M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples are overrepresented in homelessness figures. The population squeeze and traffic congestion are part of the reason more than 30,000 Aucklanders left for other parts of the country in the four years to 2017, many of them older P\u0101keh\u0101 (New Zealanders of European descent), according to economist Benje Patterson. Yet Auckland\u2019s second-term mayor, Phil Goff, whose English immigrant grandfather drove a tram for 20 years, is upbeat. He told the Guardian: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a city that\u2019s transforming, both in scale and how people want to live and how they want to get around it.\u201d He is proud of getting through a 10-year transport budget that has increased 50%, and fixing the city\u2019s pipes to stop wastewater flowing into the harbours alongside stormwater. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that as we grow we have the infrastructure in place so that you don\u2019t get housing shortages, growing unaffordability and homelessness.\u201d The biggest challenge is revenue, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re saying to government, you wanted a super city: this one is 35% of [New Zealand\u2019s] population, 38% of its GDP; we\u2019ve got to have a 21st century funding system so we can make this a world-class, truly liveable city.\u201d additional reporting by Harriet Sherwood This article was amended on 28 November 2019.
