At the excellent Three Fishes in Lancashire, for instance, the entire back of the menu is taken up with a list of suppliers. But other restaurants don't seem too bothered. Their waiters can't even tell you the soup of the day. So I was delighted to see transparency in the world of supermarket vegetables this week. Welsh carrots, to be specific. Actually, they weren't just 'Welsh carrots'. That would be like saying 'French wine'. They were from Bwlchwernen Fawr in west Wales. And they've just gone into Sainsbury's. The entire bag is devoted to the backstory of Patrick Holden's carrots. It reads like a novella. And, by the end, you feel like you know the carrots personally. They aren't anonymous, from somewhere we don't know, grown by someone we don't care about. They are Patrick's carrots. Even the painting on the bag is by his daughter. What I liked most of all was the fact that the carrots were different shapes and sizes. On the bag it read, 'We oppose excessive cosmetic grading which often results in up to 40% of the crop being wasted. This is how they grow in nature.' No apologies for their general 'carrotiness' - some day all carrots will be grown this way. Simply the best Henrietta Green's Food Lovers' Fair returns to Covent Garden Market in London for the sixth year running this weekend to showcase Britain's most inspiring food and drink producers. Jimmy Docherty of Jimmy's Farm, for instance, has taken a double stand - one for food-to-go, the other for frying up his famous bacon. And Flying Fish Feasts are bringing 10 different fishcakes made from sustainably caught fish, all local to their premises in Devon. Patrick Holden and his carrots? Maybe next year. Food Lovers' Fair, today and tomorrow, 10am-6pm, Covent Garden Market, London WC2. Sharp practice Don't expect to see any women in the finals of the annual Sushi Awards 2005. They say - and 'they' are undoubtedly men - that women cannot make sushi because their hands are too warm and so will ruin the fish. Besides, all women are silly. Etc. All will be revealed at the awards ceremony, which brings together the UK's top seven sushi chefs - known as the Seven Sushi Samurai - for a demonstration at the Riverbank Park Plaza Hotel, 10 Albert Embankment, London SE1.

People who drink lite beer don't really like beer. They just like to pee a lot. If I've got a decent pint in front of me, I'm a happy man. A new 'intelligent' beermat promises to make me happier still. It not only absorbs your spills - nice - but it also sends a signal to the bar for a refill when your glass is almost empty. The only downside is the price: it's currently estimated at \u00a360, though the bods developing it at Saarland University in Germany say that should drop sharply once it goes into mass production."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
