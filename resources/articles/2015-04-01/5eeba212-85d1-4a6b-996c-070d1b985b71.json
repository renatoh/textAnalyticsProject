Barkley has been frequently linked with a move to the Etihad Stadium despite a difficult second season as an Everton regular that has included injury, loss of form and criticism from his own supporters. But Barry, who has struck up a close rapport with the 21-year-old since leaving Manchester for Goodison Park in 2013, believes the development of his fellow midfielder is better served at Everton than amid the wealth of options available to City. \u201cI think Ross is too young to make that move,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cEverton is better for his development. He\u2019s still learning the game. He\u2019s got the right manager here to push him to the next level. As soon as he reaches that next level, then there\u2019s another decision to be made.\u201d Barry and Barkley have had seasons that mirror Everton\u2019s \u2013 failing to meet expectations before helping Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team pull clear of relegation trouble with a run of four wins in five matches before Sunday\u2019s meeting with Manchester United. Experience has helped the former Aston Villa and City midfielder handle the contrast to last season, which he attributes to playing three games a week after injuries to James McCarthy and Darron Gibson denied him rest, but he has sympathy for Barkley. Barry added: \u201cI speak to Ross quite often, I sit next to him in the changing room, and you feel sorry for him sometimes because of the expectation that is getting thrown on to his shoulders. He\u2019s dealt with the pressure very well because, like the team, his form hasn\u2019t been the same as last season when he really hit the ground running. \u201cPeople are expecting goals and assists of him, week in, week out. That hasn\u2019t happened but he\u2019s still putting in good, mature performances. They haven\u2019t ended in goals or assists but he\u2019s improving as a player. He\u2019s learning different things that will eventually make him a better player. It\u2019s important for everyone around Ross to try to keep his feet on the ground. His ability and his strengths are there for everyone to see. He can go on and be a top, top player.\u201d Barry joined Everton initially on loan having been excluded from Pellegrini\u2019s plans at City, although the club\u2019s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano, were also involved in freezing out the title winner. Having seen his former club fall from champions to a fight for Champions League qualification this season, and fail to improve, the veteran believes blame lies across the board at City. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise what has happened,\u201d Barry said. \u201cHaving been in the dressing room, and knowing the characters that are in there, it just seems they\u2019ve slipped below the standards that they should be competing at week in, week out. It\u2019s pretty much the same dressing room as when I was there. The manager\u2019s taken a lot of blame. It\u2019s not fair for him to take it all, the players have got to look at themselves as have the people upstairs who bring the players in. It\u2019s not just the manager, it\u2019s the whole package who need to raise their game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
