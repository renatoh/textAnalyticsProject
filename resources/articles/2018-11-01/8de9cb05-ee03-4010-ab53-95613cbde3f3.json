He has been expecting this question and waiting months to give an answer. Ultimately, the Colombia international maintains, it was not the money Everton invested that swayed him away from Old Trafford but the time. After the isolation of Barcelona, it was important to feel wanted again. Enter Marco Silva. \u201cGood,\u201d says Mina upon mention of United, and before waiting for an interpreter to translate the full question into Spanish. He has been asked whether a lack of interest from Mourinho discouraged a move to Manchester after an eventful World Cup or, as United briefed at the height of their manager\u2019s dissatisfaction with the club\u2019s summer transfer business, Everton\u2019s willingness to pay excessive agents\u2019 fees? Marcel Brands, director of football at Everton, has rejected the latter theory, insisting a fee of \u20ac30.25m (\u00a326.4m) plus \u20ac1.5m (\u00a31.3m) add-ons was agreed at the start of negotiations with Barcelona only for the La Liga champions to hold out for six weeks for a better offer from United that never materialised. Mina\u2019s explanation is simple. \u201cThe truth is Marco spoke to me every day, telling me to come to England,\u201d he says. \u201cI have always been aware of English football while growing up in Colombia \u2013 Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton, Tottenham. But Everton, honestly, has always been an important club for me. I watched them when back in the day when [Marouane] Fellaini was playing here, I remember Aaron Lennon too but, as I said, the big thing was when I was on holiday, training and keeping fit after the World Cup, Marco was on the phone, talking to me, saying to me: \u2018Come on, come and play here with us.\u2019 The faith he showed in me was very important. I know now, sitting here, that I have made the right decision. It was the best decision I could have made. I was always focused on Everton. Any talk with Manchester United was just with my agent.\u201d Hang on, Aaron Lennon? \u201cYes,\u201d replies Mina, winking at the Everton press officer to his right. A possible stitch-up. What is not in doubt is the towering defender\u2019s connection with Jordan Pickford, the Everton goalkeeper he beat with a textbook header in the 93rd minute of England\u2019s feisty encounter with Colombia at the World Cup. Mina\u2019s equaliser sent the last-16 tie to extra time and penalties, where Pickford would emerge the hero. Or the nemesis from the Colombian perspective. The header was the first thing Mina mentioned when the two became teammates. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, I reminded him,\u201d the charismatic centre-half admits. \u201cBut I said to him: \u2018Jordan, don\u2019t worry \u2013 we are together now.\u2019 All the lads have been great but I have to say Jordan has been particularly good. He has accepted me really well, given me a great reception and really helped me out since I have got here. He is a good lad.\u201d The consolation for Mina was a third goal in three consecutive World Cup matches plus a commanding display against Harry Kane that helped increase his appeal to Premier League suitors. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d he says, when his performance against Kane is described as such. \u201cKane is a great player with great technical ability; it was a great fight. It was such an important game for both teams. It was us or them. There is a saying we have in Colombia: nobody takes my mum\u2019s food away from me. It means we fight to the death and defend everything we can. You try and get it off me! You defend the shirt to the end. I\u2019m looking forward to the chance to play against him again.\u201d Mina \u2013 and Everton \u2013 have had to be patient for his introduction into the Premier League. The defender signed with a hairline fracture in his right foot, an injury suffered at a pre-World Cup training camp and aggravated during the tournament. Once recovered, he suffered another injury when fellow summer signing Bernard landed on his left foot in training. Finally he is in line for a full debut at Chelsea on Sunday with Kurt Zouma ineligible to face his parent club. If the opening three months of his Everton career have brought frustration then Mina disguises it well. His background provides an explanation for his upbeat disposition. Mina says: \u201cThe place where I was born, Guachen\u00e9, is tough and a hard place to get out of. I remember saying to my mum when I was young: \u2018One day, I will get us out of here. I will make it and it will be big.\u2019 My family is everything. There is me, mum, dad, my younger brother [Juan Jos\u00e9] and I have a half brother [Cristion] from another relationship my dad had. We try and remain together as much as we can. It is slightly complicated as my brother is playing for a youth team in Colombia so either my mum or dad have to be with him. One of them stays with him, the other comes to see me. \u201cIf I told you everything about my childhood we would be here all day. But you draw on those experiences, it makes you tough. There is not a day goes by when I don\u2019t look back and remember what it was like to get out of the environment. It makes me all the more determined to succeed. But it is not just about succeeding. I want to help inspire people not just in my town but in Colombia as a whole. I want to set an example. I have got a foundation which is designed to help young kids stay out of trouble. It gives them sporting options to stay away from temptation. I dedicate my time to that too, so they choose the right path rather than the wrong path.\u201d The determination to succeed made Mina the first Colombian to sign for Barcelona when he moved from Palmeiras for \u20ac11.8m in January. But only six appearances followed and seven months later he was gone for a healthy profit. There is no trace of resentment at being overlooked and occasionally frozen out completely by Ernesto Valverde. \u201cI am calm, I am tranquil, because I am a big believer in not looking back,\u201d Mina insists. \u201cI tried my best in Barcelona, I trained really, really hard, but I would train with the squad and then find out I was not in the travelling group. I spent that time training alone so I was ready for when the manager called on me. It wasn\u2019t to be. When the summer came the World Cup was like payback for me. It was my chance to show what I can do. More than anything, it was a chance to do what I love doing: playing football. Now it is all about what I can achieve with this great club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
