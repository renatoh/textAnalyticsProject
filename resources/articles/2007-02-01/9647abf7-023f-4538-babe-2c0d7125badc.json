Like being a screenwriter or one of the Sugababes, it's one of those things that most people think doesn't look that hard and they'd probably be pretty good at if they could just get round to turning their hand to it. I know that's what I think. Let's look at what it involves. Step one: listen to someone moaning about their job. Step two: look sympathetic. Step three: give advice. I have just described every pub...#8209;based careers-related chat I've had since my friends and I joined the workforce. Except I don't get to do step four: collect cash and grateful thanks. I am not saying that the words \"old rope\" and \"money for\" leap to mind, but I've never been exactly sure what - if anything - a person might get from a careers coach that they couldn't get from me (except, perhaps, a lack of hangover). To which end, an experiment. Two willing volunteers to describe their work-related problem to me, and also to a careers coach. Would the advice differ? Whose would be better? Could I start charging? It would help pay for the wine. Let's look at what happened. Case one My friend Grace is a high-powered City lawyer with a salary that makes me want to fall to the ground and repent my feckless, writing ways. But despite her swish office, familiarity with business-class travel and seriously impressive command of legal jargon, she is considering a change. She is thinking of moving to the public sector, which will give her a greater sense of purpose, but far fewer pennies in the bank. I don't understand the lure of a big money salary if it means sacrificing your lifestyle. Grace works insane hours - not only is she in the office long after most of us have gone home, she's often there long after lots of us have gone to bed. I can see that financial security is a hard thing to give up - but not that hard, if there's something you'd enjoy doing more. Also, I'd get to see her in the evenings more, which would be good. Coaching someone is an in-depth process. You can't really look at a job in isolation from your whole life. You have to discuss things like meaning, values and purpose. I make it very clear that I am not an occupational expert. I'm not going to tell you what the best law firm to work for is. But I will help you understand your values and strengths and give you an action plan to work from. Normally, the process with a client would be a lot longer, but I identified that security is an important value for Grace so that is something she'd need to consider carefully if she was considering a career change to a less high-paying job. Case two Jessica is 24 and has a successful career in publishing, but last year she decided to take time out in South America and worked in an orphanage in Peru. She considered making her trip the start of a career change and investigated working for a charity or aid organisation. But on returning, she wanted to move back to London as quickly as possible, as her friends and social life are important to her. The easiest way was to slip back into her old career - and now she's wondering if she's missed the chance to do something different. This is tricky. Jessica is excellent at her job and seems to enjoy it. If she seemed miserable I'd be all for making the change, but I'm not sure that it's worth the upheaval and hassle for a vague idea of wanting to do something more worthwhile. I understand the industry that Jessica currently works in very well, and I can see how her career is likely to progress in it. I wouldn't know where to start with charities. What do people who work for them actually do? I'd have to give up at that point. I think she should stay put for the time being. I told Jenny that she could think about ways that she could apply the skills she already has to what she wants to do. There are quite practical ways to do that. She can take her knowledge of publishing and media and approach charities that she's interested in to see if they'd like her to work with them as a freelance. I also suggested some of the smaller, under-the-radar charities might be approached as they're more likely to be in need of freelance help. I also think she should block off a couple of days in her diary and set aside the time to consider what she wants to do - which she didn't have time to do when she got back from travelling. OK. So, maybe there is slightly more to career coaching than I first thought, though it is based in common sense - naturally something I have vast reserves of. Career coach Jessica agrees: \"They are the kind of things that you could probably figure out for yourself if you spent long enough thinking about it, \" she says. \"But it does pull them to the forefront of your mind.\" Grace adds: \"Even if what is being said to you is something you already thought, it helps that it's a professional saying it. You pay more attention since you know it must be a valid point.\" And even with excellent and sensible friends to turn to, can their advice match up to that of someone with years of experience? \"Because they love you, friends aren't capable of being objective,\" says Ungless. \"I've seen clients who've had their career dreams squashed by a well-meaning friend saying: 'I don't see you doing that.' There's all sorts of psychological stuff that can be going on, like jealousy and envy. Even if it's not negative, the emotional baggage can get in the way.\" I know that I sometimes tell my friends what they want to hear. When it's an area I don't know anything about - like the law - I will support their feelings, but am in no position to advise. Especially as I don't want to be around if I get the advice wrong. Jessica thinks that at the end of the day, it depends how good your friends are. I think, though, that if you've been talking round the same old issue with your mates for years, there might be an argument for calling in some extra help to move you on from \"talking\" to \"doing\". Realising that and knowing there's no industry regulation and plenty of money to be made, I consider setting up as a career coach. For the two seconds it takes to realise it means a life of listening to people talk about their jobs, without being able to drink wine at the same time. No thanks. I'll stick to my amateur status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
