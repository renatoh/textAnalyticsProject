That's the showbiz mantra, the scout's honour for those of us who tread the boards. As a motto it sums up the gusto, the verve, the never-say-die attitude required to bring a show to the stage no matter what obstacles life puts in one's way. It is, of course, a load of nonsense. There are obviously good reasons why shows sometimes don't go on. I'm writing this from a luxury apartment on the 41st floor of a Chicago skyscraper when, if all had gone to plan, I would have been in a Fort Lauderdale hotel. Unfortunately, Hurricane Wilma also had a tour schedule which was meant to take in Fort Lauderdale at the same time and, well, that town just ain't big enough for the two of us. Days before we were both due to appear I did the gentlemanly thing and stepped aside to let Wilma take the headlines. To be honest, she'd been all over the papers and had features on almost every news channel, while all my publicists could rustle up was one appearance on WTVJ's Today in South Florida, so it was the obvious thing to do. The decision was actually taken jointly by the venue and the producers who decided that if we did go to Fort Lauderdale our safety couldn't be guaranteed. When that's the case, I for one don't have much time for any of that show-must-go-on nonsense. My vote goes to the safety-guaranteed option every time. I'm sorry if this damages my reputation as a trouper but believe me, if I'd been playing in the band on board the Titanic I wouldn't have stoically played on while the ship went down - whatever the musicians' union might have had to say about the matter. When the decision to cancel my Fort Lauderdale shows was made, the weather forecasters were telling us that Wilma was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded and that she was set to hit the area on the Saturday, right in the middle of my short run. It seemed likely that Fort Lauderdale would have to be evacuated and the decision was by far the only sensible choice. As it was she slowed down a bit, lost some power and didn't turn up until late on the Sunday. And while she did do some pretty bad damage, she was a shadow of her former self. It turns out that I could have performed all my shows and high-tailed it out of town before she tried to tear the roof off the place, but we weren't to know that at the time. Heigh-ho. I've never had to cancel a show because of a hurricane before. It certainly lends a level of drama and excitement to events that my years of UK touring have never been able to deliver. As it goes, no one has yet explained to me why my producer's hastily arranged Plan B involved coming to Chicago or whose luxury apartment I'm currently staying in. What I can tell you (and anyone who's ever taken a cab from O'Hare Airport into the centre of Chicago already knows this) is that Plan B hasn't exactly guaranteed my safety either. \u00b7 Dave Gorman (davegorman.com) is on tour in the US.
