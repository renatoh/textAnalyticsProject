The paper reports how journalists \"sobbed\" as he announced he had decided to leave after weeks of mounting pressure following the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal. Raines took the helm of the 152-year-old broadsheet just days before the September 11 terrorist attacks and led his team to a record seven Pulitzer prizes last year. But his reputation as a manager came under question in the last turbulent few weeks. He and his managing editor, Gerald Boyd, who also resigned today, have taken the blame for hiring Blair after it emerged he had fabricated stories and lifted material from rival publications. Journalists around the world discussed Blair's disgrace in their newspapers, magazines and news programmes, wondering how such a scandal could have happened on such a reputable paper. To compound matters the Times' Pulitzer prize-winning correspondent Rick Bragg quit last week amid accusations he relied too heavily on the work of a freelance. \"Howell Raines and Gerald M Boyd, the two top-ranking editors of the New York Times, resigned this morning, five weeks to the day after the resignation of a wayward reporter named Jayson Blair set off a rapid chain of events that exposed deep fissures in the management and morale of the newsroom they had led for just under two years,\" wrote New York Times reporter Jacques Sternberg today on the paper's website, making clear the link between Blair and today's resignations. Sternberg went on to describe a \"hastily arranged ceremony\" in the paper's third-floor newsroom at which the Times publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, praised Raines and Boyd \"for putting the interests of this newspaper, a newspaper we all love, above their own\". Joe Lelyveld, who was Raines' predecessor as executive editor, is returning to edit the paper on an interim basis. \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
