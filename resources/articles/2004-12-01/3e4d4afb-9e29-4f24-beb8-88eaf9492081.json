The memorandum of understanding the RFL has signed with Betfair - following racing, football, cricket and tennis - would not have helped detect the bets placed by St Helens' Sean Long and Martin Gleeson against the weakened Saints team that lost at Bradford on Easter Monday after they opened telephone accounts with the bookmaker Stan James. The RFL has made one significant move against a repeat of that situation by forcing Super League coaches to name a squad 72 hours before each match. Betfair will alert the RFL to any suspicious patterns of betting on the online exchanges - where league has a fast-growing presence - and the RFL hopes to reach similar agreements with other bookmakers before the start of next season. \"It is part of a systemic approach to underpin the integrity of our competition,\" said the RFL's chief operating officer Nigel Wood. London Broncos have signed Danny Williams, a former Melbourne hooker who played for Ireland in the 2000 World Cup, even though he is only halfway through an 18-match suspension. Williams was banned for a high off-the-ball tackle in a game against Wests Tigers in July and cannot play for the Broncos until April. Professional rugby league's return to Blackpool next year was finally confirmed yesterday when the Blackpool Panthers signed a two-year lease to play at Bloomfield Road. They will take the place of Chorley Lynx in LHF National League Two but their first match will be a friendly against St Helens at the end of January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
