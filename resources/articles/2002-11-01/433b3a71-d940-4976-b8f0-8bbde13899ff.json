Fares will be from 23-40 euros (\u00a313-\u00a325) and the flights will take 10-30 minutes compared with ferry journeys of up to nine hours. A limited service on 30- or 40-seat aircraft will start in February, followed by a busier summer timetable from April to October. Details will be posted in January when the newly formed Ionian Islands Tourist Board launches its website (visit-ionianislands.com)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
