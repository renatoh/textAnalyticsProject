A contentious vote on whether to leave Goodison Park for Kirkby received majority approval from the club's support yesterday, with a contract to construct a new \u00a3150m stadium in the town expected to be signed within the next two months. Everton, Knowsley Council and Tesco are all to commit to the \u00a3400m development in Kirkby after 59% of the 36,662 Evertonians eligible to vote backed a project that has bitterly divided supporters. Electoral Reform Services, called in by the club to oversee the vote, confirmed that 15,230 people were in favour of the move and 10,468 (41%) against. There were 10,901 abstentions and 63 ballot papers were declared invalid. The announcement gives a clear mandate to Everton to proceed with their plans for a 50,000-seater stadium at minimal cost to the club, although the Keep Everton in Our City Campaign - who chartered a private plane to fly a protest banner above Goodison Park on the opening day of the season - have vowed to continue their fight. Knowsley Council will donate land and Tesco will pay the bulk of the construction costs for the stadium, prompting Everton's chief executive, Keith Wyness, to hail the scheme as \"the deal of the century\". Work on the project could begin as early as spring next year, although planning permission has still to be obtained and the government could call in the plans should local residents mount a challenge to the development. \"The project is going to cost around \u00a3150m but Everton will only be faced with a debt of between \u00a310m and \u00a315m,\" said Wyness. \"Tesco are putting in \u00a350m towards the cost of the stadium, but they have negotiated a deal with their own contractors. This means we will be getting a stadium building that would otherwise have cost \u00a375m. There is then the cost of fitting out the new stadium. The sale of Goodison Park will realise up to \u00a315m and naming rights will earn us up to \u00a325m. That will leave the club to fund the balance of the fitting out costs and we think that could be as low as \u00a310m.\" Middlesbrough's manager Gareth Southgate claims he was powerless to prevent Ayegbeni Yakubu moving to Everton after the Nigeria striker's \"head was turned\" by persistent speculation linking him with the switch. Although Yakubu's \u00a311.25m transfer has been delayed by Everton's need to secure a work permit for his services he is expected to join David Moyes's squad next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
