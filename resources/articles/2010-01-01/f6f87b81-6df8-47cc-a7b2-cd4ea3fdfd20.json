After failing against the French league leaders here, they face the English champions in the meanest of form and currently sitting on top of the group. Despite the brightest of starts, the Welsh were squeezed out of the game, remaining pointless after the first seven minutes. As has happened to many sides at the Stade Marcel Michelin, they found that Clermont's Australian fly-half, Brock James, was orchestrating the play. The Australian has played better \u2013 he missed three kickable penalties \u2013 but from seven points down, in the blink of an eye, he first calmed French nerves and then put their noses in front. Late tries by the wingers Julien Malzieu and then Napolioni Nalaga \u2013 from an intercept three minutes from time \u2013 merely added the gloss and the points difference, should Clermont need it after they have visited hapless Viadana next week. Ospreys went into the game four points clear after back-to-back wins over the Italians, but looked like a side who would have been happy with one losing bonus point. Shane Williams was back after damaging his hamstring in the autumn internationals, but he was on the bench alongside James Hook, who must wonder where his future lies. Even though Cardiff and a few English teams would love to have the 22-year-old on their books, Hook was yesterday rated only second best at fly-half (to Dan Biggar), at inside centre (Andrew Bishop) and at full-back (Lee Byrne). Talent to burn, it seems. But within a minute the Ospreys line was cruising, with Biggar, Sonny Parker and Byrne opening Clermont up, only for Tommy Bowe to trip over his own feet. Nalanga suffered similarly at the other end, winning the foot race for Anthony Floch's chip, only for the Irish TV referee, Brian Stirling, to rule that he had lost control of the ball. However, Bowe was not to be denied. The Irish wing \u2013 who resisted all sorts of blandishments to return home last week, signing another contract with the Ospreys \u2013 kept up his record of scoring in every round so far, when the cast list that combined in the first minute did the same six minutes later. This time, Bowe kept his footing to scoot home and, after Biggar had converted, Ospreys could have been 12 points ahead had Ricky Januarie concentrated on touching down rather than celebrating after crossing the line. As it was, the steady right foot of James got to work, as it has done against so many sides sensing victory in the Massif Central, and the seven-point gap was whittled down to four as Clermont cut off Ospreys' possession. Ospreys indiscretions saw James in action again and after 21 minutes there was just a point in it. Clermont should have taken the lead 11 minutes later when a couple of Jerry Collins tackles had the Stade Marcel Michelin baying. For once James missed, but five minutes from half-time he eased a third kick over as an encore to show the full James catalogue. First came a drop goal \u2013 half-time lead 12-7 \u2013 followed by towering kicks into the rain and angled punts that turned Ospreys on their heel. With 20 minutes left Byrne fumbled a steepling kick from James, and Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie had no problem putting Malzieu in the corner and the game beyond Ospreys, as Adam Jones watched the last 10 minutes from the sin bin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
