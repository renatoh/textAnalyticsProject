The Programme for International Student Assessment results, released on Tuesday evening, confirm a continuing long-term decline in Australian students\u2019 reading, mathematics and science skills. There are now 10 countries with \u201csignificantly higher\u201d results in reading than Australia, 23 in maths and 12 in science. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said the results were \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and \u201cshould have alarm bells ringing\u201d but pushed responsibility on to the states rather than revisiting the issue of federal funding to improve results. Tehan said that the education council meeting of ministers next week \u201cprovides the opportunity to reset\u201d the agenda, calling on states to be \u201cbold\u201d and sign up to reforms proposed in the second Gonski report including to implement a curriculum broken up into smaller \u201clearning progressions\u201d. But Australian Education Union federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said \u201cextra teaching resources that would become available by ensuring that all schools are funded at the [schools resourcing standard] benchmark is key in closing this performance gap\u201d. The Pisa test makes international comparisons between 15-year-old students, who are nearing the end of compulsory schooling. In 2018, some 600,000 students in 79 countries were tested, including an Australian sample of 14,273 students in 740 schools. Compared with students in the highest performing country, Singapore, Australian students are one and a third years behind in reading, around three years behind in mathematics and one and three quarter years behind in science. The Australian Council for Educational Research deputy chief executive, Sue Thomson, said Australia was \u201ca developed, wealthy western country with justifiably high aspirations for our students so we must take notice of these results\u201d. Australian students have been left behind due to a \u201cpattern of improvement in maths performance in comparable countries that just isn\u2019t replicated in Australia\u201d, she said. Since testing began in 2000, five countries which were on par in mathematics overtook Australia, while of the 16 countries with lower maths scores, nine now outperform Australia and seven are on par with Australia. In maths a \u201csignificant gender gap\u201d which had closed in 2015 opened back up in the 2018 tests in favour of male students. Maths results were down in all states and territories with South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory recording the biggest declines. In reading and science, Australia\u2019s average scores (503) were still ahead of the OECD averages of 487 and 489 respectively. Average performance in reading was down in all states and territories except Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory, and in science everywhere except Victoria and the NT. Labor\u2019s shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the results were \u201ca huge wake-up call for Scott Morrison and the Liberals, who\u2019ve seen school test scores plummet on their watch\u201d. \u201cIf our kids can\u2019t read, write, and do maths and science, then we\u2019ve failed.\u201d Haythorpe said the results showed a gap in the performance of students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds compared with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cFederal Coalition budget cuts have had a deep impact on public schools. We need to invest in our schools to close the education gaps between high SES and low SES students.\u201d Tehan flagged federal pressure on the states to advance a raft of reforms including implementing the Gonski report, embed phonics as part of teacher training, and decluttering curriculums to \u201cget back to basics\u201d. \u201cAustralia should be a leader in school education,\u201d he said. \u201cOur students should be ranked among the best in the world. We should not accept anything less. \u201cMy message to the state and territory education ministers is this: leave the teachers\u2019 union talking points at home and be ambitious. \u201cMoney is not the issue because Estonia was the top-performing country in reading and science and they spend half as much money per student as Australia.\u201d But Thomson told Guardian Australia that although the commonwealth does not control education, funding is a joint responsibility of both federal and state governments and \u201cresourcing is obviously a part of the whole equation\u201d. While addressing \u201ccrowded\u201d curriculums may help, Thomson warned against a \u201cback to basics\u201d approach, which can lead teachers to \u201cteach to the middle\u201d and fail to help weaker students. Thomson also called for more specialist maths teachers and more training for people teaching maths although it is not their main field."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
