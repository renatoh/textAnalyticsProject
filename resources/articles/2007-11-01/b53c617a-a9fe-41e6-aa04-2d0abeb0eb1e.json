The universities' secretary, John Denham, set out new funding arrangements in a letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England late on Friday September 7. The letter called for support for people studying for a second degree to be \"phased out\" and reduced by \u00a3100m a year over the next four years. The move sparked anger among institutions such as the Open University and Birkbeck, University of London, which teach many students who already have degrees, but wish to return to higher education. Yesterday the Conservative MP Rob Wilson accused the government of trying to bury news of the funding changes. \"The funding change was sneaked out over the summer. It appears the government doesn't wish to support graduates who need to retrain,\" he said. In answer to oral questions in the Commons, the higher education minister, Bill Rammell, said the sum was being \"reprioritised\". \"Spending public money to give people who already have a degree a second degree, while 70% of adults in the working age population do not have even their first degree, is not the right priority,\" he said. But the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Sarah Teather, said institutions like the OU expected to lose up to \u00a332m in funding as a result. \"Do you value the contribution of institutions like the OU and how can you equate that with your statements about wanting to have a flexible workforce,\" she asked. Rammell said: \"It is simply not the case that the OU will lose that amount of money.\" He said he had make this clear to the university and that no institution would lose in cash terms. \"We are not cutting funding from higher education. We are saying that \u00a3100m over three years ought to be reprioritised from those people who already have undergraduate qualifications to those who do not have even their first degree. I believe that that is the right priority in public policy terms.\" However, the universities secretary added that there would be \"transitional protection\" for the OU and other institutions. Denham said of the OU: \"I cannot think of an institution better able to offer new forms of higher education to those millions of people in the adult workforce who have never been to university, never had the chance of higher education but will need to do so in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
