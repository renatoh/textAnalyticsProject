Even on his soon-to-conclude leave of absence his benign influence endures. Grace Reid climbed the stairs on the final attempt of the very last round of the 3m springboard competition at the European Diving Championships in her native Edinburgh with either a medal or despair hanging in the balance. A voice of experience rang in her ears. She lay third after four rounds. Her British teammate Alicia Blagg headed the standings but could only watch and wait. Daley, who won the mixed synchro title in tandem with Reid at the 2016 Europeans in London, had given his frequent partner clear and solid advice. \u201cNot to be afraid to lead from the front,\u201d she revealed. And the Scot, unafraid and nerveless, delivered somersaults and then a twist in the tale to snatch dramatic gold. Midway through an Olympic cycle these are the moments that can shape the two years ahead. To learn to win, as the 22-year-old has accomplished both here and at April\u2019s Commonwealth Games, has immense value. Eighth in the murky green waters of Rio 2016, Reid has soaked up lessons from working in tandem with Daley and his long-time coach, Jane Figueiredo, since relocating to London 18 months ago. In the past she was merely an aspirant. Now she is firmly an achiever. \u201cHere I qualified in second. I\u2019ve not been there before. But if Tom was here, he\u2019d have told me: \u2018This is good. You\u2019re the one being chased so embrace it.\u2019 And I really did that.\u201d Blagg, who is currently based at the University of Miami, saw progress even in feeling victory slip painfully away. She said: \u201cIt was about performing. The medal was a bonus.\u201d It made it three for the day for the hosts with world championship medallists Matty Lee and Lois Toulson claiming silver in the 10m mixed synchro behind Russia\u2019s Nikita Shleikher and Iulia Timoshinina Reid will return on Sunday to pursue a third medal of the week in the 3m synchro in partnership with Kat Torrance. Daley will doubtless watch and feel pride at his role in spawning a new force. Reid confirmed she was braver for his influence. \u201cNo medals are won playing safe, so I gave everything I had \u2013 and it came off.\u201d Meanwhile Great Britain\u2019s men\u2019s quintet of Max Whitlock, Dom Cunningham, James Hall, Joe Fraser and Courtney Tulloch took silver in the team competition at the European Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow as Russia successfully defended their title. A slim chance of gold for the hosts was extinguished in their final round when Hall and Cunningham both suffered falls on the concluding high bars. And it allowed the Russians to secure victory on 257.260 points, almost four clear of GB with France taking bronze. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the bar,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cI\u2019ve never done that in my life. I didn\u2019t even know where I was when I fell off. It\u2019s been weird but this is gymnastics.\u201d Whitlock will attempt to regain his pommel title in Sunday\u2019s individual apparatus finals but will expect a ferocious challenge from the Northern Irish challenger Rhys McClenaghan. The 25-year-old Englishman was more solid here than in qualifying but he lacks the air of impregnability which has surrounded him for so long. \u201cI wanted to go through the routines as best as I can,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt has given me a lot of confidence to push my pommel routine as best I can. I look back at London 2012, as far back as that. And I had the mind-set of going all out and giving it my best shot. That\u2019s what I have to do every single competition.\u201d If not anxiety, there is an air of fallibility surrounding the double Olympic champion. McClenaghan bested him at the Commonwealths. Whitlock badly needs to respond. \u201cThe nerves are slightly different,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI put a lot of pressure on myself. That\u2019s one thing I need to take off as much as I possibly can. I look at every competition and I want to do my best. My motivation is to retain titles.\u201d Elsewhere Britain\u2019s Kyle Evans and Kye Whyte claimed European gold and silver in the men\u2019s BMX final in Glasgow with France\u2019s world champion, Sylvain Andr\u00e9, settling for third. \u201cThe top six in the world are all from Europe, so it\u2019s never going to be easy,\u201d Evans, 24, said. \u201cI worked hard at home and it paid off.\u201d Laura Smulders of the Netherlands won the women\u2019s event. Iceland were the surprise maiden gold medallists of golf\u2019s new European Team Championships, picking up a trio of late birdies to win the mixed foursomes event at Gleneagles on three under par, one shot ahead of the unheralded British quartet of Meghan Maclaren, Michele Thomson, Liam Johnston and Connor Syme. With the individual silver medallist Jess Learmonth and Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee opting out, a makeshift GB lineup finished a lowly 12th in triathlon\u2019s mixed relay in Motherwell with France earning the European title ahead of Switzerland and Belgium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
