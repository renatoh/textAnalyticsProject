Following the excellent Greekadelica album, with its inventive reworking of traditional material, comes this unexpected and often furious treatment of classic low-life songs from the beginning of the last century. Mavrika are a London-based Greek band specialising in rembetika: stories of druggy wide boys, gamblers or canny and corrupt women. Guitarist and producer Chris Morphitis found the songs among his dad's records, and they are reworked with a brooding, contemporary intensity. Singer Katina Kangaris has a cool, no-nonsense approach contrasting with fierce guitar and bouzouki work from Morphitis, helped by violin and oud from Hassan Erraji. Gypsy Girl, from 1933, sounds like a dark, rumbling underground rock workout here, while 1927's Derbederisa veers from jaunty to sudden bursts of furious guitar work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
