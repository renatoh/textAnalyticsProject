The criticism came as FA board members prepared to conduct an emergency conference-call on Thursday to discuss the futures of the under-fire triumvirate Greg Clarke, Martin Glenn and Dan Ashworth. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP, the shadow sport minister, joined Kick it Out, Gary Lineker and the sport minister Tracey Crouch in demanding the FA heeds the lessons from a furore that finally ended with the 102-cap England player Aluko being vindicated in parliament on Wednesday. \u201cIt is clear the leadership of the Football Association is incapable of dealing with allegations of bullying and racism,\u201d Allin-Khan told the Guardian. \u201cAfter hearing the evidence and the lack of accountability shown, I have lost confidence in the FA\u2019s leadership team. The senior leadership team at the FA need to have a long, hard look at themselves and the board need to act quickly and decisively to take the FA in a new direction.\u201d Crouch said: \u201cI hope the FA learns lessons from this whole sorry saga to ensure that all in the sport and the wider public have faith in their processes and procedures. We have been clear that we expect world-leading standards of governance from all our national sports\u2019 governing bodies.\u201d The FA did respond by confirming it would investigate the England Women\u2019s goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall following, it said, \u201cnew evidence that came to light on Wednesday alleging unacceptable behaviour towards Eniola Aluko during an England camp\u201d. Kendall was accused of regularly speaking to Aluko in a fake Caribbean accent during the evidence presented before the digital, culture, sport and media committee. The Guardian understands Kendall may even be sent home before Friday\u2019s game against France in Valenciennes. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick it Out, echoed Allin-Khan\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe FA\u2019s board should be considering as a matter of urgency the implication of Eni Aluko\u2019s case,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should ask who is responsible for the fiasco, who is culpable and whether they should be disciplined. The bottom line is they should be building trust and confidence that the FA can be a governing body for all of football, that people of whatever background can bring forward a criticism or a grievance and do so without threat of victimisation or being penalised.\u201d Ouseley stopped short of calling for the removal of the FA chief executive, Glenn, or the chairman, Clarke, both of whom are believed to retain the support of the FA board despite their humiliation in parliament. Ouseley\u2019s sentiment was shared by Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe. \u201cI don\u2019t think multiple changes of leadership have a good effect,\u201d Powar said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three or four chairmen in the past decade and they have all faced the same problems; the power struggle within football, bringing about good governance and transparency and keeping up with the expectation of a sport that attracts the attention of everyone in England. \u201cThe FA appears to be governed by a culture of spin, with an answer to everything but no solutions. There is a need for a change of culture but, I would add, also in change of perspective. Clearly they need a Chief Diversity Officer who can drive forward change in all areas of diversity.\u201d On Twitter, Gary Lineker observed: \u201cInstead of trying to silence Eni Aluko, the FA should give this impressive young woman a voice to change things from within the institution.\u201d Who is on the FA Board?
