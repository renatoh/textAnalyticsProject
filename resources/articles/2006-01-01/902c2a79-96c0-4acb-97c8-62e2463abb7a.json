He looks like Mr Burns, manages like Mr Magoo (minus the happy endings), and we can't think of another Mr to continue this laboured intro but you get the point. Despite that, however, his latest scandal (sic) is the biggest load of nonsense involving a powerful figure since George Galloway started lapping up Rula Lenska. What's all the fuss about? Sven likes earning shed-loads of money? Quelle surprise! Sven loves David Beckham so much he'd probably lace his own perma-tanned girlfriend with an AK-47 just to keep him in the team? Never! Michael Owen doesn't really want to be at Jongleurs FC? Who'da thunk it! The only surprise - and the News of the Screws genuinely included this, like it added to the drama or something - is that Sven told the fake sheikh all this over crab cakes and lobster! \"I do not feel I have embarrassed the players,\" said Sven, at a bargain \u00a3500 a syllable. \"It would have been better without the article, of course, but having spoken to them about it there is no problem.\" And don't take Sven's word for it, because here's Fat Freddy Shepherd wheezing his way into the picture! \"We have spoken with [Michael Owen] and he has confirmed he is happy at Jongleurs FC,\" he wahayed. So that's that then. That's only three paragraphs, however, and as we have four to fill, here's squinty-eyed sidekick Tord Grip with more of the same. \"He has been through a lot of things,\" he said, divulging too much about Sven's love life for comfort. \"But this was something very special, because it was a real set-up. It's not nice, because then you can't trust anybody,\" he continued, frisking the Fiver for wires with uncomfortable zeal. \"But I know that Sven is OK and he's fully committed to the job,\" he continued, failing to specify exactly which job that is. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"One of the Bolton players has been saying I intentionally go out and try to hurt opponents. That's totally unjustified and I have to defend myself. You're going to mis-time a few tackles when you make as many as I do. I've never been sent off in my club career. If anyone can show me a tape of when I've gone over the top I'd like to see it. I've played 422 games and never gone over the top once. I've had three days of ridicule but I haven't made a bad tackle all season\" - red cards or no red cards, is it just us that wonders why such a fair-play merchant as Blackeye Rovers' Robbie Savage constantly has to speak out in his own defence? ********************* AT LEAST IT'S NOT SVEN AND STEVE McCLAREN The unveiling of Stan Staunton and Rir Sobby O'Bobson as the Republic of Ireland's new managerial dream team in Dublin this morning was eerily reminiscent of what passed for today's Fiver editorial meeting, as a clatter of bleary-eyed, hungover hacks sat around laughing hysterically at jokes that weren't funny while applauding those seated at the top table as if their every utterance was a demonstration of quippery worthy of Oscar Wilde himself. \"I'm the boss. I'm the gaffer,\" drawled the man they call Stan, who will surely face more testing press conferences than this one prior to his 2008 dismissal. \"At the end of the day what I say goes. The buck stops with me. I will use Sobby in whatever role I see fit. He has a huge role to play.\" And as Irish football fans prayed that Stan's notoriously absent-minded mentor's role wouldn't be Person In Charge Of Remembering To Bring Training Kit, Footballs And Isotonic Drinks To World Cup Training Camps, the new gaffer assured them that such a job may well become available. \"We are here to achieve success. Our aim is to qualify for the European Championships and World Cups,\" continued Stan, in a Louth brogue sounding like a steamroller pulling a trailer-load of pancakes and spirit-levels across Montana. And lest Roy Keane should accuse him of lacking ambition, Stan went on to stress that these were merely his initial goals: \"First and foremost that is our aim,\" he burred. \"We want to get the team up and running again, get the fans behind us and show them we are heading in the right direction.\" Once the assembled hacks defiantly waved their knobbly sticks and ole-ole-oled their new messiah to within an inch of his life, his distinguished henchman spoke. \"It's great to be back here at Ipswich Town where I've spent so many happy years,\" toora-looed Rir Sobby. \"There's nothing Dan and I won't do to try to bring success to Chinese table-tennis. Now pass me the giant novelty scissors, point me in the direction of the ribbon and I'll declare this supermarket open.\" ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Bad news for Arsenal, good news for Southampton and Theo Walcott's Chelsea-supporting dad: the Blues are planning to hijack Arsene Wenger's move for the 16-year-old. If that wasn't bad enough, Olympiakos midfielder Yaya Toure would rather play for Lyon than alongside his brother Kolo and Pascal Cygan. West Brom are ready to pip Manchester City to Betis midfielder Garcia Azu's scrawl. Clearly impressed by the way South Korea's Ahn Jung-hwan put noses out of joint after knocking Italy out of the last World Cup, Blackeye Rovers boss Mark Hughes has brought the striker to Ewood Park on trial. And Fiorentina's teenage Bulgarian international striker Valeri Bozhinov has bullishly vowed to sign for one of Bayern Munich, Inter or Hamburg by the weekend. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Liverpool pair Stevie Me and Luis Garcia have both been named in the Uefa website's Team of the Year 2005, alongside Chelsea's Petr Cech and John Terry. Astute voters snubbed both Frank Lampard and Thierry Henry. We're sick of all the \"Bent double\" headlines already: Charlton have agreed a GBP2.5m fee with Everton to make Marcus a team-mate of fellow striker Darren. North of the border, the Queen's Celtic have counted out GBP500,000 in used notes and exchanged them for Dundee United midfielder Mark Wilson. An FA disciplinary commission will hear the MU Rowdies' appeal against Cristiano Ronaldo's derby-day dismissal tomorrow. And Wycombe have opened their Adams Park gates for anyone wishing to pay their respects to midfielder Mark Philo, who died in a car crash on Saturday. \"He lived for football and always had a smile on his face,\" manager John Gorman said of the 21-year-old. * * * * * * * * * * WIN A SWANKY SAMSUNG D600 PHONE Send your best sporting picture - Phil Taylor throwing a dart, Sam Allardyce throwing a hissy-fit, a bent greyhound throwing a race ... whatever - taken with your mobile to the.gallery@observer.co.uk now.
