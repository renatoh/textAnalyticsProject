With 99% of the results in, Obama has 68% to Hillary Clinton's 31%, his second substantial win of the evening following his victory by a similar margin in Nebraska. Washington state, though, is a much bigger fish: it has 78 pledged delegates at stake, and a quick calculation suggests Obama wins around 52 delegates, compared with 26 for Hillary Clinton - a net gain of 26 delegates for Obama. Local media reports the usual huge turn-out in Washington, double the number who voted in 2004 and bringing out many who had never caucused before - showing again that the contest is generating wide interest among grassroots Democrats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
