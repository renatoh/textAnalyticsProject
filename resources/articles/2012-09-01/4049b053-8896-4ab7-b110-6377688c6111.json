There were opportunities to display a little patriotic fervour, with Bethany Woodward taking silver in the T37 200 metres, for athletes with cerebral palsy. The sprinter drove through the last 50m to take second place in a tight finish.Without stopping smiling for a second, the 20-year-old explained that she had no idea she had won a medal before looking up at the board to find herself in second place, with Namibia's 22-year-old Johanna Benson taking gold. \"I felt like I got everything that I could possibly do right in that race,\" she said. \"There's only one chance out there and I was always going to give my utmost.\" She added: \"Paralympic sport has never ever seen anything like this before and, if the public falls in love with it just as much as we have fallen in love with it, then that will be great to have all that support.\" Woodward, who took gold at the world championships, explained that holding form with her condition was a constant challenge. \"It's like a brick wall you have to break through to get it done,\" she said. \"The CP [cerebral palsy] side is lazy and, it's a constant battle to push through that and say actually, 'No you are going to do something great here.' I was going 'Come on! Push it' and my body listened.\" Maria Seifert of Germany took bronze while Wales's Jenny McLoughlin, 20, came fifth. But there was no place in the final for the reigning world champion Katrina Hart after she finished a shock fifth in her opening heat. The middle-distance runner David Devine also took a last-minute bronze in the T12 800m final, to match his bronze in the T12 1500m on Tuesday. The 20-year-old Liverpudlian looked off the pace for much of the race, trailing in fourth until the final 100m. But as the roar of the crowd grew he found rocket boosters in his spikes as the Cuban Lazaro Rashid started to fade. \"I thought it was all over because my legs felt so bad, like they had no zip in them \u2013 but I thought I've got 100m left of my championship, so I gave it everything,\" he said. \"Luckily enough I caught the Cuban on the line so I'm over the moon really to get another medal.\" Devine has not had the ideal lead-up to these Games, getting food-poisoning two months ago from a batch of dodgy prawns that left him violently ill for nine days. He lost 12lb and was unable to train, getting back to full strength only two weeks before the Games. He thanked the 80,000-strong crowd, who seemed to give him the last ounce of strength he needed in the final straight. \"Without the crowd I wouldn't have got a place today, so thank you to everyone in the crowd. I'm probably never going to hear it again and it was unbelievable,\" he said. The noise of the crowd would be his most treasured memory of the Games, he added. \"The 80,000 people in the stadium cheering me so much and all the messages I've had on Facebook and Twitter have been amazing. I can't thank everyone enough, they've just been unbelievable.\" Sally Brown \u2013 born with a condition which prevented her left arm from developing fully \u2013 came sixth in the T46 100m after just getting into the final. The evening got off to a flying start with Great Britain's Jonnie Peacock, the 19-year-old sprinter, leading the field the in the T44 \u2014 the classification for below-knee amputees \u2014 100m with the fastest time of 11.08. Peacock threw down the marker to Oscar \"Blade-runner\" Pistorius, who also won his heat in 11.18. The night included some strong showings for different countries, at times all in the same event. The medal ceremony for the men's F32/33 shot put saw three Algerians on the podium, with Kamel Kardjena taking gold. Brazil made it one, two, three in the women's T11 100m \u2013 the category for visually impaired athletes. The gold medal winner Terezinha Guilhermina, with tattoos and a sequin-encrusted eye-mask, gave an extra show for the crowd with her running guide Guilherme Soares de Santana \u2013 spinning each other round as they wrapped themselves in their flag. The six Brazilians \u2013 athletes and guides \u2013 took to the podium in style, one carried over the threshold, one lifted up, the winners doing an impromptu salsa to take their gold medals. All six belted out their national anthem, waving their bouquets \u2013 and gave the crowd just a taste of the flamboyance Rio might hold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
