A good performance live on TV can re-ignite our campaign.\" Moxey looked forward to the return of Mark Kennedy and Colin Cameron from injury for the Stoke game but suggested that Wolves had been missing more than just a couple of midfielders. \"We have to cut out the errors and start rebuilding confidence,\" he said, \"and everyone here is trying to do that.\" Wolves, who spent most of last season in second place before being edged out by their neighbours West Brom and then losing out to Norwich in the play-off semi-final, are 17 points behind the First Division leaders Portsmouth. \"It's important to get back to winning ways and we haven't got to be looking too far ahead,\" added the chief executive. \"What we have to is address the issues we are facing. \"We have all the ingredients here to be successful. We need to stick together on and off the field and hopefully get a break here and there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
