Kate Winslet does her best, but there\u2019s nothing she can do with this unbearable and unbearably long movie. She plays Myrtle Dunnage, returning to her dusty Australian hometown in the early 1950s: she is a fashionista, a dressmaker with experience of Paris and Milan: haughty, glorious and glamorous, carrying her Singer sewing machine like a gunfighter with his pistol. It seems the mean-minded, petty population drove her out of town when she was just a kid, for reasons finally and tiresomely revealed in flashback. So now she has a score to settle with one and all, including her cantankerous old mum (Judy Davis) and nasty schoolteacher (Kerry Fox) \u2013 but she also finds sympathy from fashion-conscious police officer Sergeant Barrat (Hugo Weaving) and gorgeous semi-clothed neighbour Teddy (Liam Hemsworth). The film\u2019s flower of awfulness only properly blooms when it becomes clear that Myrtle\u2019s dressmaking creations can improve everyone\u2019s lives and liberate them from stilted narrow moralism \u2013 like Juliette Binoche\u2019s coy confectionery in a similar, if French, smalltown in Chocolat (2000). The final shift of mood is horribly jarring and unconvincing, and doesn\u2019t even end the film, which drags on to the two-hour mark. Surely Winslet can find better roles than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
