The party put its most popular asset, prime minister Jacinda Ardern, front and centre at the weekend gathering, which also saw the election of a new, female president, as it moved to address claims it has mishandled internal sexual assault complaints. Speaking to a rapturous crowd in the North Island city of Whanganui on Sunday, Ardern said the first tranche of the new funding would be spent on the country\u2019s state-funded schools \u2013 a total of $400m \u2013 which she said would improve education and create jobs. \u201cIn the world we live in, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a community where the school doesn\u2019t sit in the centre,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter where you are in New Zealand, there will be a school, doing its best to give our children the very best start, supporting the local community, acting like a hub.\u201d The infrastructure funds \u2013 which were teased on Saturday by Grant Robertson, the finance minister, with most details still to be announced \u2013 were an outstretched hand to the centre-left government\u2019s doubters in the corporate world, analysts said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the number one call from the business community, from economic commentators, from a lot of social services as well,\u201d said said Ben Thomas \u2013 a former press secretary for the previous centre-right National government \u2013 of Labour\u2019s decision to ease its borrowing rules for infrastructure. \u201cThat will allay a lot of the criticism of the business community, where business confidence has been an ongoing thorn in the side of the government for the last two years.\u201d David Cormack, a former head of policy and communications for the left-leaning Green party, said the decision to focus first on schools was clever and \u201ctactically well done\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s something that goes all around the country, in every town, and something where you can see material change occurring when schools start seeing their infrastructure improved,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t hurt that a lot of schools will start seeing them completed just as the election rolls around.\u201d Ardern\u2019s speech was full of her trademark calls to empathy, and attempted to delineate New Zealand\u2019s politics from those of more fractured nations elsewhere. \u201cPolitics at times no longer feels like a place for debate and dialogue, but a place for dissent and distrust,\u201d Ardern said, of other countries. \u201cWe\u2019re special because here we still debate. We still question. We still challenge our perspectives and views. But in amongst all of that, New Zealanders still expect something of politics, of government, of us.\u201d That Ardern was the conference\u2019s star was inescapable; political reporters from Stuff noted that 13 photos of the prime minister featured in the conference booklet with no other lawmakers pictured on their own. The prime minister was the party\u2019s \u201cstrongest asset\u201d and they were right to capitalise on that, analysts said. While Labour and the main opposition party, National, are close in the polls \u2013 with neither party capturing enough support to govern without the support of minor parties, according to recent figures \u2013 Ardern\u2019s popularity far outstrips that of any other politician, Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the prime minister is not only Labour\u2019s chief asset but possibly Labour\u2019s only significant asset,\u201d he said, noting Ardern\u2019s \u201coutstanding communication and personal skills\u201d. \u201cBut the government as a whole has failed to deliver on very significant promises, in particular housing, mental health, and tax reform,\u201d he said, adding that its ambitious housing policies, in particular, had been \u201ca disaster\u201d. The other matter anticipated ahead of the conference was the party\u2019s response to claims about how it has dealt with internal misconduct allegations. The party\u2019s former president Nigel Haworth resigned in September after claims he had mishandled sexual assault complaints against a party staffer. On Saturday, a new president, Claire Szabo \u2013 who is the chief executive of volunteer organisation Habitat for Humanity New Zealand \u2013 was voted in. Cormack praised the party for dealing with the matter at the start of the event. \u201cYou can\u2019t really announce anything positive when you\u2019ve got this big, negative, murky cloud hanging over you,\u201d he said. Two investigations into the sexual assault allegations are in progress. Szabo told reporters at the conference she would \u201cwork through\u201d the reports when they were finished before deciding what should be done. But Ardern\u2019s main message to the party was her plan \u201csimply to keep going\u201d, she said as she outlined her list of Labour\u2019s achievements to date. \u201cLet\u2019s keep doing this,\u201d she said, was the party\u2019s slogan heading into the next election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
