City welcome a rejuvenated Chelsea to the Etihad Stadium, in a game that could see Carlos Tevez included in the matchday squad for the first time in six months. And, despite trailing neighbours United by four points, Mancini is confident that City have what it takes to end a title drought that stretches back to 1968. \"We will win the title \u2013 or we will do everything we can to win the title,\" Mancini said, though he admitted time is running out. \"Ten games is nothing. We can't think about this, we need to think positive always. Until now we have had a fantastic Premier League campaign and we need to continue like this.\" City, who have a game in hand on United, may have to play Chelsea without their first-choice central defenders Vincent Kompany and Joleon Lescott, a scenario the manager admitted could be a \"big problem\". But it has not dampened his optimism about the chances of stealing the title from Old Trafford. \"I am confident because the players are very strong and they know we have a big chance to win this title,\" he said. \"I also think we deserve this after being top for seven months. We were top until one week ago, so we don't want to lose this chance to win. It changes nothing to be one point behind at this moment, because we have another 10 games, including a derby [at home to United on 30 April]. We have everything in our hands.\" United do not play again until Monday when they face Fulham at Old Trafford. Before, City travel to Stoke City so Mancini is conscious that Sir Alex Ferguson's men could again go behind in the title race. \"If we win our next two games, we go two points up,\" Mancini said. \"We need to go our way and can't think about United. I think we can do this \u2013 we did it when we started the season, in the first 10 games we won nine and drew one, away against Fulham.\" Mancini said the players need to win the title for the supporters. \"They need to win it for them, not for me. And for the club. For the same reasons, I want to win this championship.\" The Tevez situation has settled following his falling-out with Mancini and subsequent six-month absence after refusing to warm up during the Champions League game at Bayern Munich in September. This follows Tevez apologising to the manager last month after the player had refused to do so during the meeting at Mancini's house in October when the two men met alone and spoke in English to try to settle the matter. Tevez is unsure what reception he will receive from supporters on Wednesday, although Mancini has urged the fans to get behind the striker. \"What happened with Carlos was in the past. For the last month he has been part of our plans and for the next two months he will be a City player.\" He is also confident there will be no repeat of Tevez's behaviour. \"Carlos wants to play football after six months \u2013 for his future, he needs to play football again. I can say that in training, he has been perfect and better than last year. He wants to play and help the team and his attitude is better,\" he said. Mancini is excited to have Tevez back in his first-team plans. \"Yes, because I have always thought that Carlos is a top player \u2013 even when we had a problem. He is getting better but I don't think he can have more than 25 to 30 minutes because after this moment a player like Carlos needs to play, but not for 90 minutes. If he plays 30 minutes or 45 minutes for three or four games, maybe in two weeks he can have 90 minutes. We will decide today whether he is on the bench, because we want to know the situation with the players, but there is a possibility.\" While Lescott is definitely unavailable Kompany's hip problem has his manager rating his prospects as only \"40%\". Chelsea have won all four matches since sacking their manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, and replacing him with his assistant Roberto Di Matteo and Mancini admitted that the possibility of facing them without his best two central defenders is a daunting prospect. \"It could be a big problem,\" the manager said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
