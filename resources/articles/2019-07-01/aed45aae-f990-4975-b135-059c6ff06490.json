Mihajlovic said that the illness was discovered in tests carried out shortly before pre-season training began. Rumours about his health had spread over the past days after he did not join his team on a retreat to the Dolomites in northeastern Italy. \u201cWhen they told me, it was a huge shock. I spent two days in my room crying ... they are not tears of fear, I know I will win. I always play to win, both in football and in life,\u201d an emotional Mihajlovic said. \u201cIt\u2019s a treatable form, you can recover. And I will defeat it.\u201d The former Serbian international also revealed that he undergoes regular tests because his father died of cancer, and that doctors informed him he may not have noticed any symptoms for another year. Bologna\u2019s general manager, Walter Sabatini, said that Mihajlovic would remain the team\u2019s coach \u201cwhatever happens in the coming days\u201d, while the team doctor, Gianni Nanni, said the 50-year-old has \u201cacute leukaemia\u201d and will start treatment on Tuesday. The Bologna captain, Blerem Dzemaili, has said the playing squad will give their full support to their coach. \u201cWe know what kind of person [Sinisa] is, how strong he is and we\u2019ll try to transmit our strength to him too. He is like a father to us, so we\u2019ll fight for him the way he fights for us.\u201d Roberto Mancini, a former teammate of Mihajlovic, sent the Serb a positive message on Instagram, writing \u201cyou\u2019re too strong, this won\u2019t scare you\u201d. Bologna\u2019s first-team players, still away in the Dolomites, watched Mihajlovic\u2019s press conference gathered around a tablet during training. Mihajlovic replaced Filippo Inzaghi as Bologna coach in January, steering them from the relegation zone to a 10th-place finish in his second spell at the Serie A club. He has also coached the Serbian national team as well as Catania, Fiorentina, Sampdoria, Milan and Torino in Italy, and a brief stint with Sporting in Portugal. In his playing career as a full-back, Mihajlovic won the European Cup with Red Star Belgrade, the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with Lazio, two Serie A titles and four Italian cups. Known for his powerful free-kicks, Mihajlovic was capped for Serbia as well as the former Yugoslavia. He is perhaps best remembered in the UK for a racism row with Patrick Vieira, who accused Mihajlovic of calling him a \u201cmonkey\u201d during a Champions League tie between Arsenal and Lazio in 2000. Mihajlovic later apologised to Vieira, and the pair later became teammates at Internazionale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
