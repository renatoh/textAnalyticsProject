The EDF Energy Cup may not rank as the game's ultimate prize, but the painful spanking administered by the Cardiff Blues to an outclassed Gloucester was one of the more significant displays of the season. When Ian McGeechan unveils his squad tomorrow, the Blues' director of rugby, Dai Young, believes five of his players will be included. Some eye-catching displays on the eve of previous Lions tours have proved misleading in the long run, but this felt different. McGeechan and his fellow coaches can safely ink in the names of Martyn Williams, Gethin Jenkins and Tom Shanklin while Jamie Roberts and Leigh Halfpenny stand a decent chance of joining them. Too bad that Xavier Rush and Ben Blair are both capped All Blacks, otherwise they would be boarding the plane too. When a team plays with this much zest, physicality, know-how and collective trust, it makes even the non-playing substitutes look good. Assuming Jenkins, at loosehead prop, is probably the first name on the Lions' Test team-sheet, regardless of who gets the captaincy, Williams should not be far behind. If the Lions can get on the front foot, there is no better link man in Europe, as the Cherry and Whites were forcibly reminded. You will not see a classier scoring pass this year than the one Williams threw to Halfpenny to set up the 20-year-old winger's second try when everyone, including the defence, expected him to look inside. That kind of awareness and skill is not an everyday occurrence. \"He's not always brilliant but I've never seen him play poorly,\" said Young. It was not necessary to be Welsh to wonder if those predicting a heavy series defeat to the Springboks are not being slightly premature. There is no question the Lions will travel south with some quality players from teams playing outstanding rugby under the version of the laws that will pertain on tour. What more could McGeechan ask? Not much, according to Young, once a Lions Test prop himself: \"Shanks, Martin and Gethin are dead certs, Jamie Roberts is putting his hand up and Leigh Halfpenny has got to be there or thereabouts. I think it's a reward for what the players have done this season, not just for us but for Wales as well. I just can't see them not being there. They want to go down there and win, don't they?\" It was also a reminder that rugby is a simple game when played well: win the collisions, create holes, attack space and support the man with the ball. The Blues were humming even before the scrum-half Richie Rees, summoned from the bench after Jason Spice broke an arm, provided the deft flick that put Halfpenny away for his first score. This, self-evidently, is a team who know what they are trying to do and the video will provide much food for thought for Leicester, their Heineken Cup semi-final opponents on Sunday week. Despite Williams' caution \u2013 \"We know it'll be a different ball game ... they'll know exactly what to do to stop us playing\" \u2013 the Blues seem to be developing a big match temperament at just the right time. Nor are they satisfied with one trophy. \"The Leicesters and the Toulouses are never happy when they've won one thing,\" said Williams. \"They always want to better themselves.\" Nor can the Blues regard themselves as the finished article when they are not yet assured of automatic qualification for next year's Heineken Cup via the Magners League. \"We've got five games left and sitting where we are at the moment we're in a play-off,\" said Young. His problems, however, pale into insignificance next to Gloucester's. Their head coach, Dean Ryan, was his usual honest self afterwards but the script is now wearily familiar. \"This group is not good enough to compete at this level,\" he said, sifting through the wreckage of yet another sunny Twickenham burial. \"Cardiff were excellent and significantly better than us, there's no hiding from that. If we want a Gloucester side to compete we have to address that in recruitment because this group cannot keep coming back. We'll look at taking the club in a different direction with a different group of people next year. If [owner] Tom Walkinshaw sees that change as incorporating me, that'll come from him.\" Among those counting down their days at Kingsholm are Anthony Allen, Olly Barkley, Ryan Lamb, Gareth Cooper and Marco Bortolami, while the Blues outside-half Nicky Robinson must wonder whether crossing the Severn Bridge this summer is the wisest of career moves. There can be no licking of wounds, however, as Gloucester now face two games in five days to determine whether they make the Premiership play-offs. Neither Mike Tindall nor Iain Balshaw will be available against Worcester tomorrow, forcing Ryan to rely on the same demoralised troops. \"You can't play winning rugby when you're going backwards,\" said the skipper, Gareth Delve.
