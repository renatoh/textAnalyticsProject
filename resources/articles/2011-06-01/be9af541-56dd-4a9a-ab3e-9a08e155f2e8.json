On Monday's Channel 4 News, the Fifa president's press conference was given top billing over Colonel Gaddafi, who was being visited by Jacob Zuma. (Whether the South African president can be persuaded to extend his diplomatic mission to Zurich is hard to say. The suspicion is that Zuma wouldn't be allowed through security at Fifa House, his country having outlived its usefulness to the organisation with last year's World Cup.) Blatter has yet to address the cameras out of a car window holding an umbrella. But give it time. Even now, his posturing will feel oddly familiar to a news audience fast becoming accustomed to the spectacle of besieged dictators appearing before the cameras in a show of defiance. There was the absolute denial of wrongdoing, concluded after a rigorous 30-second investigation. There was the requisite mad dictator's waffle: \"All the little devils can enter this game, and we have to fight against these devils ... \" There was the pious vanity \u2013 \"elegance is an attitude \u2026 I have learned this in my life\" \u2013 and there were the lukewarm, expedient claims to be \"listening\" to critics, delivered alongside significantly more robust orders to foreign governments to stay out of his jurisdiction's affairs. \"If governments try to intervene then something is wrong,\" he warned. \"Fifa is strong enough that we can deal with our problems inside Fifa.\" Then, of course, there was Wednesday's election, in which Blatter swept to victory against himself. (Incidentally, in his new book on political order, Francis Fukuyama observes that liberal democracy has become so prestigious that even most authoritarians feel obliged to pretend to have elections.) Above all, there was Blatter's overarching appeal to what we might call patriotism, given that Fifa effectively operates as a state without borders. Villains of the Arab Spring have routinely blamed rebellion against their authority on external forces, and insisted the populace unite against this imagined enemy. And so with Blatter, who lards his statements with endless references to the \"Fifa family\", which is apparently the solution as opposed to part of the problem. To suggest the Fifa family makes the Addamses look like the Waltons does not begin to cover it. This is a level of tribal dysfunction that would throw the more unhinged of New York's five families into sympathetic relief. However, not only is Fifa exempt from the scrutiny of international election observers, but it is fortunate enough to be physically located where other tinpot dictators can only squirrel their money: Switzerland. Asking what attracts Fifa to hyper-secretive Swiss law has the flavour of Mrs Merton's famous inquiry of Debbie McGee concerning her millionaire husband Paul Daniels. Fifa is a secrecy jurisdiction within a secrecy jurisdiction \u2013 a powerful political entity which repeatedly coerces other states into overriding their own constitutions and tax laws, yet remains entirely unaccountable for the manner in which it operates. \"Any host country requires a comprehensive tax exemption to be given to Fifa and further parties involved in the hosting and staging of an event,\" runs a typically shameless official statement on the World Cup. (I think we can all live without Fifa's tax-avoiding sponsors attempting to take the moral high ground this week.) Never forget that tax avoidance is a profoundly political act. As the tax campaigner Richard Murphy explains, secrecy jurisdictions \"deliberately ensure that what little wealth the poorest of the world might be entitled to in the world's developing countries is systematically transferred to the world's wealthiest countries for the benefit of the wealthiest in those wealthiest countries\". Strip away the guff about \"our family\", and isn't this Fifa's business model? World football's governing body does not promote universal wellbeing, as we might expect of other organisations accorded this special status within Swiss law, such as the Red Cross. Instead of being about the dispersal of wealth and power, as it would have us believe, Fifa is instead concerned with its concentration in the hands of an elite. That Fifa should still have nations fighting to stage World Cups, when all the evidence indicates that the house always wins at the expense of the hosts, is among the greatest conjuring tricks of the age. So on the form book, I'm afraid, you wouldn't bet against Blatter outlasting any number of other vulnerable-looking autocrats, and the Football Spring proving nothing but a false dawn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
