The son of an Anglican priest, Stephen had his first gay experiences in London in his mid-teens, but it was when he went to Edinburgh University, where he studied Divinity, that he formed his identity as a gay man. He was strongly drawn to left politics, liberation theology and sexual politics, and became, for a time, a member of the student branch of the Communist party of Great Britain (CPGB). Involved in the lesbian and gay movement throughout the 1980s, Stephen was one of the organisers of a lesbian and gay socialist conference in Edinburgh in 1984, and was active in supporting the miners' strike. Stephen was never hidebound, and was unfazed by finding himself in a relationship with me, although many friends were startled by his bisexuality. We worked jointly as volunteer books and features editors for Gay Scotland magazine, were instrumental in starting the Edinburgh Bisexual Group, and created a number of flamboyant political banners, his favourite of which was \"Pinko Commie Queers\", the banner of the CPGB Lesbian and Gay Network, fashioned from pink net. Stephen's first paid job was as a part-time administrator for Gay Scotland, and he later moved to the HR department at Napier University in Edinburgh. However, just as his career looked promising, he was struck down by viral cardiomyopathy and had a heart transplant in 1998. The anti-rejection drugs caused a series of other major health problems, including osteoporosis, kidney failure and cancer, but Stephen was grateful for the additional time the transplant gave him. When he was obliged to give up work, he enjoyed the opportunity to further indulge his great passions for classical music and reading. In recent years he returned to religion, attending Old St Paul's Church in Edinburgh when he could. He loved travel and returned from trips to Granada, Cordoba, Venice, Sicily and Rome with an encyclopedic knowledge of their history and architecture. \u2022 Stephen is survived by his partner of 22 years, Adam O'Brien."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
