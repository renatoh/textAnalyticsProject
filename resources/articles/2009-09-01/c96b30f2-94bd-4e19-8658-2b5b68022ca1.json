The England Seniors team at the world championships in Sao Paolo went one better \u2013 they were there despite not qualifying. But the withdrawal of the Netherlands allowed them in as first reserves, and they dominated the round robin phase. They got to choose their quarter-final opponents, selected Egypt and needed to pick up a swing on the penultimate board to win by a single IMP. A win over Indonesia in the semi-final carried them to their destiny. They lost the first session against a very strong Polish side by 59 IMPs to 1. Ross Harper, the England captain, led the comeback on today's deal, which shows that pre-empts don't always work. Love all, dealer West: The Polish North-South pair reached the sound contract of five of clubs, and declarer came to 12 tricks. England sat North-South with this bidding: In the normal run of events, six of clubs was likely to fail, but guided by East's show of weakness and length in diamonds, Harper easily brought home the contract. West led a diamond to the ace, and East continued the suit. Winning with the king, declarer led a spade to dummy's queen and ruffed a spade in his hand. A club to the jack was followed by another spade ruff, and Harper drew two more rounds of trumps with the king and ace. Dummy's spades were all good now, and England picked up 11 IMPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
