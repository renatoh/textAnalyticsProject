One of Gordon Brown's inventions, the chancellor introduced it as a stepping stone between the full budgets given each spring. The statement provides a progress report on what has been achieved so far and gives an update on the state of the economy and the government finances. It also sets out the direction of government policy in the run-up to the traditional spring budget. How does it differ from the budget? The Treasury's intention was that the pre-budget report would be an informal announcement of the long-term things the government planned to do, rather than a specific set of formal policy announcements - leaving that task to the budget. In his first report to the Commons, the chancellor went out of his way to explain that he wanted to hear people disagree with his suggestions. \"My aim,\" he said, \"is to begin a national debate on the major economic issues we face.\" Did it work out like that? Not really. In recent years, the pre-budget report has come to be seen as a second budget, rather than a broad-brush analysis of long-term economic planning. The chancellor has increasingly used it to launch eye-catching policy initiatives and ditch unpopular policies. The minimum income guarantee for pensioners, fuel duty cuts and 10p starting rate of income tax were all unveiled in pre-budget reports. Why can't the chancellor return to his original plans? Partly because the media treat all the chancellor's announcements as firm policy proposals, meaning he has to take care in the report not to stray from the government's established economic agenda. There is little room for the broad-brush discussion that the chancellor had hoped to achieve. What is the \"golden rule\"? The \"golden rule\" - which Labour promised to keep on its pre-election pledge card in 1997 - states that, over an economic cycle, the government must only borrow to invest - in other words, it must meet all its running costs, such as public sector salaries, through taxation. Is Mr Brown sticking to his golden rule? The chancellor insists he is on target. But he has come under increasing pressure from critics - most recently the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - who claim that a black hole in his budget forecasts will force him to breach his self-imposed rule of balancing spending across the economic cycle. Mr Brown argues that the state coffers remain healthy enough to avoid higher taxes or having to rein back public spending. What's expected in the tomorrow's report? The statement is expected to feature measures to boost enterprise, science and education, and help motorists in an upbeat package designed to create a \"feelgood factor\" ahead of the general election. Isn't the chancellor keen to help families with children? The chancellor, a father himself, is certainly keen to push his family-friendly credentials. He - or children's minister Margaret Hodge - is expected to announce that extended maternity leave could be shared between mother and father, in order to allow new dads up to three months with their children in their first year of life. The scheme, part of a package of improvements to childcare provision, is expected to meet resistance from employers. What about drivers? Motorists are expecting good news, with widespread reports that the chancellor will announce he is scrapping a mooted 1.92p-a-litre fuel price rise for 2004-05. The increase was postponed earlier in the year because of concern over soaring oil prices. Forgoing it altogether will cost the Treasury \u00a3750m, but may be an astute pre-election measure aimed at shoring up Labour's middle England vote. Any other major policies? Perhaps with one eye on the potential windfall he is losing out on by scrapping the fuel tax increase, Mr Brown is expected to launch a clampdown on corporate tax avoidance schemes in an effort to improve the tax take."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
