He was a film star, gifted, gorgeous, chiselled from top to bottom. Box office gold. There seemed to be no genre he couldn\u2019t star in: thrillers (detective Thomas Flanigan in King of New York), action movies (drug baron Nino Brown in New Jack City), sports comedies (basketball hustler Syd Deane in White Men Can\u2019t Jump), LGBT comedies (drag queen Noxeema Jackson in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar), arthouse romances (commercials director Max Carlyle in One Night Stand) and dramas (architect Flipper Purify in Jungle Fever). In 2004, his salary was a reported $13m for producing and starring in the third Blade blockbuster, Blade: Trinity. Snipes could not have been flying much higher. And then he fell. Boy, did he fall. First came the stories that he was difficult to work with. Then nearly all his films started going straight to DVD. In 2008, he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $5m for wilful failure to file $15m worth of federal income tax returns. Snipes lost his appeal against conviction and in December 2010 he was jailed. After serving two and a half years, he was released in 2013. Snipes, 58, is sitting in a recording studio when we Zoom. With his deep velvet voice he sounds like the world\u2019s smoothest jazz DJ. He looks the part, too \u2013 turquoise turtleneck, green cap, headphones and a long chain he says is a \u201cQuantum Receptor \u2026 but that\u2019s a bit too heavy for this conversation\u201d. Behind him is a sign that reads \u201cDaywalker Klique\u201d. I ask what that is. \u201cThe Daywalker Klique is a global community of multi-talented hyphenates, skill masters, adept at doing more than one thing extremely well on a mission to bring light to the world of darkness,\u201d he replies. Snipes tells me he is a founder member. My head is spinning already. Could he be more specific? \u201cFor instance, you might have someone who by day is a senator and by night is a rock\u2019n\u2019roll guitar player. And you might have somebody who by day is a nuclear physicist and by night is a professional karaoke artist.\u201d And they have such members? \u201cWe do!\u201d Can he give me names? \u201cNooooo!\u201d Snipes has never been backward in coming forward. He\u2019s quick to tell me about the ways in which he is a multi-talented hyphenate. \u201cI\u2019m a good thinker. I\u2019m an excellent student. I\u2019m a skilled dancer. I can sing. I can also write very well \u2013 I\u2019m an author. I can do graffiti. I can cook very well. People are less familiar with my forays into technology and telecommunications.\u201d And he has not even mentioned the acting or his fifth dan black belt in Shotokan karate. Snipes has not done many interviews since his release from prison. There has been no need; he hasn\u2019t had much to promote. Some old friends stood by him: Spike Lee cast him in his 2015 film Chi-Raq, an adaptation of the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata, and Sylvester Stallone hired him for The Expendables 3, playing a character newly released from jail after being banged up for tax evasion. But now it looks as if he really is on his way back. Last year he starred with Eddie Murphy in the successful comedy Dolemite Is My Name, about the blaxploitation pioneer Rudy Ray Moore. Next he is appearing in Coming 2 America, the long-awaited sequel to the 1988 monster hit Coming to America, which again stars Murphy. He says we\u2019re going to love it, and suddenly he\u2019s in character, telling me that he plays General Izzi, the brother of the woman Eddie Murphy\u2019s Prince Akeem left at the altar in the original. \u201cI have been vexed about it ever since. Sooooooh I think there\u2019s going to be a probleeem. We can do it hard or we can do it easeeeeey!\u201d I drag him back to the real world. How does he think his conviction affected his career? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get that perspective from those in the business who were the gatekeepers. As far as the streets were concerned, it didn\u2019t change their appreciation for my work and my artistry one bit. Not one bit.\u201d Was he offered big roles after his release? \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he says uncertainly. \u201cI\u2019ve been offered some great roles. I haven\u2019t done another project with Marvel, but working with Eddie Murphy was a phenomenal opportunity for me.\u201d Snipes grew up in the Bronx and attended New York\u2019s School of the Performing Arts \u2013 the \u201cFame\u201d school \u2013 where he studied dance, singing and acting. When he was 15, his mother moved them back to Florida, where he was born. He went on to study drama at the State University of New York. In one of his first interviews, in 1991, he talked about being arrested and falsely accused of stealing a car \u2013 when he protested, one of the police officers kneed him in the neck. I say that when I read this recently, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of George Floyd. He nods, and suddenly he\u2019s back in 1991. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the knee to the neck, I had a gun put to my head. They did what was standard protocol in those days in Los Angeles. There was supposedly a robbery in the area and the police saw the red Mustang and the black guy driving, and it was: \u2018Get out of the car, get on the ground. You move and I\u2019ll shoot you in the heeeead.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first time it happened to me.\u201d In 2007, when he was facing a maximum 16 years in prison for the more serious charges of tax fraud and conspiracy \u2013 of which he was later cleared \u2013 Snipes\u2019 lawyers claimed he would be unable to get a fair trial in Ocala, Florida, because of its pervasive racism. They pointed out that Snipes had never lived in the city (he lived in Orlando, 80 miles away, but prosecutors claimed more of the alleged crimes took place in Ocada), that statues of the founder of the Ku Klux Klan had been erected there and that it was a \u201chotbed of Klan activity\u201d. Snipes was accused of playing the race card. Meanwhile, last month the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump had paid no federal income tax in 11 of the 18 years its reporters investigated. Trump has never been charged with any crime, let alone convicted. Why does he think Trump got away without paying and he didn\u2019t? \u201cWell, that\u2019s an easy answer. He\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d But he got away with it when he wasn\u2019t president. \u201cThis is not rocket science. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d He starts talking about his case. \u201cThe law says you pay for people who are experts to manage your business affairs, yet I was included as a co-conspirator with the lawyer and the accountants. Now this is rare. Very unusual situation.\u201d Was it a miscarriage of justice? \u201cAbsolutely. Of course it was unfair.\u201d Snipes objects to the word prison, insisting on calling it \u201ccamp\u201d \u2013 in other words, a minimum security prison. \u201cThe biggest thing I got from it was learning the value of time and how we often squander it ... I understand that very clearly now, having been away from my family and loved ones two and a half years.\u201d Snipes has five children \u2013 the eldest is 32, the youngest 13; four of them are from his second marriage, to the South Korean artist Nakyung Park. Did it make him reassess himself? Did he think he had been wrong and stupid? \u201cAll of the above.\u201d He still believes he shouldn\u2019t have been convicted, but he says he\u2019s not entirely blameless. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an innocent bystander in any of it. I made decisions. I accept the ramifications of those decisions. No one forced me to take that person as my accountant; no one forced me to take that person as my lawyer. No one forced me to believe what they were saying. That was on me. I don\u2019t have time to sit back and say I was wronged and recapture all that was lost.\u201d Anyway, he says, he wouldn\u2019t want to do that. Snipes believes that overall it has been a positive experience. \u201cI\u2019ve gained so much more. I understand so much more. And if two and a half years of my life were in meditation and isolation up at that camp out of the 100 I plan on living, good deal. Goood deal!\u201d Did he come out a better person? \u201cI hope I came out a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cI came out a clearer person. Clearer on my values, clearer on my purpose, clearer about my relationship with my ancestors and the great god and the great goddess above, and clearer on what I was going to do once I had my freedom back.\u201d I ask whether he had become greedy. \u201cGreedy?\u201d He sounds puzzled by the word, and chews it over. \u201cI, errrrm, don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t focus on making money \u2026 You don\u2019t see pictures of me wearing all the big chains and driving all the big fancy cars.\u201d That\u2019s interesting, I say, because in many of your movies you do all of those things. \u201cYes and I didn\u2019t want that persona to carry with me when I was off screen. I enjoyed being able to move through the community and environments without people knowing I was there.\u201d As so often with Snipes, he thinks on the subject, and adjusts his answer a moment later. Actually, he says, he did go through a period of playing the Big I Am. \u201cI had the 200lb bodyguards, and all that stuff draws attention to you.\u201d Did he need the bodyguards or was he just trying to impress? \u201cWhen I started doing film, there wasn\u2019t a school that taught artists how to deal with their success. You learned things by trial and error. You might say: \u2018Well, this used to be the bodyguard for Muhammad Ali or Larry Flynt, and these cats are the baddest of the bad.\u2019 You rock with that, because there\u2019s nobody there to tell you otherwise. If you\u2019re lucky you recognise that having this guy is a waste of time; he\u2019s too big to sit in the plane seat so it\u2019s going to cost me two tickets and when it\u2019s time, he can\u2019t even run. OK, plan B. No more of the big bodyguards, we\u2019re done with that.\u201d I ask if I can read him a quote about his behaviour on the set of Blade: Trinity to see if he thinks it is fair. \u201cYes, yes, yes, which one is this?\u201d It\u2019s from the actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, I say. \u201cA reliable authority on me,\u201d he replies sarcastically. I read the quote: \u201cWesley was just fucking crazy in a hilarious way \u2026 he tried to strangle [director] David Goyer.\u201d \u201cLet me tell you one thing. If I had tried to strangle David Goyer, you probably wouldn\u2019t be talking to me now. A black guy with muscles strangling the director of a movie is going to jail, I guarantee you.\u201d So that\u2019s a no, then? \u201cDid I go to jail for strangling him? Never happened.\u201d I continue with the quote. \u201cFor the rest of the production he would only communicate through Post-it notes. And he would sign each Post-it note \u2018From Blade\u2019.\u201d True or not? \u201cHehehe!\u201d He starts giggling, but he\u2019s not amused. \u201cOnce again, Mr Oswalt is the authority. Hohoho! Why do people believe this guy\u2019s version of this story? Answer me that.\u201d I\u2019m not saying I believe it, I say. I\u2019m simply asking if you think it\u2019s fair. Now his voice is calm and professorial. \u201cThis is part of the challenges that we as African Americans face here in America \u2013 these microaggressions. The presumption that one white guy can make a statement and that statement stands as true! Why would people believe his version is true? Because they are predisposed to believing the black guy is always the problem. And all it takes is one person, Mr Oswalt, who I really don\u2019t know. I can barely remember him on the set, but it\u2019s fascinating that his statement alone was enough to make people go: \u2018Yeah, you know Snipes has got a problem.\u2019\u201d And still he\u2019s not done. \u201cI remind you that I was one of the executive producers of the project,\u201d he says. \u201cI had contractual director approval. I was not just the actor for hire. I had au-thor-i-ty to say, to dictate, to decide. This was a hard concept for a lot of people to wrap their heads around.\u201d The problem is, Snipes says, that Hollywood is still run by white people for white people. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a white guy to go out and write the experience of a black guy growing up in the Bronx the way I grew up. How is he going to know that?\u201d And that\u2019s why he says black artists should follow the example of film-makers in, for example, South Korea or Nigeria. \u201cThe South Koreans are not sitting there complaining about not being included in Hollywood. They went and built their own. The Nigerians are not waiting for Hollywood to come along; they\u2019ve got the third largest industry in the world.\u201d It is 33 years since Snipes got his first break in the video of Michael Jackson\u2019s Bad, directed by Martin Scorsese. The storyline has Jackson as a gangster facing off against Snipes. What was Jackson like? \u201cTo me he was very gentle. He was funny. Michael asked me to teach him how to be a tough guy. \u2018Teach me how to be hard,\u2019\u201d he squeaks \u00e0 la Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m like, Mike, come on, you do what you do. I do what I do.\u201d Was he surprised when Jackson was charged with child sex abuse? \u201cYeah.\u201d He pauses. \u201cQuite. Quite.\u201d Did he believe Jackson, who was ultimately acquitted, was guilty? \u201cNo. No. I didn\u2019t.\u201d Another pause. \u201cBy choice. You know, Michael Jackson\u2019s contribution to the world is irrefutable, immutable, undeniable, indelible. So I choose to believe whatever was going on in his private life that I don\u2019t know about is between him and his creator. Based on my experience with the man, I choose to believe in and focus on his magical contribution to the world.\u201d Is that because he wants to believe in him? \u201cSure. Absolutely. I have a saying: I reject your reality and assert my own.\u201d Indeed, there are times when it\u2019s hard to distinguish between objective reality and the reality Snipes asserts. He tells me about all the pioneering projects he is working on in science and technology, telecommunications, building new digital platforms, as well as all the film parts and his secret society bringing light to the world. Is he wealthy these days? \u201cIs that how you define wealth, by having a lot of money?\u201d he demands. Has he got a new accountant? Does he pay all his taxes? Now he\u2019s laughing. \u201cI pay all my taxes. I\u2019ve got new accountants, yeah, absolutely.\u201d He\u2019s still pondering the wealth question. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a conversation very soon and you\u2019ll say: \u2018Wesley, you didn\u2019t tell me you were planning on being a billionaire.\u2019 And I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m a billionaire, it matters what we do with it.\u2019 We\u2019ll have this conversation next year and you\u2019ll be like, holy shit, he wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d And with that, he\u2019s off to savour his freedom and assert his reality.
