Apple classics and their 1960s ancestors", "bodyText": "How do you like them Apples? Braun products designed by Dieter Rams (above) and Apple products designed by Jonathan Ive (below) 'As designers we have a great responsibility,\" says Dieter Rams, the veteran German industrial designer who made Braun a household name from the late 1950s with products from minimalist radios to record players, alarm clocks to electric shavers. \"I believe designers should eliminate the unnecessary,\" he says. \"That means eliminating everything that is modish because this kind of thing is only short-lived.\" Now, this could easily be Jonathan Ive speaking. The British-born designer of all those hugely successful Apple computers and digital electronic gizmos from iMac to iPod and iPhone has, in fact, shaped product after product in much the same spirit as his German predecessor. So much so that US websites (try gizmodo.com) have been increasingly alive with \"compare and contrast\" blogs showing just how closely a Braun T1000 radio (Rams) resembles Apple's Power Mac G5/Mac Pro (Ive), or how an Apple iMac (Ive) is pretty much a dead ringer for a Braun LE1 speaker (Rams). Before anyone gets the wrong idea, followed by writs from the mighty Apple Inc, no one is accusing Ive of copying Rams, although there is, quite clearly, a synergy between their work separated by several decades. Actually, Rams admires Apple, as he once did Sony, two corporations that have followed much the same design philosophy as Braun did from 1955 when Rams, then just 23 years old, joined its design team. Rams was head of design at Braun from 1961 until 1995; two years later, Ive was promoted to Apple's head of design; it was as if Rams' baton had been handed on to a younger talent, 45 years his junior, working for a different company in another country. Ive, though, is taking this shared credo into a world of computers that were in their infancy even at the height of Rams' distinguished career. Who knows where his quest for beautiful simplicity will go in the future? \"If I have seen further,\" admitted Sir Isaac Newton, \"it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Like Rams, Ive is a modest and self-effacing fellow; and they both qualify as giants in the design world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
