The 20-year-old Aston Villa forward missed this summer's European Championship in Holland after the Football Association was unable to contact him. Villa's manager, Martin O'Neill, initially took the blame for a breakdown in communications and Pearce visited Agbonlahor to discuss his international future. Agbonlahor could still have applied to play for Scotland or Nigeria but appears to have underlined his commitment to England. Theo Walcott is also included in the squad after missing the Holland tournament to recover from shoulder surgery. Everton's midfielder Lee Carsley has been left out of the Republic of Ireland squad for next week's friendly in Denmark. The manager, Steve Staunton, says the 33-year-old is still part of his plans but does not feel it necessary to include him for the fixture in Aarhus. Newcastle's Stephen Carr has been recalled after an absence of almost a year. France's coach, Raymond Domenech, confirmed yesterday that he faced a Uefa hearing over comments made in the French newspaper Le Parisien alluding to a referee being bought in an Under-21 match between France and Italy during the qualification campaign for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Uefa's president, Michel Platini, said Domenech should provide evidence or face sanctions. \"Uefa has asked for an inquiry,\" Domenech said yesterday. \"I'll go there willingly.\" The president of the French football federation, Jean-Pierre Escalettes, said Domenech's comments did not reflect the view of the federation. France visit Italy for a Euro 2008 qualifier on September 8 and Domenech told Le Parisien he had doubts about the refereeing of the match. \"I'm not the one who has invented the stories about refereeing in Italy,\" he said, in reference to the match-fixing scandal that broke last year.
