On Saturday another flawed performance ended a brief new year revival when they lost to a Tottenham side that had more guile, more gumption and a greater willingness to graft. Had the hands of Gary Doherty not been largely hidden from Uriah Rennie's view when the Spurs defender pawed at Michael Owen's attempt to play a return ball to Emile Heskey in the penultimate minute, Liverpool might have averted defeat with the second penalty of the match. \"Deliberate handball in the box is a penalty,\" said their manager G\u00e9rard Houllier, \"and that is where we could have got something out of the game.\" The decision would have been just, though not the result. In a stop-go season, which found them in the bottom three after Christmas following four successive defeats, Tottenham would be content to finish above halfway. Having won three league games in a row they may yet aim for something higher. David Pleat's caretakership continues to enhance the prospects of unsung but useful talent. With Gus Poyet suspended and Ledley King a last-minute casualty he drafted in Michael Brown, a former Manchester City midfielder signed from Sheffield United. Brown, 27 next Sunday, is no youthful prospect but his confident touches suggested a Premiership career is still not beyond him. With Darren Anderton he consistently denied Liverpool parity between the penalty areas, no mean achievement against Dietmar Hamann and Danny Murphy. Pleat clearly believes that gold still lurks in the grey outback of the Nationwide League. \"It is the way we are building,\" he said, \"and I wish more managers would give players like this a chance.\" Against Liverpool his view was vindicated by Anthony Gardner, once of Port Vale, who not only dominated Tottenham's defence but frequently brought the ball forward intelligently and had a part in each of Spurs' goals. The strength of Gardner's centre-back partnership with Doherty (ex-Luton Town) restricted Owen and Heskey to infrequent glimpses of a scoring opportunity. Owen's best chance came after four minutes when Heskey beat Doherty to a long high clearance and set the Liverpool striker up for the sort of sharp shot from which he usually scores. This time, however, Owen dragged the ball wide. Thereafter, Doherty's hands-on moment apart, the Tottenham pair experienced few problems keeping the England strikers at bay. \"Doherty and Gardner were fantastic,\" Pleat enthused. \"I told them that when they go to bed tonight they should think of each other.\" Certainly they were not going to lose sleep over Owen and Heskey. Not that the way Liverpool approached the game was ever likely to disturb the waking thoughts of their opponents; their defence creaked on its hinges. Still lacking Steven Gerrard's ability to turn defence into atack at the flick of a switch the midfield lumbered and laboured with the result that little of consequence came through to Owen and Heskey while Harry Kewell had to go walkabouts in search of possession. \"We used too many long balls to my taste,\" Houllier admitted afterwards. There is nothing wrong with a long ball if it has a precise purpose and achieves results. Each of Tottenham's goals was the consequence of a long pass intelligently executed. Midway through the first half a combination of Gardner's high lob forward and the timing of Robbie Keane's run sent Keane clear towards the left-hand byline. Biscan's ill-timed lunge then brought him down and his penalty had the power to beat Jones. Nine minutes into the second half Johnnie Jackson gathered a pass from Gardner and laid a long ball up to Helder Postiga, who evaded Biscan to drive in Spurs' second goal and his first in the Premiership. His growing confidence did much to offset losing Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9. Kewell's slickly taken goal 15 minutes from the end, allied to the entry of Steve Finnan and John Arne Riise that gave them more natural width, enabled Liverpool to finish with a flourish. But as Houllier said, somewhat ruefully: \"We don't have to wait until the end of the game to start playing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
