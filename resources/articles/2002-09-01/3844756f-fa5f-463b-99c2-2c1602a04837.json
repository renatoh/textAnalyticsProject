The World Cup semi-finalists were untroubled as Arif Erdem grabbed a brace after Serhat Akin gave Turkey a 14th-minute lead at the Ali Sami Yen stadium. \"It was not a hard match,\" Gunes said. \"We won with few problems and I am happy we started with an easy win. \"I was disappointed by Slovakia's performance. They played much better last year. They made many mistakes in defence and we took advantage of them. The first goal was very important - it was an easy match for us from that moment.\" The Slovakia coach Ladislav Jurkemik, whose inexperienced side face England next on October 12, was equally mystified by the dismal performance of his team. \"The match showed how easy it is to win when one team makes mistakes and the other passes the ball well, making the most of their chances,\" Jurkemik said. \"We made too many mistakes. Turkey are a very good team but we helped them win this match. We gave them the first and second goals as a present.\" Liechtenstein, the weakest team in Group Seven, scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw with Macedonia yesterday. Ralf Loose's side, who were thrashed 11-1 by Macedonia in a friendly two years ago, went behind to an eighth-minute goal from the former Barnsley striker Georgi Hristov but Michael Stocklasa struck late to earn an unlikely point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
