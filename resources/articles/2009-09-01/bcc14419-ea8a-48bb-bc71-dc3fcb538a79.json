Labour's record investment in education is rightly one of its proudest boasts and the opposition parties have been at pains to reassure the electorate that they would match it. Now the talk is about cuts and who will cut wisely. There is no optimistic spin to all this, but in these difficult times we do need to identify principles to guide the changes, so that the power of education to change lives is not fatally weakened. It is more than a decade since the education service had to manage a diminishing budget. A whole generation of teachers, school leaders, parents and pupils have had no experience of anything other than year-on-year increases. The government may be able to protect direct school budgets, but there is going to be far less money in the system, not only in schools but colleges and universities as well. It is not the best place to be, but it is worth reminding ourselves that many of the changes brought about by the investment of the last 12 years can't be taken away. Schools, colleges and universities have been rebuilt, early-years provision is in place, teachers are better trained, expectations of children are higher, and opportunities offered by the digital revolution have, at least in part, been embraced. Now we have a different set of choices, but we do have choices and we need to know how they are going to be made. We need to know what considerations are guiding politicians. I offer five principles for starters. First, there are always some savings to be made by identifying waste, but never enough. Political parties will need to be clear about the consequence of any cuts they propose \u2013 there are very few easy options. When extra money is announced, we're told what it is to be spent on and what it can be expected to achieve. We need that same openness if money is taken away. Second, proposals must be driven by education and not political considerations. What is politically acceptable doesn't always make for good education. Each of the parties, for example, will no doubt claim that they will protect frontline services, but what does that mean? Teachers are more effective if they are well supported and can focus on teaching. Take away clerical staff, school improvement support and technicians, and it has an impact on teaching and learning. Third, look at what the evidence tells us has made the most difference to the quality of education and preserve it at all costs. Early years, leadership training, professional development for teachers, teachers learning from each other \u2013 all would be on my list. Fourth, stand by the principle of devolved budgets. It is tempting for ministers to think it is easier to manage any budget reductions from the centre, but allowing schools to decide how to spend their money is still the right thing to do. Fifth, prepare for the upturn. The last decade has been one of huge change and real progress. There has been no shortage of pilots, pathways and gateways designed to test new initiatives. Now is the time to halt those that are not delivering and plan how the successful ones can benefit more people. Most of all, we mustn't lose our enthusiasm or our belief in the power of education to effect change. We've seen a significant shift in people's attitudes to education and learning during the lifetime of this government. The education system has higher expectations; more parents demand higher standards; more people want to go to university; there is less tolerance of underachievement, more appreciation of a broader curriculum. All this must survive the present difficulties if we are to make sure we maintain the momentum.
