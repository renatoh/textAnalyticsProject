That is the ambition for Harry Kane, who has barely stopped scoring since his remarkable breakthrough last year, as he approaches the final weeks of a campaign that ended in disappointment at Tottenham Hotspur but could yet finish with a summer to remember with England. Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose were not the ones who arrived at St George\u2019s Park this week with Premier League winner\u2019s medals. Leicester\u2019s players, not Tottenham\u2019s, had that honour and Kane was one of the first to congratulate Jamie Vardy and Danny Drinkwater on their season of seasons. It is the Spurs striker, though, who is expected to lead the line for England at the European Championship in France. This time last year Kane was in the Czech Republic with the under-21s after a stunning end-of-season run at Tottenham and, despite a brief period when the goals slowed up on his return, there have been few signs of personal fatigue, even though questions have been asked about Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s intense training regime and its effect on Spurs\u2019 last few performances. Kane rejected suggestions of heavy legs within the Tottenham contingent of Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad before Sunday\u2019s friendly with Turkey at the Etihad Stadium, coming before other England warm-up games against Australia and Portugal. Instead, Kane says, the squad is vibrant and fearless. \u201cFor a lot of us it\u2019s our first major tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real fear \u2013 we are not scared to play our football. Throughout the whole international year we\u2019ve been playing well, we\u2019ve been going out and trying to play good football, we\u2019ve been scoring goals, pressing high. That\u2019s what the manager wants us to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to do. \u201cThere\u2019s been some disappointments over the years but now we\u2019ve got a great young side, we\u2019re very excited about the tournament and we\u2019ve got no fear. We\u2019ll go out, play our football and express ourselves and see where that takes us.\u201d Asked about Pochettino\u2019s teams potentially tiring at the end of a season, Kane said: \u201cI don\u2019t really believe that. Obviously, we didn\u2019t get the performances we wanted in the last four or five weeks but we were still running, still pressing high but things probably just got in our way. \u201cWe put so much energy into fighting for the title and the race, maybe it might have had a little psychological effect but that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to get better at. I know the manager spoke about that \u2013 getting a better mentality. Hopefully it\u2019s something that we can learn from and get better at. \u201cBut we\u2019re all still feeling good. There\u2019s not been one complaint or anybody moaning that they were tired. We\u2019re here and we\u2019re excited to get going. I feel very good, I feel fit and ready to go. I\u2019ve kept myself in good shape, had a good recovery and I think that\u2019s important.\u201d Kane is one of five forwards Hodgson named in his provisional 26-man squad on Monday. Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Vardy were not surprise selections but it was the name of Marcus Rashford that caught the eye and Hodgson has challenged the young Manchester United striker to knock one of the established names \u201coff their perch\u201d and make the cut for the final 23 who will go to France. Rashford has made the most of his chance at United since being given his debut because of an injury in the warm-up to Anthony Martial before a Europa League game, and although Kane has yet to properly meet the 18-year-old, he is expecting fireworks when Rashford links up with the squad. \u201cHe\u2019s been outstanding,\u201d Kane said. \u201cFull credit to him, he deserves his place. He\u2019s young, he\u2019s come in and shown no fear of playing on the big stage and he\u2019s just expressed himself. He\u2019s not been fazed by playing in the Premier League and hopefully he can take that on to the international stage. We are looking forward to meeting him when he reports next week, seeing his ability. He\u2019s shown at the back end of the season that he can score goals and he\u2019s a real talent. \u201cObviously we [Tottenham] played against United a month or two ago now and shook his hand but I never really got into a conversation with him. But it will be good to meet him next week and see what he\u2019s like as a person, and as a player. If you\u2019re playing for England you\u2019re going to have threats for your position. We\u2019re all fighting for our position \u2013 no one is secure or a definite starter, so we go from now up to the Euros trying to cement our place.\u201d Kane believes England\u2019s performance in Germany two months ago, when Hodgson\u2019s team overturned a deficit to win 3-2, is evidence of their potential. Kane, who scored 25 goals in the Premier League in the season just finished, has proven himself at club level. Next up is a sterner examination. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d he said, when asked if he was targeting the Euro 2016 golden boot. \u201cThat\u2019s the aim, definitely. The more the merrier. The whole team are very excited. Now the season is over we\u2019re itching to get out there, to see what it\u2019s like and get going.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
