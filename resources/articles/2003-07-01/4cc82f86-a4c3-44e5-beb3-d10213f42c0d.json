There were a few chants of \"get on with it\", and even a slow handclap as the visitors batted on, and on, to the highest total in almost 100 first class matches at Stanley Park, finally declaring just before tea. Then, as the shadows lengthened, a series of lbw appeals against the Kent old boy Carl Hooper aroused further derision from the deckchairs, mainly because they were turned down. However, they can not have been far off, as the Kent bowlers sought to capitalise on the crazy-paving pitch's increasingly low bounce by bowling straight. Alec Swann had already gone lbw to a shooter from the young left-arm spinner Rob Ferley in the sixth over, and it will not get any easier, which makes Lancashire's target of 453 to avoid the follow-on a daunting one. That was the justification for Kent's steady progress from their overnight 384 for four, with Mark Ealham batting throughout the morning session to reach 95. Matthew Walker moved to 150, his best score this season, and the wicketkeeper Geraint Jones made an unbeaten 66 as Kent recorded their highest total for seven years. Ferley, who has played for England Under-19s, then lifted Kent's hopes with the wickets of Swann and Mal Loye in his first four overs to reduce Lancashire to 30 for two. Hooper and Mark Chilton responded with stylish half-centuries, but they will be grateful for any of the thunderstorms forecast for today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
