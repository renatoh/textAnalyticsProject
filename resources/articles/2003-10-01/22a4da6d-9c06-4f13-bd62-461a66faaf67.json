Yet, wonderfully enough, as it turns out, Kahn, this monster of muscular authority, has over the past year been shown to be terribly human after all and his mistakes are as remarkable for their excruciating timing as they once were for their rarity. There was his despair when he spilled the ball at the feet of Ronaldo in the 2002 World Cup Final. And, after England's 5-1 victory in Munich, images of the final scoreboard were flashed around the world, generally with the back of Kahn's head in the foreground as he stood staring, aghast, at the numbers. He admirably rejected the option of blaming his World Cup fumble against Brazil on two injured fingers. 'That had nothing to do with it,' he said the next day. 'There is no consolation. I have to live with this mistake myself. Because of it, everything is lost. It was my only mistake in seven games, and I was punished. That's 10 times as bitter.' But living with that mistake seems to have been more difficult than the sometimes short-tempered goalkeeper had expected. Since the World Cup, problems have piled up. Of several on-field misdemeanours towards the end of last season, the worst was a nasty foul on Leverkusen striker Thomas Brdaric, whom he grabbed violently around the neck. Escaping with a yellow card, Kahn offered to resign as Bayern captain, but did not apologise. 'That's Kahn,' he said, speaking of himself in the third person. 'Those are my emotions. I will not let the moralists take anything from me.' Then he was caught playing golf all day and partying until after 5am while injured. The club fined him and coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said: 'That was disappointing. Someone in rehab can't be in the disco until the early hours.' In March, Kahn added to his troubles by leaving Simone, his heavily pregnant wife and the mother of his four-year-old daughter, Katharina. Soon afterwards, he was photographed, in a Munich nightclub, kissing 21-year-old Verena Kerth, a blonde with a pierced nose and a penchant for extremely short skirts. In the VIP section, they indulged in champagne-fuelled snogging sessions, from which he paused to smoke cigarettes. The man whose dedication to his sport and young family had seemed unlimited would soon be appearing on the gossip pages more regularly than in the sports sections. He tried a reconciliatory holiday with Simone and the children: however, he spent much of the time on the phone to Verena. On his return to Germany, he slipped back into his by now regular disco appearances with her, smoking and knocking back the champagne. The 34-year-old, who has been with Bayern Munich since 1994, playing more than 400 Bundesliga games and 60 for his country, seemed set to lose it all. His game had faltered at crucial moments, his attitude was becoming belligerent and his domestic life had imploded. An early midlife crisis? One top German football writer described it as delayed puberty, ominously leaving open the possibility that the real midlife crisis may be yet to come. Of late, Kahn has regained a semblance of control over his life, even if his on-pitch performances so far this season have been mostly disappointing. He let in four goals from four shots in the first two Bundesliga matches; then, after conceding three goals against Bayer Leverkusen, he claimed to be suffering from a mysterious eye condition that was blurring his vision. Still, he is beginning to tidy up his disturbed personal life. His wife moved out of their Munich home with the children. In July, he introduced his lover to his team-mates at a dinner. The couple wore matching white suits, although Verena was wearing only a black bra under her jacket. Kahn also took Verena to meet his brother and father. 'She was pleasant and polite,' said brother Axel. Celebrity magazine aktuelle reported that Kahn told Verena, in the nicest possible terms, to tone down her dress sense, show a little less leg and, if possible, be pictured doing some kind of sport - in addition, one assumes, to disco dancing and public displays of affection, however energetic they may have been. It seemed she was listening and recently turned up to a Bayern match in an Adidas top, winning more sympathy points by sitting among the fans. The couple were even dubbed 'The Beckhams of Schwabing' after being seen in matching fawn-coloured clothes while out shopping. Is Kahn over the worst? He is determined to end his playing career with Bayern and perhaps, one day, take over as manager. Yet the future is not all promising. Simone, who is filing for divorce, was photographed at a party in a T-shirt bearing the words: 'Like a thief in the night, I'm gonna get what's mine.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
