The starchy 1960s household of Fabrice Luchini and Sandrine Kiberlain unravels with the arrival of a new maid: the moderately fiery Spaniard Mar\u00eda Gonzalez, played by Natalia Verbeke. Luchini almost rescues it from its own complacency, but the script is equal parts blocked toilets and soft-boiled eggs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
