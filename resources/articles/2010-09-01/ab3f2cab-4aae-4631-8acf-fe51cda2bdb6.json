At the end of his stay, the penniless Spiers enlisted a fellow athlete to help him build a man-sized wooden box, in which he then air-freighted himself back to Australia. Hunkered inside his crate, Spiers duly made it to Perth, despite having almost dehydrated on the runway during a stopover in Bombay. It is interesting to contrast the heroic \u2013 albeit borderline delusional \u2013 gumption of Spiers with Phillips Idowu's announcement this week that he would not be travelling to the Delhi Commonwealth Games in the wake of complaints about the athletes' village and the collapse of a stadium footbridge. \"I cannot take any risk whatsoever, no matter how small,\" Idowu declared on Twitter, presumably while being winched slowly from his lead-lined sleep chamber by hired ninja guards and strapped into his padded high chair for a breakfast of pre\u2011masticated custard. There are a number of conclusions you may draw from this. The first is that Idowu, in common with a number of similarly minded team-mates, believes there is a genuine chance he will be hit by a collapsing item of city infrastructure while competing in the triple jump. It may be useful to point out here that of all human beings Idowu is perhaps best placed to avoid this hazard, his hopping, skipping and jumping capabilities being ideally suited to escaping falling debris in a track and field scenario. At the same time this may also be a useful safety measure in future: how likely is Idowu to be hit by a falling bridge at this event? Is he only likely to be hit by a bridge for a short period? Or is he likely to be hit by a bridge throughout the early rounds and later stages of competition? If Idowu really did have to be hit by a bridge, I would suggest the best moment for this might be while he stands paused at the end of his run-up, pouting majestically beneath his headband, chest puffed, conducting the crowd, silken shorts hitched thrillingly high, primed for the terribly serious \u2013 the non-negotiable \u2013 business of his sprint and spring. Another conclusion you may draw is that our top-level athletes, many of whom are now effectively boycotting Delhi, are perhaps being a little precious. Supporting Idowu's stance on the radio the former runner Iwan Thomas intoned gravely: \"As an athlete you're there to do a job and you can't have any distractions no matter how small.\" Really? No distractions at all? Currently I am writing this while being distracted by flu, the pressing question of Chris Tremlett's precise bowling average, a morose conviction of the basic futility of all human acts and the urge to eat a packet of Skips. Unlike Idowu, though, I soldier on. But we should not condemn, even as Delhi is being condemned for its incompetence and poverty. Stars of track and field are beautiful people with fast-twitch muscle fibres and lovely clear complexions, but they also exist by necessity in a bubble of ascetic absorption. Their lives are a blend of agonising exertion and downtime pampering. They don't generally travel to broaden the mind, or take gap years or spend four months wearing the same student-issue stripy cotton trousers and living in a beach hut so lowly even the rats are hunch-backed. Photos of grime-encrusted bathroom fittings in the athletes' village \u2013 where, no doubt, the on-site construction workers are currently billeted \u2013 will have troubled these citizens of the international chain-hotel circuit. Plus New Delhi can be a frightening place. I went there last year to watch the Indian Premier League. Outside the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium overhead power lines held up with string brush your shoulders. Crowds swarm inanely. Things break. Taking a very small degree of personal risk, un-Idowu-like, I somehow soldiered through it all, alongside the 18 million other people who happen to live there all the time. There is no doubt the Games have been mismanaged and that India feels duly chastened and humiliated. As a nation it does have plenty to apologise for: those terrible middle-aged hammy male Bollywood stars with their gnarly sunglassed gangster faces; the new moneyed generation of Prada-class goons. But it seems a little sad that India is being forced to apologise for its poverty and its vast, insoluble muddle. It is also sad that our own response may yet be to turn away, as Idowu already has. Instead it would be nice to regain some sense of sport \u2013 and in particular these, the Friendly Games \u2013 as an arm of international relations, an opportunity for personal gain that also comes with obligations. There will be grime. A ceiling or two may collapse. But there is something to be said for simply getting out there and getting on with it. As Reg Spiers may have mused, as he lay sweltering in his beached wooden crate at Bombay airport, sometimes you've just got to get out of your box and take a look around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
