As her name was announced at the start in Blackheath, almost every runner around her began waving and shouting \u201cPaula! Paula!\u201d The next two hours, 36 minutes and 55 seconds, the time it took Radcliffe to run the 26.2-mile course, became a valedictory lap of honour as 750,000 people applauded her every step. And understandably so. For after years blighted by injury, Radcliffe, 42, had returned to the marathon course where, in 2003, she had set one of the great world records. Her time of 2:15.25 \u2013 more than three minutes quicker than any woman in history \u2013 is so staggering that it ranks alongside Bob Beamon\u2019s 8.90m long jump at the Mexico Olympics and Ron Clarke chopping 36.2 seconds off the world 10,000m record in 1965 in the highest echelons of athletics\u2019 pantheon. Yet Radcliffe\u2019s CV, which includes victory in the marathon at the world championships in 2005, two world cross-country titles, and British records from distances ranging from 3,000m to the marathon, was not the only reason for her popularity. It was her emotional honesty, which came across so vividly and dramatically during the soaring highs and plunging lows in her career, which helped her transcend her sport. Two moments stood out: leaving the track distraught after the 2001 world championships following a blazing row with her husband, Gary, who shouted at her: \u201cWhy the fuck did you do that?\u201d after she finished fourth in the 10,000m final. Then at the 2004 Olympics when, after 22 miles of the marathon, her sick and injured body refused to take another step on the road to Athens and the tears flowed. There was something else too: her outspokenness on performance-enhancing drugs. Throughout her career she urged the authorities to do more to find and punish those who cheated, and at the 2001 world championships in Edmonton she even held up a banner which said \u201cEPO cheats out\u201d as security guards threatened to call the mounties. For years afterwards she was terrified her drinks might be spiked in reprisal. In 2002 she wrote an open letter to the IAAF, athletics\u2019 governing body, urging it to randomly test her blood and urine more frequently, and asking for samples to be frozen so they could be back-tested when better technology emerged. She also called for athletes to be blood profiled, seven years before the biological passport was adopted. Her running ability was exceptional, her anti-doping credentials impeccable. But now, after a tumultuous few days, Radcliffe frets that the pillars on which her reputation has been built are under sustained attack. In her public appearances ever since the MP Jesse Norman \u201couted\u201d her \u2013 he claims unintentionally \u2013 by alluding to the suspicious blood values of a successful British athlete at the London Marathon she has appeared tired, pained and defensive. Radcliffe\u2019s physical therapist Gerard Hartmann, who worked with her for 14 years and insists he never saw anything untoward, admits it has been a difficult period for her. \u201cI don\u2019t think she could be any more wounded than she is,\u201d he says. \u201cTo have promoted clean sport throughout her career and to have her achievements questioned, I know she will not sleep easy with her reputation like it is at the moment. But I also know in my heart and soul she is clean.\u201d Before Radcliffe\u2019s world record in 2003 she was running 150-155 miles a week. And her reward came on a sedate April day with that time of 2:15:25 \u2013 a marathon performance that few expect to be eclipsed in the next decade. Some who have questioned Radcliffe, particularly on social media, have done so on the basis they doubt a woman can run a marathon that quickly without cheating. But one world-leading physiologist, Dr Michael Joyner, of the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, insists that is not the case. \u201cMost people thought it was impossible to climb Mount Everest without oxygen, until somebody did it, and while Radcliffe\u2019s world record is remarkable it is not beyond the realms of possibility that she did it clean,\u201d he says. Joyner also believes Radcliffe has been unfairly maligned. \u201cHer physiology was extraordinary and in the absence of a positive test, any witness testimony, or more complete blood values, no one can be sure that she did anything wrong. It is an exercise in speculation.\u201d How unusual was her physiology? Andrew Jones, the sports scientist who regularly tested Radcliffe\u2019s VO2max (the maximum volume of oxygen an athlete can use), says that at 17 it was already 70ml/kg/min, while most elite female athletes are usually around the mid-60s. \u201cIt was clear with her fitness, and the physical shape she was in, she was going to be breaking world records,\u201d he says. Hartmann and Jones cite Radcliffe\u2019s mental toughness too. Jones says Radcliffe would prefer to fly off the treadmill, risking injury, rather than give up during a test. \u201cPeople look at the blond girl from the outside and think butter wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth,\u201d says Hartmann. \u201cBut beneath it all she was the hardest, toughest athlete I ever met.\u201d However, even those who completely believe in Radcliffe \u2013 and there are many inside the sport who insist she will be vindicated over the row over her blood values \u2013 concede she has not enjoyed the best few days in the battle for public opinion. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday she was clearly unhappy at being asked why she did not \u201chave the bottle\u201d to publish her data. She told Sally Nugent: \u201cI don\u2019t need to do that. You\u2019re the one with the doubts. And, I\u2019m afraid, what it all boils down to is that it\u2019s not my problem.\u201d But clearly it is her problem. Her reputation is under threat. And while Radcliffe believes the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s investigators have shown she has nothing to hide, the world-renowned physiologist Dr Ross Tucker insists she should be doing far more. \u201cBy her own statement last Tuesday she has the data, context, and explanations to satisfy many of the cynical voices \u2013 and yet she doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy? Just come out with it. If I were in her shoes I would say: \u2018I have nothing to hide\u2019 and release all her blood data, including the context of when and where it was taken.\u201d There are those close to Radcliffe who insist she has convincing evidence that can prove her case. Some wonder whether she is waiting to see what the Sunday Times comes back with tomorrow. But in the meantime, the story drags on, day by wearying day. Since finishing her career Radcliffe has worked on the BBC\u2019s athletics coverage and mentored young endurance athletes. She has a degree in modern European studies from Loughborough University, and is fluent in French and German, and many believe she will naturally gravitate to a senior role within the IAAF in the coming years. At the moment, however, she has far more pressing concerns on her mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
