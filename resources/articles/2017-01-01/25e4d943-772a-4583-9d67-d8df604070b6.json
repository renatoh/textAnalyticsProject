McDermott, the Panthers\u2019 defensive coordinator, was announced as the Bills\u2019 new head coach on Wednesday. McDermott replaces Rex Ryan, who was fired at the end of December following two disappointing seasons in Buffalo. The 42-year-old McDermott was one of four contenders for the Bills\u2019 vacant position. Interim coach Anthony Lynn, Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Harold Goodwin and Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Kris Richard also interviewed for the role, but Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula were most impressed with McDermott. McDermott, who has coordinated Carolina\u2019s defense for the past six seasons, becomes the 20th coach in the Bills\u2019 57-year history. The team\u2019s previous eight coaches all posted losing records and failed to make the playoffs. The Bills have not made the postseason since 1999 under Wade Phillips, a 17-year drought that represents the NFL\u2019s longest active streak \u2013 and is tied for the fifth-longest playoff drought in NFL history. Panthers coach Ron Rivera said of McDermott last month: \u201cHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should speak for itself. Sometimes when you hire people, you need to look at not whether or not they\u2019re the hot guy but what they\u2019ve done consistently over a period of time.\u201d But McDermott might have to do without quarterback Tyrod Taylor for the new season. Taylor, who joined Buffalo as a free agent in 2015, signed a six-year contract extension in August, but Bills\u2019 management seems ready to move on at quarterback, and could decide to release him before $30m of his contract becomes guaranteed on 12 March. Buffalo went 7-9 this season and finished third in the AFC East behind the Patriots and Dolphins. In 31 games as Bills coach, Ryan had a 15-16 record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
