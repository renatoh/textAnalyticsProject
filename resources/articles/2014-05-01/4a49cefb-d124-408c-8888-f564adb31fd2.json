Cook, England's Test and one-day captain, is not considered for T20 cricket by his country, but struck 71 from 49 balls to help Essex post 161 for five in a 50-overs match cut to 21 overs per side. This shortened game, courtesy of a five-hour weather delay, should have suited the Sri Lankans, considering they won the World T20 last month. But they never recovered in their pursuit of a Duckworth-Lewis adjusted target of 169 once they were reduced to 44 for four in the ninth over of their reply. Given the conditions on a cold and wet evening in Chelmsford, the tourists will not read too much into the result of their first tour match. By the time next Tuesday's T20 against England at The Oval comes around they will be boosted by the presence of Lasith Malinga, their most potent bowler and T20 captain, who will be back from the Indian Premier League. Cook, though, will take great heart from his innings. He survived a patchy start, which included a drop by the Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews on 37, before putting his foot on the accelerator. He reached 50 in 44 balls with an audacious scooped six off Thisara Perera in the 19th over and then hit an identical shot with the same result in the next, bowled by Dhammika Prasad, before perishing the next ball, caught at long on. Cook took his lead from Ben Foakes, the 21-year-old wicketkeeper, who scored 51 off 31 balls during an 82-run stand between the two. That helped Essex rebuild from 21 for three after Suranga Lakmal had dismissed Mark Pettini and Greg Smith. Ravi Bopara, trapped lbw by Prasad, also went for a two-ball duck. Oliver Newby, the 29-year-old seam bowler on a month's loan from Lancashire, undermined the tourists' reply when he trapped Kusal Perera with the fourth ball of the innings. He then had Mahela Jayawardene caught behind by Foakes in the fifth over as Sri Lanka slipped to 31 for two. Monty Panesar dismissed Tillakaratne Dilshan leg before, and by the time Greg Smith's spin had accounted for Lahiru Thirimanne and Mathews, the Sri Lankans' chances of victory were remote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
