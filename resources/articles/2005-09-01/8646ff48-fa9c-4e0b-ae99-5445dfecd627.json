Few leaders commented publicly in detail, aware of the tortuous negotiations that will take place in Berlin after the inconclusive result. But Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, indicated the importance of establishing a stable government in Europe's largest country - which bankrolls the European Union. \"I certainly hope that as soon as possible a stable government comes out from Germany,\" Mr Barroso said in Brussels. \"Germany is the ... engine of Europe. Without a dynamic Germany, Europe cannot recover.\" Sunday's election was seen across Europe as one of the most important for the EU in years. Supporters of a Merkel chancellorship hoped it would open up the Franco-German partnership to others and strengthen the hand of reformers, such as Nicolas Sarkozy in France and Tony Blair. Those calculations will have to be reassessed, with the possibility that Gerhard Schr\u00f6der may survive as chancellor. French ministers insisted little would change because Franco-German relations are so strongly institutionalised. Catherine Colonna, the French Europe minister who is a close ally of President Jacques Chirac, said: \"If one thing is certain, it is that the French-German relationship will not be affected by what happens in Berlin. France will work with the new German government, whatever it is.\" Mr Sarkozy, the French interior minister, who had hoped that a Merkel victory would strengthen his reform-or-die 2007 presidential bid, attempted to put on a brave face. In a statement hailing what he described as Mrs Merkel's \"election victory\", Mr Sarkozy declared that German voters had \"confirmed the ideas and values that we share are just. I know you will put them in place with intelligence, courage and determination\". Downing Street, which had hoped a Merkel victory would help Britain modernise the EU budget before it relinquishes the presidency at the end of the year, said it would not comment on an ongoing election procedure. Although the prime minister formally endorsed Mr Schr\u00f6der's candidacy, his visit to the CDU leader this summer infuriated the chancellor. The diplomatic snub was one of the factors that poisoned the EU summit in mid-June when leaders failed to reach an agreement on the union's budget. If Mr Schr\u00f6der remains in his job as chancellor - or his SPD dictates terms in a \"grand coalition\" - Downing Street will find it difficult to win support for a deal on the budget. Mr Blair wants to put Britain's multibillion-pound rebate on the table in exchange for reforms of farm subsidies. One German diplomatic source believes European leaders will not have any difficulty assessing the difference between either a Merkel or a continuing Schr\u00f6der chancellorship. \"In substance, on the big European issues there is no great difference - the idea that Angela Merkel would suddenly embrace the British rebate is a little far-fetched,\" the source said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
