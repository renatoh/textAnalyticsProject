The England team bus was flanked by van loads of armed police as it accelerated away from the stadium on Sunday night, blue lights flashing as the convoy gathered pace. Such treatment was driven primarily by security requirements but Lyon\u2019s Bronze is accustomed to the VIP treatment. \u201cAt the last World Cup [Canada 2015] I was walking around with stars in my eyes the whole time,\u201d the Northumberland-born defender said as she prepared to head for a resort hotel on the Normandy coast where England play Argentina in Le Havre on Friday night. \u201cI\u2019m still excited but I find it easier to settle into the games now. I know I belong at this level.\u201d Not that being acknowledged as the world\u2019s best right-back is stress free. \u201cThere was no pressure at the last World Cup and that was enjoyable,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cFour years ago, when we got to Canada, Alex Scott was our first choice right-back and nobody knew who I was. Now, though, people have an expectation of me. But the great thing today is that I\u2019m used to performing on the biggest stages.\u201d She and Nikita Parris shone down the right flank as England deconstructed Scotland in an impressive first half before succumbing to a mixof fatigue and slight complacency in the heat of the second period. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the ideal performance but in the first half we played extremely well,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cBut the second half has kept us on our toes, striving to improve \u2013 and you can\u2019t ask for anything more than to win your first game in the tournament. \u201cIt felt really good to be out there. When I was younger I used to get a few nerves but not now \u2013 and the encouraging thing was we had a few young players who showed no nervousness. That\u2019s encouraging.\u201d The same could be said of her partnership with Parris, who operated wide on the right in Nice. It is a double act likely to be reprised at Lyon next season after the latter recently followed in Bronze\u2019s footsteps and swapped Manchester City for the French champions. \u201cNikita can be as good as she wants to be, that\u2019s the truth,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cShe has all the attributes she needs to be one of the best strikers in the world, she has been showing that all season at City. She\u2019s been prolific, she\u2019s got an eye for goal, she\u2019s tenacious and she has the speed and energy. We\u2019ve got a really good partnership; we enjoy playing together.\u201d Phil Neville believes Jill Scott can continue playing until she celebrates her 40th birthday and maintains that one of the oldest but fittest players is \u201cirreplaceable\u201d at this World Cup. \u201cJill was sensational in the win against Scotland,\u201d said England\u2019s coach. \u201cWith her size, her quality, her energy up and down the pitch, she\u2019s irreplaceable.\u201d Scott shone in central midfield as Shelley Kerr\u2019s side were beaten, playing a key role in suppressing the usually destructive influence of Kim Little and Caroline Weir. \u201cOur game plan was about Jill getting up the pitch and robbing the opposition, which she did time and time again,\u201d said Neville. \u201cWeir and Little are Scotland\u2019s best players and our pressing suffocated them really well.\u201d At 32 Scott dictated such containment manoeuvres. \u201cJill can play until she\u2019s 40,\u201d said England\u2019s coach.\u201dHer and Lucy are always quickest on the bleep test and the other fitness tests we do. She never misses a single training session. If you ask her to drop out of one she goes mad at you. She\u2019s built like a marathon runner, that\u2019s why she\u2019s so fit. Indeed the young Scott was a schoolgirl cross-country champion on her native Wearside before switching to football after joining Sunderland Ladies. Neville has no doubt she can continue to star for both England and Manchester City for some time to come. \u201cYes, there will have to be times when we rest Jill but her energy levels are frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is one of our best and she knows how to play the game; that\u2019s why she\u2019s still got another two or three tournaments left with me. Nowadays 32 is a young age for a midfielder.\u201d He senses his old Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane would have approved of Scott. \u201cJIll\u2019s a throwback to the days when players went down injured but got up without moaning,\u201d said Neville. \u201cShe wins every tackle, every header, she slides into everything. She\u2019s infectious, she\u2019s got real quality and she\u2019s a coach for me on the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
