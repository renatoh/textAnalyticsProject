Thanks for being patient today and tune in tomorrow to find out what twist this compelling Test can take next. Good night. 9.08pm No news, which in this case is bad news. England won't mind if it keeps raining, though. \"The thought occurs that the 100 runs the West Indies scored in the sunshine look horribly valuable - and Gayle's knock truly inspired,\" writes the email-happy William Symonds. \"We dearly need a lead - what chance Freddy to club a quickfire ton tomorrow?\" Slim, I would have thought. 8.58pm I'd be very surprised if we get any more play today. Even if the infernal rain stops, the light is very poor indeed. England will be happy to start again tomorrow. Assuming it ever stops raining. \"Thanks for great coverage here in the wee small hours - all thanks to my cell phone,\" writes Will Symonds. \"Am in mountains of West Java. We can actually get occasional coverage in Jakarta on the telly but for some reason - ie non payment of the fee - all the video is in negative colour which makes for interesting viewing. And of course makes Steve Harmison look even more like Curtly Ambrose.\" I'm not sure that's very PC, Will, but in the absence of any other email, I'll let it go. 8.52pm The forecast for the rest of this game is for scattered showers. If it doesn't rain, we'll almost certainly get a result, because the pitch is so poor. The covers are on and it's still raining. \"What is Neil doing up at 6.15am on a Sunday morning?\" cackles Matthew Wassell. \"Probably wasted his time though if he got up just to gloat at a few Englishmen, as I fancy England to romp away with this match.\" Do you know something we don't, Matthew? 8.46pm Butcher and Hussain have done superbly well to keep the damage down to two wickets. The pitch is appallingly inconsistent given that we haven't even had the equivalent of a day's play yet, but they've got behind the line and frustrated some probing bowling from the West Indies. Butcher was lucky to survive a sitter to Chanderpaul at second slip on 20, but you need some luck to survive on this pitch. \"I'm really enjoying this Polish-dumpling-fuelled agro,\" enthuses Amy Jackson. \"Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\" What have I done? 8.40pm: rain stops play The umpires are consulting as the rain gets heavier and the light fades. And - finally - they decide enough is enough. Butcher and Hussain hurry off, but Brian Lara looks disgruntled. Not sure why. 23rd over: England 54-2 (Butcher 25, Hussain 20) Sanford releases the pressure with a wide long-hop which Butcher helps over backward point for four with a real flourish - the first runs for 15 balls. Sanford then raps Butcher on the gloves as he tries to get out of the way: the suggestion was that he didn't pick that delivery up. It's very gloomy out there and it's starting to drizzle. England would be off in a flash if the umpires offered them the light, and Butcher is fortunate when the ball pops off his bat handle into the vacant short-leg region. 22nd over: England 50-2 (Butcher 21, Hussain 20) Collymore is really making the ball move around here, mainly into Hussain's pads. But out of nowhere he gets one to move away and take the outside edge. Hussain played that well, though, straight into the ground. West Indies are bowling an impeccable line here. 21st over: England 50-2 (Butcher 21, Hussain 20) Sanford is trying to tempt Butcher by slanting the ball invitingly across him, but Butcher is applying the lessons he learned in that near-fatal over from Collymore - in other words, leave as much as possible. \"Good morning to you and your readers,\" chirps Neil Stork-Brett. \"It's 6.15am here in Brisbane. Let me set the scene for you: the sun is shining, the birds are singing, the scent of frangipani wafts through the window and the gloat warning is set to \"extreme\" thanks to a series victory in Sri Lanka.\" Do you expect me to be jealous, Neil? 20th over: England 50-2 (Butcher 21, Hussain 20) Collymore has immediately settled into a lovely line outside off. He was unlucky in the first Test, when he beat the bat several times without reward. Even so, Butcher brings up England's half-century with a nudge for one to wide mid-on. It's been a struggle - but a compelling one. Collymore thinks he's trapped Hussain leg-before, but that one hit him outside the line of off. The next ball brings an even more impassioned appeal as Hussain gets half-forward to one that cuts back into him. That was closer. \"Both Neil and Adam seem to be struggling for spelling,\" writes Paul Crowe. \"According to \"Milliespierogi\" the little morsels are pierogi; and can be steamed, boiled, baked, grilled or deep-fat fried.\" I think the spelling can vary, Paul. 19th over: England 49-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 20) Hussain seems to be attracting all the deliveries of uneven bounce as Sanford skids another one through outside off. This is worrying for England, who will presumably be batting last. A better over from Sanford. \"So Kurt Stengel just does not want to admit that its goat meat,\" writes Neil Adamson, posibly grasping the wrong end of the stick and brandishing it wildly. \"They probably just wash the curry sauce off with vodka.\" 18th over: England 49-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 20) Corey Collymore replaces Collins (9-5-15-1), and the bowling change almost brings a wicket. Butcher edges his second ball to the left of Shivnarine Chanderpaul at second slip, but Chanderpaul makes a mess of it and Butcher survives. What a let-off! Butcher then goes after a wide one and is lucky not to get an edge through to the keeper. He just needs to concentrate. A great first over from Collymore. \"Perogies are big here in Winnipeg thanks to the large Ukrainian community within the city and the southern part of the province,\" writes Steve Light, taking our sociology lesson into undreamt-of realms. \"Safeway sells them in big packets in the freezer section of the supermarket. Bacon and potato are big favorites.\" 18th over: England 49-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 20) Hussain nibbles, almost fatally, at Sanford, but then launches him magnificently through extra cover as Sanford overpitches. That was England's first run for 20 deliveries. To celebrate, Hussain runs the next ball down to third man with that characteristic open face for four more. It's drinks, and England are fighting hard here. 17th over: England 41-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 12) The admirable Collins is in his ninth over now, and he's still posing problems, even for the fluent Butcher. A maiden. Kurt Stengel has finally written in with a definition of his own. You're too late, of course, but I'll humour you anyway. \"Pirogi are small dough parcels filled with (indeterminate) meat, or mushrooms and cabbage, or even fruit. Very bland food I have to say, but a Polish staple. They eat some very strange things here I can tell you.\" 16th over: England 41-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 12) Sanford is definitely less threatening than Best, but England can't afford to relax here at all. The bounce is up and down and the skies are a swing-inducing grey. And Hussain keeps flapping angrily at movement behind the bowler's arm. The problem is, the irritators happen to be the West Indies team on their balcony! One ball there virtually skidded along the ground. Luckily for Hussain, it was outside off stump. A maiden. Stephen Allan has helpfully provided a link to everything you need to know about pirogies. We aim to please. 15th over: England 41-2 (Butcher 20, Hussain 12) Collins continues over the wicket to Butcher, who hammers a wide ball through the covers off the back foot. Without wishing to jinx him, he looks in prime form. And that - get ready! - was a prime cut from Butcher. I thank you. I sense another culinary riff, this time on the subject of mysterious Polish munchie, \"pirogi\". \"Neil Adamson needs to eat at Alycia's in Winnipeg in order to rid himself of his misinformed contempt for perogies,\" writes Geoff Woods, subtly altering the spelling. 14th over: England 37-2 (Butcher 16, Hussain 12) Enter Adam Sanford into the attack in place of Best (6-2-15-1). He had a poor game in Jamaica, and his first ball here is a gimme for a single on Butcher's hip. Hussain then latches onto a wide overpitched delivery and guides it backward of point for four. Typical Hussain, just opening the face. \"Please tell me more about this fellow Best,\" writes Amy Jackson. \"I'm intrigued, I was wondering where all the pratty bowlers had gone in cricket, although I was reassured by the return of Warne.\" He's just a bit theatrical, Amy. He's clearly trying to goad the batsmen into playing a silly shot - it worked with Graham Thorpe in Jamaica, didn't it? 13th over: England 32-2 (Butcher 15, Hussain 8) Collins to Butcher, and that's a tidy over, ruined by a leg-bye off the final ball of the over. Extras are up to eight - already a quarter of the total. \"Actually,\" replies Kurt Stengel a propos the pirogi question, \"with all that rain my intention was to give you something to occupy yourself with.\" Well, it's stopped raining, Kurt. So you can enlighten us all. 12th over: England 31-2 (Butcher 15, Hussain 8) Butcher is making the most of what little strike he is getting. Best's first ball is on his pads and that's four runs - help yourself - through midwicket. He drops the next ball into the covers and calls Hussain through for a quick single. Best strays again and Hussain helps him for four leg-byes to fine leg. Very handy indeed. \"I'm still watching your riveting over-by-over coverage,\" writes Luke Clippinger. \"It's raining here in New Albany, Indiana. Anyone out there know if there are any cricket organizations in the Midwestern US?\" 11th over: England 22-2 (Butcher 10, Hussain 8) Collins is mixing it up well here, angling the ball across Hussain, then bringing it back into him - classic left-arm swing bowling. England are doing their best to hang on in there at the moment. This is gripping stuff. Steve Hart checks in with another odds dispatch: \"2/1 West Indies, 13/8 Draw, 6/4 England.\" England marginal favourites, eh? 10th over: England 22-2 (Butcher 10, Hussain 8) Hussain is hogging the strike here, but he escapes by scampering a leg-bye off Best, who is still pouting like a pantomime dame. Here's Kurt Stengel, who for some reason refuses to give me the Polish definition of culinary delicacy pirogi. \"Neil Adamson with his Caribbean twist on pirogi has obviously let the cricket get to his head,\" he writes. \"Pity.\" Why the secrecy, Kurt? 9th over: England 21-2 (Butcher 10, Hussain 8) I've never thought England play left-arm seamers very well, and Collins is backing me up. He looks dangerous here swinging the ball back into Hussain from over the wicket. But Hussain likes a scrap, and pushes a no-ball to mid-off for a single. That gives the strike to Butcher, who responds with a dreamy cover-drive for four. Shot! 8th over: England 15-2 (Butcher 6, Hussain 7) Hussain squeezes out a yorker from Best, who glares at him as if he's just said something about his mother. Next ball, Best aims for another yorker, but he overpitches and Hussain helps him through the vacant mid-on for two runs. The next ball brings a big shout for lbw, but that was missing leg and going too high. As usual, Best is full of it - pulling faces, posturing, pratting around. I think he's what you call a character. He's not a bad bowler either. Meanwhile, the emails have gone quiet. You're obviously too riveted by the cricket to get in touch. Hussain prevents a maiden by working Best's final delivery to deep backward square for a single. 7th over: England 12-2 (Butcher 6, Hussain 4) It's the left-armer Pedro Collins from the Pavilion End to Butcher, who ducks under an 85mph bouncer. Collins reminds me of the former England seamer Gladstone Small in that neither have much of a neck. Collins isn't in Small's class (his shoulders are disappointingly distinct), but there is a hint of the coathanger about him. A maiden. 6th over: England 12-2 (Butcher 6, Hussain 4) Tino Best finishes off his over, four and a half hours after he started it. He's charging in and the crowd are right behind him. But Hussain pulls his final ball imperiously for four. What a shot! In theory, there are a minimum of 39 overs still to come. 7.13pm Out come the umpires, and for once it's not to inspect the pitch. It's still cloudy, but, hey, let's not get picky here. England, remember, are 8 for 2, with Mark Butcher on 6 and Nasser Hussain yet to score. 7.10pm If you're wondering why play hasn't resumed yet, it's because they're still removing the last of the covers. They're now saying 7.15pm. Sound familiar? \"Pirogis are little dumplings stuffed with the remains of yesterday's goat curry,\" reports Neil Adamson in answer to a question from earlier in the day. \"Hence the need for vodka.\" It all becomes clear. Thanks Neil. 7.04pm I'm so overcome by the possibility of writing something other than world-weary drivel (yes, yes, I know I'm walking into an obvious joke here), that words momentarily escape me. \"Please relay a message to Bob Horrocks,\" writes Ethan Sutherland, swiftly coming to my rescue. \"He left his windcheater in Poachers in Beijing this evening. I've got it. And tell him the girl he was talking to, Li Ruijin (Cindy) was interested in giving him her phone number.\" Yep, we do romance too. 7pm The stumps are in, and we should have some cricket for you in five minutes' time, when England will - irritating downpours permitting - resume on 8 for 2 in reply to West Indies' 208. Ah, the turncoact returns. \"You are entitled to describe me as disloyal,\" writes Chris Harris from Munich, who walked out on us earlier. \"And I apologise. I should really have missed watching the rugby in the Irish pub and read your inspiring updates on the weather situation in Port-of-Spain. I hope that now I am back, play will restart.\" Perhaps you should leave us more often, Chris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
