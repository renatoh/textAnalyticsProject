England saved the first Test at Lord's after batting through most of a less-than-gripping final day for the loss of just three wickets, and recovering much of the psychological ground they surrendered on Saturday. They even took a wicket in the evening gloom when Sri Lanka batted a second time. It wasn't pretty, but a rearguard like this is not to be sniffed at. Even on a dead pitch and against a tired and Murali-less Sri Lankan attack, England still had to bat for more than two days, which is not something they manage too often. Leading the resistance today was Nasser Hussain, Mark Butcher, who hit a careful 105, and Graham Thorpe, with a sparkling 65. John Crawley then helped himself to a comfortable unbeaten 41. As England set about adding to their overnight score of 321 for 2, the records and milestones came and went as quickly as England's batsmen during their first-innings collapse. The top five all passed fifty in the same innings of a Test for the first time since 1938-39. Their total was the highest by any side in the second innings in a Lord's Test. It was the first time England had made 500 since January 1997 against New Zealand at Auckland, 61 Tests ago. And it was the first time they had done so in their second innings since 1975, when they scored 538 against Australia at the Oval. The tone for the day was set by Butcher and Hussain, who between them failed to hit a boundary until 12.30pm, when Hussain pulled Ruchira Perera through midwicket. But when Hussain reached 68 he was triggered by Daryl Hair, who gave him out lbw to a ball from Perera that pitched outside leg and would have passed harmlessly over the stumps. It was a bathetic end to a match-saving four-and-a-half-hour innings, but Hussain managed to restrain himself. He and Butcher had added 160 for the third wicket. After lunch Butcher inched towards his fourth Test hundred, which he greeted with a smile and a low-key wave of the bat. But he didn't get much further. Trying to turn a Thorpe paddle from two into three, Butcher was beaten by Chaminda Vaas's inch-perfect throw from fine leg and was needlessly run out. That made it 432 for 4 but England were almost safe. Thorpe - typically - provided the brightest batting of the day with a 68-ball half-century, which felt like a whirlwind knock in the circumstances, and by the time he lifted Aravinda de Silva to mid-on five minutes before tea, a draw was inevitable. Things petered out in the evening sunshine as Crawley and Alec Stewart improved their batting averages against some friendly spin, although there was a frisson of excitement when Hussain finally declared at 529 for 5, leaving Sri Lanka with an hour to bat. In that time England struck a blow before the next Test when Marvan Atapattu chipped Andy Caddick to Mark Butcher at square leg to depart for 7. At this point your mind went back to yesterday morning, when Sanath Jayasuriya dropped Michael Vaughan on 28 and 33 at first slip. If either of those chances had been held, Sri Lanka might have been heading to Edgbaston with a 1-0 lead. Instead they were made to toil as England got their heads down - but their chins up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
