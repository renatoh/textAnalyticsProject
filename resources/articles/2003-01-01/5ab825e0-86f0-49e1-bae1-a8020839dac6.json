Southampton had been unbeaten at St Mary's all season and went into the game, in front of the new stadium's record crowd, as the Premiership's form horses, Michael Owen and his team had no doubt noted. Liverpool, by contrast, had failed to win their previous 11 League games, their worst run since 1949. Football being football, naturally Liverpool prevailed. Emile Heskey, as muscular a presence as he should be more often, scored the only goal but there should have been several more as Liverpool dictated and dominated the game. Owen, enduring a difficult time amid allegations about his gambling habits, was particularly culpable, making it a more edgy last 10 minutes for Liverpool than it should have been. There was an unexpected appetite to Liverpool and an approach that told of G\u00e9rard Houllier having studied recent Saints videos. Wide on their right, Fabrice Fernandes gives Southampton ingenuity going forward but he is no defender. Behind him, Colin Telfer, not a natural right-back, is thus left exposed. And Liverpool saw that John Arne Riise had plenty of the ball to expose him. In central midfield, meanwhile, Steven Gerrard began to look more like his commanding self, Danny Murphy alongside aiding him in controlling the initial tempo. Up front, Heskey looked to have taken recent constructive criticism on board and started to use his imposing physique to greater advantage. Chances came immediately. Anti Niemi could not hold Riise's fierce shot and Michael Owen almost turned home the rebound, the Finnish goalkeeper smothering his attempt. Next, Niemi turned a shot from Murphy round a post before Owen, having been found by El Hadji Diouf, playing wide on the right, shot over the bar on his left foot. The promise of a goal then became a reality. Heskey was fouled on the right touchline by Michael Svensson and from his inswinging free-kick, incisively delivered, Heskey eluded his marker to plant a firm downward header into Niemi's left corner. More should have followed before half-time. Riise met Diouf's low cross with a firm sidefoot but Telfer deflected the goalbound attempt; Gerrard sent Heskey in on goal past Svensson but his shot was straight at Niemi. Gerrard was then close with a powerful shot after a surging run from midfield. The interval could not come quickly enough for the Southampton manager, Gordon Strachan, who had much work to do, both in reorganising and reinvigorating his team, after seeing them barely trouble Chris Kirkland. Indeed, the only real worry for Liverpool was that for all their pressure, they were ahead by only a single goal. Indeed it has happened to Liverpool so often of late - forging ahead, nerves creeping in, conceding an equaliser - that their assistant coach Sammy Lee had them going through another warm-up routine five minutes before the restart. Last Saturday at Anfield, Aston Villa had done something similar and dominated the second half. That Southampton were likely to provide more testing opposition in the second period was illustrated when Jo Tessem immediately sent in a long-range shot which was comfortably dealt with by Kirkland. Soon Liverpool were flowing again, though, and they missed the most golden of opportunities to double their lead. Riise again broke free on the left and spotted Owen in space in the centre. A delightful pass found him free but, barely believably given his record, he sidefooted his shot wide of Niemi's right post. Strachan spiced up his side with three substitutions, one of them the lesser-spotted Ecuadorian striker Agustin Delgado replacing Wayne Bridge, who thereby failed to finish a game for the first time in more than 100 appearances stretching back over two years. The changes did produce a late Southampon flurry but still little to trouble Kirkland. Liverpool might have had worries about having been in this position only to waste it but this time there was little to worry about, so strangely lame were the form horses. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
