Just Ben.\" But while loitering outside his London hotel room, I am offered some unsolicited advice by the PR assistant from the distributor of his latest film, The Wackness. \"Don't forget to address him as 'Sir Ben',\" she warns severely. \"But he told Stuart Jeffries to call him 'Ben',\" I protest. \"Ooh, I don't know anything about that,\" comes the twitchy reply. \"His people told us it has to be 'Sir.'\" I think I can detect the faint crunching of eggshells. As I am ushered in, the 65-year-old actor sweeps quietly but magnificently toward me across the carpet. He is wearing an immaculately trimmed little beard, and he seems to be floating. He is one of those men who comports himself so confidently that his inner conviction that he is in fact a giant overshadows the reality \u2014 which is that he is small enough to be his own action figure. I must admit I get a bit caught up in his bountiful hospitality. \"Ryan!\" he half-purrs, half-booms, hand outstretched. He could be welcoming me to his daughter's wedding. I reach out and grab that hand as though we haven't seen one another since our salad days at Oxford when we pushed the bursar's bed through the streets for a rag week jape. (Neither of us were at Oxford. But he makes me feel as though we were.) It's lovely. We even seem to be chuckling together at some unspoken joke. That's when it happens. \"Ben!\" I reply warmly, followed instantly by a voice in my head that says: \"D'Oh!\" I register an infinitesimal change in his eyes \u2014 a tremor, a wince \u2014 and somewhere in the background I'm certain I hear a PR being told she will never eat lunch in this town again. But Kingsley recovers quickly, and soon it's all Oxford again. \"What's your background? Tell me about yourself. Do you love your job?\" These are his questions, not mine. Oh yes, I tell him, I love my job. \"Good,\" he says, sounding genuinely relieved, as though he had been mulling over this matter in the hours preceding our meeting. \"Well, I love my job too, so that's something we have in common.\" We have come to talk about The Wackness, a baldly manipulative coming-of-age story set in the mid-1990s in which \u2014 hey! \u2014 things are never the same again after that summer. Didn't The Opposite of Sex kill off movies like this? Oh well. At least Kingsley is a treat as Dr Squires, the dope-head psychiatrist with mad-professor hair, to whom Luke, the teenage hero (Josh Peck), turns in his hour of need. Not everyone has warmed to Kingsley's comically indulgent turn as the immature shrink, whose midlife crisis manifests itself in Biggie Smalls impressions and some full-on face-sucking with one of the Olsen twins. Richard Brody in the New Yorker berated what he called Kingsley's \"weird-old-man routine\u2026 [it's] fake and vain, a shameless play for an Oscar nod.\" When I ask Kingsley if playing Squires was like pretending to be a little boy, his eyes light up. \"Yes,\" he says firmly. \"You. Have. Hit. The bull's eye.\" He takes a deep breath, as though recovering from a shock. \"My secret, my shared secret with the director Jonathan Levine \u2014 and sometimes you have to have them \u2014 was exactly that: 'I'm playing the child.' And Jonathan said: 'Got it!'\" All this is delivered in a voice that gets quieter with every word. I think he believes there is an actor in the next suite, whiskey tumbler pressed to the wall, hoping to steal the tricks of his trade. \"And that was my message to myself throughout the shoot,\" he continues. \"'You can't grow up. You cannot grow up.'\" I ask him when he nailed the essence of Dr Squires and, as with my first question, he treats this enquiry with a respectfulness that would be flattering if it weren't so exaggerated. \"It has to happen,\" he says. \"You're absolutely right. It must happen. That 'Ah!' moment. You've got to have it. I'm sure painters have it. They're working away on a canvas and suddenly they go, 'Ah! There it is.' Certainly I knew I wanted Squires to have his brain coming out through his scalp, so I knew he'd need to have hair. Because this\" \u2014 by which he means his own shaved head \u2014 \"is too neat, too contained.\" He strokes his scalp, which is buffed to such a bright sheen that you could use it to check that your tie is straight. \"At that point, I thought, 'Well, I can't quite see the portrait yet, but there's something there \u2014 yes! \u2014 in the corner of the canvas. Look!'\" He is gesturing to an invisible painting. Bizarrely, I find my gaze wandering toward it. \"But it really happened when we shot the first scene. Josh is in my office. He says, 'Do you want me to lie on the couch or anything?' And the way he said it left me no choice but to reply: 'Do ... do you want to lie on the couch?' I realised that everything this man does is for the first time. That was the first little breath of 'Ah!' that I found.\" The joy of being in Kingsley's company is that he seems to have slipped his moorings. This sensation has also permeated his work since Sexy Beast, the 2000 thriller that represented a miraculous on-screen rebirth. His portrayal of the gangster Don Logan, who was barking in both senses of the word, comprehensively altered the world's perception of him; it was like no other image-reboot since Brando in The Godfather. Playing the title role in Richard Attenborough's 1982 Gandhi had dragged him from relative obscurity and won him the Best Actor Oscar, but in career terms it also left him washed up on a desert island with other people's reverence for company. How do you cast someone whom the whole world knows as an inspirational symbol of peace? He may as well have played a paedophile for all the good it did him with casting directors. In the years immediately post-Gandhi, it was all high-gloss prestige. He had prestige enough to make you puke. He briefly became Harold Pinter's cinematic envoy, measuring out the writer's strategically-weighted words in two dead-from-the-brain-down movies, Betrayal (1983) and the winsome Turtle Diary (1985). There were bright spots where his implied benevolence was used in a sophisticated fashion, and twisted into comedy: he was a savvy Dr Watson to Michael Caine's bumbling Sherlock Holmes in Without a Clue (1988), and earned his second of four Oscar nominations as a hushed Meyer Lansky opposite Warren Beatty in Bugsy (1990). These peaks, and a brief return to the pinnacle of nobility and good taste in Schindler's List (1993), must have kept him nourished through the lean late-1990s. Did he close his eyes and think about Spielberg and Beatty to help him forget that, yes, he really was being directed by Michael Winner in Parting Shots (1998) and, yes, he was billed below Chris Rea? But there had been a flicker, during Roman Polanski's Death and the Maiden (1994), of something cruel. He played a respectable doctor suspected by Sigourney Weaver of being her former torturer; the inspired pairing of the itsy-bitsy Kingsley and the statuesque Weaver forced you to rethink your preconceptions about aggressors and victims. He sees much of his career in terms of exactly this kind of double-act \u2014 \"dances,\" he calls them. I point out that Sexy Beast falls into this category, with its warped courtship between Don and his old mucker Gal (Ray Winstone). \"Yes. It's a love story. I think Iago is in love with Othello. And I think Don loves Gal. Loves him. Like a soldier loves a general. These dynamics, to me, are everything. There's no film without them.\" Since Sexy Beast, he appears newly liberated. He can do anything now, from playing himself like some kind of minor, spoilt royalty dazed by riches in The Sopranos to carrying off a still and sober portrait of an Iranian immigrant in the otherwise overblown House of Sand and Fog. These days he is working more than ever, with roles in two other movies out this month beside The Wackness (Elegy and The Love Guru) and more to come, including the trainbound thriller Transsiberian, the comic satire War, Inc and Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island with Leonardo DiCaprio. Kingsley maintains that it's his inner peace, rather than anything connected with Sexy Beast, that has made him so in demand. \"Three or four years ago, I realized there was a demon I needed to be face to face with, so that I could say: 'You can go now. Thank you. You can go.' I felt this shift. Something had been clinging on. Some demon was sitting over me with a knife and fork, ready to eat me every day.\" He won't tell me what the demon was, only what it wasn't: \"It wasn't substances,\" he smiles. Did the demons leaving coincide with him meeting Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro, who became his fourth wife? \"The other way around. The demons left. Then the happiness came.\" Can he tell the difference between his work before the demons left, and now? \"I'm surprised I can't. Because I know I'm warmer, more embracing. I find my emotional triggers are closer to the surface, easier to reach. I don't have to dig too deep between 'action' and 'cut.' It's right there.\" He's jabbing at his chest with an insistent finger, and grinning madly. The Wackness is released 29 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
