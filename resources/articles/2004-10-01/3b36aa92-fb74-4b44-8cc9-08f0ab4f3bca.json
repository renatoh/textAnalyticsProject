The 31-year-old batsman, out of action since the Asia Cup final in August because of tennis elbow, has also been complaining of muscle weakness. \"He will have to undergo a fitness test two days before the match. If he's declared fit, he will play,\" Karunakaran Nair, secretary of the Indian cricket board, said yesterday. \"We're optimistic about his chances.\" Tendulkar trained with the Indian squad until last week before returning home to Bombay for treatment. He was named on Monday in a 15-player squad for the third Test of the four-match series which Australia lead 1-0. Australia's injured captain Ricky Ponting is hoping to return for the final Test next month. \"Today's x-rays confirmed that his thumb is healing well,\" a statement from Cricket Australia said yesterday. The 29-year-old batsman fractured his left thumb while fielding at slip during last month's ICC Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by England. Ponting said in Sydney he was not certain he would be passed fit for the fourth Test. \"But with the way things have proceeded over the last few days there is certainly a high chance of that happening,\" he said, adding that, if the injury had been to the bottom-hand thumb, \"they might have been able to target me. But I don't mind them trying to bowl a few short balls on those wickets over there.\" Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya needs 36 runs in the series against Pakistan, which begins today in Faisalabad, to become the second player from his country to score 6,000 Test runs. That seems a foregone conclusion given that the 35-year-old left-hander has scored two hundreds and four fifties in his last 12 Test appearances. \"He is not in the team just because he is a senior player. He is there because he is a match winner for us,\" Sri Lanka's captain Marvan Atapattu said. However Jayasuriya will have to recapture his Test form after managing a top score of only 40 during the recent one-day tri-series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe, \"Every player goes through a bad patch but he has contributed a lot and he will be very important for us in these conditions,\" said Atapattu, who was criticised by Sri Lanka's chief selector Asantha De Mel last week for not picking younger players. \"Team development should go hand in hand with success. As captain my job is to do the best with the team given by the selectors,\" Atapattu said in response to the comments. \"My mission is to see Sri Lanka reach the top of the ratings in Test and one-day internationals.\" The skipper called for more discipline from his bowlers in the absence of the off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, will meet with representatives of Zimbabwe's rebel players this morning before deciding whether to get involved in their dispute with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. Bevan, who is in Zimbabwe as part of an England and Wales Cricket Board panel to assess safety and security in the run-up to next month's controversial tour by England, will meet Stuart Carlisle and Trevor Gripper at the rebels' request. Bevan is likely to ask the rebels for their response to the International Cricket Council's finding that there was no racism in Zimbabwean cricket and whether they want to continue with the ICC's \"alternative dispute resolution\" process to try to resolve their issues with the ZCU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
