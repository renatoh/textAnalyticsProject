In an ingeniously programmed weekend, the dedicated listener could hear 15 acts in 50 hours, with at least a dozen different ideas of what the word \"jazz\" might mean. The 20-piece Jazz Jamaica All Stars kicked off to a jam-packed house on Friday. With clever arrangements of reggae classics (Liquidator, Al Capone) and reggae treatments of jazz standards (Dolphin Dance, Footprints), this was a crowd-pleaser that didn't short-change the jazz fans. Star vocalist Juliet Roberts swept on stage to sing Again (fusing lovers' rock and old-style big band in a fruity hybrid), My Boy Lollipop and Bob Marley's One Drop. The audience yelled their pleasure. Saturday afternoon began at the Pavilion with the ultra-restrained Martin Speake Quartet and the ultra-brittle Guus Janssen Quartet. By refreshing contrast, violinist Mark Feldman and saxophonist Wolfgang Pushnig created a soundworld that was complex, delicate and full of rhythmic propulsion. Meanwhile, at the Guildhall, Ben Davis (cello) and Chris Biscoe (alto sax and alto clarinet) played nicely off-centre versions of Caravan and Ruby My Dear and beguiling originals by Davis. The practicalities of moving between venues meant listeners often arrived late and got up to leave before the end of sets, but Huw Warren's rapt audience didn't budge, staying right to the end of a solo piano set that included a 5/4 boogie-woogie version of Charlie Parker's Moose the Mooche and a bravura 30-minute improvisation based on John Dowland's Lachrymae. Sunday started with a jazz-folk collaboration, featuring trombonist Annie Whitehead's band plus concertina player Alistair Anderson and fiddler Chris Stout, which produced yearning melodies and gentle funk that almost drifted into tango territory. The Dresch Quintet, from Hungary, also incorporated \"non-jazz\" instruments: the exuberant, splintery cimbalon of Kelman Balogh and the melancholy shepherd's pipe of saxophonist Mihaly Dresch. Another impressive Hungarian, Gyorgy Szabados, made his UK debut at the Guildhall with an intense and assured solo piano performance. Earlier, saxophonist Tommy Smith had played solo a Scottish tone poem accompanied by an hour- long backing track and a flightcase full of technology. The Billy Jenkins Blues Collective, making their \"festival debut\", were in their element. What with non-stop jokes, you might forget that some of Jenkins's numbers, such as Badlands and The Duke and Me, are genuinely good songs. Their deliberate silliness was a useful counterweight to the underwhelming over-seriousness later that night of drummer Peter Erskine with The Creative Jazz Orchestra. The most impressive performers of the festival were the masterful Louis Sclavis quintet, whose demanding arrangements, fiery improvisations and thoroughly contemporary approach to sound and rhythm were breathtaking. Cellist Vincent Courtois, bassist Bruno Chevillon and drummer Francois Merville provided a rich and polyrhythmic spine to numbers such as Contre . . . Contre and Hommage \u00e0 Lounes Matoub. Sclavis returned on Sunday evening to play an intense and demanding duo with legendary US saxophonist David Murray, who played a brilliant solo version of Body and Soul, swaying restlessly around the microphone. The crowd concentrated as closely as ever. The festival takes its listeners seriously, and they return the compliment."}, "isHosted": false}}}
