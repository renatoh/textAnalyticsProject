The company has partnered with Texas Tech University (TTU) and the Valencia-based fabric mill Tejidos Royo to create a foam-dyed, water-free process, eliminating the waste generated from the traditional dyeing processes. To put this in perspective, the usual way to dye denim that traditional James Dean blue uses a repetitive dip-and-dry method to transfer indigo on to yarn. Multiple vats of water \u2013 up to 12, each containing thousands of litres of water \u2013 are used and then discarded. By the time they reach a shop, one pair of jeans can have used gallons of water. The new process, Indigood, eliminates the need for \u201creduction\u201d chemicals and instead uses a foaming agent. The indigo dye is transferred on to yarns in an oxygen-deprived environment sealed by a nitrogen hood. Roian Atwood, the senior director of global sustainable business at the parent company Kontoor Brands, describes it as \u201can elegant one-process step\u201d that \u201cremoves 100% of water from the dye process\u201d as well as reducing energy and waste by 60% each. The technology has been in development for a decade, but achieving the depth of colour for indigo denim has only been achieved in the past three years. \u201cWe want this to be adopted by as many brands as possible because it transforms our industry,\u201d says Atwood. While water is still required to grow the cotton yarn in the first place, the brand says it has partnered with several organisations \u2013 including the Soil Health Institute and Cotton Connect \u2013 to help farmers adopt best practices. The pieces in its first collection using the technology are made from up to 30% recycled cotton. It is a case, says Atwood, of not waiting to be 100%, but to take small steps. \u201cSustainability is a journey to making improvement \u2013 you can have a small initiative that is seen as a key priority,\u201d he says. While initially used for the brand\u2019s autumn/winter 2019 Icons collection, priced between \u00a380 and \u00a3130, the technology will be rolled out across the brand\u2019s cheaper ranges so that \u201csustainable products aren\u2019t a choice between basic needs and doing the right thing\u201d, says Atwood. There are also plans for Lee Jeans, also owned by Kontoor, to release Indigood collections later this year. The announcement comes as the fashion industry is having a major reassessment of processes throughout the often complex supply chain after intense scrutiny of past exploitation and polluting practices. Atwood says that Wrangler conforms to the \u201cbuy less, buy better\u201d school of thought. \u201cWe will have to clothe ourselves, but at the same time be mindful of how we do that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fashion industry must do far more to reduce its huge environmental impact \u2013 which includes vast water usage and chemical and micro-plastic pollution,\u201d says Emma Priestland, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. \u201cInnovation and new technology have an important role to play \u2013 and it\u2019s encouraging to see a number of firms looking for ways to reduce their eco-footprint, but we also need government intervention to ensure that the whole industry reduces its impact on the environment. We can all play our part too by rejecting the fast-fashion, throwaway culture and the damage, pollution and waste it causes.\u201d Atwood says that \u201cdurability is by far the No 1 sustainable tenet\u201d when it comes to being a retailer. \u201cIf you have a jean jacket for 30 years, that\u2019s a real testament to its construction. If something blows out in eight months, it increases the need for continuous consumption. At the same time we have to mitigate the very real impacts happening up and down the supply chain.\u201d This has to be done \u201cat an urgent rate in order to meet the global imperative \u2013 from climate crisis to lack of biodiversity and good workplace standards to the international manufacturing community\u201d, says Atwood. \u201cThere is a way in this resource revolution to make products with far fewer impacts; that is what [Indigood] represents. To take the water footprint in dyeing and take it down to zero is the type of technology upheaval we need.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 July 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Indigood process using \u201cchemical-free soap\u201d. This has been corrected to say that the process eliminates the need for \u201creduction\u201d chemicals and instead uses a foaming agent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
