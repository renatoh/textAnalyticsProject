A spokesman for the Guardia Civil said the man was arrested on Tuesday after his plane landed at the Andaluc\u00edan airport. \u201cThe serviceman was travelling on a military plane that had flown in from Brazil and stopped over at Seville airport en route to Tokyo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe serviceman was found to have cocaine in his hand baggage that weighed a total of 39kg. He was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and is currently in custody at our Seville headquarters waiting to appear before a judge.\u201d It is understood the plane was carrying a military delegation tasked with protecting the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, during the summit in the Japanese capital. Bolsonaro confirmed the news in a statement on Tuesday night, saying he had been informed of the airman\u2019s arrest by the defence minister. \u201cI immediately ordered the defence minister to cooperate with Spanish police to establish the facts and cooperate with every stage of the investigation, and to launch an investigation by the military police,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are around 300,000 men and women in the armed forces who are trained to uphold the highest principles of ethics and morality. If the airman is found to have committed a crime, he will be tried and convicted according to the law.\u201d Leaders are due to gather in Osaka on Friday and Saturday as Japan hosts its first G20 summit. As well as the main gathering, there will be meetings between finance ministers, central bank governors and foreign ministers. Earlier this month, Bolsonaro enacted drug policy designed to toughen penalties for traffickers and require users to undergo rehabilitation at private or religious centres. The new rules raise the minimum prison sentence for traffickers who lead criminal organisations from five to eight years. In addition, they reinforce the role of therapeutic communities. Specialists have argued the legislation moves Brazil in the opposite direction of many countries that try to approach addiction as a health issue. Drug users in the country previously had to agree to hospital admission, but the law now allows involuntary rehabilitation upon the recommendation of a relative or public health official.
