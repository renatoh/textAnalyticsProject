The IMF stands ready to work with the Greek authorities and the European partners to help move this important effort forward.\u201d And finally, here\u2019s our news story on the political fight ahead: Alexis Tsipras was on course on Monday night to sway radical-leftist Syriza MPs to accept the most draconian rescue of a sovereign nation since the second world war after the Greek prime minister accepted a third bailout programme that one analyst said came after a weekend of \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d. Tsipras, locked in fraught negotiations with EU leaders in Brussels until Monday morning, indicated that he would carry the Athens parliament, despite some defections, in a vote on the package by Wednesday. Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outlined deal, Tsipras summoned his closest allies to a meeting in Athens before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday. Likening the deal to the 1919 Versailles treaty \u2013 widely seen as the harbinger of the second world war for its crushing of Weimar Germany \u2013 the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis called it both \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201cuntenable\u201d. \u201cThis has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greeceback on the rails towards recovery,\u201d he told Australia\u2019s public broadcaster, the ABC. \u201cThis is a new Versailles treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] knows it. He knows he\u2019s damned if he does and he\u2019s damned if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full story: And here\u2019s a thought to ponder: And that\u2019s a good time to stop. Back tomorrow, for more coverage of the Greek crisis. Goodnight! GW Some late breaking news. Greece has missed another payment to the International Monetary Fund today, worth around \u20ac450m. That\u2019s on top of the \u20ac1.6bn payment missed on 30 June, putting the Greek government deeper into arrears. Not a great way to mark today\u2019s bailout deal -- but a reminder of Greece\u2019s financial plight. Spokesman Gerry Rice says: \u201cThe SDR 360 million principal repayment (about \u20ac456 million) due by Greece to the IMF today was not received. We have informed our Executive Board of this development. Greece\u2019s arrears to the IMF total SDR 1.6 billion (about \u20ac2.0bn) to date. \u201cThe request by the Greek authorities for an extension of the repayment obligation due on June 30th is expected to be discussed by the Executive Board in the coming weeks.\u201d (SDR=special drawing reserves) The FT focuses on the political challenge facing Alexis Tsipras, with some Syriza considering mutiny. The Telegraph reckons the UK\u2019s bill for the third Greek bailout could be \u00a31bn, if George Osborne can\u2019t thwart it: Here come tomorrow\u2019s newspapers.... And The Times reports that Britain could pay \u00a3850m into the Greek bailout (although, as we wrote earlier, the UK is fighting this) A couple more photos from tonight\u2019s anti-austerity demonstration in Athens - apart from the flag-burning, it looks fairly subdued. We\u2019ve asked eight experts to give their view of the bailout deal, including former Belgium PM Guy Verhofstadt, Irish economist Dan O\u2019Brien, and Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis. Another opinion poll from Germany, showing that the \u201cmental waterboarding\u201d and \u201ccrucifying\u201d of Alexis Tsipras wasn\u2019t received too badly back home. Writing in the Guardian tonight, Paul Mason puts his finger one one of the causes behind Europe\u2019s debt crisis: It is the eurozone\u2019s inability to contain the democratic wishes of 19 electorates. When the Finnish government threatened to collapse the talks, it was only expressing the wishes of the 38% of voters who backed the nationalist rightwingers of Finns Party. Likewise, when Sch\u00e4uble sprang his temporary Grexit plan, he was expressing the demand of 52% of German voters, who want Greece to leave. As for the Greeks, having tramped the streets of Athens alongside them for the best part of two months, I am certain that the \u201cOxi\u201d movement was essentially a demand to stay in the Euro on different terms. You cannot get 70-80% of people in the working-class suburbs of Athens turning out \u2013 in the face of a rightwing media bombardment \u2013 on far-left anti-Euro sentiment alone. Another German opinion poll, showing that Berlin\u2019s hardline performance in Brussels has played well back home: Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, had second thoughts today about a tweet comparing Syriza\u2019s election victory to the Arab Spring uprising (it\u2019s been deleted) The New York stock market just closed at a two-week high, as US traders welcomed the overnight breakthrough in Brussels. Despite the hurdles to come, the Dow Jones index jumped 217 points or 1.2% to 17,977. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at currency trading firm OANDA, said: Markets have responded very positively to the news, which comes following months of uncertainty and increasing fears that Greece could suffer a messy exit from the euro zone.\u201d A small majority of Germans are happy with the terms of the deal hammered out with Greece, even though most don\u2019t trust Athens to enforce it. That\u2019s according to a poll for news magazine Spiegel Online, which also found that a third of Germans still expect Grexit eventually. Wednesday is going to be a dramatic day. One of Greece\u2019s main unions have called a 24-hour strike, in protest against the economic reforms which the Athens parliament will vote through that day. Their union, Adedy, called the stoppage tonight, saying it was against the agreement with the eurozone. They are also planning a demonstration outside parliament. I *think* this is the first 24-hour strike called by unions since January\u2019s election. Another milestone for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s premiership. News of the last-ditch Brussels breakthrough has been welcomed in America, where the government had been making increasingly anxious noises in recent weeks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the deal a \u201ccredible step\u201d that would include difficult structural reforms by Greece, Reuters says. Deutsche Bank analysts reckon Greece\u2019s capital controls won\u2019t be lifted until autumn. They told clients tonight that the European Central Bank is unlikely to cut Greece much slack until the third bailout is agreed. We suspect the ECB will stall an ELA decision until Greece begins to legislate the new deal later this week. Greece would still face a tight ELA cap, however. We expect the ELA cap will remain carefully calibrated and controlled at least until the new ESM loan is fully in place. Access to banks could be fully normalised only in the fall. Many Greeks may feel better about the new bailout deal once their banks reopen and capital controls are lifted. That feels some way away tonight. But economy minister George Stathakis has pledged that savers\u2019 deposits are safe (those that haven\u2019t been removed and stuffed under the mattress already) The bailout include \u20ac25bn to recapitalise the stricken banking sector, through the highly contentious \u20ac50bn asset sale plan. Stathakis told ERT that: \u201cThe recapitalisation is so secure that it fully safeguards deposits\u201d A group of leftist protesters gathered outside the Athens parliament tonight, to urge MPs to reject the bailout plan. Judging by the photos we\u2019ve seen, it was a fairly small demo: One lady enlivened proceedings (and attracted a lot of photographers) by burning a Syriza flag. My colleague Phillip Inman reports on another potential stumbling block that has emerged following this morning\u2019s deal and in particular the plans to come up with a bridging loan to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. All the EU\u2019s 28 nations are expected to be asked to contribute towards a \u00a310bn-\u00a312bn bridging loan. However, UK chancellor George Osborne immediately rejected the idea, according to Treasury officials who said that Brussels was told the \u00a31bn of UK funds in the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism should not be used for eurozone bailouts, in accordance with a 2010 agreement. In the wake of this morning\u2019s potential deal to keep Greece in the eurozone and allow it to tap a third bailout, the credit ratings agencies have been commenting on the country\u2019s economic prospects and the outlook for its credit score. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has told Reuters news agency that it could upgrade Greece\u2019s credit rating \u201cpretty quickly\u201d if a plan for a third bailout seems solid. Moody\u2019s, however, says that Greece\u2019s rock-bottom credit rating was unlikely to be raised any time soon. Fitch meanwhile comments that today\u2019s agreement may ease the Greece\u2019s \u201cextreme liquidity pressure and raises the possibility of a third bail-out programme, but substantial near-term and long-term challenges to the sovereign\u2019s creditworthiness remain\u201d. As European leaders digest the tough new deal set out for Greece, our reporter Jennifer Rankin sums up the day after the longest of nights in Brussels and looks at what comes next: European leaders lined up to say Grexit has been averted, but this snappy soundbite glides over the fact the eurozone has simply agreed to open negotiations on an \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn) bailout. Although this is a step to shoring-up confidence in the euro, it is only a promise to have more talks with no guarantee of success. Talks on the bailout plan are forecast to last around four weeks. \u201cWe know time is critical for Greece, but there are no shortcuts,\u201d said Klaus Regling, the official in charge of the the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s permanent bailout fund that Greece hopes to tap. But these formal talks can only begin, if eurozone leaders avoid several political and financial tripwires. The Greek government has until the end of Wednesday to ensure that sweeping reforms to its pension system and VAT rates are written into law. If Greek lawmakers meet this eurozone-imposed deadline, the baton will pass to the creditors. At least five countries, including Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, will have to put the idea of opening negotiations on a bailout to a parliamentary vote. Politics could be overtaken by financial deadlines. Athens faces demands to repay \u20ac7bn of debts in July, including \u20ac3.5bn due to the European Central Bank on Monday (20 July). Eurozone officials are working round the clock to come up with emergency funds that will help Greece bridge the gap before a permanent bailout kicks in. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the hawkish Dutch politician, who was re-elected chair of the eurozone group of finance ministers on Monday. Several options were being discussed on bridge finance, but no one had found \u201cthe golden key to solve the problem\u201d, he said, although he hopes to see progress by Wednesday. And here again, is Jennifer\u2019s very handy guide to key events ahead: If you are just joining us, here is a brief summary of the latest events in the Greek debt crisis. After almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc. It\u2019s a deal that will force Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to compromise on what had previously been red lines for his negotiation time. The swathe of austerity measures and reforms affect pensions, VAT, the size of Greece\u2019s public administration and require the country to go back to the IMF for help next year. We have been through the statement and explained the key points here. The deal stipulated talks would begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. This afternoon, fresh from being re-elected as president of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem said described such financing as complex and said \u201cit\u2019s not going to be easy\u201d Tsipras is now back in Athens and has got straight down to business holding an emergency meeting of top officials following the announcement of the deal Germany has faced criticism of its approach to Greece\u2019s debt mountain and this weekend\u2019s talks, sparking a Twitter trend under the hashtag #ThisIsACoup The IMF says it stands \u201cready to work\u201d with Greece and its European partners Former Greek finance minister has dubbed the bailout deal \u201cthe politics of humiliation\u201d. Speaking to Australian radio station ABC, he said Tsipras knows that this is an \u201cimpossible deal...a deal that is simply not viable.\u201d In a separate interview with the New Statesman he has opened up about five months of tense talks with Greece\u2019s creditors. European stock markets have rallied on the news of a tentative deal with banking stocks providing much of the upward momentum. Our main story tonight: After a fraught weekend with his eurozone counterparts in Brussels, Alexis Tsipras is now heading for a showdown with his own party and opposition MPs after accepting a third bailout programme that will bring further austerity to the debt-stricken country. Tsipras convened a meeting of government officials in Athens to thrash out a way to convince his radical-leftist Syriza party and its coalition partner to vote through the package by Wednesday. Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outline deal, Tsipras summoned his finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, and Nikos Filis, representative of the Syriza parliamentary group, to the Athens meeting, before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday. Efforts to win the vote in the national parliament came after Tsipras and Greece\u2019s creditors agreed on the basis for talks on a bailout that will keep the country in the eurozone. The full story from Phillip Inman in London and Jennifer Rankin in Brussels: Former Labour MP Denis MacShane says he is hearing from political contacts in Athens that Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has the votes he needs to get a deal through now he is home from those exhausting talks in Brussels. He is referring to a wide-ranging interview former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has given to the New Statesman here. (Note the interview with the New Statesman\u2019s Harry Lambert is the first since Varoufakis stepped down as finance minister and was conducted last week, before this latest deal was drawn up over the weekend.) Varoufakis tells Lambert about five months of stalled debt crisis talks, that the Eurogroup is \u201ccompletely and utterly\u201d controlled by Germany and that in his view \u201cwe were set up\u201d. The New Statesman also provides the full interview text here. And from the man himself: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been going through the details of this morning\u2019s deal and concludes it will deepen the country\u2019s recession, make its debt position less sustainable and that it \u201cvirtually guarantees that its problems come bubbling back to the surface before too long.\u201d He continues: One line in the seven-page euro summit statement sums up the thinking behind this act of folly, the one that talks about \u201cquasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets\u201d. Translated into everyday English, what this means is that leaving to one side the interest payments on its debt, Greece will have to raise more in revenues than the government spends each and every year. If the performance of the economy is not strong enough to meet these targets, the \u201cquasi-automatic\u201d spending cuts will kick in. If Greece is in a hole, the rest of the euro zone will hand it a spade and tell it to keep digging. This approach to the public finances went out of fashion during the 1930s but is now back. Most modern governments operate what are known as \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d, under which they run bigger deficits (or smaller surpluses) in bad times because it is accepted that raising taxes or cutting spending during a recession reduces demand and so makes the recession worse. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: That\u2019s it from the eurogroup press conference in Brussels. Newly re-elected head of the group, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, came back to bridging finance at the close of the briefing. Note that this morning\u2019s deal stipulated talks would begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. Greece must repay more than \u20ac7bn to the European Central Bank (ECB) in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over. While his colleagues are briefing the press on their Eurogroup meeting, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr has turned to Twitter to get something off his chest: We already know from the statement this morning out of the leaders\u2019 marathon summit that Greece is being prevailed upon to request continued International Monetary Fund support from March 2016. A loss for Tsipras, who had reportedly resisted further IMF involvement in Greece\u2019s rescue. From Brussels we now have more details from Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, on the IMF\u2019s role in a new bailout. More from Moscovici from Jennifer Rankin who is at the Brussels press conference for us. Moscovici finishes with a few words of praise for the reporters working through last night in Brussels. Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic affairs, is now speaking at the press conference following the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. He wants everyone to take a moment to congratulate themselves: Integrity of eurozone reaffirmed, goal reached, congratulations in order, he says. Dijsselbloem also says he expects talsk on Greece\u2019s third bailout to take four rather than two weeks. On bridge financing, the Eurogroup of finance ministers has asked experts to look into how it would work and \u201cit is very complex\u201d, adds the Eurogroup head. Looking ahead, he says there may be a Eurogroup conference call on Wednesday or Thursday after a Greek parliament vote on the new reform demands. Dijsselbloem is now speaking to reporters at a press conference in Brussels. Jennifer Rankin is there. Sticking with the Eurogroup, its meeting this afternoon has now concluded and a press conference is about to start. You can follow it online, as the newly re-elected president points out: A bit more detail on that re-election of Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers from the single currency bloc. After seeing off his only challenger, Spain\u2019s centre-right Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, Dijsselbloem will serve another two-and-a-half year term. In a statement, EU officials add: \u201cThis decision was unanimously supported by all Eurogroup members.\u201d Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been re-elected president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Reuters and others report. An item for your diaries if you would like to hear what a panel of UK-based experts thinks about this tentative Greek deal. On Wednesday 15 July at 10.15am BST, the UK\u2019s House of Lords committee dealing with EU financial affairs will be putting questions on reforms, the Greek referendum, the Greek banking system, implications for the UK and more to experts including professor Charles Goodhart from the LSE, professor Richard Portes from London Business School and Roger Bootle, economist and head of the thinktank Capital Economics. It will be streamed live on www.parliamentlive.tv and available to watch there after the event. And while we are on diaries, our reporter Jennifer Rankin has compiled this very handy guide to what happens next: The International Monetary Fund has put out a short statement following this morning\u2019s euro summit statement and the weekend crisis talks, attended by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Gerry Rice, IMF director of communications says: \u201cFollowing on the managing director\u2019s participation in the discussions on Greece held in Brussels over the weekend, she briefed the IMF\u2019s executive board on the outcome as reflected in the eurozone leaders\u2019 statement published earlier today. The IMF stands ready to work with the Greek authorities and the European partners to help move this important effort forward.\u201d Over in Athens the Greek prime minister has got straight down to business holding an emergency meeting of top officials following the announcement of the deal. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Alexis Tsipras has wasted no time since his arrival back in Athens at 4 PM local time. The leader, according to aides, has convened an emergency meeting of top government officials, including finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his Syriza party\u2019s parliamentary representative Nikos Filis. The inclusion of Filis, who earlier today said cadres disagreeing with the new measures should immediately resign, suggests that the meeting will focus on how to deal with party dissidents. The energy minister, who heads Syriza\u2019s hardline Far Left faction, the parliament speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou and the former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis have all spoken out against the policies Tsipras has signed up to. The leader will then meet Panos Kammenos, the defence minister who heads the coalition\u2019s junior partner, the right wing Independent Greeks party. Kammenos, a rapid opponent of austerity, is acutely aware that his party would be routed if fresh elections are held. On learning of the deal he reacted by immediately uploading a picture of a weeping woman on his twitter account under the words: \u201cOnly if we face fate standing upright do we kill death.\u201d In a subsequent tweet he said: \u201cDon\u2019t rush to any conclusions, nothing is a given.\u201d Political developments in Athens; Alexis Tsipras has returned the Greek capital and started meeting ministers. More on this shortly The Economist Intelligence Unit warns that Greece\u2019s membership of the euro isn\u2019t guaranteed: Gone but not forgotten. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has dubbed the bailout deal \u201cthe politics of humiliation\u201d. Speaking to Australian radio station ABC, he said Alexis Tsipras knows that this is an \u201cimpossible deal...a deal that is simply not viable.\u201d Greece\u2019s lenders, he added, were taking revenge on Alexis Tsipras: \u2018The troika have made sure that they will make him eat every single word that he uttered in criticism of the troika over the last five years. Not just these six months we\u2019ve been in government, but in the five years prior to that. \u2018This has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece back on the rails towards recovery. This is a new Versailles Treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister knows it. He knows that he\u2019s damned if he does and he\u2019s damned if he doesn\u2019t.\u2019 He also laid into the \u20ac50bn of Greek asset sales demanded by Europe. In the [1967] coup d\u2019\u00e9tat the choice of weapon used in order to bring down democracy then was the tanks. Well, this time it was the banks. And Varoufakis also reiterated his claim that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wanted to force Greece out of the eurozone to frighten France and Italy. Sch\u00e4uble considers Grexit to be \u201cessential for his plan for Europe\u201d.... One that is not a federation, but on the capacity of a single fiscal overlord to veto national budgets and therefore to annul national sovereignty. You can hear the interview here. And here\u2019s a reminder of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s political vulnerability: Eurozone crisis veterans looking for a day off should check this calendar: August looks pretty free :) Pierre Moscovici, perhaps the most optimistic voice around the Greek crisis this year, is striking a cautious note this afternoon: Analysts at Deutsche Bank sum up the agreement: One of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s few triumphs last night was ensuring that the fund that will sell off \u20ac50bn of Greek assets will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg. But analysts are now questioning whether this plan is really viable at all. Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital argues that it\u2019s not: The amount, \u20ac50bn, is in line with an IMF projection of value of potential Greek privatisations made by the IMF in 2011. Now I just might take a guess that the value of those assets have decreased somewhat since that date. How much by? Impossible for me to even speculate, but as a starting point how much is the Greek stock market down since then? 40%? Oh and so far they have raised approx. \u20ac3.2bn. The income that these assets currently generate flow through to the Greek government. Diverting them for other purposes only reduces Greek government income so it is kinda like robbing Peter to pay Paul. The privatisation fund will take time to set up. But the banks need the \u20ac25bn as soon as possible for recapitalisation purposes. Oh and guess what assets contributed to that initial valuation? Banks\u2026 Perhaps the best line about the privatisation fund though comes from Mr Tsipras, who proudly stated that he had kept Greek assets from going abroad. In the sense that the admin will be situated in Greece. If he had signed the deal on offer just a few short weeks ago there wouldn\u2019t have been any such segregated fund. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser of German financial services group Allianz, wasn\u2019t impressed with how events played out in Brussels either: Debt campaigners are deeply disappointed (although probably not surprised) that Greece is receiving more bailout loans, rather than substantial debt relief now. Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says this will simply extend the five-year Greek debt crisis for at least another decade. \u201cAt the heart of it is a lie from Eurozone leaders that \u2018nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken\u2019. They can, they should and they must. Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America suffered from 20 years of economic stagnation and increasing poverty in the 1980s and 1990s because of a refusal to cancel debt and the imposition of austerity overriding democracy. The same now awaits Greece and the Eurozone unless there is a sudden change of direction. Last night, Greece was threatened with the \u2018offer\u2019 of a temporary exit from the eurozone, if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached. And although that \u201ctime-out\u201d didn\u2019t survive to the final statement, it highlights the damage caused to the European project this year: The call went out on Sunday afternoon. \u201cHi guys, this is an important message about Greece,\u201d wrote an activist named Francesca in a text message to 40 people, including members of Spain\u2019s Indignado movement and leftist coalition party Barcelona en Com\u00fa. She continued: \u201cThese guys meeting now in the Eurogroup, they all have twitter handles, they deserve to be told by the world to do a deal with Tsipras and stop trying to overthrow him,\u201d Minutes later, the hashtag #ThisIsACoup was born in Barcelona. It quickly shot to the top of trending lists around the world, including Germany and Greece, sparking a social media backlash against Germany and its finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, over the draconian list of demands being forced on the Greek government in return for a third bailout. The hashtag was first attributed to a physics teacher in Barcelona, who clarified on Monday that it was a collective campaign. Shortly after, those behind the campaign published a declaration, explaining their motivations. \u201c#ThisIsACoup may have started in Barcelona, but it resonated around the world because it expressed a common sense of impotence of citizens in the face of globalised financial powers,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe decided to support Francesca\u2019s call to launch an online campaign to support the democratic will of the Greek people in the face of extortion by the EuroGroup in its negotiations with Syriza,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe scandalous Eurogroup proposals yesterday made last night the ideal moment to create a hashtag to express and, above all, coordinate, our outrage at the extortion the Greek government and its people were being subject to.\u201d The hashtag was a nod to the Egyptian hashtag #NotACoup, that trended in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to mobilise online from our counterparts of the Arab Spring and from our own experiences of occupying the squares of Spain.\u201d Yanis Balafas, a Syriza lawmaker close to Alexis Tsipras, has also warned that the government could split badly over the deal. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThere\u2019s a vista of division within the party, part of Syriza officials and lawmakers do not accept the tactics followed by our prime minister.\u201d But right now, the important thing is that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of Greece defaulting has been averted. The main threat of a mutiny comes from Syriza\u2019s hard-line wing, the Left Platform. And there are already signs that they are unwilling to swallow the bailout deal. Enikos, the Greek news site, explains: The new bailout agreement signed by Alexis Tsipras is a humiliation for Greece, says an editorial in Iskra website which reflects the views of Syriza\u2019s hardliners. The article says that the agreement reestablishes and extends the guardianship of the Troika and seals \u201csocial enslavement\u201d. It maintains the country\u2019s colonial status under German tutelage of the EU, it notes. \u201cThe Greek people must not become disappointed, on the contrary it must remain stubborn, as it did in the referendum and the countrywide protests for a \u2018No\u2019 to the very end. A \u2018No\u2019 to clash with the bailout, neo-liberalism and austerity which are institutionalized in the euro zone.\u201d Panagiotis Lafazanis, the head of the Left Platform, abstained in last Friday\u2019s vote on whether to accept the initial austerity deal, and could now be reshuffled. Analysts at Eurasia Group suspect Greece could soon head towards a national unity government, if many government MPs refuse to back the bailout deal on Wednesday night. If Tsipras loses his majority and potentially even more support than he did on Saturday, it makes no sense for him to try and reshuffle the government. In this case, he will instead likely choose to offer his and the support of the remaining Syriza MP\u2019s towards a special purpose national unity government, but one which he will not head. And that administration would sign off on a third bailout, overseeing some initial implementation, and then probably disband for elections in a few months\u2019 time, \u201cprobably by autumn but certainly before December\u201d. [Tsipras\u2019s coalition has 162 seats in the 300-seat parliament. But, at Friday night\u2019s vote to approve negotiations eight MPs abstained, two voted no, and seven were absent]. The Financial Times has some tantalising details of how last night\u2019s marathon summit nearly collapsed around dawn today: They report: Alexis Tsipras of Greece and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, decided after 14 hours of anguished talks that they had reached a dead end. With no room for compromise, neither saw any reason to carry on. Grexit was the only realistic option As the two leaders made for the door it was Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, who moved to prevent the fatigue and frustration from triggering a historic rupture for the eurozone. \u201cSorry, but there is no way you are leaving this room,\u201d the former Polish prime minister said. The dispute centred on the plan to put \u20ac50bn of Greek assets in a new fund. Merkel wanted it all used for debt repayment; Tsipras wanted a smaller fund, devoted to funding investment, to avoid national humiliation. In the end, they fudged it - with half used to recapitalise the banks and the other half split between debt repayments and investment. And as officials staggered into the morning light, they agreed that the Greek PM had come off worst: \u201cThey crucified Tsipras in there,\u201d a senior eurozone official who had attended the summit remarked. \u201cCrucified.\u201d That is on top of the \u2018mental waterboarding\u2019 which officials described to Ian Traynor last night. French prime minister Manuel Valls said the French parliament would vote on the Greek deal on Wednesday. Valls added he was \u201cproud\u201d of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s role in the agreement. \u201cFran\u00e7ois Hollande rose to the historic occasion,\u201d he told BFM-TV. \u201cI am proud to be at the side of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and to succeed today what just a week ago seemed impossible. It\u2019s a victory for Europe.\u201d At a press conference after the deal was announced Hollande told journalists it was \u201can historic occasion\u201d. \u201cWhat I wanted was not just in the interests of Greece, it was in the interestS of Europe and of France. France\u2019s own interests are not separate from those of Europe. France has a special role to play, she has to make sure that the process of construction that linked us following the war continues,\u201d the French president said. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to embody a strength: the eurozone, a monetary zone that give stability and growth\u2026France\u2019s role has also been to seek to bring the parties together, to respect the Greek people while also respecting the other eurozone nations. France\u2019s role is to find the right way for the eurozone and for Europe.\u201d The French magazine Capital described the deal as an \u201cagreement delivered by forceps\u2026after endless negotiations\u201d. \u201cThe pill is still a bitter one for Alexis Tsipras\u2019 radical left, which has made the battle against austerity its symbol to the (Greek) electorate,\u201d Capital wrote. Le Parisien added that the deal was possible thanks to the \u201cFrench-German couple\u201d, even though the two countries that form what French commentators call the \u201cmotor of Europe\u201d were having difficulty \u201cspeaking with one voice\u201d over Greece. Both the extreme right and the extreme left lambasted the Greek deal. On the far left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, co-president of the Front de Gauche, described it as \u201cholding a revolver to Greece\u2019s temple\u201d and accused Hollande of being nothing but an \u201csidekick\u201d to Angela Merkel. Florian Philippot of the Front National tweeted: \u201cWe are witnessing the horror of the European Union, we are in the process of saving the euro at any price\u2026nobody is thinking of the Greeks\u2026or the French taxpayers who will be broke after this deal.\u201d Here\u2019s the full seven-page statement released by the European Council this morning, announcing the agreement with Greece. The European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity assistance that has kept Greek banks afloat this year, sources say. That means that it remains capped at \u20ac89bn, so capital controls remain in place and the Greek banks stay shut. Despite the extra austerity and reforms being heaped on Greece, Athens cafe owner Dimitris is mainly relieved that Grexit has been avoided. Dimitris told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed because the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] couldn\u2019t have done anything else. Leaving the euro would have been much worse.\u201d Alexis Tsipras is more likely than not to quit as Greek PM this year, reckons UK bookmakers Ladbrokes. They are offering evens that Tsipras celebrates New Year\u2019s Eve in Maximos Mansion but only 8/11 that he has stepped down. The odds on Grexit this year have also widened, to 6/1 (bet \u20ac1, get \u20ac7 back) If you believe Greece will still be in the euro come 2016, tou have to speculate \u20ac12 to win \u20ac1 profit. This is a \u201ctoxic deal\u201d that will have political consequences in Greece, warned Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence: In the short-term, Tsipras can stagger on, relying on the opposition to win the vote on Wednesday (15 July) and any other immediate vote (22 July) required by the lenders. The Greek PM might even reshuffle his cabinet in an effort to diminish the political weight of the most staunch opponents to the deal. But his authority and grip on the party is set to decline, making it harder for him to contain an almost inevitable rebellion within SYRIZA. In fact, the government\u2019s parliamentary majority is likely to end as soon as Wednesday after the vote on the measures requested by the lenders. At that point, Tsipras will be forced to either reconfigure the current governing arrangement by striking a deal with the mainstream opposition parties or call an early election. A spokeswoman for British prime minister David Cameron has warned that there is more work to do to end the Greek crisis: She told reporters this morning that: \u201cClearly the challenge now will be on delivering on that [deal] and the implementation which lies ahead ... and I don\u2019t think we underestimate the size of that challenge. We are glad an agreement has been reached but there is still more to do.\u201d Newsflash from Berlin: The German parliament is likely to vote on the Greek bailout plan on Friday (assuming it gets through the Athens parliament on Wednesday) Withdrawing his daily allowance of 50 euros from a cashpoint next to the Bank of Greece in Thessaloniki, Spiros Mousionis smiled with relief at the deal. \u201cWe feel much better now,\u201d said the 66-year-old cotton trader, already looking forward to a day when he could take out more money from the bank. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have imagined a Greece outside the European Union and outside the Euro.\u201d The coming austerity would be tough, Mousionis said, but the only option. \u201cI expect it, and I will deal with it. Maybe it\u2019s better for us to have some discipline and order in our society.\u201d A few kilometres away, standing outside his kidswear factory, Konstantinos Chantizaridis said the specifics of the new deal, if passed by parliament, would hit his business hard. They will mean that the owner of any business, however big or small, will have to pay corporation tax a year in advance. \u201cWe already paid 55% tax in advance [details], and now we have to pay 28% more on non-existent income,\u201d Chantizaridis sighed. \u201cBut we have to pay it to support the national economy.\u201d Even after five years of austerity, more financial pain was still the only option, he argued. \u201cWith this deal, we will keep our European passport and open up the banks \u2013 I can\u2019t see any other advantages,\u201d said Chantizaridis, who also doubles as the secretary-general of the Thessaloniki chamber of commerce. \u201cBut at least with this environment, we know more or less what it means. If we\u2019d gone back to the drachma, it would be very different to going back to the drachma we had in 2000. Now the country is not producing anything, and is mostly reliant on service industries like tourism. Leaving the euro would have been very hard.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to get up to speed on the Greek story, check out Jennifer Rankin\u2019s latest news story from Brussels: Over in Greece, the backlash has begun... with a lot of anger being directed at Germany over the extra austerity that will now be heaped on the country. Reuters has a good take: \u201cListen, it is some sort of victory but it is a pyrrhic victory because the measures are very strict,\u201d Marianna, 73, told Reuters on an Athens street. \u201cPeople have suffered the past five years and there is more to come now. This is what makes things difficult for us. We wanted to stay in Europe, it goes without saying that we did. But what about the terms?\u201d Their economy pummelled by years of recession, their banks shut and dozens of businesses closing daily, some Greeks vented their anger on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Newspapers laced the morning\u2019s headlines with references to World War Two and railed against what they see as Berlin\u2019s attempts to humiliate Greece as punishment for its resistance to another round of cuts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage after Greece\u2019s government and its eurozone creditors reached an agreement to pave the way to a third Greek bailout. Here\u2019s the situation: Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms after more than 16 hours of negotiations in Brussels that began on Sunday afternoon and ran through the night. He has agreed to immediately pass laws to further reform the tax and pension system, liberalise the labour market, and open up closed professions. Sunday trading laws will be relaxed, and even milk producers and bakers will be deregulated. The FT has dubbed it: The most intrusive economic supervision programme ever mounted in the EU. Greece was forced to accept these measures after Germany piled intense pressure, as a price for a new deal. EU officials told us that Tsipras was subjected to \u201cmental waterboarding\u201d in closed-door meetings with Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and Francois Hollande. The plan must now be approved by the Athens parliament by Wednesday, and then voted through various national parliaments. If agreement is reached, talks can then begin towards a a new three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn), accompanied by further monitoring by Greece\u2019s creditors. The deal comes after Greece\u2019s five-month battle with its creditors, which has gripped the eurozone, dominated the political agenda and alarmed the markets. Emerging from the summit, Tsipras admitted it had been tough - but insisted he had won concessions on debt relief (sometime in the future) as well as the medium-term funding plan. He also managed to persuade the eurozone that a new investment fund, that will manage and sell off \u20ac50bn Greek assets, would be based in Athens not Luxembourg. But generally, Tsipras appears to have finally capitulated in the face of threats that Greece would be ejected from the eurozone. For the full story details, check out out earlier liveblog of the events in Brussels on Sunday, and Monday morning. Attention now turns to Athens, where Tsipras will arrive home to swirling speculation of cabinet reshuffles, unity governments and even fresh elections. Meanwhile eurozone finance ministers will be meeting in Brussels, for the third day running, to discuss urgently needed bridge financing. We\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction through the day...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
