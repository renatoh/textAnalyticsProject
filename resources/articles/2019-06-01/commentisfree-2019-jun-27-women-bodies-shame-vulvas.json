It\u2019s a ridiculous question, I know, given that more than half of us have them. It\u2019s like asking if bicycles are finally fashionable, or if fingernails are now a thing. But in these supposedly enlightened times, our lady-parts continue to be overlooked, misunderstood, bossed about and violated. Still, it\u2019s been heartening of late to see vulvas (or vaginas, or fannies, or foofs \u2013 let each woman decide what she calls what\u2019s in her pants) discussed more openly, shown off in museums and celebrated on television and in books. This isn\u2019t about the vulva-shaped soaps and cushions flooding gift shops, or Gwyneth Paltrow and her daft vaginal eggs. I\u2019m talking about cultural conversations and artefacts that illuminate and educate us all on matters that, by rights, should be common knowledge. Earlier this year, Channel 4 aired 100 Vaginas, a joyful, taboo-busting documentary in which Laura Dodsworth interviewed 100 women and photographed their vulvas. The series highlighted how little the issues that have most impact on women\u2019s lives, from sexual violence to childbirth, infertility and menopause, are openly discussed. This spring, the pop-up Vagina Museum \u2013 the first of its kind in the world \u2013 opened in Camden, north London, with the hope of breaking the stigma surrounding women\u2019s bodies and sexuality, and has since launched a crowdfunding campaign in order to secure a permanent home. This summer brings a slew of books focused on female anatomy. Hot on the heels of journalist Lynn Enright\u2019s Vagina: A Re-Education, about the shaming women experience in relation to their genitalia, is the release this week of the anti-FGM campaigner Nimko Ali\u2019s What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway), which highlights the stories of women across cultures and continents related to sex, sexual violence, childbirth, menopause and more. Still to come (sorry) is Eleanor Morgan\u2019s Hormonal, which looks at the relationship between our bodies and mental health, and how women\u2019s pain is systematically dismissed, and the broadcaster Emma Barnett\u2019s Period, which seeks to call a halt to the secrecy surrounding our menstrual cycles. Attempts by artists and writers to demystify women\u2019s nether regions aren\u2019t new, of course. It\u2019s more than 20 years since The Vagina Monologues, the play by Eve Ensler that told stories of sex, menstruation, rape and childbirth, and Tracey Emin\u2019s period-stained bed. It\u2019s almost 50 since Our Bodies, Ourselves, which sought empowerment through self-knowledge, and Judy Chicago\u2019s vulva-decorated dinner plates. Conceptual artists\u2019 depictions of female genitalia have been causing uproar for decades, never mind that men have been blithely immortalising their penises via architectural structures since ancient Greece. It\u2019s absurd that women are still fighting to have these conversations, but fight we must. A self-proclaimed pussy-grabber sits in the White House, content to watch women\u2019s rights being rolled back in Alabama. Closer to home, a man who appears unable to answer how many children he\u2019s fathered hopes to move in to No 10, while his rival for the job has spoken of wanting to halve the current abortion limit to 12 weeks. Meanwhile, women are avoiding cervical smears out of shame; the demand for labiaplasty among teenage girls is rising; and the \u201cvaginal hygiene\u201d business is booming, despite being surplus to requirements (one of the many miracles of vaginas is that they are self-cleaning. See how our to-do list just got shorter!). None of this is good for men either, whose knowledge of female genitalia is first gleaned from pornography; when confronted with the real thing, they are often surprised to find something other than the neat, hairless Barbie vulvas they have seen online. But should we really expect men to understand something that we don\u2019t always understand ourselves? What unites the current wave of vulva-related projects is a desire to end the shame, both personal and societal, that surrounds women\u2019s bodies, and to show how little we know and why. In her book, Ali observes that, \u201cit\u2019s not very British to talk about fannies\u201d, while, in Hormonal, Morgan asks: \u201cAt what point should we, like a London cabbie acquiring the \u2018Knowledge\u2019 of London\u2019s back alleys and one-way systems, have acquired the \u2018Knowledge\u2019 of our bodies?\u201d Recently, I was moved to tears by the Brooklyn producer Allison Behringer\u2019s podcast, Bodies, in which she spoke to women trying to unravel their own medical mysteries, from paralysing periods to painful sex, after being failed or ignored by medical professionals. All of which illustrates how women\u2019s bodies continue to be both a political battleground and, often, a mystery to their owners. Women have long talked about these so-called intimate matters, although these exchanges invariably happen in quiet corners, away from polite company. At a time when female experience is finally under the microscope, it\u2019s time to open up these conversations and ask that everyone join in. \u2022 Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
