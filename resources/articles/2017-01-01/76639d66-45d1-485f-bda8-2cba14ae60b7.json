On a hastily arranged trip to the US to reinforce previously weak links with Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, Johnson also declared on Monday that the incoming administration had \u201ca very exciting agenda of change\u201d. Johnson\u2019s claim about the UK\u2019s future status as Washington\u2019s preferred trading partner was a pointed reference to Barack Obama\u2019s warning during the EU referendum campaign that Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a trade deal if it chose Brexit. At the time, the US and EU were trying to complete a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP), but that appears to have no future under the presidency of Donald Trump, who ran on a platform of opposition to multilateral trade deals. After visits to see top aides in Trump Tower in New York and meet members of Congress in Washington, Johnson said: \u201cClearly, the Trump administration-to-be has a very exciting agenda of change. One thing that won\u2019t change, though, is the closeness of the relationship between the US and the UK. \u201cWe are the number two contributor to defence in Nato. We are America\u2019s principal partner in working for global security and, of course, we are great campaigners for free trade. We hear that we are first in line to do a great free trade deal with the United States. So, it\u2019s going to be a very exciting year for both our countries.\u201d The UK foreign secretary\u2019s trip to the US before Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January was aimed at making up a deficit in relations with the new administration \u2013 due in some part to Johnson\u2019s past disparaging remarks about the president-elect, who he once described as \u201cunfit\u201d to hold office in the White House. Following the president-elect\u2019s suggestion that he would back a ban on Muslims entering the US and that parts of London were no-go areas, the foreign secretary said Trump was \u201cclearly out of his mind\u201d and \u201cbetraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. Since Trump\u2019s victory, however, Johnson has described the billionaire as a dealmaker and called for an end to the \u201cwhinge-o-rama\u201d over his victory. Confronted with Trump\u2019s comments about sexually assaulting women, which surfaced in video footage during the election campaign, Theresa May said on Sunday: \u201cI think that\u2019s unacceptable, but in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and has apologised for it.\u201d The British prime minister told Sky News there was more to relations between London and Washington than Trump\u2019s character. \u201cThe relationship that the UK has with the United States is about something much bigger than just the relationship between the two individuals as president and prime minister.\u201d May was speaking as Trump tweeted: In New York, Johnson met Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist and the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, which Bannon once described as a platform for the \u201calt-right\u201d, a group known for white nationalist and antisemitic views. The foreign secretary also met Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who has been acting since the election as his chief foreign policy adviser and a gateway for foreign embassies and governments to Trump himself. Having been late in identifying Kushner as the main diplomatic conduit to the president-elect, the UK is hoping that a pre-inauguration visit from the foreign secretary could solidify the link before the nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is confirmed by the Senate. A British official said the meetings at Trump Tower in New York were \u201cwarm and frank, and covered the full range of foreign policy issues\u201d. \u201cThey acknowledged differences but said that they were ready to work together on those differences,\u201d the official said. On Monday morning, Johnson held an off-the-record discussion with US political pundits about the shape and likely policies of a Trump administration. In the afternoon Johnson was due to meet Bob Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, and his Democratic counterpart, Ben Cardin, as well as the majority leader, Sen Mitch McConnell, and the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan. The foreign secretary is said to be trying to gauge how much support there is in the Republican majority in Congress for a major reorientation of US foreign policy towards Moscow, and any erosion of Washington\u2019s commitment to Nato allies. A number of senior Senate Republicans, including Corker, have broken with Trump over his rejection of findings by the US intelligence community that Russia actively interfered with the election. Johnson is visiting Washington at a time when it is unclear what direction Trump\u2019s foreign policy will take. According to protocol, he is not permitted to have formal contacts with Tillerson until Senate confirmation hearings, due to start on Wednesday, have been completed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
