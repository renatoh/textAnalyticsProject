They called it Lost Vagueness \u2013 an ironic pastiche of a Las Vegas strip with casinos, theatrical bars, naked burlesque, even an \u201cunholy\u201d wedding chapel and a boxing ring. Now the festival-within-a-festival, which ended in 2007, is the subject of a documentary, released to coincide with Glastonbury\u2019s fallow year. The film, Lost in Vagueness, was shot over 12 years by director Sofia Olins, who describes it as a journey from \u201canti-society DIY debauchery\u201d to \u201cprescribed corporate anarchy\u201d \u2013 a shift she believes is indicative of Britain\u2019s modern festival culture. \u201cI\u2019d grown up in the rave scene when we all wore tracksuit bottoms and acted completely asexual,\u201d Olins says. \u201cSo when I jumped into Lost Vagueness it felt scary, dirty and weird. But aesthetically, it blew my mind.\u201d Lost Vagueness was born in the 90s out of Glastonbury\u2019s battle with new age travellers \u2013 a convoy of drifters who believed Michael Eavis\u2019s annual bash should remain true to its roots as a \u201cfree\u201d people\u2019s festival. \u201cThere was going to be a crunch time where all of us were either going to get beaten up by the police or thrown out. Something had to change,\u201d said Roy Gurvitz, who emerged as the travellers\u2019 unofficial leader. Gurvitz wanted to save the movement but knew it had to reinvent itself. After intense negotiations with Eavis, they carved out a piece of Worthy Farm, in the south-east corner, as the travellers\u2019 new base. What happened next, though, nobody could have predicted. In a moment of inspired irony, Gurvitz persuaded his entourage to ditch their army fatigues and start wearing tuxedos and ball gowns instead. \u201cWe put on a disguise, and lo and behold everybody looked at us very differently,\u201d he says. They set up a cafe, with a small casino and a tent for ballroom dancing. Almost overnight, Glastonbury\u2019s \u201ctravellers\u2019 problem\u201d, as Eavis had called it, disappeared and ticket sales began to pick up. \u201cIt changed the image of Glastonbury forever, it meant that you could come and do something else. It wasn\u2019t just a muddy field,\u201d says Olins. Lost Vagueness took off big time. The tents got bigger, the number of bars grew and the shows and performances took on a life of their own. In its heyday, in the mid-noughties, 50,000 revellers would head to the \u201cstrip\u201d for the late-night entertainment. But over the years, the sedate 1920s ballroom dancing gave way to hedonistic anything-goes parties. \u201cPeople had a certain expectation of a Lost Vagueness gig: they didn\u2019t want it to be sanitised, they wanted the whole thing to be completely debauched,\u201d says Leila Jones, who produced many of the acts. \u201cIt was an excessive period, and part of the package was that we had to be super-excessive. It wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d The turning point, she says, was when Lost Vagueness, the brand, started to be approached by corporate groups to run their parties. \u201cWhen people are coming to you with offers of proper money \u2013 how do you retain your integrity? They wanted us to be debauched idiots but then suddenly you\u2019re hosting a party for MTV. The two things weren\u2019t compatible.\u201d By 2007, its final year, the Lost Vagueness site had tripled in size. Issues of health and safety were becoming a headache, and Gurvitz was getting harder to negotiate with. \u201cIn those final years, Roy was so full of anger and jealousy, and he was behaving irrationally,\u201d says Jones. Gurvitz remains defiant. \u201cYou try organising 2,000 people who think they\u2019re anarchists,\u201d he says. The problem, as he sees it now, is that the monetisation of Lost Vagueness happened too fast. \u201cWe weren\u2019t accustomed to working like that, nobody was. What we were doing was at the cutting edge of performing arts. But dealing with tens of thousands of people was stressful.\u201d He insists, too, that the \u201cpowers-that-be\u201d at Glastonbury wanted him out. \u201cWhat we were doing had become too leftfield for them,\u201d he says. \u201cI started to feel like the enemy, like I was being demonised by people whose objective was to push me out and take over that area. They saw it had so much potential. They wanted me out so that they could tidy it up and use it themselves.\u201d In another twist, many of those who run the current version of Glastonbury\u2019s naughty corner \u2013 Shangri-La \u2013 are the same people who used to work for Gurvitz. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got their own production teams,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s slick, well organised and doesn\u2019t feel like everybody\u2019s about to get squashed.\u201d Gurvitz, who still lives \u201coff grid\u201d \u2013 currently in a solar powered vehicle on a disused airfield \u2013 has not been back to Glastonbury since he left, in a tank, a decade ago. \u201cI think the festival capitalised on the popularity of Lost Vagueness,\u201d he says. \u201cShangri-La had an easy ride. I mean, rather than having to invent themselves as an entity of the festival, they were handed it on a plate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
