Some MPs found Mr Brown's tone during Monday's Commons statement unsympathetic to the farmers' plight. Although many Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs were supportive, some Tories were angry at Mr Brown's apparent reluctance to embrace the Opposition's decision to stage a three-hour debate on the foot and mouth crisis today. Mr Brown told MPs that such a debate was a waste of ministerial and official resources at a critical time. He restated his position on his return from briefing EU colleagues in Brussels yesterday. \"It's not debates in parliament that control the disease, it's hard veterinary work on the ground. We should all be working together to exterminate the disease. I deplore people turning this into a party political issue,\" he said. Labour MPs admitted yesterday that Mr Brown had got this a bit wrong. \"He should have said 'I'll give the house regular statements instead',\" conceded one colleague. \"He sounded tetchy, but he must be tired and under pressure,\" said another. What most MPs seem to have forgotten is the history that lies behind the tiff. When the Phillips report on the great BSE disaster - home-grown, unlike the almost-certainly imported foot and mouth outbreak - was published last October, some Labour MPs were cross that the agriculture minister refrained from putting the party political boot in on culpable Tory ministers and their policies. That did not incline the Tory agriculture spokesman, Tim Yeo to soft pedal last week, though he pulled back in the Commons on Monday, adopting what Brown called \"a welcome change of tone\". It came too late to placate officials at the Ministry of Agriculture. \"Yeo was very critical of ministers, vetinerary staff and officials. It's a bit disheartening and Nick's fed up with it,\" explained one ally. Such is the ill-will that Mr Brown has not felt able to call in Mr Yeo, an amiable lightweight on the Tory left, to brief him. Mr Brown can point to support from fellow EU farm ministers, not always a charitable lot where Britain is concerned. Several have contrasted their own states' dithering over the slaughter of potentially-at-risk herds with Whitehall's steely determination to act fast and firmly. Asked if he had been criticised by any of them, Mr Brown yesterday told reporters: \"Absolutely not. All expressed their sympathy both in public and private. There is nothing but goodwill to Britain in our plight.\" Mr Brown, 50, a former advertising executive with Procter and Gamble in Newcastle, his adopted city, came to agriculture in 1998 after being moved sideways from chief whip. \"My local NFU like him because he's pragmatic and level-headed. He doesn't pretend to be an expert,\" a young Essex MP said yesterday. \"Welsh farmers like him because he talks straight, tells them what he knows and what he doesn't. There's no spin,\" said a Welsh veteran. What's going on?
