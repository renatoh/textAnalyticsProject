He must be working for England now, because they have a blockbusting story of their own. They completed an incredible comeback to win the CB Series 2-0, the first time that Australia have lost in the finals of their triangular tournament since 1992/93. For all their good form during the two wins in the last qualifying games, no one expected England to set about Australia in the manner they did in the finals. Even after they took a one match lead, it only prompted thoughts about the inevitable ferocity of Australia's response. And they were ferocious today, every bit as committed and aggressive as you'd expect the number one team in the world to be. But England rose to new heights, and outplayed and out-thought their hosts. To win the toss was a massive advantage at a Sydney ground notoriously difficult to chase totals on. Of course, Flintoff chose to bat. Ed Joyce and Mal Loye set about Australia's new ball attack. Loye played with an assurance, and power, that he has threatened to produce throughout the series. He was cut off by a poor run-call just after the game's second break for rain. When Strauss was caught behind, and Bell fell to another run out, England were 112 for four and struggling. Paul Collingwood, however, was reaching the end of one of the most phenomenal weeks enjoyed by any England cricketer in one-day cricket. He set about a steady repair job with Flintoff. The two batted calmly, and took England to 209. But their stand ended just before England had secured a convincing total. There was time enough for Australia to fight back, and England made just 37 for four off the last seven overs to finish with a total of 246 for eight. It was a competitive total, no better than that. Australia raced to 25 off the first three overs, as Saj Mahmood and Liam Plunkett continued their habit of making erratic starts. But then Collingwood produced another magic moment: a fine catch, stooping down by his ankles at short extra-cover, to remove Matthew Hayden. When Plunkett had Ponting caught in the slips with an outswinger, England could scent victory. They'd have to wait for it though, sitting through a series of rain delays and struggling with their Duckworth/Lewis calculations. It was England's response, and in particular Liam Plunkett's, to the longest of those breaks that really turned the match their way. In his first over back, Plunkett made Gilchrist play on, and had Clarke caught behind by Nixon. Australia were 40 for four. Flintoff removed Hussey, but the match was not yet won. Brad Hodge and Shane Watson set about a revival, and at one stage threatened to carry Australia all the way to victory. Ultimately it was Jamie Dalrymple who ended the match - producing a stunning diving catch at backward point to get Watson for 37, and then having Hodge caught by Ian Bell for 49. Some late and lusty blows by Brett Lee were never enough, and when the rain returned, it wasn't long before the match was abandoned and the result declared in England's favour by Duckworth/Lewis method. It was a remarkable game in so many ways, nerve racking, closely fought and packed with brilliant bits of cricket from both sides. After a short pause, England had a lap of honour in front of their long-suffering fans. Paul Collingwood was named man-of-the-finals for a week of cricket that brought him 294 runs at an average of 147, six wickets at 23 runs each, two run outs and two brilliant catches. England will be taking home some silverware after all, and suddenly the world cup looks an inviting prospect. Australia too will surely bounce back. They are still the world's best team, but they are an awful lot closer to the rest of the pack than they have been at any point in recent history. Today though, was all about the smiles on the England players' faces, and the sight of Freddy Flintoff holding that trophy aloft. This was surely one of the most remarkable returns to form in the history of English cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
