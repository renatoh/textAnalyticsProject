I checked again on the analysis of 1980s Britain in her book The Shock Doctrine, in which she concluded that \"the bottom line was that Chicago-style shock therapy just wasn't possible in a democracy like the UK\" (page 131). Unfortunately, it would now appear that, despite being a democracy, the UK is scheduled to experience its own version of shock therapy advocated by the coalition government as a desperate attempt to shore up the discredited neoliberal economic model. Tessa Harding Witchford, Cambridgehire \u2022\u2008Please, please, please make an effort to publish some pictures of Andy Murray with his mouth closed. You surpassed yourself yesterday (1 July), with the front pages of both the news and the sport sections adorned by images of his cavernous mouth. You could try printing some snaps of him hitting the ball. He seems to be quite good at that. Ian Aitken London \u2022\u2008Hadley Freeman's excellent defence of Harper Lee (G2, 29 June) reminded me of a more contentious verse on the subject that an English graduate friend taught me: \"The reclusive Harper Lee, / As any fool can see, / Did not write 'a Mockingbird', / 'Twas that other old shocking bird, / Her good friend, Truman Capote!\" Tim Matthews Luton, Bedfordshire \u2022\u2008So let's get this right \u2013 the new efficiency and reform group charged with injecting some business ethos into the civil service is to be headed by the former bosses of BP and the Football Association (Report, 1 July). What's that phrase \u2026 \"beyond satire\"? RE Cooper Sudbourne, Suffolk \u2022\u2008Andrew Lansley does himself no favours criticising Jamie Oliver (Report, 1 July). I think Ken Clarke should put him charge of youth offending. The empathy and commonsense he shows is so refreshing, unlike the old Tory mantra.
