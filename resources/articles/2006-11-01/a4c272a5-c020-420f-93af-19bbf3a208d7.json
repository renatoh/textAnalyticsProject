Ignore your colleagues' guffaws: if you've been following personal trainer Angie Dowds' tailor-made moves to date, you'll already be seeing the difference. If not, start with this: a squat with a difference (just make sure you swap your shoes for trainers first). \"A brilliant version of the squat, this exercise will do everything the squat does and more - opening up the hips, energising you and getting the heart rate up,\" says Angie. \"Because we've introduced the jump, you're asking the muscles to move in a different way; asking a little bit more.\" 1 Start upright, arms out in front of your chest, close together, and feet shoulder width apart. Focus your eyes on the horizon throughout. 2 You have to keep a really good posture and a braced core for this exercise because you're dropping down. 3 Keeping your arms together, perform a small lunge, taking the feet out to a wide stance. 4 Now jump into a drop squat - lower than 90 degrees if you want, but make sure it's a smooth movement with no impact. No galumphing; jump as lightly as possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
