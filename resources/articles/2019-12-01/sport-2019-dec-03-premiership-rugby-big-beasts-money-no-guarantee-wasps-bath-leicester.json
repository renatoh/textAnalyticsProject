Look no further than the current Premiership table. Stuck in the bottom four along with Saracens, still deep in the minus numbers following their salary cap defrocking, are Leicester, Wasps and Bath. It is a bit like discovering Lord Grantham preparing his own breakfast in the pantry. All three of the aforementioned clubs are traditionally more accustomed to the high life, albeit in contrasting settings. Leicester have the highest average attendance in the league, Wasps\u2019s move to Coventry was only meant to bring milk and honey and this coming April will mark the 10th anniversary of the purchase of Bath by their multimillionaire owner, Bruce Craig. The solitary trophy during his tenure to date is the reserve A league title in 2014-15. Saracens have been rather more successful but Nigel Wray\u2019s estimated \u00a350m investment in his local club is presently yielding only trouble and strife. Over in France, meanwhile, Mourad Boudjellal has sold his controlling share in Toulon, with the club looking to replace their galactico policy with a more homegrown squad. Admittedly the World Cup winner Eben Etzebeth has just arrived in the south of France but the winds of change are whipping in off the Mediterranean. In many ways it is welcome news. How dull would it be if there were no salary cap and the richest side romped away with the trophies year after year? Leaving aside the Saracens saga, the most significant English club rugby story of the last decade has been the ascent of Exeter Chiefs from a Championship side to English champions and beyond. Imagine how one-sided the title race would have been in recent seasons had there been no promotion to the Premiership and they had been required to stay where they were? True, Bristol Bears\u2019 stirring ascent owes much to Steve Lansdown\u2019s huge personal investment while the Top 14 leaders Lyon have also spent big. The World Cup has also skewed early-season results but, even so, the moral of the story remains clear enough. There is significantly more to being a consistently successful rugby team than mere wealth alone. To be at Bath last Friday night was to be confronted with a good example. They may have the most incredible training ground in rugby at Farleigh House, where Lord Grantham would feel instantly at home, but the pitch at the Rec is the worst in the league. Walking across the dead-ball area behind the posts brought to mind Grimpen Mire, the fictional bog which featured heavily in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s The Hound of the Baskervilles. One false step and it felt you might be sucked into its mysterious depths for ever. Of course it has been wet and the neighbouring river Avon is just a stone\u2019s throw away but let\u2019s just say it was not a total surprise to watch Bath\u2019s backs apparently running through treacle. Maybe that is how certain players prefer it: Clermont will certainly be slowed down when they visit this Friday. Attempting to weave pretty patterns on it between November and February, however, would be tricky even if your backline contained Christian Cullen, Cheslin Kolbe and Danny Cipriani combined. Which brings us back to Craig. I well remember him showing me around Farleigh House in 2010 and gesturing towards an antique table on the first floor. \u201cThe next time you come and interview me hopefully we\u2019ll have the European Cup and the Premiership trophy on there,\u201d he murmured. In fairness, he also made the point shortly afterwards that it was not absolutely guaranteed to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a fallacy that if you throw a lot of money at it, you\u2019re going to get a winning team. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d How prophetic those words have proved. There is, to be clear, absolutely nothing wrong with ambition. Club rugby has also been fortunate to attract the number of investors it has but, ultimately, it is judgment, enlightened coaching, shrewd recruitment and intangibles like team spirit and togetherness that separate the sheep from the goats. Look at the transformation in Northampton\u2019s fortunes under Chris Boyd and his assistant coaches this season, achieved with many of the same players he inherited. Look at how far Pat Lam\u2019s Bristol, even with a couple of marquee signings, have come in the past 12 months? As John Paul Getty once said: \u201cMy formula for success is to rise early, work late and strike oil.\u201d Money can definitely help \u2013 of course it can \u2013 but in rugby it is only part of the solution. Best of British Talk to the people who run the Premiership and they breezily dismiss the idea of a British and Irish League, formed by the amalgamation of 14 English clubs with the 10 leading sides from Ireland, Scotland and Wales, from 2022 onwards. With the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners having now invested in both the Premiership and the Pro14 there is theoretically more of a business case for a two-tier competition, but only if it offers more attractive entertainment than currently exists. Cross-border games are more popular in Wales, and the leading Irish provinces would be more than competitive but, with a vibrant domestic league and a European competition already available, it looks destined to be a much harder sell in England. One to watch This is the 25th anniversary season of the first European Cup and there will be a presentation to Munster, as one of the original competing sides, before their home game against Saracens this weekend. Once the whistle goes the visitors will also be swiftly reminded that in Munster they relish a big European game more than almost anywhere else on the continent. Sarries had it tough against Racing 92 in Paris last month but, if the home side get ahead early, that may have been a walk in the parc compared with Limerick on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
