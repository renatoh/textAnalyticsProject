Lauren Patterson, 24, went missing in the early hours of Saturday 12 October and posts by her boyfriend James Grima on social media suggested she was later found dead. Her death has not been confirmed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but, on Wednesday, the Qatari Ministry of Interior wrote on its website: \"The police has arrested the suspects of an European woman's murder. The case has been referred to Public Prosecution to complete further judicial procedures applicable in this regard.\" After his initial Facebook posts reporting his girlfriend was missing, Mr Grima - who is from Malta - wrote on the site on Sunday: \"I can't believe that it had to end this way Lauren, I really don't. I was so happy that I had finally found someone that could change my life so much, and in such a positive way too \u2026 Rest In Peace, babe \u2026 I will always look up at the sky cause you always were the brightest star and always will be.\" And he added: \"I love you so much babe, I really do and I can't get over the fact that you were taken away so cruelly, it really breaks my heart to think about it.\" Lauren Patterson's mother Alison, who was reported to be on her way to Doha to identify the body formally, wrote on Facebook on Monday: \"She was truly a remarkable girl, my rock, always there for everyone. I know she's in heaven now in her Daddy's arms.\" Reports have suggested that Ms Patterson's body was found in a bin outside the Cigale hotel in central Doha but local newspaper the Doha News reported that no police cordon had been put in place and said employees denied a body was found nearby. The Foreign Office said it was providing Lauren Patterson's family, from Chiselhurst in south east London, with consular assistance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
