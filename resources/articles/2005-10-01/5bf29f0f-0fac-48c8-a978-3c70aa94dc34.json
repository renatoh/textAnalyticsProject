Lothar Bisky, the head of the Left party, suffered a humiliating rebuff on Monday when MPs meeting for the first time since last month's general election refused to back him for a key parliamentary post. MPs from both Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats joined forces to block Bisky's appointment as the new vice-chairman of parliament - shooting down his candidacy in three separate votes. The move follows claims that Bisky, 64, worked as an informal collaborator for East Germany's secret police, the Stasi. According to yesterday's Berliner Zeitung, Bisky's name crops up twice in the \"Rosenholz\" files rescued from the Stasi archives by a CIA agent after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Bisky denies the claims. He admitted writing reports on his West German trips but says he has no idea what happened to them. Last month Marianne Birthler, the head of the Stasi archive, said several MPs in the Left party had collaborated with the Stasi. Yesterday Left party officials accused Germany's mainstream parties of a conspiracy, and said the claims against Bisky were fabricated. \"We are not going to allow others to dictate who our candidate should be,\" said Hendrik Thalheim, the party's press spokesman. The row illustrates the raw divisions between East and West German MPs and the hostility towards the new Left party from Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats. The Left party was founded over the summer after the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to East Germany's communist party, joined forces with disaffected West German SPD activists led by the SPD's former chairman Oskar Lafontaine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
