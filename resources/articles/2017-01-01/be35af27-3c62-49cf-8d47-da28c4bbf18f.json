Alan Doyle, who runs Keep Kempton Green, has spent more than three years fighting Jockey Club proposals to build on land next to the famous track and claims credit for turning around the local council\u2019s attitude to the plans. Doyle recalled: \u201cPeople said years ago: \u2018You lot are mad, why are you wasting your time? This is going to happen inevitably.\u2019 And we turned it round; the council, having been against us, is with us. The Jockey Club, who thought they would be finished by now, haven\u2019t started.\u201d But Doyle was as stunned as most of the racing community this week when it emerged that the club\u2019s plans now extend beyond the parklands alongside the Sunbury track and involve the entire site, with the result that the course could be closed in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shock,\u201d Doyle continued, mulling the news over coffee in Sunbury\u2019s Magpie pub. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think they\u2019d go so far as threatening to bulldoze the place. It\u2019s profitable.\u201d A Jockey Club spokesman confirmed that Kempton makes an annual profit, though the extent of it would be difficult to extricate from the accounts of a group that includes 13 other tracks. Doyle argues that the local infrastructure cannot cope with significant additional housing and points to news reports from 2014 suggesting that Sunbury health centre is under as much pressure as any in Britain, with patients sometimes queuing before dawn for an appointment. He says the local roads do not cope well with existing traffic and fears for the consequences of another 3,000 cars being added. Asked to assess his chance of preventing the proposed development, Doyle said: \u201cI think we\u2019re getting closer and closer to 50-50. When we started, years ago, I reckoned we had a 20% chance. It\u2019s amazing how the facts can change if you put up a fight, absolutely amazing. If you make your local officials\u2019 lives not nice, they change their minds. And it\u2019s amazing how things that are \u2018inevitable\u2019 aren\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone. This is happening on sites all around the south-east and I\u2019m sure there are places in a worse plight, with more claim to be green belt than Kempton Park. We\u2019re not alone but obviously for us it\u2019s important. It\u2019s green belt and if Kempton goes, we have no chance of protecting any other piece of land in this borough. It\u2019s a flagship.\u201d Doyle, who discovered the initial plans for Kempton years ago while chair of a local residents\u2019 association, stresses he is not simply anti-development and tells of how his group cooperated with one local builder who reduced the scale of his plans. \u201cWho knows? We may lose. But you have to put up a fight. You can\u2019t just let it happen.\u201d The Jockey Club says it is faced with a once-in-30-years opportunity to develop Kempton and raise a huge sum for investment elsewhere in its racecourse holdings. The rare opening is presented by Spelthorne borough council\u2019s recent call for sites for new housing, coupled with the simultaneous review of the local green-belt boundaries. The club says it will not proceed with its plans unless it is assured of raising \u00a3100m, to be spent on other jumps tracks as well as on a new all-weather circuit at Newmarket. The council\u2019s leader, Ian Harvey, has reiterated his opposition to any proposed housing at Kempton. Quoted in local media after Tuesday\u2019s news, Harvey said: \u201cI have consistently made clear my strong opposition to development of this site and my determination to protect the green belt in Spelthorne. Nothing has changed. The council\u2019s finances are very robust and any suggestion that it needs money from new development is completely groundless.\u201d Behind the bar at the Magpie, Toni Doncaster expressed shock at Kempton\u2019s possible closure. \u201cI think it\u2019s just insane because it\u2019s such a massive part of the community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that Sunbury\u2019s so known for. The racedays are such a big thing and I remember going to Kempton market on Thursdays with my mum. It\u2019s a massive part of all our lives.\u201d Saturday\u2019s jump-racing fixture here may be an occasion for regular spectators to voice their displeasure but Wednesday night\u2019s all-weather fixture was as sparsely attended as most such racedays. One professional gambler, known only by the name Tracksuit Dave, expressed a measure of regret. \u201cThis is my bread and butter and a lot of other people\u2019s as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely track. It\u2019s a travesty to me.\u201d Nor was he impressed by the plans for a new track at Newmarket. \u201cThe only people who are gonna go are the stable lads and they\u2019ll get in for nothing. You\u2019re talking about history \u2013 look at these two statues, Desert Orchid and Kauto Star. This is gutting for everybody, not just the punter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
