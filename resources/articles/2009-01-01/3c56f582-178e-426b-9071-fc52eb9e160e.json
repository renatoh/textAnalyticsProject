A tall and attractive animal, Calgary Bay beat two decent horses in Kicks For Free and Tartak when winning the Dipper Novice Chase in grand style here yesterday, although he made one desperate mistake at the top of the hill, nearly ridding himself of Tony McCoy. Afterwards Knight could have been talking about Best Mate in the way that she said: \"We loved him from the first time we saw him, loose schooling in Ireland as a three-year-old.\" But the old Knight nerves, or Hen's hesitancy, kicked in when she contemplated the big prizes Calgary Bay must surely tilt for later in his career and she was sitting on the Festival fence regarding plans for the horse. Sounding a little like Goldilocks in the three bears' cottage, she explained that the Arkle is too short and the RSA Chase too far, for the time being, while her horse would have too much weight in handicaps and is too short on experience for the Ryanair. In her defence, it must be said that Calgary Bay did run poorly in a hurdle race at last year's Festival. Perhaps the Grade One at Aintree's Grand National meeting will be just right for Knight's ideals. Eventually, Calgary Bay will go into real stayers' territory. In his family is the Scottish National winner Grey Abbey, but even McCoy is not sure that, at six, he is ready for three miles. The jockey expressed, in slightly different terms, all the caveats against coming back here in March and then added a further warning of his own: \"I think he may have a tendency to be better left-handed.\" That may be a barrier to Knight's preference for the novice chase at Sandown formerly known as the Scilly Isles, a race won by Best Mate in his novice season. For all her reticence, Knight is clearly excited. \"That mistake was good for him,\" she said. \"It will have taught him a lesson. He has finished second a lot of times but has been finding one horse too fast over distances too short.\" The softly, softly approach has never been the game with Lough Derg, who battled on under Tom Scudamore to gain his fourth course win in the Steel Plate And Sections Hurdle after Franchoek under McCoy looked sure to win at the last, but faded to be third. Lough Derg is one of those who could line up against Big Buck's in the World Hurdle in March. Paul Nicholls' idea to switch Big Buck's to hurdles for the first time in this country bore fruit immediately, with Ruby Walsh partnering him to win the Unicoin Homes Handicap Hurdle from Don't Push It. Nicholls reckoned there was no point in continuing with the French-bred over fences when \"he would have to run in races he cannot win\". Those races would include the Gold Cup, for which Nicholls holds a couple of aces in Denman and Kauto Star. Now Big Buck's will go for the Cleeve Hurdle here at the end of the month, and then the World Hurdle. Rambling Minster's win in the Annual Pony Club Raceday Handicap Chase was a first for the trainer and jockey team of Keith and James Reveley. \"It has never been a lucky place for us,\" said Keith. \"My mother, Mary, did not have many winners when she came south, although Cab On Target did win the Spa Hurdle here.\" The 23,000 crowd \u2014 not including a large number of children, admitted free \u2014 enjoyed a fine day's racing thanks to the work of the clerk of the course, Simon Claisse, and his staff, who laid down frost covers to beat the weather over Christmas. Claisse was caught out by a cold snap two years ago when forced to abandon a Saturday card one hour after saying racing was 75% likely to go ahead. This time, he must take a deal of credit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
