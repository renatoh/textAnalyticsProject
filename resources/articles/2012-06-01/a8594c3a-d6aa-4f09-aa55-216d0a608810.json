All week the Corporation was dangerously bullish. \"From here on, every England game will be live on the BBC,\" presenter Gary Lineker trumpeted at least twice during the Portugal-Czech Republic game, without the slightest suggestion that might turn out to be fewer than three games. And commentator Jonathan Pearce chimed in: \"All the England games from now on are live at the BBC. There's a growing belief that the English boys can do it, and why not?\" Those of you preserving these columns in the official Screen Break 2012 souvenir binder will know from previous writings that I am as stupidly optimistic as the next man \u2013 provided the next man is someone who actually put money on England to win Euro 2012 \u2013 but I am not sure it was entirely wise of our national broadcaster to join in. The BBC was still giving it the full gun before kick-off, with a stirring poem, highlights of all England's quarter-final tournament successes \u2013 the two in colour, at least \u2013 and a rapper called Lethal Bizzle, or Mr Bizzle as he's known down the building society, performing a number called Three Little Words, the words being Come On England. Lineker and his team were on location for the first time, and clearly meant business. Also, in this very special year, the Corporation's own Princess of Hearts had a pre-match audience with the Nation's Favourite. Gabby Logan met Ashley Cole, not so much for an interview as hagiography. \"Ashley, you'll go down as one of the greats,\" was her opening salvo, \"Do you feel appreciated?\" \"Wow, that's a tough one you've lobbed at me there, Gabby,\" our hero somehow failed to counter. And Gabby persisted: \"Is there a misconception about you in the wider footballing family?\" Cole's capacity for never knowingly being skinned on the outside, however, illustrated in the montage that followed, was impressive, and was cited by pundits Hansen, Shearer and Dixon as just one of the reasons England were destined to win. Penalties weren't mentioned. Ashley's unfortunate miss may now delay his knighthood. I don't know whether anyone at the BBC is familiar with the concept of hubris, but the heavily rotated trailer featuring the England lads' greatest moments to a soundtrack of Santana's Everything Is Coming Our Way, seemed to be saying to any football gods taking an interest, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough. Great choice of music, mind you. It frustrates me when they use a tune by one of these modern pop acts \u2013 by which I mean anything post-Alvin Stardust \u2013 and then fail to tell you what it is. The Corporation could take a leaf from Sky's Soccer Saturday, who name artists and titles on all their backing music, enabling me to be down with the kids for at least five minutes, until I forget the details, and also where I put my keys, and what I went into the kitchen for. The double meaning of the Santana song, of course, is that everything is going the way of the BBC. The BBC, we were constantly reminded, now owned the ass off the England team \u2013 as Mr Bizzle would no doubt put it \u2013 the sub-text being that we could all settle down, as the nation traditionally has at times of national celebration/lamentation, in the comfortably capacious arms of Auntie. I am not sure everyone would have found that as reassuring as it might once have been. If my mail is anything to go by, ITV narrowly shaded the group stage. The BBC's Lineker, painful puns aside \u2013 \"It's Spain, the result was Navas [the scorer] in doubt\" plumbing new depths \u2013 has been a steady pair of hands compared with the labouring Adrian Chiles, with whom it is difficult to feel at ease, but ITV are generally felt to have won the punditry battle. The be-stubbled king of mean, Roy Keane, was the only pundit brave enough to predict an Italy win, and Jamie Carragher and Roberto Mart\u00ednez were a pair of welcome fresh voices on the experts' sofa, even though Chiles must have made his joke about Wigan's passing game to Mart\u00ednez at least four times. In the commentary box, the BBC's main man Guy Mowbray does the job efficiently enough, and has the added benefit of keeping Jonathan Pearce away from the microphone. \"Hunger will lead a fox out of the forest,\" he said of Ronaldo. \"But will he have the desire to take the tournament by the scruff of the neck? A strutting peacock or a striding colossus?\" There really is no need to write all this stuff down. Have a swim in the hotel pool. Enjoy yourself. It may now turn out to be the strutting peacock's tournament, and that is another plus for ITV. Not only did they have the best tune, Peter and the Wolf, but their sequence starts with a puppet of the Portugal star. It's the BBC for the semi finals, but some of us will choose Prokofiev over Lethal Bizzle for the final next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
