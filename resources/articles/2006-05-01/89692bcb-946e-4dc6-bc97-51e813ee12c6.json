Why on earth should he feel suspicious about a commercial company? They are there to make money. To do so they try to associate themselves with our interests, values and passions. Surely only the naive would be upset to find that somewhere else, the appeal is slightly different from here? We cannot afford to get emotional about ad creative. I come from the more down-to-earth world of direct and database marketing, where a good commercial offer and appropriate, relevant targeting are the starting point. Appealing creative comes second to strong content. As the media world fragments, and broadcast media reach increasingly niche audiences, advertising and all forms of marketing will have to adopt more, not less, local colour. Martyn Viquerat Director, CDMS, Whiston, Merseyside Double prejudice Halle Berry rightly accuses Chris Moyles of racism (Quote of the week, May 22 ). Mori polling published by Stonewall in 2003 demonstrated that individuals prejudiced against gay people are twice as likely as the general population to be prejudiced against an ethnic group too. Moyles has had licence from the BBC to belittle gay people for so long that it is hardly surprising this further underlying unpleasantness has now emerged. Ben SummerskillChief executive, Stonewall Moore's the pity I was prepared to be generous to Jane Moore and not let the newspaper she works for colour my opinion of her, but she still managed to blow it in the first paragraph (Interview, May 22). What sort of money do you need to be on, for \u00a3125 a day to cease to be a significant amount for a single day's work? Am I the first person to point out that while it might have been \"a lot of money back then\", for most of us on local papers it is still a bloody significant amount of money today? My current wage in my full-time job comes nowhere near equalling this paltry sum. Paul Catlow, Stockport \u00b7 It's a pity that an educated woman like Jane Moore has to resort to calling Charlotte Church's friend \"fat\". Her justification, that if we all think something then it's OK to say it, is pathetic and infantile. \"And just because you think it and I say it doesn't mean that our view is any different.\" It makes a hell of a lot of difference to the victim of such bile. Anthony Andrews, Portchester, Hants Curse those celebrities Exactly who is this \"we\" that Cristina Odone is talking about when she makes the claim that we've \"all got stars in our eyes?\" (On the press, May 22). It might well surprise Cristina to learn this but, actually, we don't. No, Cristina, some of us still want newspapers to fulfil their primary obligation to educate us and make us aware of the world we live in. I don't care which celebrity kisses which celebrity. I do care, however, about the future of a society which sees voters increasingly disenchanted with politics because, as a teacher in a sixth-form college, how can I get youngsters to take an interest in political matters when even the broadsheets are celebrity-obsessed?
