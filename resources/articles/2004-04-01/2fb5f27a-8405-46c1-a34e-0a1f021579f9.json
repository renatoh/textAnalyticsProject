Chelsea's head coach metaphorically tied red and white ribbons on to the Premiership trophy. 'After their Liverpool match, I say well done. They are the champions because they are full of quality and showed fantastic character,' Ranieri said. His own team were far too bushed to muster enough character of their own. The contrast between the electricity of Tuesday night in Europe and the ennui of bread and butter at the Bridge was remarkable. Middlesbrough were missing key players at front and back and, having won the Carling Cup this season, had little motivation. After all, they do not need to qualify for Europe twice. All the same, Chelsea struggled to raise a gallop. In the circumstances, few diehard Blues will have too many complaints. Surely they would have swapped the most miserable of results here for their Champions League nirvana, considering the Premiership was a long shot, regardless of yesterday's outcome. It is a longer shot now and Ranieri is looking at rivals over his shoulder rather than those ahead. Manchester United, he said, are 'a big shark'. This match was notable only for Joe Cole's first 90 minutes in a Chelsea shirt (uneventful), Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n's reappearance, as a substitute, after a five-month spell injured (slightly more encouraging) and Claude Makelele being taken to hospital with a knee injury (Ranieri was worried). The big screen reminded fans that they could watch the highlights from midnight on the club's TV station. Not a bad option for insomniacs. Wayne Bridge, the match-winner in the most important triumph of the Roman Abramovich era thus far, was rewarded for his remarkable effort with a rest, but perhaps on this occasion Ranieri was guilty of too little tinkering. Only Marcel Desailly and Celestine Babayaro played no part against Arsenal. 'I cannot kill my players,' Ranieri said of his decision to omit Damien Duff, Mario Melchiot and Scott Parker. Middlesbrough defended in numbers - with the ever reliable Colin Cooper and Ugo Ehiogu excelling - and frustrated the home team to speculative shots from distance. After 20 minutes of nothing much, a lone voice from Teesside piped up: 'Howay, Boro. Come on, you know they're shite!' Tongue in cheek it may have been, but with Chelsea so soporific, the invitation was there for their opponents to use far more time and space than they might have expected from a trip to a team chasing their first title for half a century. Gaizka Mendieta played shrewdly on the right flank and went close with a free-kick, Juninho pulled a few strings, butMiddlesbrough lacked finesse in the box. John Terry was Chelsea's most pumped-up performer and, having made a vital interception to deny Szilard Nemeth, he thumped in a header the other end that required Mark Schwarzer to tip away at full stretch. More typical of Chelsea's slumber was the sight of Frank Lampard miscueing with a selection of half-chances he might normally have buried, while Ver\u00f3n enlivened proceedings with a couple of whipped free-kicks. If the Abramovich era is to begin with silverware, it looks like Monte Carlo or bust.
