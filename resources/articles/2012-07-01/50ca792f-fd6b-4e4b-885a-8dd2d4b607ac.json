But there are many online publishers in the UK who are also hoping that millions will be downloading our content as well. The BBC's head of Olympics coverage, Roger Mosey, has called London 2012 \"the first digital Olympics\", a point reinforced by the central place given to the inventor of the internet, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, at Friday's opening ceremony. And for those running websites at the BBC and for large UK newspapers, the Games represents a golden opportunity to showcase their skills and increase traffic and revenue. The BBC is streaming 24 Olympic channels online in addition to its conventional broadcast coverage. But broadcasting rights issues mean this video footage will be available only to UK audiences. In addition, only IOC-accredited commercial websites such as the main newspapers will be allowed to show any filmed footage \u2013 and these will be two-minute packages handed out by the BBC every 24 hours. Some rivals feel daunted by the scale of the BBC's operation, which has been in the planning for more than two years and is run by its heavily-staffed Future, Media and Technology division. The BBC's \"proposition\" is to make sure that every single moment of the Olympics can be viewed in any way possible \u2013 from the tired office manager sneaking a peek on his work computer, to the iPad user watching a re-run of a day's events in bed. Phil Fearnley, general manager of BBC news and knowledge, says he is expecting some Olympic events to have double the online traffic of the existing record for a single BBC event, the England v Slovenia football game which was streamed online during the recent European Championship. \"Of course we don't know what the events will be, but our job is to make sure people do not miss a moment wherever they are,\" he says, declining to give precise figures. A fierce battle for online clicks is also being fought between commercial publishers such as the Telegraph and the Guardian, all of whom are reporting signs of an uplift in online traffic even before Friday's opening ceremony. The Guardian has unveiled a number of \"visualisations\", such as its page noting whether a record has been broken , and is playing to its traditional strength in data provision to engage in conversations with readers. So far it has collated all the names of the 11,000-plus competing athletes, allowing its readers to investigate areas such as the gender balance of national competitors, or to note for example that China has the highest proportion of badminton players. \"People want raw data \u2013 they know and trust it,\" says Simon Rogers, editor of the Guardian's data store. The Telegraph \u2013 which has only one third of its online viewing inside Britain \u2014 tends to package its data into neat and quirky stories and on Friday also launched its events tracker, a front page device allowing easy navigation. \"The Olympics will be huge,\" says the Telegraph's digital editor Edward Roussel. \"The rest of the world will be looking at not just how we host the Games but how we cover it too, and we hope to reset the benchmark. Now we have mobile and tablet, the challenge and the opportunity is there.\" Offering a vast amount of information without overwhelming readers is the key, he says. \"Of course we cannot be a broadcaster, but nothing can beat the web for journalism or data provision,\" adds the Telegraph's head of sport Ben Clissitt, who has spent much of the past year planning Olympic coverage. But the likely impact of the Olympics still remains an unknown. \"The internet has reinvented itself in the past four years,\" said a senior media commentator. \"What was the Mail Online four years ago? Nothing so big. It's uncharted territory. \"It is the pre-planned story of the year for everybody. Everybody is stuffing their sites with new interactives and so on, but will people be able to get a lot of traction when official broadcasters BBC and NBC have so much coverage in their home territories?\" Milo Yiannopoulos, editor of the tech website The Kernel, says: \"It's going to be massively frustrating for foreign visitors to have to rely on live blogs and Twitter if rights issues prevent broadcast to other countries. This is one event you really need to watch.\" Like any other major news event, he says, increased traffic is one thing, but monetising online content is harder. \"Whatever happens, I still think website owners looking to make money out of the Olympics are on a hiding to nothing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
