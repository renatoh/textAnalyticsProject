The Hamptons is his new normal, after he ditched Manhattan in March. Not that he is keeping track of time. \u201cThe month of May soon turned into August, which then turned into November,\u201d Condo says to the Guardian from his studio later that day. \u201c2020 is just the framing of the time lapse.\u201d It\u2019s all a blur, much like his messy paintings, which are now on view at Hauser &amp; Wirth in New York City. Internal Riot, opening this week, features 18 paintings and drawings, ranging from nightmarish splashes of insanity, to portraits of Virginia Woolf, Bugs Bunny and the rapper Travis Scott. There are also a series of chaotic landscapes, depicting the artist\u2019s own inner storm, which easily mirrors our own anxious moment. The show digs into self-isolation, madness and the divided disarray that America is today. \u201cThe \u2018divisive inequality of America\u2019 is how I would describe it,\u201d Condo corrects me. \u201cIt was always there, but now change can\u2019t just be an idea or a slogan \u2013 it has to get real and fulfill the ideals it supposedly stands for.\u201d It ties into his trademark abstracted portraits, calling to mind Pablo Picasso\u2019s cubism, but updated with an expressionistic, pop art flair, painted with a bold Disneyland palette, where outer conflict meets inner struggle. Condo calls this style of painting \u201cartificial realism\u201d or \u201cpsychological cubism\u201d. He describes it as tracing the thoughts of each character, capturing their overlaying, fluctuating moods with a paintbrush. \u201cPeople are torn apart in and of themselves, barely human at times,\u201d said Condo. \u201cYou can see a person trying to break free from a structure and become whole again.\u201d The new works in this show \u2013 all made in 2020 \u2013 range from Father and Daughter with Face Mask, two freaked-out figures all masked up, Hysteria, a figure screaming in the dark, and There\u2019s No Business Like No Business, which depicts a sad, solitary figure in distress (it calls to mind all the small business owners in New York who have closed up shop). And his own mirror? What does Condo see when he looks in the mirror today? Just look at his latest painting entitled Internal Riot. On a crimson red background, it looks as though a man is yelling at himself. What does the creator see when he looks at it? \u201cA combination of images scrambled up from newscasts and footage of the riots that took place across America,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the desire to relentlessly pursue the perpetrators who inhabit the periphery of the mind and root them out.\u201d The artist came into the spotlight after befriending Jean-Michel Basquiat in the 1980s, which led to him working at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory in New York. He then fled to Paris, where he lived and painted for years, and outraged the UK with his ghastly portrait of the Queen as a scabby-looking monster in 2006. He then returned to New York, where he painted Allen Ginsberg\u2019s final portrait in the hospital before he died. Up until March, Condo was living on the Upper East Side. He\u2019s well versed in the rap world. Condo painted the album cover for Kanye West\u2019s 2010 album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and shortly after, painted a Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag for Kim Kardashian West (West has shown his face at Condo\u2019s studio and museum openings). Even Jay-Z name-dropped Condo\u2019s name in a rap song (\u201cCondos in my condo I want a row of\u201d), from his 2013 album Magna Carta Holy Grail. But for now, Condo is alone, revelling in solitude. Be it good or bad, it reminds him of his childhood, growing up in a small New England town. \u201cI would spend hours in my room alone painting, not even knowing there was such a thing as what we call \u2018the art world\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it feels a bit like that, where I am totally out of touch with everything for purposes of safety and health. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do but create art.\u201d Condo\u2019s latest work can be seen as a continuation of his online exhibition from April called Drawings for Distanced Figures, which featured ink, pencil and crayon figures capturing the paranoia, fear and panic brought on by the onslaught of 2020. \u201cIt is an eerily existential feeling knowing that you are somehow existing in the absence of a familiar world,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is very isolating at times, and my moods change with the weather.\u201d While each character represents a different mental state or mood, they also act as visions of what it\u2019s like to be living in this very moment. \u201cFractured portraits tell us about the multiple emotions we are experiencing, all at the same time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey mirror the normal person in today\u2019s world. I suppose this is the new normal.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine one of New York\u2019s most iconic artists gone without any plans to return. \u201cI had a feeling the country was not prepared to handle it, and it wouldn\u2019t be healthy to stay there,\u201d said Condo. \u201cKnowing that once I left, I would be stuck, I felt I was doing the right thing, regardless of how isolating it might become.\u201d After eight months away, he finally returned to New York City, \u201cto look around\u201d, he says, then left again. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the same any more to be dependent on anything, other than oneself.\u201d Condo reached a breaking point at the end of May (around the time George Floyd was killed). He painted a piece entitled The End of May 2020, depicting a portrait of a figure immersed in trouble and darkness. \u201cIt was a cracked head with a splat of gold thrown in its face,\u201d as Condo describes it. \u201cIt certainly did express my own crazed mental state, at that point.\u201d The three things that have kept him grounded in quarantine are this: staying away from the news, making art and keeping loved ones close. \u201cI\u2019ve had frequent visits by my partner Leila Josefowicz, with whom I started a film project about art and music,\u201d said Condo. \u201cIt was nice to have just one visitor every week or two for a couple days. \u201cIn between, I just drive around listening to Jimi Hendrix full blast in my car,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the Hamptons, the trees, the ocean and the fish store help, too.\u201d In terms of where his compass points him next, it all comes down to politics. \u201cThe migratory sense, in my mind, has to do with the fight-or-flight instinct,\u201d says Condo. \u201cAnd I honestly believe many people in this country feel that if Trump wins again, they want to leave and move somewhere else.\u201d Condo has an understandably bleak view of what\u2019s been happening of late. \u201cI think that perception and comprehensible information based in truthful reality is what has been burned to the ground,\u201d he says. \u201cAnswers are lit on fire like burning leaves in the wind. Nobody really has any facts.\u201d Despite the current dystopian storm, Condo is looking forward to 2021 with a slice of hope, though. \u201cI think the outcome of the election will have a huge impact on the basic state of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope to continue making art in a healthier environment, and most of all, that my kids can take what they\u2019ve learned from these horrible times of suffering and move forward in a more optimistic and healthy world.\u201d Internal Riot is on show at Hauser &amp; Wirth in New York City until 23 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
