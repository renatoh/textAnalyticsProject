Where, he wondered, were the present-day equivalents of those early primers from the 1960s that delivered vital nuggets of biographical information (\"Pete Quaife is the only Kink who enjoys horse-riding\") and valuable insights into the music industry (\"the hit-parade isn't always dominated by the most worthy discs of the day\")? Robinson should be directed to the CD booklet of Brighton quartet British Sea Power's third album, which resurrects the lost art with aplomb. It features an essay ostensibly detailing the album's various recording sessions that keeps digressing into ever-more opaque areas: wrestling, the careers of Hedy Lamarr and excitable TV naturalist Johnny Kingdom, and the existence of a Chatham pound shop called, unbelievably, the Disco Drug Store. It variously quotes Brazilian soccer coach Dunga, Joan Collins and boozy 90s rock conceptualists Earl Brutus and ends with the sage advice that \"all the nice girls love a pasty\". It seems unlikely that you'll find anything similar in the packaging of, say, the new album by the Kooks. The sleevenotes to Do You Like Rock Music? are more interesting to read than most bands' albums are to listen to. Yet, you suspect, they're precisely the kind of thing that polarises opinion about British Sea Power. There's a disheartening sense that the general public might agree with Nick Hornby, whose book 31 Songs sneeringly held up British Sea Power and their weird ideas - the songs about ornithology, the military garb, the stages covered in foliage and stuffed animals - as an example of how artists become shamefully obsessed with \"trying to liven [things] up a bit\" and thus divert rock music from its true purpose: providing entertainment that values \"complacency and safety\" for middle-aged authors. Their last album, 2005's Open Season, honed British Sea Power's sound into something impressively radio-friendly. But the single Please Stand Up struggled to No 34, proof that the hit parade still isn't dominated by the most worthy discs of the day. At first glance, Do You Like Rock Music? seems bruised by commercial failure. That title looks slightly exasperated, while the choice of producers - including Graham Sutton, of post-rock pioneers Bark Psychosis, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor co-founder Efrim Menuck - suggests a defiant retreat from the mainstream. The album opens with a ambiguous paean to the singalong collective experience that recently seems to have become rock's main raison d'etre. \"We're all in it and we close our eyes,\" it intones, but the music is troubled and fidgety, buffeted by gusts of guitar and bursts of white noise: it sounds like an anxious rumination on whether it's possible to attain mass appeal without sacrificing your edginess and originality. Time will tell, but the rest of Do You Like Rock Music? sounds like an affirmative answer. It finally manages to harness British Sea Power's immense, edge-of-chaos live sound to brilliant songs: the album seems neither glossy nor wilfully abstruse, just exciting. Surging from a lulling piano introduction into a gale of panic-stricken guitars, Atom sounds less like a song than an outbreak of mass hysteria with a chorus so irresistible even certain grumpy old authors might join in despite themselves. The Great Skua is a more majestic and beautiful instrumental than its titular bird deserves, given that it's an avian hoodie that mugs other birds for food. No Lucifer is a magnificent three-minute pop song, albeit one built, improbably, around Big Daddy's victory chant of \"Ea-sy! Ea-sy!\" As the latter two examples suggest, British Sea Power's singular worldview remains happily intact. They're not the sole band to currently find themselves trembling with the apocalyptic heebie-jeebies, but they're the only ones to express their disquiet using the 1953 Canvey Island flood as a metaphor. Waving Flags, meanwhile, offers precisely the kind of stirring anthemics that cause festival crowds to close their eyes and believe they're all in it. Its euphoria is anchored in something specific rather than vague keep-your-chin-up generalities: the listener is invited to punch the air in celebration of the influx of East Europeans into Britain, praising them both for their work ethic and their heroic capacity for alcohol: \"Are you of legal drinking age? On minimum wage? Well, welcome in from across the Vistula.\" It's hard not to think that this is a more humane response than whining to the NME about the gates of England being flooded. It's equally hard not to think that a band capable of turning the issue of economic migration into something that thousands of people could happily bellow along to is a pretty remarkable entity. Whether the general public will agree is debatable, but they should: Do You Like Rock Music? is the glorious sound of a unique band going for broke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
