But he is sure of one thing : he wants genuine offenders found and punished. All inquiries after Murray\u2019s straight sets victory over 18-year-old Alexander Zverev in the first round here on Tuesday were trained on the topic that has spread through the tournament like a virus for two days: allegations by the BBC and BuzzFeed that eight players in the draw had been suspected in the past of involvement in match-fixing. The world No2 described match-fixing as a \u201cmassive problem\u201d and called for anyone found guilty of the offence to be banned. He also questioned how right it was for betting companies to sponsor tournaments, with the BBC-BuzzFeed allegations bringing scrutiny on the Australian Open\u2019s partnership with William Hill. He described it as \u201ca little bit hypocritical\u201d and called for the tennis authorities to do more in terms of education and transparency. The unnamed offenders are said to include a grand slam champion, although there has been no indication of who it might be or if the athlete is even still playing, and there is resentment in the higher circles of tennis administration that these claims have not only taken the gloss off the first slam tournament of the season, but the initial story did not produce names or concrete proof of illegal behaviour. The counter argument is that they have been timid in their pursuit of transgressors for fear of losing sponsors. Murray sees both sides of the argument. For years he has been unforgiving in his condemnation of past offenders and classes the use of performance-enhancing drugs alongside tanking as crimes which can only leave a deep bruise on the sport\u2019s image. \u201cBoth are massive concerns to any sport,\u201d said Murray following his 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 win against German Zverev. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that to go on. But it does. No sports are clean of doping and none are clean of fixing. And it\u2019s not just sport. That\u2019s, like, life in general. People cheat. A lot of people cheat in other jobs as well. People do it in relationships as well. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, when it does happen, you want people to be prosecuted, you want them to be banned and you want them to be found out. I, as a player, can\u2019t ban people. It\u2019s up to the authorities to do something about it. And you just want to make sure that they are.\u201d Warming to the theme of retribution, Murray said he could not judge whether the game\u2019s administrators are shying away from hunting down offenders or not \u2013 as is alleged in the BBC-BuzzFeed investigation \u2013 but he added: \u201cStories like this, although they\u2019re tough for sports, it does force them to react, maybe do more about it, invest more in the Tennis Integrity Unit and doping programmes. Although [administrators] don\u2019t necessarily want to hear about tennis or their own sport being involved in anything like this, it can be positive in some ways, as well, if they react properly. \u201cThe thing is, prosecuting and having the right evidence to be able to do that \u2026 I\u2019m sure the betting companies are pretty aware of everything that\u2019s going on. They know when they see something that\u2019s not quite right. Having enough evidence to prosecute \u2013 from what I\u2019ve been told \u2013 is very difficult. But I don\u2019t think that they would be lying for the sake of it. I think they know when something\u2019s not quite right.\u201d While Murray acknowledges betting companies\u2019 role in providing information on suspicious betting patterns, he clearly feels the role they play as tournament sponsors does not sit well with the rules and responsibilities of global tennis. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit hypocritical,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not really pro that, I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t believe the players are allowed to be sponsored by betting companies but then the tournaments are. I don\u2019t really understand how it all works. I think it\u2019s a bit strange.\u201d He added: \u201cI do think it\u2019s important that, from a younger age, players are better educated and are made more aware of what they should do in those situations and how a decision like that can affect your career, can affect the whole sport. I think you should be learning about those things from 15, 16, 17 years old and being warned about it.\u201d Speaking before Fernando Verdasco\u2019s shock defeat of Rafael Nadal, whom Murray was scheduled to meet in the semi-finals, he declared himself satisfied with his performance against Zverev. But he acknowledged that Sam Groth, whom he and Jamie Murray beat when the big server combined with Lleyton Hewitt in the doubles of the Davis Cup semi-finals in Glasgow last year, will be a far tougher opponent in Thursday\u2019s second round match. Groth had a playful dig after beating the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, hoping Murray would honour his pledge to abandon the tournament the moment he learns his wife, Kim, is about to give birth to their first child. \u201cIt would be nice if his wife went into labour overnight!\u201d Groth said. \u201cI might be just cheering for that one. But, no, no, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. He\u2019s going to be tough. He\u2019s a quality player. He\u2019s where he is for a reason. Hopefully I will serve well and it doesn\u2019t come back. I\u2019m going to take it to him.\u201d Murray revealed he has been on edge waiting for news from London about the impending birth. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since she has not been with me at a slam. This morning I ordered room service and I got a phone call to my room that woke me up \u2013 and I completely panicked. I answered the phone and they were, like: \u2018We\u2019re just at your door with the room service.\u2019 I just couldn\u2019t hear them knocking at the door.\u201d He will have no such trouble hearing Groth\u2019s thunderbolts on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
