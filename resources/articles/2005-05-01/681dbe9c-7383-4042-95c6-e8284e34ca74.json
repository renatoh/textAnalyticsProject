In my constituency, Dagenham, in east London, it polled 9.3% of the vote. Next door in Barking, it polled 16.9%. Its position across the country needs careful analysis. The reduction of Labour's majority to 66 will ensure that about 40 super-marginal constituencies determine policy development and political organisation in the next four years. The politics of middle England will become even more dominant in the minds of our political leadership. The danger is that we ignore the reasons for the strength of the BNP, and in so doing reinforce the conditions that have created this situation. Over the past couple of years, our area has become the fastest-growing and the fastest-changing community in London. The key driver has been the private housing market - we have the lowest-cost housing in London. Until a couple of years ago, it would have been described as white working class. The borough was built on the principle of socialised housing. Yet the effect of \"right to buy\" has left many thousands in need. At the same time, it has an enduring legacy of poverty and underinvestment in public services. The stark collision between our legacy and the scale of change, with this rapid diversification fracturing identity and community cohesion, has created a rich seam for the BNP. Government policies, skewered to the political priorities of middle England, cannot even begin to remove local concerns about change. Much of the community feels disenfranchised by New Labour, which has consciously removed class as a political or economic category. It has devised policies to appeal to specific swing voters in marginal constituencies - witness the genealogy of the choice agenda in terms of public service reform. Camping on the centre ground ensures New Labour hegemony. The cornerstone of New Labour has been the fundamental assumption that people in communities like Dagenham have nowhere else to go. Yet the white working class is beginning to develop an allegiance with the far right; the Labour party has, in their eyes, deserted them. The other hallmark of New Labour, the methodology of triangulation, compounds these tensions. Take one example, immigration. Over the past few years, we have seen an ever more muscular political debate. The government has never attempted to annunciate a clear set of principles that embrace the core concept of immigration - its associated economic and social dynamic, its role in helping overcome structural productivity and pensions problems - or even embraced the psychology of the migrant when looking at school attainment, our general work ethic or patterns of benefit consumption. Instead, the debate has moved rightwards. At the same time, people see how the government has tacitly used immigration to help develop its preferences for a flexible North American-style labour market. In the service sector, construction and civil engineering, for example, immigration has been used as an informal reserve army of cheap labour. People see this at their workplace, feel it in their pocket and see it in their community - and therefore perceive it as a critical component of their own relative impoverishment. Objectively, the social wage of many of my constituents is in decline. House prices rise inexorably, and public service improvements fail to match local population expansion. At work, their conditions, in real terms, are in decline through the unregulated use of cheap migrant labour. Migrant labour is the axis of our whole domestic agenda, but New Labour cannot articulate a New Britain and genuinely discuss social and economic modernisation - it cannot even stand up to a rancid Tory election campaign. Some see triangulation as tactically smart, yet it undermines any durable progressive consensus as it entrenches the method by which political elites stigmatise the most vulnerable. Political debate is carried out by rich, educated elites who do not live in communities changing dramatically through this process of immigration. The most wretched element of the debate is the way these elites and their cohorts in the press ramp up tensions in the communities that are actively attempting to deal with the whole process. At the same time, these very communities are the most ill equipped to deal with the changes because they are the poorest and have the most limited opportunities for economic and social mobility. The mixture of class, poverty and race, together with changes in the housing and labour markets and the demonisation of the migrant, creates a perfect storm for the BNP. Yet it also creates the context for all that is great in the human condition to step forward. Despite conditions that help the BNP - and a national debate that panders to xenophobic politics - the local working classes are resisting the obvious far-right responses. In Dagenham, as in similar communities across the country, a new popular front politics is developing as anti-fascists, church groups, local union branches, and voluntary and political groups come together to confront the threat. New alliances are being formed; old structures are being revitalised. A new, assertive, labour-movement politics is being fashioned. What is striking, at local level, is that those who are articulating a modern world view are the same parts of the old Labour party that at national level have been caricatured as belonging to a previous epoch. The labour movement is organically rebuilding and taking on the fascists street by street. Over the past few months, hundreds have mobilised and developed new forms of local social solidarity and community activity. This is a long march, but over time it will deal with the BNP - and through the same process enrich and democratically rebuild a community and a political movement. \u00b7 This is an edited version of an article in the current issue of Tribune \u00b7 Jon Cruddas is the Labour MP for Dagenham and a former Downing Street adviser cruddasj@parliament.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
