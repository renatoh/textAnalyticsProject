She was hired as a dancer, because the company already had a powerful singer in Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey. Rainey, perhaps the most significant female blues singer of the first generation, was also one of the first African-American women to record. She had her own sound, a mix of an almost operatic power and the rough, moaning style drawn from early black folk music. Rainey taught the talented teenager Smith stagecraft and confidence and she went on to become the most acclaimed jazz/blues singer of her generation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
