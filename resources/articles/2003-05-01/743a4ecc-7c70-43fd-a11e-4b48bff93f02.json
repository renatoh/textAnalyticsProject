Born in London in 1870 but orphaned when he was six, he was brought up by an uncle and aunt in the large Irish country-house that had been his mother's childhood home. The well-known but always puzzling story Leonard Piper tells in this brisk, thoughtful and fluent biography is of a fervently patriotic boy from the English upper-middle class and the old Protestant ascendancy in Ireland, who became an equally fervent supporter of Irish independence and ended up in front of an Irish firing-squad as an IRA rebel. The Riddle of the Sands is set in the Frisian Islands off Germany's North Sea coast, and was intended as much to warn the British of their vulnerability to a German invasion as to entertain its readers. It is written with the cool humour and sense of effortless superiority which, at the apogee of their empire, distinguished the British from all other nations, and was an immediate and lasting success. Childers had been to public school and Cambridge and later took part in the Boer war as a City Imperial Volunteer. His account of the experience, In the Ranks of the CIV, based on his letters home, was published in 1900. Between leaving Cambridge and going to South Africa, Childers had discovered the pleasures of sailing and pursued it, like everything he did, with the obsessive concentration he gave to his character Davies in the novel. In this early phase of his life, however, he was still able to see himself objectively and ironically, for the other main character, Carruthers (a more conventional alter ego), tells the story and, at any rate to begin with, turns a jaundiced eye on Davies: \"Even in the dim gaslight he clashed on my notions of a yachtsman - no cool white ducks or neat blue serge; and where was the snowy-crowned yachting cap, that precious charm that so easily converts a landsman into a dashing mariner?\" Childers's own obsession gradually turned from sailing to working for Irish independence - he was briefly Liberal MP for Devonport with a passion for Irish Home Rule incomprehensible to his constituents. He was able to combine the two in 1914 when, in order to offset the gun-running of the Ulster loyalists, he helped to buy in Germany and smuggle to Ireland on his own yacht rifles and ammunition for the nationalists in Southern Ireland. The committee of liberal-minded Anglo-Irish Protestants - among them the British diplomat Sir Roger Casement, later executed for treason - which Childers had joined did not apparently intend the rifles to be actually used, but merely to help level the playing-field between South and North. Leonard Piper is particularly sharp and cogent in writing about the political issues involved in his story. Childers's gun-running adventure ended successfully the day before Austria declared war on Serbia. Childers immediately reverted to being the gung-ho English patriot who had written The Riddle of the Sands. And because he had written it, he was summoned at the behest of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to prepare a plan for invading one of the Frisian Islands. The plan, on which Childers worked night and day \"with total commitment\", was filed and the assistant director of naval operations, who had set Childers the task, noted: \"It is quite mad. The reasons for capturing it are NIL, the possibilities about the same. I have never read such an idiotic, amateur piece of work as this outline in my life.\" But better things were in store. Childers joined the new naval airforce, flying seaplanes carried on converted ferries (the first \"aircraft-carriers\") and lowered into the sea on cranes. He was supposed to teach the pilots navigation but contrived to join many of the reconnaissance and torpedoing missions against the German navy in the North sea as navigator himself. Transferred later to the Dardanelles, then to the Suez Canal approaches, he became for a while a character out of the Biggles books rather than Buchan, winning the DSO for his exploits. The war over, Childers was a victim of the deadly influenza epidemic and barely survived. There were psychological problems too. Intolerance, pigheadedness and \"an addiction to danger that amounted almost to a death-wish\" gripped him. Piper's account of the complicated political and military manoeuvres which finally brought him, aged 52, to a bravely dignified death for the cause of a free Ireland at the hands of the Irish Free State, is the best part of a very good book. John Spurling's most recent play, Robinson Crusoe Meets His Maker, was performed at Albany prison last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
