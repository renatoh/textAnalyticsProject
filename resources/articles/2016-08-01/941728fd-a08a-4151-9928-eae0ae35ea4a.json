On Monday video was released showing Rudd criticising the decision, as media reports suggested more cabinet ministers spoke to support Rudd than oppose him before the prime minister and deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, intervened to kill the bid. Turnbull\u2019s position on Rudd\u2019s bid is now highly contested, with treasurer Scott Morrison claiming Turnbull expressed concern in cabinet last week and Rudd claiming the prime minister had supported his bid last year before ultimately reneging on the promise. In a video posted to Facebook by Labor\u2019s federal election candidate for Brisbane, Pat O\u2019Neill, Rudd described Turnbull as a \u201cbrick wall\u201d who stood in the way of his ambition to become UN secretary general. Speaking at a Young Labor event in Brisbane on Saturday, Rudd warned that hard work doesn\u2019t always guarantee success. \u201cI\u2019ve got a very dark deep secret for you, sometimes it\u2019ll turn to shit and sometimes it won\u2019t turn out perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a modest experience of that, just a little bit, including yesterday ... [it\u2019s] part of the collective scar tissue of life.\u201d Rudd said he had sought to \u201cmake a huge difference\u201d as prime minister, foreign minister and then on the international stage, until he was thwarted by a \u201cbrick wall\u201d in the form of Turnbull. On Tuesday the Australian Financial Review reported that in the cabinet discussion on Thursday one more minister spoke in favour of Rudd\u2019s bid than against, but Turnbull and Joyce then met separately and decided to veto the proposed nomination. Speaking on ABC\u2019s AM on Tuesday, Shorten said Turnbull had a \u201cfair bit of explaining to do about his actions\u201d, referring to that report. Shorten said the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, had thought she was doing the right thing by backing Rudd \u201cand probably clearly [thought] she had some sort of agreement or some sort of signal from Turnbull it was the right thing to do\u201d. Bishop prepared a cabinet submission knowing the prime minister had some reservations about Rudd, but she proceeded, with consultation, in the expectation that he would follow the bipartisan practice of elevating former prime ministers to international roles. Shorten referred to reports that the department of foreign affairs and trade had backed Rudd\u2019s bid and to Rudd\u2019s own recollections, in the form of letters he released documenting his claims that Turnbull gave him private undertakings supporting his nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Mr Turnbull has put his own political survival ahead of prior positions he may have had,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as this for me: the rightwing puppet masters of Mr Turnbull\u2019s government pulled the strings, and he has danced to the string pulling.\u201d Conservative critics of Rudd\u2019s bid included the treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton. On Monday Turnbull avoided direct questions about whether he had ever supported Rudd\u2019s ambition to be the UN secretary general, arguing his conversations with the former Labor prime minister were private. Turnbull said some of Rudd\u2019s correspondence was \u201cat odds with my recollection\u201d, contradicting his account of one meeting in December at which Rudd claimed Turnbull supported his bid. But when asked whether he had given him support at other times, the prime minister said he would not \u201cdebate\u201d Rudd about confidential conversations. Asked on Radio National on Tuesday about reports he backed Bishop\u2019s support of Rudd\u2019s bid, the attorney general, George Brandis, refused to disclose cabinet deliberations but said he supported the prime minister\u2019s decision. \u201cAn orthodox cabinet process means every member of cabinet supports every decision of cabinet, and I adhere to that process,\u201d he said. Brandis described Rudd\u2019s correspondence as \u201cself-serving\u201d and noted he had not released Turnbull\u2019s replies. \u201cThe irony is that the people who are now crying crocodile tears over the fate of Mr Rudd are the very people in the Labor party who decided he wasn\u2019t fit to be the prime minister of Australia.\u201d The conservative senator Cory Bernardi, an outspoken critic of Rudd\u2019s bid, has claimed that Labor frontbenchers have thanked him for opposing Rudd. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many emails, I\u2019ve had so many text messages and phone calls of support from Labor frontbenchers saying \u2018thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you \u2013 this bloke would have done enormous damage to Australia\u2019s international relations\u2019,\u201d he told Sky News on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
