She fails, of course. It's all very sad, because she deserves better. But it's hard to see how her author could have done more for her without breaking with the grim middle-way realism that is her hallmark. The heroines of her new novel are luckier. They inhabit an unbounded, transcultural world where the dead wander among the living, endowing even the grimmest and most middle-class corners of north London with an epic grandeur. \"This book was inspired by a volume of court memoirs written in Korea more than two centuries ago,\" Drabble informs us in her preface. Without stopping to say who the author was, other than that she was a crown princess, she confesses to being obsessed by her: \"Once I had met her, I could not get her out of my mind... She seemed to be making demands on me, but it has not been easy to work out what they might or could be.\" In the end, she decided to turn her story into a \"novel, of a kind. This is because I am a novelist, and, for better and for worse, writing novels is what I do.\" But she's worried that we might take this one the wrong way, \"for attempting to write across cultures is dangerous and liable to misinterpretation\". So we are to bear in mind that this is not a historical novel and that she does not believe in ghosts. With that, she hands over to the crown princess, who will be our guide for the next 166 pages. She is as imperious as Drabble and just as odd. Although her account of court intrigues is utterly gripping, she refuses to confine herself to the language of her time. She'll describe how King Yongjo took her aside as a young girl to tell her \"to keep her linen white\" because \"men do not like the red smear\". The young crown princess is confused, so the older, wiser memoirist feels compelled to put things in perspective. \"I now think, with the benefit of maturity and an afterlife, and in the light of my readings of 19th- and 20th-century anthropological and psychoanalytical literature, that he was speaking of men's fear of menstrual blood.\" As we soon discover, even erudite ghosts in coy postmodern sagas have their limits: for while the crown princess can influence the present and use its libraries to study the past, she cannot converse with the living or force them to follow her preferred course of action. But she's desperate to make sense of her life and play out her destiny: to this end, she chooses an \"emissary\", who becomes the heroine of the second half of the book. Dr Babs Halliwell is a svelte, brilliant, Orpington-born academic en route to Seoul to give a paper at a very important conference. During the first half of her journey, she amuses herself with a book entitled Multiculturalism: Is It Bad for Women?. During the second half, she reads a mysterious book sent to her via Amazon from parties unknown: a thick academic tome from a small press entitled A Message From the Crown Princess of Korea, in the Form of a Court Memoir of the Eighteenth Century, translated, edited and annotated by Thea O Landry. It entrances her - of course. And so the game begins. Perhaps I should put that into the plural, for in the second half of the novel, the author has just as much fun with her readers as the crown princess has with poor Babs. Deliberately hectoring (\"She will arrive too early at the airport. She always arrives early at airports. It is foredoomed that she will arrive early at Heathrow\") and intensely annoying, she still insists on being heard. Long after she has given you a headache, you read on and on, faster and faster, if only to find out what the hell she's up to. Well, that's not quite fair. Behind the literary games is an implausible but gorgeously trashy romance. I lapped that up, too - without anyone being the wiser. Rarely has feminist escapism been so stylishly disguised. \u00b7 Maureen Freely's books include The Parent Trap (Virago)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
