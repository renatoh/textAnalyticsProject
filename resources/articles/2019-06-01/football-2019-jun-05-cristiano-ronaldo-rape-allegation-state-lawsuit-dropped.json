Kathryn Mayorga, who came forward with her story last year, claims the Juventus and Portugal star used \u201cfixers\u201d to stop her pursuing criminal charges, including paying her $375,000 to keep quiet. She has alleged Ronaldo assaulted her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. On Wednesday, one of Mayorga\u2019s lawyer emphasized the case had only been dropped at state level so that it could be moved to federal court. Mayorga\u2019s lawyers have said it has been difficult to serve papers for the state lawsuit to Ronaldo as he lives in Europe. It is thought that it will be easier to serve papers involving a federal case. \u201cThe charges were not dropped,\u201d Larissa Drohobyczer told ESPN. \u201cThe state case was dismissed by us because we filed the identical claims in federal court due to federal court\u2019s rules on serving foreigners. We basically just switched venues, but the claims remain.\u201d Las Vegas police confirmed to the Guardian in an email that their investigation remains open. \u201cThe LVMPD criminal investigation involving Cristiano Ronaldo is still ongoing,\u201d wrote a spokesperson. Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer, Peter Christiansen, declined to comment on the case on Wednesday. Ronaldo has denied Mayorga\u2019s allegations. \u201cI firmly deny the accusations being issued against me,\u201d he said in October 2018. \u201cRape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense. My clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.\u201d Ronaldo, 34, is one of the most famous athletes in the world. He is a five-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, an annual award for the best footballer in the world. He is also a national hero in Portugal, and led his country to the European Championship title in 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
