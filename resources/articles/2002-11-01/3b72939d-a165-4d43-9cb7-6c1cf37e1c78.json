He has pulled out of the Portugal squad to meet Scotland tomorrow after being injured in Saturday's 2-1 win over Southampton. It is worrying news for the Tyneside club, who have already lost their France winger Laurent Robert until next month after sustaining a cheekbone fracture. The 19-year-old Viana had proved the ideal replacement for Robert on the left side of midfield and the Newcastle manager Sir Bobby Robson now has a major problem for Saturday's match away to Manchester United as well as the Champions League game with Internazionale in seven days' time. Viana left the field eight minutes before the end of Satruday's game, after having laid on the winner for Aaron Hughes, and immediately had his knee packed in ice. There was no comment from Newcastle last night - but the teenager may not be back in action before Christmas, and Robert is not due to return until Newcastle face Aston Villa on December 7. \u00b7 The Scotland manager Berti Vogts appears to have embarked on a collision course with the country's big two clubs in the run-up to tomorrow's international after he criticised the Celtic manager Martin O'Neill last night. O'Neill had suggested that Scotland would benefit more from an England-style get-together rather than travelling to Portugal for a friendly. But Vogts took the advice badly, saying: \"O'Neill has a job to do for Celtic and I have a job to do for Scotland. I don't tell him what he has to do at his club. I will continue to take every international date I can. My players need the experience.\" At the weekend Vogts criticised the Rangers manager Alex McLeish, who had insisted that his captain Barry Ferguson had a pelvic injury and was not fit to play for Scotland. Ferguson then turned out for his club in the 2-2 draw at Aberdeen on Saturday and scored the fourth goal from the penalty spot. The situation was eventually resolved by a phone call from the player, who told Vogts that, while he had been struggling through with the Ibrox club, Portugal would have been a game too many. Vogts accepted that and maintained: \"I have no problem with Rangers.\" O'Neill and McLeish are likely to be dismayed at what they see as the German's hard line on international call-ups. Of 10 internationals this season five are friendlies, and Vogts has also arranged a series of B and Under-21 matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
