The body was found at 2pm on Saturday just off the A4212 between Bala and Trawfynydd, Snowdonia, by a couple who were walking in the area. The area, known as Cwm Prysor and close to the Tryweryn reservoir, was sealed off yesterday while detectives carried out an extensive search. Last night a small tent stood over the spot where the body was found. North Wales police have not named the woman, thought to be in her 20s, but a spokeswoman for the force said the death was being treated as suspicious. A Home Office pathologist visited the scene and the postmortem examination was being carried out yesterday, with the results expected later in the week. A North Wales police spokeswoman said: \"We are treating the death as suspicious. \"The body of a semi-naked woman was found by a couple walking in the area. \"We are not prepared to release any information about the condition of the body at this time. \"The results of a post mortem are expected tomorrow and we will know more then.\" People in Bala, just a few miles from where the body was found, were shocked by the discovery. One resident, Richard Thomas, 43, said: \"It is terrible. No one can believe that something like this could happen here. \"That poor girl, and no one seems to know who she is.\" Sara Matthews, 67, from nearby Corwen, said: \"I come to Bala quite a lot because it's such a nice place. You never hear of this sort of thing happening and it is very worrying.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
