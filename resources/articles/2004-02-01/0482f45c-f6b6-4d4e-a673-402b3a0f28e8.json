The law of averages suggests they'll beat them sooner or later but Claudio Ranieri's players mustn't think like that going into tomorrow's match. Mentally and tactically they will need to be spot on if that run's going to finish. The mental issue's a big one because without sorting it out everything else is meaningless. In the FA Cup last weekend I thought Chelsea had this complex that somehow they weren't going to defeat Arsenal. They'd done well in the first half, got themselves into pole position and then didn't carry it through. Too many players went missing. Ranieri needs to get it into his team's heads that they can do it. He should remind them how well they performed for 45 minutes on Sunday and press home that they have to do the same right to the death at Stamford Bridge tomorrow. Man for man, there's little between the sides and Ranieri can reassure them about that. If a linesman had been on the ball and hadn't ruled out Jesper Gronkjaer's header, Chelsea might well have won the Cup game. The margins are that slim. It's a real test of Chelsea's character to show that. Chelsea have plenty of big players who ought to be steaming to avenge the Cup defeat and there's another carrot in that this is a huge game for the club. They can't afford to lose if they're going to have a realistic chance of the title. A draw wouldn't be disastrous but Arsenal would be happier with that. If Chelsea win, the impetus could carry them towards the finishing line. There's probably more resting on this game for Ranieri than for anyone. It could be his last chance to beat Arsenal, assuming they don't meet in Europe. I don't go along with that business that he's got a contract until 2007. Unless Chelsea win the Premiership or Champions League, I think that's it for him. The club are entitled to expect something on the table after all the money they've spent. Similarly, Ranieri's entitled to demand a big improvement from Claude Makelele. The midfielder was bought for a big fee to win big matches and he's got to start delivering again. That means winning more tackles and popping the ball off quickly, like he was doing when he first came to the club. Last weekend I thought he was noticeable by his absence. Makelele might well be tired but, rather than feeling sorry for himself, he's got to pull his finger out. I've read comments from him complaining about the number of games he's playing but that's tough. Patrick Vieira does it for Arsenal and Makelele needs to match Vieira's influence week-in, week-out. He's probably finding he can't cruise through some matches the way he could at Real Madrid. Tomorrow, Ranieri should ask Makelele to get close to Dennis Bergkamp and make it a minefield for the Dutchman. Bergkamp's cunning is so important to Arsenal and he's had a fresh wind this season. Makelele would still be able to get into Vieira at times and Scott Parker showed he's not afraid to contest 50-50s with the Arsenal captain. Another key for Chelsea will be how effectively they block up Arsenal's left-hand side, particularly as Thierry Henry is expected back. Arsenal predominantly attack down there with interplay between Henry, Ashley Cole and Robert Pires. Although Cole will be missing with injury tomorrow, the understudy Gael Clichy also likes to get forward. I would tell the right-back - Mario Melchiot would be my choice - not to desert his post. A lot of teams in the Champions League keep their right-back deep to guard against Henry and I think Chelsea have to do the same, even at home. Then it's up to whoever plays at right midfield for Chelsea to do their stuff defensively. Chelsea could do with Damien Duff back on the left but if he's not fit, I'd go with: Geremi, Parker, Makelele and Frank Lampard. If Chelsea are clever they can exploit Clichy's bursts upfield. I'd ask one of the strikers, probably Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, to drift into areas that the left-back vacates. That puts a threat on Clichy. Chelsea will be saying: \"If you go forward we can hit you on the rebound\" and then it becomes a battle of wills. Chelsea's second striker mustn't play right up against the Arsenal centre-halves. Adrian Mutu or Eidur Gudjohnsen should drop a little deeper. Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Sol Campbell like people standing up against them. They have their problems when people play off the front, as we saw when Mutu got his goal last weekend. Arsenal might be unbeaten in the Premiership, but they're not unbeatable. If Chelsea believe in themselves they can make it 16th time lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
