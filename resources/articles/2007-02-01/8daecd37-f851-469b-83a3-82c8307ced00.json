So absurd has the situation become that the allegation of anti-semitism is even made when Jews disagree among themselves. That is why the suggestion by Alvin Rosenfield that \"anti-Zionism is the form that much of today's anti-semitism takes\" needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt. One of the consequences of this abuse of the term \"anti-semitism\" is to devalue the currency. It renders it almost meaningless because people assume that allegations of anti-semitism are merely the last-ditch resort of those who are incapable of defending the Apartheid Wall that separates the people of the West Bank from their land, the bulldozing of civilian houses, the wanton destruction of olive groves and crops, to say nothing of the theft of their land. Anti-semitism today is not a mainstream form of racism. It is asylum seekers, Muslims and black people who face stop-and-search, control orders and racial profiling, not Jewish people. When anti-semitism was at its height in the 1930s, the US Congress all but removed the right of Jewish refugees to enter the United States. In October 2004, Congress passed a Global Anti-semitism Review Act to assess the record of governments throughout the world. And how does the political establishment define anti-semitism? A good clue has come from the EU Monitoring Committee's working definition which says that examples of anti-semitism could include: Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour. There was a time when the idea that Jews formed a nation apart, be they French, British, Turkish, etc, was in itself the preserve of anti-semites who held that Jews could not be part of the host nations. Anti-semitism has become the \"anti-racism\" of the political right, a means of defaming supporters of the Palestinians and not least Jewish anti-Zionists who, like anti-Nazi Germans, are derided as \"self-haters\". Yet on March 10 at the annual conference of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, there is a motion from myself and Sue Blackwell, an academic at Birmingham University and the person who moved the boycott of Israeli universities at the Association of University Teachers' Conference 18 months ago, to have nothing to do with a small group titled Deir Yassin Remembered [DYR], whose policies have become increasingly anti-semitic. Years of being labelled \"anti-semitic\" have caused a small minority of the Palestinians' supporters to adopt the ideas of \"Jewish power\" and anti-semitic conspiracy theories. When Israel claims that its actions are taken on behalf of Jewish people as a whole, there are those on the other side who are now prepared to take them at their word. The British Director of DYR, Paul Eisen, has penned three essays - Jewish Power, The Holocaust Wars (a tribute to Nazi apologist and Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel who was sentenced last week to five years in a German prison for inciting racial hatred and defaming the memory of the dead) and In Clear Sight of Yad Vashem. The latter essay argues ... Over the last 50 years, revisionist scholars have amassed a formidable body of substantial evidence, which runs in direct opposition to the traditional Holocaust narrative. \"Where is the evidence,\" they say, \"for this alleged gargantuan mass-murder? Where are the documents? Where are the traces and remains? Where are the weapons of murder?\" Eisen's views regarding Holocaust denial are quite clear. Among DYR's supporters is Gilad Atzmon, a musician whose album, Exile, won the BBC Jazz Album of the Year in 2003. In an email to me of June 6, 2005, he described Eisen's Holocaust Wars as a \"great text\". Atzmon, although not himself a Holocaust denier, is certainly a believer in the world Jewish conspiracy theory. In his web article, On Anti-semitism he wrote: \"We must begin to take the accusation that the Jewish people are trying to control the world very seriously.\" After attention was drawn to this quote, Atzmon changed \"Jewish people\" to \"Zionists\" but the in the context of his argument the meaning is clearly the same. [Atzmon's response to previous criticism on this point can be found here. - Ed] This was why, when the Socialist Workers Party first invited Atzmon to give a talk at their Bookmarks bookshop in London in June 2005, a large picket was organised by Jews Against Zionism. We were joined by members of the Jewish Socialists Group and other anti-racists, Jewish and non-Jewish. The picket had a simple theme: \"Anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism\". It was this that brought the problem of anti-semitism in a small section of the Palestine solidarity movement to public attention, not the Zionist movement who prefer to attack anti-Zionists rather than anti-Semites. We were and are surprised that the Socialist Workers Party, which previously had a good record on fighting fascism and anti-semitism should invite Atzmon to its conferences and rallies. In his speech on November 22, 2006 to the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Atzmon explained that it is Jewishness that is the problem. In a telling analogy, he compared Jewish anti-Zionists in the Palestine solidarity movement to exiled German dissidents in Britain during the second world war, i.e. outsiders and strangers. Ironically Zionists, too, believe that Jews are strangers in other peoples' lands. Until the second world war anti-Zionism was the majority current among world Jewry. It wasn't anti-Zionists but the founder of Zionism, Theodore Herzl, who wrote that \"anti-semitism too probably contains the Divine will to Good, because it forces us to close ranks, unites us through pressure, and through our unity will make us free\" [Diaries, p. 231]. Even today, the headquarters of the British Zionist Federation, Balfour House, is named after Arthur James Balfour, the anti-semite who introduced the 1905 Aliens Act to keep Jews out of Britain. Contrary to the accusation that anti-Zionism and anti-semitism are one and the same thing, it is Zionism and anti-semitism that share the belief that Jews are strangers in the lands they were born and brought up in. As Israeli novelist AB Yehoshua explained to the Union of Jewish Students: \"Anti-Zionism is not the product of the non-Jews. On the contrary, the Gentiles have always encouraged Zionism, hoping that it would help to rid them of the Jews in their midst. Even today, in a perverse way, a real anti-Semite must be a Zionist.\" (Jewish Chronicle 22.1.82.) The Palestine Solidarity Campaign has an opportunity at its meeting on March 10 to demonstrate that anti-semitism has no place in the Palestine Solidarity Movement by declaring that membership or participation in DYR is incompatible with being a member of PSC. You cannot oppose racism against the Palestinians and turn a blind eye to anti-semitism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
