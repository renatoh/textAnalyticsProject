Dr Badawi, 83, was a leading figure who called for the Muslim community to integrate fully into British life. The director of the human rights group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said Dr Badawi had \"provided unique leadership in a world gone mad\". An imam of the London Regent's Park mosque, principal of the Muslim College in London and chairman of the Council of Mosques and Imams, he had forged close ties with Jewish and Christian leaders. The Prince of Wales, who became friends with Dr Badawi through his interest in Islam, said the cleric's death was both a personal loss and a \"devastating blow\" to the country. \"His brand of wisdom, scholarship, far-sightedness and above all humour has ensured that Zaki played an extraordinarily important role in the life of this country and amongst the Muslim community,\" he said in a statement. \"His presence will be sorely missed but his hard-won legacy will, I hope, provide a fitting tribute to a truly remarkable and warm-hearted man.\" The cleric formed part of a group including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, and chief rabbi, Sir Jonathan Sacks, that issued a statement following the July 7 London bombings declaring faith leaders united in \"resisting and overcoming the evil of terrorism\". But he sparked controversy a month later when he urged women to stop wearing Islamic veils amid fears of a violent backlash against the Muslim community. Sir Iqbal Sacranie, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the organisation offered \"its heartfelt condolences to Dr Badawi's family\". Ahmed J Versi, editor of the Muslim News, said: \"His demise will be a great loss to all the communities. His devotion to interfaith dialogue was unparalleled.\" Dr Badawi was detained at JFK airport in New York last August and was prevented from entering the US. A week later he was given an \"unreserved apology\" and assurances of a visa by the US Embassy in London. The cleric said he had been invited to return to the US straightaway, but officials could not explain why he was turned away from the country. Dr Badawi, born in Egypt in 1922, was the holder of an honorary knighthood and in 2003 was a guest of the Queen at a state banquet for the US president, George Bush."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
