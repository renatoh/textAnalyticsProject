Cuffing season runs from 1 December \u2013 15 January and is said to be the time when single people are more likely to want relationships. Psychology Today reported that pressures from romantic christmas films, family, social media and those festive parties where people ask about your dating life are contributing factors. Some argue there is no solid scientific evidence to this behaviour but others believe you feel more lonely during winter months. But Christmas nights out can be a perfect time to met new people.
