A production of the National Theatre of Scotland, it opened to wonderful notices at the Edinburgh festival in 2006. Since then it has toured the US, Australia, New Zealand, as well as many British towns that rarely see visits from touring theatre companies: Dingwall, Ebbw Vale, Dumfries, Glenrothes. The people of Dingwall saw it at the town's Highland Football Academy; Pitlochry paid witness at an old hydraulics laboratory. That London should come so low down the list - a postscript to New York, Sydney, Toronto and Los Angeles - has been interpreted as Scotland giving the finger to the capital's cultural and political establishment. This is the play, after all, that Alex Salmond commanded to be performed not once but three times to celebrate the opening of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish National Party's first crack at government. And who needs London's sniff of approval when New York is eating from your hand? In fact, the real reason for its metropolitan absence is more theatrical than political. The National Theatre of Scotland rejected an early invitation from the South Bank because the play needs an open arena with the audience banked up on two sides, which neither the Olivier nor the Lyttelton can provide. And so on Friday, better late than never, it begins its one-month London run at the Barbican. In April, I went to see it at the Scottish Exhibition Centre in Glasgow. There's no point in pretending that I didn't know what to expect, but the danger with ecstatic reviews and copious publicity is that they tend to promote in a certain kind of personality (perhaps Scottish, perhaps mine) the thrawn desire to disagree. Ben Brantley, the New York Times critic, wrote of Black Watch that it had arrived \"like a blazing redeemer in the greyness of the current New York theatre season, a cause for hope after a surfeit of microwaved revivals and ersatz musicals . . . a necessary reminder of the transporting power that is unique to theatre\". John Heilpern in the New York Observer said it was \"among the most compelling theatre pieces you could wish to see\". It is as Heilpern says. Black Watch is a compelling play, though not because its stagecraft or theatrical ideas are blazingly original: the idea that the experience of \"ordinary people\" can be told on stage though an episodic mixture of dialogue and song, dancing and marching, is at least as old as Oh! What a Lovely War, first performed by Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in 1963. Ten years later, The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil by John McGrath's 7:84 company documented Highland history, and thrilled crowds in Scottish village halls in an ambitious touring programme that finds an echo in the National Theatre of Scotland's present philosophy, which is to reach audiences beyond cities and proscenium arches. Also, as I walked that April evening to Black Watch's Glasgow venue - a big exhibition hall built over the site of the old Queen's Dock - I remembered the only other play I'd seen so close to the banks of Clyde. Bill Bryden's The Ship filled Harland and Wolff's abandoned engineering shed just over the river in the autumn of 1990. Every night a seeming-ship was built by seeming-workmen and then, at the play's end, seemingly launched, sliding down a slipway before your very eyes. A true coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre - nothing so sensational had been seen in Glasgow since an Edwardian river floated canoes across the stage of the Empire - though it crowned a dramatic memorial to the Glasgow working class that was utterly conventional in its fond characterisation. Nothing new, then, in the techniques in Black Watch; John Tiffany, the play's director, is happy to acknowledge the precedents in his introduction to Burke's script. As for its subject matter, the Iraq war and the politics around it are hardly virgin territory for screenwriters and playwrights. David Hare did Stuff Happens at the National, Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo wrote Guantanamo for the Tricycle. In both, the writers researched real people and real events and then re-created them, more or less scrupulously, within the constrictions of drama. In its origins, Black Watch is no different. In 2004, Vicky Featherstone, the National Theatre of Scotland's artistic director, asked Burke to follow the story of the regiment. That autumn, at American request, a Black Watch battalion had been temporarily redeployed from the relative safety of British-occupied Basra to Camp Dogwood near Fallujah. The move was politically controversial. At Dogwood, the Black Watch came under sustained rocket and mortar fire. In November, three soldiers and an interpreter were killed by a car bomb at a vehicle checkpoint. A month later, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Black Watch was to be amalgamated with five other Scottish regiments to become the Third Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Local outrage ensued. People sometimes forget that Scotland has a strong tradition of militarism - three centuries of blood and death in the British cause that has been made folksy and cuddly by the kilts, pipes and drums of the Edinburgh Tattoo. The Black Watch was first raised as an anti-Jacobite militia in 1725 and its battle honours include Corunna, Waterloo, Arras, Vimy, Passchendaele and almost every major British action in the second world war. Its dark green and blue tartan and its hat feather, the red hackle, make it the most distinctive of Scottish regiments. Given what the British government was asking the Black Watch to do in the desert of Iraq, the decision was seen as a betrayal, a poor piece of bureaucratic judgment that would damage the Black Watch's already sinking morale. This is the story that Burke tells. It could have been told as an anti-war polemic or a fresh enshrinement of a glorious military legend. Both elements are present in the play and the tension between them is never resolved - \"good regiment, bad war\" is the message that some in the audience might take home. Some of the play's power lies in this very opposition, between what armies actually do, which is often brutal, and the attractions of their history and traditions, which are sometimes brave. The officer in the play calls the second \"the Golden Thread\", a kind of ancestor worship inculcated into teenage recruits who may have been attracted in the first place by mystical totems such as red hackles and regimental pipe tunes, which the army describes as \"force multipliers\" (meaning that they help recruitment, or once did). Burke deals fairly with these seductive ideas of identity and never reduces them to a satirical caricature. We see that they continue to hold meaning for young men placed in absurd and terrifying circumstances. But it is Burke's depiction of the young men themselves, brought to life with unsettling veracity by a fine group of actors, that makes Black Watch so illuminating and affecting. In a country that pays its traffic wardens more than its soldiers, where the young sit fatly before their PlayStations, where deference and jump-to-it obedience belong in the museum of behaviours, how do you raise a volunteer army? Where do you look? In the introduction to the published version of the play, Burke writes: \"The army does not recruit well in London or any other big city. Metropolitanism and multiculturalism are not the things that are welded into a cohesive fighting force.\" According to the Ministry of Defence, the army does best in areas of the country that have \"settled communities\": in other words, in white, monoglot places, not necessarily rural, where the old ways of earning money - mining, fishing, textiles, shipbuilding - no longer exist. In Scotland, so Burke says, soldiering and banking (I would add lawyering and teaching) are the only significant indigenous industries to have lasted into the 21st century. The \"settled communities\" that the Black Watch draws on are the city of Dundee and the old counties of Angus, Perthshire and Fife. When I was at school in Fife, our geography books told us that the county we lived in produced coal, linen, linoleum, paper, ships and fish. These made it matter to the world beyond. Very little of this still applies, but since 2003 there has been a trickle of new Fife exports to Iraq, including the three Black Watch men who died at the checkpoint in 2004: Private Scott McArdle, aged 22, from Glenrothes; Private Paul Lowe, aged 19, and Sergeant Stuart Gray, aged 31, both of Dunfermline. Burke, also from Dunfermline, interviewed surviving members of the same battalion (without the army's approval) during his research. Their words make the play. The accents of Fife are caught precisely. The language is brutal. In the opening scene, Cammy (Private Campbell) teases the anti-war folk who describe the army as \"big bullies\". Cammy: \"Well, we'll need to get fucking used tay it. Bullying's the fucking job. That's what we have a fucking army for.\" The action moves back and forth between a Fife pub and Camp Dogwood. There are some funny lines. Inspecting a Dogwood wall that has been plastered with pornography, an officer says, \"It's important that we have a reminder of what we're here fighting for. Porn and petrol.\" Inside a Warrior armoured car, the soldiers pass the time of day by naming the first food they'll eat when they get home. Each man has a turn to name one dish. It has to be Indian. Only after the Indian takeaway menu has been exhausted can they move on to \"Chinky\". A kind of game, like Mornington Crescent. \"Cheese on toast,\" says one man. \"Cheese on fucking toast?\" says another. \"Aye.\" \"You cannay hay cheese on fucking toast.\" \"How fucking no?\" \"Cos you cannay.\" \"How no?\" \"It's no a fucking Indian, is it?\" \"It's fucking food.\" As much as anything else, Black Watch is a requiem for a military system that depended on the bonds of locality and history for its comradeship. Men fight for their regiment, their company, their platoon, their mates. Countries - Britain or Scotland - and governments never come into it. It's easy to imagine what men like these say to each other after their fellow Fifer, Gordon Brown, has got back into his helicopter. Towards the play's end, Cammy's officer tries to persuade him to stay in the regiment. \"It's in the blood . . . It's part of who we are, where we come from,\" the officer says. Cammy replies that people have said that about a lot of things - \"the shipyards, the pits\". Why should the army be any more permanent? \"It's fucking knackered. Don't you think it's knackered, sir?\" The officer answers: \"It takes 300 years to build an army that's admired and respected around the world. But it only takes three years pissing about in the desert in the biggest western foreign policy disaster ever to fuck it up completely.\" The question is: should we mourn its passing? Leaving the play, I thought of my grandfather who served with the Royal Scots in Flanders; at that time, the Royal Scots rather than the Black Watch were what you might call Fife's premium regiment and quite a few of my ancestors were conscripted to it. My grandfather was wounded. He survived far worse scenes than Camp Dogwood. In 1919, he went back to the pits. What I remember about him are his tidy habits and his gentleness: a civilised man among millions who thought and behaved similarly. Something happened to that civilisation long before the Iraq war. The Black Watch's boy-men who fought in it are the legatees of a social destruction that might be grieved over more than the end of a regiment, even though the regiment is among the last survivors of that previous world. \u00b7 Black Watch is at the Barbican, London EC2, from June 20 to July 26.
