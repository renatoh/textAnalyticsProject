This isn't because it is a long or boring book. It is because just about every paragraph will make you wince, pace about the room, or even feel close to tears of rage. I found the following indispensable while reading it: an asthma inhaler, some allegedly soothing aromatherapy oil, and finally a large bottle of gin. This is the problem. Some years ago, Nicholson Baker - who, as you know, is a very talented writer indeed - wrote a piece for the New Yorker about how libraries were abandoning their old card-index catalogues in favour of computerised systems. Big deal, you might think. However, he made an eloquent case for their survival (which I think you can read in his essay collection, The Size of Thoughts ). But he then found out something more worrying: libraries were replacing their newspaper and book collections with microfilmed copies. Fine, you might say: libraries need the space, the paper is disintegrating, and who needs a complete run of the Laramie Republic and Boomerang 1916-49 (103 volumes) anyway? It turns out that such reasoning is flawed, based on false or misleading premises. And Nicholson, with all the intelligence, wit, and doggged monomania that we know is at his command, blows these arguments right out of the water. Let us consider what microfilming a book entails: guillotining the spine, photographing every page - and then throwing every page away. The standard test for whether a volume is sound enough to survive on the shelves is called the Double Fold test. You can do it yourself. You fold a corner of a page back on itself. Then you fold it the other way. Then you give it a tug. Repeat the process. If the paper snaps after a few times (the number depends on which library is performing the operation - it's generally between one and five), it is deemed beyond repair. Only, as everyone who has ever read an old, brittle book or newspaper knows, all such a test tells you is not to go around folding the pages. The book or journal itself, handled gently, can be used indefinitely. Microfilm, though, has only one life. And much of that is now unusable: it spots, tears, or even fuses into a solid, opaque and useless lump. The fact that reading a microfilmed page is itself a drag - and does not reproduce any of the half-tones of, say, a newspaper illustration - is only a secondary point. And as for libraries running out of space - well, when they're not downright fibbing, there are ways around that. That there is a full-sized book in all this, and not just a pamphlet or long essay, shows the scope and nature of the disaster, which Baker summarises neatly thus: \"The truth is that certain purificationally destructive transformations of old things into new things seem to excite people - otherwise polite, educated, law-abiding people - and it's up to other normally polite people to try to stop them.\" He runs into some unlikely characters in his quest to see what can be done. Not just the starry-eyed modernisers and techies at the Library of Congress, but the CIA, Nasa and the military. This isn't sinister - it's just that some of the chemicals and techniques involved in the process are better suited to military and astronautic applications. Meanwhile, information about our past is dribbling, beyond all reach, into the maw of oblivion - tragically, for the best of motives. But the fight starts here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
