Warriner, who today faces Alex Roy after the so-called \"Ace of Herts\" beat Denis Ovens 4-3 in their third-round match, was speaking after the tabloid hype had been cranked up by Peter Manley, the players' association representative, who slated the redoubtable Phil \"The Power\" Taylor as selfish and patronising. \"One Dart\" Manley was reported as saying: \"Phil could put a lot back into the sport and help the younger lads. But with him it is 'I am Phil Taylor. I am God. Why do I have to help other people?'\" But Warriner admitted that he had been badly affected by \"needle\" in last year's showdown with the then defending champion Taylor, after saying their semi-final would be \"like a boxing match\". \"The Power\" then hammered Warriner before losing out to John Part in one of the most memorable finals ever. But Warriner has gone quietly about his business this year and explained: \"I spoke to Peter this morning and he says he didn't really say that much - but he's in the same boat I was in last year. I said a couple of things, was honest about it and suddenly I had full pages in the papers. \"It gives it a bit of needle, which isn't a bad thing, but it did affect me. I played well up until then and I suppose the hype took over. The publicity in this game isn't always the best. When we do get some, we jump on it, that's the most honest thing I can say about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
