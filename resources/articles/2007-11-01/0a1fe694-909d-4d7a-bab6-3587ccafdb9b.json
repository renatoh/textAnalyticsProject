Joe's Palace (BBC1) You're standing on a motorway bridge, watching the traffic zoom by underneath: Vauxhall Vectra, Ford Focus, white van, Audi A3, Eddie Stobart, another Vectra, Polo, white van again. Get the idea? When you watch a lot of television (which I do), it feels a bit like that. With multi-channel TV, this motorway now has a lot of lanes, and loads of traffic coming down them, but much of it is the same. So Corrie is a Vauxhall Vectra; The Jeremy Kyle Show, in your face and brash, is a white van; Footballers' Wives - quite glam, a bit tacky - is a convertible 3-series BMW; Attenborough is a vintage Rolls-Royce. Do you see? It's important to compare everything with cars, I think; it helps you make up your mind about stuff. Anyway, every couple of years or so, something quite different comes along the motorway: one of those extra-wide loads, with flashing lights and a police escort. They crawl along, take up the whole road, holding everything up. And it's not always clear what they're actually carrying. A house? Part of a boat? A bridge? They may be slow, frustrating and mysterious, but they're more interesting than most of the stuff that comes along, and the highlight of any lengthy period on the bridge. To be precise, they are dramas by Stephen Poliakoff, the latest of which is Joe's Palace (BBC1, Sunday). Joe is an innocent, good-natured, trusting boy, who gets a job looking after the mansion of a reclusive billionaire. An unlikely relationship forms. People come and go: a thrusting young politician and his mistress, the girl in the deli (assorted cold meats are involved). And that's kind of it, really. It just trundles along. But it's done so very well - beautifully observed, with fine performances by Danny Lee Wynter as the boy, and sad old dog Michael Gambon as the recluse - that it doesn't really matter. Something does eventually happen. The old man finds out what he always expected, that his riches are tainted by a dark secret from the past. There's a suicide attempt. But if anything, I think this is the least successful bit of Joe's Palace - almost as if it's there just for Something to Happen. But it doesn't need it, perhaps can't even take the excitement. Because Joe's Palace is simply about humanity, and relationships, and loneliness, and the passing of time. It's a shame it clashed with A Room With a View (ITV1, Sunday), because this was the easy option, which many will have opted for, and done so with a clear conscious because they will still have felt they were watching something \"cultured\". And it was good, without being especially interesting. As you'd expect from a lavish ITV adaptation by Andrew Davies, of a classic, it's sexy, looks lovely, has fine performances again (particularly from Elaine Cassidy as Lucy Honeychurch). It seems pretty faithful to Forster and his themes of supressed Edwardian sexuality, true love, class and religion, although there's an inexplicable twist at the end: George dies in the war, Lucy returns to Florence and ends up with the Italian taxi driver. I don't understand why Davies did that - perhaps in an attempt to make it different from the Merchant Ivory film, the one with Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy. It's a long time since I saw that, but apart from the ending, this one doesn't feel so different in spirit. It's girls' television, of course. \"Women like views, men aren't that bothered with them,\" George's father says near the beginning, when offering up their room to Lucy and her prissy aunt. I disagree with him on that. I like views (though not in Florence - ghastly place), and know other men who like them, too. But if you replace the word \"views\" in Mr Emerson's sentence with \"period costume dramas\" then you have something approaching a truth. Oh, and the car thing for A Room With a View (I am a boy, after all). Well it's for girls, and it's attractive, quite racy looking, and tasteful, though not particularly exciting, reasonably expensive . . . Got it! It's one of those little Mercedes sports cars, the SLK. And that works well, because the new one is very much in the spirit of the original, but actually not quite as nice. And the appendage, the inexplicable new ending? So it's a Mercedes with an unnecessary spoiler stuck on the back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
