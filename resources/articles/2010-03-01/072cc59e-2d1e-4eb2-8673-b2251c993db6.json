Although Mancini maintains that he would like Robinho to return to the club in August, the Brazilian has confirmed he has no intention of moving back to Manchester to play for a manager he blames, in part, for his poor form this season. Robinho has already shipped all his belongings to Brazil and instructed his representatives to find him a new club, and after scoring four goals in six games for Santos he has publicly criticised Mancini for the first time since leaving City. He said: \"At City, when I was playing, I knew that at some point the substitution board would go up and I was going to come off because the manager didn't have trust in me. Then, you start to lose your confidence on the pitch.\" Mancini had said he wanted Robinho to \"write the history of the club\" when he replaced Mark Hughes as manager in December but he quickly concluded that the most expensive player in English football, signed from Real Madrid for \u00a332.5m, should be allowed to leave. The Italian also publicly humiliated Robinho by bringing him on as a substitute after Roque Santa Cruz was injured nine minutes into the 2-0 defeat at Everton in January but then withdrawing him 16 minutes into the second half. \"I spoke to the manager after the game,\" Robinho said. \"He admitted to me that he had made a mistake taking me off. It was the first time I have had to go through something like that in my career but I suppose there's always a first time. It wasn't a lack of respect, though. I just think it was a lack of ability on the part of the manager.\" Robinho's form with Santos looks to have earned him a place in Brazil's World Cup squad. He scored in Tuesday's 2-0 win over the Republic of Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
