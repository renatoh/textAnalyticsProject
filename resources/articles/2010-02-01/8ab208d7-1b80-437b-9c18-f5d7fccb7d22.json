The 31-year-old breezed through the 60m final, his trademark acceleration leaving the rest of the field trailing, to take his third consecutive British title. Only 21-year-old Harry Aikines-Aryeetey could get anywhere near him, and even then the former junior world champion had to run a personal best of 6.55 to take second place. Craig Pickering finished in third place, leaving Mark Lewis-Francis \u2013 whose comeback this year had looked so promising \u2013 dejected in fourth. Only two places are up for grabs to compete in Doha, and the 27-year-old's under-par performance has almost certainly blown his chances ahead of the team announcement a week on Monday. Chambers played down any excitement over his world-leading time. \"It's nice but it's still early days,\" said the Londoner. \"I'm sure the Americans are going to come out and do something crazy. It's nice to know I have made the team and I can hopefully focus my attention towards Doha now.\" It has been almost four years since Chambers made his controversial return to the sport following a two-year ban after testing positive for THG in 2003. But since that homecoming the lie of the land has changed significantly. Gone are the endless questions about drugs and the jeers from the crowd. Instead Chambers has been performing consistently and winning medals \u2013 world indoor silver over 60m in 2008, and European indoor gold last year with a European record of 6.42 that confirmed him as the third fastest athlete over 60m of all time. No wonder the public have warmed to him; in Sheffield today his was the only name to get the crowd really cheering. \"I just wish I'd done things a lot better a long time ago,\" said Chambers. \"It's taken me 31 years to realise that, but I'm here and it's made me realise what I almost lost. I'm back here now and getting a lot of support from people, athletes and the general public.\" In only the second event of his season Chambers won all his rounds, having opened his season with 6.57 in Birmingham last weekend. In the women's 60m, veteran sprinter Joice Maduaka claimed her seventh championship win in a season's best time of 7.29, while Greg Rutherford took the long jump title with 7.94m. Injured world champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis was at the track to receive the British Athletics Supporters Club athlete of the year award, and she expressed her frustration at not being able to compete. \"It really is just a precautionary thing,\" she said of the injury to her right foot. \"I strained a ligament but it's not too serious; it's just about being careful at this stage. But I'm absolutely gutted I'm missing today it's really hard sitting on the sidelines not being able to compete.\" The 24 year-old hopes to recover in time to fight for the world indoor pentathlon title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
