Bar\u00e7a, he believes, have the players to reach the final in Moscow on May 21 and he has dismissed suggestions that the Catalans should be daunted by their semi-final opponents, claiming that United's style of football will suit them. The Icelandic international, who started only his eighth league game of the season against Espanyol on Saturday, also dropped the heaviest hint yet that he will walk away from Camp Nou at the end of the season and revealed that Chelsea had prevented him from joining Manchester United two years ago, leaving him to join Barcelona instead. While United close in on a league title, Barcelona waved goodbye to any last lingering hope they had of doing likewise when they could only draw the derby against Espanyol. The goalless result continued a desperate run for Bar\u00e7a, who have won only once in eight domestic games - a solitary victory in four at home, against Valladolid almost a month ago. The final whistle on Saturday prompted a handkerchief-waving protest from supporters furious at a club in crisis. Samuel Eto'o said last night that he too was running out of patience and would leave Bar\u00e7a soon if the club did not start winning trophies again: \"If the next year continues like this, without any titles, I'm finished with this. I'll need to go to another place.\" Gudjohnsen, however, is convinced Barcelona can win against United: \"We know that we haven't played well in the league and I understand the fear our fans have, but what I would say to them is that United know how much talent we have and they fear us. \"In the league we have really lost confidence when we have conceded goals but we haven't conceded many in the Champions League. In the league it's as if we have to score three to win; in Europe it's totally different. For me personally the Champions League is the biggest tournament in the world, especially as it's very hard for me to win anything with my national team. I've been in two semi-finals already and my aim now is obvious. \"I wanted to face United because they're a team that tries to play football and leaves more spaces than other sides do. Liverpool and Chelsea don't have as much talent but they are physically stronger and they play really deep, more defensively; they don't leave so many spaces. I'd rather leave teams like that for the final.\" The Icelander does not feel that Barcelona should be concerned about playing the second leg in Manchester. Asked about Old Trafford's billing as the Theatre of Dreams he could not repress a smile, responding: \"Yeah, it's very nice, but to call it the Theatre of Dreams ... well, it's a bit of an exaggeration. \"It is true that, before I joined Barcelona, United showed an interest in me a couple of times and that's a real honour because Ferguson is a living legend in football, a special person who has done incredible things. It was something like that [Chelsea refusing to sell to a direct rival] but in the end, when I heard Barcelona wanted me, they were my first choice.\" Gudjohnsen, now 29 years old, has rarely started since joining Barcelona in the summer of 2006 and he admitted that he would reconsider his future at the end of the season. \"I've still got two years on my contract and right now I'd rather focus on the matches ahead of us,\" he said, \"but we'll see what happens at the end of the season. It's a big decision and I need to think about my family.\" Hopes pinned on Messi The message from Spain is clear: only Lionel Messi can save Barcelona from defeat against Manchester United. The front page of the Catalan newspaper Sport declared Bar\u00e7a need \"Eleven Messis\", a sentiment widely shared. Messi, back from injury, immediately improved Barcelona against Espanyol, Marca insisting: \"He did more in his first minute than the rest did in the whole game.\" Another headline read: \"Messi makes us dream, the rest just give us nightmares\". Meanwhile, El Mundo Deportivo was fretting over the weather. \"The forecast is for a storm over Barcelona. Will someone please wrap Messi up? If he catches a cold, it's time for our last rites.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
