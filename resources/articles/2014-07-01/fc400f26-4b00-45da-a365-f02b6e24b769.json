No player triggers discussion \u2013 and fury \u2013 over the fine line between clever professionalism and blatant cheating more than this Bayern Munich winger. He is also so heavily relied upon by his international team-mates. That much was clear during the quarter-final with Costa Rica, as the Dutch toiled to find the spark that would undo the spirited men in white and red. When Robben is subdued or shackled, as was the case for long spells of the game, the limitations of this Holland team are highlighted. Robben was at least on hand to score a penalty in the shootout. By close of play he was holding his young son, Luka, aloft in the crowd in a scene of Dutch celebration. Costa Rica\u2019s coach, Jorge Luis Pinto, attempted to pre-empt any acts of Robben felony before a ball was kicked. Pinto claimed he was \u201creally worried\u201d that Robben\u2019s diving could undermine his hopes of continuing Costa Rica\u2019s stunning success in this World Cup. It was a simple managerial tactic, aimed at influencing the mind-set of the referee. That official, Ravshan Irmatov, will have been aware of Robben\u2019s propensity to cry wolf long before he took charge of this Salvador tie. At domestic level, never mind a World Cup, Robben has displayed an infuriating tendency to overshadow his undoubted brilliance with elements of football\u2019s dark arts. Not that Robben is without a defence. No player who utilises trickery and pace to the extent this 30-year-old does needs much contact from an opponent to be knocked over. Robben also apologised for a first-half dive during the last-16 match with Mexico. The late penalty decision awarded in favour of the ex-Chelsea man in that game was ultimately correct, regardless of how much Robben embellished the scenario. Still, it is that very exaggeration as routine which damages Robben\u2019s reputation and alerts those such as Pinto. Five minutes into the Dutch meeting with Costa Rica, Robben was dispossessed 30 yards from his opponents\u2019 goal, lost his footing but returned immediately to his feet without even claiming a foul. Was this a sign of things to come or a reformed on-field personality? It appeared so; Robben was not guilty of falling without a foul at all through 120 minutes. Five players were booked for fouling him. One, Junior Diaz, should have been sent off. The only penalty debate of this game surrounded a Costa Rican player\u2019s tumble, not one by Robben. Robben\u2019s role on the right side of a three-pronged Holland attack, which attempted to press hard on the Costa Rica backline straight from kick-off, was both to create chances for Robin van Persie and provide a scoring threat of his own. The Costa Rica players, for their part, showed Robben on to his weaker side, his right, from the early exchanges. The policy of the underdogs was obvious; to frustrate Van Gaal\u2019s team, including by regular use of an offside trap. It is during taut times that Robben\u2019s dubious side can emerge. It did not again, though, after a challenge from Celso Borges midway through the opening period. Perhaps the Mexican backlash and Pinto\u2019s comments had resonated. Robben was wrongly penalised for a foul on Cristian Gamboa 13 minutes before the interval, when the Costa Rica player slipped on the edge of his penalty area. A Robben break just moments later brought a free-kick, from which the man himself wasted the delivery. A ripple of controversy followed. A smart Robben run was illegally halted by Diaz, who was booked. Robben had leapt theatrically into the air; Wesley Sneijder\u2019s set-piece drew a fine Keylor Navas save. Another Costa Rica yellow card, this time for Michael Uma\u00f1a, was the result of a foul on the marauding Robben, six minutes after the restart. Again there was never any suggestion of understatement from Holland\u2019s No11. By this stage, Holland needed guile and sharpness injected into their attacks; they needed Robben. With an hour gone, all he had displayed were some superb first touches and a hint of danger. Excellent interplay between Robben and Van Persie triggered some desperate Costa Rica defending with 67 minutes played. Later Sneijder cracked a free-kick off Navas\u2019s left-hand post after Robben had been upended. By showing terrific fitness and application Robben continued as the Dutch\u2019s prime attacking outlet into a breathless extra-time period. That much is a tribute to the man himself but does not say much for his team-mates, who laboured. That such discussion takes place at all, rather than one about simulation, is perhaps something to be grateful for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
