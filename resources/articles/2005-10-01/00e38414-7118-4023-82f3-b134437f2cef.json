Boris Tadic wrote in Politika daily that the coalition cabinet of prime minister Vojislav Kostunica was reviving \"political violence\" and \"persecution of opponents\" similar to that which existed during Milosevic's. Mr Tadic's criticism illustrates the deep divisions that prevail among leaders of the anti-Milosevic coalition after the former president was toppled on October 5 2000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
