Over the course of the last 12 months he has endured pain which most of us will never know, and can only hope to be spared. In February, Melissa, his 14-year-old daughter, was killed in a road accident near his old stable in the west country. Three months later his marriage disintegrated and he moved to a new yard in Lambourn but without Shooting Light, the best horse in his string. When Shooting Light won his first three races for Martin Pipe, it was a final twist of the knife. Set alongside such a descent into personal grief and professional misfortune, the victory of Murphy's chaser Supreme Glory in the Welsh National here yesterday may be only a small step on the path back. A step it is, though, and one which may allow him to greet the new year with some of the optimism which the rest of us take for granted. Yesterday's race was only the first part of Murphy's plan for Supreme Glory this season. Now he can look forward and dream of part two - the Grand National at Aintree in April. On yesterday's evidence it is a realistic ambition, though of course one which depends on the handicapper. Most horses are running on empty after 3 miles on soft ground at Chepstow, but despite racing close to a good pace Supreme Glory still had enough in reserve to fly the last fence. That jump ended any lingering hope that Jocks Cross, last year's winner, might repeat his success and Supreme Glory ran on to beat him by two lengths with Bindaree another six away in third. This was the most valuable success of Murphy's career, as it was for Leighton Aspell, the winning jockey. For the trainer, though, triumph can only be relative. \"Somebody rang me after Shooting Light won the Thomas Pink Gold Cup and said 'that must have been painful to watch',\" he said afterwards. \"I told them that the day before I'd sat by my daughter's grave on her 15th birthday. That's what painful is. Watching a horse win a horse race is not painful.\" Yesterday's success was the result of 18 months of planning, and while Supreme Glory is still a few days short of his ninth birthday, Murphy will not pass up the chance to take him to Liverpool for the big race this year. \"We could wait another year, but he's a sound horse, so the plan is to have one more run between now and Aintree,\" he said. \"He's a horse who goes well fresh and we'll probably school him over something like an Aintree fence before then, but we didn't go for the Becher Chase in November because I think that horses go better the first time there.\" The disappointment of the race was See More Business, the 1999 Gold Cup winner, who was never going well and was pulled up before the fourth last. A better performance was that of Philip Hobbs's What's Up Boys, who finished fourth to confirm that the form of his win in the Hennessy is as strong as any in a staying chase this season. Tempo D'Or rose to the top of the ante-post Triumph Hurdle betting after a resolute victory in the Grade One Finale Junior Hurdle, though he needed to be ridden on the turn for home and may not have the tactical speed for the Cheltenham melee. Paddy Power will lay 16-1 to anyone who thinks otherwise, and many punters will recall that Tempo D'Or's trainer, Guillaume Macaire, won the same race last year with Jair Du Cochet, who was a raging favourite for the Triumph before the Festival fi nally succumbed to the foot-and-mouth outbreak. \"He's a really nice horse and this is my race,\" Macaire said. \"The pace was strong today, and I think he will have grown up. He has the same colours as Jair Du Cochet and he will follow the same path. I just hope there is no foot and mouth this year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
