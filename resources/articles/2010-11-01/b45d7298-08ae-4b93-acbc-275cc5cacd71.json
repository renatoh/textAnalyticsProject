Boyd, often derided as a goal hanger during his prolific spell with Rangers, put Tony Mowbray's side 1-0 up against Scunthorpe before his former Celtic counterpart doubled the lead in the first-half. Kris Commons scored his eighth and ninth goals of the season to give Derby County a 2-0 victory over Ipswich at Portman Road and Nigel Clough got the upper hand over his former Nottingham Forest team-mate Roy Keane. Bradley Johnson scored at both ends at Elland Road as Leeds threw away a 2-1 lead with eight minutes to go to draw with Hull City. John Bostock, the talented midfielder on loan at Hull from Tottenham Hotspur, scored the first goal of the game with a blistering shot from 35 yards. Billy Davies, the Nottingham Forest manager, had come into his side's match against Coventry facing criticism from his chairman that he was devoting too little time to the club. But goals from Radoslaw Majewski and Chris Cohen gave him some breathing space in a 2-1 victory over Coventry. Garry O'Connor came off the bench to score an 89th-minute winner for Barnsley in his side's first away league win of the season at Deepdale, a 2-1 defeat for Preston that moved them into the relegation zone. John Marquis scored an even later goal to earn Millwall a point at the New Den after a spirited fight back in the last 10 minutes pegged back Norwich. Crystal Palace remain at the foot of the table but two goals from Owen Garvan earned them a 3-2 win over Watford, Palace's third victory in succession over the Hornets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
