In the report to Unesco\u2019s world heritage committee, the Queensland and federal governments say the reef is \u201can icon under pressure with a deteriorating long-term outlook\u201d. The committee will review the status of the Great Barrier Reef at its June 2020 meeting in China, with the potential to place the reef on its \u201cin danger\u201d list. As part of the process, the committee asked Australia to submit a comprehensive \u201cstate of conservation\u201d report for the reef \u2013 the first since 2015. The report says mass coral bleaching events of 2016 and 2017, together with six tropical cyclones, flood plumes and outbreaks of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish \u201chave impacted the [outstanding universal value] of the property since the last State Party Report in 2015\u201d. \u201cThe size of the property is becoming a less effective buffer to broadscale and cumulative threats, primarily due to climate change,\u201d the report says. The report outlines the four criteria used to list the reef as a natural world heritage site in 1981. Components that underpin all four criteria have deteriorated, the report says. Under one criterion, covering how the ecosystem works, the report says: \u201cClimate change is having a detrimental impact on some critical regulating processes such as sea temperature, reef building and recruitment (the addition of new young to the population) which means the ability of the system to \u2018bounce back\u2019 is weakening.\u201d Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C is \u201cwidely cited as a critical threshold for the Reef,\u201d the report says. Australia is taking \u201cstrong action\u201d on climate change, the report maintains, saying a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 was a \u201csignificant contribution to global climate action\u201d. The head of oceans at WWF-Australia, Richard Leck, said: \u201cThis report confirms those natural values have been significantly damaged, and the world heritage committee needs to decide if they have been damaged enough that the [reef] is placed on the \u2018in danger\u2019 list. \u201cIt is welcome the Australian government is recognising that to protect the Great Barrier Reef, we need to limit global climate change to 1.5C. What\u2019s problematic is that Australia is not on track to achieve that and, in fact, there\u2019s a strong indication that if other countries did the same as Australia then we are more in line with a policy that would lead to a 3C or more rise in temperature.\u201d The director of strategy at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Imogen Zethoven, said the report\u2019s acceptance that the reef\u2019s outstanding universal value had been impacted was \u201ca critical statement for the World Heritage Committee to consider next year\u201d. She said the Australian government needed to play a leading role globally in encouraging leaders to act on climate change. \u201cThe report states that 1.5C is widely cited as a critical threshold for the reef, but it doesn\u2019t commit Australia to do our fair share of global emissions reduction to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.\u201d The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said in a statement that the Australian and Queensland governments had increased reef funding to \u201can unprecedented $2.7bn over the 10 years from 2014 to 2024\u201d. She said the government\u2019s Reef 2050 plan \u201cin conjunction with international emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement, are critical to the future of the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. Last month an international report said Australia\u2019s policy response on climate change was among the worst of all G20 countries. The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said the report to Unesco was \u201can exercise in spin\u201d. \u201cAn honest reef report would read \u2013 \u2018the reef is cooked unless we boldly and quickly ramp up rescue efforts\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
