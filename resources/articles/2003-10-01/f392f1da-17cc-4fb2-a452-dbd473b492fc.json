It's definitely one of the biggest games of my career and anyone who has ever walked out to face South Africa knows what to expect physically. You know what you're going to get before you get out there. Which is why, personally, I can't wait. I prefer coming off the field with a few scrapes and knocks, because then you know you've been at the heart of it, that you've done your job. If you come off with no mud on your shirt, no scratches, everything clean as a whistle, it's a case of \"Did I actually do anything out there today?\" I'm not starting the game but, even from the bench, South Africa are just one of those teams you enjoy playing against. They are renowned for their defence and playing the game hard. Fair enough. That's the way the game should be played. When you run at them they're going to do their best to smash you back 10 metres. People always ask \"What's it like playing the Springboks?\" but it's much the same as facing the French or the Argentinians. It's just in their nature to play the game hard. Every time you take the pitch against them you know that. All you can do is prepare yourselves to be more physical than them. There will be two very physical teams out there tomorrow and I honestly believe it's going to be a fantastic game. There is a distinct line, though, between physical and dirty. There was a lot happening during last November's game at Twickenham but I can't give you a blow-by-blow first-hand account of the rough stuff because I came off injured after barely 15 minutes. All I did was gather a kick-off (they all seemed to be coming to me for some reason) and run it back, only to get hit by two guys and land awkwardly on my shoulder. I watched the rest of the game from the stand where, without the aid of slow-motion replays, it was as hard for me to spot exactly who was doing what to whom as it was for the spectators. The truth, of course, is that lots of things go unnoticed in the dark, deep recesses of the rucks, although the increased number of camera angles has cleaned the game up significantly. I remember my early days playing for Leicester with Dean Richards and John Wells around 1996 when we'd go up to places like Orrell and it would be a free-for-all. You'd be at the bottom of a ruck and people would be poking you, stamping on you, anything they could get away with. I remember one occasion - it may well have been at Orrell - when I was lying on the ground and suddenly felt someone's mouth wrapping itself around my ear. It was that particular individual's way of saying: \"Don't do that again.\" I guess it was my initiation into the world of senior rugby. But times have changed, to some extent anyway. Whenever you get \"blindsided\" you remember it but during the heat of a game you ignore a lot, simply because your focus is on the game. I've only been cited once in my career, following a game against Leinster in the Heineken Cup when I was charged with stamping on Brian O'Driscoll's head (pretty much the rugby equivalent of kicking the Pope in public). All I'd done was go in and hit a ruck and, as I was clearing out with my boot, O'Driscoll rolled out. It was totally accidental and the case was thrown out. I can also say, hand on heart, that I've met loads of nice South Africans. Fritz van Heerden, Joel Stransky and Glenn Gelderbloom have all played with us at Leicester and I've enjoyed spending a lot of time with them all. Someone like Glenn sums up South African rugby: at 33 he's still as competitive as ever and some of the hits he puts in are phenomenal, twice as good as I'm capable of. You know how they've been brought up, you know the way they've been taught and defence is fundamental. Believe me, tomorrow's game will be physical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
