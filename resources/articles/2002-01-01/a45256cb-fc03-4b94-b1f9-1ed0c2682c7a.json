Dundee have expressed fears for the safety of their players after Wednesday's attack on Patrizio Billio outside Dens Park. Police are keen to talk to a shaven-haired man in his late 20s or early 30s who was in the area at the time.

Billio last played for the first team in November 2000, De Marchi in March 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
