Mr Chavez, speaking at a ceremony in a remote Indian village, Barranco Yopal, said the New Tribes Mission, based in Sanford, Florida, was no longer welcome. Presenting property titles to indigenous groups, he accused the missionaries of building luxurious camps next to impoverished villages and circumventing Venezuelan customs authorities as they freely flew in and out on private planes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
