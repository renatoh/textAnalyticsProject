Although such instances were rare, Sir James Munby said no one should ever be uprooted from their home and other family members against their will. The president of the high court\u2019s family division told the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services conference of his \u201cpersonal outrage\u201d at the \u201cinhumanity\u201d of putting older couples who had been together for decades into separate care homes. Most people would prefer to stay with their partner than live somewhere safer, Munby argued. Studies have found that a disproportionate number of people die shortly after being moved to a care home. The 68-year-old judge, who is due to retire next year, said: \u201cWe do know that people die of a broken heart. I have read of cases where one person died and then the other dies a couple of days later. How long do people last if they are uprooted? A very short time.\u201d About 300,000 elderly people in England and Wales live in care homes. Munby said social workers should resist the desire to \u201crescue\u201d the elderly from \u201csqualid\u201d dwellings that they nevertheless regarded as their home. \u201cMerely demonstrating that if you let that person go on living in that house there is a foreseeable and appreciable risk that one day a neighbour or carer will come in and find them with a broken neck at the bottom of the stairs \u2013 is that sufficient justification for making them leave, if it is going to make them thoroughly miserable?\u201d he told the conference. \u201cIt is no good just saying most people would prefer to live longer in nice new accommodation without breaking their neck \u2013 some people would not.\u201d Munby is behind a push to hold some family court hearings in public in England and Wales for the first time in a bid to make the system more transparent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
