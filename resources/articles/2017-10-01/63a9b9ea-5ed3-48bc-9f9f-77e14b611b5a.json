Here, singing in English, she brings trademark smoky, breathy vocals to an impeccable range of covers ranging from well-worn standards (Moon River, Stand By Your Man) to less predictable personal favourites (Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence). All are given the same treatment: beautiful but strangely detached French ennui and tasteful jazzy backings. She almost surgically removes the emotion from The Winner Takes It All and Love Letters, songs that demand real passion. Meanwhile, David Foster\u2019s arrangements veer from the flawlessly sophisticated to the downright inappropriate: Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day as a jaunty, zippy waltz? Thankfully, Bruni brings a hint of mischief to former beau Mick Jagger\u2019s Miss You and her sultry, playful take on AC/DC\u2019s Highway to Hell is so incongruous it works wonderfully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
