Typically, for a folk singer, she concludes the show with a singalong. Less typically, the singalong is in Chinese. \"This tune is in an ethnic dialect, but don't let that worry you,\" she says. \"If it helps, remember that xi is pronounced with an 'x''. The audience, mostly here to see headliner Ricky Skaggs, seems uncertain what to make of Washburn's strange amalgam of old-time Appalachian ballads, psychedelic folk-rock and ancient Chinese poetry. But Washburn, a fluent Mandarin speaker, learned the children's nonsense tune, Sala, when she travelled to Sichuan province to assist in the relief effort following the earthquake of 2008. \"I went to work in the relocation schools. To keep spirits up I sang American folk songs to the children, and they taught me theirs,\" she explains. \"There was one little girl who told me, 'My mother has gone, but this is the song she used to sing to comfort me. Please take it with you and share it with everyone.'\" The Illinois-born 31-year-old did not originally intend to become a musician. Having developed a fascination for China as a child, she became the first person to graduate from Colorado College with a major in east Asian studies and Mandarin. In 2003 she gained a place at Beijing University to study international law, and felt that \"as I was about to move to China for several years, I ought to take a little piece of America with me, to remind me where I came from. So I bought a banjo.\" Washburn took a gap year to undertake what she jokingly refers to as \"a farewell tour of America\". She carried the banjo with her and no sooner fingered her first chord than she found she had also written her first song. \"I went to a bluegrass convention in Kentucky and was plucking away at the three tunes I knew in a hotel lobby. A few people stopped to listen, and when I'd finished, one of them introduced himself as the head of a record company, and asked me to send a demo.\" She was still in two minds when she entered a recording studio for the first time. \"I didn't know if I wanted to embark on a career as a professional musician if it meant giving up my dream of practising law in China. I thought long and hard about it, but in the end the solution was simple \u2013 I could write bluegrass tunes in Mandarin.\" Her debut album, Song of the Travelling Daughter, was inspired by an eighth- century Chinese lyric, in which a mother unwinds the threads of a jumper she has knitted for her son, who has been lost at war. \"I'm no ethnomusicologist,\" Washburn says. \"There is a connection between the five-note scale used both in traditional Chinese music and the blues, but I don't really understand it. All I know is, whenever I play with Chinese musicians, we seem to belong to the same musical gene pool.\" Washburn's career accelerated when she received an offer to join the all-female bluegrass band Uncle Earl. The group enjoyed international success and attracted the attention of Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones \u2013 a bluegrass fan \u2013 who produced their album, Waterloo Tennessee. Washburn toured for five years with \"the g'Earls\", but chose to leave the band in 2008. \"Walking away from Uncle Earl was very hard, and I cried deeply over it. Yet the band had reached a level where I realised that if I gave it the level of commitment it demanded, there would no longer be any room for China in my life.\" Instead, Washburn formed the Sparrow Quartet, a chamber ensemble featuring the highly unusual combination of violin, cello and two banjos. The group's self-titled album was a semi-classical suite inspired by Washburn's impressions of the US and China: \"the intention was to produce a folk-based work that placed the emphasis on composition rather than improvisation \u2013 I wanted to see if it was possible to play traditional Chinese melodies with western strings and bluegrass instrumentation.\" The group performed as part of the cultural festival surrounding the Beijing Olympics, and became the first American ensemble to be invited to tour Tibet. It was also the first time that Washburn had collaborated artistically with her partner, banjo virtuoso B\u00e9la Fleck, whom she married last year. \"B\u00e9la had scheduled a year off, so he decided to spend it touring China with me. I said, you can't be in my band \u2013 you're far too famous! But we found a way of making it work.\" The Sparrow Quartet dissolved in 2009 when Fleck resumed his solo schedule and Washburn returned to China to produce Afterquake, an EP of \"deliberately cheesy Chinese electronica\" in which she sampled local children singing US folk songs to raise funds for Sichuan earthquake relief. But it was the discovery of a new instrument, and a new writing partner, that inspired a further change in direction. Last year Washburn acquired a cello banjo: a rare, low-pitched instrument originally manufactured in the early 20th century during the short-lived craze for banjo orchestras. Cello banjos became obsolete by the end of the 1920s when the banjo's popularity was supplanted by the guitar, yet Washburn's modern reproduction instrument makes its rumbling presence felt on her new release, City of Refuge, co-written with Nashville multi-instrumentalist Kai Welch. \"I first met Kai at a show in a clothing store in Nashville. He was running all over the stage picking up everything \u2013 trumpet, piano, accordion, guitar, and I thought: wow, he's interesting, I wonder if he'll make a record with me?\" The album was recorded in Portland, Oregon by producer Tucker Martine, who is best known for his work with the Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens and My Morning Jacket. \"I think Tucker thought, 'Oh, it's just a little banjo girl, it shouldn't be too difficult' \u2013 until I showed up with two dozen musicians, a huge cello banjo and a 15-piece choir.\" City of Refuge is a lavish record that turns the heat under Washburn's melting pot a further few notches. The title track grafts an Appalachian melody to a Blind Willie Johnson song, then adds a haunting string arrangement by Scottish fiddler Jeremy Kittel and a layer of backwards noise reminiscent of the Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows. It is the most personal of Washburn's albums to date, with some starkly autobiographical lyrics alluding to troubled teen years. \"I have no idea what people in traditional bluegrass circles will make of me working with people like Welch and Tucker Martine,\" Washburn says. \"But it's almost been like a meeting of the tribes.\" She holds up her palm in the manner of a Native Indian salute: \"Greetings, indie-rock guys. I come from the folk world, may our people live in peace.\" Two days after the show at BB King's, Washburn's new band (featuring Welch and former Uncle Earl fiddler Rayna Gellert) play an acoustic show at the album launch party. This is an intimate, spontaneous show in a neighbourhood bookstore, where the audience pick up the drift of Sala and pronounce their Chinese x's perfectly. Washburn seems ecstatic with the response, and launches into flat-footing (an Appalachian clog dance) executed in shiny golden pixie boots. She also debuts a recently written murder ballad, her delicate frame dwarfed by the surreal dimensions of the cello banjo. \"It's a cut that didn't make the album because the producer thought it was too morbid,\" she explains. \"But all the old-time tunes have a female victim. I thought 'How about writing a song which gives the girl a gun for a change?'\" Abigail Washburn appears at Celtic Connections, Glasgow, on 25 January and London Electroacoustic Club on 31 January. City of Refuge is released on Rounder records on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
