But he will head into this year\u2019s edition on Friday having suffered a series of setbacks before a single runner has even seen a starting stall. Magical, his obvious team leader, was ruled out a few days ago and Monday\u2019s draw was also unkind to many of his entries, leaving Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner, as possibly his best chance of a 13th Breeders\u2019 Cup winner this weekend. It is now well over three years since a Derby winner won a subsequent race, and Anthony Van Dyck has come up short in three starts since his narrow success at Epsom in early June. He has disappointed only once, however, when second-last in the King George at Ascot, and steady support for Anthony Van Dyck has forced his price down to 5-2 for the Turf on Saturday. \u201cHe only had one little blip and that was in bad ground in the King George and I shouldn\u2019t have run him,\u201d O\u2019Brien said here on Thursday. \u201cAll his other form is excellent and we\u2019ve been delighted with him since [the Derby]. He had a great run in the Irish Champion and we\u2019d have run in the Arc if the ground had been nice but it wasn\u2019t, so we stayed [at home] and did a piece of work at Dundalk. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it. The trip, ground, track, draw, everything looks right for him.\u201d Circus Maximus, the favourite for Saturday\u2019s Mile despite a wide draw in stall nine, is another big contender for Ballydoyle this weekend, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s team leader on Friday faces a huge task from the widest stall of all. Arizona, the runner-up to the brilliant Pinatubo in the Dewhurst Stakes last time, is the best horse in the Juvenile Turf by some distance on ratings but he is out in stall 12 in a race that is quickly on the turn on Santa Anita\u2019s tight turf course. \u201cObviously things have to fall a little bit more in your favour when you\u2019re out there,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s in very good form, we\u2019ve always thought that he\u2019d love fast ground and he\u2019s never had it until now, so that will help him.\u201d Friday\u2019s best bets The first British Group One race to be run on a synthetic track is the feature event of the domestic action on Friday and while the Vertem Futurity is only at Newcastle because last weekend\u2019s meeting at Doncaster was abandoned, it is a better and deeper race as a result. The Futurity-which-wasn\u2019t featured five juveniles from O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable up against one \u2013 Andrew Balding\u2019s Kameko \u2013 from somewhere else. The re-arranged race has twice as many runners, and a very interesting supplementary entry in Ralph Beckett\u2019s Kinross (6.00). He arrives at Newcastle with just one run to his name, but it was a deeply impressive win in a maiden that has already produced two subsequent winners and Kinross could prove to be something special. Divine Spirit (1.40) and Rainbow Dreamer (2.50) both have plenty to recommend them on the card at Newmarket while Battleofthesomme (12.55), who looked like a new horse when successful on his chasing debut at Southwell last time, should take advantage of his lower hurdling mark at Uttoxeter. Ardlethen (1.55) could give the top-class hurdler Sam Spinner something to think about in the novice chase at Wetherby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
