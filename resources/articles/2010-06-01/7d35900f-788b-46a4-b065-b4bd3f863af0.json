The point of the umbrella parade is that in a turbulent world, you never know who will need shelter. It cannot be said too often that the international convention on refugees evolved in response to the murderous mess that was Europe in the mid-20th century. During the past week it has again become clear just how grudgingly Britain fulfils its obligations to people in need of a safe haven. The Guardian revealed that \u00a34m is being invested in a \"reintegration centre\" in Kabul that will pave the way for the deportation of Afghan children. And it reported that Whitehall lawyers were warning high court judges not to disrupt or delay a plane especially chartered to return people to the war-torn heart of Iraq. Never mind that the UN high commissioner for refugees cautioned against these deportations. David Cameron's early words about taking refugees \"to our hearts\" conveyed an understanding that a civilised government must take a civilised stance towards asylum seekers \u2013 a contrast with his predecessor as Tory leader, Michael Howard, who proposed imposing an arbitrary cap, and leaving the persecuted to suffer the consequences. The infusion of Liberal Democrat thinking into the coalition agreement gave extra reason to be hopeful. But the promise to end the detention of child migrants sits uneasily with the return of minors to unstable Afghanistan, a move that looks deeply cynical, since Britain's case that return is generally in the child's own best interest comes attached to the self-serving argument that alternatives, such as guardianship, are too expensive. As for the coalition's promise to bar the removal of asylum seekers who live in fear of their home country's law owing to their sexuality, a great deal of work will be needed to translate warm general words into individual decisions. Practitioners claim 49 sexuality-based claims in every 50 are refused at the first hearing. People can be advised to go home and \"be discreet\" about their homosexuality, and that is only after they have seen off the breathtaking cases often made against them. Home Office officials will cheerfully cite an individual's failure to visit gay clubs or browse on gay websites as evidence that they may be straight. The Refugee Council and others are this week encouraging us all to perform simple acts to connect with refugees, and to open our ears to their voices. The system must do the same. As things stand, asylum seekers are too often made to feel as if they have left one country where they face persecution, only to arrive at another where they are presumed to be liars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
