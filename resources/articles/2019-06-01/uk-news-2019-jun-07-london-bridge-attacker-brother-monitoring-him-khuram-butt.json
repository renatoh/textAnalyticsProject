Khuram Butt and his two accomplices murdered eight people when they drove a van into pedestrians and then went on a stabbing spree on 3 June 2017. Giving evidence at the inquests for the eight victims, his eldest brother, Saad Butt, said he believed he could keep an eye on his brother because of his own experience in counter-extremism. Saad Butt told the Old Bailey in London on Friday that, as a member of an organisation called the Young Muslims Advisory Group, he was involved in the Prevent programme, had advised police officers and even represented the UK government on a trip to Pakistan. Asked why he did not report his brother after discovering that he was planning to take his family to Turkey, apparently to go across the border to Syria, he said: \u201cI felt capable in monitoring him, keeping in touch with him and going my best to make sure he\u2019s not going in that direction at all. I felt competent in doing that because of the background I have.\u201d Butt said he would meet his brother weekly for dinner with their families, alternating between their flats, and would challenge his views. He said in response his brother would be reflective and was unable to repudiate his arguments. Butt, a youth worker, initially claimed it was the right decision to monitor his brother himself. However, after he told the court his ability to do so was limited by the resources at his disposal, Jonathan Hough QC, the counsel to the inquests, asked him whether that did not illustrate why he should have called the anti-terrorism hotline. He replied: \u201cOn reflection \u2026 definitely yes, but at that time I thought I was doing the best I could \u2026 If anything, he [Khuram Butt] was having positive discussions with me around finding work.\u201d Butt said that when counter-terrorism police raided his younger brother\u2019s house in October 2016 as part of a fraud investigation he felt relieved that he was on the radar of the authorities. He cited this as a reason for not reporting his brother even after knowing he had expressed anti-western views, been barred from a mosque and shared an image of decapitated children on a WhatsApp group. Butt said he had reprimanded his brother but added: \u201cI felt reassured then \u2026 that the authorities were doing their bit in the background. There was not even an inkling to me that said: \u2018Add to that, Saad. Add to that, Saad.\u2019\u201d He described the failure to stop his brother as a \u201ccollective failure\u201d. He said: \u201cAfter that raid, was there anything I could add that would have added to that investigation? No.\u201d The court heard that he was present at a gathering at his younger brother\u2019s house in mid-May 2017, a day before Rachid Redouane bought the knives used in the attack. Butt recalled a shocking incident, in which \u201cone of those that was doing a barbecue stuck a skewer in the meat and said: \u2018This is how you gut a kuffar [non-believer].\u2019\u201d Weeping as he recalled realising his brother was involved in the attack, Butt described a dream he had had about him in mid-April. \u201cHe came in with a shaven face with a suicide belt on and his lips are blue and just as he\u2019s about to detonate, I hug him to save him and others,\u201d he told the court. Questioned as to why he thought his brother had carried out the atrocity, Butt answered: \u201cForeign policy,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were from the same womb but we were different brothers.\u201d He read a statement on behalf of his family, expressing their sorrow \u201cfrom the depths of our hearts\u201d about those killed and maimed or who had lost loved ones, who they said they thought of every day. \u201cIf I could turn back time I would \u2026 trade places with you even if it meant losing my own life,\u201d he said. Khuram Butt, 27, Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, killed Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada; Sebastien Belanger, 36, a chef; Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia; Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Miralles De Imperial, 39; James McMullan, 32, the only Briton, who was from Brent, north-west London; Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French waiter; Xavier Thomas, 45, a French national; and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national.
