The greatest darts performer of all time is in arguably the best form of his career and next faces Mervyn King, who defeated Barrie Bates 4\u20132 in the evening's other quarter-final. \"The Power\" averaged almost 109, dropping only three legs to the Dutchman who defeated him at last year's German championship. \"He's a good player, Co, and in some ways I felt a little sorry for him because I just didn't give him a chance,\" said the 13-time world champion, who passed the daylight hours of New Year's Day watching Girls Aloud and Carry On films. \"I rested up, did everything perfect, did everything as I should do and everything has come to plan, obviously,\" said Taylor. \"You put the hard work in, you put the dedication in, and you put the rest in and you know how to win a tournament, so I've done everything perfectly.\" Stompe's average of 89.58 was below his 93 for the tournament, but with Taylor dropping only two legs as he raced into a two-set lead, the former BDO player never had time to settle. \"That's the best anyone has ever played against me,\" said Stompe. \"You know what he's like.\" The Dutchman added that he was not disappointed to lose to a player who he fully expects to claim a 14th title, saying: \"It's Taylor's to lose, automatically, he should be the winner.\" Taylor moved up a gear in ominous style in the third set, his average topping 110 as he shredded \"The Matchstick\" 3\u20130 again, with an 87 checkout in the third leg achieved despite missing his first attempt at double 18. Stompe, a tall and lean gentleman at the oche, took a very long drink of water when that dart hit the hemp. Taylor's average did not slip below 110 as he took the fourth set 4\u20130. A checkout average of 50% allied to his staggering scoring made a whitewash inevitable, though Stompe earned himself a standing ovation from the north London crowd when he took the third leg of the fifth set. In the earlier quarter-final the world No12, King, saw off the Welshman Bates, 5\u20132. The 29th seed, playing in his first-ever nine-set match, danced on to the stage holding two inflatable national emblems, a leek and a daffodil. His inflated joviality belied the broken foot he was carrying but his nerves became apparent in the first two sets, which King won easily. Bates rallied to take the next two sets but King reeled off the last three to set up tomorrow's semi-final with \"The Power\". The Norfolk man promptly threw down the gauntlet, saying: \"I want Taylor because I owe him, and I know I have the game to beat him and I want to beat him on TV.\" Taylor's retort: \"There's only one King at Alexandra Palace and that's me.\" It is hard to argue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
