The competition watchdog had intended to finish its analysis of the possible bids by the German exchange Deutsche B\u00f6rse and Euronext, the Dutch-French combine, by September 12. However, it is now understood that a final ruling will not be made until early November. Deutsche B\u00f6rse first revealed its interest in December last year. However, it is now thought unlikely to bid because of opposition to the deal from its shareholders, while the Australian bank Macquarie said on Monday that it was considering a bid for the LSE."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
