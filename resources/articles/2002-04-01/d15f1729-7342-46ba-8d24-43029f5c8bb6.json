The same goes for all the Wakefield lads, and I gave them Saturday off so they could have a good look at Wigan - this Wednesday we've got the new cup winners coming down to Belle Vue in a Super League match. I know some people are saying they will still be hung over, and I've no doubt they had a good night in Edinburgh on Saturday. But I think the whole Wigan organisation is a bit too professional for that. The problem for us is they'll probably call up a few of the young lads from their Academy team who helped to thrash Warrington 58-4 the other week. That shows the huge gulf that exists between Wigan and St Helens at one end of the Super League, and clubs like us at the other. Whereas their under-19s are all full-time, only four of ours are, and it's a bit early for them to be playing in the top grade. We still had to throw them in against Bradford the other week, and one of the teenage kids, Matty Wray, did superbly in our cup quarter-final against Leeds - even though he looked more like a street urchin than a Super League player. But that situation wasn't ideal, and that's why I've managed to bring in Andrew Frew from Australia, who will hopefully play on Wednesday. I was pleased for Wigan's coach, Stuart Raper, because all of us are under pressure. I gave up a steady job in bailiffing to go full-time with Wakefield this season. If I was to be sacked tomorrow and there was no financial compensation, apart from the small savings I have in the bank, I'd be knackered. Still, I wouldn't change it. To actually do something you enjoy and get paid for it - there's not many people in life can say they have that opportunity. The hardest thing is getting in from Keighley every morning with the traffic. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
