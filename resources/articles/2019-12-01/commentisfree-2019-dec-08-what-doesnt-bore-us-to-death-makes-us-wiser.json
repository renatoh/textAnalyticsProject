Do you think: \u201cOoh, interesting! I wonder what those guys have got to say!\u201d? If so, I reckon you\u2019re unusual. My reaction is closer to Homer Simpson\u2019s when The Boring World of Niels Bohr comes on TV. I become almost frightened at the prospect of the forthcoming guilt-infused stultification. The name is remarkably unremarkable. Never have two nouns and an adjective run each other so close in a competition to be least interesting. It\u2019s hard to think of any replacement for \u201cInstitute\u201d, \u201cFiscal\u201d or \u201cStudies\u201d that wouldn\u2019t slightly jazz up the organisation\u2019s image. I\u2019d give honourable mention to strong contenders such as \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cChartered\u201d, \u201cCommittee\u201d and \u201cActuarial\u201d, but I really don\u2019t think they could make it sound any more dull. The most interesting word in its name is \u201cfor\u201d. All of which made me suspect the blandness to be some sort of cover and that it\u2019s actually incredibly right- or leftwing, or extremist-Christian, or madly Islamophobic, or anti-MMR, or totally obsessed with astrology. Maybe I\u2019m thinking of the Institute of Economic Affairs, which both wants to privatise the NHS and has received money from tobacco giants (so it\u2019s keen to monetise both ends of the coughing process). But those guys have made the schoolboy error of putting the word \u201caffairs\u201d in the name, which catches the tedium-weary eye like a Timmy Mallett jacket that got mixed up with John Major\u2019s dry-cleaning. Assuming the hope was to sound uninteresting and respectable to draw attention away from all the malevolent lobbying, its name selection represents a serious market failure. But it turns out that the Institute for Fiscal Studies is not the featureless tarmac that conceals a Bond villain\u2019s underground poisoned-chocolate factory. It describes its aim as to \u201cadvance education for the benefit of the public by promoting on a nonpolitical basis the study and discussion of and the exchange and dissemination of information and knowledge concerning national economic\u2026\u201d Wake up! Come on, this is important! So it seems that it\u2019s important \u2013 though not malicious or secretive \u2013 and says important things about important things, and it\u2019s probably important that we should take notice of them. Which means there are three options: feel bored by all the boring important things; feel guilty for ignoring the boring important things; or (my preferred option) a bit of both. Now, you may say that you don\u2019t actually find the prospect of a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies remotely tedious on any level \u2013 but, if so, that\u2019s because you are lying, possibly even to yourself. You may also be uncomfortable with the concept of something important ever being boring; in general, that\u2019s taboo in our society. We pretend that important things can\u2019t be dull \u2013 and that bored schoolchildren are the fault of lazy teachers rather than the whole dreary nature of reality \u2013 in the same way that we pretend nasty things can\u2019t be cool. Well, it\u2019s got to stop. If we\u2019re ever going to get post post-truth, we have to sling out all that bullshit. Smoking is cool and carcinogenic \u2013 as the Institute of Economic Affairs probably wouldn\u2019t say. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies might if we could just keep our eyes open long enough to hear it. Not that we hear with our eyes. I don\u2019t think. Though somebody once told me that taste is mainly smell, so maybe hearing is mainly sight. I could look it up if I were interested enough, but I\u2019m not, which is certainly not the same as saying it\u2019s unimportant. Do you know what\u2019s sometimes cool? Dying young! Cf Lennon vs McCartney. Doesn\u2019t make it good, though. Cool is not a synonym for good and neither is interesting for important. And what the Institute for Fiscal Studies says about the election is important. So here we go: maybe try splashing some cold water on your face or running on the spot as you read. It says that neither Labour nor the Tories are offering credible spending plans in their manifestos. Terrific. That was no help. We\u2019ve all stayed awake for no reason (as the nation will be saying at 5am on 13 December). What are we supposed to conclude from that other than that the Lib Dems are even stupider than we thought? Their manifesto came out of the analysis as comparatively realistic. Talk about bringing a knife to a gunfight. As if the electoral system didn\u2019t disadvantage them enough, they\u2019re putting costed spending proposals up against alluring fictions. If they\u2019re going to win this, they\u2019ll have to rely very heavily on Jo Swinson\u2019s charisma. Obviously they\u2019re not going to win this. It\u2019s fortunate for us that the Lib Dems are fighting such a lacklustre campaign because we can tell ourselves that\u2019s why they\u2019re failing, rather than the less palatable truth that we are now a people that lack the attention span for their boring policies. The middle ground: the slightly more, but not dramatically more, redistributive taxation, proportional representation, 80% renewable energy by 2030, more teachers. Seriously, more teachers?! That\u2019s what they\u2019re going with! Just because that would be sensible? Get with the programme, guys: it\u2019s more police and more nurses that people want to hear about! Public servants who rough people up and public servants who then patch them up. Teachers? No one gives a shit! Reform through moderation and compromise is extremely unfashionable and despised by both Labour and the Tories, to the extent that the Lib Dems have been reduced to attempting to counterfeit the vacuous clarity of the political poles: they won\u2019t do a deal with either Johnson or Corbyn (when, in reality, their best hope would be to get a chance to), they\u2019d cancel Brexit without a second referendum, even though that smacks of democratic betrayal. Those are misjudgments in my view, but that\u2019s not why they\u2019ll get nowhere. They\u2019d get nowhere whatever they did. They\u2019ve got as much chance as the opposition to Putin. If we don\u2019t accept that important things can be boring, it means we think boring things can\u2019t be important. So we mistake the eye-catching for the insightful, the passionate for the wise. Mistaking clarity for righteousness, we ignore the Institute for Fiscal Studies because we\u2019re sick of experts. Charlatans make the simplistic and extreme seem morally superior to the thoughtful and complicated.
