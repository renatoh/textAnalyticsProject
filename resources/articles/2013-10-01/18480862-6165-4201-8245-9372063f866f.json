And where's the boss?", "bodyText": "\u2022 Turbulent times in health, with Jeremy Hunt soon to publish the government's final response to the Francis report on the Mid Staffs scandal. As storm clouds loom, staff at the General Medical Council are scratching their heads at the absence of their chief executive, Niall Dickson. He's on a visit to Australia and New Zealand. This worries worker bees at the GMC, for there's no doubt that the council sits in the minister's line of sight. While the Nursing and Midwifery Council has struck off nurses as a result of the Francis findings, the GMC declared it lacked evidence to do anything about the doctors involved. And Jeremy Hunt, not one to ignore a chance for some doctor bashing, is on the case. It promises to be a bruising experience for everyone. Probably seems less daunting from the other side of the world. \u2022 A trying period for justice secretary Chris \"Flailing\" Grayling. We know from previous accounts that he likes to close his in-tray at noon. But every day there is more irksome stuff to deal with. Take his grand plan to revolutionise the probation service, an arrangement that would see private companies filling their corporate boots, as they have in so many areas of government life. The expectation was that only 25% of the caseload would be categorised high risk and retained in-house, allowing contractors to cash in on the rest. But now it seems likely that up to 45% may have to stay in-house, making the proposition less profitable to the private sector. Curses and double curses. In August, Grayling and justice minister Jeremy Wright trumpeted a reorganisation by unveiling two people to lead the new National Probation Service. Mike Maiden to lead the probation service in England, Sarah Payne in Wales. \"The appointments mark a crucial step forwards in the delivery of our wide-ranging reforms,\" a spokesperson said, hailing them as just the right folk with invaluable operational frontline experience. This week, all change: after just two months and six months before assuming full responsibility, Mike Maiden stepped down for \"personal family reasons\". Best-laid plans go wrong. Grayling's hardly stand a chance. \u2022 Quite a kerfuffle about the UK Border Agency and its erroneous text messages ordering blameless British citizens to leave the country. The Home Office puts the blame on contractor Capita \u2013 but it bears responsibility. And there are many repercussions, as Home Office officials are finding out. Some recipients immediately realise a mistake has been made, but what about those who thought they had regularised their status and take the texts to mean there has been a rethink? What of those who relied on relatives or partners to guide them through the complicated process and now worry that their lives are unravelling? What about those who have incurred legal expenses? Well, that's the joy of a contract relationship, because today we learn that the Home Office is bracing itself for compensation claims. Officials confirm that those affected can seek recompense. But they would, wouldn't they? Bet Capita, not Theresa May, will pick up that bill. \u2022 Money is at the heart of this, of course. How much, asked the Central London Community Law Centre via FoI, is Capita paid by the Home Office to send deportation texts to those who should and shouldn't receive them? Not telling, says the Home Office. \"After careful consideration, we have decided that this information is exempt from disclosure.\" Quelle surprise. \u2022 We end on the theme of forgiveness. For politics is not a very forgiving business, particularly in the higher reaches of the Labour party. But if people are aggrieved at the intervention by Lord Mandelson, decrying Ed Miliband's conference speech as a threat to New Labour's legacy, they don't seem to be showing it. There he was this week at upmarket Simpson's in central London, dining with the yin to Miliband's yang, Ed Balls. All seemed very friendly. Maybe Mandy was telling Balls to send a message to the leader. Perhaps Balls was requesting from Mandy a period of silence. No proof that such a thing is possible, but what is politics if not the manifestation of hope? Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
