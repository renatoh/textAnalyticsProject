Toondah harbour is listed by the Queensland government as a \u201cpriority development area\u201d, a state-significant site identified for accelerated development. It also sits on tidal flats that are considered internationally significant and home to endangered migratory shorebirds. Opponents say the plan is one of the most brazen examples of urban development sprawling on to a sensitive environmental site. It is also legally complex, requiring approval by both the federal and Queensland governments. Walker Corporation, a significant donor to both major political parties, last week lodged a revised plan for Toondah harbour, the third in three years. The first was delayed seven times while under environmental consideration by the federal government. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The plan includes a new port facility, room for more than 6,000 residents, a hotel and convention centre, and a 1,000-space carpark. In a letter given to nearby residents this month, Walker Corporation says the new plan was developed \u201cin response to feedback from leading environmental and wetland experts, public submissions and the federal government\u201d. It says improvements include a larger buffer zone to nearby Cassim Island, \u201ca more organic and natural system of waterways\u201d, a section of parkland, a conservation area, a koala corridor and a wetland education centre. Opponents say no alterations to the plan could compensate for their principal objection: that creating an artificial harbour and high-rise development would require the dredging and destruction of sensitive wetlands. Richard Carew, a lawyer and member of the group Friends of Stradbroke Island, said the plan, even with modifications, breached Australia\u2019s obligations under the Ramsar convention, an international treaty for the protection of wetlands. \u201cReclamation of wetlands listed under the agreement is only permitted if \u2018urgent national interests\u2019 exist,\u201d Carew said. \u201cOur national environment protection laws adopt the agreement by specifically requiring the federal government to act consistently with it.\u201d The proposal requires the approval of the federal environment minister. But the development plans themselves fall under state law and a fast-track for major proposals introduced by the Newman government and maintained by the current Palaszczuk government. Jo-Ann Bragg, the chief executive officer of the Environmental Defender\u2019s Office Queensland, said the state laws did not allow for appeal once a decision had been made. \u201cEDO Queensland have had calls from a wide variety of deeply concerned citizens and community groups who are really most unhappy that this sort of development is proposed with impacts on ... a very sensitive location,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cBy and large the natural environment is not solidly protected through our planning and development system. There\u2019s constant inroads into our natural environment and loss of habitat. In relation to koala habitat, we\u2019re at a crisis point. \u201cWith Toondah harbour we need a different process here and the [state] government has the legal power to change that process. And really this is a touchstone of how serious the government is about protecting high value sensitive nature.\u201d Peter Saba, the general manager of Queensland development for Walker Corporation, said the organisation had worked with a wetland expert to develop the masterplan. \u201cWhat has been submitted is a world-class design which enhances the environment whilst providing the Redland community with a fabulous destination,\u201d he said. \u201cThe master plan is defined by a more organic and natural system of waterways and marina coves embedded with wetlands and publicly accessible edges. \u201cWe have put a lot of work into ensuring we have a plan that suits the area and the community who will get to enjoy it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
