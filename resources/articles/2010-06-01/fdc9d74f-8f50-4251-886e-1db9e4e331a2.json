Thomas took three wickets for the sixth successive match \u2013 giving the unsung South African seamer 22 for the year at a remarkable average of 10.09 \u2013 as Glamorgan were dismissed for 138 at Taunton. Somerset then knocked off those runs with eight balls to spare to seal a six-wicket win, although it was not looking that comfortable until Pollard smashed Chris Ashling for three consecutive sixes in the 15th over. James Hildreth (45) and Nick Compton (40) had earlier shared a second\u2011wicket stand of 83. The win lifted Somerset to third in the South Group, four points behind the leaders Sussex with two games in hand. Glamorgan, whose burly Australian opener Mark Cosgrove hit 75 from 54 balls, remain sixth, a further four points behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
