His shoulder-length ginger hair might be scraped into a ponytail, he will be bobbing his head, and it is certain that his hands will be flying over the keys, constantly injecting new ideas into the mix. This is Joe Armon-Jones. Founding member of the group Ezra Collective, as well as a longtime collaborator of saxophonist Nubya Garcia and producer Maxwell Owin, Armon-Jones, 26, has his fingers in many pies. His style is unmistakable though \u2013 an endless capacity for finding skewed ways in and out of phrases, much like Herbie Hancock, and an ingrained sense of rhythm. Armon-Jones\u2019s debut album, 2018\u2019s Starting Today, established him as a deft arranger, combining reggae dubs with p-funk, and his latest release, Icy Roads (Stacked), is just as imaginative. Opening with a dreamy set of chords, it builds to a euphoric synth-laden climax, backed by the rocksteady grooves of drummer Kwake Bass. Whether it\u2019s his jazz, hip-hop or production work, Armon-Jones\u2019s music grabs your attention. Expect to see him on a stage near you soon. Icy Roads (Stacked) is out now on Brownswood Recordings. Joe Armon-Jones plays the We Out Here festival, Cambridgeshire on 15 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
