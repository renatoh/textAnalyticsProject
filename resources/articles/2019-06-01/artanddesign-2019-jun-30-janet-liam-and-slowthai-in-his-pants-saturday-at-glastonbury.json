From Janet Jackson\u2019s Pyramid stage set to impromptu dips, here are the best photos from Saturday: Janet Jackson ruling the Pyramid stage. Liam Gallagher invites the BBC\u2019s cameras to come and \u2018ave a go. Resplendent in boxers: Slowthai performing on West Holts. Out here getting juice: Lizzo on West Holts. Photos: Neil Hall/EPA, Leon Neil/Getty, Henry Nicholls/Reuters, Absolutely nothing troubling whatsoever about this Lewis Capaldi fan\u2019s demonstration of their ardour. And, Anne-Marie summing up the scale of her Pyramid stage set. Freaky dancing during the Chemical Brothers\u2019 Other stage show. An envoy group from Glastonbury-on-Sea, perhaps. A sleek Skye Edwards of Morcheeba. Shelter was at a premium during the fierce Saturday afternoon heatwave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
