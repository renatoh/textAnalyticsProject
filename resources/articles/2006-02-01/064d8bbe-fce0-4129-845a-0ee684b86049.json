Manchester Evening News' publisher, Guardian Media Group, which also operates MediaGuardian.co.uk, today told staff it would cut 35 posts, including eight clerical staff and 27 journalists. Staff have been given one week to request voluntary redundancies. The paper is to merge its features subeditors and news subeditors and will call on editorial staff to work more flexible hours across mornings, afternoons, evenings and weekends. Management said it planned, in future, to use casual staff and picture agencies to supply photos and would cut its photographic staff of six. The GMG regional chief executive, Mark Dodson, said the Manchester Evening News faced \"one of the most challenging periods in its history\". \"There has been an economic and structural shift in its income streams and the business has to fundamentally change if it is to thrive in a digital future,\" he said. \"The changes that we propose unfortunately involve a number of job losses. We understand that this is a difficult time for our colleagues but we will work closely with the staff and their representatives to make sure that the process is as straightforward as possible.\" He stressed that the job losses were confined to the regional newspaper division. GMG management announced the cuts after commissioning a review conducted by management consultants Collinson Grant. The National Union of Journalists said it would ballot its members for strike action if management tried to implement compulsory redundancies. \"We don't see any need for these redundancies,\" said a spokeswoman. \"Rather than making this extraordinary draconian cutbacks, they should be investing more.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
