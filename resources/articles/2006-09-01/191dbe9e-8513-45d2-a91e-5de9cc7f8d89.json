Gordon Strachan, the losing manager, refused to blame the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel for the highly dubious penalty he awarded to Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson was at pains to praise the Scottish champions for their contribution. \"You have to give Celtic great credit,\" said Ferguson. \"We have a lot of teams who come here, put a bank of five across midfield and sit everyone on the edge of their own box. Not Celtic, though. They came here with a positive nature and had a real go. It's typical of their football club. \"We played Lille here last season and for the last 40 minutes we had 10 men yet they still didn't have one bloody shot at goal. It depressed me, that. They were happy playing for 0-0 with 10 men behind the ball and it was pathetic. Celtic? They showed the way football should be played. It wasn't the cat-and-mouse stuff you normally get in Europe at all.\" Ferguson eulogised about the Celtic supporters and he could not resist taking a swipe at the people Roy Keane had infamously labelled as the prawn-sandwich brigade. \"Sometimes on a Saturday the supporters come here and they're half-asleep, waiting to be entertained,\" he said. \"Tonight was totally different. The spirit of the game was great and the Celtic fans really played their part. I wish that everyone we faced brought 6,000 supporters with them because it created a really competitive element between the two sets of fans.\" The United manager felt his side had deserved to win and he singled out their penetrative players, describing Paul Scholes as \"phenomenal\". In one night United scored more goals than they managed in six matches during their last Champions League campaign and Ferguson identified the goalscorers Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for special acclaim. \"Credit to Celtic but, to sum up the game, we could have scored 10,\" he said. \"Louis could have beaten the all-time European scoring record. He's got everything and he will score a lot of goals for us this season if he stays fit. As for Ole, it's just great to see him scoring again. He's a natural goalscorer. He seems to know where the ball is going to land inside the penalty area even before it does.\" Strachan disputed Ferguson's version of events, arguing that his team had done enough to justify a draw. \"Our problem is going to be waking up in the morning and living with the regret. That's a horrible thing in football. In the morning the players will get up and the first thing they will think is 'if only'. But they can hold their heads up high. \"The mistakes they made were honest ones and they have nothing to be embarrassed of. I thought our so-called ordinary players - the back four - were fantastic and everyone worked as a team. Our flair players did not pass the ball as well as they could. I'm really pleased with the team's attitude but it's draining not to have got anything for it.\" Asked about Michel's penalty decision, which led to United's first goal, he said: \"It was a mistake but we have to get on with it. I'm not slamming. I'm not blasting, but it was not a penalty. The referee made one mistake all night whereas we made a number, so why criticise someone for one? It's not going to change anything.\" Double blow for United Manchester United expect to lose Ryan Giggs for three weeks after the winger injured his hamstring in last night's win over Celtic. It was the second setback of the day for Sir Alex Ferguson, who had earlier revealed Park Ji-sung will be out for three months after tearing ligaments in his left ankle. The South Korea midfielder, who was hurt in the 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, will have surgery today. Giggs hobbled off in the first half after being brought down in the penalty area by Artur Boruc. The goalkeeper was booked and Louis Saha converted the spot-kick for United's opening goal. Ferguson, however, must now reshuffle his midfield before Arsenal's league visit to Old Trafford on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
