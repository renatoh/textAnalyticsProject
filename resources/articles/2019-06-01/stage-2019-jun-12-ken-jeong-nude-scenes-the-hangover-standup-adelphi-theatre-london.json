That\u2019s whether he\u2019s springing naked from the boot of a car in The Hangover and landing crotch-first on Bradley Cooper\u2019s mouth like the face-hugger in Alien. Or stalking the stage at the start of his new Netflix special, making slow-motion masturbatory hand gestures, his fingers miming the spray of ejaculate in his fans\u2019 faces. Far from being offended, the crowd squeals delightedly, recognising it as the trademark of Mr Chow, the camp, motormouthed gangster played by Jeong in all three Hangover movies, which cemented his move from physician to jobbing comic to film phenomenon and ensured that, should he so choose, he could leave behind the standup circuit for ever. And yet here he is, back on the road again after a decade of film and television success, and heading to London for his first UK date a few weeks shy of his 50th birthday. \u201cI never, ever want to quit standup,\u201d he tells me from his home in Los Angeles, his default tone one of grave and emphatic humility. \u201cStandup has become a deeply personal journey for me, and I\u2019m very grateful to have the career I do.\u201d If that sounds like an implausibly strait-laced response from the man who named his Netflix show You Complete Me, Ho, it\u2019s important to know that the last word in that title is not a misogynistic epithet but a reference to his wife, Tran Ho. It is her experience of breast cancer \u2013 she has been cancer-free now for 11 years \u2013 that lends weight to a set that would otherwise be dominated by callbacks to Jeong\u2019s movies, shout-outs to famous chums (there\u2019s a meeting-Obama anecdote) and war stories from his medical days. Twelve years ago, he stole several scenes as a volatile doctor in Judd Apatow\u2019s Knocked Up before going on to play assorted uptight child-men, including the taunting, short-fused Spanish teacher Se\u00f1or Chang in six seasons of the smart-aleck sitcom Community, and a petty tyrant who dresses as a medieval king in Role Models. He had a cameo in the romcom Crazy Rich Asians and created his own autobiographical sitcom Dr Ken. When that was cancelled in 2017 after two seasons, he found himself itching to return to his comedy roots. \u201cI missed writing and creating stuff. Through doing Dr Ken I learned to write personally \u2013 we\u2019d even done an episode inspired by Tran\u2019s cancer \u2013 and I wanted to bring that into my standup.\u201d Something else has changed, too. Compare Jeong\u2019s performing style and material from 20 or even 10 years ago (much of it is still accessible on YouTube) and there is a marked softening of tone. It may partly be that we now know him better: it\u2019s hard to feel intimidated by someone who has not only flailed around naked on screen but also seizes every opportunity to draw attention to his own supposed shortcomings. It was his wife, after all, who predicted that The Hangover would be a feelgood hit because the most insecure male viewer would consider himself well-endowed compared with her husband. But it\u2019s more than that. Jeong\u2019s jabbing delivery has lost some of its off-putting aggression, and his language now is more considered. \u201cWhen I started I had 15 strong minutes. I was on the bill with Adam Sandler at the Improv, and when you\u2019re opening you have to fight to survive.\u201d Two decades ago, he compared and contrasted various Asian accents, describing the more elaborate Vietnamese delivery as \u201ckinda faggy\u201d. The rudiments of that routine have endured into the Netflix special but without the homophobia; now he says that the Vietnamese sound like \u201cKoreans on weed\u201d. (Jeong was raised in North Carolina by Korean parents, and refers to Koreans as \u201cthe hottest-tempered of all Asians\u201d.) In another early joke, he recalled being inundated as a doctor with hypochondriacs who were convinced they had cancer. His remedy, he used to say, was to prescribe chemotherapy for all. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he shudders when I ask if he would include that gag today. \u201cNever ever. My wife and I have talked about that. You evolve as you go along. And comedians, like all people, should be allowed to do that. In the days of social media, that\u2019s all changed. But I believe we should be given space to evolve our viewpoints and our philosophies. As triumph and tragedy strike us, we do change. I certainly have.\u201d One significant alteration in his life has been material, as he reminds his audience at regular intervals. \u201cI live in Los Angeles \u2013 the rich part,\u201d he boasts, while another joke begins: \u201cEven if I wasn\u2019t rich and famous, which I am \u2026\u201d He hoots when I point out this tendency. \u201cOh my God, I love doing that! I\u2019m not that rich really. I\u2019ve done it sometimes when I\u2019ve performed with much wealthier comics \u2013 Ray Romano or Chris Rock \u2013 and it tickles me no end. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll lean on that in London if a couple of jokes don\u2019t go so well. I\u2019ll just say, \u2018It\u2019s OK, I could buy this whole theatre \u2026\u2019\u201d \u2022 Ken Jeong is at the Adelphi theatre, London, on 23 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
