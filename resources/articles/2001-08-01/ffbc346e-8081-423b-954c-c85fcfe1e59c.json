Lane Clark &amp; Peacock said that under the new accounting standard, known as FRS 17, BT's reported pension costs of \u00a3167m a year would more than triple to reach a \u00a3620m charge against profits, because the new regime will force companies to value future liabilities at today's market prices. FRS 17 replaces the current standard, SSAP 24, and is being phased in between now and 2003. The actuaries said Boots would also be affected, claiming the new rule would have reduced its operating profit last year by \u00a365m. But the two companies dismissed the report, saying they would not expect FRS 17 to al ter market sentiment because the rules apply to every company. A Boots spokesman added: \"People understand that the fundamentals have not changed.\" Lane Clark &amp; Peacock said in its report that companies' operating profits would be hit hard by FRS 17 because of the need for them to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities much more explicitly in their annual accounts. A sufficiently large FRS 17 deficit could lead to an otherwise profitable company being unable to distribute a dividend, and the new rules might also accelerate the shift away from costly final salary occupational pension schemes to money purchase arrangements, which pass the burden of market volatility on to employees, it added. In addition, they could \"put employers off\" using pension surpluses to fund voluntary early retirement packages and other benefit improvements. \"Companies don't appreciate that their profits are going to be impacted on. At the moment it is some bad news in the distance,\" said a spokesman for the consulting actuaries. The report also found that, even before the arrival of the new rules, growing numbers of companies were closing their final salary pension schemes to new staff and insisting they pay into money purchase schemes. Of the 94 FTSE 100 companies that are UK-based, 11 say that new employees can only join a money purchase arrangement - up from seven last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
