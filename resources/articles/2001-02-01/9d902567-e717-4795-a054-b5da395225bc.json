There he made his great promise to the poor: \"No forgotten people and no no-hope areas.\" He staked his success on leaving behind \"a fairer country\". Is it? The distribution of income, let alone wealth, is probably no more equitable; if anything the gap between top and bottom has widened. But the poorest households have benefited disproportion ately from the government's changes in taxes and social benefits, as the chart shows. Labour's inheritance was certainly grim. While Labour was out of office 8m more people became poor on official definitions. While average incomes rose by 40%, those of the poorest stayed static. A third of all UK children were born into poverty. To plumb the depths, Labour commissioned a domesday book of poverty, measuring every ward in England for a mighty index of deprivation - this will become a benchmark for all successive administrations. Ministers certainly tried. Though poverty was not something Labour talked about much in public, from the start battalions of hyper-active ministers set about attacking urban conditions with myriad programmes. Employment, education and health action zones were given extra money, criss-crossing one another until researchers found there were no control zones where nothing was happening against which to judge their success. The social exclusion unit set up at the very heart of Whitehall pumped out projects with stiff targets for halving teenage pregnancy, school exclusion, truancy and rough sleepers, aimed at cutting off the paths into poverty. Initiatives flowed out, each allocated lump sums: the media soon lost count and then lost interest. If this government is not primarily identified with abolishing poverty, it is mainly its own fault for sending out such mixed messages. The cut in lone parent benefits demanded by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, early in the government's life was followed by an equally politically misleading cut in disability benefits. The sums were trifling, but the cabinet wanted to be seen to be \"reforming\" social security. Yet despite Tory rhetoric, the social security bill was not some huge drain on resources, at just 13% of GDP compared with an average of 19% across the European Union. Plummeting unemployment saw the bill fall slightly from \u00a3100bn to \u00a399bn. It would have fallen further but for large increases willed by Labour: in income support (up a real 72% for children), child benefit (up 25%) and pensions (up 30% for the poorest). Greatly increased in-work benefits would have seen the total bill for social supports rise further but these were hidden away in the accounts of the Inland Revenue, re-badged as tax credits. Their effects were real enough: working families tax credit brought an average \u00a324 a week extra to low-paid families, child tax credits brought a further \u00a3520 a year. Labour's \u00a35bn windfall tax on the privatised utilities financed far more than the New Deal, aimed initially at 250,000 unemployed under-25s. Independent studies say many young people would have found work anyway, but 160,000 got into jobs at least six months sooner than they would have done without the programme. The New Deal for over-25s doubled the number into jobs at a very reasonable cost of \u00a34,000 each. New Deals for lone par ents, the over-50s and disabled people followed. Destiny starts at birth, Labour said. Before they are two years old, children from the top social classes are already 14% ahead of the bottom classes in terms of development. The first generation born under Labour's programmes ought to break that cycle of deprivation. Sure Start (costing \u00a3580m) is designed to catch depressed mothers and failing families in the poorest areas with support at home and in nurseries. American research showed how intensive help for two nursery years saved seven times the sums spent later on social security and crime for those children. During the past four years, all four-year-olds were given nursery places, with three-year-olds to follow. The national childcare strategy promises 1m after-school, homework and holiday schemes. Connexions, for 11-25-year-olds, offers a further safety net. But Connexions gets going in earnest only this year. Back on the Aylesbury estate, just one of 2,000 worst estates, how much change have residents yet seen? Policy no longer forgets them. More money has arrived through the various zones. Crime is down, though few realise it. The local primary school has had excellent results recently. Pensioners and families have more money in their household budgets, more people have jobs. The New Deal for communities has given the estate \u00a356m - but, as elsewhere, the money sits in the bank while a local committee makes plans. It all takes time and it all started two years too late. Few residents claim signs of improvement yet. The air is thick with promises, delivery yet to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
