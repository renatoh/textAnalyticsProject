At question time, Mr Cook said there was no \"settled will\" for change at the present time. He also suggested it would require major alterations to the Commons chamber to enable MPs to sit in their own seats and vote electronically. At present MPs do not have their own seats and the chamber is not big enough to seat every one of the 659 members. The issue has arisen as part of Mr Cook's flagship modernisation plans. Votes are currently counted manually in the lobbies and each division can take up to 15 minutes. Mr Cook said a survey in the last parliament produced no majority for change. MPs valued the contact with ministers and colleagues during the votes, as they filed through the division lobbies. Tory John Bercow welcomed his comments, warning that a change to electronic voting would be costly and could possibly involve fingerprinting to prevent abuse. But Labour's David Kidney said Mr cook was wrong, adding: \"If there were sufficient seats, there could be sufficient buttons for each member to press. \"We could save something like 14 minutes per vote, adding considerable amounts of debate to our scrutiny of legislation.\" Mr Cook told him: \"It would alter the character of this chamber for all time. It would have to be a much larger chamber. \"If we were to vote by sitting in our seats here, there would be less free milling around and contact that comes at present in the division lobbies, which I know is immensely valued by members - possibly not always equally valued by ministers who are exposed to lobbying. But nevertheless it is an important point for parliament to come together.\" Deputy shadow leader of the House, Greg Knight, welcomed Mr Cook's \"robust\" stance. Electronic voting could only be introduced \"if we demolished this chamber or substantially altered it,\" so any further discussion was a waste of time. Mr Cook replied: \"I wouldn't wish to go down in history as the Leader of the House who demolished the chamber.\" He said electronic voting was unlikely to save much time, since MPs were still likely to be given the current eight minutes to actually get to the chamber and vote. The question time exchanges had confirmed his impression that there was not \"a settled will for change\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
