The monumental prize on offer for their club, for the owners, Venky's, and for the manager, Steve Kean, has been overlooked. \"We are at different ends of the table but I'd say the stakes are higher for us,\" Kean says. \"They are going for a record title and we are looking to secure our Premier League future. We would love to secure that against United.\" The club the Indian poultry giant bought for \u00a346m in November hovers three points above the relegation zone with a final-day trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers to follow the visit of United. It is a far cry from the Champions League aspirations and beautiful football that accompanied Venky's decision to dispense with Sam Allardyce in December and install full-time the inexperienced Kean in January, and it ensures Rovers are in no position to accept a coronation at Ewood. Not that United ever receive a comfortable stroll in this part of Lancashire, in fairness, where they have won only twice since Blackburn returned to the top flight in 2001. \"Games between us have always been tight,\" says Morten Gamst Pedersen, Rovers' Manchester-based, United-supporting midfielder. \"When I've been out in Manchester this week people have asked me to take it easy on Saturday but I have to think about my team. We are not thinking about stopping United from winning the title but keeping Blackburn in the Premier League. The points are more important to us. United will not be given the trophy at Ewood anyway, so surely it would be better for them to win it at home against Blackpool?\" Pedersen's optimism may belong to the blind category, given Rovers' predicament and United's desire to place 19 in the cabinet two weeks before a Champions League final against Barcelona, but the Norway international would not be alone in that respect. Venky's have dismayed supporters with their first moves as a Premier League owner, which have included claims of a January move for Ronaldinho, as has Kean with his policy of accentuating the positive throughout the side's slide towards trouble. Performances, however, have improved since defeat at Everton last month and the Blackburn manager welcomes his side's billing as the sideshow to a title procession. Kean says: \"It's a help to us. It was a help last week when it was all about West Ham, how it was a must-win game for them and none of the pundits gave Blackburn a mention. We got on with our business, went with a good plan and were tight as a group. This week has been all about Man United and nothing about us, which is great. It allows us to focus on our own agenda, which is six points to play for. We have five positive results out of the last seven and probably the best defensive record of the teams down there.\" Blackburn have won once in 13 league games although, as Kean stressed, four draws and a victory over Bolton in their past seven outings have kept the dotted line at bay. They also face in Ferguson an opponent who, so the conspiracy theory goes, would relish increasing Venky's torment in return for their dismissal of his old friend Allardyce. The United manager strongly condemned the managerial change at Blackburn but Allardyce's replacement has not taken the sage's words to heart. \"It was not a personal attack on me,\" Kean says. \"He never said anything negative against me or derogatory. I never felt it was against me but a backing for Sam, which I respect and understand. I think that is to be expected when someone's friend loses their job. I've got no problem with that. \"I'm sure it was a shock to Sir Alex and it is natural that he would back his friend. I've known Sir Alex for a lot of years. We are from a similar area in Glasgow and I've met him numerous times in the past 10 years and got on well with him. I saw him at Old Trafford this week and said I was looking forward to seeing him again at Ewood. Let the battle commence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
