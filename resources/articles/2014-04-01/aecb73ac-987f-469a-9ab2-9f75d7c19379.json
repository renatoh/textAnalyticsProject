In a report commissioned after the Mid-Staffordshire NHS scandal, the Commons public administration committee said many parts of the government must get better at listening to complaints. It said the government overall fails to conform to best practice on handling the public's concerns. The report recommends that a Cabinet Office minister take charge of how complaints are dealt with across the government and there should be a single point of contact for citizens to raise concerns about public services. It said ministers must personally deal with complaints brought to their attention by MPs rather than delegate them. Bernard Jenkin, the chairman of the committee, said: \"As things are, most people believe there is no point in complaining. \"Unless and until we have a culture of leadership in public services that listens to, values and responds to complaints, from service users and staff, there will always be the potential for tragedies like Mid-Staffs, and opportunities to improve services and public confidence will be missed again and again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
