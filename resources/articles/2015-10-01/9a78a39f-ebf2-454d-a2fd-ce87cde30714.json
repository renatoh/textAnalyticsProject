The pair go head to head on Saturday when the German takes Liverpool to Tottenham Hotspur for his first match in charge since replacing Brendan Rodgers. The contest has been widely billed as a meeting of like-minded managers but Pochettino says it is strange to claim that Klopp\u2019s previous club, Borussia Dortmund, played in the same way that the Argentinian introduced at Southampton and now cultivates at Spurs. Both have always preached high-energy pressing and attacking but Pochettino draws a clear distinction between their approaches. \u201cIt is a different style of pressing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you analyse Dortmund, it\u2019s not similar to how we played at Southampton. Our pressing was to the opposing goalkeeper, whereas Dortmund played with a medium block. You can\u2019t compare Klopp\u2019s style with my style, we are different. I\u2019m not saying one is better than the other, just that we are different. \u201cIt depends on your ideas, your culture, how you see the philosophy, your football,\u201d continued Pochettino. \u201cI prefer to press high and we believe we can press the keeper. Another manager believes it is better to stay with a medium block or play deep and go on the counterattack. This is how you feel and believe, and how you develop your style.\u201d The Argentinian suggested that although Klopp will need time to embed his ideas, Liverpool may show signs of an immediate impact. Pochettino said that after he arrived in England in January 2013, his Southampton team began applying his teaching in his first match in charge, a 0-0 draw with Everton. \u201cAfter two [training] sessions, in the first half against Everton they started to show that they understood how to deliver our ideas,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe first half was unbelievable, we created 10 chances, we pressed high. After that it is not easy to keep your ideas for 90 minutes because players have the automatic period and come back again. That is why you need time to settle your ideas on the players.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s striker Harry Kane has spoken of the dynamism that Pochettino has instilled in Spurs, saying this week that statistics prove Tottenham have outrun all other Premier League teams this season. \u201cIt is a good stat but football is about winning the games, not only running,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt is true our style is press and run, solidarity, being a unit. But we need to score and we need to be better with the ball than the opponent. We have a good balance between running and having possession.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
