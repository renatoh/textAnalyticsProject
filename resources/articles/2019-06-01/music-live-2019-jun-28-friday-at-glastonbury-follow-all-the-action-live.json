Stormzy! Stormzy!\u201d There\u2019s no encore and rightly so. It\u2019s fair to say he bossed this. There were no grand political speeches, as some might have hoped for (although plenty of nuanced messages through the big screen displays, interludes and stage attire). Instead, Stormzy kept it upbeat, raucous and relentless. It came and went in a flash, yet its impact will last for generations \u2013 a set that told the story of UK grime\u2019s unstoppable rise over the last two decades. \u201cThat was music history. That was black British history,\u201d says Clara Amfo. \u201cIt was a truly inclusive show.\u201d Stay tuned for our review from Alexis Petridis, posted here shortly. Thanks for joining me as Stormzy made history tonight \u2013 over and out! \u201cFinale business!\u201d It\u2019s Big For Your Boots. Did people really think Stormzy might not have enough material for this set?! Fun fact is that when this came out I thought Stormzy was rapping: \u201cI got the big size fours on my feet\u201d \u2013 making it the first UK rap song about having tiny trotters. Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2 getting the full gospel treatment here \u2013 it may as well have been written for Glastonbury. And it gets the full pyrotechnical works too. Stormzy takes a moment to take it all in ... Stormzy is down the front, topless, touching the palms of those at the front. \u201cI feel like the 25 years of my life has led up to this moment right here,\u201d he says, before namechecking the icons who made it possible: Wiley, Dizzee, Skepta, Giggs, Ghetts, Kano, Tinie Tempah, Lethal Bizzle, and then an even longer list of those coming through: Unknown T, Little Simz, Geko, Bugzy Malone, Nadia Rose, Novelist. And now it\u2019s Shut Up, taking things full circle with its sample of XTC\u2019s original grime classic Functions on the Low. Vossi Bop now, Stormzy\u2019s first UK chart-topper. Time to reflect ... it was 2005 when grime first hit Glastonbury festival, albeit on an underground scale, as DJ Cameo brought the likes of Trim and JME to the Roots tent. Since then we\u2019ve had Tinie Tempah, Skepta and Dizzee play the Pyramid stage (really, Dizzee should have headlined, because he owned it every single year). I was going to write something about grime\u2019s journey here but ..\u2026 no time, there are BMX bikers on the stage. Before that, BBC bosses quivered as a video of Ghetts cussing his mouth off was used to introduce Bad Boys. Now Dave is on the stage for Funky Friday. Meanwhile, my typing fingers are down to the actual bone and all I\u2019m doing is writing about what is happening. No time for any added commentary! Dave doesn\u2019t leave the stage without delivering an emotional message: I gotta say thank you bro, before I leave this stage. You\u2019ve made it possible, bro. You\u2019ve allowed man like us to believe, bro. This is your moment, the greatest. I love you, bro! Stormzy is addressing the crowd again before Shape of You: I was meant to bring my brother out but he\u2019s in a stadium on the other side of the world. It goes a little bit like this ... Ed Sheeran can\u2019t be here tonight? This set just gets better and better! How\u2019s it sounding in the crowd? If you\u2019re thinking Stormzy isn\u2019t feeling the pressure of this headline show, then perhaps have a listen to the lyrics to The Crown in which he wrestles with his newfound position as the voice of black Britain: \u201cI tried to be grateful and count all my blessings / But heavy is the head that wears the crown.\u201d Oh here he is. From one Glastonbury headline expert to a soon-to-be other \u2026 Chris Martin is on stage taking it to church by playing the intro to Blinded By Your Grace on a keyboard. I wonder what tips he gave him as to how you get invited back? The pair sit on the piano stool crooning together. After George Ezra\u2019s performance earlier, maybe the 90s \u201cstool-rock\u201d movement is back? More fireworks and another cover, this time Kanye\u2019s Ultralight Beam with the lyrics changed to reference \u201cfallen soldier\u201d Damiola Taylor and his South London roots. This one builds and builds to an epic crescendo Stormzy gets his gospel choir to sing the chorus for his cover of Shanks &amp; Bigfoot\u2019s Sweet Like Chocolate. This is exactly the right time in the set to switch things up with a slightly silly crowd-pleaser Stormzy is now dressed top to toe in white for Cigarettes and Cush. How is he doing all this while I can\u2019t even keep up with the typing?! There\u2019s a break and ... some choreography! Come on, who predicted ballet? \u201cNow there are ballet shoes to match all skin tones\u201d reads the video screen as two black dancers twirl gracefully around the stage. \u201cThis is the greatest night of my entire life. Who\u2019s got energy today?\u201d screams Stormzy before stripping it right back for One Track Freestyle. The slightest of breathers and we\u2019re on to First Things First. The video and lighting set up here is immense, the opposite approach to Kanye\u2019s bold but ultimately disappointing minimalist approach in 2015. It\u2019s Cold now. Stormzy performing the kind of exercise routine you can\u2019t buy at Virgin Active. There are fireworks. And a line everyone at Worthy Farm probably agrees with: \u201cSo tell Boris Johnson, \u2018suck your mum!\u2019\u201d Wearing a black union jack stab vest, Stormzy bounds on stage with energy levels turned up to 11. It\u2019s Know Me From to open things and the crowd are singing back every word. He looks the exact opposite of nervous: \u201cOi Glasto, it\u2019s only the fucking beginning!\u201d From Croydon to Pilton ... Stormzy becomes the first British rapper to headline the Pyramid stage. Strap yourselves in, this could get epic (and sweary \u2013 they\u2019re not censoring it). #merky Kieran speaks for everyone watching on TV right now And then of course there\u2019s this from today ... For Emily Eavis, this booking wasn\u2019t so much a risk as a no-brainer: When I saw him play the 2017 festival on the Other stage, I knew straight away that the next time he played he would be headlining the Pyramid. The reaction in the field was unbelievable. He\u2019s got such a presence and the energy is incredible. More Stormzy quotes to get you in the mood here from his recent interview with Dotty for Radio 1Xtra, in which he tells us what we might expect \u2026 There were so many doubters being like, \u2018Oh he hasn\u2019t got no number one song\u2019 or, \u2018Oh he\u2019s got one album out, he\u2019s not ready\u2019 \u2026 If you think you\u2019re going to give me that Glastonbury 2019 headline slot and I\u2019m not going to give you an incredible performance you\u2019ve gone mad \u2013 you\u2019ve gone crazy. I\u2019ve never come here to play games. As a musician, I take that so seriously. I\u2019m kind of done talking. There\u2019s a build-up and this time round I\u2019m ready\u2026 I got the album and we are going to show the world... exactly why I managed to get here in my career. Back in 2017, Stormzy told Miranda Sawyer on the Observer: I don\u2019t want to be the best rapper in the UK. I want to be the best artist in the UK. That takes my competitors from 20 people to 100 people, because now they\u2019re indie bands, female singers, soul singers, legends, rock icons that I\u2019m competing with. In my head I\u2019m like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I compete with them? Why can\u2019t Stormzy from south London do that as well? Tonight he will become the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury festival. What a journey. This could get emotional If you\u2019ve spent all night watching the BBC coverage tonight then you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Sheryl Crow was the biggest artist on the planet right now. Over on the ITV2 stage, it looks like a few new lads are heading into the villa \u2026 sorry, got distracted! Besides we\u2019ve no time for that, as BBC Two are back at Glastonbury with the build-up to Stormzy\u2019s set. It has the potential, I think, to be one of the all-time great Glastonbury headline slots. Yes Stormzy is a little short on material but he\u2019s also big on charisma and connection, and that\u2019s what you really need to carry a headline show like this. Plus, he seems to really \u201cget\u201d what Glastonbury is about and what it means to headline such a prestigious slot. We shall find out how he tackles the job in hand shortly \u2026 Our verdict on George Ezra is in and it\u2019s as thus: if he\u2019s as rubbish as he seems why are we all having so much fun? It\u2019s safe to say that Jorja Smith\u2019s vocals are slightly more impressive than Joe Talbot\u2019s during his rendition of Someone Like You. She\u2019s opened with Lost &amp; Found and has gone for a \u201cone leg in monochrome\u201d look that more of us should consider adopting Sat in the middle of the Venn diagram between \u201cIdles fans\u201d and \u201cpeople who like sunsets\u201d, Pip Blom blow up the little Crows Nest stage at the highest point of the Glastonbury site. Their ramshackle but highly melodic indie punk gads about with tongue-lolling energy, and sends a series of dads into raptures. It\u2019s another great guerilla booking for one of the festival\u2019s smallest but best stages, who only announce their lineup each morning; don\u2019t miss Black Midi here later. If Jorja Smith has failed so far to move beyond \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201caccomplished\u201d on record, despite the early promise of 2016\u2019s single Blue Lights, there\u2019s much more of an emotional connection in her live show. With a voice that recalls a slightly muffled Amy Winehouse circa Frank, and an aloof stage presence that means you can\u2019t take your eyes off her, she sounds genuinely annoyed at herself on Where Did I Go?, while Teenage Fantasy offers up some early opportunities for the massive crowd to dance. On Your Own is even extended into a psych-rock jam before unexpectedly morphing into Sister Nancy\u2019s Bam Bam. At one point, she acknowledges her lack of upbeat material before running through a medley that touches on Drake\u2019s One Dance and ends with her bringing out rapper AJ Tracey for Ladbroke Grove. Of course Smith\u2019s just as comfortable dealing with languid R&amp;B (the lovely Lost and Found), but, occasionally, when the songs aren\u2019t strong enough to carry the weight of the atmospherics \u2013 as on Wandering Romance \u2013 festival-goers\u2019 attention starts to drift. But as the sun sets, you can\u2019t deny her this early career-defining moment. Sheryl Crow has kindly launched into an extended harmonica solo which can only mean one thing \u2013 I get to go for a toilet break. George Ezra\u2019s tedious anecdotes about interrailing around Europe might make me reconsider my previously sunny disposition towards his set. In fact, I\u2019m ditching him and heading to BBC Four now for some coverage before Stormzy starts at 9:50pm on BBC Two. Sheryl Crow is currently telling us that there is only one thing she wants to do (and it\u2019s not, surprisingly, sit in the Guardian office on a Friday night liveblogging). Playing to a truly rammed Park stage, the crowd stretching up the hill to the next little stage of the Bimble Inn, Bristol\u2019s soul-baring, chest-baring, underpants-baring punks seize their moment. What sets them apart is a sentimental streak as wide as the Park\u2019s famous vista \u2013 dedicating songs to mums, nurses and the NHS at large. \u201c I come here and feel like I\u2019m part of something bigger than myself,\u201d frontman Joe Talbot tells the crowd, like a televangelist, and his frank admissions about alcoholism and depression are like truths told in a 12-step program. Perhaps this earnestness is what winds up their critical peers like Sleaford Mods and Fat White Family; the band are very well aware of the beefs, but it\u2019s that earnestness that has earned them ever growing crowds like this. Crucially, they offset it with sarky, propulsive punk, which also makes the injokes - like singing bits of Adele\u2019s Someone Like You and Pyramid stage star Sheryl Crow\u2019s All I Wanna Do \u2013 cute rather than annoying. Perhaps they lack a little bit of range; they often cleave to songs that rely on builds and drops. But in Danny Nedelko, they have a football chant anthem that will light the way to even bigger stages. The end of Lauryn Hill\u2019s set looked great on iPlayer but apparently it was a mixed bag for those who caught the full thing IRL. Here\u2019s Ammar Kalia\u2019s three-star review. For those wondering why Ezra is sat on a stool for the biggest gig of his life \u2013 he rolled his ankle running and can\u2019t stand very well. OK, have switched over to George Ezra, an artist whose fake-bluesman shtick I found incomprehensible for a long time until my nephews played him repeatedly during a recent visit to their house. The earworm must have wriggled inside because I found myself sneakily playing Paradise and Shotgun in the car on the way home. Ezra is not going to challenge your preconceptions of what math-rock can achieve, but on a sunny festival stage he\u2019s basically the dream booking. Here are some superfans who\u2019d been queuing at the Pyramid all day for a top spot ... Idles are now covering a medley of Sheryl Crow\u2019s All I Wanna Do and Adele\u2019s Someone Like You. Possibly they\u2019re doing both songs at the same time, such a racket it is. Now they\u2019ve moved on to Nothing Compares 2 U and a Harry Styles number. This is quite ... weird. Not sure anyone will top this Glastonbury coverage ... can anyone get Tim a job at the Beeb? Idles not only playing an incendiary set but also seem to have stellar advice for other bands on the bill struggling with this heatwave \u2013 simply play in your pants! Every time Lauryn Hill is booked to play a gig, one eternal question arises: will she show? And if she does, how late will she be? So many have Ms Hill\u2019s missed appearances been that to her fans, just the virtue of her turning up seems enough to justify the ticket price. So, at 6.10pm on the Pyramid Stage, 10 minutes after the scheduled start, there was a palpable nervous energy that rippled through the gigantic crowd. Hill\u2019s tour DJ valiantly spun the classic pre-gig fillers: Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot, et al. but the audience was beginning to reckon with another disappointment. Gladly, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five\u2013piece band. Currently winding up a 20th anniversary tour in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill\u2019s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader\u2019s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song. Opening with the anthemic Lost Ones, Hill\u2019s vocals were breathless and somewhat patchy, leaving the bulk of the singing to her harmonising backing trio. It was only on the Fugees\u2019 classic, Killing Me Softly With His Song, which opened with a solo vocal, that a glimpse of Hill\u2019s true talent shone through. Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the IRS and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus. BBC Two\u2019s coverage has stopped so I\u2019ve jumped over to iPlayer to watch the incomparable Idles \u2026 Joe Talbot has just delivered an impassioned tribute to his wife, Elizabeth, who has \u201csacrificed all this bullshit\u201d to raise their child. He asks the crowd to cheer on the mums out there before launching into Mother (some especially good rolling of the \u201cR\u201ds going on here). The thing I like most about this Charlatans performance (other than the dungarees) is how youthful Tim Burgess looks ... and how bad the rest of the band do. A real Dorian Gray thing going on. Won\u2019t anybody think of Rob S? He can\u2019t see a thing for your stupid flags. Rosal\u00eda does not need a wind machine to make clear that she is cooler than literally everybody else at Glastonbury: that much is evident within seconds of her hyper-stylish performance on the John Peel stage. Surrounded by female dancers in matching long, dark ponytails, she flashes between tenderness and a mode best described as \u201ccome and \u2019ave a go\u201d as she flexes through her kinetic flamenco-rooted pop. When she sings one song totally a cappella, her voice flutters and billows like one of the flags steaming over the Pyramid stage, and the sight of a man in the front row singing \u2013 and truly feeling \u2013 every word makes her lip tremble, her effort to suppress tears palpable. But suddenly, she shifts to a tone of admonishment, summoning a palpable wrath and vengeance that transcends the language barrier (although there are an impressive number of people singing along). Her set \u2013 at first bafflingly under-attended, but soon rammed \u2013 is a masterclass in how to pull off heightened craft without quashing the emotion, in contrasts of light and dark. The traditional palmas \u2013 handclaps \u2013 girding her songs are hardened to uncompromisingly tough beats; one song orbits around the strum of a Spanish guitar, processed and repeated into a subaqueous, menacing pattern. Meanwhile, Barefoot in the Park, her duet with James Blake (not here today) is as light as peachy cirrus. It\u2019s phenomenal, whether she\u2019s performing alone or with her girl gang, and the unrelenting spells of between song applause come as no surprise. Comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 are audible in the post-show chatter. It\u2019s the rare occasion that they don\u2019t feel like hyperbole. I\u2019ve barely had time to compute Tim Burgess\u2019s blonde mop and dungarees combo and now BBC2\u2019s coverage has started with the promise of music from Jorja Smith and others. First up, though, is \u2026 er, Bastille and Lewis Capaldi (the problem with liveblogging is you can\u2019t leg it to the healing tents during moments like these). There\u2019s a bit of a buzz about Rosal\u00eda\u2019s Glastonbury set (\u201cIf you\u2019re not at Rosal\u00eda you\u2019re missing out\u201d \u2013 Laura Snapes, 2019). You can find out more about Madonna\u2019s favourite flamenco star by reading tomorrow\u2019s Guardian Guide cover feature here. Norman, Norman ... if there\u2019s one thing you should have learned about Glastonbury by now it\u2019s that: 1) Nobody wants to be reminded about the toilets. 2) And nobody wants to be reminded just how much cleaner the backstage ones are. So while our writers head off to indulge themselves in the joys of a sunny Glastonbury, you lot now have the joy of following along live with me, Tim Jonze, from the Guardian\u2019s rather less sunny office. I forgot my cider, sadly, but I do have a steaming hot cup of FOMO beside me right now. Still, we\u2019ve got the television \u2013 and each other \u2013 so we\u2019re surely in for a fun-packed Friday night. I\u2019ve just tuned into Lauryn Hill singing the beautiful To Zion, which seems a fairly good place to start as we build up to Stormzy\u2019s historic set. Great lineup tonight up at the Crow\u2019s Nest \u2013 essentially a grab bag of the best in new indie. With the best view on the whole site! My first Vegan Fried Chicken hot wings \u2013 I\u2019ll be honest, I wouldn\u2019t mistake this battered seitan for chicken even after seven pints of cider, but they are indeed \u201cperfectly pleasant\u201d as my Glasto guinea pig put it, especially with a liberal sloshing of tangy hot sauce to disguise the fact wheat protein doesn\u2019t actually taste of anything. \u201cNo annoying bones either\u201d she observes (ah, those annoying chickens with their inconvenient skeletons). Perfect 2am Glasto food. It\u2019s one rule for them and it\u2019s one rule for us, eh? The Charlatans are on right now, on the Other Stage \u2013 a last minute booking after Snow Patrol pulled out due to injuries in the band. Lauryn Hill is currently on the Pyramid stage. Ammar Kalia is watching: \u201cOnly 15 minutes late, she is playing a gospel-focused rendition of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, on its 20th anniversary, featuring an extended reggae breakdown version of Forgive Them Father and a high-energy Everything Is Everything. The crowd is drifting in and out of attention, though, as she keeps cutting to vocal breaks and recorded album skits.\u201d Full review to come after the set. Our celeb-spotting has been a bit rubbish to be honest. Team Guardian have spotted Dominic Cooper, Zo\u00eb Ball, and that\u2019s about it so far ... except for Dua Lipa, who everyone seems to have seen everywhere. She is out there, to use the appropriate parlance, serving looks. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has wished Stormzy well with his headline set tonight. You may remember that Corbs has form in this regard \u2013 he celebrated the rapper at the 2017 GQ and Mobo awards, saying: \u201cThis year grime artists played a huge part in setting the agenda for British music and, in the General Election, your contribution helped secure the highest youth turnout in a quarter of a century, showing the positive impact grime has on our society.\u201d Stormzy for his part told the Guardian in 2016: \u201cMy man, Jeremy! Young Jeremy, my guy. I dig what he says. I saw some sick picture of him from back in the day when he was campaigning about anti-apartheid and I thought: yeah, I like your energy ... I feel like he gets what the ethnic minorities are going through and the homeless and the working class.\u201d Also delivering best wishes is, er, Raymond Blanc. Our reporter Lanre Bakare has been exploring how British jazz is continuing to have A Moment \u2013 half the Glastonbury lineup seems to be various jazz outfits playing solo or joining forces. Paging Felicity! This wisdom sounds like it was extremely hard-won. And in other food-related commentary: Anyone looking for spiritual enlightenment would have gone some way to finding it at BCUC\u2019s show at West Holts. The Soweto-based band say that \u201cmusic has the power to heal our minds by freeing our bodies\u201d, and they pair ancestral rhythms with raucous punk energy. At times, the frontman screeches like a metaller. The six-piece give everyone a masterclass in how to hype the crowd, with their drum-heavy party music, freewheeling into jazz and gospel, and nonstop dancing. Then they wryly announce: \u201cAnd now, we are going to begin our set\u201d. They are, perhaps, the only band at this festival who can make a vuvuzela solo sound good. But there is also an underlying political undertone, as their singer says that \u201cwhite people have been in South Africa for generations\u201d and so it was \u201cimportant to find a way to live together\u201d. Congas, bass drum and bass collide in a shadowy, sometimes dub-indebted fusion and then erupts into something resembling happy hardcore, Zulu style. By the sounds of the yells from the crowd, plenty of people have found themselves here this afternoon. The Fiona Apple vibes are strong this weekend: Billie Eilish\u2019s showtunes side owes a debt to the LA songwriter, as does the finely wrought melancholy of young New Yorker King Princess. KP \u2013 AKA Mikaela Strauss \u2013 was only born in 1998, but her music is steeped in 90s angst, all gritted-teeth delivery and shimmering soft rock, with an All Saints-style crop top and low-slung baggy jeans to match. But she\u2019s just as much a product of her era, subverting traditional torch songcraft further by centring her perspective as a queer woman. Her single 1950 is a heavenly devotional to a lover, also a tribute to the pioneering lesbians of the past who had to love in secret, and a gorgeous singalong moment. Then there\u2019s Pussy Is God, a self-explanatory number that hews closer to low-key contemporary R&amp;B \u2013 although it\u2019s a little indistinct for such a strident sentiment. So is her set as a whole. Little comes close to the rapturous 1950, it\u2019s all a bit too mid-range, and low on the intrigue that allows Lana Del Rey to elevate similar fare to a cult concern. Bringing on Mark Ronson \u2013 who signed Strauss to his label \u2013 adds a brief frisson of recognition but not much more. Saying that, the woozy pace is perfect for a crowd worn down by the piercing heat. I\u2019m in Control, our Janet Jackson themed interrogation of Glastonbury-goers, continues with Stefanie and Andy \u2013 they tell us what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Stefanie: They should make the whole thing vegetarian like Mandala does. I know it\u2019s on a farm and they promote veganism, but if they\u2019re gonna practice what they preach it should be full. Andy: A full immersive experience of the culture they\u2019re trying to provide. Upon entering the festival they should say, this is the world we are trying to create. People who think they hate veggie food would probably be pleasantly surprised. Stefanie: Apart from that I wouldn\u2019t change anything. We are nitpicking because we love this place! Michael Eavis, the festival\u2019s founding father, has been telling an adoring audience on the Acoustic stage that T Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan was his favourite ever Glastonbury act. Eavis, 83, said that after the Kinks dropped out of the first ever Glastonbury festival in 1970, Bolan agreed to step in for \u00a3500, paid in \u00a3100 monthly instalments. \u201cHe was absolutely amazing,\u201d Eavis said. \u201cHe was so good. It was a lovely sunny evening ... and 500 lovely hippies turned up and it was really wonderful. We lost a fortune actually. And to this day he is still one of my heroes of all time.\u201d He reminisced about the time David Bowie played at 4.30am on the summer solstice in 1971. \u201cHe looked good, with his long hair. He was dressed like a duchess or something.\u201d Eavis said he would carry on running the festival for \u201canother 10 years at least\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for Fleetwood Mac one day, but we can\u2019t afford them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to bring their prices down\u201d \u2013 perhaps putting paid to rumours the band would headline the festival\u2019s 50th anniversary next year. UK garage producer Conducta is making his Glastonbury debut tonight and has announced it in the waviest fashion imaginable. Those not schooled in the Mac DeMarco style of spacey yacht rock, who stumbled across his sun\u2013drenched afternoon set on the Other Stage, could be forgiven for thinking his band were playing a parody of their music; a novelty group entertaining a crowd that\u2019s well in on the joke. That joke seemed to reach its peak with DeMarco\u2019s 2019 album, Here Comes the Cowboy, which includes songs like Choo Choo \u2013 featuring the refrain \u201cChoo choo take a ride with me\u201d \u2013 and the title track, which simply repeats \u201chere comes the cowboy\u201d over and over. Live, the trolling continued, with the ensemble pulling antics that ranged from DeMarco\u2019s handstand with a cigarette in his mouth, and playing the guitar behind his back, a topless clave break from the rhythm guitarist, and an extended musing on the best pies in the UK, prompted by the Real Sausages and Real Mash stand opposite. Yet, behind all the effrontery is DeMarco\u2019s silky smooth voice and infectious hooks. His band are a well-oiled machine, seamlessly moving through the spangly Americana of his breakout previous records, Salad Days and This Old Dog, keeping the crowd hooked on every key change and instrumental break. Ultimately, it\u2019s hard to know where DeMarco the songwriter ends and DeMarco the performer begins \u2013 or whether there is a difference there at all \u2013 but beneath the cheap laughs is a true musical talent, one which could really capture our attention if it was given a little more room to breathe. That Lewis Capaldi gets about doesn\u2019t he? Here he is popping up during Bastille\u2019s Pyramid stage set, just after his secret set for BBC Introducing. Bastille\u2019s lead singer Dan draped himself in an EU flag too. More people are telling us what they would do if they controlled Glastonbury (our nod to Janet Jackson\u2019s masterful Control). Here\u2019s good-egg-looking Nick. I wouldn\u2019t want to change much to be honest. The way they do it is spot on. They seem to get a good balance between new acts and legends. If I had to pick a legend for that slot next year I\u2019d go for Elton John. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d be too big for that slot but he could always do the Sunday. I also feel that this year there are too many people here, it\u2019s so rammed, so I\u2019d look into that. But everything else is spot on. I sound like such a super fan but I manage things for a living and it\u2019s so well done here. The atmosphere is so, so good. Our news reporters Lanre Bakare and Frances Perraudin have been assessing the general Glastonbury sentiment towards Boris Johnson. Let\u2019s just say he might want to focus on building a bus from a wine box rather than read the story below. Petit fours \u2013 because who can walk past a sign for an ice cream sandwich without putting off the alternative folk bagpipe rock for a minute? \u00a35 gets you two chocolate cookies with any ice cream flavour you like from the Mendip Moments menu. I\u2019d recommend the banana and salted caramel, and also eating it before it melts all over the clothes you\u2019re planning to wear for the next three days. Fontaines DC seem hellbent on claiming the prize of hardest working band at Glasto. Clearly the three performances the Dublin post-punkers have already lined up at the festival are not sufficient \u2013 they step in at the last minute here after illness put paid to Sam Fender\u2019s set. That work ethic is very much on show in their taut, coiled spring of a set too. Singer Grian Chatten marauds across the stage, radiating a sulky, scratchy intensity. You can barely draw your eyes away from him, a point not lost on the rest of the band: at one point, in a desperate piece of daredevil attention-seeking, guitarist Carlos O\u2019Connell climbs up the John Peel rig, strumming away as he dangles. He needn\u2019t have bothered: Fontaines are exciting enough without the high-wire act, rattling furiously through standouts Big and Boys in the Better Land and prompting an unlikely singalong moment with the barked chorus of Too Real. It\u2019ll be a tough set to top \u2013 though they\u2019ve got three more chances to do just that this weekend. Bastille are currently playing the Pyramid to serious whoops and sunshine euphoria. In honour of Janet Jackson playing the Pyramid stage tomorrow \u2013 including the absolute diamond banger Control \u2013 we\u2019re asking Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Up next is Jo Shepherd: \u201cSeriously, if I was in charge, I\u2019d love to see Thirty Seconds to Mars on the main stage. Also, McFly need to be on the Pyramid stage too, 100%. I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019d also make sure there weren\u2019t any clashes between big female artists like there are this year. I\u2019d also get Foals to headline next year, because they\u2019ve released an incredible album and have one on the way. I\u2019d love the 1975 to appear too. Actually, I\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t here this year. In terms of the festival in general, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It\u2019s such a special place.\u201d Next in our Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly, Conor thinks Brexit is unfixable: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can fix Brexit. I think it\u2019s unfixable, a shit show. We have to go along with what we\u2019ve voted as a country, whatever people think about which side is right or wrong, because if we don\u2019t go along with it, in the long run ... there will be a much worse Brexit, an unconceivable Brexit where someone like Tommy Robinson gets in [to power]. When people don\u2019t think they\u2019re thought about, or cared about, they often go to extremes.\u201d Gareth Colvin of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has a tip for campers struggling with the heat. \u201cI came to Glastonbury on Wednesday morning. The sun was beaming down on me. I woke up really early, and I said \u2018I\u2019m not having another night like that.\u2019\u201d He left the site, drove to a camping shop an hour and a half away, bought a foil blanket, and returned and taped it over his tent with gaffer tape. \u201cAnd it was really cool this morning. It was like sleeping in a fridge, it was lovely.\u201d The solar-powered fairy lights are not only festive, but demarcate their area, says Colvin. \u201cAnd they\u2019re energy efficient.\u201d Three years after the Brexit vote took place during Glastonbury weekend, and with growing desire for a people\u2019s assembly to discuss what to do about leaving the EU, we\u2019re creating our own Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 asking everyone for their take on what to do next. Over to Rachel and Leslie: Leslie: \u201c[The Irish backstop] was always there \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t talked about [in the first referendum]. So no one could make a valid judgement. The only judgements people made were from the heart.\u201d Rachel: \u201cWe need to have another referendum. I think people are realising the complexity of it. However, it isn\u2019t democratic to do that \u2013 that\u2019s the only dilemma.\u201d For dessert, Vietnamese squid with lime, coriander, garlic, chilli and fish sauce, from the brilliantly named Squid Inc \u2013 smooth and tender as a soft-boiled egg, with a savoury hit from the fish sauce (which they say hails from the beautiful island of Phu Quoc, bringing back painful memories of a holiday where everyone refused to come on a guided tour of the nam pla factory with me). Could have done with a bit more crisping if I\u2019m being nitpicky, but I finished it anyway, obviously Is there anything more joyful than watching a young act experience their first big Glastonbury moment? Up on the Park stage, Georgia\u2019s intriguing one-woman setup \u2013 an electronic drum kit made up of red hexagon-shaped pads \u2013 draws in curious onlookers, who leave converted by her bass-heavy, emotionally gripping electronic pop: halfway between pirate radio bootleg and Chicago house, sweet as Tegan and Sara yet spooky as Fever Ray. It\u2019s even more impressive, given that she\u2019s playing a set of largely unheard material \u2013 Georgia was supposed to release her second album this year, but the runaway success of singles Started Out and About Work the Dancefloor, both A-listed at Radio 1, prompted her surprised label Domino to push it back to give her time to build. Judging by the response in the field, they\u2019ve got gold on their hands: you know a song is good when it prompts the crowd to manifest a spontaneous, unified dance move, as happens when she plays a track likely titled Pick Up Your Ray Guns (the move is self-explanatory). With their pummelling rhythm sections, many of her songs have a battle cry energy \u2013 \u201cThey can try and stop us now but they won\u2019t succeed\u201d; \u201cA little bit of nonsense to create disturbance\u201d \u2013 which makes them feel of this politicised moment (the stage is surrounded by posters encouraging environmental activism) in a totally natural way, by comparisson with how laboured much of today\u2019s explicitly woke pop can feel. For emphasis, she raises her drumsticks above her head in a warrior pose, and hops off her rig for the occasional celebratory jump, her tight curls bouncing \u2013 a display that\u2019s totally endearing and totally earned. Her set brilliantly juxtaposes grit and tenderness. On one slinky, creeping song, she raps menacingly about vodka jello and amaretto; on a tender, slower love song, she shows her knack for singing with power and vulnerability. She also dedicates a track to a friend\u2019s father who died yesterday, and who attended the first ever Glastonbury festival in 1970. But Georgia\u2019s crowning glory is her frisky club pop, and she closes with the two songs that kickstarted this new phase of her career, one that looks to take her from indie curio to genuine star: after About Work the Dancefloor, a song worthy of Robyn in her Body Talk era, she tells a crowd as sweaty from dancing as from the 28 degree heat that she is lost for words, and seems genuinely humbled. It gets better: she teases the beginning of Started Out, singing its verses tenderly before triggering the sexy, fidgety Mr Fingers-indebted beat. Everyone loses it. The only way it could be better is if it were 2am, not 2pm. A star. Heartening news for fans of Two Door Cinema Club: after a break-in at their lockup, a giant fire extinguisher stage prop was nicked, but it\u2019s found their way back to them just in time for their Other Stage set at 8.15pm tonight. It\u2019s unclear whether Sheryl Crow alters her rules vis-a-vis toilet paper at a festival. For those who don\u2019t have this story locked in their memory banks, in 2007 Crow suggested people should limit themselves to one sheet of loo roll per visit, or two to three for those \u201cpesky occasions\u201d. She doesn\u2019t offer up any answers during her mid afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage (her first appearance here in 22 years), when the crowd is a sea of fold-out chairs, three quarter length shorts and sensible hats. She and her seven-piece band don\u2019t waste much time either, opening with If It Makes You Happy \u2013 she bellows out the \u201cI still like to get stoned\u201d line with extra gusto \u2013 before segueing into a beefed up A Change Will Do You Good, which features an altered lyric: \u201cWe need a change in America / that\u2019s all I got to say\u201d. The hits keep coming: for All I Wanna Do, she waltzes along the front row doling out advice \u2013 \u201cYou need to put on some sunscreen\u201d she says to one woman, while a man is urged to drink more water \u2013 before an elongated My Favourite Mistake sees her venturing up into the wings. The hit-heavy start means the set sags slightly when songs from this August\u2019s Threads are aired back to back, but there\u2019s enough charisma on stage to keep people\u2019s attention. Especially cute is when she name checks her two young sons before the planet-focused The Best of Times, the pair acting as guitar techs for the set. The environmental theme continues later when she dedicates the gorgeously lilting Soak Up the Sun to Greta Thunberg. By the time the classic Everyday Is a Winding Road kicks in, she\u2019s back in the crowd\u2019s palm, posing for photos and even sharing a kiss with a sunburnt punter. The secret sets are starting \u2013 Lewis Capaldi turned up unannounced on the BBC Introducing Stage earlier this afternoon. Sturdy helping of beef and vegetable momos from the Tibetan Kitchen, a bit of a bargain as part of the festival\u2019s Food for a Fiver meal deal initiative (look for the stickers on menus - over 75% of stalls are taking part). Just half of this has left me unable to dance for the rest of the afternoon. Make sure you get a big dollop of the chunky chilli and garlic sauce \u2014 it really makes it. The temperature is spiking and the vibes are currently extremely strong. The image below is actually from Glastonbury, not Coachella! Sheryl Crow has had a rapturous singalong reception on the Pyramid stage \u2013 we\u2019ll review her set shortly. Three years after the Brexit vote took place during Glastonbury weekend, and with growing desire for a people\u2019s assembly to discuss what to do about leaving the EU, we\u2019re creating our own Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 asking everyone for their take on what to do next. First up it\u2019s George, 25, from London. \u201cWe definitely need a people\u2019s vote, because the first one seemed to be rigged. Why should we be bound by that one decision they make? It\u2019s an outdated system. Failing that, we should just put Boris in the bin.\u201d Tomorrow we\u2019ll have Lauren Cochrane assessing the fashion trends of Glastonbury 2019, but I can\u2019t see how anyone will top these fine specimens dressed at Glastonbury 2019. Name a more iconic duo, etc, etc. Could there be a little special appearance at each others\u2019 sets? Kudos to anyone who spots Gary Lineker! Bonus points if he\u2019s attempting coitus with some potato snacks. Lots of bonus points. \u201c2 SLEEPS UNTIL KYLIE\u201d \u2013 our favourite flag so far! First conversation of the day: \u201cYou said you want to see Acid Mother\u2019s Temple? Japanese? Very hairy? They\u2019re camped just down there. Eating a pack of Pringles for their breakfast.\u201d Breakfast of champions: hall of famers in the eastern chapter of krautrock, they bring the noise to West Holts. The erupting opening, the unapologetic dirge, the bit where the motorik beat hits, the guitar tickling, the beards \u2013 splendid beards, best of the festival already ... thank the cosmic heavens for letting Kawabata Makoto and the changing cast of the band loose once again. As one of the Guardian\u2019s food writers, I\u2019ve been sent on a quest to find the greatest food at Glastonbury. Across the weekend I\u2019ll be posting my finds \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear your tips! Post in the comments of the liveblog, or tweet me @FelicityCloake. First stop: The Peckish Peacock, largely chosen because it has a big sign declaring it Festival Caterer of the Year 2018 and I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Fabulous crisp onion pakoras (I called them bhajis but they were nice about it) and a Very Wholesome spinach and chickpea curry. Luckily I travel with my own salt (of course I do). The Left Field stage, Glastonbury\u2019s home of activism and political discussion, opened today with a debate on the legacy of Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d, featuring testimony from individuals who had been directly affected by it. Joining the panel\u2019s host, Guardian columnist John Harris, was Michael Braithwaite, a special needs teaching assistant who lost his job in 2016 after being told his immigration status was questionable. Braithwaite, who came to Britain from Trinidad in 1961, only had his status resolved after his story was featured in the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the Windrush scandal. He said that he was one of the lucky ones, compared with those who have been imprisoned or deported as a result of the hostile environment policy. Another panellist, Laura Clarke, told of how her partner was denied a UK visa due to a Home Office rule that says UK citizens must meet a minimum income threshold of \u00a318,600 for sponsoring a foreign spouse. Clarke met her partner Biniyam Tesfaye while teaching in Ethiopia, but she and her son had been separated from Tesfaye for much of the past three years because of the \u201ccruel\u201d measure. \u201cMy partner missed Christmas, birthdays, even our son\u2019s birth,\u201d she said. Also on the panel were Guardian commentator Gary Younge and Minnie Rahman of charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Young told the audience that the Windrush scandal was a direct result of a mischaracterisation of immigrants. \u201cThere\u2019s a notion that immigrants are people who take and scrounge \u2013 when in fact they help built this country,\u201d he said. Continuing our I\u2019m in Control feature where \u2013 in honour of Janet Jackson \u2013 we ask punters what they would do if they were in charge of Glastonbury, Georgie Rogers offers her thoughts: \u201cI\u2019d want everyone to be able to teleport from area to area so we can maximise party time and save our feet.\u201d In what was described by an audience member as a \u201cvery brave\u201d move, Zac Goldsmith appeared on stage at Glastonbury\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Forum on Friday afternoon. The Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate was booed on to the platform, with members of the audience unveiling a banner reading: \u201cTory policy kills. Don\u2019t greenwash the lives lost to austerity.\u201d Goldsmith, an environmentalist and editor of the Ecologist magazine, said there was a role for civil disobedience in combatting climate change. \u201cI think there is a massive place for pressure, whether it\u2019s civil disobedience or direct action or peaceful protest,\u201d he said in response to a question from the audience. \u201cNormally I think a protest is more effective if it doesn\u2019t annoy ordinary people but being heard is essential. I\u2019ve seen the effect of people being heard on parliament in the last few months.\u201d Asked, yes or no, if he supported the Extinction Rebellion movement, he said \u201cYes\u201d. Questioned about his support for Boris Johnson in the Conservative party leadership race, Goldsmith insisted that the front-runner was not a climate change sceptic. But as recently as 2015, Johnson claimed that \u201cglobal leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear \u2013 as far as I understand the science \u2013 is equally without foundation.\u201d \u201cHe is really not a climate sceptic,\u201d said Goldsmith. \u201cHe has written many, many things talking about the imperative of taking action of climate change.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the issue of drug-taking came up, in light of Tory-leadership hopefuls being forced to come clan about their histories with illegal substances. \u201cI was expelled from school for drugs, so I can\u2019t really deny it,\u201d said Goldsmith, who elaborated that he had smoked \u201cold fashioned Jamaican woodbine\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think what people get up to in their private lives, particularly before they become an MP, is relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most people have done things that they would rather not see in a newspaper. But one thing that should emerge from this episode is that parliament and government need to acknowledge that drugs laws don\u2019t work.\u201d Glasto is heavy on UK jazz this year and flying the flag, quite literally at the Park stage, are Steam Down, a young 11-piece from south London, one of whom has seemingly been employed just to wave their logo-printed banner in the air during the show. Steam Down are notable among the jazz community for their weekly roadblock jam session in a tiny Deptford space, in which they encourage audience participation and a communal spirit, so it\u2019s curious to see how their spiritual jazz, Afrofuturist spoken word and DIY vibe will fare al fresco, when everyone is sitting down and eating overpriced falafel. Turns out, their set works brilliantly. Though it takes a while for the energy to get going, their show is loose and free-flowing, as opposed to overly staged. Each player is moving to their own beat \u2013 you can lock into Rosie Turton\u2019s trombone, or Wonky Logic\u2019s woozy keytar, and find your own cosmic groove. On lead vocals, meanwhile, Nadeem Din-Gabisi is the Andre 3000 to Brother Portrait\u2019s Big Boi, whose playful delivery contrasts with his co-pilot\u2019s Ghostpoet-style enunciation. What\u2019s striking, though, is the band\u2019s range. They bring out dancers for the afrobeat-punchy Infinity, clear the stage for an understated duet between the two female vocalists and guest Sampa the Great, and have just as many neo-soul songs as they do sax solos. Their best moments, however, are the upbeat, rowdier ones, a shot of positivity and a vital celebration of genres \u2013 grime, dub, jazz \u2013 that underline the new sound of London. As far as inspirations for songs go, 21-year-old Leicester singer-songwriter Mahalia seems to have it down pat: \u201cI like to write songs about the guys that I like, the dickheads, the girls that I like and the bitches,\u201d she said defiantly as she opened her early-afternoon set on the John Peel stage. Channeling the confessional lyricism of Brandy and early-2000s American neo soul, Mahalia\u2019s honeyed vocals were pitch-perfect as she launched through a selection of songs from her debut album, Diary of Me, and the Seasons EP: the infectious melodies of self-empowerment anthem Do Not Disturb, the trap-soul One Night Only and the jazz-laden Sober. She has a new album coming in September, and the way new single Sinner sounded, with its radio-friendly dancehall rhythm and full-throated chorus, it is set to push Mahalia further into the mainstream. Singing with a permanent smile and dropping out of vocal lines to take regular dance-breaks, Mahalia\u2019s enthusiasm rippled through the crowd \u2013 the perfect enlivener to start the festival. \u201cIt\u2019s my third time at Glastonbury and it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s not raining,\u201d hollers Danish agit-pop practitioner M\u00d8 to suitably relieved cheers. Not that she\u2019s dressed for the occasion, with long lace gloves and a wide brimmed black hat making her look like she\u2019s about to bury a lover. It\u2019s a suitable look for a pop star who veers closer to underlying angst than the shimmering synth scapes of her fellow Scandinavians. Despite last year\u2019s underrated third album, Forever Neverland, disappearing without trace, she wins over a surprisingly vast crowd, initiating clapalongs during Pilgrim, pogoing during Burn and shouting out the festival organisers for ditching plastic bottles before introducing the next song as \u201cnot being about water, but wine\u201d, while swigging a glass of red. For the dancehall-tinged Nostalgia, she even gets in the crowd, moshing with the fourth row, before a closing double whammy of her Major Lazer collaboration Lean On and certified banger Final Song cements her as the festival\u2019s early highlight. Hearty applause to our fellow media types at the Metro for this wonderfully troll-y story. Bj\u00f6rn Again\u2019s aesthetic in a nutshell: fake Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s name is written on the back of his polyester blue kimono in comic sans. Opening the Pyramid stage, the fantastically low-rent Abba tribute act leave no potential gag uncracked \u2013 including throwing scratch cards into the crowd during Money, Money, Money \u2013 and play up the couples\u2019 relationship travails in a display hammier than what the nearby sausage stall has on offer. It is, of course, glorious: Benny is in red, fittingly resembling pop\u2019s Santa as he delivers some of the greatest songs of all time to the giant crowd with such extreme gusto you can only imagine his piano keys are reduced to stumps. A woman in the crowd drinks a box of Pinot Grigio straight from the tap. This is the correct response. Not even Fake Benny deciding to drop a rap breakdown during Take a Chance on Me can spoil proceedings, nor the group\u2019s accents, which make the Muppets\u2019 Swedish chef sound like a native speaker, nor the tumbleweed that bounces across the field as Benny claims during a crowd sing-off that his side has the most Stormzy fans: the Venn diagram of their fanbases appears to be two distinct circles. What is bittersweet is the tantalising prospect of the real thing doing it one day \u2013 though going by the evident love behind Bj\u00f6rn Again, their tatty props and golf ball-sized crystal adornments, you suspect the four champs on stage wouldn\u2019t mind being put out of business by the real thing. Until then, long May the ringers reign. Another highlight from yesterday was England\u2019s 3-0 win in the Women\u2019s World Cup, screened on the West Holts stage to jubilant effect. Extinction Rebellion staged a major protest yesterday, which culminated in this pretty stunning helicopter shot: Read up on it all below. Meanwhile at the Unfairground, Glastonbury gonna Glastonbury. In honour of Janet Jackson playing the Pyramid stage tomorrow \u2013 including the absolute diamond banger Control \u2013 we\u2019re asking Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in control of the festival. First up to the plate is Roseanne, 27, from London. \u201cIf I had control of Glasto I\u2019d make myself Stormzy\u2019s backing dancer or hype girl. I\u2019d put more showers around, definitely. And I\u2019d let everyone have VIP access for the day or at least give me and my friends a backstage pass.\u201d Everyone goes on about how magical and spiritual Glastonbury is, but, you know, it sort of is? The Vaccines are kicking off the Other stage. You might have expected them to headline it at some point, but indie-rock has waned hard out of the zeitgeist \u2013 a bit of a shame for them, as their last album Combat Sports was their best yet. Well, at least one guy is in absolute raptures. Unveiled at the top of the site, near the Park stage, is a collaboration between Tory antagonists Led By Donkeys and Steve McFadden-based collagist Cold War Steve. Headlining tonight is Stormzy, who has posted an emotive message to Twitter ahead of his performance: What better way to kick off Glastonbury with some free-improv math punk fronted by a man who sounds as if someone force-fed Jeff Buckley a fistful of hornets? If there is one, a surprising amount of people haven\u2019t found it, judging by the packed William\u2019s Green tent for Black Midi\u2019s breakfast set. The Brit School graduates\u2019 (yep, really ) brand of managed chaos can frustrate on record \u2013 not least because of vocalist Geordie Greep\u2019s mannered, strangulated howl. But live it makes sense in a strange way, the passages of meandering jazz giving way to some genuinely thrilling, doomy riffage. A bracing, bludgeoning wake-up call. Ammar Kalia has just met yet more people who can\u2019t get enough of George Ezra, and are camping out at the very front of the Pyramid stage all day long. Kate, 25; Matt, 26 Kate: It\u2019s our first time at Glastonbury, and we were so excited when they announced George Ezra was playing. W e had to get here early and get right to the front. We\u2019ve got coffee and rum to keep us going, and we can\u2019t wait to hear Paradise in the sun. Carol, 50; Mike, 52 Carol: it\u2019s my first time at any festival and my first time camping. We had to get to the front for George Ezra \u2013 he\u2019s just so fun and always has a great time when he\u2019s on stage. We\u2019ve got George in the sun and pink G&amp;Ts \u2013 we don\u2019t need anything else. Kicking off the Pyramid stage are Bj\u00f6rn Again, running through Abba\u2019s bangers. They\u2019ve just dropped Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! and it\u2019s giving me life. We\u2019re at the front of the Pyramid stage, where people are already getting in position for George Ezra, who is on at 8.15pm. Get these people some suncream and water, stat! Karin, 46; Sian, 24; Julia, 48; Pam, 66; Sophie, 36 Sian: There\u2019s three generations of us here, my mum, auntie and grandma. I\u2019ve brought them all along for their first Glastonbury and we can\u2019t wait to see Stormzy. I absolutely love him and I\u2019ve never seen him live before, so I had to be up close and personal. My gran is still to be convinced, so I had to force her to the front! Tobias: I saw George Ezra on the BBC Introducing stage here a couple of years ago and it\u2019s amazing to see him on the Pyramid now, especially for Nancy\u2019s first Glastonbury. We\u2019re not moving \u2013 we\u2019ve just got drinks with us, since we\u2019ve already had a full English brekkie. It\u2019s my third time spending all day at the front \u2013 the last time was for the Arctic Monkeys. There\u2019s just something so special about being at the front \u2013 you get on the big screen and the atmosphere is amazing. You can\u2019t get this kind of experience anywhere else. If you\u2019re not hanging out with the drag queens but are follwoing along at home instead, we\u2019ve made a guide to the best stuff to watch on the BBC who are here all weekend. (The crew have their own lockable showers, which, frankly, is galling.) Last night we were down at Block9, the \u201cnaughty corner\u201d where lots of the best late-night action happens \u2013 including some truly fabulous leather drag kings and queens at the NYC Downlow club, styled like a grimy New York meatpacking-district club. Emphasis on the meatpacking. Get down early tonight as the queues get massive. Tonight there\u2019s a brilliant lineup featuring Midland, Prosumer and Erick Morillo. There was also the unveiling of the awesome IICON stage, home to cutting-edge techno and electronic mayhem set inside a giant head. You may need to hold the hand of your most fragile friend if you happen upon this later. Morning! Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s Glastonbury liveblog. We\u2019ll be following the action on Worthy Farm all weekend long, reviewing the key gigs, but also looking at what the 200,000-odd people attending are getting up to. There will be glitter.
