Congratulations to the Netherlands, who progress to the final against Portugal. Commiserations to England, who will try to end their season on a bittersweet high by winning the third-place play-off against Switzerland. It promises to be a super Sunday as the first Nations League reaches its climax. Thanks for reading. Nighty night! Gareth Southgate\u2019s verdict. \u201cAn incredible evening, really, with the twists and turns of the match. I think we\u2019ve learned so much by playing against a top-quality team posing different problems to ones we\u2019ve played in the past. We got to grips with those issues, we had a threat throughout, but obviously we\u2019ve conceded really poor goals. At any level you can\u2019t concede those types of goals. We also had a couple of really good opportunities to score, and you have to take those chances. So it\u2019s difficult to put into complete context at the moment because there\u2019s so much going through your head. On 82 minutes, you thought you scored to put ourselves in an incredible position. But the matter that was disallowed, and the manner their second one went in, really deflated the team at a moment when their energy was running low. We have to play out better. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of stopping doing what we are doing. The Dutch pressed really well, and we weren\u2019t quite as sharp in some of our decision-making. But we\u2019ll be stronger for our experiences. We can\u2019t have too many of these high-level matches. And we\u2019ve got to give a really good account of ourselves on Sunday.\u201d Harry Kane speaks. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a massive disappointment, having been ahead at half-time. I thought we came out a little bit slow in the second half, dropped too deep, and it took them to equalise for us to step it up again. And when we did I thought we played really well. Of course we scored a goal that we thought was going to be the winner, but that\u2019s the fine margins in big games like this. It didn\u2019t go our way today. We know we made mistakes but that\u2019s part of learning as a team and we take that on the chin, because that\u2019s the way we want to play. Of course we\u2019re disappointed, but every disappointment we have to learn from and get better.\u201d Daniel Taylor was our man at the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques in Guimar\u00e3es. Here\u2019s his verdict on another night of semi-final despair for the Three Lions. Sterling makes a strong point. If you\u2019d told anyone this time last year that England would contest both the World Cup semi-finals and the Nations League semi-finals within 11 months, you\u2019d have been told to put the pipe down. But this England team are now operating at the business end of big tournaments. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do, and while tonight\u2019s defensive calamities will get all the attention, the lack of midfield control needs addressing as well. But they\u2019re heading in the right direction, and there are worse places to finish than third or fourth, right? Or maybe it\u2019s still too raw for talk like this. \u201cNot bothered anyway,\u201d sniffs Christopher Lee. \u201cStupid tinpot made-up trophy anyway. Not even bothered. YOU\u2019RE CRYING.\u201d A word with a reflective Raheem Sterling. \u201cI thought at times we soaked up pressure really well. Towards the end of the second half I thought we were the better team. But if you make silly mistakes at this level you get punished for it. VAR is one of those things. One day it might help us, but today it didn\u2019t. We\u2019re disappointed. They got their pressing right on the night, and we made a few mistakes. We tried but it didn\u2019t work. We have to keep trying. It just wasn\u2019t to be. I think we\u2019ve still made progress to get to this stage, and it\u2019s all about kicking on now, and trying to achieve the last bit.\u201d England\u2019s 53-year wait for a major final will go on. The Netherlands will play Portugal in the very first Nations League final! England face another third-place match, this time against Switzerland. 120 min: Depay nearly latches onto a loose ball down the right, but Pickford is out quickly to gather on the edge of his box. A 4-1 scoreline would have been harsh on England. 119 min: The English fans have been the noisiest for most of the evening, but now it\u2019s only the Dutch who can be heard. They give it the ol\u00e9s as the oranje ping it around. 117 min: Kane has a shot from distance. It\u2019s deflected over for a corner, from which nothing occurs. England\u2019s shoulders collectively slump. 116 min: England have been the architect of their own downfall. Depay looks to add to their misery with a shot from 30 yards, but it flies over the bar. It\u2019s not going to matter. Another Dutch goal, another English defensive fiasco. Stones, deep as can be, passes upfield to Barkley, on the edge of his box facing his own goal. A heavy touch allows Depay to scoot off with the ball down the inside-left channel. He draws Pickford, then cuts back for Promes, who lashes into the empty net. 113 min: The Netherlands make their final change. De Jong makes his way to the far side of the pitch, because he\u2019s the one being hooked. Strootman comes on in his stead, once he leaves. 112 min: Walker slings in a fine cross from the right. Kane\u2019s up in the hope of winning the header, but he\u2019s too eager and bashes into a well-positioned De Ligt. A free kick, and the clock is now England\u2019s sworn enemy. 111 min: England have to take chances now, and there are gaps at the back. Holland nearly exploit this state of affairs when Depay screams down the right, but his ball inside, with Wijnaldum free, is too strong for his team-mate. 110 min: Alli needlessly drags down De Jong, and Holland take their own sweet time to restart the match. Textbook game management, and very frustrating for England, who have no option but to suck it up. 108 min: Kane bustles around the edge of the Dutch box, then turns on a sixpence and bursts down the inside left. He nearly breaks through but De Ligt slides in at the expense of a corner. No great loss, because Henderson\u2019s delivery fails to clear the first man. 106 min: Van de Beek is booked for coming straight through the back of Barkley. And we\u2019re off again! England use up their bonus extra-time substitution, going for broke by replacing Declan Rice with Dele Alli. England needed to hear that whistle. They were going nowhere. And they need a goal desperately. 103 min: An awful lot of aimless stuff in the middle of the park. This benefits Holland much more than England, the scoreline being what it is. 101 min: A free kick for Holland out on the left. Depay fizzes it from a tight angle towards the bottom left. Pickford gathers. England counter through Sterling down the right. He\u2019s sent free but miles offside. The flag doesn\u2019t go up immediately, though, and England\u2019s fans want a penalty as De Ligt bowls Sterling over. But they\u2019re not getting it. Up goes the flag, and that\u2019s that. 99 min: Holland have their tails up. A corner on the left. Depay flashes a header goalwards at point-blank range. Pickford saves instinctively, brilliantly. Another corner, which Van Dijk meets with a header that\u2019s going into the bottom left. Kane clears off the line. What a complete farce! Maguire plays the ball back to Stones, who faffs around on the edge of his own box. He\u2019s stripped of possession by Depay, who is clear! Pickford parries the shot magnificently, but the ball breaks left. Promes is getting there ahead of both Pickford and Walker. His attempt to bundle home is going wide left, but he\u2019s knocked the ball against Walker\u2019s outstretched leg, over Pickford and in! 95 min: And so Depay takes. But he doesn\u2019t get it anywhere near the top right corner, where he was aiming, and it\u2019s an easy claim for Pickford in the middle of goal. 94 min: Stones miscontrols and then hacks De Jong to the floor. A free kick just to the left of the D. Depay fancies it. 93 min: Space for Dumfries down the right. He curls into the centre. Van de Beek winds his neck back to head. Stones gets in the road to divert the ball out for a corner. From the set piece, Van Dijk rises highest and plants a header towards the bottom right. Kane clears off the line! 91 min: Lingard is quickly scampering down the right, and gets two opportunities to cross. Neither is taken. Here we go again! England get extra time underway. The Netherlands were the better team for most of the second half, but England will take heart at their strong finish to the game. So this is going to be some 30 minutes. Holland swap Bergwijn with Propper. Extra time it is, then! It was always going to happen, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a semi-final. This is how England roll. 90 min +6: And now here he is sashaying in from the left and grazing a shot off the top of the crossbar! England yet again so close to the final! 90 min +5: England have been much improved since the equaliser, and the introduction of Henderson, who has given them better shape. Sterling has been much more involved. 90 min +4: England escape. Maguire is caught napping near the left-hand corner flag, at the edge of his own box. Bergwijn robs him and pulls back for Depay, who leans back and slices the ball high and horribly wide with the goal gaping. For a second, that looked like it. 90 min +3: Lingard dribbles hard at the Holland back line. He\u2019s got them retreating. Once he reaches the edge of the box, he opens his body and tries to guide a shot into the bottom right. It\u2019s just wide. 90 min +2: A free kick for England out on the left. Chilwell loops it towards the Dutch box. Maguire concedes a free kick by mounting Blind on the edge of the area, and there goes that pressure. 90 min +1: The first of seven added minutes - thanks to VAR - passes reasonably quietly under the circumstances. But the tension in Guimaraes is palpable. 90 min: The ball bobbles around the edge of the Dutch area. It breaks to Kane, who spins and whistles a first-time shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s just wide. Cillessen had it covered. 88 min: Phew. Say what you will about VAR, it certainly delivers drama. Both of those decisions were correct. But England were so, so close to the final there. Millimetres away. 87 min: Nope. The ball clearly hit his back, not his arm. But England still got away with one there, because the ball had broken off Chilwell to Bergwijn, who really should have scored from ten yards, but sent a poor effort off target. 86 min: And then, adding to the VAR drama, Dumfries cuts in from the right and smashes a cross into Chilwell. Could this be a handball?! 85 min: Lingard was indeed a boot offside. It\u2019s all level again. 84 min: But there\u2019s a VAR check. A suspicion that Lingard was a smidgen offside. England split Holland apart with ease! Chilwell bombs down the left and cuts inside. He passes infield for Sterling, who flicks back for Barkley. The midfielder slips an instant pass down the middle to release Lingard, who draws Cillessen and slips the ball into the bottom right! 81 min: Sterling has an opportunity to run at the Dutch defence, but inexplicably leaves the ball behind. A few players betrayed by their nerves right now. 79 min: This is a wild end-to-end affair now. Sterling nearly releases Kane down the inside-right channel, but just as the England captain shapes to shoot, De Jong slides in to block. Then Dumfries is once again found in acres on the right, but can\u2019t find a team-mate with England light at the back. A real sense, at the end of a long season, that nobody fancies extra time tonight. 78 min: It\u2019s not immediately successful, as Van de Beek is afforded a ludicrous amount of space down the middle. He slips a ball wide for Dumfries, who is free just inside the box on the right. The ball comes back to Van de Beek, ten yards out. He\u2019s got the goal at his mercy but leans back and hoicks high over the bar. What a chance! 77 min: Henderson comes on for Delph, presumably with a remit to wrest back control of the midfield. 76 min: England enjoy their first sustained period in the Dutch half for quite a while. There\u2019s some head tennis on the edge of the box, but the pressure\u2019s relieved when Kane nudges De Ligt out of the way when the player\u2019s in mid-air. 75 min: Extra time and penalties, then? This had been coming. The corner\u2019s curled towards the near post. De Ligt, at fault for England\u2019s goal, makes up for it by rising over Walker and bashing a header down and into the bottom right. Unstoppable! Pickford had no chance. 72 min: Promes is quickly into the action, and from a position 25 yards out, down the inside-left channel, he curls towards the top right. The ball\u2019s deflected out for a corner, and the set piece comes to nothing. But Holland are beginning to pin England back, and Dumfries earns another corner, out on the right, off Chilwell. 70 min: Kane is booked for an agricultural hack on Blind from behind. That was a saucy one. Another referee might have shown him a red, because he wasn\u2019t going for the ball. 69 min: An England free kick from the left is headed harmlessly wide by Stones. They\u2019ve had their chances since the restart to put this match to bed. 68 min: That double change, then. Babel and De Roon are replaced by Promes and Van de Beek. 66 min: Sterling is dispossessed in the middle of the park and suddenly Wijnaldum is wheeching towards the England box. But his eventual dig has no oomph, and Pickford can gather it easily. On the touchline, Ronald Koeman is preparing a double substitution. 64 min: Dumfries and Depay combine well down the inside-right channel, teeing up De Roon, whose shot from the edge of the box is blocked by one of his own men. A look of pure frustration spreads across De Roon\u2019s face. Holland have all of the ball, but England are holding firm. 63 min: Chilwell knocks Dumfries to the ground and concedes a free kick out on the right. The delivery of the free kick is a nonsense. For all Holland\u2019s possession and pressure, Pickford has had very little to do. 61 min: Nothing much happens at the corner. Maguire is flattened by De Roon and that\u2019s a free kick for England. Then Sancho, who had that glorious chance to make it 0-2, is replaced by Lingard. 60 min: Van Dijk, who is getting pelters from England fans every time he touches the ball, strokes a pass wide right for Dumfries. He can\u2019t get a cross away, but soon Holland earn a corner. From which ... 58 min: Holland try to establish a semblance of order by knocking the ball around the middle awhile. England are chasing shadows right now. 56 min: A real feel of Next Goal Wins. It\u2019s edge-of-the-seat stuff, with both teams giving up chances. It surely won\u2019t end with the scoreline as it is. 54 min: What a chance this was for England! Delph crosses from the left, the ball dropping onto Sancho\u2019s head, six yards out. He surely must score, but hammers his header straight at Cillessen. Then up the other end, a great chance for Holland, as Depay strips a faffing Walker of possession, races goalwards, and batters a shot straight at Pickford. He tries to meet the rebound with a spectacular bicycle kick, but takes a fresh-air swipe instead. The England fans enjoyed that one. 52 min: Bergwijn cuts in from the right, enters the England box, and runs the ball out of play. But has Chilwell clattered into him illegally? There\u2019s certainly contact, as the full back came across the front of the attacker. But the referee\u2019s not interested, and it\u2019s not so obvious that the VAR chappie is going to get involved. England might have got away with one there. 51 min: De Roon bundles Barkley to the floor, and that\u2019s a free kick for England deep in Dutch territory. Kane floats it into the box. It drops to Maguire, just to the right. He should shoot goalwards, but opts to fire it into the mixer instead. After some pinball, Holland clear. 49 min: Sterling scampers clear down the left and chips inside for Kane. Cillessen tips the cross out for a corner. But then the flag goes up for offside. That was a very tight call. 48 min: Wijnaldum drops deep and assumes the role of playmaker, spraying a pass wide right for Dumfries, who is in acres. But the ball isn\u2019t accurate and flies out for a goal kick. 47 min: A ponderous start to the half. Holland get the second half underway. And England have made a change. Marcus Rashford can\u2019t continue after taking that knock late in the first half, and Harry Kane is on in his place. And he\u2019s got the armband back as well. \u201cI\u2019ve still not forgiven England for only winning 4-1 in that match at Euro 96,\u201d admits Simon McMahon. \u201cI think they did it on purpose to ensure that heroic Scotland didn\u2019t qualify. We\u2019re still in the huff about it now actually, resulting in a 23-year self-imposed exile from the Euros. So take that, England.\u201d Half-time entertainment. And the referee blows for half-time. England haven\u2019t been particularly impressive, but Marcus Rashford took full advantage of Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s brain fade, and they\u2019re 45 minutes away from their first final in 53 years! 45 min +3: ... Stones runs under the ball, but gets away with it as De Ligt heads weakly wide left. A real chance to make up for the penalty, right at the end of the half! 45 min +2: Depay thinks he\u2019s been dragged down in the England area by Chilwell, as the pair contest a long ball, but it\u2019s not a penalty. England don\u2019t clear, though, Stones faffing around and gifting Holland possession. Wijnaldum is able to take a snapshot in a crowded box. It\u2019s deflected wide right for a corner. From which ... 45 min +1: In fact Chilwell takes the resulting free kick himself, though it\u2019s pretty aimless. The Netherlands clear their lines. 45 min: Chilwell is being checked for concussion. For a while, it doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s going to be able to continue. But with half-time beckoning ... there will be two added minutes ... he plays on. 44 min: Dumfries receives his overdue yellow card after leaping into Chilwell in a very confused manner. Chilwell\u2019s taken quite a bang there. It was a very poorly timed challenge. 42 min: From the set piece, Delph has a bash from distance. Cillessen gathers. Holland counter, and Pickford is forced to race out of his box to clear a long ball down the centre. Depay is coming in to challenge, and the two clatter into each other just outside the area. Free kick for England, though there wasn\u2019t any malicious intent from Depay. 41 min: Barkley is enjoying himself. He starts an attack deep in his own half, chipping wide right for Walker, then picks up possession again inside the centre circle. He\u2019s barged over by Wijnaldum. Free kick. 39 min: Rashford needs some attention from the physio, having taken a hard but fair knock from Dumfries. He\u2019ll be good to continue, though. 37 min: Some high-speed bagatelle in the England box ends with Depay taking a slapshot at goal. Pickford gathers, and the striker was offside anyway. Then England break upfield, and Sancho nutmegs De Ligt, who has had a torrid few minutes. Sancho then slips a ball forward for Rashford, who is about to shoot inside the Dutch box when Dumfries comes in from the side with a wonderfully timed saving tackle. It\u2019s Cillessen\u2019s turn to gather. 35 min: Babel, 25 yards out, shoots diagonally towards the bottom-left corner. Pickford saves, and gathers, though he made a meal of that. He was fortunate nobody in oranje was available to take advantage of his loose handling. 33 min: That goal came out of nowhere, with Holland having been in control. And to think it was Maguire who looked as though he\u2019d got a catastrophic mistake in him this evening. A steep learning curve for young De Ligt. After a long wait while the referee does his admin, Rashford takes the spot kick as cool as you like! He sends Cillessen to his right with the eyes, then rolls the ball into the bottom right. How cool was that? Harry Kane would have been proud of that one. 30 min: What a farce this is! De Roon passes back to De Ligt, to the left of the Dutch D. De Ligt takes his eye off the ball and lets it roll under his foot. Rashford nips in and is then upended as he races past the young defender. The referee points to the spot, and De Ligt goes into the book. 29 min: Walker channels his inner Beckenbauer and romps from his right-back position to a central position deep in Dutch territory. It\u2019s all in vain, though, because his pass wide left to Chilwell finds his man offside. 27 min: As if to illustrate that fact, Maguire takes a free kick just inside his own half and blooters it straight out of play near the corner flag. Nowhere near a team-mate. If nothing else, it\u2019s good to know he\u2019d have a future in rugby union should his football career ever go south. 25 min: De Ligt takes the ball off Stones and breezes down the right. He crosses towards nobody in particular and Pickford is able to pluck the ball from the sky without fuss. But England are second best right now. 24 min: Maguire has been very sloppy so far. Now he gets in a muddle with Chilwell, and nearly allows Dumfries to steal away with the ball. The route to the box is shut just in time. Then Bergwijn finds space down the right and loops a cross, but Babel is too far out to power a header goalwards. 23 min: So having said that, here\u2019s the first sleepy lull of the game. Pulitzer, please! 21 min: Depay dribbles hard down the left and cuts inside. He shoots towards the bottom left. Pickford is behind it all the way. England try to launch a counter, but this time Dumfries has the measure of Sancho down the left with a perfectly timed tackle. It\u2019s an entertaining match. 19 min: Chilwell turns on the jets and zips down the right. Dumfries, who has been exposed twice already by Sancho, and looks to be a weak point in the Dutch defence, cynically brings the England left-back down. He should be booked, but it\u2019s just a free kick. And the set piece is a waste of time, as Delph blocks Van Dijk on the edge of the box, releasing the pressure on Holland. 18 min: Blind is sent scampering down the left by Babel\u2019s simple pass. He reaches the byline and whips low and hard into the centre. Pickford does extremely well to get down and smother in these slippery conditions. 16 min: Holland stroke the ball about for a while. They\u2019re beginning to establish a little control. And whenever they lose the ball, their pressing game forces England into basic mistakes, and the cycle begins again. 14 min: Depay, under no pressure whatsoever in the centre circle, sprays one of the wildest passes you\u2019ll ever see high into the stand on the left. That must have been one hell of a rush of blood. Ronald Koeman stares at his striker in the ruminative style. 12 min: England get away with one. Maguire and Rice are caught snoozing just inside their own half, and allow Wijnaldum to race into the England half. It\u2019s two on one! But Wijnaldum\u2019s pass to Depay on his left is a little behind the striker, who can\u2019t check or sort his feet out. That\u2019s a huge let-off. Maguire and Rice were truly faffing around there. 10 min: Walker runs at Holland with the Dutch light at the back. He tries to slip Rashford away, threading a pass down the middle, but he overcooks it and Cillessen gathers. A promising opportunity passed up. 8 min: Now it\u2019s Maguire\u2019s turn to cough up possession. Bergwijn then dribbles down the inside-right channel, where there\u2019s a big gap in the English defence, and batters a shot straight at Pickford. It\u2019s been an open start. 7 min: A poor ball crossfield pass from Barkley is miscontrolled by Walker, who gifts Depay the chance of a shot from the edge of the box. Depay takes too long and is closed down. 5 min: Now it\u2019s Holland\u2019s turn to look nervous. Sancho again worries Dumfries, who passes back to Cillessen. He slices out of play; the throw comes to nothing. Now both keepers have got away with one. 4 min: But it\u2019s England who launch the first meaningful attack of the game. Sancho turns Dumfries this way and that as he scampers down the left wing. He dinks into the middle. Sterling nearly gets a head on it. Blind is forced to hack out for a corner. The ball\u2019s swung in from the right. Maguire volleys hard, but miles over. 2 min: But nothing comes of the resulting throw, deep in English territory. A cracking atmosphere in Guimaraes. There\u2019s a minute\u2019s silence for erstwhile Uefa bigwig Lennart Johansson ... and then the second Nations League semi-final is go! England get the match underway. Possession\u2019s given up within 12 seconds, and Holland take the opportunity of passing the ball around the back to make sure everyone gets a feel. Then they launch forward. Chilwell intercepts and passes back down the England right towards Pickford, who slices out of play. A shaky start by England. The teams are out! It\u2019s been tipping down all day in northern Portugal. The pitch is well watered. A fine opportunity for a good slide tackle. England wear their famous white shirts, Holland their equally storied oranje. The national anthems are sung: England go first, then it\u2019s the turn of the Dutch. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! England and the Netherlands haven\u2019t met each other too often in competitive matches. Marco van Basten\u2019s hat-trick saw off England at Euro 88; their current manager\u2019s free kick saw off Graham Taylor in the USA 94 qualifiers; there was a instantly forgettable goalless draw at Italia 90; and of course there was that night at Wembley in 1996. It\u2019s been a while! And now it\u2019s the turn of Ronald Koeman. \u201cIt is a big challenge. We think we have improved from the time we played England in a friendly. They are strong, they\u2019re in a good way. They have the experience of playing in a world championship, we don\u2019t have that one. But we do have great players, and the team has a good balance. We have only two players who were in the Champions League final, and I always say that if you win titles you don\u2019t feel tired, you want to flow. Virgil and Georginio wanted to play.\u201d Gareth Southgate explains his decision to keep the Liverpool and Spurs lads on the bench. \u201cWe were always of a mind that the Champions League final would be a hugely intense occasion, as well as the physical efforts. We\u2019ve had a really good group working with us for a couple of weeks, and they\u2019ve had more opportunity to focus on this game. And it gives us some real strength to come from the bench. It\u2019s never easy, but they\u2019re brilliant professionals and are always supportive of the team. They understand the rationale. Everybody\u2019s available. We want to keep developing players, we\u2019re building for next year as well as wanting to win this. Raheem Sterling\u2019s growing maturity and confidence means that the captaincy is a well-deserved honour.\u201d England rest their Liverpool and Spurs contingent in the wake of last Saturday\u2019s Champions League final. All seven - Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Harry Kane, Danny Rose, Eric Dier and Dele Alli - are on the bench. Tonight\u2019s captain Raheem Sterling will lead out a team with five changes to the side that won 5-1 in Montenegro in March as John Stones, Ben Chilwell, Fabian Delph, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford step up. By contrast, Holland go with their new European champions. Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum both start. Ajax, one second away from that final, have three representatives in Daley Blind, Matthijs de Ligt and the Barca-bound Frenkie de Jong. And up front there\u2019s a couple of old Premier League pals in Ryan Babel and Memphis Depay, the latter in the middle of a fecund creative period for club and country, having either made or scored 21 goals in his last 20 games. Netherlands: Cillessen, Dumfries, de Ligt, van Dijk, Blind, de Roon, F de Jong, Wijnaldum, Bergwijn, Depay, Babel. Subs: Vermeer, Bizot, Hateboer, Ake, Propper, Promes, van Aanholt, de Vrij, Strootman, Vilhena, L de Jong, van de Beek. England: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Chilwell, Rice, Delph, Barkley, Sancho, Rashford, Sterling. Subs: Butland, Heaton, Rose, Dier, Lingard, Henderson, Kane, Gomez, Keane, Alli, Wilson, Alexander-Arnold. Referee: Clement Turpin (France). That\u2019s much-deserved reward for Sterling, who leads his country out on his 50th international appearance. The naked eye will tell you that the Manchester City winger is a world-class act, there\u2019s no need for stats. Then again, the numbers don\u2019t hurt either: having scored just twice in his first 45 matches for England, games 46 to 49 have produced another six goals. That includes a hat-trick against the Czechs, a couple in Spain, and a satisfying goal stuffed down the throats of the Montenegro supporters giving him abuse. Throw in a domestic treble and the FWA Footballer of the Year award, and it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s on a roll. Harry Kane hasn\u2019t made it, so Raheem Sterling will captain England tonight. Full team news to follow, but here\u2019s the England starting XI: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Chilwell, Rice, Delph, Barkley, Sterling, Sancho, Rashford. Style guide. GEORGE: What is Holland? JERRY: What do you mean, \u2018what is it?\u2019 It\u2019s a country right next to Belgium. GEORGE: No, that\u2019s the Netherlands. JERRY: Holland is the Netherlands. GEORGE: Then who are the Dutch? According to the Guardian style guide, Holland \u201cshould not be used to mean the Netherlands (of which it is a region), with the exception of the Dutch football team, who are conventionally known as Holland.\u201d So there you have it. Please consider both names interchangeable for the purposes of this report. Hup Holland Hup! England have only contested five major semi-finals in their entire history. The 1966 World Cup. The 1968 European Championship. The 1990 World Cup. Euro 96. And of course the 2018 World Cup, Harry Kane, Kieran Trippier, Gareth Southgate\u2019s waistcoat, all that. Last summer seems like yesterday. You\u2019ll have noticed that their hit-rate hasn\u2019t been too clever. Just the 20 percent. They\u2019ve lost their last four semis on the bounce. Put another way, they\u2019ve not reached a final for over half a century. Oh England! But all runs have to end sometime. And since Southgate\u2019s youthful side announced itself in Russia last year, they\u2019ve gone on to prove themselves as the real deal, rescuing a slow-starting Nations League campaign with a wonderful win in Spain and a revenge victory over their World Cup conquerors Croatia. Throw in a couple of five-goal hauls against the Czech Republic and Montenegro, and England are currently on a five-game winning streak. Could that 53-year wait for another final end tonight? Perhaps, though tonight\u2019s opponents are on the upward curve themselves. Having failed to qualify for the last World Cup, the Netherlands picked themselves up, dusted themselves down, and reasserted themselves with a couple of huge Nations League wins over world champions France and old rivals Germany. Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum have been finding it hard not to score, there\u2019s a new defensive order of Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt, and everyone\u2019s tails are up again. This one\u2019s in the balance alright. Deliciously poised. Which country will make it to Sunday\u2019s final against Portugal, and get the chance to lift the second major international title in their history? The 1966 World Cup winners, or the champions of Euro 88? It\u2019ll be a blast finding out, possibly after extra time and penalties. It\u2019s on!
