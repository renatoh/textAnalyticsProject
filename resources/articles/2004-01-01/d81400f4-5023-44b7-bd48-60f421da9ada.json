The British foreign secretary was briefing MPs on Libya's pre-Christmas announcement that it would cease all programmes or ambitions to develop weapons of mass destruction. Mr Straw said it would be left for \"history to judge\" whether the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, agreed to inspections in the wake of the action taken against Saddam Hussein. But he told MPs that he had invited the country's foreign minister, Abdulrahman Shalgam, to visit London soon to discuss a range of issues including implementation of that country's decision to dismantle WMD programmes. Mr Straw said that although Libya had not developed a nuclear weapon \"it was on the way to doing so\". The foreign secretary said Libya had also provided evidence of the development of chemical weapons, potential biological weapons and missiles. \"This agreement represents a successful outcome for the engagement by the US and the UK with Libya over a long period,\" he told the Commons. \"We have, I believe, established a relationship of trust which has enabled Libya first to renounce terrorism and now to renounce the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.\" The UK now had \"corresponding responsibilities to enable Libya to come fully into the mainstream of the international community\". Mr Straw said Mr Shalgam would visit London soon to discuss a range of bilateral and international issues. \"This will form part of the process of implementing the decision by Libya to dismantle its weapons programmes.\" Mr Straw told MPs Britain would help to dismantle the weapons programmes and would assist Libya's return to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The foreign secretary said the IAEA director general, Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, led a team to Libya last week and visited a number of sites. There would be a report to the next meeting of the IAEA board of governors in March, he said. The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the Libyan statement but urged a \"healthy degree of caution\" and suggested the lifting of all sanctions should await the actual dismantling of weapons programmes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
