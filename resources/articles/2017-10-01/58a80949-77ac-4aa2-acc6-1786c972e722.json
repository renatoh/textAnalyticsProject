It\u2019s a staple of art theory classes everywhere these days, but when I ask him about it, he immediately reminds me how young he was back then. \u201cI threw a lot of things in and maybe not quite as thoughtfully as I could have,\u201d he says. At 72, the American conceptual artist is just as forthright and opinionated as he was when he was writing \u201cagitprop art theory\u201d as a self-described wunderkind \u2013 though now he is bolstered by more than 50 years of a high-profile artistic career. Frequently self-referential, concerned with language, philosophy and the nature of art itself, Kosuth\u2019s works pioneered the use of text \u2013 of words, language \u2013 as visual art. One of the key figures in the conceptual art movement of the 1960s, who rejected a conventional understanding of art in favour of focusing on the ideas behind the work, he has maintained a career as a curator and writer as his pieces have been exhibited across the world, featuring in the permanent collections of major museums with career retrospectives travelling across Europe. So Kosuth is reasonably surprised when, sitting on a metal stool at one end of a stark, whitewashed room covered in his works in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, I tell him that his art \u2013 which has not been seen much in Australia \u2013 is relatively new to me. \u201cDarling, how did you manage to avoid me all these years?\u201d he exclaims. Kosuth has a gruff manner \u2013 accentuated perhaps by the fact that he is slightly hard of hearing \u201cthis week\u201d \u2013 but he is engaging and opinionated. He is known for having high-profile connections, and when conversation turns to politics, the anecdotes begin to flow. There was the time actor Vanessa Redgrave would \u201cpound on my door and sit in my kitchen and go on and on, trying to convince me to join her revolutionary workers\u2019 party \u2013 oh mon dieu!\u201d he says, putting his head in his hands. Then there was his ancestor, Lajos Kossuth, who played a significant role in the Hungarian revolution of 1848, and who corresponded and ultimately fell out with Karl Marx. \u201cAnd gave away some thousands of hectares! My inheritance! Gave away to the Hungarian people!\u201d Kosuth laments. \u201cWhich is fine \u2013 I did fine without it, thank you very much.\u201d When it comes to art, though, he is serious: \u201cArtists make meaning; that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he says. Kosuth\u2019s own brand of meaning-making is most often represented by his most well-known work, One and Three Chairs (1965), in which a chair, a photograph of that chair, and the dictionary definition of the word \u201cchair\u201d are installed side-by-side. A Short History of My Thought, currently on show for Melbourne festival at Anna Schwartz Gallery, is perhaps the ideal entry point for a Kosuth novice. Comprising mainly neon, language-focused pieces made between the mid-1960s and a couple of years ago, the exhibition is less a retrospective than a judicious sampling of a career built on questioning the very nature of art itself. Kosuth initially supported his art practice with teaching, until it began to make enough money to sustain itself. But younger artists, he says, seem to be particularly influenced by commercialisation, unconsciously conflating artistic worth with financial value. He is scathing of those who are \u201cstupid enough\u201d to think that the answer to \u201cwho is the most expensive?\u201d can also answer the question \u201cwho is the best?\u201d \u201cThose artists at the top of the list of billionaires\u2019 [collections] are rather quite derivative artists,\u201d he says. Then: \u201cThey\u2019re friends of mine, so I won\u2019t say specific ones. But I watch this phenomenon and they cite me as their childhood hero sometimes and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d By way of explaining how stifling commercial considerations can be to art, he points across the room to where Double Reading #12 is hanging \u2013 a work comprised of a Blondie cartoon and a quote from the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz about the nature of truth. \u201cThis was a show I did in LA at Margo Leavin [Gallery]. It was a really long time ago, and traffic was terrible that night in LA and I got to my opening like, in the middle of it, and as I walked in these Hollywood lawyers that were collectors of mine came running out, saying, \u2018Joseph, did you get permission to use that [cartoon]?!\u2019 I said, \u2018No\u2019.\u201d He notes that he didn\u2019t get permission from Leibniz either, but permission was not the point. \u201cI pointed to the Blondie cartoon and said, \u2018See that? That\u2019s not my work.\u2019\u201d He points to the Leibniz quote: \u201cNot my work either. My work is the gap between. It\u2019s where the surplus meaning is created from those two. Those are just props to give me that.\u201d This concern for spaces \u2013 for \u201cthe gap between\u201d \u2013 is part of what drew him to use neon as a material in his art. \u201cI needed something with qualities that I could unpack and separate,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople were used to seeing [neon], although for other purposes than art. They were used to seeing these things lit on the wall. So I transformed them,\u201d he says. \u201cAny neon used before me was basically decorative, formalistic stuff.\u201d The concern for spaces also fuels his relationship with his audience. \u201cI expect the audience to complete the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI am initiating a conversation. While I can explain my work and can talk about it, I am sometimes reticent to do it, because people want to look at the answers in the back of the book instead of working it out themselves.\u201d There are facts, however, that underpin his art \u2013 facts that are sometimes useful to know in order for the piece to resonate. Kosuth points to a large, pink work at the end of the gallery. \u201cThat\u2019s the very last word that [philosopher Ludwig] Wittgenstein wrote as he died,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat was the word \u2018language\u2019, in German, crossed off. I mean, I was fascinated by that \u2026 it gives a human side that you don\u2019t always get from dear Ludwig.\u201d I tell Kosuth I once studied that great thinker\u2019s philosophies on language, and he nods approvingly. Kosuth curated the centennial exhibition in Wittgenstein\u2019s honour for the city of Vienna \u2013 \u201cthe philosophers were fighting over his body \u2013 it\u2019s very contentious, the Wittgenstein industry,\u201d he says. He was also invited to create a work for the side of the house Wittgenstein made for his sister, Margaret. Given his concerns about commercialisation, how should artists respond to the contemporary political moment? \u201cThere are things you can do \u2013 \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 they would call it during the Nixon era,\u201d he says. Kosuth was himself active against the Vietnam War, engaging in guerrilla-type creative activity like dropping little cards from a plane over Boston that said: \u201cif this was napalm, you\u2019d be burning\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s one thing to do that; it\u2019s another to make it part of your career portfolio.\u201d Politics is always local, he says. \u201cWe have the worst president in memory and the thing about the American president is that he\u2019s everybody\u2019s president, he impacts everybody\u2019s life, whether you have the opportunity to vote for the guy or not ... but there are always local issues that have to be dealt with.\u201d Ultimately, though, it\u2019s the role of artists to look beyond politics \u2013 beyond the temporary. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world where the two most powerful groups \u2013 the two motors of society \u2013 are on one hand businessmen and women who want to see profit at the end of the day, and on the other politicians, who want to maintain their power. Those are short-term goals, and if there\u2019s a commitment only to short-term goals, it\u2019s not good for society. \u201cThat\u2019s why the intellectuals, the artists, the writers \u2013 the intellectual workers, shall we call them \u2013 are so important. They provide the long threads in this textile of society.\u201d \u2022 A Short History of My Thought by Joseph Kosuth is showing at Anna Schwartz Gallery, Melbourne, until 5 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
