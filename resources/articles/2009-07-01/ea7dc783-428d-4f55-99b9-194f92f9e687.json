This is not some experiment to see how successful we can be over the next couple of years, and who knows where we will be after that. This is a good, sustainable business.\" That, in three sentences, encapsulates the Arsenal philosophy which Gazidis has been propounding since he became the club's chief executive in January. Arsenal, dominated now by major shareholders Danny Fiszman and Stan Kroenke after an unprecedented two years of boardroom turmoil and share dealings, espouses the virtue of being \"self-sustaining\". That means spending within its means, from the booming revenues at the Emirates, and that none of the billionaires like Kroenke, or millionaires like Fiszman, are expected to put their money into the club itself. At their board meeting today, Fiszman, Kroenke and the other Arsenal directors are expected to give a tepid response to the proposal made by Alisher Usmanov, the Russian billionaire 25% shareholder they keep a bargepole's length away, for a rights issue to raise money for the club. The suggestion is a shrewd move by Usmanov and his advisers, made immediately after the European Champions League semi-final second-leg defeat by Manchester United, in which Kieran Gibbs' cruel slip to gift United the first goal was read by many as a devastating blow to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's insistence that faith could be pinned on youth. Fans, including the Arsenal Supporters Trust, do generally cherish Arsenal's traditions and dislike the idea of being owned by a billionaire. But the manner of that elimination, coupled with the fourth place Premier League finish and the banking crisis which has wiped out, for now, the hoped-for windfall from the Highbury flats, has persuaded many that the club does, after all, need some more money. Keenly aware of the club's debts and Wenger's acknowledgement that the squad needs strengthening, the AST has said it would favour a rights issue if the balance of shareholdings could be broadly maintained, with nobody gaining more control. Gazidis, though, was guarded about the merits of a rights issue. \"I am open-minded and we have commissioned Rothschild [the merchant bank] to advise the board,\" he said. \"We have to be sure it can make a real and lasting contribution to the club.\" There are arguments the board can marshal to dismiss even this apparently benign offer from Usmanov: that money raised from a capital issue should not be spent on players, that \u00a3200m of the club's principal debt is at a very good 5.6% interest rate and the other \u00a350m would be expensive to redeem. But, fundamentally, they are likely to be wary of agreeing to a proposal they believe may be designed to give Usmanov a greater share. Gazidis repeatedly drew a distinction between Arsenal's financial self-sufficiency and the clubs reliant on billionaire owners. \"I am sure that our fans do not believe Arsenal is better served by abandoning its self-sustaining model and putting itself in the hands of owners upon whom it is dependent,\" he said. \"They want success, and our challenge is to provide it in a model that preserves the traditions and values of Arsenal football club.\" Refreshing, even inspiring, as that may be, the line Gazidis has been charged with is difficult because it seems to suggest that Arsenal have no use for extra money. He would not be drawn on the budget Wenger has this summer or whether, following the \u00a310m signing of defender Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax, the manager must sell before he can buy again. But Gazidis accepted there is not huge money to spend, and the club will go into next season with the squad largely unchanged. \"The road we have chosen is a challenging one,\" he acknowledged. \"It involves developing young players we believe can form the basis of a world-class team over the next five years. And at times along that path we have had to pay for player development through points. Certainly the team needs to turn potential into real results; they know it is time to step up.\" Next season, in short, is hugely important. If the team is seen, at crucial moments, to lack the muscle wielded by billionaire-backed clubs, patience with the constant assertions about the virtues of the Arsenal way may wear thin, even among the faithful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
