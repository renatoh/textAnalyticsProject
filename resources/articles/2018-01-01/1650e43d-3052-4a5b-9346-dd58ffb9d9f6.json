The midfielder is in his second week of training following treatment for an irregular heart rhythm that has ruled him out since September. Although Mourinho believes Carrick can be important for his side this term, he said the 36 year old was set to retire and join his staff. \u201cHe can do so when he wants,\u201d said the manager, who stated the position would be with the first team. \u201cI think to take the decision to stop playing football at the end of the season and not last week because of being injured with some problem is a good decision for the team and a good decision for him. \u201cSo we are all happy and in the end of the season I expect him to join, unless he changes his mind, but the club would be very happy for him to do that. I would be very happy also for him to do that. I think he will play again. After a few months without even training he is in his second week with the team. He can be a very important player for us.\u201d Carrick, who was appointed captain for the season by Mourinho, joined United in the summer of 2006 for \u00a318m and has won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, three League Cups and the Fifa Club World Cup. Mourinho believes Luke Shaw, who has started the last four league matches, is displaying form that puts him among the finest left-backs. He praised Shaw for improving physically, mentally and tactically. \u201cI can say that in this moment I don\u2019t see many left-backs better than Luke Shaw,\u201d Mourinho said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
