The building's been here more than 83 years - it's been the Cheerio Cafe all that time. We get lots of truck drivers and reps. We want them to be able to come in and relax. It's a home from home. We had the house built at the back 17 years ago. Living here is great because you don't have any neighbours. I look out on to open fields. The thing I love is that it's isolated. I went to the cash and carry in Peterborough recently and couldn't wait to get out. I felt trapped. When we first moved in we used to hear every car go by, but now we don't notice. In the mornings I have to be in here for about 5.30 to get things ready. We try to bake as much as we can and cook most of the meat ourselves. We open Monday to Friday 6am to 8pm. Then on Saturday it's 6am to about 3pm. We don't work Sundays any more. It was too much. We've got four children and we weren't getting any time at home. That's the reason we live so close by. We did move away five years ago. We bought a house in the village, but it wasn't working out. When you go home you're always thinking about it. It's never out of your mind. You're thinking you must order this or do that. You'll wake up in the night thinking 'Did I turn that light off?' or 'Did I turn that fryer off?'. I've even got up and come back over here to check. You're always backtracking. Sundays is the hardest to switch off. You'll sit in the house, looking out the window while you're watching telly. And you can see the cafe. You think, 'Well, this or that wants doing.' But if I come over just to check on something, I'll end up being here an hour. Fiddling. That's the only drawback. I made our Sunday dinner in the cafe kitchen last week - some steak. It was easier to do it on the cafe grill than to mess about in the house. But you can't leave the lights on too long inside, otherwise you get cars pulling up. We get a lot of regulars who have been coming for years, some of them since before I was born. You get to know them on first-name terms. Some of them remember holding my daughter when she was a baby, and she's 17 now. They're a good bunch of lads. I used to think I'd be here till we retired, but to be honest, each year it's getting harder. The road's not as busy as it used to be. Now there's a McDonald's and Burger King on nearly every roundabout from here to Norwich. It's the end of an era. It sounds daft, but to me it doesn't feel like just a business. You're keeping a tradition going. And I enjoy it. I never have a day when I don't want to do it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
