True, none of those facing lower league opposition were beaten, but Hearts and Dundee will surely have been disappointed to have registered only goalless draws against Berwick and Falkirk. Hearts, for whom goalkeeper Antti Niemi was outstanding, found Berwick's strikers, Barry Elliott and Gary Wood, a constant menace. Towards the end, Wood had a particularly good chance to put Berwick ahead, only to fire straight at Niemi with the goal at his mercy. Dundee's keeper, Marco Roccati, also gave a good account of himself against Falkirk, especially when keeping out two efforts from Mark Roberts. The most emphatic Premier League show of strength was provided, not by Rangers, but Hibernian, who crushed Clyde 6-1. The star of the show was Hibernian's German striker, Dirk Lehmann. A stand-in for the injured David Zitelli, he scored two of the goals - his first of the season - and set up two of the others. Clyde's manager, Allan Maitland, admitted: 'Our quality was not the same as Hibs's. I thought they were excellent.' Another player to score twice was Dundee United's defender, Jim Lauchlan, in the 2-0 win at Montrose. Aberdeen had some anxious moments before brushing Alloa aside 3-0. With the score at 1-0, Aberdeen's Thomas Solberg and Arild Stavrum gave the opposition cause to feel that luck was on their side by both missing penalties. But Aberdeen finally put their fans out of their misery with two goals in the last six minutes from Robbie Winters and Darren Mackie. St Johnstone striker Keigan Parker also failed to convert a spot-kick, in the goalless draw against Dunfermline. Motherwell won 2-1 at St Johnstone, despite having two men (Don Goodman and Greg Strong) sent off. Kilmarnock owed their 1-0 win over Partick to a first-half goal by veteran Ally Mitchell. Their manager, Bobby Williamson, said: 'We should have had more goals with the chances we created but you have to give Partick credit for the amount of possession they had.' Far from being intimidated by the prospect of facing Celtic strikers like Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton today, Stranraer's goalkeeper, Mark McGeown, insists that he is relishing it. 'I am looking upon it as a wonderful challenge for me,' he said. 'It will give me and the other players here a great chance to properly assess ourselves.' Last season, of course, Celtic were the victims of one of the biggest Cup shocks of all time - a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Caley. 'On the back of that result, I think the chances of our getting a win has been greatly reduced,' said McGeown. However, just in case his players are taking anything for granted, Celtic manager Martin O'Neill, deemed it necessary to stress: 'I do not think the TV people would have wanted to show this match if they did not think an upset was on the cards.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
