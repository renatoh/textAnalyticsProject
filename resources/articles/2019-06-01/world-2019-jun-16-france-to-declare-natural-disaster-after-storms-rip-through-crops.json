The flash storms, which brought hailstones as big as pingpong balls to some areas, killed two people in France and Switzerland, and injured at least 10 others. The worst-hit area, the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alps region, is at the heart of France\u2019s food production and known as the \u201corchard of France\u201d. Didier Guillaume, the agriculture minister, said the government would organise a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d and introduce emergency measures to deal with what he described as a catastrophe for farmers. \u201cEverything will be done to help. The state of natural disaster will be declared,\u201d Guillaume told French television. \u201cThe goal is that no farmers will have to shut down business.\u201d Nine French departments were put on alert at the weekend after warnings of violent storms, hail and winds. When the storms struck, they were brief but catastrophic, particularly in the Dr\u00f4me and Is\u00e8re. \u201cIt lasted 10 minutes, but 10 minutes of a hail storm \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of damage in a 10km zone in the Dr\u00f4me,\u201d the minister added. Guillaume said many farmers had lost 80-100% of their crops. He added that the state of disaster would be declared when the extent of the devastation was known in \u201ca day or two\u201d. A 51-year-old German tourist was killed on Saturday afternoon after a tree crushed her camping car at a holiday site at Tanninges in the Haute-Savoie. Storms also struck western Switzerland with winds reaching up to 110km/h, according to the national forecaster MeteoSwiss. A woman drowned in Lake Geneva when her boat sank, police said. A man in the same boat was able to swim to another vessel and fired off two flares, but by the time rescuers arrived they could not find the woman. Her body was later recovered by divers. The storm also damaged 465 boats taking part in an annual regatta on the lake. Gr\u00e9gory Chardon, a fruit grower from La Roche-de-Glun, at the centre of the storm, said most of his apricots, peaches and cherries had been destroyed. Chardon, president of the local farmer\u2019s union, said he had never before witnessed weather like it. \u201cThe damage is enormous in a wide area \u2013 cereals, greenhouses, vegetable crops as well as vines have been hit,\u201d he said. The hailstones smashed car windscreens and also damaged homes, schools and public buildings. Several trees fell on train lines and fire and emergency services struggled to deal with smashed roofs. More than 2,000 homes were without electricity on Sunday. Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thoravaldes, mayor of Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re , which was also badly hit, said: \u201cIt was apocalyptic.\u201d FranceInfo published photographs showing uprooted trees, floods and storm destruction. Videos on social networks showed the scale of the disaster. The local prefect tweeted photographs of a school with its windows smashed and of the agriculture minister meeting firefighters called in to deal with the flooding and damage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
