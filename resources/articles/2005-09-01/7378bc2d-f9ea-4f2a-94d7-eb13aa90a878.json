Like many overseas students, he found the selection process tough. Making the transition from undergraduate studies to postgraduate research is hard enough for a native speaker, but his lack of fluency in English was a bigger hurdle. Each year, half a million overseas students apply to study for a postgraduate degree in the UK, US and Ireland. Paying full fees, these students represent a significant source of income for the universities. As a result, a growing number of universities and private colleges are offering foundation or pre-masters courses. These are designed to bridge the gap between undergraduate studies and a postgraduate degree taught in English. Xindong won his place after attending a seven-month pre-masters programme at Dublin International Foundation College (DIFC), a private language and study skills school approved by the Northern Consortium of British Universities (NCUK) and all major Irish universities. IELTS (International English Language Testing System) grade 5 is the minimum entry level of English demanded by university pre-masters courses, and one of the aims of the courses is to bring language proficiency up to a level 6 or above. Students develop language skills through classroom interaction and by being part of the wider community, living among native English speakers. Xindong is now settled in his adopted city of Cork. \"It is my first time away from my country,\" he says. \"I think the life in Ireland is very good.\" At the start of the pre-masters course, he had an IELTS score of 5.0. By the time he left, he had moved up a whole grade - compatible with UK university entrance requirements for overseas students. DIFC's pre-masters course started in January with 28 students, all from China. All but five gained places on university masters courses - a success rate that pleases academic director David Thompson. \"This is our third year and we have had positive feedback about the quality of our students,\" he says. \"Our partner universities award places to our students on the basis of their performance on our pre-masters programme, as opposed to IELTS.\" In the UK, at least a dozen universities now run courses designed to cater for the needs of students from overseas regions including Russia, Japan, China, East and South Asia - among them, Heriott Watt, Salford, Leeds Metropolitan, Luton and Greenwich University, which is offering a pre-masters course for the first time this year. On top of that, private colleges are starting to enter the market, although most stick to what they do best - improving students' English language test scores. Heriott Watt prepares its overseas students for business and IT masters courses by giving them an introduction to the subject area. Soas, the School of Oriental and African Studies, part of London University, runs the UK's oldest established pre-masters course, the foundation diploma for postgraduate studies. Last year Soas prepared 80 foreign students - mostly from China, South East Asia, Iran and the former Soviet republics - for masters degrees at UK universities. Studied over an academic year, the Soas course is demanding. Students from a range of disciplines are taught by a subject specialist, with an English language teacher working alongside to review students' comprehension and written work. The course culminates in a mini dissertation prepared over four months. Sue Yates, head of the department of international foundation courses and English language studies at Soas, believes a pre-masters course should do a lot more than boost language skills. It is more about preparing students from different cultural backgrounds to succeed in the UK academic world, she says. \"We prepare them to look at a variety of sources, analyse the pros and cons, put forward their own ideas, challenge their tutors and take part in rigorous discussion.\" The results at Soas speak for themselves. The school's one-year pre-masters programme has a 90% success rate and a smattering of students go on to Oxford and Cambridge as well as prestigious institutions such as UCL, Kings, Imperial College, Durham and Warwick. But at \u00a39,000, the course fee is on a par with the full fee for a masters programme itself. Yates is unhappy at what she sees as a lack of control over the proliferation of pre-masters programmes. Some form of external validation is needed, as there is no universal recognition of the quality of such courses. \"The British Council approves language schools and there is a benchmark system for access to higher education courses for domestic students,\" says Yates. \"But so far there is no UK-wide benchmark for foundation courses for international students.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
