Barcelona beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for the first time in over a year, with a goal each for Neymar, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Lionel Messi, who has stood silently in the middle of the storm during the last seven days. They have been waiting for him to calm their nerves and on the pitch he did. Messi gave away the penalty that put victory in doubt but then scored the third that ended this game. The fans had started the night chanting his name and they ended it that way too. Tata Martino, the former Barcelona manager, used to call it the \u201cweekly crisis\u201d and after this victory there might be a temptation to borrow that line to describe this week in football and dressing-room politics. That would be a mistake but, if the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, claimed that he had called elections to \u201clessen the tension\u201d, the players did their part here, Messi especially. A week after the edifice broke, the rebuilding began and began early. Luis Enrique said the result would \u201cwithout doubt\u201d reduce the tension surrounding the club. \u201cVictories are the only thing that can calm this wave [of noise],\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as we make mistakes, the crisis will be back. That\u2019s very clear. I will concentrate on what I can control.\u201d Barcelona had the lead after 11 minutes. Coming in from the right, Messi combined with Dani Alves and raced into the area, turning the ball inside towards Su\u00e1rez on the edge of the six-yard box. Su\u00e1rez could not control the ball but it came off his thigh and ran on to Neymar to slide it in at the far post. It may not have been the way they dreamed the Messi-Su\u00e1rez-Neymar trio working but it hardly mattered: Barcelona had the lead and at least the link was working. Largely this season it has not. Besides, better combinations followed and many of them. There was a pace and incision about Barcelona that was apparent almost from the start. Eleven minutes later the combination was almost perfect. Messi played the ball up the right for Su\u00e1rez who turned swiftly inside Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez, sprinted towards the area and then clipped up a wonderful ball to the far post for Neymar, only for the Brazilian\u2019s header to bounce wide. Su\u00e1rez leapt in frustration: he had miscontrolled for Neymar\u2019s first goal and a minute after that he had been unable to finish as he raced to reach a ball that momentarily slipped from the grasp of Miguel \u00c1ngel Moy\u00e0. With only one league goal this season and the sense that he is yet to find his place within this team, the pressure has been on Su\u00e1rez. But then he got the second. As the ball was swung right, Messi reacted quickly, controlling on his chest, or perhaps his upper arm, and bombing up the right, legs whirring. He cut inside and laid the ball into the path of Su\u00e1rez for him to score. Luis Enrique punched the air and Messi turned to supporters and gestured for the noise level to rise. Which it did, of course. There was something cathartic about this. There were complaints from Atl\u00e9tico and replays suggested there was some justification in them but there was also something familiar about the genesis of the goal. Messi had spent much of the half on the right; that may not be a long-term solution and surely he will end up closer to the false No9 position from which he became the world\u2019s best player, but here it worked. He spent much of the half running at Jes\u00fas G\u00e1mez and the right-back, employed on the left for the first time, could do little to stop him. Messi was hyperactive, as Barcelona were too, and the first half here may have been their best of the season. They were quick, dynamic and determined. Miguel \u00c1ngel Moy\u00e0 had blocked one Messi shot at the near post, another faded wide and his header near the end of the half missed the target too. There were clashes too \u2013 Messi seemed to seek out one of them by way of retribution \u2013 and momentarily the game looked set to get nasty, reflecting in part Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s inability to gain a foothold. But then, suddenly, they did, 10 minutes into the second half. Again Messi and G\u00e1mez were involved but this time it was Atl\u00e9tico who benefited when, to the bafflement of Barcelona, Messi was judged to have clipped his ankle in the penalty area. Mario Mandzukic smashed in the penalty. On came Fernando Torres who has scored eight times against Barcelona. There were nerves now. Mandzukic tried to release Torres racing into space but his pass did not make it. Arda Turan produced a wonderful piece of skill to flick the ball through Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s legs. Torres\u2019s cross was pushed away by Claudio Bravo and Raul Garc\u00eda, also on as a sub, clipped his shot harmlessly into the keeper\u2019s hands when hitting it hard might have been a better option. Atl\u00e9tico were pressing but Barcelona broke. Su\u00e1rez advanced on the left and struck a long ball across the field for Messi. He brought it down and laid it off to Ivan Rakitic, running beyond him. Although Messi could not reach the pull-back, the ball rebounded back to him to sidefoot in the third. \u201cMessi! Messi! Messi!\u201d the Camp Nou chanted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
