That would echo the thinking of western intelligence, which believes that Iran has recently pursued a policy of trying to embarrass or irritate the US in an attempt to persuade Washington its best policy could be to end to its crippling campaign of economic sanctions. Sir Tom Beckett, the executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) \u2013 Middle East, said he believed Iran would first consider how to \u201cseek revenge\u201d via the network of regional proxy militias built up by Suleimani over the past 20 years. \u201cIn the first instance, attacks against US interests in Iraq and Syria and even Lebanon seem most likely,\u201d Beckett said, reflecting American concerns that nearby military bases and embassies are the most obvious initial targets, although in the past Iran and its proxies have operated as far afield as Argentina. But that is expected to be only one of a series of options likely to be considered by Tehran. Most analysts believe Iranian regime will feel it has to respond, given that Suleimani was a \u201ccult figure\u201d in the country, where grisly images purportedly of his badly wounded body are being circulated via mobile phones to inflame opinion. Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, said: \u201cThere remains a grey space, where the Iranian regime believes it can conduct limited reprisals: the most obvious is targeting shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, where it hopes it would be ambiguous enough to avoid a hostile response.\u201d Iran was involved in a string of incidents targeting oil tankers in the Gulf in spring and summer, most notably the seizure of the British-flagged Stena Impero in July, although any attempt to block the strait, through which a fifth of the world\u2019s oil flows, would, Watling said, almost certainly lead to a direct naval conflict. On Saturday, Britain said it would resume naval patrols of the Gulf, which had been suspended since November, with HMS Montrose and HMS Defender, so far the only operational UK military response to the regional crisis. Boris Johnson, returning from a holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, said the UK \u201cwill not lament\u201d Suleimani\u2019s death, but cautioned: \u201cIt is clear, however, that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d Other options available to Iran include a more potent repeat of the September attack on the Saudi Arabian oil refinery at Abqaiq, widely to believed to have been conducted via missiles coming from or near Iran, although Tehran has never admitted responsibility. That attack forced the kingdom to briefly shut down half its oil production, but a more overt action aimed at having an impact on the world economy would also bring another country into the conflict, while Iran has relatively few countries on which it can rely to act as allies. A carefully nurtured ballistic missile capability also means that Iran has the ability to strike at long range. Its Shahab 3 rockets, according to the IISS, have a range of 2,000km, enough in theory to strike Israel, widely considered to be Tehran\u2019s deterrent of last resort. Western intelligence agencies had been warning for weeks that they expected the Iran crisis to get worse. But any escalation had been expected from Tehran, not Washington, under intense pressure because of US economic sanctions and desperate to find a way to force Trump to the negotiating table. But there are limits to what the US can hope to achieve militarily. Iran is a substantial country with a population of 81 million \u2013 more than twice the 30 million living in pre-invasion Iraq in 2003 \u2013 and has an estimated 523,000 people under arms and a Russian S-300 air defence system. On some estimates an invasion could require an improbable 1.6 million troops to prevent an Iraq-style counter-insurgency, although few believe that Trump or the US are contemplating the use of ground forces. However, there there is a real anxiety that the US military may no longer be able to operate effectively in neighbouring Iraq, where it has already had to announce that anti-Isis activities have been suspended after the assassination. \u201cIn that respect, you have to wonder if this has been properly thought through,\u201d Watling warned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
