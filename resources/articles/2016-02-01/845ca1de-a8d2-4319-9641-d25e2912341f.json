Thanks and goodnight! Young midfielder linked with Liverpool, signs with different club in January only to be loaned back to the League One side he was signed from. It\u2019s Dele Alli all over again! Maddison, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract but will be loaned back to Coventry for the rest of this season, has Alex Neil, the Norwich manager, excited: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to sign James as he is a fantastic prospect who has already made a mark at Coventry at such a young age. He has real potential to develop, making this deal one we\u2019re really pleased to get over the line. James will return to on loan Coventry for the rest of the season to continue his development before joining up with us on a full-time basis in the summer.\u201d Hold on \u2026 there is one more deal to come. Norwich have signed the highly-rated midfielder James Maddison from Coventry. The 19-year-old was being watched by Liverpool, who were apparently told they had to wait until the summer. But now Maddison is off to Carrow Road. So who has had the best window? Stoke signed Giannelli Imbula for a club-record \u00a318.3m fee and that was the biggest move across Europe in this window. Everton have added some firepower with the signing of Oumar Niasse in a \u00a313.5m move. Earlier in the window Southampton did well to sign Charlie Austin for \u00a34m and also held on to their star players despite continued interest. Watford had a busy window, signing five players. Newcastle have added considerable strength but could not add a goalscorer and in the Championship Middlesbrough have brought in Jordan Rhodes and Ritchie de Laet to bolster their promotion hopes. The biggest news of all, however, on a dishwater dull deadline day was not a transfer. Pep Guardiola will become Manchester City manager in the summer after Manuel Pellegrini confirmed his exit at the end of the season. Thanks for sticking around all evening. And, more importantly, enjoy the midweek fixtures. Bye! Aston Villa had a desperate window and R\u00e9mi Garde is not very happy. Might he consider his future? They take on West Ham at Upton Park tomorrow night and there are echoes of Harry Redknapp last season. That\u2019s your lot. And there isn\u2019t even a paperwork issue to keep us going. Even Sky have conceded Saido Berahino will remain at West Brom. It\u2019s over, you can go to sleep! Three minutes to go and the good news is there are actual games to talk about tomorrow! This is kinda like counting down on New Year\u2019s Eve, a massive anti-climax. Here is Imbula in action to a soundtrack of hard dance music. He looks the part \u2013 are Stoke fans happy? Leicester\u2019s Yohan Benalouane has signed for Fiorentina on loan. And on the back of that club record transfer: Stoke have completed the signing of Giannelli Imbula from Porto for \u00a318.3m. He has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract \u2013 and that is the biggest signing of the window! Mark Hughes says: \u201cGiannelli is a good young player. He has great power, good ability on the ball and a great range of passing and there\u2019s no doubt he will add to the quality that we already have at the club.\u201d Charles N\u2019Zogbia will now be staying put at Aston Villa it seems \u2013 Sunderland have rubbished the rumours saying he was about to sign. Jay Emmanuel-Thomas has joined MK Dons on loan from QPR. Stoke should complete their \u00a318m signing of Imbula before the deadline but it still has not been confirmed. Undoubted star of this transfer window: Andy Townsend, who has made for some very good radio on 5Live this evening. No hyperbole, some good tales of old \u2013 it\u2019s been a sweet antidote to the overblown silliness to be found elsewhere. Sunderland have confirmed Jordi Gomez\u2019s temporary switch to Blackburn. Some Scottish news. Saido speaks! One deal on, two deals off. Alex McCarthy\u2019s loan to Fulham has collapsed because Crystal Palace have not been able to bring in Rob Green from QPR. Rangers have, however, left Leroy Fer go to Swansea on loan for the remainder of the campaign. An hour to go! Will there be a late move? (No) The 34-year-old right-back certainly brings a lot of experience. The last-minute transfer of this window is not quite a mouth-watering one: the rarely-spotted Charles N\u2019Zogbia is in Sunderland to finalise a move from Aston Villa. Marseille\u2019s official website on Steven Fletcher: \u201cHe will not leave you unmoved. It will not go unnoticed. Neither at the Velodrome stadium nor on other stages in France. OM has a Scotsman with an engine. Knowing the mindset of the fans, it is already good news.\u201d And as mentioned earlier, Yaya Sanogo\u2019s loan to Charlton for the rest of the campaign has been confirmed. Everton have loaned the striker Conor McAleny to Wigan until the end of the season. Here\u2019s our story on Fletcher joining Marseille And Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my will be staying at Chelsea despite interest from Leicester. More from Louise Taylor in the north-east What took you so long? After seemingly decades of endless, agonising, speculation Jordan Rhodes is finally a Smoggy, the Blackburn striker joining Middlesbrough for \u00a311m following an 11th hour volte face. And, another striker, Steven Fletcher has joined Marseille on loan until he end of the season. Yes, it is perhaps the day\u2019s oddest deal. He will, incidentally be receiving crosses from R\u00e9my Cabella and Florian Thauvin, late of Newcastle United. All praise Everton for disclosing a transfer fee! Niasse told the club website: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for me, a big dream to play in the Premier League and a big dream to play for Everton. Everton is one of the best teams in the Premier League and the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world.\u201d Dreams can come true, as Gabrielle sang in 1993. Rhodes, meanwhile, has signed a four-and-a-half year contract. That fee is undisclosed. And another! Jordan Rhodes has been confirmed as a Middlesbrough player! More to follow. Manchester United news! Nick Powell has joined Hull on loan until the end of the season. Mathieu Debuchy\u2019s loan move to Bordeaux has been completed. Watford have signed Adalberto Penaranda \u2026 from Udinese, but he has been on loan at Granada. The 18-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract. Steven Fletcher\u2019s loan move from Sunderland to Marseille has been completed. That could actually be a very good move for the Scotland striker. He is out of contract in the summer and if he impresses, the Ligue 1 club might just offer him a permanent deal. And the weather is a tad nicer in the south of France compared to Wearside. Or if he wanted to get the train, he would still have time to stop off to browse the papers and buy a cup of coffee before boarding the 8.55pm from St Pancras. He would get to Leicester at 10pm and still have an hour to spare. It\u2019s quite a simple journey and a first class ticket is \u00a386.50, probably cheaper than the cost of flying a chopper. Just on time, Sky says Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my might not be able to join Leicester on loan from Chelsea because it is too windy to fly there. Now, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but three hours remain and a coach only takes 2hrs 30min. There are three hours to go! Chelsea\u2019s Marco van Ginkel is ending his loan spell at Stoke and going on a six-month loan to PSV Eindhoven, which makes sense with Imbula close to signing for Mark Hughes\u2019 team. An email from Ian Burch in reference to Barry Fry chomping down some fried chicken. \u201cBarry Fry must wonder what all the fuss is about today. He signed 80 players during his time at Birmingham, an average of 3 signings a month. I remember his chairman David Sullivan telling a story about going to the training ground to speak to all the players. Barry called all the players in and they came running from everywhere, apparently \u201cIt was like a scene from Zulu\u201d. Still at least he didn\u2019t compare it to a scene from one of his own films. This transfer window really needs a helicopter trip and images of a flight tracker. Here is some more information on Doucour\u00e9 joining Watford but heading straight to Granada. On Sky they are discussing computer game statistics relevant to Watford\u2019s new signing, Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, including his pass completion rate of 87% this season. Does it really matter when he will be straight off to Spain to help Granada out of the La Liga relegation places? This will go down well with QPR supporters. The Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell has been quoted on Sky as saying Colin Kazim-Richards \u201cis a character\u201d. Yep. Behind the scenes at Peterborough United \u2026 Blackburn have watched Jordan Rhodes head off to the north-east this afternoon, but they are getting a player from another club in that area. Sunderland\u2019s Jordi Gomez is having a medical at Blackburn ahead of a loan move until the end of the season, and Jordan Rhodes is now at Rockliffe Park, Boro\u2019s training ground just south of Darlington and the deal \u2013 possibly closer to \u00a311m than \u00a39m \u2013 is very close to completion. The Turkey international Colin Kazim-Richards has signed for Celtic, joining from Feyenoord. QPR\u2019s Leroy Fer is reportedly on his way to Swansea, signing on loan until the end of the season. The latest on Crystal Palace, Fulham and Chelsea from our London correspondent, Dominic Fifield: Looks like the latest twist to the Palace reserve goalkeeper transfer \u201csaga\u201d is Alex McCarthy now joining Fulham on loan for three months. It would presumably signal Rob Green\u2019s arrival on a free transfer from QPR. And, on the Falcao returning to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid suggestion, it is worth pointing out Jorge Mendes is about the only person on the planet who could sort that out. An agent who has significant influence at Monaco and Atl\u00e9tico moving his client out of Chelsea. It makes sense for the Premier League club and the Ligue 1 club. Remains to be seen whether it does to Atl\u00e9tico. Watford have signed Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 from Stade Rennais. It is a four-and-a-half-year contract and while the fee is undisclosed, it is reportedly around \u00a38m and he will join the Pozzo\u2019s Spanish club Granada on loan for the rest of the season. Arsenal\u2019s Yaya Sanogo is set to end his loan at Ajax early and join Championship strugglers Charlton. We\u2019ve known about Middlesbrough\u2019s attempt to sign Jordan Rhodes for quite a while now, but Scottish football correspondent, Ewan Murray, has news of another who might end up at the Riverside Obviously not content to pursue one Scottish international, Middlesbrough are attempting to buy another: Jordan McGhee from Hearts. McGhee, who can play centre or right back, hasn\u2019t represented Scotland at full level yet but has captained the Under 21 side and featured in more than 50 first-team games for his club at the age of 19. Ipswich Town had a bid for the player thrown out by Hearts in August. James Tarkowski has finally left Brentford, joining Burnley for an undisclosed fee. The Clarets manager, Sean Dyche, told the club\u2019s official website: \u201cJames is a player I have known for a couple of seasons and I\u2019ve monitored his progress from Oldham, right the way through to now. He is at a good age and has gained a lot of experience over the last couple of seasons and I feel he can be a big part of us going forwards in the future. We want competition in all areas and we have been a little bit light in that area all season, so we feel he\u2019s a very good player and an excellent signing for the club, both now and for the future.\u201d Tarkowskihas signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Rhoys Wiggins has joined Bournemouth for a third time, having spent two loan spells at the club in 2009 and 2010. And this time it\u2019s permanent! The Welsh left-back has joined from Sheffield Wednesday, becoming Eddie Howe\u2019s fifth signing of the month. The Bournemouth goalkeeper Ryan Allsop has joined Wycombe on loan until the end of the season. QPR have confirmed the signing of Abdenasser El Khayati from Burton Albion. He of course worked with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at the League One club. Denis Cheryshev had been linked earlier in the month with a loan move to Liverpool, but he has ended up at Gary Neville\u2019s Valencia instead. Following on from Louise Taylor\u2019s recent update from Newcastle, our Merseyside correspondent adds: Brighton\u2019s Elvis Manu has joined Huddersfield on loan for 93 days. Jordan Rhodes has not yet arrived at Middlesbrough\u2019s training ground but he is understood to be one his way. One man who has made it to his new club\u2019s training ground is Giannelli Imbula. He is finalising personal terms. He had a medical over the weekend but the deal has appeared to collapse over an issue with him being loaned back to Fulham for the remainder of the season. And our very own Transfer News King, Ed Aarons has arrived at Guardian Towers. Pep Guardiola\u2019s final transfer at Bayern Munich looks like being Serdar Tasci, who has joined on loan from Spartak Moscow until the end of the season to provide defensive cover. Here is a vine of him signing his contract. And another snippet from Louise Taylor in the north-east. Looks like Newcastle are backing away from the idea of bringing their old left back Jose Enrique back to Tyneside from Liverpool. Aldershot have confirmed Alfie Pavey has extended his loan from Millwall for another month. In far more exciting news than any transfers, Football Weekly is here! Look away Aston Villa, fans. An email from Adam Griffiths \u2013 \u201cStat of the day: Cardiff, currently under a transfer embargo, have signed more players this transfer window than Villa. If Villa were a racehorse, the vet would have put them down by now. Yes, they have. Aitor Karanka has signed the 29-year-old defender on loan from Leicester until the end of the season. The Rhodes deal is close, too, and word from Teeside is that it will make it over the line. Swansea\u2019s \u00c9der has joined Lille on loan until the end of the season And this gives me an opportunity to try out my French (I\u2019ve been trying to re-teach myself having hated it in school but years later coming to the conclusion that speaking more than English and Gaelige \u2013 which is utterly pointless \u2013 might be beneficial) \u201c\u00c9der est un bon joueur, il a des qualit\u00e9s athl\u00e9tiques au-dessus de la moyenne,\u201d said the manager, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Antonetti. It translates to, I think: \u00c9der is a good player with above average athletic qualities. Alfred Finnbogason, who scored for Olympiakos against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, is close to joining the Bundesliga\u2019s Augsburg from Real Sociedad. (He was on loan with the Greek club) Norwich have signed the midfielder Ebou Adams on an 18-month deal for an undisclosed fee from Dartford. Hello. Yes, you\u2019ve had you Miller. Now it\u2019s time for Filler right up until midnight \u2013 because you can be sure there will be an hour of wondering whether paperwork has gone through or not when the window shuts at 11pm. And that\u2019s all from me. Now Alan Smith has arrived to take this transfer blog, home, home, home. Direct your correspondence to alan.smith@guardian.co.uk, or tweet @AlanSmith90 Kevin Nolan has signed Nicky Hunt at Leyton Orient, from Mansfield. Big Kev getting the old 2003 Bolton band back together - Gudni Bergsson and Mike Whitlow to follow. Small bits of news from Charlton, who have terminated the contracts of Frank Moussa and Ricardo Vaz Te, but perhaps more significantly are reportedly on the verge of signing young prospect Ademola Lookman to a new contract. Given that their business plan involves cultivating young talent then selling it on they probably don\u2019t have much hope of actually keeping him at the Valley, but at least this way they have a chance of getting some decent coin when he does go. A quick dip below the line, where doncobaino writes: Said it last week but Man United\u2019s lack of business in this window must be an indication that the board no longer trust LVG. That, or they think the squad is fine as it is.... We are largely dealing in loans out from the Premier League to the Football League at the moment, but it\u2019s all good fun, yeah? Fabio Quagliarella seems to have played for pretty much every club in Serie A - now he\u2019s going to play for one of them twice, as he\u2019s heading back to Sampdoria from Torino (with whom he is spending his second spell), initially on loan. Claudio Ranieri is hopeful of signing someone, probably a forward, before the end of the day. He know this because he said so, here: Always I am positive but now, believe me, I am very focused on the next match. There are other people involved in the negotiations. Everything is done [identifying players] and now it is their job. My job is thinking about the team. \u201cIt [the squad] is enough because my team is so strong, so it doesn\u2019t matter. If a player arrives or doesn\u2019t arrive, it\u2019s the same. If someone arrives I\u2019m happy because these kind of players can help us. That\u2019s it. I am always confident.\u201d CSKA Moscow\u2019s Ahmed Musa, Crystal Palace\u2019s Dwight Gayle and Chelsea\u2019s Lo\u00efc Remy have all been mentioned as potentials. Oh, well, this is interesting, from our boy Andy Hunter... Newcastle United are trying to re-sign Jose Enrique from Liverpool. The defender is considering a short-term deal, he\u2019s out of contract in the summer, and it\u2019s likely to be the only deal done at Anfield today if he accepts. If you can stand it, here\u2019s more on Saido Berahino, from Mark Hughes. Summary: sounds like he\u2019s going nowhere. Said Sparky: It\u2019s been mentioned that we might have been in the market for a certain West Brom player. I think it\u2019s fair to say, West Brom have been quite insistent in their message that Berahino wasn\u2019t available. \u201cWe expressed an interest and we asked to be kept informed, but they have been consistent in their message so I don\u2019t anticipate anything.\u201d Want a few details on the Seydou Doumbia to Newcastle deal? You got it, stud. Ouch... A lightly bubbling rumour throughout the day has been talk that Manchester United could be in for young Benfica midfielder Renato Sanches. Benfica, for their part, sound quite relaxed about the whole affair: \u201cRenato is mature beyond his age,\u201d Benfica manager Rui Vitoria told Sport TV. \u201cHe is being protected by a group of players who support him and are giving him a lot of help. \u201cThis situation is not difficult for us. If things happen, they happen. We all know that\u2019s the way it is. There is no point in worrying over things that have yet to happen. \u201cThere is no drama about all this. The team is very stable and that helps dealing with speculation like this.\u201d Saido Berahino missed training today at West Brom, but there\u2019s nothing sinister going on there, according to Baggies assistant Dave Kemp. Saido is just a bit sore: He\u2019s been in this morning. He\u2019s got a bit of a knock. But he\u2019s in the squad for tomorrow\u2019s game. I\u2019m expecting him to be here. The chairman deals with that side. It was awkward today, he has a dead leg he picked up on Saturday. He came out, he\u2019s a bit sore, and he\u2019s gone home. With the media around that\u2019s probably the best thing to do.\u201d Quick word from Dominic Fifield, who says there have still been no bids received by Chelsea for Lo\u00efc Remy. Surely someone should make a play for him... The Press Association now report that Saido Berahino won\u2019t be leaving West Brom today, but as far as we know Newcastle\u2019s bid of around \u00a325m - \u00a325m! - is still on the table. Busy day at Middlesbrough. More from Louise Taylor here... Julien de Sart has arrived on Teesside and is undergoing a medical ahead of a loan switch from Standard Liege until the end of the season with a view to a permanent transfer. The highly rated 21-year-old defensive midfielder is a Belgium Under-21 international. Not strictly transfer news, but Newcastle have announced that Ayoze Perez has signed a new five-and-a-half year contract at the club. Shay Given might want to leave Stoke on loan, with the European Championships in mind. Although he\u2019s not quite there yet, telling the Stoke Sentinel: I\u2019ve still got the European Championships to get right for and hopefully play some games for Stoke, but that\u2019s not going to be easy because Jack has probably been our player of the season so far. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get match fit first, which will probably take a few weeks, then take it from there. The summer is massive for me and it\u2019s important I get match fit and play a few games to show them I\u2019m ready to get on the plane to France. \u201cIt might be here or it might be on loan for a couple of months. The important thing is to make sure the knee is right and then maybe have a chat with the gaffer. So at the moment it is a bit premature to be talking about loan spells.\u201d Some afternoon reading: Paolo Bandini on how Milan were inspired by Mark Hateley to beat Inter this weekend. Sort of. Interesting... No business at Liverpool, then... More from Louise Taylor, on a player who looks like he won\u2019t be leaving Newcastle, today at least... Cheick Tiote is unlikely to leave Newcastle today but both the midfielder and the club hope he will be departing in the near future. This will be possible as the transfer window in the United Arab Emirates, China and Russia stays open a little longer than ours. Tiote has already turned down one mooted move to China and is believed to be holding out for a transfer to the UAE... Here are some details on Stoke\u2019s move for Giannelli Imbula, who in the opinion of me and plenty of other people who have watched him more and are thus much better qualified, is a good player. Here\u2019s some more stuff from Remi Garde, and it doesn\u2019t exactly paint the best picture of life at Aston Villa, even though we did rather know that would be the case already. On transfers in general: The situation of the team at the bottom of the table was not something easy to deal with for new players but it\u2019s not the only reason. It was also a financial problem but it\u2019s not my job to explain that again. Probably the club realise mistakes have been made in the past and they didn\u2019t want to do it again.\u201d On Seydou Doumbia, off to Newcastle instead of Villa: I spoke a long time with the player and I spent a lot of energy to convince him but he chose another club, that\u2019s life.\u201d And on disappointing the fans... I am disappointed because I know I represent this big club. I am not coming in front of the fans with good news. I always said I will not run away. I feel the way I am working, and the way I see the club, I feel the support.\u201d Another City kid out on loan - Enes \u00dcnal has done one to NAC Breda until the end of the season. A few nice lines from Louise Taylor on today in the north-east... Sunderland\u2019s Steven Fletcher has flown to Marseille for talks over a transfer from the Stadium of Light to the Stade Velodrome. Davide Santon has rejected a proposed return to Newcastle United on loan from Internazionale but the full back would be prepared to make a comeback if a permanent deal can be agreed. Right now though that looks a little unlikely - although Steve McClaren does need a left back. Boro and Jordan Rhodes talking again but suggestions Watford might be set to attempt an 11th hour hi-jack. West Brom sign Stuart Broad\u2019s younger brother... Just official confirmation of something we basically knew earlier... Here\u2019s a bit of reading on the new manager of Manchester City, Josep Guardiola... City youngster Bruno Zucolini has taken the news of Pellegrini\u2019s departure so badly he\u2019s left for Greece... Away from the \u2018big\u2019 story for a second, here\u2019s Andy Hunter... A fraction below Guardiola-Pellegrini on the news scale, Aiden McGeady has completed his loan move from Everton to Sheffield Wednesday until the end of the season. Here\u2019s the full story on the Manchester City/Guardiola/Pellegrini hoo-ha.... Manuel seems all magnanimous and stuff, but was it really necessary for City to announce in their statement that he was (at best) second choice for the job when they appointed him in 2013? Nick Miller back now from lunch. They had a selection of tuna pasties in the canteen, which I\u2019ve never seen before. Didn\u2019t have one, mind - I went for a roast beef sandwich. So what are you lot talking about...? Manchester City have made it official, with a statement on their website. Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalized contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become MCFC Head Coach for the 2016/17 EPL season onwards. The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012. Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the Club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation. Manuel, who is fully supportive of the decision to make this communication, is entirely focused on achieving his targets for the season ahead and retains the respect and commitment of all involved with the leadership of the Club. It\u2019s not strictly transfer deadline day related, but it\u2019s a pretty big deal: Jamie Jackson is reporting that Pep Guardiola will take over from Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City manager this summer. The mysterious Prof Danglais loves to pour cold water on a hot transfer rumour. \u201cMathieu Debuchy has gone on loan to Bordeaux, according to L\u2019\u00c9quipe\u201d says the Prof, and he\u2019s not wrong \u2013 nothing official yet, though. Speaking of Patrick Roberts \u2013 Celtic have now confirmed his arrival on loan from Manchester City. This one\u2019s an 18-month deal too, keeping the winger at Celtic Park until the summer of 2017. Roberts joined City for around \u00a311m in July, but has found first-team opportunities on the slim side. No official confirmation yet, but Louise Taylor reckons Seydou Doumbia\u2019s loan move to Newcastle has been completed. What that means for Saido Berahino remains to be seen. Hello, Niall McVeigh here, taking over from Nick who has gone to thrash out a couple of deals in the canteen. Let\u2019s start in Scotland, with Celtic on the cusp of signing Man City\u2019s Patrick Roberts and Feyenoord\u2019s Colin Kazim-Richards on loan. Elsewhere, Rangers are closing relentlessly on St. Johnstone\u2019s Michael O\u2019Halloran, and Aberdeen want to take Greg Tansey down the A96 from Inverness Caley Thistle. A couple more lines from Louise Taylor now... Berahino left West Brom training early but club say he has a knock\u2026Any deal for Gomis in doubt over Swansea striker\u2019s financial demands\u2026 And on Teesside - Jordan Rhodes is apparently on the point of doing a U-turn. Steve Gibson, Boro\u2019s owner walked away from deal to sign him from Blackburn for \u00a39m due to the striker\u2019s, apparently unrealistic, financial demands but now it seems Rhodes is ready to back down. Also leaving Spurs.... Not that they\u2019ve used him very much/at all (one League Cup appearance so far) but Spurs are leaving themselves a little light at the back, with Jan Vertonghen\u2019s injury and so forth. Guess Kevin Wimmer and Eric Dier filling in will do them for now. Here\u2019s a quick line from Dominic Fifield: Julian Speroni is likely to join Reading on loan from Crystal Palace. They\u2019ll take Rob Green from QPR until the end of the season, all being well. Here\u2019s our man Jamie Jackson on the Debuchy to Manchester United rumours... The best way to characterise this is it\u2019s not currently being killed by those who would know at Manchester United. Powell to Hull (or elsewhere) continues to be in the balance... Any Arsenal fans want to jump in here...? Serge Gnabry is heading out of Arsenal on loan, to one of two Championship clubs. But Arsene Wenger, the old tease, won\u2019t tell us which one(s). Word is those two clubs are Brighton and Charlton. Yeovil are either getting their excuses in early, or getting with the times, technologically speaking... Cardiff are cooking on loany gas today... Some more odds and ends from up north, via Louise Taylor: Boro: Aitor Karanka is desperate for a striker; either Jordan Rhodes for Ross McCormack would be ideal. Can the collapsed deal for Blackburn\u2019s Rhodes be revived or will a late agreement with Fulham for McCormack be forced through? Sunderland: Arsenal\u2019s Mathieu Debuchy, Aston Villa\u2019s Micah Richards and Swansea\u2019 Bafetimbi Gomis are on Sam Allardyce\u2019s last minute shopping list - but all appear long shots. Debuchy is the most wanted. Meanwhile Sunderland are bracing themselves for a late \u00a35m bid for Jermain Defoe from Bournemouth and could sell another striker, Steven Fletcher to Marseille. You\u2019ll like this. According to a correspondent for L\u2019Equipe in France, Manchester United are one of the teams in for Mathieu Debuchy. Just let that sink in. Word from our woman in the north-east Louise Taylor, on Newcastle who are on the verge of signing Seydou Doumbia, and also... But Newcastle\u2019s main target remains Saido Berahino and they have lodged an improved \u00a325m bid for the West Brom forward after a \u00a321m offer was rejected. West Brom\u2019s resolve that Berahino will not be sold this month - and particularly not to a relegation rival appears about to be tested. Steve McClaren\u2019s board do have a Plan B though - and Chelsea\u2019s Lo\u00efc Remy and Swansea\u2019s Bafetimbi Gomis are two strikers who remain very much on the St James\u2019 Park radar. Quick translation: Fiorentina coach Paoulo Sousa wants a defender, and he\u2019s keen on Yohan Benalouane...who we all knew was at Leicester, right...? Tim Jones takes us away from the business at hand for a second: \u201cQuestion for you, seeing as there\u2019s minimal actual transfers going on. Have you seen the new Dad\u2019s Army film? Is it any good? Based on my analysis of the trailer I\u2019m going for \u2018no its terrible\u2019.\u201d Actually I thought the trailer seemed funnier than I thought it was going to be, but I haven\u2019t seen the film. Peter Bradshaw has though, so he\u2019s rather more qualified to comment... Here\u2019s word from Mr Diogo Silva, on the emails: \u201cPortuguese sports newspaper O Jogo (traditionally accurate when it comes to Porto news) are reporting Gianelli Imbula missed practice today. He didn\u2019t play on Saturday and he\u2019s not injured, so those Stoke transfer rumours might actually be true.\u201d Oh, hello... According to ESPN, Peter Odemwingie is on his way to Marseille. And apparently they are aware he\u2019s coming. The Guardian\u2019s man on Merseyside Andy Hunter writes: Oumar Niasse is edging closer to a \u00a313.5m move to Everton. The Lokomotiv Moscow striker has arrived on Merseyside for his medical. Sky Sports News have been encouraging people to send in tales of how they\u2019re enjoying deadline day. Presenter Rachel Wyse just noted that many of their correspondents seem to be at school or college. No comment. Sounds like St Mary\u2019s is closed for business today, for the most part. Here\u2019s Ronald Koeman, speaking at his press conference earlier: Maybe one of our young players like Jack Stephens or Harrison Reed, to let them play on loan, maybe that will happen today but not other big business. \u201cWe did our job and I think if you have to do your job, or any big business, today then in my opinion you are nervous or you do not know what you have to do, because in my opinion it is a little bit late. \u201cI mentioned several times, we did our job with Charlie Austin and nobody will leave the club in January.\u201d Just a little bit more on that Danish striker Cardiff have signed, Kenneth Zohore. The Bluebirds are currently under a transfer embargo that prevents them from signing players for a fee, and paying loanees more than \u00a310,000-a-week. However, owner Vincent Tan then got creative, buying Zohore for the other club he owns, Belgian side Kortrijk, from Odense earlier today. Then he was loaned to Cardiff. Jus\u2019 like that. Andrew Vickers writes: \u201cI\u2019m sending this from my work email, a risk I\u2019m willing to take as long as you can provide good news. LVG earlier this month spoke about possibly getting in a full back to cover long term injuries of Shaw, Young, Valencia and Rojo. Any little whispers in your ear? I can\u2019t watch Borthwick-Jackson or Varela play anymore their crossing is worse than the collection of run over cats we have buried in the garden. Hoping for hope...\u201d Alas, the only word that\u2019s really doing the rounds in reference to United is word they\u2019re after Benfica child Renato Sanches, and that Nick Powell might be leaving on loan. Other than that... Want to know why players are doing one to China rather than the Major League Soccer? John Duerden has some answers there, and it\u2019s a little more expansive than \u2018they\u2019ve got loads and loads and loads of money\u2019... Stuart Pearce is on a couch at Sky Sports News, and he sits with his legs further apart than any man I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Any body language experts out there have any theories about this particular brand of manspreading? That there is perpetual full-back/midfielder Kevin Constant, who has moved from Trabzonspor to Bologna on a free. Brief line from Sky, who reckon Middlesbrough, having pulled out of the Jordan Rhodes deal, are instead keen on Ross McCormack, and are looking to snaffle Graham Dorrans from Norwich too. Oooh, now, here\u2019s juicy... Philosophical stuff here. If a rumour is whispered in the forest, etc and so on... It does sort of remind me of that film that came out a few years ago alleging McDonalds were being very naughty boys and girls, which McDs then took out a full-page advert in the paper to say \u2018Don\u2019t see this film\u2019. And everyone said \u2018What film? Oh, that film!\u2019 \u201cDebuchy [leaving on loan] is still a possibility, but at the moment it doesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d says Ars\u00e9ne Wenger, also reckoning that it\u2019s \u201899%\u2019 sure he won\u2019t be signing anyone else. \u201cIf Messi knocks on my door I won\u2019t say \u2018go back to Barcelona\u2019\u201d he japed, the football transfer equivalent of \u2018I wouldn\u2019t kick him/her out of bed for farting.\u2019 To lighten the mood a little, here\u2019s a joke I heard the other day. Pub landlord: \u201cI had that Bond villain in here the other day, he made a right mess.\u201d Pub patron: \u201cOh, Javier Bardem?\u201d Pub landlord: \u201cNo, he\u2019s allowed back in if he behaves himself.\u201d Works a bit better said out loud, that one. Got any jokes or amusing stories? Nick.Miller@theGuardian.com or @NickMiller79 is where to send \u2018em, along with any transfer stuff of course. In one of those \u2018rumour denied before I\u2019d actually heard the rumour\u2019 situations, Sky Sports reckon there\u2019s no chance of Kieran Gibbs moving on loan from Arsenal to Crystal Palace. Taking a punt from the name and guessing this is word from Denmark... The Press Association have been on the case at Newcastle, where according to them the club are \u2018are awaiting the results of medical tests on Roma striker Seydou Doumbia.\u2019 If that goes breasts up then they\u2019ve still got a bid of \u00a321m in on Saido Berahino and have yet to receive a \u2018formal\u2019 response from West Brom, while they\u2019re still keeping tabs on Lo\u00efc Remy and Bafetimbi Gomis. So, in summary, it\u2019d probably be a surprise if they didn\u2019t sign a striker at some point today. Andy Hunter is literally on fire, Ruud. Here he is with an update from t\u2019other side of Stanley Park: At Everton, Lokomotiv Moscow striker Oumar Niasse is due for a medical ahead of a potential \u00a313.5m deal - as David Hytner has revealed. Sheffield Wednesday are favourites to take Aiden McGeady on loan after the Republic of Ireland winger decided his first team prospects - and therefore European Championship prospects - would be better served in the Championship than trying to dislodge Yevhen Konoplyanka at Sevilla. Blackburn Rovers have not given up on trying to lure McGeady to Ewood Park though. Darron Gibson was also lined up for a loan move from Goodison Park for similar reasons to McGeady but, despite links with Sunderland and Aston Villa, is now expected to stay put. It\u2019s the first of the day on the blog, and it\u2019s a colossal one: Cardiff have loaned striker Kenneth Zohore from KV Kortrijk. Daniel Moore has emailed in: \u201cAre you not hearing of one of the strangest transfer rumours being batted about at the moment? It looks like Marseille are in for \u2018Super\u2019 Steven Fletcher, failing that they\u2019re looking at Peter \u2018Satnav\u2019 Odemwingie.\u201d I had heard a few whispers along those lines, but I\u2019m now perfectly prepared to credit you as a rock-solid source, Daniel. DONE DE...sort of Milan have released Nigel de Jong from his contract in Italy, leaving him free to negotiate with LA Galaxy, continuing their bid to sign players who were great in the Premier League about five years ago. Here\u2019s an update from Merseyside, via our man Andy Hunter: All quiet at Liverpool so far, and may well stay that way for the rest of the day. The move for Alex Teixeira is not officially dead but with Liverpool\u2019s valuation still far removed from the \u20ac70m that Shakhtar Donetsk are seeking, it would take a major U-turn from one of the clubs to seal a deal at this late stage. Klopp is hosting his pre-Leicester City press conference this afternoon when, on past evidence, he will confirm: \u201cI have nothing to say on this.\u201d Slaven Bilic has just been collared by Sky, and he says West Ham are done for the window, their signing of Nigerian striker Emmanuel Emenike and his studded cap the last bit of business they were going to do. Slow day at Sunderland... Oh, hang on, the deal Coates was talking about might actually be Porto midfielder Giannelli Imbula. I am all over this one. Stoke chairman Peter Coates has just been on the wireless providing a piping hot update to the situation in the Midlands. He told BBC 5Live that they\u2019re \u201ctrying to get a deal done but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d Presumably he\u2019s talking about Saido Berahino, the difficulty presumably being that he\u2019s dealing with the notoriously stubborn Jeremy Peace, who\u2019s reportedly demanding \u00a325m for the forward, plus perhaps trying to persuade the player himself that it\u2019s a step up. It clearly is, but will Berahino think it\u2019s a big enough one? Quick one from Scotland, where Colin Kazim-Richards is in Glasgow in order to sign for Celtic. He\u2019s been at Feyenoord since the summer. Here\u2019s a quick word from the Guardian\u2019s man in Manchester, Jamie Jackson: Manchester United\u2019s Nick Powell is wanted by Steve Bruce on loan at Hull City - be interesting if he goes there or anywhere as he\u2019s actually started playing recently for LvG, including as a substitute in the 3-2 defeat at Wolfsburg that knocked United out of Champions League and started the club\u2019s poorest December of its 138-year history. Well that\u2019s that one ruined. According to yer man from the Liverpool Echo, anyway... Huge if true, from Darrien Bold on the emails: \u201cI might be late to the party on this one but I\u2019ve just spotted tenacious midfielder Vinny Samways tucking into a sandwich in the window of Pret a Manger in Liverpool city centre whilst rumours of a \u00a32 million deal between Tottenham and Everton continue to do the rounds...\u201d Tottenham youngster Alex Pritchard has just rocked up at West Brom\u2019s training ground to seal a loan move to the Hawthorns. Those of you who enjoy a two plus two calculation will conclude that this means Saido Berahino is off the other way. BUT ARE THEY RIGHT? There was talk that Guilherme Siqueira could be moving to Newcastle from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, but as you can see, he\u2019s off somewhere else... Interesting one from Italy where - and you\u2019ll be surprised about this - Ravel Morrison has reportedly not settled. He\u2019s only played 53 minutes in Serie A for Lazio this season, but assorted clubs are supposedly keen on taking him on loan. Sampdoria and Torino are the teams interested in Italy, while Swansea, Bournemouth and Aston Villa are all rumoured to have an interest too. The Rumour Mill! Roll up, roll up, for the latest whiffle on Lo\u00efc Remy, Dwight Gayle, Michu, Andriy Yarmolenko and more, more, more, courtesy of your pal and mine Gregg Bakowski. Oh, in case you missed it, John Terry will be leaving Chelsea in the summer. Probably. Unless whoever their new manager will be really wants him. Here\u2019s Dominic Fifield with a reflection on the man that we\u2019ll politely call \u2018divisive\u2019. That\u2019s right. Plural. Because we\u2019re citizens of the world here at the Guardian, here are the actual times those transfer windows are carefully closed, making extra sure to fix the latch so as it doesn\u2019t swing open after a heavy gust of breeze. England - 23:00 GMT Scotland - Midnight Spain - 23:00 GMT France - 23:00 GMT Italy - 22:00 GMT Germany - 17:00 GMT tomorrow, the mavericks Watford\u2019s goal to sign about a million midfielders continues apace... Sounds like it\u2019s going to be a quiet day at Bayern Munich, despite a couple of injuries to a couple of players, namely Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng. \u201cIf the club want to sign a new player, that\u2019s their thing, not mine,\u201d Pep Guardiola said, which you can read as being pretty passive-aggressive if you\u2019re that way inclined. A quick dip below the line reveals one comment that simply reads \u2018Tusk\u2019. Can only assume that\u2019s a request for this: Now then. Will Liverpool get themselves an Alex Teixeira? Seems like a long-shot, particularly as they\u2019ll have to pay some serious \u00a3 to get him. Apparently Shakhtar Donetsk have told J\u00fcrgen\u2019s boys that they\u2019ll have to shell out the Brazilian\u2019s release clause, which stands at a whopping \u20ac70m, or \u00a353m for those of you in Blighty. Here\u2019s a quick introduction to the man himself anyway. Bit of an odd one up the north-east yesterday. Jordan Rhodes looked to be on his way to Middlesbrough for something like \u00a311m, but Boro pulled the plug late on, presumably because they baulked at paying that much for a player who\u2019s an excellent finisher but slower than coastal erosion. He\u2019d probably get them 10+ goals in the remainder of this season but they might well get promoted anyway, and Rhodes is absolutely not a Premier League striker. So if you\u2019re paying that much for a forward you want someone for the future too. Here\u2019s a move that should probably go through today: Everton are in for Lokomotiv Moscow striker Oumar Niasse, a fee of \u00a313.5m agreed. More details from David Hytner on that one, here. Sky Sports News are currently going around their reporters shivering outside assorted training grounds and stadia, desperately trying to keep themselves warm by pretending that something might happen on their respective patches. Poor whelps. At least they\u2019re largely inside the gates these days, so there\u2019s little chance of any special private alone time implements being brandished. Unless a kit man or something goes rogue. Fancy making up a rumour? Here\u2019s how. Anthony Richardson has put together an easy to follow guide that involves darts. Doesn\u2019t look like there will be much movement at West Ham, as son of David Sullivan, Jack, in his role as unofficial spokesboy for the club (weird, the world, isn\u2019t it?) has confirmed on The Internet. Sunderland have bagged Bordeaux midfielder Wahbi Khazri for a fee thought to be around \u00a39million. \u201cHe is a quick, dynamic, attacking player,\u201d quoth Large Samuel. Watford sign Suarez! But not Luis Suarez! Ho! Got you there, didn\u2019t we?!?!?!??!?! What scamps we are in transfer land! It\u2019s Mario Su\u00e1rez, the midfielder from Fiorentina who has arrived for around \u00a34million. Patrick Bamford, latterly of \u2018being ignored at both Crystal Palace and Chelsea\u2019 fame, has gone to Norwich for the remainder of the season. Let\u2019s hope that Alex Neil actually wants him and will give him a few games, eh? Let\u2019s get going with some actual news. Some, like, stuff that\u2019s already actually happened. Start as we mean to go on, eh? Last night West Ham completed a loan for Nigerian striker Emmanuel Emenike from Fenerbahce, with presumably his rather fetching cap thrown in as part of the deal. A few \u2018lines\u2019 that might dominate the day: Saido Berahino could finally leave West Brom - Tottenham are keen, for Tottenham are always keen, while Newcastle and Stoke have also been mentioned. If Newcastle don\u2019t have any joy for Berahino, Seydou Doumbia could be an alternative. Real Madrid\u2019s Denis Cheryshev looks to be on the move, with Liverpool and Sevilla the clubs supposedly keen. Tottenham\u2019s move for Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 looks to have stalled over their reluctance to let him go back to Fulham on loan for the rest of the season. Could that be revived today? Mathieu Debuchy will probably seal a loan move to Aston Villa, after hanging around for the entire window hoping that someone better will come in for him. There\u2019s talk in the Portuguese press that Manchester United are looking to do a deal for Benfica youngster Renato Sanches. And there will be more too. Stay tuned. Please. If you like. Or just go off and do something else. It\u2019s entirely up to you. Morning everyone. Just under 15 hours to go, then. For all we complain about the transfer window and deadline day having become a \u2018thing\u2019 of great drama, in which drama frequently does not actually take place, it can be pretty entertaining. So leave one\u2019s snobbery at the door as I, your host until 4pm, have done, and join in. Join Nick Miller for the latest transfer news before the window slams shut at 11pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
