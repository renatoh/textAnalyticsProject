This is Ben Doherty bringing you the main stories on Monday 6 April. Australia\u2019s death toll reaches 41 Australia\u2019s death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has reached 41, with nearly 5,800 confirmed infections. Australians aged in their 30s without risk factors are battling coronavirus in intensive care, prompting a wake-up call from health authorities. There are 96 people in intensive care, with 35 on ventilators. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Paul Kelly warned that anyone, regardless of age, could be vulnerable to the virus. \u201cThis is not just an old person\u2019s disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that can affect the whole of our population and that is why we need the whole of the population to continue to take this seriously.\u201d Kelly said it was important to note the small cohort of young people had no additional risk factors. \u201cThis is a disease which mostly is mild, but on some occasions we have seen and will continue to see people with severe disease,\u201d he said. Kelly said increased cases meant a higher chance of younger people without vulnerability contracting a serious infection. \u201cThis is a wake-up call for all of us,\u201d he said. Supermarkets like nightclubs Long lines have formed outside supermarkets after Coles, Woolworths and IGA began limiting the number of customers inside stores in a bid to allow physical distancing and keep flattening the curve of Covid-19 infections during the Easter rush. The Thursday before Easter is traditionally one of the busiest days for supermarkets, as people stock up for the weekend. However, in an attempt to avoid overcrowding, a number of Australian supermarkets have instituted \u201cone in one out\u201d policies. Shane Fitzsimmons to head \u2018Resilience NSW\u2019 Celebrated New South Wales Rural Fire Services boss Shane Fitzsimmons has made the \u201cabsolutely difficult and deeply personal\u201d decision to step down, and will instead head up a new agency aimed at ensuring the state\u2019s resilience amid major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced the establishment of Resilience NSW on Monday, saying it would ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises \u2013 \u201cbe it Covid, be it cybersecurity, be it a whole range of things we may not foreshadow\u201d. Cases could drop to zero by July The prevalence of Covid-19 in Australia could peak in mid-April and new cases reduce to almost zero by July, according to modelling by the University of Sydney. But the story doesn\u2019t end there: without widespread testing to detect asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, and a firm hold on social distancing measures that remain in place up to four weeks after the person with the last known infection has recovered, the curve will shoot back up. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the exit strategy,\u201d said Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a pandemic modelling expert and the director of the Centre for Complex Systems at Sydney University, who is leading the modelling team. \u201cIt must be based in testing.\u201d The modelling is based on 90% compliance with social distancing rules. Police-enforced lockdowns \u2018unnecessary\u2019 Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease at Australian National University Medical School writes that some of Australia\u2019s recently introduced restrictions \u201cappear more as a result of panicked political decisions rather than based on biological plausibility or evidence\u201d. \u201cSome states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months\u2019 time (our winter) might increasingly rebel against many restrictions. \u201cI hope NSW and Victoria can be persuaded to relax on their overzealous restrictions so recently and unnecessarily put in place.\u201d UK prime minister in hospital Globally, there have been 69,498 deaths from Covid-19 (at the time of publishing), and more than 1.25m confirmed infections. The British prime minister Boris Johnson has been hospitalised after showing persistent symptoms of the virus more than 10 days after announcing he had tested positive. Hydroxychloroquine rush Donald Trump said the US government had ordered 29m doses of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria for which testing for its use to treat coronavirus is still under way. The drug has potentially harmful side-effects. Personal protective gear is also being airlifted to US affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns.
