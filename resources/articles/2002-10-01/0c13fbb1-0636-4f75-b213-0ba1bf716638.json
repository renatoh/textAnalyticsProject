How do they capitalise on their mass appeal without cannibalising the success of existing products? One obvious way is to develop line extensions and new sub-brands. One of the first big brands to recognise this was Mars. In the late 1940s, when rationing was still in force, research showed that consumers were cutting up their Mars bars to make them last longer. To respond to this demand \"fun-size\" Mars bars were introduced. Others have followed the \"mini\" route to brand extension: McVities put Jaffa Cakes into packs of five for individual consumption, Toblerone have done the same sort of thing and Bailey's offer multi-packs of four \"minis\" for 18- to 44-year-old women to \"treat themselves\" more regularly. In essence this strategy is all about selling and reveals a truth about new product development which is that old product development is often more likely to succeed. In fact, new products have a much lower success rate than variations of old ones. So today we can buy a Mars King Size bar, ice cream, drink or the recently launched Mars mousse, all of which carry the brand name and values that consumers know will guarantee them a quality product. Similarly, Heinz branched out from its core tomato ketchup franchise by successfully introducing special green, orange and purple tomato ketchups. Now they have followed this with a permanent range of four flavoured sauces for youngsters - Heinz Eazy Squirt. In addition, brand extension can be less risky than creating a new brand and can generate faster consumer trial and sales. It is less likely than traditional line extensions to cannibalise sales of original brands and can be one way in which the brand is kept modern and alive. However, it is possible to create new product categories which can carve out significant shares within existing sectors. For example, sales of premium packaged alcoholic spirits have soared as brand owners exploit the heritage of their traditional spirit brands - many of which have been in long-term decline - and reinterpret them for a younger adult market in the shape of variants such as Smirnoff Ice, Bacardi Breezer and Gordon's Edge. Brand extension allows brands to penetrate all types of consuming occasions - whether it be a chocolate bar at home, on the run, in the lunchbox or to share with friends. Certain categories are ripe for brand extensions and figure among the largest percentage of buying households. With almost 100% penetration, the top 10 list includes: breads and baked goods (look what Hovis has achieved with its radical re-packaging and advertising); fresh produce; paper products; fresh meat and poultry; snacks; cheese; condiments; gravies and sauces; sweets; milk and carbonated drinks. That said, it is important to get the product fit right as there is the risk of diluting the brand's image or equity. Above all, the additional offering needs to be relevant to the consumer and add value to the core brand. Bringing new users to the brand is one of the benefits of extending it but it is important that existing customers are not disenfranchised. The name of Heinz's latest innovation, Eazy Squirt, trades on the house name and describes the ergonomically designed packaging, which is often a key element in a new product, as Toilet Duck demonstrated so well. The bottles are moulded for two little hands (it is aimed at six- to 10-year-olds) to be able to turn the bottle on its head and draw on their food with the thin, easy-to-open nozzle. Like tailor-made packaging, \"playing\" with food is not a new concept either. Brands such as Kinder Surprise - with a gift inside a chocolate egg - or Cheese Strings - which allow children to \"peel\" their cheese stick - are well established in this market. While advertising and promotions can influence a consumer to try a new product, if they don't like it, they won't come back for more. Consumers have the power to vote for their favourite brands with their wallets every day, and only if the brand extension is a good fit with the parent product and continues to earn the trust of the consumer will it survive and prosper. \u00b7 Hamish Pringle is director general of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
