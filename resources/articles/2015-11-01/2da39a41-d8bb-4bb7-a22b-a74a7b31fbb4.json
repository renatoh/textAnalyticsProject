When the fog came down it looked as if it was deepening. But the fog did not get worse after the first 15 minutes of the second half and the referee [Germany\u2019s Felix Brych] saw fit to keep the game going. I\u2019d like to thank the referee. I might have a gripe about one or two decisions but I thought he was outstanding and I haven\u2019t said that for a long time.\u201d The Bosnia manager, Mehmed Bazdarevic, said \u201cI can only comment on the first half because in the second I could hardly see anything\u201d but, in fairness, he did not blame the poor visibility for the result, saying instead that \u201cwe did not manage to make life difficult for our opponents\u201d. Robbie Brady struck Ireland\u2019s goal in the 82nd minute before Eden Dzeko drew the hosts level three minutes later, but the away goal means the Irish have an edge going into Monday\u2019s return leg in Dublin, where Bosnia must score at least once. O\u2019Neill says there is no question of his team resting on such a precarious advantage. \u201cBosnia are capable of scoring so I don\u2019t think we can just sit back. We will try to attack more than we did here and play to win, that will be our objective.\u201d Ireland will be bolstered by the return of Jon Walters and John O\u2019Shea, both of whom missed the first leg through suspension, and Shane Long may have regained fitness by Monday, too. O\u2019Neill also draws confidence from the latest display of his team\u2019s battling qualities, praising how they navigated their way through the difficult assignment in Zenica. \u201cWe might be lacking certain things but in terms of desire and wanting to go out and compete, that sort of performance tonight epitomised that. We coped with the very fine players that Bosnia have in their team.\u201d He said he was especially pleased with the central defensive duo of Richard Keogh and Ciaran Clark. \u201cI thought they were really excellent. They had a very tough job all evening against top-quality players and they were outstanding for us. Clark was absolutely rock solid and Keogh had a very strong game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
