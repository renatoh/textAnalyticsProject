Four Labour MPs joined Conservatives and Lib Dems to block a government change to the libel system. The detail is complex, but worth following. Just as yesterday's welcome court of appeal ruling in favour of the science writer Simon Singh exposed the rottenness of the libel laws, so this week's spat at Westminster showed how hard it will be to reform them. Put together, the two episodes make a powerful case for the wholesale rewriting of the system, rather than the incremental adjustment so far preferred by the government. As things stand, Britain's libel system has turned into a lawyers' bonanza, suppressing legitimate debate and \u2013 in Mr Singh's case \u2013 scientific inquiry, while failing to deliver affordable justice to people who feel their reputations have been damaged. Report after report has agreed on the problem, including one from the United Nations committee on human rights in 2008 which warned that the law \"served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest\". Last year a second report from English Pen and Index on Censorship proposed some excellent solutions. But as yesterday's court battle showed, journalism is continuing to suffer while we wait for them to be implemented. Lord Judge's magnificent ruling yesterday summed up the problem: \"[An] opinion may be mistaken, but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to invite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth\". Jack Straw, the justice secretary, has, to his credit, accepted the importance of reform. Last month he said he wanted to crack down on so-called libel tourism, which has left many foreign litigants suing in British courts. A justice department working group also proposed a new public interest defence for pieces written in good faith \u2013 which would have helped Mr Singh. But much bigger changes are needed. The burden of innocence should be reversed, so that litigants have to show why the journalism they object to is factually wrong. In the meantime, Mr Straw is trying to help make the best of a bad system by reducing the number and expense of no-win-no-fee cases, which now make up a majority of actions. He has proposed a change to secondary legislation which would cut the bonus that law firms can make by winning cases from the current maximum of 100% to just 10%. This would do nothing to fix the wider failings of the law. But it might make it harder for people to bring speculative actions, and so do something to increase the freedom of the press. As such, Mr Straw's changes should be welcomed and it is to be hoped that they are passed on Tuesday, when he is due to bring them back to parliament a second time. But the rebel MPs who disagreed with his plans are not quite as boneheaded as it might seem at first glance. They say they too want libel reform, but believe that reducing the number of no-win-no-fee cases would prevent the poor from getting access to justice. They could point out, for instance, that Mr Singh's defence was funded under the current arrangement. But note that some of those objecting are not poor at all: the former Speaker Lord Martin, no friend of the press, stirred into action last week to denounce the changes. Opponents of Mr Straw's reform would have a stronger case if they could show \u2013 as they have not \u2013 that a 10% cap would do anything other than cut the cost of justice. They are right that the far bigger problem is a badly skewed law, and not the funding mechanism used to bring cases. But while Britain's antiquated libel system remains in place, all efforts to restrain its operation immediately should be supported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
