The latest assessment for the opening of the central section has ruled out late 2020 and the aim is for Crossrail to open \u201cas soon as practically possible in 2021\u201d, the capital\u2019s transport authority said. TfL had previously said the Elizabeth line, as the service will be called, was unlikely to start running before 2021 but had kept an autumn 2020 opening in its plans. The admission means that key direct services such as from Canary Wharf to Heathrow airport will almost certainly not run until at least 2022. The latest delay was caused by the need for more time to develop signalling software and to get safety approvals for the railway. The cost forecast for the central section of the line has risen to about \u00a315.36bn \u2013 \u00a3400m more than the funding committed under a financing package agreed with the government. \u201cFurther modelling scenarios\u201d suggest higher levels of risk to the project that would cost an extra \u00a3650m, TfL said. Crossrail is Britain\u2019s biggest infrastructure project in decades. The total cost was previously estimated at \u00a317.6bn but has risen to as much as \u00a318.25bn, from an initial budget of \u00a314.8bn. TfL said it had agreed with the Department for Transport that the financing package would stay in place and was talking to the department about how to cover the extra costs. \u201cTfL has been advised by Crossrail Ltd that their latest assessment is that the opening of the central section will not occur in 2020, which was the first part of the previously declared opening window,\u201d TfL said. \u201cThe Elizabeth line will open as soon as practically possible in 2021.\u201d Crossrail was due to open in December 2018 but has been beset by delays and rising costs. The National Audit Office has blamed the debacle on management clinging to an unrealistic opening date instead of dealing with problems that appeared as early as 2015. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to complete the Elizabeth line as quickly as we can but there are no shortcuts to delivering this hugely complex railway. The Elizabeth line must be completed to the highest safety and quality standards.\u201d Changes to design and schedules increased costs on most of the project\u2019s 36 main contracts. The costs of civil engineering works at Whitechapel station alone, as of December 2018, were \u00a3659m \u2013 six times the amount originally budgeted and more than double the estimate in 2015. London politicians and business groups reacted with dismay. Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat assembly member, said it was \u201cappalling news for Londoners\u201d and said both the mayor and the transport secretary had failed to hold Crossrail to account. She said the delay would also \u201cput back further investment in London\u2019s transport network and create further havoc to TfL\u2019s finances. This also damages the hopes of Crossrail 2 getting started in the next decade.\u201d Business group London First said it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Its chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: \u201cEfforts must be redoubled to ensure that the railway opens as soon as practically possible and that we learn the lessons for future projects.\u201d Crossrail is on track for one impending milestone, with the full western branch out to Reading from Paddington due to come into service under TfL Rail on 15 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
