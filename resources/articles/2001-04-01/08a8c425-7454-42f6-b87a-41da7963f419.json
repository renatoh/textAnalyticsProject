The arrangement increases the sponsorship package from \u00a33m to \u00a34m a season and, together with a \u00a3315m, three-year television deal, which begins next season, will help raise central payments to the 72 Football League clubs to an all-time high for 2001-02. First Division teams will receive around \u00a33m, up from approximately \u00a3750,000 this season. Payments to Second Division sides will go up from roughly \u00a3400,000 to around \u00a3750,000 and Third Division clubs can expect a figure close to \u00a3450,000 instead of around \u00a3200,000 at present. The television agreement, concluded last summer with ONdigital and ITV, brings First Division games back to terrestrial television. For the next three seasons ITV will have 15 Sundays of live action and will also broadcast the First Division play-off final. \"The return of our games to free-to-air television further strengthened the package we were able to offer to meet the strategic objectives of Nationwide,\" said the League's chief executive David Burns. \"We are looking forward to three very successful years together and hopefully many more after that.\" Nationwide will continue to sponsor the league's monthly awards, the man-of-the-match awards for live games and the fair play league, as well as maintaining the \"season of promise\" scheme, which provides each club with \u00a310,000 to help disadvantaged and minority groups attend matches. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
