With David Cameron and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looking on, Cavendish had to be helped over the line several minutes after the German Marcel Kittel had won the sprint finish. X-rays later revealed he had not broken any bones but had suffered a separated shoulder. While the 29-year-old desperately hopes to be on the start line for Sunday's second stage from York to Leeds, surviving the three weeks of the Tour could prove too much even for such a renowned fighter. Earlier, 230,000 people gathered in Leeds city centre to watch the riders set off for Harewood House, the official start of the race, where leading contenders \u2013 including Britain's Chris Froome and his main rival, the Spaniard Alberto Contador \u2013 were introduced to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. A brass band played both national anthems and the Red Arrows flew overhead, puffing out a tricolore of red, white and blue smoke. Then, after organisers presented William and Kate with a \"maillot jaune\" for their son George, she cut the cord to mark the ceremonial start. Along the 118-mile route the riders passed llamas painted red and white polka dots in Reeth, sheep dyed yellow in Kettlewell, and even a giant bike built out of cheese in Wensleydale \u2013 illustrations of what Gary Verity, the chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, described as the county's \"quirky sense of humour and fun\". When the Tour de France last came to Britain in 2007, it was estimated to have brought \u00a388m of economic benefits to the south-east. Yorkshire, which brought the race to England for \u00a327m, hopes it will lead to in excess of \u00a3100m in benefits as well as highlighting the county's stunning scenery to the world. Verity also hailed \"incredible and truly unprecedented success\" and claimed it was up there with the biggest crowds the Tour experiences every year. \"The crowd numbers on some of the climbs today were as big as those on the Pyrenees and some gendarmarie said the crowds in Leeds felt like a finish in Paris,\" he added. \"It's been an incredibly day for Yorkshire and the Tour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
