Arrington notes that: \"Mayer announced that their Chrome browser would shortly be leaving beta and that Google Search Wiki would soon have a toggle button to allow people to turn it off.\" The former will be interesting, since its security might be tested. (It might still be beta code, but PC makers don't like bundling beta software.) The latter is a Very Good Thing since Google Search Wiki looks like another of Google's crappy half-baked experiments. No one actually uses it, do they? Our PDA blog has more on Chrome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
