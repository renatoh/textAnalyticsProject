In the US, reviewers have been raving about it: \"The Wii is a fun, engaging, wildly innovative game console that's dramatically different from the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 - and dramatically more affordable,\" commented Jim Louderback, editor of PC Magazine. The combination of its surprising wireless controller and a troupe of games that fall outside the normal gaming fare (driving, shooting) and instead are more like those which a whole demographic is used to: physical movement. Of course, Nintendo, presently a distant third in the console race, is making the most of this, earmarking $200m (\u00a3105m) for a marketing campaign that aims to wrest sales away from Americans who were thinking of getting an Xbox 360 (now that it's a year old, and bedded down) or a PS3 (which is shiny and new, but comparatively very pricey). In fact, the PS3 - with its cutting-edge processor and cutting-edge Blu-ray player, contributing to its bleeding-edge price in the US of $500 - might be the victim of Sony's unwillingness to compromise on components. An analysis at curmudgeongamer.com in May found that the PS3's $500 price is historically high for a console. At the time, the Wii's price wasn't announced, but the $250 cost puts it squarely in the range where it looks historically cheap. There are obvious objections: the PS3 and the Wii are going after different markets; the Wii is limited because Nintendo can't command the publishers that Sony can; Sony has the might of its corporate empire, including records and films, to make the PS3 and Blu-ray into a success despite everything that has held it back, including multiple delays and the completely separate $249m cost of recalling and replacing millions of faulty batteries used in many manufacturers' laptop computers worldwide. But the Wii is going after a new market - the family - in a way that the Xbox and PlayStation haven't. The gonintendo site (hardly, let's agree, unbiased) carried one post from a blogger who took a Wii to a family do and left with four orders to get one that weekend. Sony might not like it, but swishing controllers might be the next big thing in games. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
