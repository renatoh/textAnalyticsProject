However, just as important is the way government contracts out. Hi-tech, innovative companies often have a significant development overhead, limited cash resources and management capacity. These companies do not have the resources just to be in the game demanded by the contracts. For such contracts to be viable, the risk transfer regime must be significantly reduced from the levels expected of major businesses; this includes assumed liabilities and payment terms. Finally, contracts must be relatively straightforward. Otherwise lawyers fees balloon and huge amounts of time is absorbed in endless negotiations on contracts that may never be awarded. Michael Ter-Berg London \u00b7 Members of the Open Source Consortium, a trade body representing smaller UK IT companies specialising in open source software, are successful in the private sector but less so in the public sector. One of our proposals is to enforce open standards. That would make it easier for smaller companies to get involved and should reduce costs. Iain Roberts Chief executive, OSC \u00b7 Michael Cross has highlighted vital issues. The current system, which effectively locks out all but the largest IT firms when it comes to bidding for work - particularly in the public sector - is not in the best interests of the economy. This policy largely stems from risk avoidance. The government's record on delivering IT projects is sketchy at best, so it wishes to mitigate risk by turning to trusted suppliers. However, to say it is doing nothing for the future of the UK IT industry is misleading. The Department for Trade and Industry is one body supporting the development of an IT Supplier Standard. It aims to provide a quality mark for small to medium-sized IT companies, which will prove to purchasers that the supplier can be trusted to deliver. Because no such IT industry standard exists, larger purchasers equate reliability with size. The development of a reliable supplier standard will help purchasers recognise they can get expertise from smaller, more cost-effective suppliers. Vaughan Shayler Director, ICT Supplier Standard, National Computing Centre Usability top requirement I think the main issue to be addressed with ticket machines (Technobile, June 29) is basic usability before more flexibility. We have a painfully slow new machine at our local station. The computer is slow - it pauses inexplicably between screens and ambles along. The purchase path to a ticket has many unnecessary steps. The card terminal is placed at such a height and angle that it is impossible to see the screen without stooping. Then it has one more dramatic pause before printing the ticket. With improvements to hardware and so on the process could take about a third of the time. Chris Wilcox London Window of opportunity As long as folks run Windows, viruses and spyware will run rampant. And as long as pests persist, security firms have a business model. The more Microsoft pushes the security business, the more people will wonder why the company is selling security protection for their operating systems. If everyone ran Linux or OS X, security firms would have something to worry about. http://tinyurl.com/g2h7v Technothriller adventure Rainbows End is a mind-blowing work of science fiction: it touches on the future of fandom, consensus reality, copyright, DRM, scholarship, generation gaps, and global politics, while telling a technothriller adventure story. www.boingboing.net Time waster I mostly agree with Charles Arthur (Technobile, June 22). For the most part, voicemail wastes more time than it saves because it is used inefficiently, not because it is inherently inefficient. monotoknee.wordpress.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
