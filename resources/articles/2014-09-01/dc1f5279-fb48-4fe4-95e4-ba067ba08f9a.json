Both of those opinions might appear counterintuitive, given Roach split acrimoniously with Khan in 2012 and it is in the trainer\u2019s interest for Mayweather to keep winning and looking good. The reason is it is his own fighter, Manny Pacquiao, who people most want to see in a ring with Mayweather \u2013 even though that putative mega-bout has already been seriously diminished because of continued wrangling for several years. As Mayweather and Pacquiao edge towards retirement \u2013 the American next September, the Filipino in 2016, when he plans to run for his country\u2019s senate \u2013 every nuance takes on significance. And, as much as Mayweather has been trying to sell his rematch with Marcos Maidana here on Saturday night as the only fight that matters to him, he has not lost sight of the endgame; he still wants Pacquiao, but on his terms. He was adamant Bob Arum\u2019s claims (along with those of Pacquiao) that negotiations are more promising than ever are \u201cflat out not true\u201d. Perhaps, but the talks definitely are not dead. Roach\u2019s observations are searingly relevant to Mayweather\u2019s immediate task, a fight the world welterweight champion might have imagined would be a soft option to Khan after outpointing him here last May. \u201cI\u2019m convinced his legs are shot,\u201d Roach told the Guardian. \u201cLook at the first four rounds of the first [Maidana] fight. Great fighters in later years often go to the ropes as they slow down, but he got into trouble there. He was under a lot of pressure. Mayweather at his best would never fight like that.\u201d Especially against an opponent who admits he is no Sugar Ray Leonard, and who begged Mayweather this week: \u201cDon\u2019t run like a bitch, stand and fight.\u201d As for Khan, who survived a Maidana late onslaught to outpoint the Argentinian four years ago, Roach says: \u201cIt is his speed that would be the difference. He\u2019s just too fast for Mayweather.\u201d Khan claimed on Thursday night, incidentally, that the prime minister was helping him get a visa to make a last-minute trip to Vegas after the fighter had his original successful application reversed. It may not be at the top of David Cameron\u2019s priorities, mind, given he is busy trying to save the union and monitoring the biggest terrorist threat the UK has seen in years. Mayweather undoubtedly has trained with his usual dedication but he looks out of sorts, distracted and tetchy. And, if ever he needed a clear mind, it is at the end of a fortnight in which his partner of eight years, Shantel Jackson, has entered the headlines with details of her civil suit against him for alleged domestic abuse. Mayweather compounded that problem by seeming to defend Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens running back suspended for knocking out his then fianc\u00e9e, who is now his wife. It has been obvious for some time, and was confirmed in bursts of indiscretion this week, that Mayweather\u2019s intelligence resides almost exclusively in his fists and feet. While his boxing brain should be enough to secure his unbeaten record, his walking-around, people brain is malfunctioning. At their final press conference, Leonard Ellerbe, the chief executive of Mayweather Promotions, called out \u201cthe haters\u201d and made a bizarre plea for the media to stop writing about Mayweather and Rice. \u201cHe\u2019s become the face of boxing and often he is the guy who wears the target on his back,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what he says, what he does, people gonna have an opinion. But the hating has got to stop. What other athlete in sports can you say has dominated everyone in front of him for so many years? We must find a way to acknowledge greatness when we see it. There will never be another fighter like him.\u201d At that very moment, a Mayweather tweet appeared on smart phones around the room: \u201cAcknowledge greatness when you see it.\u201d The fighter and his chief executive, at least, are talking the same language. When Mayweather spoke it was softly, as he has done since serving 90 days for domestic abuse of another former partner, Josie Harris, in 2012. As for his earlier comments on Rice, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t condone what happened. If I offended anyone, I apologise. I have this tough, rugged fighter in front of me and that\u2019s what I have to focus on. I\u2019m not perfect, I make mistakes and I don\u2019t condone that at all.\u201d He does have one tough customer in front of him, although it is difficult to accept Mayweather\u2019s contention that \u201che absolutely deserves this rematch\u201d. Mayweather is closer to the truth when he says: \u201cI need a knockout and I\u2019m going for it. I need it to make a statement. First for myself, I want to do it for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
