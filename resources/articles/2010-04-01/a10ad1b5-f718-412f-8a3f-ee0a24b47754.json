You can take them easily, but often the order in which you take them is as important as the tricks. As you take them, your opponents must discard. Let them exchange the minimum of information. Say the suit divides 3-2 \u2013 one opponent must make two discards and his partner one. You must force the player who discards twice to do so before he sees his partner's discard. See today's deal from rubber bridge. Game all, dealer North. West led the \u2665Q, and we had overbid as usual; unless the \u2666 suit could be brought in for four tricks, the contract had no chance. Winning the \u2665 lead with the ace, I played a \u2663 to dummy's king and East's ace. Naturally he returned a \u2665, and I played the rest of the \u2663 suit like this: first the jack and then the eight. If West had followed suit I would have overtaken the eight with the 10 to lead the fourth round through the East hand before West could make an informative discard. But when West discarded on the eight, I let it hold before leading the fourth round from my hand. Clearly West could not afford to discard one of his winning \u2665 \u2013 if he did, I would have time to set up an extra \u2666 trick. His correct defence was to throw two \u2660, coming down to the singleton king, but this was hard for him to see. When, hoping that I had started with 3=3=3=4 distribution, he discarded a \u2666, that suit did play for four tricks even though fate had not intended that it should. I told you it was tricky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
