Even a man of Redknapp's assurance is entitled to lapse into the odd moment of self-doubt when, between them, the Football Association, Fabio Capello and that little piece of elasticated black cloth formerly located on John Terry's upper arm have left such a rare form of chaos. No manager, no captain. No order, no system. No Wayne Rooney for the first two games and nothing more than the vague outline of a starting XI for the opening match against a France side who have suffered their own self-inflicted wounds but now, compared to England, resemble a beacon of stability. The first game of Euro 2012, between Poland and Greece, kicks off in 100 days and no other team in the competition are operating with this kind of confusion. Nowhere else is there the sense they are making it up as they go along. This is why it is surely time for the FA to restore some kind of decorum, decide what it is going to do and then actually go through with it without any more delay. It has had meetings, made background checks, worked out the numbers. If it is Redknapp the FA wants, the call needs to be made to Daniel Levy to try to extract the Spurs manager in a way, if possible, that does not trample all over their season. If it is someone else \u2013 then fine, but let us recognise that the longer this carries on the harder the governing body is making it for the next man. Sir Trevor Brooking, one of the four executives deciding Capello's successor, may think that a new manager \"could be parachuted in a few days before\" the European Championship starts but, surely, the FA would not be so reckless. The uncertainty is doing nobody any good. Vast expanses of seats were left empty for Wednesday's game at Wembley, at which there was little of the feelgood vibe that usually starts to build in the months preceding a major tournament. Right now, it is very difficult to find even scraps of optimism, just a sense of resignation and bewilderment. Whatever Brooking says, the fairest thing would be to afford the next manager as much time as possible when, contrary to the popular impression, his most important job will not actually be deciding whether Scott Parker should continue as captain when it may cause offence to Steven Gerrard. A central defensive partnership needs to be put in place. A replacement for Rooney has to be established and, quite frankly, there does not look as if there is one. Jack Wilshere has not played all season. Gerrard lasted only 32 minutes against Holland and had not previously turned out for England since November 2010. More than anything, the Terry issue is not going to go away. Redknapp, for example, would almost certainly want to bring Rio Ferdinand back, but he would need to find out pretty quickly about the extent of the politics and whether Terry's partnership with the Manchester United player can be restored when their relationship is close to being broken. A peace agreement needs to be found given what happened when the squad met for the November friendlies against Spain and Sweden and some of the black players were distant from Terry, to say the least. These are all issues that need time and care. In the meantime, Stuart Pearce needs to be thanked for his work and politely ushered back to the Under-21s. He has generally spoken well over the past few weeks and done everything that might have been expected of him. Yet his latest pitch for the job was peculiar given that, in one sentence, Pearce talked about having the experience of major tournaments to be in charge for Euro 2012 and, in the next, he said he would be too inexperienced at the end of the competition to take over on a long-term basis. It did not really make sense, but the bottom line anyway is that Pearce's record in management is far too modest when the FA has not just spoken about Redknapp but discussed whether it should put in exploratory calls to Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. The real issue is, three months before the tournament starts, that this should be a time when the team lineup is virtually decided, give or take the odd position and an injury here or there. Instead what we have is a side that look like they need a full pre-season. All England have are two friendlies, against Norway in Oslo and Belgium at Wembley, and then the action in Group D starts. Sweden won 3-1 in Croatia on Wednesday. Ukraine, the co-hosts, also had an away win, 3-2 in Israel. Perhaps most ominously, France went to Germany, beat them 2-1 and are undefeated in 18 matches stretching over a year and a half. The FA really needs to get on with it now and show its hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
