His early cover-drives became one of the delights of the series and the No3 position could now be his for years. \"I never realised how good a player he really was,\" said Peter Moores. Jimmy Anderson The leading wicket-taker on either side, despite having to open against Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, and quicker than he has been for a while. Has responded to the challenge of spearheading England superbly: four of his seven performances were world-class. \"Jimmy has grown quickly,\" said Moores. Paul Collingwood Inventive as a captain, innovative as a batsman, nagging as a bowler, electric as a fielder. The first two are the most surprising, but he has led with foresight and skill, and scored his 274 runs at virtually one a ball. The players have lapped up his consensual approach, which tallies perfectly with the philosophy of Moores. Three cons Matt Prior Was given the chance to get England off to flyers, but failed to reach 50 and hit only 15 fours and one six in seven innings. In 22 ODIs, he averages only 21, and if his keeping got better as the series progressed, it might be time for England to think about dropping him down the order. Monty Panesar His economy-rate of 4.78 wasn't bad, although he tended to bowl once the fielding restrictions had been lifted. The Northamptonshire left-arm spinner should be aiming for more than a wicket a game. His tendency to bowl more quickly after being hit for four betrayed his anxiety about a form of the game he is still coming to terms with. Alastair Cook Started with a bang at the Rose Bowl but wilted so badly against the wiles of the left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan that he was dropped for Lord's. He should come again, but by the end of the series England's biggest headache was their opening partnership. Lawrence Booth"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
