But since the introduction of CDs, record companies have treated customers like fools ripe for a mugging rather than valued purchasers. Until internet retailers and supermarkets began to redress the balance, UK customers were overcharged compared with European and US customers. There are also regular but ham-fisted attempts to copy-protect CDs, which stops buyers from legitimately copying them for compilations or on to portable MP3 players. Worst of all is the practice of issuing a \"new\" version of a recent CD with bonus tracks or a DVD. This is a slap in the face to the fans of an artist who buys new CDs on initial release, thereby being the first to repay the record company's precious investment. Record companies need to stop trying to occupy a moral high ground which they have no right to, and concentrate on releasing attractive products at realistic prices, rather than tricking us into overpaying for music we already own. Jerry Green Cranage, Cheshire The industry repeats the mantra that file-sharing damages sales, though the evidence is not conclusive. It fails to recognise that file-sharing is here to stay and will become quicker and easier. What is required is a system of licensing that recognises the importance of musicians and music to society and encourages a wider distributive arc. Consumers have a central role to play in this democratising process, to destroy this developing perspective would be the really immoral act.
