London may see itself as one of the culinary capitals of the world but it has just two restaurants in the top 50 \u2013 the same number as Moscow \u2013 and both within a few hundred metres of each other. The number of British restaurants in the top 50 halved from last year, when the capital could also boast of having the best female chef, in Clare Smyth at Core, in west London. Over the same period, Moscow, which has been undergoing a food renaissance, saw its tally double. At a glitzy ceremony in Singapore on Tuesday, Lyle\u2019s, on Shoreditch High Street, was announced the 33rd best restaurant in the world and the Clove Club, on Old Street, came 27th. Not only are they a stone\u2019s throw away from each other, but their chefs, James Lowe and Isaac McHale, respectively, used to work together at the Young Turks, also in east London. Adam Coghlan, the editor of Eater London, said the principles of the list had been criticised in the past for being \u201clargely Eurocentric, largely male\u201d and favouring expensive tasting-menu restaurants. But it also aspired to recognise innovation, and by that criterion the only London restaurant he was surprised not to see on the list was Ikoyi, which offers a modern take on West African cuisine in St James\u2019s Market. He said: \u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t say much about how good London restaurants are. It probably is a fair reflection of where London ranks in that field: an extremely narrow brand of innovative fine dining. That of course is only one way to measure how good a food city London is. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the two restaurants now among the 50 best are in Shoreditch. I think that says something about a shift in the style of cooking now recognised as \u2018world class\u2019. These restaurants are decidedly modern and have moved British fine dining away from its traditional French roots. \u201cBut also, it illustrates how trends and money has geographically shifted east. It\u2019s interesting that previous mainstays in the 50 best were the Ledbury and Dinner By Heston Blumenthal, both in west London.\u201d He said despite the chefs connections and their proximity, they were very different, reflecting their previous experience, Lowe at St John and McHale at the Ledbury. Votes were submitted by more than 1,000 international food writers, critics, chefs, restaurateurs and industry experts from around the world. Lyle\u2019s and the Clove Club both climbed the list from last year, up five and six places respectively. The experts\u2019 choice for the top spot was Mirazur, the three Michelin-starred restaurant of Mauro Colagreco in Menton on the French Riviera, France\u2019s first winner. It took the top spot from Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, which was no longer eligible after the introduction of a new rule barring previous winners from the list. Colagreco, the first non-French three Michelin-starred chef in the 110-year history of the guide, said the award was a great honour, coming from his peers. He said: \u201cIt recognises the trajectory of my life from Argentina to the Riviera that welcomed me so warmly 19 years ago. I am overjoyed to bring this award back to France.\u201d In second place was Noma, in Copenhagen, considered one of the most influential restaurants of the past decade. Despite being named the world\u2019s best restaurant four times previously, it still qualified because it has reopened in a new venue with a new menu. It tweeted that it was \u201csuper happy\u201d about the result. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 June 2019 to make clear that a reference to Ikoyi related to the world list\u2019s effort to include innovative establishments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
