In the blue and purple one: art. These were the stereotypes assigned to the protagonists in Catalonia as Chelsea turned to their strong men to negate Barcelona's sky-lighting brilliance. John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba would dispute this narrow designation, but there was honour in strength and stubbornness. Call it larceny, if you will, but all Chelsea will say is that they stopped the Barcelona goal machine to take a 0\u20130 draw back to Stamford Bridge. Quite how they did it while seeing less of the ball than vampires see of daylight is a subject only the Camp Nou congregation will dwell on. Some thought Barcelona's creativity was an inextinguishable light that would blind Guus Hiddink's men. Now they must transport that radiance to London to complete a much tougher job. Chelsea's midfield might has scrambled many a mind. Before last year's Champions League final, Sir Alex Ferguson acknowledged the bulldozing power of Lampard and the Michaels, Ballack and Essien. At Wembley this spring, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left out Andrey Arshavin and Samir Nasri in an FA Cup semi-final in favour of a more muscular starting XI. Few conquer Chelsea toe-to-toe. To load up the testosterone here, Hiddink omitted the firefly Salomon Kalou in favour of an extra central midfielder, Mikel John Obi, to compress and frustrate Bar\u00e7a's \"Three Amigos\". \"Big clashes between big players\" was Hiddink's battle cry. But Chelsea never set out to make this an orchestral collision. To call it a strategic triumph would be to flatter the Premier League's representatives. What made the stalemate possible, in the end, was Barcelona's failure to convert possession into goals. It was not that Chelsea stopped them creating chances: more that the finest gang of assassins in club football fumbled all their weapons. The point still holds, though, that Hiddink has restored this team's unity and sense of mission. Take Drogba. When the Dutchman took temporary charge, the Big D was like a limp puppet suddenly enlivened by 10,000 volts. The switch in his psyche is not hard to locate. You do what Jose Mourinho did: first, pick him automatically, then tell him what a warrior he is, how doomed you and the team would be without him. With Nicolas Anelka and Kalou on the bench, and Florent Malouda playing deeper to assist the makeshift left-back, Jose Bosingwa, Drogba was cast as the brave frontiersman, battling Bar\u00e7a's central defenders alone. A quarter of an hour in, after five minutes of ominous Barcelona pressure, he tried to flick on a Petr Cech goal-kick with his head and threw his arms about tetchily when he saw that no midfielder had joined him in support. But there were sound reasons for their circumspection. Chelsea's tactic was the midfield swarm and the frantic defensive block. Had they seen any less of the ball in the first half they might have bought a packet of nuts and joined us in the stands to spectate. Mikel was especially profligate: a reflection, probably, of Hiddink's recent loss of faith in him, and the elevation of Ballack to a starting role. It is a truism of elite sport that conviction cannot be switched on and off. Mikel's temporary boss had promised not to resort to roughhouse methods to thwart Bar\u00e7a's gift for geometry, but under duress his players frequently found themselves swinging a boot at the recently departed. Bosingwa, who had the advantage of being able to deploy his right foot whenever Messi cut inside, was the first to cut down the world's most exciting player. Alex was the first to be booked for chopping him down. Did you win the sweepstake? Then Ballack went into the book for upending Thierry Henry, who has escaped the dump of players prematurely condemned as geriatric. Seven minutes before the interval, Drogba exploited a defensive error by Rafael M\u00e1rquez but drove his shot at V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. It was Chelsea's first meaningful attack of the night. Moments earlier, Drogba had served up one of those comedy sketches that only he thinks he can get away with. When Daniel Alves hit the deck and stayed there, the great Ivorian thespian remonstrated with him on the ground, and tried to yank him back up, as if to feign discomfort were an offence against human nature. Hiddink's half-time message must have been that Chelsea were pushing their luck too far. Sooner or later one of those Bar\u00e7a chances would fly in. More ambition, more precision was required, and soon Ballack was heading just over from a Drogba free-kick. Containment is not a 90-minute option. Sooner or later you have to give the other mob something to think about, to stop them regarding you as foil for their creativity. Barcelona's' reputation preceded them, that much is clear. The blizzard of goals, the new Dream Team rhetoric, penetrated Chelsea's thinking. But it gave new life to the tenacity and obduracy Mourinho had imbued. John Terry, especially, enjoyed this test of his manhood, until Eto'o eluded him 20 minutes into the second half and almost scored. By now Chelsea were back to playing without the ball. Soon they were functioning without Lampard too, as Juliano Belletti came on to pile a few more sandbags. Power intimidates, but not as much as artistry. Here was a team built to entertain sharing a result with one set up to endure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
