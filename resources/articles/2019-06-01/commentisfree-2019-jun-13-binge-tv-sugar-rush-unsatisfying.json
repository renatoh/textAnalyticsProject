All in one gulp or paced out slowly in weekly increments? This week a Radio Times survey suggested that the latter method is falling out of fashion, with 80% of respondents suggesting that they\u2019d lost sleep binge-watching a programme, and more than half claiming to have watched more than eight hours of a show in one sitting. Yet how satisfying is binge-watching really? Yes, there\u2019s something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away, but it\u2019s also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want (at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up) is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV \u2013 and not necessarily for the better. Take, for example, the conversation around spoilers. It\u2019s no coincidence that this has only intensified in the era of binge TV, when people no longer have any clear idea of when they can start discussing a major twist. Worse, binge-watching encourages us to put our individual viewing experience centre stage, positioning it as equal to, if not more important than, the programme being watched. This means that we\u2019re enraged when someone quicker off the mark discusses a show before we\u2019re ready, leading to bitter arguments that would have been avoided if everyone was watching at the same time. And it\u2019s not just spoiler etiquette that\u2019s affected. The worst thing about binge-watching isn\u2019t the online fury or the fear of missing out or even the sneaky lying to your family about how many episodes you\u2019ve really watched. It\u2019s that it denies viewers the pleasure that a truly communal TV experience brings. That sense of television as a communal rather than an individual experience is the reason why the year\u2019s most talked about shows \u2013 Game of Thrones, Line of Duty and Fleabag \u2013 have been those that aired weekly, forcing audiences to wait. Being made to wait seven days for each new episode of Game of Thrones is the reason why even the smallest plot points were analysed and debated and why viewers became so creative with memes and gifs. Similarly, if Line of Duty had been binge-watched, no one would have had time to concoct elaborate theories about OCGs and UCOs, while watching Fleabag back-to-back would have entirely lessened the cultural impact of the Hot Priest, a man whose appeal (or lack thereof) was driven by the fact that fans were feverishly discussing it every week. Of course a version of those conversations might still have happened if those shows had been available to watch all at once but they wouldn\u2019t have dominated popular discourse in quite the same way. Not convinced? Then consider the example of The Last Kingdom. When it aired weekly on BBC Two, the travails of Uhtred, son of Uhtred were readily available to chew over in bite-sized chunks. The excellent third series has been on Netflix since last November but any discussion was over almost before it had truly begun. Similarly, Deutschland 83 was one of Channel 4\u2019s biggest hits when it aired weekly. Deutschland 86, the sequel, barely caused a ripple after being released in its entirety on Walter Presents via All 4 earlier this year. The very nature of binge-watching means that the conversation becomes fragmented and, while it\u2019s wonderful to find your tribe, those people who are obsessing over Call My Agent or the select (but clearly correct) few who have tracked down the second series of Harlots, it\u2019s hard to top the rush of knowing we\u2019re all watching the same thing at (roughly) the same point in time. At this point, committed bingers are no doubt shaking their heads in despair at my old-fashioned and out-of-touch ways. I understand. Truly, I do. It\u2019s nice to have the power and the freedom to watch something at your own speed, to finish something when and as you want. But it\u2019s nice too to have the space to think about what you\u2019ve watched, to mull over what just happened while waiting for the next episode to air and to feel part of a wider moment (even if your biggest contribution is to say \u201cwhy on earth is everyone watching this crap?\u201d). At its best, television has always been a two-way conversation between creators and viewers, stuffed full of tasty morsels to discuss. The trouble with binge-watching is that it turns that over-stuffed banquet into a superficially filling but ultimately unsatisfying meal for one. \u2022 Sarah Hughes writes on TV and the arts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
