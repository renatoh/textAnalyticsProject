I agree with that. But at least, in the case of Rachel Wagstaff's stage version of Faulks's celebrated 1993 novel, it is a very good sculpture that captures something of the unimaginable horror, as well as the fractured comradeship, of the first world war. The weakest part of the play is the first third which deals with the sojourn of a young Englishman, Stephen Wraysford, in the Amiens of 1910. As a working guest in the house of a rich manufacturer, he falls in love with his host's wife, Isabelle: an experience that colours his whole life. But, although we see the affair through Stephen's eyes, this feels like filleted Faulks. The industrial unrest that provides a context to the affair is cursorily dealt with. Even the anguish of the cuckolded husband, who in the book rushes from room to room seeking evidence of tainted bedsheets, is reduced to a single cry of jealous rage. But when the play moves to the western front, from 1916 to 1918, it exerts an emotional grip. Wagstaff has jettisoned the later stages of the novel in which Stephen's grand-daughter seeks the truth about the war. What this version focuses on is Stephen's transformation from an ardent lover into a figure of despairing isolation in the face of endless human sacrifice. Refusing leave and rebelling against what he calls a mechanical abattoir, he cries, on the eve of the battle of the Somme, \"some crime against nature is about to be committed.\" And the roll-call of the dead that unspools on the front-cloth after the battle itself is as moving as anything in the evening. But although Trevor Nunn's production faithfully gives us a sense of the horror of war, it also follows Faulks in conveying moments of spiritual generosity. The key figure in this regard is the working-class sapper Jack Firebrace, superbly played by Lee Ross, who learns by letter of the loss of his son to diphtheria. At the moment he receives the news, Jack is about to sketch a loved comrade; and, even when he hears of his son's death, his natural instinct is to help a young private who exists in a permanent state of confused terror. It is the existence of goodness in a living hell that gives the story its power. The play is also staged with simple ingenuity. John Napier's designs, based on projected drawings and photographs, effectively usher us from the watery charm of peacetime Amiens to the scarred emptiness of the wartime landscape. And the performances throughout are good. Ben Barnes conveys the essential loneliness of Stephen kept in ignorance of the child he has fathered. Genevieve O'Reilly as his lost lover, Zoe Waites as her consoling sister and Nicholas Farrell as a pipe-smoking, Thucydides-reading captain also invest their roles with the right weight. This is not the whole of Faulks's book; nor can it be. But, in the space of three hours, it gives us an effective summation of the story and captures both the pain and the pity of a war that almost defies comprehension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
