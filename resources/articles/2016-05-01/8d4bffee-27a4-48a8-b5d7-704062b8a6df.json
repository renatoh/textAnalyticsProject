Whatever he claims, Perry\u2019s great gift is to be at ease anywhere. An outsider to the art world by virtue of his class, an outsider to most other demographics by virtue of his transvestism, he is securely and unchangingly himself: a fixed point from which he can view all comers. Allied to a quick mind, compassionate spirit and unending curiosity, it makes him the perfect interviewer in any situation. So far, every documentary he has done has been one to treasure, and All Man is shaping up as no exception. \u201cI think every fighter has an untold story,\u201d says Andy, one of the most feared and brutal cagefighters. His is that he and his brother grew up in care. His brother was everything to him, and one day he killed himself. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never, ever, ever told anyone that. I\u2019m broken inside, I know I am. If it wasn\u2019t for fighting, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Perry also met Thelma, mother of 30-year-old Daniel, who has already left. He died by his own hand 18 months ago. \u201cThe coroner said there had been 14 that month,\u201d said his mother, rage merging with grief. \u201cFourteen! It\u2019s an epidemic.\u201d She was right. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45. Eighty per cent of people who kill themselves are men. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think men even know they\u2019re sad,\u201d said Perry. \u201cReally?\u201d said Thelma, with surprise and a kind of awful hope in her voice. Their stories played out against the backdrop of the annual Durham Miners\u2019 Gala, which celebrates the region\u2019s history and mourns its losses. Perry, with his customary deft touch, teased out the connections between an old model of masculinity \u2013 the clearcut role as breadwinner, the satisfaction of hard labour, the freedom to be \u201csoft\u201d when you wanted because you proved your strength and your worth inarguably, day after day, hewing your pride out of the coalface \u2013 and how it malfunctions in the modern world. Watching one of the martial arts fights (\u201cIt calms you down,\u201d says one contestant), Perry sees \u201chard labour reinvented as leisure spectacle\u201d and \u201ca need to search for the heroic narrative\u201d that is currently falling short. He distils his experiences into a tapestry banner based on those carried in the miners\u2019 gala and blessed in the cathedral, and makes one of his famous pots covered in images that caught his eye and imagination. One was of the tattoo of Daniel his friend had done (\u201cNobody wants to be seen as less of a man,\u201d his pal said, \u201cbut if he\u2019d have said \u2026 I\u2019d have been there in a heartbeat\u201d), and other testimonies to wordless grief and despair were wreathed around. Thelma cried when she saw it, and thanked Perry for making it. We didn\u2019t see Daniel\u2019s dad, or Andy again, in the programme. Not for them, perhaps, even the small consolation of art. There are seven episodes to go before The Good Wife (More4) finishes FOR EVER, and so I suppose it was inevitable that Elsbeth would make an appearance. Her popularity confounds me, given not only the fact that she is intensely irritating in her own right, but also that she seems to have wandered in every time from a completely different show. She helped Eli to investigate the FBI investigation against Peter before \u2013 mercifully \u2013 realising she was conflicted and drafting in her dog-cradling ex-husband to help instead. He is marginally less irritating, and works out that the FBI are \u2013 you know what? Nobody cares because Alicia and Jason are at last getting round to DOING IT. It interrupts a courageous storyline (because this week Alicia is working for the Pentagon, apparently) about whether a US-born Isis recruiter is entitled to due process before being labelled an enemy combatant, but let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s what we came here to see. It must be good, because Alicia\u2019s hair goes slightly wavy and \u2013 I have looked ahead \u2013 stays slightly wavy for at least another two episodes. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is clearly better at sex than he is at being Negan in The Walking Dead, but we will discuss that massive anticlimax another time. Seven. Just seven episodes to go. I miss it already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
