He's such a handful, it just wouldn't be fair on the other passengers. We always fly him from the States in our own private jet.' Note the use of 'our' as opposed to 'a'. Check that one out. As I wander through the cocktail party, chilled glass of champers in hand, I catch other conversations. A camp German man dressed from head to foot in scarlet, with the biggest gold medallion this side of Miami is saying: 'When Cliff was last staying at our villa with us...' Welcome to Barbados. Probably the most decadent island on earth. On what other island would you find such a high concentration of facelifts at one casual cocktail party on a Sunday night? Or so many restaurants with caviar and champagne menus longer than the entr\u00e9es? Or any other beach served by Concorde? British Airways has now resumed regular services on its two main routes: last month New York (the obvious choice because of all the business travellers who need to get there), but as of last weekend, Barbados, the Concorde route we don't hear so much about. Barbados missed her last winter. Restaurants closed, locals were laid off from hotels and chauffeurs polished their cars. BA had been forced to suspend services to NY and Barbados after the Air France Concorde crash outside Paris last July. Without her, many Concordesetters went elsewhere for their winter tans. As one of 54 passengers on the inaugural flight last weekend, I stepped off Concorde at 9.50am Barbados time (having left a grey rainswept Heathrow at 9.30am). The island's Tourism Minister ran up the stairwell and grabbed the mike to welcome us. A bright red thick carpet awaited us incongruously in the dazzling morning sunlight below where a line of dignitaries hovered. A throng of schoolchildren waved and handed us flowers under a banner proclaiming 'Barbados welcomes Concorde back' while TV camera crews jostled for the best shot. Of what? Some ashen passengers clomping down the stairs, blinking in our winter coats. Islanders are delighted at the business Concorde brings back. But what about the noise, I asked? 'It's gone in 40 seconds and it's only once a week,' said our taxi driver. With return flight tickets from the UK costing around \u00a36,000, every landing spills out up to 70 high spenders (the jet can hold 100, but limits numbers to 70 for Barbados because holidaymakers take more luggage than NY business travellers). Despite recession and safety fears, the appetite for Concorde is strong - helped by a special offer fare of \u00a32,999 return launched for a limited period last month. It's not all lottery winners and nouveaux riches. Many are the 'once-in-a-lifetimers' who want to 'do' Concorde for their wedding anniversary/sixtieth birthday/retirement present or marriage pep. The waiting list to get on Concorde to Barbados for Christmas is so long that BA has put on an extra flight on 24 December. You can see how people get hooked. Sitting back in the \u00a37,000 ink-blue leather seats with 'cradle mechanism' (invented by Factory Design, colours chosen by Conran), this is flying with a difference. We are 11 miles above earth, on the edge of space. If you look up you can see it - all black and mysterious. On a clear day (i.e. not today) you can see the curvature of the earth below. Cheery flight attendants pour endless bottles of Dom Perignon down passengers' necks. The menu is outrageously extravagant - lobster, truffles and caviar galore (and yes, even here the cutlery is plas tic following 11 September). No discomfort is permitted. The lemon that comes with the smoked salmon has gauze sewn on so the pips (heavens above!) don't drop in your fish. One supposes that holidaymakers doing the three hours and 50-minute skip from Heathrow to Barbados (that's half normal flying time) want to get their money's worth. Remember, it is almost \u00a31,000 an hour. The captain tells me that on the NY flight, where many passengers' employers are paying, most people are on laptops and orange juice. There's a buzz in the air. Not only is Concorde back, but Sandy Lane, the famed hangout of the stars, has fully reopened this winter for the first time in four years. The hotel had begun to show its age, and rather than do a superficial tart-up, the new Irish owners who followed the Fortes shocked locals and regulars by bulldozing and rebuilding the whole thing. In the shiny marble lobby I spot Rory Bremner with his baby; Sven was here recently and so many stars are coming for Christmas (Nigella and Saatchi, Michael Winner, Mel C) the nerves of the staff are palpable. No, there aren't any footballers and their wives here right now (the season is on), but it's that type of place. I wonder why anyone with \u00a3500 plus per night to spend would want to come to a place like this? But considering there are normally as many tabloid snappers as stars here in December, it's a sure way to get some free publicity to promote your new book, TV series or album. This isn't a place to hide, rather to get your ego stroked. Before you arrive (via a silver Bentley Special 4.2 litre edition year 2000 with white leather interior), the driver phones ahead with the champagne signal ('We'll be arriving in eight minutes,' he mutters). There's a welcoming committee. One holds a silver tray with an ice cold glass of champagne, another holds a tray with an ice cold wet towel and another holds a silver tray on which to deposit the towel. We inspect one of the regular suites (\u00a31,714 per night high season). Having spent a rumoured US$400 million on the place, it doesn't come cheap. It's jammed full of mock columns, mahogany furniture, marble floors and the latest technology. If you're a celeb there can't be much to do here except watch other celebs (and play with your remote controls). If you go for a dip, a 'champion' (as the management lingo for staff goes) nips over to your sunglasses and polishes them and if you leave one page of your bonkbuster turned down, another 'champion' will rush up with a Sandy Lane bookmarker and insert it. Anyway, we could go on. Or better, go elsewhere, leaving Southfork-on-Sea behind. We drive past Cilla's apartment down the beach, spot the restaurant where Tamara always goes and have a turn on the catamaran where we spot Robbie Williams and Mel C's signatures in the visitors book from last January. We stop at the Lone Star restaurant for lunch, a former petrol station with four designer rooms for rent. Michael Winner stayed here the Christmas before last, splitting his time between this and another hotel down the beach where he had also booked into a room. 'We got pretty used to him once we'd worked out what he wanted,' says Lone Star manager Rory Rodger. And what was that? A typewriter, jelly for dessert ('Green, yellow and orange, please,' he said when asked which flavour) and fresh squeezed orange juice. He's already faxed the hotel to book the restaurant on 10 separate nights this month. So where do you go to hide from Winner? Villa Nova, which opened eight months ago, on the east side of the island, is a 40-minute drive but a million light years from these west coast antics. The property, owned by British author Lynne Pemberton, is a hideaway. Formerly the home of British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden, this 1830s inland sugar cane plantation house with 28 rooms has one of the most wonderful gardens in Barbados. No jet skis, no It Girls. Just the constant hum of birds singing, frogs croaking and crickets clicking.Don Mayers, who has worked here for 27 years and is one of 10 gardeners, shows me around the 15-acre garden pointing out the best bits: aloe vera, spiral ginger, Christmas candles and Barbados mahogany trees. What's that palm tree there? 'That's what we call Politician Palm Trees, because they're tall, crooked, always have their spurs out and produce nothing,' he says. I look towards the pool to see if there are any live ones. But no, the guests look like the type of people who read the news, rather than make it. If you want to be by the sea, you can drive through the sugar cane fields 10 minutes to Cattlewash Beach where Villa Nova rents a small wooden house on the beach. Unlike the west coast, the beach is wild, overgrown, with big surf, rock pools and no people. You can walk for hours. All yours. Not a Burberry bikini in sight. Let's pray that Robbie, Mel and Michael don't find it.
