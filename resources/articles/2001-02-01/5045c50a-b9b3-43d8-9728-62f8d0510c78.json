Four draws in the last four league games may not be the stuff of dreams. But considering that three of those have been away from home and in view of the failings of the sides below them, the tally is a satisfactory one. At this rate Middlesbrough are bang on course for the 40-points safety net. The toast of Teesside has now steered them to 12 unbeaten matches - with a whiff of FA Cup success thrown in - and there is sure to be an extra sparkle in his Manager of the Month champagne. Had substitute Phil Stamp earned the penalty that Steve Stone's late challenge seemed to merit, it could be positively fizzing. Villa manager John Gregory admitted the offence was blatant, while at the same time arguing that his record signing Juan Pablo Angel was the victim of an equally clear penalty-box push earlier. When Stone punished a rare absence of defensive discipline with a close range header from Steve Staunton's corner, Villa looked well capable of gaining their first league victory at home for three months. Instead, Gregory was left to reflect ruefully on an equaliser just after half-time by Ugo Ehiogu, the man he sold to Middlesbrough for \u00a38million, and who delivered the perfect response to a crowd who gave him an uncomfortable homecoming by converting a corner from Keith O'Neill with a thumping header. Ehiogu milked the goal for all it was worth - and who could blame him? 'It was an awful goal to concede,' said Gregory, concerned at the absence of a marker. 'But to be fair to the big man he took it well. I just wish he had done that sort of thing for us.' While his team have enough points in the bank to prevent being sucked into the relegation battle, Gregory is concerned about a lack of for ward power, with \u00a39.5million signing Angel continuing to struggle with the pace of the English game. 'He's having a tough time off the field,' said Gregory. 'His wife and baby son have both been ill and he's being living out of a suitcase. The demands on him are massive. I am sure when he settles he will get better.' In terms of possession, Villa enjoyed much more of this game. But for all the prompting and probing of Paul Merson, they often ran into blind alleys against a team whose organisation was again spot on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
