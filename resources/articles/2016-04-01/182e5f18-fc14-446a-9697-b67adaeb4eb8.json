The group of tribal members, which numbered around 200, according to a tribal spokesman, said they were worried that the Dakota Access Pipeline, proposed by a subsidiary of the Dallas, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, would lead to contamination of the river. The proposed route also passes through lands of historical significance to the Standing Rock Lakota Sioux Nation, including burial grounds. \u201cThey\u2019re going under the river 500 yards from my son\u2019s grave, my father\u2019s grave, my aunt who I buried last week,\u201d said Ladonna Allard, a member of the Standing Rock nation and the closest landowner to the proposed pipeline. \u201cI really love my land, and if that pipeline breaks everything is gone.\u201d \u201cWe must fight every inch of our lives to protect the water,\u201d Allard said. A \u201cspiritual camp\u201d will be set up starting Saturday at the point where the proposed pipeline would cross the river, and the tribal members plan to stay and protest indefinitely. The group is composed of members of the Standing Rock nation as well as others from North and South Dakota nations, including the Cheyenne River Lakota and the Rosebud Sioux. They joined together to ride, run and walk from the Tribal Administration Building north to Cannonball, North Dakota, on the reservation\u2019s northern edge. The Missouri river is the primary source of drinking water for the tribal reservation, according to Doug Crow Ghost, a spokesman for the Standing Rock Sioux and the director of the tribe\u2019s water office, who joined the protest on Friday. Tribal members also fish in the river, he said. \u201cBecause we are going to be fighting this giant, all the rest of the nations came on horseback to say \u2018we support you\u2019,\u201d said Allard. \u201cThat is why this horse ride is so important to us. Because we\u2019re not alone in this fight. All of our nations are coming to stand with us, and all our allies and partners. This pipeline is illegal.\u201d The pipeline is currently waiting on a decision from a colonel in the army corps of engineers, who oversees such projects, on whether Dakota Access will be granted a permit to proceed, according to Dallas Goldtooth, a Keep It In The Ground campaign organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribes are petitioning for an environmental impact study, which has not at this point been done, into the pipeline. Goldtooth is optimistic about the tribe\u2019s chances of stopping the pipeline. \u201cIt infringes on the tribe\u2019s water rights, which are guaranteed by treaties, and the protocols associated with those rights were not followed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tribes have a really strong standing-point on this issue and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll see a whole environmental impact study enacted.\u201d Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cAlthough we do live on a reservation, the land that [the Dakota Access pipeline is] going to be crossing is on original land that was given us by treaty,\u201d said Dakota Kidder, a member of the Standing Rock nation. \u201cThis is where it gets people fired up when you talk about broken treaties.\u201d \u201cWithout water there is no life, and this is our main source,\u201d Kidder added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just our issue. Everybody downriver of us is going to be affected, all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. We\u2019re not just looking out for ourselves; we\u2019re looking out for all people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
