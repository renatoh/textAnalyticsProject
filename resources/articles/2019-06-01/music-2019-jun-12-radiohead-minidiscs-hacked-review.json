Jonny Greenwood was marginally more effusive: \u201cOnly tangentially interesting. And very very long.\u201d You get the sense that their hand was forced by a hacker who was hoping to charge $150,000 for the recordings, which were subsequently leaked; the band are now selling them and giving the proceeds to environmental campaigners Extinction Rebellion. Yorke and Greenwood are absolutely wrong though. This is the holy grail \u2013 or perhaps Ark of the Covenant \u2013 for hardcore Radiohead disciples, and even has merit for less nerdish fans. It reveals the inner workings of what is regarded by many as the greatest album of the 1990s, showing how they walked alongside and then turned away from the brash Britpop that surrounded them. Here are some of the songs to look out for. Lift (1:00:15 on MD126) The nine versions of Lift across the MiniDiscs suggest this is the big song from this era that Radiohead could never get quite right. They did release a version of it eventually, for OK Computer\u2019s 20th-anniversary edition \u2013 but it was much more muted than the ones they left in the vaults. Of the three studio versions here, #1 has the heavier guitars (9:46 on MD125), but #3 has the vocals mixed better, plus a nice keytar-ish solo. Either way, it\u2019s the maximalist sound of peak Britpop: giant chords, even bigger string section, soaring Yorke top line. It\u2019s what EMI were probably hoping for in a first single instead of Paranoid Android \u2013 and yet for all its satisfying robustness, along with the raptures among fans at this finally seeing the light, it is ultimately a conservative song and feels like a path the band were right to fork from. But a polished gem nevertheless. True Love Waits (15:43 on MD111) For years this was the great white whale for Radiohead fans \u2013 frequently played live, an acoustic version closed out their live album I Might Be Wrong before it was finally recorded, 20 years after it was written, in a twinkling, wintry, piano-driven version for A Moon Shaped Pool. Here we get the straightforward version many have craved. Driven by a characterful bassline \u2013 reminiscent of the one on Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Come to Me \u2013 and an almost hip-hop breakbeat from Phil Selway, the rhythm section really suits it, though the meandering synth line is arguably distracting and underdone. Attention (37:42 on MD115) Or rather Attenzione! according to the Yorke-scrawled tracklisting. This song, a version of which got a super limited release on a cassette for OK Computer\u2019s 20th anniversary, crops up a few times in various forms \u2013 this is the full-band version and therefore as definitive as it gets. It\u2019s underpinned by remarkably breezy strummed chords, a little reminiscent of early songs like Stop Whispering where Yorke\u2019s near-permanent shoulder tension seemed to relax. You can see why it was left off the fretful OK Computer, and suggests there was a much happier Britpop band that could have emerged out of The Bends. \u201cHurts to Walk\u201d (52:21 on MD112) Another indication the band were making some much (fitter) happier material during the OK Computer sessions. Hurts to Walk \u2013 the fan title; judging from the MiniDisc label it could perhaps be called Girl Club or Get Together \u2013 ambles along with bright, cooing vocals behind its chorus, overstrummed guitar that has all the dopey warmth of a late-summer wasp. It sounds like Pavement fronted by a naive Brit, or the indie-slacker-Beach-Boys sound of Teenage Fanclub, who supported Radiohead on the OK Computer tour. A really endearing curio that suggests that once the band had vented their splenetic paranoia, it was all chill vibes, bro. Last Flowers (2:42 on MD117) With some different lyrics, this song eventually ended up on an In Rainbows bonus disc as a fairly typical Radiohead piano-and-acoustic trudge. The earlier version is more fleshed-out and idiosyncratic, with jaunty guitars, flirty lyrics (\u201cBaby what you doing tonight?\u201d) and a spiralling film-score synth line. The strings, done on synths in this demo version, suggest, as with Lift, that the band were quite taken with Britpop\u2019s enthusiasm for string sections \u2013 most iconically on the Verve\u2019s Bitter Sweet Symphony and Blur\u2019s The Universal \u2013 but ultimately ditched them for a less obviously fashionable palette. A wise decision that has kept OK Computer isolated from its peers. Unknown title (57:01 on MD113) A peculiar jam that \u2013 truth be told \u2013 needs a lot more time in the oven. But it\u2019s notable for the bright, crude synths, recalling Vangelis\u2019s synthetic brass lines for the Blade Runner soundtrack, and there\u2019s something seductive about its constant loping gait: it hints at the more purely electronic experiments that eventually ended up at Idioteque. This track comes off the back of what fans have called Thom\u2019s Screechy Song, a pleasingly rough, ill-disciplined and noisy unreleased track with shades of Sonic Youth. I Need a Job (22:10 on MD117) There\u2019s shades of 90s alt-rockers like Sebadoh to this choppy, strikingly straightforward tune \u2013 the kind of thing a conservative subset of Radiohead fans wish the band had continued to make instead of broadening out into OK Computer and Kid A. And to be fair, Yorke\u2019s high, girlish voice does pair strongly with rather more knuckle-drugging guitars. Similar but not so good is MD115\u2019s When I Get Bored Give Me One of Those, which, could easily have ended up as a bad Oasis imitation \u2013 but it equally could have been a National Anthem-sized experimental rocker. Paranoid Android (5:36 on MD115) Whole swathes of the MiniDiscs are given to alternate versions of OK Computer songs \u2013 or fragments, or live versions \u2013 which casual fans are unlikely to visit more than once. But this garage rock demo of Paranoid Android is great: rough and tumbling, it stretches to 11 minutes with a psych wig out at the end. The song\u2019s weirdly liturgical extended middle eight is made even more holy with Yorke\u2019s \u201challelujahs\u201d, which became wordless cries on the studio version. Nude (49:54 on MD115) The MiniDiscs aren\u2019t short of scrappy Yorke solo takes, but these are at the very least always interesting \u2013 and in some cases startlingly beautiful. This waltzing version of Nude, Yorke\u2019s voice reedy in the cheap microphone and the beat seemingly tapped out on a table, is testament to the strength of his songwriting. That lilting melody is instantly classic, even in such impoverished surroundings. At 9:05 on MD113, there\u2019s a full-band version powered by organ; it would be another 10 years before it was finally recorded for In Rainbows in a much more delicate, grownup take. A Reminder (0:00 on MD128) Other Yorke solo numbers to check out include the ones that open MD118, particularly the detuned guitar instrumental at the very beginning \u2013 the kind of thing Alan Lomax might have recorded on a front porch in Mississippi. The most sublime, though, is this song, later fully recorded and included on the Airbag/How Am I Driving? EP in the wake of OK Computer. The a cappella demo is startlingly atmospheric. Recorded out on a hillside somewhere \u2013 you can hear someone tell Yorke \u201cthe whole mountain\u2019s yours\u201d before he begins singing \u2013 it\u2019s just Yorke and the sound of the wind blowing across his microphone. The lyrics \u2013 \u201cIf I get old / I will not give in / But if I do / Remind me of this / Remind me that / Once I was free\u201d \u2013 become intensely moving, an affirmation of the fire of life perched on the edge of the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
