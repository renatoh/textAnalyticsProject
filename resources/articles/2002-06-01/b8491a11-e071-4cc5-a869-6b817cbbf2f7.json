With Barcelona now overtaking Paris as a destination for weekend breaks by air - and with a bewildering array of restaurants to choose from - you don't want to make the wrong choice and end up eating deep-fried squid rings and drinking sangr\u00eda in an overpriced tourist trap on the Ramblas. New-wave Catalan cuisine, designer tapas and traditional llesqueries, the finest cured hams, cheeses and breads, are more representative of Barcelona's culinary offering today. The city is blazing a new culinary trail, and the future is... foam. It started with chef Ferran Adria at his restaurant El Bulli, on the Costa Brava. Adria took a chance gift, a carbon dioxide canister for whipping cream, and turned it into a means of subverting the established order of things, fostering a thousand imitators and frustrating chefs, food writers and those who thought they understood how a chef came to earn three Michelin stars. Adria doesn't so much cook as reinvent food. On a basic level, he'll take a dish - tortilla, say - take it apart, and reintroduce it as mounds of foam: potato, onion and egg. And that's just the beginning. He will take jelly and make it hot; a spoonful of soup and make it cold and then hot; take herbs and turn them into ice cream. He will make ravioli where the 'pasta' is actually paper-thin cuttlefish, and rub his hands with glee as it explodes in your mouth. He will take paella and turn it into seafood-flavoured Rice Krispies; or serve crab bisque in a pipette. His phenomenal success and the interest he has generated at home and abroad have inspired a new generation of Catalan chefs, changing the face of the Barcelona restaurant scene forever. Few could have imagined five years ago that the average plateful of petit fours would include ginger-flavoured, chocolate-covered Pop Rocks (aka Space Dust). Yep, after a period in quarantine - labelled possibly carcinogenic and certainly palate-cratering - the scourge of Seventies schoolkids' dogs is back. But only in the finest restaurants. Ostentatious, and unabashedly pretentious, like so much of what makes Barcelona great, this new wave of cuisine is best sampled within its culinary context. There is no shortage of places serving gutsy country cooking: goose with apples, duck with pears, or the time-honoured Catalan combination of mar i muntanya (sea and mountain) - lobster with rabbit or chicken stuffed with shrimp. Lazy holiday grazing doesn't get any better than this, either; whether your bag is a plate of garlicky clams with your beer at an old-school tapas bar or a bottle of lusty Catalan wine and hunks of cheese at a llesqueria. Llesque is Catalan for slice, and refers to the stack of pa amb tom\u00e0quet (bread rubbed with a plump, ripe tomato and drizzled with olive oil) and the plates of cured ham, cheese and sausages that are the speciality of the llesqueries. And then there's the late dictator General Franco's only sensible legacy - the men\u00fa del dia . By law, all but the upmarket restaurants in Spain must provide a workers' lunch: a set menu of two or three courses and a drink for about a fiver. At best they can be fantastic, at worst they're cheap and filling. Prices: Symbols denote the average cost of a starter, main course and pudding for one person - not including wine, service or cover charge: \u20ac under 20 euros; \u20ac\u20ac 20-30 euros; \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac 30-45 euros; \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac over 45 euros. There are roughly 1.5 euros to the pound. In the llesqueries , you are likely to pay an average of \u20ac20 (just over \u00a313) a head not including wine. Tapas cost between \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 per head, or \u20ac15 if you make a meal of them (not including wine). New wave Cata 181, Carrer Valencia 181 (00 34 93 323 6818) \u20ac. A wine lovers' paradise with a superb list of wines available in 25cl decanters and dinky saucerfuls of food to go with them. The list includes little hamburgers with tiny cones of chips, salted liver specially treated with liqueur and sugar with strawberry sauce, and miniature parcels of cheese and tomato; but all are overshadowed by soft, treacly pigs' trotters with figs, walnuts and honey ice-cream. Comer\u00e7 24, Carrer Comer\u00e7 24 (00 34 93 319 2102) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. Go for the men\u00fa festival; a parade of designer tapas beginning with 'Irish Coffee'. What actually arrives is two glasses; one containing a hot foie gras soup and topped with a cold sweetcorn foam, the other a hot sweetcorn soup with a head of cold foie gras foam - both better than they sound. Later you might get an old favourite given a new lease of life: a chocolate ganache (mousse) with wafer-thin slices of fried bread, olive oil and salt; an implausibly good take on a teatime dish beloved of the nation's grandmothers. Espai Sucre, Carrer Princesa 53 (00 34 93 268 1630) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. This might just be the only pudding restaurant in the world. The only choice you have to make is whether to have the peque\u00f1o men\u00fa (three puddings) or the gran men\u00fa (five). But don't go expecting spotted dick. Imagine a layer of crunchy celery confit and julienned red apple, on to which is poured a lychee soup with a sprinkling of finely diced cucumber and a drizzle of tamarind cream. Finally (still following?) a cider and Calvados sorbet is placed in the middle, and spiked with caramelised Fisherman's Friend. Ot, Carrer Torres 25 (00 34 93 284 7752) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. Tiny, colourful and run with verve by two young disciples of Adria. There is no menu; waiters bring a selection of dishes that might include prawn tempura with curry foam or ravioli of smoked aubergine served with pancetta in a turr\u00f3n (almond nougat) soup. Puddings have included a delicious thyme ice cream with a balsamic vinegar reduction. Santa Maria, Carrer Comer\u00e7 17 (00 34 93 315 1227) \u20ac\u20ac. International standards such as sushi, falafel or tuna mojama (thinly sliced, dried and cured) are competently rendered as designer tapas, but the desserts get really interesting. Try the pasi\u00f3n de Lola ; a shotglass layered with the ubiquitous Pop Rocks, raspberries, a creamy passionfruit mousse and topped with a 'head' of dense beer foam. Catalan Cafe de l'Academia, Carrer Lledo 1 (00 34 93 319 8253) \u20ac\u20ac. With cosy, shaded tables outside on a tranquil medieval square, this might be the best place in the city for modern Catalan dishes. Try cold anchovy lasagne with chargrilled peppers; roast guinea fowl with a tiny tarte tatin, or the rossejat - Catalunya's answer to risotto. It's excellent and cheap so book. Casa Calvet, Carrer Casp 48 (00 34 93 412 4012) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. Gaudi's dazzling modernista interior with swirling woodwork and graceful stained glass is the showcase for pea soup with chunks of squid, succulent pigeon with Szechuan pepper and roast fennel, and tasty lamb 'meatballs' with creamy risotto. Puddings are supreme - especially the crunchy pine nut tart with foamed crema Catalana - and the wine list encyclopaedic. Can Sol\u00e9, Carrer Sant Carles 4 (00 34 93 221 5012) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. Five metres off the main tourist drag; a small step for the customer but a giant leap for paella: dark and delicious with the rice crisped up around the edges, and spiked with the juiciest seafood imaginable. The scumbled, sea-blue walls of CanSol\u00e9 heave with awards, photographs and mementoes of past habitu\u00e9s. Can Gaig, Passeig Maragall 402 (00 34 93 429 1017) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. From the huevo trufado - a soft egg yolk sitting in a warm, soft meringue and speckled with black truffle, or turbot served with its own 'crackling' and a nest of cuttlefish noodles, through to a shotglass holding layers of tangy lemon syrup, crema Catalana mousse, caramel ice-cream and topped with burnt sugar, every dish is as surprising and perfectly composed as the last. The Can Gaig is a trek from the city centre but the the excellent food makes it worth every minute of the journey. Els Pescadors, Pla\u00e7a Prim 1 (00 34 93 225 2018) \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac. The best of modern and traditional Barcelona, with an emphasis on fresh fish. A tuile basket of baby broad beans comes dressed with chocolate vinaigrette; cod is baked with honey and served with twirls of membrillo (quince jelly). Puddings are also wonderful, with lemon and ginger ice-cream on a bed of mango carpaccio or a fruit lasagne with warm chocolate sauce. Tapas Cal Pep, Pla\u00e7a de les Olles 8 (00 34 93 310 7961). Get there early for a seat at the bar, and prepare for some of the finest seafood in the city. The squid is as tender as you'll find, the tallarines (wedge clams) are divine, and if Pep lets on that the day's prawns are good, you'd be a fool to demur at the price. Euskal Extea, Placeta Montcada 1-3 (00 34 93 310 2185). Pintxos are the Basque way of doing tapas: they are colourful morsels speared with a cocktail stick - and they are never better than here. For the full regional experience, wash them down with txacoli, a lightly sparkling white wine. Keep the sticks - they'll be tallied up at the end when you pay. Quimet i Quimet, Carrer Poeta Cabanyes 25 (00 34 93 442 3142). A handkerchief-sized neighbourhood bar with a great little selection of tapas and walls lined with bottles of wine and cava, some of it exceptional. Prepare to stand, possibly on the pavement. El Portal\u00f3n, Carrer Banys Nous 20 (00 34 93 302 1187). Every day the crowds surge up this narrow street seeking the authentic and splendid, yet still they manage to miss this fiercely old-school bodega, with its gruff waiters, terracotta pitchers of wines and interior barely changed since its time as a medieval stable. Llesqueries Not dissimilar to tapas, but where you get slices of tomato bread and cheese and ham. Pla de la Garsa, Carrer Assaonadors 13 (00 34 93 315 2413). An elegant sixteenth-century space with marble-topped tables and a wrought-iron spiral staircase leading up to another secluded dining room. As well as the pa amb tom\u00e0quet, the pt\u00e9s, the wonderful charcuterie and meticulously sourced selection of unpasteurised cheeses, there is also a handful of dishes based on medieval recipes. La Tinaja, Carrer Esparter\u00eda 9 (00 34 93 310 2250). The old crocks hanging like swallows' nests from the beams, the collection of farm implements and the lofty stone arches create a rustic atmosphere in which to sample standard llesqueria fare, washed down with a good value bottle of wine. Finish off with their fine tarta de Santiago; almond cake onto which you pour a glass of moscatell. La Vinateria del Call, Carrer Sant Dom\u00e8nec del Call 9 (00 34 93 302 6092). This narrow llesqueria, furnished with dark wood and dusty bottles, has something of the Dickensian tavern about it, but once inside there's an eclectic music selection from flamenco to ra\u00ee , and lively multilingual staff. The wine list and range of hams and cheeses are outstanding; try the cecina de ciervo - thin slices of cured venison. Va de Vi, Carrer Banys Vells 16 (00 34 93 319 2900). Withits sixteenth-century arches, candles and heavy drapery, Va de Vi is a fabulous place to try wines by the glass. Along with hams and pt\u00e9s, the real speciality is cheese, with more than 50 varieties from Spain and further afield. Beyond the city El Bulli, Cala Montjoi-Ap.30, 17480 Roses Gerona 00 34 972 150457. The waiting list for a table is said to be more than a year long. Four miles from the Dantean tourist hub of Roses, on the Costa Brava, you find it down an almost inaccessible dirt track. It is breathtakingly expensive.
