How the current Derby manager must rue that help after his side was given a lesson in the rigours of First Division football last night. With their modest stadium Gillingham seem to have little in common with Derby, except that both sides are struggling financially and have declared they are open to offers for their marketable players. With such as Mart Poom, Rob Lee and Fabrizio Ravanelli in their ranks, Derby have a host of senior caps, plus a handful of under-21s while Gillingham have no one of international distinction. But, while Gillingham have never been in the top flight, Derby will want to get back into the Premiership to avoid midweek games like these, in compact stadiums against unfashionable sides intent on stopping them playing football. Gillingham, for all their differences, did not start with an inferiority complex. Twice in the opening five minutes they threatened Poom's goal. Guy Ipoua tried his luck from distance to force the goalkeeper to turn the ball round a post, then Mamady Sidibe, making his home debut, volleyed the subsequent corner over the bar from 10 yards. Derby seemed not to know what had hit them, Gillingham's energetic style being at odds with their own attempts at measured passing. Just past the quarter-hour the home side went ahead. Simon Osborn floated in a free-kick, the Derby defence sprinted out in the hope of an offside flag, Ipoua's header was parried by Poom but Paul Shaw had time to fire home the rebound. Derby struggled to get into their stride, Malcolm Christie going closest with a couple of headers that did not test Jason Brown. Gillingham almost doubled their lead when Hessenthaler got on the end of a neat move, crossed from the right and Sidibe missed a simple header from six yards. Derby did not look much more convincing after the break, although Lee Morris sped past three Gillingham players on one fine run and cut the ball inside to Ravanelli but the Italian shot just wide of the far post. That spurred the visitors on and Chris Hope was forced into a last-ditch tackle to deny Ravanelli after Christie's neat cross. On the other hand, Ipoua had a strong claim for a penalty turned down when he appeared to be held back by Warren Barton as he turned in the area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
