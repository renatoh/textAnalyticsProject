Alan Pardew was annoyed last Tuesday when Jos\u00e9 Enrique, his Spanish left-back, informed Twitter followers he would miss the team's game at Tottenham through injury. As Enrique, happily restored to fitness for tomorrow's trip to Wigan, is a key player, Pardew had intended keeping his absence quiet until the teamsheets appeared. \"We are giving a presentation to the squad about the current format of information,\" Newcastle's manager said. \"Hopefully we will get that right. We don't want players tweeting about their fitness on the day of games but we are not going to stop freedom of speech. It is not the Chinese republic here.\" Still seeking an assistant, Pardew could turn to John Carver, the former Newcastle coach who has recently served as Sheffield United's caretaker manager. \"John did a super job here,\" Pardew said. \"I have met him a couple of times and he's a good guy. I need a senior coach, somebody who can assist me in what is a big job. It needs to be someone the players respect.\" Pardew is hoping to sign at least one striker this month and may be permitted to recruit two should Andy Carroll \u2013 who misses the Wigan game after consulting a specialist in London about a thigh injury on Friday \u2013 be out for any length of time. \"We won't leave any stone unturned for any player who becomes available who we think can take the club forward,\" he said before revealing that a \"serious conversation\" about transfer targets with his board would \"probably take place on Monday or Tuesday. We are just looking at the market and making phone calls to see who is and isn't available. Then we will have to nail it down.\" Not that Pardew, who may recall Steve Harper in goal tomorrow, is unhappy with his current squad. \"I have found very strong professionalism,\" he said. \"Plenty of our players would leave their granny out in the rain to win a game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
