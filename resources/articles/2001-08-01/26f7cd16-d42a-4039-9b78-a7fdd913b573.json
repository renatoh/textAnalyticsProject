Five up at the interval, the Casuals won 7-0 and were much sharper under a cool moon than a searing sun as they booked a home tie with Horsham YMCA on Saturday. This extra preliminary-round replay was the first that Franklyn Road had seen in the Cup. It was played under the lights that two years ago completed Casuals' qualification and, at their switch-on, drew the ground's record crowd of 315. Last night there were 100, compared with 69 on Saturday. At Saltdean one of them was the lad with the garden rake who retrieved shots from the trees and bushes. Walton's ground is close enough to the Thames almost to warrant ball-bathers. A water polo team could get good practice. Saturday's programme said: \"Our opponents are an unknown entity to us as they play in the Combined Counties League.\" After a match in which seven men were booked and Walton's central defender Mark Osikoya sent off, such innocence was past. It was hard and clumsy then but hardly dirty and Osikoya, the FA's brand manager for Axa, the Cup's sponsor, will appeal that his high foot as he came out of a backwards somersault accidentally caught an opponent. He may fare better than the Saltdean player whose team-mate shouted: \"Ref, you can't book him: he's only just come on\". The intensity was none the less last night for the continuing carrot of \u00a3500 to the winners. Prize and pride ensured no let-up. The linesman who saw things differently on Saturday was not officiating but the referee Ben Knight was the same, obliged and happy to come back for further abuse and another \u00a325. He graduated this summer in international business; it cannot be worse than the local stuff. The chat is rough and ritual. \"I turn a deaf ear,\" he said, rather as those who christened Saltdean turned a colour-blind eye; the nickname is Tigers, the stripes red and black. Osikoya got into better books before the start by arranging for the Cup to be on the pitch and setting up coverage on Sky Sports News. He was soon outsider dealing too, crucially tackling Ian Costello on the point of shooting. On the quarter-hour the floodgates opened and did not close until half-time. A 30-yard drive and a lob by the slippery Steve Fitzgerald sandwiched a header by Grant Woolger, up for a corner; and Dave Pearson added two sitters in five minutes. The last two goals did not come until the last minute, through Jamie Reive's free-kick and Emerson Barrs-James. It causes fresh embarrassment of a happier kind for Osikoya. He was due to be in Munich with the FA on Saturday. Now he will be back here - Cup and club before country. Football's problems never change. As for Saltdean, their road turned into a cul-de-sac. After the mass departure of last year's successful team they asked boys to be men and it was too soon. But, to their credit, their second-half performance suggested the first was an aberration. As their secretary Iain Fielding said: \"We are a small club full of good people.\" He might as easily have been referring to Walton. Walton Casuals (4-3-3) Smyrk; Castronovo, Woolger, Osikoya, Classey; Reive, Noad (Mattingley, 56min), Cooksley; Pearson, Barrs-James, Fitzgerald (Malik, 69). Saltdean United (4-3-3) Manthorpe; Jordan, Silsby, Fensome, Assefi (Boddy, h-t); Fleming, Aldis, Davis; MacMillan, Rowland, Costello. Referee: B Knight (Waterlooville). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
