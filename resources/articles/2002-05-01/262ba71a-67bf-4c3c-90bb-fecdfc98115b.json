An aid to decision-making that goes beyond merely analysing the current situation and extrapolating from it. This is a \"what if\" approach where stories are created about how things could work out. It requires a willing suspension of disbelief, questioning the 'official future' as well as an acceptance of possible futures. Effective scenarios are plausible yet surprising and powerful enough to challenge stereotypes and assumptions. They're based on research into trends, forces and uncertainties. Why bother? It's a way of coping with uncertainty and a good technique for countering natural optimism-bias or wishful thinking. Being forced to think of negative outcomes is an aid to developing robust strategies. Rehearsing what to do if the unexpected happens is a good preparation for dealing with anything fate throws at you. You choose actions that could be adapted to whichever story turns into reality. Being about right is better than being precisely wrong. Where can I find out more? Leeds University and London Business Schools have modules on scenario thinking in undergraduate courses and MBAs.
