Shakespeare contributed more phrases to the English language than any other writer. A glance at the career of David Croft, who died last week, aged 89, suggests just what a contribution he, and the sitcom tradition he did so much to create, made to the way we talk. Croft's knack with a catchphrase was incomparable: \"They don't like it up 'em!\"; \"You stupid boy\"; \"I'm free!\"; \"Hi-de-hi, campers!\"; \"Good moaning!\"; \"Don't panic, don't panic!\" With his co-writers Jimmy Perry and Jeremy Lloyd, Croft created more classic sitcoms than anyone who ever wrote for TV or radio. Other comedy writers were satiric, or anarchic or left wing, but Croft tapped into Britain's endless appetite for nostalgia and seaside smut. His settings were the backwaters of the Second World War (in Britain, France, India and Burma), the gruelling holidays of our childhood and the last vestiges of the feudal system. Against these backdrops, he was safe to uncork sexual innuendos that would have made Joe Orton blush. \"At seven o'clock tonight,\" Mrs Slocombe would declare, \"my pussy's expecting to see a friendly face!\" Croft caught the last echoes of Empire, the farcical side of the decline of a nation that had governed nearly half the planet when he was born in 1922. In his evocations, Britain was ridiculous, even pathetic, but still trustworthy. It was the pig-headed courage of a bank manager squeezed into an officer's uniform. It was the implacable standards of a department store floorwalker who insisted on being addressed as \"Captain\". It was bracing larks beside the campsite pool and the unrequited love of a chalet maid with the sniffles. It was mocking the French for their faint hearts and secretly envying their libido. It was healthy tolerance of homosexuals, so long as they confined themselves to saucy asides. Above all, it was co-operation between the classes. Now Croft has gone \u2013 and that sense of Britain went with him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
