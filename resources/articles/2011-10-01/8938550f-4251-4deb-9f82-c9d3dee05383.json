So hapless. The way they wrinkle up their noses when they smell commitment. The adorable grimace as you wipe yogurt from their beards with a licked hankie and their bubbling glee at the sight of a weighty breast. Poor, pathetic men, bloated with idiocy. Poor little guys, incapable of almost everything. Rarely will a week pass without some recognition of the fact \u2013 whether in an advert for washing powder or as the punchline of a sitcom \u2013 that grown men must be babysat. The latest example is Australian Ikea's experimental creche for men. Based on Sm\u00e5land, their existing child-play area, Manland is an enclosed space set away from all the shelving fuss where women are invited to leave their partners while they shop. There are hot dogs in case they get hungry. And table football and flat-screen TVs \"showing nothing but sports\", and computer games for them to play with while the women fret sensibly over cutlery. And after half an hour, before they get too overexcited and tired and in need of a wee, a buzzer goes off in their wives' pockets as a reminder to pick them up. Imagine the carnage if there were no buzzer. Imagine the sweaty faces pressed up against the wide car-park windows, stubble turning into beard, if the women weren't reminded to collect their men, instead returning home alone, leaving their husbands to fend for themselves amongst the secondary storage, the Knubbigs, the Ektorps. Each day throwing off their royal blue fleece-effect blankets, rising yawning from their modular chaises, each day exploring their fellow forgotten men's eyes and bodies and emotions, each day discovering new ways of living sans femme. In Ikea, there are a hundred words for love. There are so many things wrong with the idea of the man creche I'm tempted to alphabetise them. Not least the publicist's explanation of the reasoning behind their proud infantilisation project: \"Despite most men dreading a trip to the shops, we still attract a high proportion of male customers,\" she said. \"So we're expecting the scheme to be a real success with both sexes.\" The thing is, I like the idea of a fun space where you can eat sausages when you get bored of shopping \u2013 everyone should be free to not shop. It's only when it's a gendered space that it becomes maddening. When men are encouraged to be adorably mediocre and leave the \"real work\" to the women \u2013 women who often feel disempowered in every arena but for the shop floor, where we storm down aisles like credit-charging armies, and at home, where women claim ownership of areas like the kitchen, happily tutting at their husbands' attempts to cook beans. The rotten thing about this idea \u2013 the idea that men must be coddled while their wives get things done \u2013 is that it looks a little bit like feminism. It has all the harmonies of feminism, but none of the tune \u2013 it shows women as capable, powerful, successful, strong. But the focus of the relationship remains the man, chewing on a hot dog in his brightly coloured pen while the woman rushes through the throws department frantically checking tog ratings before her buzzer sounds. There's no hint of equality; it's been bypassed by faux maternalism. Everyone comes off badly in this man-child clich\u00e9 \u2013 the happily pathetic husband and his domestic goddess wife, only powerful when shopping. It simultaneously mocks men and promotes \"the man\". It's quite wow, I think, for 2011. Ikea is considering rolling Manlands out across the world. This is a mistake. Manland is like a feminism pi\u00f1ata filled with dog poo and confetti. It's feminism flatpacked but missing the crucial screw. When Manlands come to Britain, I'm picketing. I am. And I'll get signatures for my petition using Ikea's own tiny free pencils, \"Ha!\"ing angrily with an air punch every time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
