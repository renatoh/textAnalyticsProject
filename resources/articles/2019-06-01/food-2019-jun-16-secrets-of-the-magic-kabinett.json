I\u2019m not talking about the multi-syllabic names, inscrutably, tongue-twistingly prolix to a non-German speaker. It\u2019s more the indicated alcohol content, and the gap between what the label says and how the wine tastes. Take, for example, the latest vintage of Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt\u2019s delightful riesling, which you can find in around 200 Co-ops. The label says 9% abv, which might lead you to expect something weak and watery, given almost every other white on the shelf has more than 12%. But the wine itself, graceful and elegant, is full of flavour, of pear and peach, blossom and lemon zestiness, and has some weight too. A delicious puzzle. Weingut von H\u00f6vel Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett, Mosel, Germany 2017 (\u00a318, Wine Society) Low alcohol with full flavour is a hallmark of the classic kabinett style. The term refers to the amount of sugar in the grapes when they\u2019re harvested, part of a uniquely Germanic method of classifying wines by the density of grape juice before it\u2019s fermented. Kabinett is the lightest style; then in ascending levels of sugar, sp\u00e4tlese, auslese, beerenauslese and trockenbeerenauslese. Confusingly, a sp\u00e4tlese will not always taste sweeter than a kabinett: a winemaker may ferment all the sugar into alcohol to make a dry wine with a higher abv. Much as I love many modern dry German rieslings, there\u2019s something especially appealing at this time of year about gently sweet kabinetts such as Von H\u00f6vel\u2019s (8%), with its interplay of pure sweet pear and dancing acidity. JJ Pr\u00fcm Riesling Kabinett, Mosel, Germany 2015 (\u00a325, Forest Wines; Howard Ripley Wines) The Mosel Valley may be one of the world\u2019s most beautiful wine regions. But all those picturesque terraced vineyards rising up from the meandering river also makes it one of the hardest to work as a producer. Whether you\u2019re harvesting or pruning, it\u2019s backbreaking on a gradient of more than 30 degrees (and over 60 degrees in a few sites). Producers, often small family firms, aren\u2019t helped by having their vineyard holdings split over various sites, or by their habit of making so many different wines from them. A Mosel producer may make dozens of single-vineyard wines each year \u2013 and each site may yield a kabinett, a sp\u00e4tlese, etc. Confusing, but also manna from heaven for wine collectors, with the wines of the great JJ Pr\u00fcm estate \u2013 known for their lacy, racy filigree charm \u2013 justly among the region\u2019s most coveted.
