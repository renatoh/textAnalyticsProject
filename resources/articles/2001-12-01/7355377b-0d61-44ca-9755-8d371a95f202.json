Elland Road chairman Peter Ridsdale confirmed the move in a signed statement this evening, bringing to an end the latest chapter in an increasingly sad saga for the club. After being cleared of two charges at Hull Crown Court last week in relation to the attack on Sarfraz Najeib, Bowyer then refused to pay a fine amounting to four weeks wages which Leeds had tried to impose on him. Bowyer was today informed that he is likely to face civil proceedings brought by Najeib. While acknowledging that the player - touted for England honours following the end of the criminal proceedings - had been cleared, Ridsdale asserted that because the Londoner had given evidence admitting he had consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol, he had flouted club regulations and deserved a fine above the two-week maximum agreed with the Professional Footballers' Association. Bowyer disagreed and the stand-off looked likely to result in the player leaving West Yorkshire, only for the intervention of PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. \"A financial contribution equivalent to that previously stated has been agreed between the three parties and will be put towards the club's community programme for work within inner city communities and a local children's hospice,\" added Ridsdale. \"Leeds United would like to go on record thanking Gordon Taylor, Lee's agent David Geiss and his legal advisor Steven Barker for their assistance in resolving this issue. \"Leeds United would like to make it clear this is an internal disciplinary issue and in no way relates to the case at Hull Crown Court.\" The Leeds supporters made their feelings known during last night's 3-2 Premiership win against Everton at Elland Road, unfurling a number of banners urging the midfielder to stay with the club and almost constantly chanting his name. Even Bowyer's team-mates showed a strong sign of solidarity, pointing to his position on the television gantry following a Robbie Fowler goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
