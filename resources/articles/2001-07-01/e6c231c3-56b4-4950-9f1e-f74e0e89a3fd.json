Yet he still retains, rather doggedly, the haunting notion that he has underachieved. Adam Hollioake, who captains Surrey against Gloucestershire in today's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final at Lord's, might be accused of self-indulgence. Most players can only dream of underachieving so grandly as this. But in terms of attitude the elder of the Hollioake brothers has never been an ordinary player. Combative, and exceptionally determined, he still has a fierce will to play for England. It is more than three years since he won his last cap, on the 1997-98 winter tour of the West Indies but he still holds out hope that there will be more - even though he will be 30 in a few weeks. \"My biggest disappointment, and something I've never mentioned before, was when I got blamed for losing the World Cup. Not personally, but I was one of the five or six people blamed for us going out of the competition two years ago. But I only got one innings! It was in that final match against India at Edgbaston. Yet here I was, being held responsible for England not going through. \"And one big mistake I've made over the years is to tell people my brother Ben's the talented one. That's backfired on me because now people think 'Oh, that's Adam, the untalented one'. What I've said has been largely true because Ben makes it look easy. He looks more stylish and relaxed. But I think I'm talented, too, in a different way. \"I read recently that I had given up on England and was concentrating on my Surrey career. But I'm very disappointed that I've given anyone that impression. I would love to get another opportunity to play for England. If I do I would run through a brick wall for the side because I'm a fighter. And with an average of almost 40 in the first-class game I must be able to play a bit.\" The high-water mark for the Hollioake family was when he and Ben made their England Test debuts together in the fifth Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1997. Adam's personal highlight came a few months later when he captained England's one-day side to victory in the Champions Trophy in Sharjah. In an era of very ordinary England captains Hollioake immediately stood out as a shrewd tactician and an instinctive leader of men. It was also in 1997 that Surrey made him captain in place of Alec Stewart. \"If I play for England again it will be as a batsman who can bowl a bit. And, to be truthful, that was always the case. I started off batting at six and as a sixth bowler. Somehow that changed, so in one-day matches I would bat at seven and be one of the front-line bowlers. \"But it's a real disappointment for me that we didn't stick with that Sharjah team for a bit longer. We went to the West Indies without a few important players, and got beaten. Then we got beaten by South Africa, who were the outstanding one-day team at the time. And that was it. End of experiment. But we had spent a year together and had really come on a great deal. All we needed were a few additions, like Gough, Caddick and Thorpe, and we would have been OK. \"In a sense I think the pressures of captaincy dented my international career. I feel the responsibility, after I had played just five one-day internationals, stunted my growth. I had bowled just 200 overs and scored a few runs and suddenly I was captain before I knew what the one-day game was all about. We had success and it was great. But it all happened very quickly.\" Hollioake says he has been looking forward to today's game with some excitement. \"I've not felt like this for a long time. This is as good as it gets. For me this is a battle between two heavyweight world champions. They've won a few one-day trophies lately so they are the crown champions, if you like, and we are the people's champions. It could all boil down to how they play Saqlain [Mushtaq] and how we play Ian Harvey. But if we can take wickets early on I will be interested to see how they come back at us.\" Hollioake says he has had more headaches this season than for many years. \"This has been a very difficult and frustrating summer. We're always delighted to provide players for England. But this season we've had so many injury problems. In the past couple of years we have been able to deal with it but I think we've used up all our good luck. I've got to say that everything went our way last season and the season before. \"The other week we lost four of our top six batsmen to England. And Mark Ramprakash and Jason Ratcliffe were injured too. I've never known a season when we've had so many changes. Everyone has been chopping and changing their role, batting seven one week and four the next. \"Gloucestershire's strength is that they haven't been losing players every week, like we have. They have a system and they play to it brilliantly. They don't have big names but they are such a well-drilled unit. In a way they remind me of the team I captained in Sharjah, the way they try to do things. They may not be the most talented but they have a plan and they do the basics well. Everyone knows his job and carries it out. \"It's not rocket science. There's no mystique here. But they do have total belief in themselves, as we did in Sharjah.\" With Hollioake thoughts of England are never far away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
