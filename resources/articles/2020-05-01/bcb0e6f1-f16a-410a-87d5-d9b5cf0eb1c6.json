The 10 rules for freezing food \u2013 from berries to beef", "bodyText": "Do not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. \u201cI don\u2019t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,\u201d confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cWe do our work freezer every couple of days.\u201d Like Matsunaga, many of us are looking anew at our freezers. Covid-19 has concentrated minds on saving money, minimising waste and shopping less frequently. People are storing more, collectively, and after a 30% spike in the month before lockdown, frozen food sales have continued to rise, according to the British Frozen Food Federation. You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book The Ice Kitchen Shivi Ramoutar describes as an \u201cunfashionable\u201d preservation method? What freezes well? What doesn\u2019t? How do you manage those icy depths? We asked the experts. Is there a broad rule when choosing what (not) to freeze? Freezing produces structurally damaging ice-crystals. Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, \u201cdrier\u201d ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods. For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher\u2019s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts \u2013 even high-grade, dry-aged beef \u2013 and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: \u201cThe muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak\u2019s juiciness becomes insipid. You\u2019ve broken its body.\u201d How do you protect food in that icy environment? Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded \u2013 so-called \u201cfreezer burn\u201d. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. \u201cFlat surface areas freeze quicker,\u201d says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet. Sorry, filing cabinet? We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. \u201cYou just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,\u201d says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food. Ramoutar\u2019s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: \u201cHow I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.\u201d You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily. Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. \u201cDon\u2019t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,\u201d advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. \u201cLay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out individual handfuls.\u201d Is there anything you should never freeze? Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. \u201cWhisk them slightly and add a stabiliser \u2013 salt or sugar, depending on what you\u2019re doing with them,\u201d suggests Ramoutar. Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food\u2019s textural integrity and will that matter? Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces \u2013 as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result. Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables \u2013 submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly \u2013 helps to retain colour and flavour. Can you freeze milk and cheese? Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton &amp; Whitfield. \u201cThe moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.\u201d What is the problem with fish? Historically, \u201cfresh\u201d fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: \u201cThis product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.\u201d Ideally, freeze whole fish or skin-on fillets. Brining the fillets (10% salt solution, 20-40 minutes), helps to firm up the delicate flesh. Thoroughly dry the fish, and wrap it in a moisture-absorbing cloth and lots of clingfilm. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve got enough, double it. The secret is knowing it\u2019s covered,\u201d says the chef John Molnar, owner of the Cod\u2019s Scallops fishmongers and chip shops in Nottingham. Molnar dislikes freezing seafood \u2013 although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus \u2013 but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: \u201cStacked like a packet of Rolos.\u201d Do you really need fresh herbs and spices? If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don\u2019t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. \u201cI freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,\u201d says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow\u2019s Kaleyard Cook School. Can a freezer fast-forward my cooking? In endless ways, from using cooked frozen rice in stir-fries (undercook it by 20%, make sure you cool it quickly, freeze) to making soup in minutes from frozen spinach. Freezing flavoured butters (chipotle, jerk, sriracha, lime and chilli), is a simple flavour-boosting shortcut, while Matsunaga\u2019s freezer contains various raw doughs, fresh yeast (\u201cUse it straight from the freezer\u201d) and even parathas cooked in a dry pan. \u201cThey are fantastic defrosted and fried in ghee or butter \u2013 like a fresh batch.\u201d Ramoutar makes no-cook, soft-set freezer jam (\u201cBlitz fruit, sugar and a little citrus and pop it in\u201d) and Carl Clarke, the chef-founder at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours, London, creates instant ice-cream by freezing, for example, bananas, dark chocolate, peanut butter and coconut yoghurt and combining them in a powerful, Nutribullet-style blender. If not prime cuts, can we freeze any meat? \u201cProfessionally, I\u2019m not keen,\u201d says Kerridge. Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (\u201clike fancy tartare\u201d) and bone marrow into mash, \u201clike parmesan, to add umami\u201d. Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home \u2013 \u201ccured meats work fine\u201d \u2013 and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. \u201cPacket chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,\u201d he says. Is the freezer a baker\u2019s secret weapon? It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake \u201csits in those even layers the pros get\u201d. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: \u201cIt gives you an extra-lush finish.\u201d The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: \u201cThe fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
