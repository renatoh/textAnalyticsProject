Hamid Baeidinejad said it was government policy to remain in the treaty but there were growing calls to pull out next year, when it is due for renewal, as it required Iran to make one-sided commitments. \u201cThere are views by some circles, some personalities, that Iran has not benefited from membership of the [treaty] and it is time to withdraw,\u201d he said, adding that Iran remained committed on religious grounds to not developing nuclear weapons. Iran is a founding member of the treaty, which is aimed at achieving disarmament by nuclear-armed states. Three non-signatories \u2013 Israel, India and Pakistan \u2013 have nuclear weapons. This week the Iranian government took a fourth step in reducing its adherence to its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which has been unravelling since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal last year and reimposed sanctions. Iran announced on Tuesday it was injecting uranium gas into centrifuges at its Fordow plant, a move that dramatically increases its enrichment capacity. Baeidinejad said the advocates of withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty asked why Iran should be submitting to UN atomic agency verification of its programme when other countries did not recognise Iran\u2019s right under the treaty to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The ambassador\u2019s warning about the demands of hardliners within Iran could be taken as a signal to Europe not to respond to Iran\u2019s recent actions by pulling out of the 2015 deal altogether. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said the uranium enrichment at Fordow is the most serious breach yet of the deal. France, Germany and the UK are consulting on how to respond, including whether to trigger the deal\u2019s dispute resolution mechanism, a step that could lead to a return of UN sanctions. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, showed Washington\u2019s frustration at Europe\u2019s reluctance to abandon the deal, saying in a statement: \u201cIt is now time for all nations to reject this regime\u2019s nuclear extortion and take serious steps to increase pressure. Iran\u2019s continued and numerous nuclear provocations demand such action.\u201d Baeidinejad urged Europe to do more to boost trade with Iran, even if it came at a cost, through secondary sanctions imposed by the US. \u201cWe cannot continue to implement the deal one-sidedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest measure is adopted as a warning sign that we are in a crisis. Our aim and objective is to implement the nuclear deal and not to lead to its collapse.\u201d He said it was not a good message for Europe to tell the rest of the international community that \u201cwe do not have control over our trade, economy and national security policies and cannot implement our policies due to the US.\u201d He said it was \u201cagreed policy at the highest level\u201d to reduce Iranian commitments under the deal every two months, implying that Iran could have made as many as 10 steps away from the deal by the time of the next US presidential election in November 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
