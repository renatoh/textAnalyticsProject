The Townhouse Hotel is a stone's throw from the surf, and checking in, I immediately felt very Miami Beach. The hotel name is a misleading one, however, and the rooms are bright white and about as urban as a sand dune. Quirky touches such as in-room beachballs, coupled with a decor that oozes seashore chic, make them feel like the most comfortable beach hut you've ever seen. All that's missing is a hammock. Later, in the hotel's chi-chi basement sushi bar, Bond Street, I learn that the area is currently an A-list celebrity magnet. The locals, though, have a relaxed attitude to the many stars that apparently wander among them. The manager blithely mentions that Ricky Martin is a \"once a weeker\" and though the Latino pop idol proves elusive, I do get to share table space with Boris Becker's elbows, so I don't feel too disappointed. Art deco walking tours are a popular activity, and the next day I discover that the district is compact enough to saunter around and soak up some of the finer period details. My guide, George Neary, explains the character of the locale: \"What you're seeing is actually a wide range of styles. Starting with the Mediterranean revival of the 1920s, through the art deco of the 30s and 40s, to the modernism of the 50s.\" The buildings are all pastel shades and sleek curves, and even newer constructions such as a recently built post office, are legally bound to visual assimilation. Art deco trademarks include sculptured panels, porthole windows and lashings of neon. The apparent uniformity is deceptive, though, and the district in fact showcases a litany of design movements, taking in streamline moderne, stripped classical, depression moderne, de Stijl and Bauhaus. Thankfully, the collective term for this spectrum of Miami modernism is abbreviated to the handy bite-size adjective, MiMo. Over lunch, George tells me about the demographic make-up of the area: \"It's mostly Latino, Jewish and gay. With maybe one gay Latino Jew somewhere.\" The Latin component is easily the most visible, though, through the Cubans and South Americans who have made South Beach their home. The local artistic leanings have been developed with the annual hosting of Art Basel Miami Beach. Each December, 175 leading art galleries exhibit works by over 1,000 artists in this American sister event of Art Basel Switzerland, the most important annual art show in the world. This kind of highbrow event may seem incongruous in a seaside resort, but it's a town founded on appreciation for the finer things in life. Along those very lines, the new Ritz Carlton Hotel is the latest big player to open up on South Beach. At the prestigious 1 Lincoln Road address, it's a complete restoration of the historic DiLido Hotel, once the louche hub of South Beach living. The hotel is replete with elegant artworks from collector and hotel co-owner Diana Lowenstein, with period pieces hung around the lobby and restaurants. The style is pitched as \"nautical moderne\", and there is more than a hint of ocean liner decadence about the place. The real highlight, though, is the poolside area, which has the kind of upbeat 1920s lido sophistication that demands you have a cocktail to hand as well as your trunks. They even have nightly water ballet displays, where synchronised aquatic flappers Charleston their way into the pool. But the high density of hotel competition means that indulgence needn't mean high society prices. There's a private path down to the beach, where locals mingle with tourists on the relaxed ocean front. Despite the numbers that flock to what is perhaps the most famous beach in the country, there 's room enough for everyone to take that tanning to competitive levels. If you're suffering from bikini fatigue after a long stretch in the sun, the Wolfsonian Institute (1001 Washington Avenue) is a suitably intellectual sanctuary to recharge your cultural batteries. It was founded in 1986 to preserve the eclectic collection of Michael Wolfson Jr, a magpie's nest of over 100,000 pieces that document the historical influence of design on society. It's a fascinating collection of posters, artwork and household accessories, that analyses the sociological and political implications of art, mass production and decoration. A neighbouring hotel that also has design on its mind is the Clinton. A boutique affair that bypasses the formality of the Ritz, it instead settles effortlessly into the laid-back glamour of the local neighbourhood. Private balconies, in-room Jacuzzis and a suave terrace area conjure up a spirit of evolved hedonism. South Beach nightlife is a high-octane contrast to lazy days spent admiring buildings. Expat Geordie Nick McCabe runs the local club listings website cooljunkie.com, and kindly offered to show me the velvet ropes. Each club is a symbol of conspicuous consumption, and with entry seemingly granted on the basis of good looks alone, I was grateful for such a fortunate contact. In the dazzlingly hip environs of Opium, I unwittingly upped my cool by sharing club space with J-Lo's ex-squeeze P Diddy. By sharing, I of course mean I fought for breath among the writhing hordes while he lounged about behind four lines of security in a VIP area. My last few days coincided with the Art Deco festival, an annual fundraiser aimed at preserving the unique architecture and celebrating all things MiMo. The action takes place on the famous Ocean Drive, with such iconic edifices as the Versace mansion providing the backdrop. There's all manner of arts and crafts that are, however tenuously, connected to the early 20th century, and private collections of cars from a bygone era line the street. Swing jazz hangs heavy in the air, and there's a roaring trade in beaded handbags and vintage lithographs. The concession stands are touting vermouth instead of lite beer. It's a fitting tribute to the sense of community that has developed in this coastal oddity of a neighbourhood. Local artists, retired couples, Latino DJs and musclebound sun-worshippers all seem happy to share a place that refuses to relinquish its sense of time. And if enthusiastic preservation is a Miami vice, then South Beach is guilty as charged. The perfect mix There has been an annual 'winter' music conference in Miami since the mid-1980s, but the last few years has seen an increasing number of clubbers heading for South Beach with no intention of going near the conference centre. People come to Miami to dance all day and all night to the best DJs in the world. From P Diddy to Peaches, the list of attendees reads like a who's who of dance music. The week-long festivities peak on the Saturday night with the 14-hour Ultra Music Festival (ultramusicfestival.us), which attracts 50,000 for an oceanfront beach party with 11 stages. The majority of the events happen in South Beach. Hotels in the area get booked up early - so be quick. Be careful of staying in the big hotels, establishments like the National (nationalhotel.com) might be in the centre of things, but they also host noisy - invite only - pool parties. If you're not on the list, you're not going to sleep. The Penguin Hotel (1418 Ocean Drive) is a good gathering place particularly around lunchtime. Many of the best events take place in the day so take some sun block. A good routine is: brunch, daytime party, siesta, evening meal, midnight nightclub, bed at dawn. The best event is arguably the Subliminal party at the Crobar (crobarmiami.com) featuring superstar DJ Eric Morillo. The most expensive bash is the $50 Danny Tenaglia party at Space (clubspace.com). Some say his mammoth 18-hour set is the highlight of the festival. At the very least, visit Nikki Beach (nikkibeach.com), a fantastic, open-air nightclub right on the oceanfront. The dancefloor is surrounded by four-poster beds and there is a whole circle of teepes to chill out in. Drinks are not cheap. Expect to pay at least $6 for a beer and $12 for a vodka and mixer. Best bet is to split a bottle of spirits (around $120) with your mates. The best place to keep track of it all is the excellent M3 Miami Master list (m3masterlist.com). With hundreds of parties and around a 1,000 DJs to choose from, you're spoilt for choice because Miami is the biggest dance party west of Ibiza.
