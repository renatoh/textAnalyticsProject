Among the many photographers Lassam championed was Anthony Armstrong-Jones, whose first exhibition he put on at Kodak in 1957. Lassam remained friends with Armstrong-Jones, who, as Lord Snowdon, is said to have enjoyed the anonymity of being driven around London by Lassam in his small car. Patrick Lichfield, Don McCullin, Terence Donovan, Cecil Beaton, Linda McCartney and Angus McBean were others that received his encouragement. Lassam was not a brilliant photographer, but he had an eye for talent and a belief that photography was an important means of communication as well as an important art form. In his quiet and charming way he convinced many people of its value, even on one occasion, in the late 1960s, firmly but politely reminding the then director of the Victoria and Albert museum, Sir John Pope-Hennessy, of the importance of Henri Cartier-Bresson. Born in Harrow, Lassam, the eldest son of two school teachers, was educated at Vaughan Road primary school and Harrow grammar school. In 1932 he became a trainee chemist at Kodak's Harrow factory, gaining his Institute of Chemistry certificate in 1938. That year he took a first class City and Guilds photography diploma and became an associate of the Royal Photographic Society. In 1940 he joined the RAF, concentrating on aerial photography. It was in the RAF that his involvement with the display of photography began, when he joined a Battle of Britain photographic exhibition touring north- east England. After the war, back at Kodak, he started training in industrial radiography, but soon transferred to the display services department. There he gained responsibility for Kodak House exhibitions in London's Kingsway and in the windows of its flagship Regent Street shop. The aim was to promote the firm's products: Lassam realised that since most leading photographers had accounts, by inviting them to exhibit he linked their names with Kodak. Lassam also invited celebrities such as Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Roy Strong and the Countess of Harewood to open his exhibitions, thus ensuring good publicity. He retired from Kodak at the age of 61, and was then asked by the National Trust to be the first curator of the Fox Talbot Museum. He remained there from 1975 until 1989, having celebrated the 150th anniversary of the production of the oldest existing negative, Fox Talbot's, The Oriel Window, Lacock, produced in August 1835. He loved Lacock and worked tirelessly to promote the work of Fox Talbot and the museum. Alongside the 19th-century masters, Lassam continued to display contemporary photographers. His personal collection of photographs, some saved from a skip when Kodak was having a clear-out, never received his full attention. His wish was that it should go to an educational establishment and the search is on for an appropriate home. Lassam was a natural gentleman and a good listener. He was the first person through the door when I opened a gallery in Bath in 1995. Into his 80s he attended exhibition openings, photographing artists and friends; his films, much to his pleasure, being developed free of charge by Kodak. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1981 and an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1982. In the same year he was awarded the Marquis de Savarte medal for work in the advancement of photographic history. Lassam married Margaret Perry, a civil servant, in 1944. She survives him along with their two daughters. \u00b7 Robert Errington Lassam, photography curator, born March 19 1914; died April 17 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
