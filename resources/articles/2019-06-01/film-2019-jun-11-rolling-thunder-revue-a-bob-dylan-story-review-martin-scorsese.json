The film is about Dylan\u2019s Rolling Thunder Revue show of US and Canada in 1975 \u2013 a 57-date tour in which the troubadour appeared in whiteface makeup, with an extraordinary changing list of support acts that included Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Roger McGuinn, Ronee Blakley, \u201cRamblin\u2019\u201d Jack Elliott, Bob Neuwirth and the violinist Scarlet Rivera. And these weren\u2019t massive arenas he was playing, they were little halls and venues, with publicity sometimes limited to flyers handed out on the day to astonished denizens of the little towns in which the Ken Kesey-style tour bus would cheerfully roll up with the grinning Dylan at the wheel. Try to imagine it happening now. What was it like for Dylan to be spearheading this event, a kind of musical rumour meandering through an America that was just recovering from the mortification of Watergate and gearing itself up as best it could for its bicentennial celebrations? \u201cIt was so long ago I wasn\u2019t even born,\u201d says the wry Dylan now with a shrug, and his interviewee appearances are all very funny, that voice as dry as prairie grass. The film does not quite wish to tell you what it was like in any obvious way. There is something weird and mischievous going on. The concert footage and backstage scenes appear to be drawn from the same trove of archive material that formed the basis of Bob Dylan\u2019s lengthy and ill-fated 1978 film about the tour, Renaldo and Clara, which he co-wrote with the late Sam Shepard \u2013 who is interviewed here. Like that film, the Rolling Thunder Revue does have some personae who may not be, strictly speaking, factual. The footage is attributed to a certain dyspeptic film-maker who is actually the performance artist and comedian Martin Von Haselberg, husband of Bette Midler. A certain politician is interviewed and you may think: \u201cWait, that guy looks like the actor Michael Murphy.\u201d It is the actor Michael Murphy. Could it be that this is all a modern commedia dell\u2019arte in which, with Scorsese\u2019s discreet assistance, Dylan is retreating behind masks, masks that might allow him to tell a higher truth? Possibly. Scorsese drops further hints with clips from films concerned in various ways with theatrical performance: Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s The Vanishing Lady (1893), Marcel Carn\u00e9\u2019s Children of Paradise (1945) and Tony Gatlif\u2019s Latcho Drom (1993). Sometimes the creative semi-remembering is a bit opaque, and there were times when I could have done with some more straightforward documentary realism. But it\u2019s churlish to complain when this is all so gripping, both as a time capsule and as a showcase for Dylan\u2019s unique presence and glorious performances from Baez, Mitchell and also from Patti Smith who was not actually a member of the Rolling Thunder tour but is shown performing before it got started. Allen Ginsberg is another intensely 70s figure shown here on tour, at once egotistical and yet deferring utterly to Dylan\u2019s majestic importance. There is a great interview with Sharon Stone, who appears to have gone briefly on tour with Rolling Thunder as a young woman and is (delicately) interviewed about her experiences \u2013 including bursting into tears when she discovered that Bob Dylan\u2019s Just Like a Woman was not, despite what he\u2019d caddishly told Stone, based on her. Could it be that she was not the only young female fellow traveller on whom Bob used that line? The emotional centre of the film is Dylan\u2019s protest song Hurricane, about the boxer Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Carter who was falsely imprisoned for murder. That song, and the Rolling Thunder tour, were an important part of the momentum that overturned Carter\u2019s conviction \u2013 though he would not be finally released for another 10 years. This is an immersive experience, like being plunged back into the 70s. There is passion there. No matter how chaotic or bleary things get, no one is in any doubt that the music counts. \u2022This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Roger McGuinn\u2019s surname."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
