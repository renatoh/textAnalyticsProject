HP's sales were $17.3 billion: up by 5% \"but $200 million shy of Wall Street estimates\", according to USA Today. \"HP's PC division lost $56 million in the quarter.\" On Wednesday, \"Dell cut prices on computers, printers and other products by up to 22%,\" as Reuters reported. The timing of the release was \"serendipitous,\" a Dell spokeswoman said. Comment: Dell is (very roughly) half the size of HP, but it is in a position of strength, with profits up 24% and shipments up 27% in the last quarter (below). HP can now choose between cutting PC prices and losing even more money, or holding them and losing market share."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
