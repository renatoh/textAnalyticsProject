Some might call it purgatory but not Dario Gradi. He was appointed manager of Crewe Alexandra in 1983 and tonight takes charge of the First Division team for his 1,000th match, at Norwich. \"It's just a figure. The significant thing is that I've been given time to build a club as well as a team. That's been very fulfilling.\" It is an experience few managers ever get to enjoy. More than 20 have already left their jobs this season. Hastiness is the middle name of most club chairman. Gradi experienced that side of the game. \"At Crystal Palace I asked the chairman [Ron Noades] what he expected. He told me we were going to get relegated, that we would have to sell a few players and that he wanted the club in the top half of the table the next season. Palace were ninth when he sacked me.\" Gradi, 60 years old this summer but easily able to pass for a man 10 years younger, made sure he knew the parameters when he joined Crewe, then in the old Fourth Division and having had seven managers in 10 years. \"If they had said they wanted promotion I would not have taken the job.\" Six years later Crewe were promoted. Not that he ever envisaged still being at Gresty Road. \"It was a dump. I used to come with Wimbledon. We came by train and walked round to the ground. There was an old corrugated tin fence with holes at the bottom and ashes spilling on to the road. And there was a fence made out of old railway sleepers that was falling over. The physio and I couldn't go into the dressing room at the same time, it was so small. I said to the Wimbledon players: 'If you don't play properly, you'll end up at a club like this.'\" The bespectacled Gradi, never lost for words, and his timing honed by a hundred interviews this week for television, radio and newspapers, paused for dramatic effect: \"I ended up here.\" And so the legend began, with Gradi producing quality players including, among the most recent, Liverpool's Danny Murphy. \"He thought he was a bit better than he was. I said: 'I don't want you as you are, but if you want to stay you can.' He just grinned. But he worked hard.\" So did Seth Johnson, now with Leeds, when Gradi persuaded his parents that he should come to Crewe at 14. \"Now he's just bought his mum a house.\" Most of the transfer money has been spent on facilities,including a spacious training ground in Nantwich. The club is both secure and ambitious, while Gradi, a director, gets a cut of the transfer fees - \"an end-of-year commission. It's the only way they can afford to pay me.\" Crewe, under Gradi and an astute board, have defied the odds. \"You would think there would be a lot of teams, less organised than us, who would need to go part-time. But the chairman was saying that to me 18 years ago. Now we have seven Conference clubs that are full-time. Common sense tells you it can't go on but history tells you different.\" Clearly he knows his own worth, but there are no egos at Crewe. \"You can't get big-headed here,\" said Gradi, who in his 18 years has never knowingly been threatened with the sack. \"One year we went 13 matches without winning. I didn't do anything different but with the same players we won 10 of the next 11. Why should that be? God knows.\" Realism reigns and Gradi's contract runs until 2006. A thousand more matches then? \"No chance.\" But he would probably settle for 500.
