Lightbourne\u2019s playing career began on the island in the late 80s and ended there in 2009 \u2013 in between he had a solid career in England \u2013 and he has been managing ever since. Bermuda\u2019s debut in this month\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup would be the culmination of his life\u2019s work, except his ambitions go further. \u201cI always believed that anything that is given to us is easy but the things that you work for are harder and you appreciate them more,\u201d Lightbourne tells the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019ve lived my life, I\u2019ve had to work to get whatever I\u2019ve achieved and that\u2019s what I want the team to work for and believe that we belong at this level.\u201d Bermuda, with a population of just over 65,000, will be the smallest nation outside of Oceania to ever compete in a senior men\u2019s Confederation championship. That figure is smaller than combined capacities of the three stadiums it will play in during the group stage. Though the country has less than one-fifth the population of Iceland, Bermudan FA resident Mark Wade said he thinks the program can follow in Iceland\u2019s footsteps and use the Gold Cup as a starting point for an eventual berth in the World Cup. \u201cI\u2019m expecting us to learn a lot about ourselves and I\u2019m certainly expecting us to do well in the tournament,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThe boys here in training camp in Bermuda are buzzing and they want to challenge themselves against Costa Rica who made the World Cup, and that\u2019s something that they want to do.\u201d Wade is betting on Fifa to finalize a 48-team World Cup for the 2026 tournament co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. Bermuda open the Gold Cup against Haiti before facing Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and a potential meeting with Mexico if they make the quarter-finals. The coming games are a chance for Bermuda\u2019s players, many of whom play their domestic soccer on the island, to showcase their talents to international scouts. \u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for players and we\u2019ve spoken to them about it,\u201d Lightbourne says. \u201cWe have a lot of players who have a lot of potential. They know that and this is the opportunity for them to show it.\u201d Bermuda\u2019s success so far comes from its total integration of national teams from youth to senior levels. The island is smaller than Manhattan, so Lightbourne says it is easy for players to come together and train every week. As a result, the FA has all its young players train together for six months before choosing the teams to compete in summer tournaments. Senior coaches train U-20 and U-17 players and exceptional young players get called up to the senior team well before they turn 21. One example is Zeiko Lewis. The attacking midfielder began training at the national program at the Under 13 level and made his senior debut before turning 17. Lewis moved to the US and enjoyed a successful career at Boston College becoming the school\u2019s all-time assists leader before getting drafted by the New York Red Bulls in 2017. Now with the Charleston Battery of the USL Championship, Lewis says he hopes young players can follow in his footsteps. \u201cI went to America to show that you can get your degree and play professionally even to show that if you don\u2019t want to play professionally, you can at least get a degree,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of kids who used to shy away from that because they had to leave the island and they ended up getting trapped in and staying on the island, being in a comfort zone and having your friends stay there.\u201d Although violent crime remains low on the island, Bermuda has seen rises in petty crime and small gang activity. Firearm offenses have risen, according to Bermuda Police Service statistics, as have thefts. The Pan-American Health Organization noted antisocial behavior as a challenge and the island\u2019s health service has been criticized for not conducting adequate research into mental health concerns amongst the population. \u201cSome people get lost into violence and gangs but at the end of the day, we\u2019re showing them that there\u2019s a brighter path for them to go on,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cEspecially being in small country, where you basically know everybody, and you begin to feel like that most of the world doesn\u2019t care about Bermudians and that \u2018I\u2019m not going to get my chance\u2019.\u201d Bermuda has a history of producing successful players. Clyde Best\u2019s career with West Ham in the 60s and 70s is the best example but Zeiko\u2019s grandfather Fred also played in the original North American Soccer League. Lightbourne, meanwhile, played for nine different teams in the UK and his striker, Nahki Wells, is contracted with Burnley. Promising attacking midfielder Kane Crichlow just signed with Watford. \u201cBermuda over the years has traditionally produced good players but we haven\u2019t produced good teams,\u201d Lightbourne said. \u201cWe want to change that mindset and we have a lot of young players getting a lot of good coaching at a young age overseas so we want to make the national team available to them as soon as they come of age so that we can stay in contact with them and keep building our program. All of our players who play for Bermuda were Bermudian born. It\u2019s not like their parents or grandparents were Bermudian, they\u2019ve all played in Bermuda at some point in their career and in our leagues.\u201d With Concacaf Nations League games providing the opportunity for Bermuda\u2019s full-strength squad to play together more often, a stronger sense of cohesion exists with the players. Wells was among a handful of European-based players who were able to rejoin the national team for portions of qualifying and he scored in both of the games he played. \u201cIt might take a day or two for us to readjust to how some of us have changed our playing styles because of the different places we\u2019ve gone but we all know the system and we know essentially how we were brought up and where we come from,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWe have a basic background of who we are and who each individual is and we\u2019re all really good friends so that helps us a lot. The connection is always there.\u201d Those ties were tested after Bermuda lost their first Nations League qualifying game to Aruba. The loss prompted the team to hold a meeting, and Lewis says players were able to be frank with each other about their shortcomings because of the experience and camaraderie they had built up over the years. After that loss, Bermuda went to win their next three games by a combined score of 16\u20131. Those bonds will face the stress of tournament play and Lewis said they\u2019re ready. \u201cWe have a saying \u2018we are Bermudians\u2019 so it has helped us grow a lot being small. Our entire lives have always been us against the world. We\u2019ve always heard how we come from a small country and not have much to produce so when we come out on a big stage, we\u2019re going to show that although we\u2019re small, we have a lot of heart and we\u2019re mighty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
