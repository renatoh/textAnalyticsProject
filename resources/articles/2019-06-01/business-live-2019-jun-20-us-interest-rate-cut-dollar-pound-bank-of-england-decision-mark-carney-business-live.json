With his reelection bid in, low oil, and gas prices at the pump, seems to be Trump\u2019s primary concern. That\u2019s why he\u2019s even suggested being open to making peace with Tehran, despite the continued noises against Iran by some in his administration.\u201d Boom! Hopes that US interest rates will be cut next month have sent Wall Street to a new all-time closing high. The S&amp;P 500 has ended the day up 28 points at 2,954, a gain of 0.9%, following yesterday\u2019s dovish performance by the Federal Reserve. The Dow and the Nasdaq also gained around 0.9%, to finish close to their own highest levels. Predictions that the Fed will deliver on its pledge to act appropriately by cutting borrowing costs at its July meeting have helped investors ignore the threat of military action in the Gulf -- while energy companies obviously benefited from the jump in crude prices. Goodnight! GW US oil prices have now posted their biggest one-day gain in five months. Donald Trump\u2019s warning that Iran has made a \u201cvery big mistake\u201d by shooting down one of America\u2019s RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones has loomed over energy markets today. Here\u2019s Marketwatch\u2019s take: Language from Trump \u201chas driven up oil as traders fear supply in the Middle East might be squeezed by Washington D.C. potentially taking a tougher stance on the country,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. July West Texas Intermediate oil CLN19, +5.80% rose $2.89, or 5.4%, to settle at $56.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the highest front-month contract finish since late May and biggest one-day dollar and percentage gain since December, according to Dow Jones Market Data. This, however, might be reassuring... This won\u2019t calm nerves in the oil market: Are investors getting carried away by the prospect of a US interest rate cut? They should remember that central bankers are becoming more cautious because the global economy looks weaker - not really a cause of jubilation. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com reckons the rally could \u201cturn to despair\u201d once markets have digested the situation. He points out: Rates are being cut because the global economy is, or perceived to be, slowing down amid the escalation of geopolitical risks. With global interest rates already so low, how much of a boost would the economy get from (the promise of) a 25 or 50 basis point reduction in interest rates? Granted, it will increase the marginal supply of cheap credit further, but that is not the issue here; it is all about marginal demand, or lack thereof, for cheap loans from consumers and businesses because of the latest or upcoming interest rate cuts. I think the law of diminishing returns apply here. Also, with central banks keeping rates so low for such a long period of time, what will happen if the economy were to deteriorate even further? Will the Fed and other central banks have any more monetary policy tools left at their disposals then? And what about a situation where we see a sudden economic recovery or a big jump in inflation? Surely in this event, central banks will have to tighten their belts quickly, potentially choking off growth. It\u2019s important to remember that while Washington and Tehran agree that an American spy drone has been shot down by Iranian forces, they don\u2019t agree on where it was flying at the time. Iranian media said the aircraft was hit inside Iranian airspace, near Kuh Mobarak, on Iran\u2019s southern coast. The US say the Global Hawk drone was flying in international airspace when it was shot down by an Iranian missile over the Strait of Hormuz. Navy Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, insists: \u201cIranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false. This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace.\u201d But Ali Shamkhani, secretary for the Supreme National Security Council, is just as adamant that the aircraft had breached Iranian borders, saying: \u201cWe will defend Iran\u2019s airspace and maritime boundaries with all our might. It doesn\u2019t matter which country\u2019s aircraft cross our airspace.\u201d Such talk is raising concerns of military conflict in the Middle East, which would cause oil supply disruption. That\u2019s why oil prices are pushing sharply higher this afternoon: US crude: up 5.8% at $59.91 per barrel, a three-week high Brent crude: up 4.3% at $64.52 per barrel, also a three week high And here\u2019s our latest news story on the incident: US crude oil is now up nearly 6%, on fears of disruption in the Gulf. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbelligerent\u201d tweet accusing Iran of a \u2018big mistake\u2019 is driving oil up. Oil has extended gains on this response from the White House, which sounds quite belligerent. West Texas Intermediate is up 5% to 56.76, while Brent has broken up above $64. Oil has risen to its best in three weeks and now looks to have moved out of its bottoming formation. Oil is on track for its biggest daily rally in five months, driven by concerns that the US and Iran could be heading for military conflict. Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that Iran made \u201ca very big mistake\u201d by shooting down a US military drone overnight. That has send the oil price soaring even higher. US crude is now up 4.5% today at over $56 per barrel, its highest level since 30 May. Nearly every one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are up too. The top riser is Nike (+2.45%), followed by several tech firms including Cisco (+2%) and IBM (+1.7%). JP Morgan, though, is a rare faller - down 0.4%. Lower interest rates aren\u2019t good news for banks, as they erode the profit margin between borrowers and savers. President Donald Trump is excited by today\u2019s Wall Street action: With the re-election campaign kicking off, the president will use the stock market as proof that he\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019ll also take the credit, pointing to his campaign to force the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates and start cutting (as they may do next month). Every sector of the US stock markets has risen today, helping to drive the S&amp;P to today\u2019s new all-time peak. Energy stocks are leading the rally, up 1.8%, followed by technology (+1.34%), miners (+1.2%), healthcare (+1%) and industrial companies (+1%). As explained in the introduction to today\u2019s blog, investors are bullish today because America\u2019s top central banker has turned more dovish. Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters last night that \u201cThe case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,\u201d and that his committee wanted to see more economic data before making their next move. The Fed also dropped its pledge to be \u201cpatient\u201d, replacing it with a promise to take appropriate action to protect the economy (which is being interpreted as protecting the stock market too). So traders now reckon a July rate cut is hammered down, the only question is whether it\u2019s a small cut or a big one. Boom! Wall Street has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading in New York. The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped to 2,599 points, it\u2019s highest ever intra-day level. Investors are piling into shares following yesterday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, when America\u2019s central bank dropped loud hints that it will cut interest rates this year -- probably starting next month. Wall Street has concluded that the Fed will do whatever it takes to maintain the current rally -- focusing on markets, rather than on inflation and unemployment. That will fuel concerns that we could be in a stock market bubble -- but anyone whose been been holding onto cash this year rather than stocks and bonds has missed out! Here\u2019s the opening prices: Dow Jones industrial average: up 253 points or 0.96% at 26,757 S&amp;P 500: up 28 points or 0.99% at 2,955 points. Nasdaq: up 92 points or 1.16% at 8,079 points. Having read the Bank of England minutes, Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics reckons the Monetary Policy Committee is more worried that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal. He writes: Clearly the weaker economic news has played its part in causing the MPC\u2019s dovish shift, but there are also signs that the Committee is becoming more concerned about the possibility of a no deal Brexit. Indeed, instead of chastising the market for underestimating how much interest rates might rise as it did in May, the MPC pointed out \u201cthe ongoing tension between the MPC\u2019s forecast\u2026 of a smooth Brexit and the assumptions about alternative Brexit scenarios that were priced into financial market variables\u201d. The minutes are online here. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision: The Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at 0.75% on Thursday and warned that a combination of Brexit worries and global trade tensions was weighing on growth. All nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee backed the decision to not change rates. There had been some expectations in the markets that a couple of them could vote for an increase because of concerns that rising wages will push up inflation. However, figures this week showed the annual inflation rate fell to the bank\u2019s target of 2%, easing pressure to raise rates. Also, uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union remains despite a Brexit deadline extension and are keeping a lid on growth. Only around 20% of respondents to a Bank of England survey think Brexit uncertainty will be resolved by the end of this year. Though Britain\u2019s departure date from the EU has been pushed back to Oct. 31, there is still huge uncertainty as to whether the country will leave then. The Conservative Party contest to replace Prime Minister Theresa May has meant there\u2019s been little progress on Brexit in recent months and concerns are rising that Britain could crash out without a deal on future relations with the EU. The favorite, Boris Johnson, has indicated that he\u2019s prepared to go ahead with a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit. Most economists, including those at the Bank of England, think that leaving without a deal will cause huge damage to the British economy as trade with the EU is hit by tariffs and other disruptions. \u201cDomestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen,\u201d rate-setters said in the minutes to Thursday\u2019s policy meeting. They also said that trade tensions have intensified and that economic growth is set to stall in the second quarter following a 0.5% pickup in the first three months. In its forecasts last month, the bank had projected growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. There is something slightly odd about today\u2019s minutes from the Bank of England, as it leaves interest rates on hold. On one hand, the Monetary Policy Committee sounds more concerned about Brexit (\u201cthe perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen\u201d), the economy (no growth is expected in the current quarter) and the balance of risks (\u201cdownside risks to growth have increased\u201d). And yet... they still expect to raise interest rates at a gradual pace over the next couple of years. Why hasn\u2019t the Bank\u2019s guidance changed, if the economic picture has darkened? Are they afraid to sound too gloomy, or are they simply hoping that conditions pick up? Chris Giles of the Financial Times suggests that any dissenters on the MPC aren\u2019t prepared to break cover yet. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University suspects that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in the coming months, rather than raise them. He tells me: MPC members decide on interest rates based on our economic performance as well as financial/economic policy risks. On the economic front, monthly GDP data suggests an economy which is at best weak (GDP fell by 0.4% in April) and CPI inflation is equal to the 2% target. Hence, economic front news suggests no need for an interest rate hike any time soon. If anything, economic front news points to an interest rate cut. Developments in financial and economic policy risk are currently cancelling each other. Indeed, UK financial risk (which combines information from the bond, equity, banking and foreign exchange market) remains low but economic policy risk, which largely relates to no-deal Brexit, is slightly on the rise. As we move towards the October deadline, there is a chance that both risk variables will escalate. Such a scenario will put MPC members under pressure to cut the policy rate.... Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, believes there\u2019s no chance of a UK interest rate rise until the next Brexit deadline. \u201cWith Brexit unresolved, it is now practically inconceivable that there will be a rate hike between now and October, despite GDP growth being close to potential. MPC members have been doing the rounds of late, making hawkish comments and it\u2019s easy to see why. The labour market is tight and prices are rising in sectors sensitive to the output gap, but \u2013 for now \u2013 this is being outweighed by weak goods inflation. With headline CPI on target, that\u2019s a decision for another day. \u201cUK businesses continue to be haunted by the looming Brexit deadline of October 31st and the spectre of uncertainty is weighing on activity. Even if a No Deal exit is averted for now, the cost of delay will mount if negotiations are extended once again. Consumers may receive some respite; above inflation earnings growth and continued low interest rates mean UK households have a bit more spending power, which is supporting the economy. With the end of Carney\u2019s tenure on the horizon, a rate rise might be an issue for his successor to grapple with.\u201d With summer holidays looming, the Bank\u2019s gloomy forecasts haven\u2019t helped families planning a trip across the Channel. Sterling has dropped by almost half a euro cent to \u20ac1.121, wiping out all yesterday\u2019s rally. The pound is also surrendering some of its early gains against the US dollar, and is now back below $1.27. Bad news for workers: the Bank of England\u2019s economists reckon that UK earnings growth \u201cmight have levelled off\u201d. Better news: They also predict that inflation (which fell to 2% last month) will fall further in the coming months. The nine policymakers on the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee were unanimous this month. They all agreed to leave interest rates at 0.75%, and still collectively agree that (should Brexit go smoothly) it makes sense to raise interest rates over the next couple of years. The minutes say: All members judged at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy was appropriate. The Committee continued to judge that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its May Inflation Report projections that included an assumption of a smooth Brexit, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. With Brexit now delayed until (at least) 31 October, the Bank of England fears that businesses will keep sitting on their hands rather than buy new equipment and machinery. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting state: The underlying pattern of relatively strong household consumption growth but weak business investment had persisted. Surveys suggested that companies expected uncertainty to persist at elevated levels, and there were no clear signs that investment growth would pick up ahead of the October Brexit deadline. The Bank also points to the recent shutdowns in the car industry (as manufacturers braced for a no-deal Brexit that never came). It hopes that car production will accelerate over the summer: Weakness in motor vehicle production, related to some car manufacturers\u2019 Brexit contingency plans, was likely to push down on Q2 GDP growth, but push up on Q3 growth The Bank has cut its growth forecasts due to the damage caused by Brexit worries, the unwinding of stockpiling, and by the trade conflict between the US and China. In a statement, it says: Globally, trade tensions have intensified. Domestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen. Trade concerns have contributed to volatility in global equity prices and corporate bond spreads, as well as falls in industrial metals prices. Forward interest rates in major economies have fallen materially further. Increased Brexit uncertainties have put additional downward pressure on UK forward interest rates and led to a decline in the sterling exchange rate. As expected, recent UK data have been volatile, in large part due to Brexit-related effects on financial markets and businesses. After growing by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, GDP is now expected to be flat in Q2. That in part reflects an unwind of the positive contribution to GDP in the first quarter from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks significantly ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. Ouch! The Bank of England has also lowered its growth forecast for the second quarter of 2019, to zero. It had previously forecast 0.2% growth in April-June. Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rate on hold at 0.75%. More to follow... It\u2019s nearly time for the main news of the day - the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy decision. The City is confident that the BoE will leave interest rates on hold today, at 0.75%. It probably won\u2019t make any changes to its quantitative easing programme either (which holds \u00a3435bn of mainly UK government bonds). But investors want to hear the Bank\u2019s views on Brexit, the state of the UK economy, and whether any policymakers are leaning towards an interest rate rise, or even a cut (just as America\u2019s Federal Reserve prepares to start cutting). Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, sets the scene: \u201cMarket attention turns to the bank of England in this week\u2019s central bank relay. Participants will be searching for clues from the MPC as to the future path of monetary policy, with retail sales disappointing and inflation running on target, the case for the Bank of England to follow the lead from its US counterpart is gradually building. While sterling enjoys some welcome respite after last night\u2019s dovish hold from the Fed, any dissent within the committee in favour of an interest rate cut or reference to more accommodative policy in the statement could see the pound quickly reverse its recent bout of strength against the dollar.\u201d Iran\u2019s threat of \u2018consequences\u2019 against America will fuel fears of military conflict in the Gulf region. The Strait of Hormuz handles around 20% of the world\u2019s oil (tankers from Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia\u2019s east coast all pass through on their way to the rest of the world) Economist Alastair Ross suggests markets are taking the drone shooting quite well: However, that could change if America takes a robust response to this latest incident (Donald Trump hasn\u2019t tweeted yet today....) Iran\u2019s foreign ministry has now weighed in, criticising America for illegally (it claims) violating its airspace. Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi says: \u201cAny such violations of Iran\u2019s borders are strongly condemned ... We warn of the consequences of such illegal and provocative measures.\u201d There\u2019s another reason oil is rising -- yesterday a rocket hit an Iraqi compound housing several international oil companies, including the US multinational ExxonMobil. That has heightened concerns that oil shipments from the Middle East could be disrupted. Crude oil prices have jumped sharply after Iran shot down a US spy drone, further straining relations between the two countries. US crude oil has surged by around 3% today to $55.53 per barrel, its highest level since the end of May. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has also rallied, touching $63.88 per barrel for the first time since 10th June. The rally comes as Iran accused Washington of breaching its national sovereignty, after shooting down an unmanned US drone. According to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the drone was flying in Iranian airspace, near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan, when it was shot. The US military, though, says its drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. This incident comes just a week after the US accused Iran of attacking two tankers in the nearby Gulf of Oman, Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour expains: Both Washington and Tehran insist they are intent on avoiding a war as tensions build over the consequences of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, but fears that an accidental chain of events will lead to escalation and finally a military confrontation are growing. The shooting down of the drone came as the US president, Donald Trump, was briefed on the details of a separate incident: a further missile strike in Saudi Arabia that appeared to come from Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said on Wednesday in relation to the Saudi missile strike: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and continuing to consult with our partners and allies.\u201d More here: Just in: UK retail sales fell in May, as the poor weather deterred people from buying new clothes. Shoppers bought 0.5% less stuff in May than in April, the Office for National Statistics reports, with the amount spent dropping by 0.3%. Britain suffered some rather cold weather last month, with the May Bank Holiday particularly inclement. This appears to have hit clothing sales, which slumped by 4.5% month-on-month, the ninth monthly decline in a row. The ONS says: Evidence from retailers suggested that the poor weather may have delayed the sales for summer ranges. Department stores are also struggling, with sales down again. Some traders reckon America\u2019s central bank could pull out its bazooka next month, and slash US interest rates by a chunky 50 basis points. That would be a serious reversal of its recent policy of raising interest rates, and suggest it is worried about growth prospects. Newsflash: Norway\u2019s central bank has defied the prevailing mood by raising interest rates. The Norges Bank voted to hike borrowing costs from 1% to 1.25%, in response to rising underlying inflation and solid growth. But.... it also acknowledges that other central banks are moving towards cutting rates. The upturn in the Norwegian economy appears to be a little stronger the coming year than projected earlier. On the other hand, there are prospects for weaker external growth and lower foreign interest rates. Retail analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien of GlobalData says Dixons Carphone isn\u2019t keeping up with a fast-moving mobile market: The FT\u2019s Cat Rutter Pooley says the company has disappointed the City: Far more galling for investors is the downgrade to expectations for the coming year. While the statutory pre-tax loss for the year to April was \u00a3259m, its \u201cheadline\u201d pre-tax number was a profit of \u00a3298m. In the new financial year, headline pre-tax profits are set to dip to \u00a3210m. Analysts had expected them to hold flat. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the mobile phone division is dragging the rest of Dixons Carphone back: The mobile business in particular is on life support, draining capital and resources prior to its integration with the electricals business. The rapidly evolving nature of this segment has threatened to leave Dixons behind and thus, as a matter of urgency, the company has renegotiated its network contracts, although such benefits will take time to wash through. Elsewhere, tepid group revenue growth, lower free cash flow, higher net debt and a previously slashed dividend are far from being cause for celebration. There are some glimmers of hope, however. The electricals part of the business, particularly in the UK and Ireland, is holding its own in terms of revenue and is also seeing market share growth. Ouch! Shares in UK electronics retailer Dixons Carphone have plunged by a quarter in early trading. Dixons Carphone has shocked the City by warning that its UK mobile business will be \u201csignificantly loss making this year\u201d, as it struggles to persuade customers to upgrade their phones. It also posted a statutory pre-tax loss of \u00a3259m for the last financial year, down from a profit of \u00a3289m in 2017-18. Alarmingly for investors, the firm only expects to post profits of around \u00a3210m this financial year; analysts had been expecting a figure of about \u00a3296m. Mobile is a major part of the company\u2019s business, but it could take two years before it breaks even! CEO Alex Baldock warned: In UK mobile, the market is changing in the way we described in December, but doing so faster. So, we\u2019re moving faster to respond: we\u2019ve renegotiated all our legacy network contracts, we\u2019re developing our new customer offer, and are accelerating the integration of Mobile and Electricals into one business. This means taking more pain in the coming year, when Mobile will make a significant loss. Stock markets around the globe are also rallying today, thanks to the prospect that America\u2019s interest rates could be cut next month. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 30 points, or 0.4%, with European indices also rallying. That follows a strong session in Asia, where China\u2019s CSI 300 surged by 3% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.6%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the Fed\u2019s dovish twist is driving shares up. We all know that central banks have been data dependent, but it is only now that they have started to acknowledge the weakness in the economic numbers. Last night, the Fed lowered its inflation forecast from 1.8% to 1.5% but , there wasn\u2019t any change in the growth forecast. The reason that the event was dovish came from fact that the Fed\u2019s outlook of the economy isn\u2019t positive; they said the global uncertainties are increasing. They feel it is time to shift the needle of the their monetary policy to spur the growth again or at least not letting the global economy go off the rails. The tantalising scent of a US rate cut is lifting the pound away from the five-month low of $1.2504 struck on Tuesday. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says it\u2019s \u201cquite a chunky move\u201d, helped by the prospect that UK interest rates could be raised in the coming months: Maybe the prospect of a more hawkish Bank of England is helping the pound. At least Mark Carney doesn\u2019t have to deal with a political leader on his case\u2026 Well, not yet anyway. Even so, political uncertainty is still weighing on sterling, Wilson adds: The prospect of Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the EU come October 31st is a risk. There\u2019s now talk of a possible general election if he gets in \u2013 risky, we know what happened to Theresa May. The prospect of a general election would not do anything to remove uncertainty around UK assets. Zero clarity still. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is weakening this morning after America\u2019s central bankers dropped a loud hint that they will cut interest rates soon. Last night the Federal Reserve left borrowing costs unchanged, but also revealed that almost every policymaker expects at least one rate cut before the end of 2019. With inflation low, growth slowing, and Donald Trump dropping loud and unsubtle hints, the Fed is now preparing to reverse some of last year\u2019s rate hikes. It adjusted its guidance to the markets, dropping its promise to be patient. Instead, the Fed will \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion\u201d and to \u201cclosely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters that his FOMC committee wanted a bit more information before acting. He told a press conference: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see if these risks continue to weigh on the outlook. We want to see and we want to react to trends that are sustained, that are genuine.\u201d The markets now reckon this means the Fed is certain to cut its benchmark rate, currently 2.25%-2.5%, at its next meeting in late July. This has, predictably, hurt the US dollar. This has lifted the pound back over $1.27 for the first time in a week, reversing this week\u2019s Brexit-induced losses. Also coming up today Two other central banks will seize the limelight from the Fed. The European Central Bank releases its latest economic bulletin, two days after its president, Mario Draghi, hinted that it implement more stimulus measures. Then at noon UK time, the Bank of England will set interest rates. We\u2019re not expecting any changes, but the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting will show the BoE\u2019s thinking.
