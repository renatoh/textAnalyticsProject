Chanting \u201ccommunists are murderers\u201d and \u201cwe have had enough\u201d, protesters held sheets of paper rolled up to resemble police batons in an expression of indignation over the installation of Zden\u011bk Ondr\u00e1\u010dek, a Czech Communist party MP, as chair of the parliament\u2019s general inspection of security forces commission. The choice of Ondr\u00e1\u010dek to head a sensitive committee overseeing police wrongdoing was confirmed in a parliamentary vote last week despite objections that he had served in a unit that beat up pro-democracy demonstrators in the 1989 Velvet Revolution before the fall of communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. Monday\u2019s protest coincided with simultaneous demonstrations in 10 other Czech cities and towns, including the second largest city, Brno. Protesters congregating in Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square \u2013 scene of the 1989 mass demonstrations that triggered the downfall of the former communist regime \u2013 focused their anger on prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161, who is accused of facilitating Ondr\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s appointment in exchange for the support of 15 Communist party MPs for a government led by his ANO party, which is the biggest grouping in parliament but lacks sufficient numbers to form a majority. Some said they feared for the future of democracy in the Czech Republic. \u201cWe feel democracy is under threat,\u201d said Iva Vrbova, 53, a company manager who recalled taking part in the 1989 gatherings. \u201cI stood here in the streets in 1989 and here we are again in exactly the same place \u2013 and for the same reason. \u201cHe [Ondr\u00e1\u010dek] is a man who beat ordinary people in the streets and now he wants to check and control police power in the Czech Republic. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d Michal Mares, 58, a financial analyst and another veteran of the 1989 protests, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting situation. Democracy is moving backwards, that\u2019s why we are here.\u201d There were signs that the show of people power could force a U-turn. Babi\u0161 \u2013 who himself has been identified as a secret police informer during the communist period, despite his denials \u2013 said he would push to have Ondr\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s appointment overturned, drawing criticism that he was merely bowing to public sentiment. The controversy has coincided with the 70th anniversary of the communists\u2019 seizure of sole power in Czechoslovakia in a coup that pushed the other parties in the coalition government out of office. Ondra\u010dek has been defended by the current Communist party leader, Vojt\u011bch Filip, who said his fellow MP \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d in fulfilling his police duties to suppress demonstrations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
