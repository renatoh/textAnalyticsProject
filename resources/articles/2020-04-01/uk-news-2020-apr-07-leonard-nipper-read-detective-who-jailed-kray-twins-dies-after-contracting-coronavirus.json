Leonard \u201cNipper\u201d Read died aged 95, after a short illness. Read led the investigation that saw Ronnie and Reggie Kray jailed for murder in 1969, ending their pre-eminence in London\u2019s organised crime scene of the 1960s. His brother-in-law Dave Allen, also a former Metropolitan police officer, said that Read had been admitted to hospital for treatment on his foot and told the Guardian: \u201cWhen he went in they were treating him for an infection to his foot. It\u2019s only later he had the coronavirus \u2026 The doctors confirmed to his family that\u2019s what got him in the end.\u201d Read\u2019s nickname of \u201cNipper\u201d referred to his relatively diminutive height, which did not stop him from having a distinguished career in policing and a keen interest in boxing. Read was born in Nottingham in 1925 and left school aged 14. He served in the Royal Navy during the war and after leaving joined the Metropolitan police in 1947. He rose through the ranks to become part of the team solving the Great Train Robbery in 1963, and the following year was transferred to the Kray case. He was promoted to detective chief superintendent in 1967, and was then posted to Scotland Yard\u2019s murder squad, where he led the investigation into the brutal East End gang that netted the twins a fortune and allowed them to live a life of luxury. Their ruthless hold was hidden by their fame and Read himself feared that corrupt officers helped them stay ahead of the law. The bloody reign of the gangsters known as \u201cthe firm\u201d ended in 1969 when they were both jailed for murder. Ronnie, the elder of the twins by 45 minutes, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the murder of George Cornell, while Reggie was locked up for the murder of Jack \u201cthe Hat\u201d McVitie. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment. The extraordinary trial saw evidence of the brothers\u2019 fascination with killing including a \u201chide attache case [that] was fitted up with clips and springs to hold a hypodermic needle that could be released by a cord to inject a dose of hydrogen cyanide through a hole in the side when swung against someone\u2019s leg\u201d, one report at the time related. Read wrote two books that featured the pursuit of the Krays and in the 2015 movie about the notorious twins Read was played by the actor Christopher Eccleston. Allen said of his brother-in-law: \u201cHe\u2019s up there with the best of them. At a time when there was so much corruption he had nothing to do with that and stood up against it.\u201d In a tweet, the Met police\u2019s heritage centre said: \u201cWe are sad to announce that Leonard \u201cNipper\u201d Read QPM died this morning aged 95. A Met legend, he is best known for his part in bringing the Kray Twins to justice.\u201d After leaving policing his life long love of boxing saw him end up as chair and then president of the British Boxing Board of Control. He was a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Police Medal. The British Boxing Board of Control, which he used to chair, called him a \u201cwonderful servant\u201d to the sport. \u201cIt is with great sadness that the British Boxing Board of Control has learnt of the passing of former chairman Mr Leonard \u201cNipper\u201c Read,\u201d general secretary Robert Smith said. \u201cNipper was a wonderful servant to the British Boxing Board of Control and the sport of boxing. Our condolences to Nipper\u2019s family at this time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
