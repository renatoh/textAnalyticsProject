The report by the social services inspectorate and the Audit Commission found that 75% of users and carers consider Kensington and Chelsea's social services \"good or excellent\". Key strengths included a commitment to multi-agency working, which has prevented exclusions from secondary schools, and a comprehensive human resources strategy that supports and develops staff at all levels. The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea's population is polarised between those wealthy enough to afford some of the most expensive property in the country and those dependent on benefits. It has one of highest social services budgets per capita in England and spends considerably more on social services than comparative authorities. The joint review pointed to the authority's direction of change strategy as the main reason behind its success. The programme, which is led by senior managers, aims to shift the organisational culture towards clear and consistent principles and processes driven by service users' needs. Managers were praised for encouraging staff to develop evidence-based practice. The review team also praised the authority's early assessment and intervention to help families in crisis, which had resulted in low numbers of children in care or on the child protection register. Its community care services responded more effectively to service users' needs by banding them together according to their level and complexity of needs. Director of the joint review John Bolton said: \"Kensington and Chelsea can congratulate themselves on the successful delivery of good quality social services which meet the requirements of local people. The effectiveness of social services is driven by the authority's preoccupation with developing the needs driven service across all areas.\" However, the review team pointed to some areas where improvement was needed. They called on the authority to embed business planning into everyday practice, analyse the unmet needs of users to strengthen its commissioning arrangements, and iron out variations in practice through audits to identify their impact on users. They recommended more initiatives to empower users and carers and disseminate good practice. But the report acknowledged that Kensington and Chelsea was \"already at the vanguard of good practices in many areas\". \"By adopting the recommendations of the review, the authority will protect its already solid base and ensure that it is among those social services departments with a national reputation for excellence,\" said Mr Bolton. Kensington and Chelsea council leader Merrick Cockell said: \"This has been a root and branch examination of the way we do things and we have come out of it with flying colours. It is a source of immense pride to the council that the social services we provide to our most vulnerable residents are so good. \"However, we will not rest here. There is much more we can do to raise the level of our services even higher.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
