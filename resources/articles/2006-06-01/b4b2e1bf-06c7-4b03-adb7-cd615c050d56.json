The 31-year-old, who once worked for Les Arcs' former trainer, John Gosden, sent the former all-weather handicapper and failed hurdler out to finish a creditable eleventh in the King's Stand Stakes here on Tuesday, but this success was, as he put it, 'the stuff of dreams' as he paid tribute to apprentice James O'Reilly, who rode Les Arcs to earlier wins, and Richard Guest, who trained the gelding briefly before Pitt was appointed. Pitt's stable, Merton Grange, is owned by the Glaswegian bookmaker-turned football agent Willie McKay, who has Joey Barton, Henri Camara, Laurent Robert, Jean-Alain Boumsong and Pascal Chimbomda on his books. McKay is a larger-than-life character who has had horses with many different trainers, including David Elsworth, Bryan Smart, Ralph Beckett and Kevin McAuliffe. But from 45 applicants, it was Pitt, the only one without a trainer's licence, who was chosen to succeed Vicky Haigh at Bawtry in August last year. Les Arcs was the rookie handler's first winner in December and the gelding, well ridden by John Egan here, has supplied six of the stable's nine winners since Pitt took over. Egan was involved in the selection process when Pitt went for his interview. McKay, who until recently was based in Monaco, used to own betting shops in Glasgow. A few footballing clients used to bet with him and so he changed the focus of his business to handling their interests. There is huge money to be made as an agent in football - McKay reportedly received \u00a3500,000 when Boumsong moved from Rangers to Newcastle United - and he has pumped plenty into racing, now saying that he has more horses on his books than players, quipping: 'The horses are much easier to deal with.' Pitt saddled Admiral to win the Chester Cup under a masterly ride from Egan in April, landing a gamble at big odds for McKay, and the agent again stepped in at 40-1 with 'a couple of grand each-way - 'a small bet'. The extra furlong and draw nearer the stands' rail were two of the reasons that Les Arcs was able to reverse Tuesday's placings with five of his rivals, including the winner there, the flying Australian contender Takeover Target, who ran another blinder to be third. It was the three-year-old, Balthazaar's Gift, who flew home to finish a neck behind in second. The King's Stand form was boosted again when Baltic King stormed home in the Wokingham from the favourite Firenze, who went a circuitous route around the outside of the field despite being drawn against the stands' rail in stall one. Baltic King under Jimmy Fortune took the direct line from stall six and it paid off. After greeting his winner of the Chesham Stakes, Champlain, trainer Michael Jarvis gave the news that Derby fourth, Hala Bek, worked badly in the morning and will miss the Irish Derby. The new favourite for Sunday's race at The Curragh is Darsi, winner of the French version. Kieren Fallon's hopes of snatching the award for top rider at the meeting away from Jamie Spencer was foiled when his Cover Up was pipped in the concluding Queen Alexandra Stakes by Baddam. The latter was completing a notable double, having won the Ascot Stakes on Tuesday. Looking out fromthe stands across the panoply of Royal Ascot was a great sight for those in the upper reaches of the new grandstand, whose creation took a fair chunk of the \u00a3210million used for the redevelopment of the racecourse. But for many spectators, there were problems in gaining a vantage point to watch the racing. For those in general admission areas, there was neither enough height nor enough steppings. Reports from those in the Royal Enclosure viewing areas on the fourth floor suggest that in order to guarantee a place, spectators had to be ready to find a position not long after the runners had crossed the line for the previous race. While the new Ascot, when packed to the rafters as it was on the final three days of this five-day festival, is not a place for the seasoned racegoer, where it has scored heavily is in the creation of a new paddock behind the grandstand with room for 8,000 to watch the preliminaries. This facility was never tested to its capacity and probably it never will be, whereas those fighting for the 5,500 places on the steps of the new grandstand's lowest level were certainly fully in use. Some alterations can be made. Ascot can be proud of much of the show they put on but there are plenty of problems that will be difficult to put right. Ride of the week Lester Piggott, a co-owner of the Ribblesdale winner Mont Etoile, would have been proud of the ride Michael Hills gave the filly on Thursday. Hills, drawn widest of all, immediately dropped to the rear to gain a position near the rail. Nearly last turning for home, he bravely followed Kieren Fallon, riding favourite Scottish Stage, through the narrowest of gaps inside the final furlong and, to Fallon's evident surprise, poked Mont Etoile's nose in front of the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
