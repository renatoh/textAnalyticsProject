At this rate, regardless of the pre-tour odds, it is simply a matter of time before Brian O'Driscoll slices through the Springboks for the Lions and Paul O'Connell accepts the plaudits for his side's 3\u20130 series win. Sticking a tenner on Rory McIlroy and Padraig Harrington to scoop a major golf title apiece this summer might also prove a shrewd investment. There was even a sense of destiny in the Leinster dressing-room before they emerged to stifle Leicester's double dream. \"There's nothing we can do about it. We're going to win the match, it's written,\" the young fly-half Johnny Sexton told his slightly sceptical colleagues beforehand. When the assured 23-year-old landed a huge drop-goal and curled over two beautiful penalties including the winning kick after 70 minutes, his team-mates could only marvel at the power of positive thinking. \"It was almost out of his hands,\" said O'Driscoll with a shrug. \"He knew it was going to go over.\" If the Lions could bottle that sort of belief and unpack it this morning in their Johannesburg hotel, anything is possible over the next six weeks. Leinster are not the greatest side ever to win the Heineken Cup but in many ways they are not a bad blueprint for Ian McGeechan's team to follow. Committed defence, collective resilience, a well-balanced back row and shrewd heads at centre and full-back will make you competitive, regardless of the opposition. The only concern surrounds O'Driscoll's physical state; in leading Ireland to a Six Nations grand slam and his province to a first European title, his body has taken a pounding which would make even Jonny Wilkinson wince. While the almighty BOD said on Saturday night that a sore right shoulder would not prevent him from participating fully with the Lions, there is no question every Springbok provincial team will be going out of their way to dilute his optimism. It is the same shoulder which curtailed his 2005 Lions tour in New Zealand and his self-diagnosis \u2013 \"I've been carrying it for a while...it'll take a bit of mind endurance over the summer\" \u2013 is scarcely the most comforting. That said, even a half-fit O'Driscoll is a formidable adversary and he sees no reason why the Lions cannot benefit from the shamrock feelgood factor. \"I can't see any reason why not,\" he said. \"It's going to be an incredibly difficult test but confidence is a massive component in a rugby player's mind.\" Talking of massive, the Lions can only hope they unearth a forward capable of making half the impact Rocky Elsom has done for Leinster. The Wallaby is not the only reason for his province's rise after years of underachievement but O'Driscoll's description of him as \"the best player I've ever played with\" shows just how much the mountainous flanker has contributed to a cause he clearly enjoys. \"This tournament is bigger than any domestic tournament in the southern hemisphere,\" said Elsom, still under serious pressure from the Australian Rugby Union to return to Wallaby ranks. The die-hard fan in the main stand dressed in boxing gloves, Stallone-type wig and white robe with \"Balboa\" on the back is not alone in praying the big man is available for a sequel. Those who have followed Leinster's long struggle to match the European exploits of their Munster cousins, however, were at pains to credit several other individuals. The coach Michael Cheika, another Australian, has painstakingly fostered a culture of excellence and his contribution was among those singled out by his captain Leo Cullen. \"When I went to play in England four years ago Leinster was in a bit of disarray,\" recalled the one-time Leicester lock. \"The organisation now is on a different level to what it was.\" There were also glowing name-checks for the likes of Reggie Corrigan, Victor Costello, Denis Hickie, Felipe Contepomi and Chris Whitaker but the steely constant has always been O'Driscoll. \"Brian is our talisman and has been for many years,\" said Cullen. \"I presume the Lions will look to him as well. He has such a presence about him.\" There would have been every chance, reckoned Cheika, of a touchline scene had he asked the Irish captain to come off the field injured. \"Even if I'd tried, I'd probably have got the Ronaldo treatment,\" joked the coach. Leicester, for their part, took their considerable disappointment on the chin. Either side of half-time they seemed potential winners, the sin-binning of the prop Stan Wright coinciding with a 10-point blitz which included a try by the flanker Ben Woods. The departure of the previously excellent Geordan Murphy with a hip problem robbed Leicester of some composure, however, and the Tigers' lineout work fell beneath its usual high standards. Neither did their potentially strong bench have a major last-quarter impact; ironically, it was the men with \"Caterpillar\" printed on their shirts who ran out of legs. \"It means everything. This is the one I always wanted,\" gasped O'Driscoll. All that remains is to export this heady Irish brew to southern Africa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
