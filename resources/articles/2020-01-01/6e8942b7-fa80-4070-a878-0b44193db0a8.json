Grace Wales Bonner, a much-hyped designer who has dressed Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it more than 40 years ago. Lindley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto\u2019s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for lovers rock parties. The soundtrack \u2013 put together by Jamie xx \u2013 was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken. The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a polo neck \u2013 a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women\u2019s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by the British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling. The red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner\u2019s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest \u2013 be it lovers rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie \u2013 into clothes that people want to wear. After the show, Wales Bonner \u2013 a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show \u2013 explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, \u201cinevitable\u201d because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father\u2019s experiences in London in the 70s. \u201cI was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking at John Goto\u2019s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.\u201d The 29-year-old designer saw a difference between that era and her own. \u201cI feel like there was an optimism and irreverence [then] which meant that you could sample and mix cultural references in a nonchalant way,\u201d she said. Wales Bonner\u2019s sterling work could perhaps encourage a new generation to do the same. Last year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFC/Vogue Fashion Fund prize \u2013 an investment of \u00a3200,000 \u2013 in May. The designer\u2019s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner\u2019s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand\u2019s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York. Wales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet Linton Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan Is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you\u2019ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It\u2019s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer\u2019s label. \u201cIt is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,\u201d she said to Vogue in May. \u201cIn the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2020 to correct a misspelling of Linton Kwesi Johnson\u2019s name and that of the venue, Lindley Hall in Westminster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
