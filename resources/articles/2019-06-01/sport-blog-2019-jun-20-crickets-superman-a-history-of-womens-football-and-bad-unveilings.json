Here\u2019s a documentary celebrating 50 years of the Donny Belles, trailblazers in the English game; a short film on women\u2019s football during the first world war; a game between Handley Page Girls and Ladies Sterling Football Club in 1919; women footballers looking cool as you like in 1920; a bit from BBC Teach on the history of the women\u2019s game; and the National Football Museum taking us through England\u2019s run at the unofficial World Cup in 1971. 2) The cricket World Cup is also getting there and England appear to have a chance. As such, here are some reminders of what happens when that happens: West Indies dealing with things in 1979; Australia dealing with things in 1987; and Wasim Akram dealing with things in 1992. Go carefully, people. 3) A World Cup \u201992 bonus: Jonty Rhodes channels Superman to run out Inzamam-ul-Haq. 4) It\u2019s 27 years this week since Sweden knocked England out of Euro \u201892. So here\u2019s the goal that did it, elevated by the brilliance of Barry Davies, and while we\u2019re here, some more incredible commentary: the Radio Goal collection of amazing moments, originally a cassette given away free with Goal magazine; the late, great Sid Waddell and Dave Lanning narrate Phil Taylor\u2019s two nine-darters in the Premier League final of 2010; and Richie Benaud\u2019s final stint, on the final day of the 2005 Ashes series. 5) Nerves appeared to get to Ferland Mendy as he failed to impress with some attempted keepy-ups at his Real Madrid unveiling. He isn\u2019t the first to make a mess of his tricks and flicks when being presented by one of La Liga\u2019s super-clubs. 6) Cliff Thorburn and Alex Higgins did not like one another. Sadly, YouTube is silent on the violence, but here they are, arguing over a green ball, after which an affronted Thorburn refuses Higgins the use of his extension. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) The top 10 goals of the 21st century (in someone\u2019s opinion). 2) A rally car speeds down a country road, only to find another car coming the other way. Contains swearing in Slovenian. 3) Are corners pointless? 4) The top 10 goal from the Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2011, 2015 and 2016.
