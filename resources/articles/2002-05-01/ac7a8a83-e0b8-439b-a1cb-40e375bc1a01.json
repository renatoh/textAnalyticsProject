The Manchester-based consultants GVA Grimley will explain that the obstacles and costs involved in redeveloping the current stadium - even to house a maximum of 52,000 fans, an expansion of only 7,000 - render that path unviable. Instead the club will follow Everton's lead by moving away from their spiritual home after rejecting the chance to move to Speke in south Liverpool in favour of remaining in the Anfield area. The new arena will be only a stone's throw from the current ground. Liverpool City Council has given provisional backing to the scheme, which now awaits planning permission and is likely to prompt fierce opposition from residents' groups. Liverpool's signing of the Lille midfielder Bruno Cheyrou is expected to be the first arrival in a potential \u00a330m summer spending spree. G\u00e9rard Houllier still has hopes that Auxerre's young striker Djibril Ciss\u00e9 will become available, even though the fee would top the \u00a312m agreed with Paris St-Germain for Nicolas Anelka. Ciss\u00e9, in France's World Cup squad, has insisted he wants to stay with Auxerre for another season but Houllier has said: \"Ciss\u00e9 belongs to a group of four or five players we are looking at. We've got a scope of about four or five. We also like Brett Emerton.\" Emerton, the \u00a38m-rated Feyenoord right-sided midfielder, is interesting Leeds while Liverpool are also trailing Sedan's \u00a34m defensive midfielder Alassane Salif Diao, who will be a key part of Senegal's World Cup squad. Fulham's first summer signing will be the \u00a32m Argentinian striker Facundo Sava, who is expected to join next week. Sava will move from his Argentinian club, Gimnasia, subject to a successful medical in London, which will take place in the next seven days. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
