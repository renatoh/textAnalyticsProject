The latest official assessment of the impact of the powerful stimulant in Britain says that it is a \"slowly fermenting problem\" and that there are no signs of the crystal meth epidemic predicted by some newspapers. An official intelligence assessment for the Association of Chief Police Officers says virtually every force around the country has reported instances of crystal methamphetamine use. According to the report it is making inroads into the gay clubbing scene, among a small number of women who are using it as an appetite suppressant, and within some east European communities. But so far crystal-meth related arrests, seizures and requests for treatment have remained minimal. Detective Sergeant Andy Waite, who co-ordinates national intelligence on the drug, has told Druglink, the Drugscope charity magazine, that it has yet to take off in Britain: \"We are not seeing a great deal in terms of manufacture. There are certainly no signs of an epidemic. It is a slowly fermenting problem.\" Martin Barnes, chief executive of Drugscope, said: \"The good news about crystal meth use is that it is still relatively rare in the UK. The bad news is that one reason is because we have a significant and profitable market for cocaine and crack cocaine. It is right that the police are vigilant so that hopefully any tipping point where crystal meth use takes off can be avoided.\" Crystal meth, or ice, gives users a huge rush followed by feelings of euphoria, but regular use causes sleeplessness, paranoia, and mental health problems such as psychosis. The spectacular highs eventually hamper the brain's production of dopamine - the feel good chemical - so users become increasingly dependent on the drug to feel normal. It is now a big problem in the US, parts of Europe, Australia and east Asia. DS Waite said the cheapness and popularity of cocaine was a key reason why it had not taken off. If the price of cocaine went up it would make it easier to grab some of the recreational drug market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
