Various facial injuries to Neil Lennon as a result of high jinks at the players' night out were followed by news from their chairman Brian Quinn that the club is heavily in debt and thereafter immediate doubts cast by the manager Martin O'Neill that he could take the club forward without some heavy spending. Then, on Saturday, Celtic suffered a rare 2-0 defeat at the hands of Aberdeen. Most of this, of course, seems much worse that it actually is simply because everything in the garden up to now has been so rosy for O'Neill and company. Indeed, the result will more than likely prove to be a mere hiccup and it has certainly done no serious damage to Celtic's championship hopes for they still lead Rangers by 10 points with a game in hand. At Pittodrie there was also a marked lack of goodwill to all men as Aberdeen completed nine home victories in a row to equal a record that dates back to Alex Ferguson's tenure, and even the prospect of a Scottish Football Association probe into why supporters were allowed to pelt Celtic players with snowballs will not dilute their joy. John Hartson, Stilian Petrov and Alan Thompson suffered and the Welshman's woe was complete when he handled a Robbie Winters corner after 58 minutes to give away a penalty that Winters converted. It was the breakthrough the Dons needed to exorcise the ghost of meetings past with Celtic, for in recent times they have conceded 35 goals and scored just two in nine games. Victory was completed in the dying seconds when the goalkeeper Rab Douglas lost control of a Joos Valgaeren back-pass and Darren Mackie was presented with a simple second. The Aberdeen star had some sympathy for Douglas and declared: \"You don't become a bad goalkeeper overnight and Rab will bounce back from this.\" So will Celtic. O'Neill was gracious after his team's first domestic defeat of the season and admitted: \"We haven't lost a significant game in the Premier League for a year so it had to happen sometime.\" It was joy unconfined for Aberdeen, naturally, and their manager Ebbe Skovdahl declared: \"We can all have a good Christmas now. I told the players they had to stand up to Celtic physically and although they have a few bruises they don't mind that.\" There were nine bookings in a fiercely contested match and the Aberdeen captain Derek Whyte was sent off after two yellow cards. By comparison, there was plenty of festive good cheer at Ibrox where Rangers secured an excellent 3-2 win against Dundee United with only the visitors' Steven Thompson booked. That rather blotted the striker's copybook because his two goals made it more fraught than it needed to be for the home team, although they finally edged through thanks to a double from the impressive Shota Arveladze and a header from Lorenzo Amoruso. Third-placed Livingston were held to a no-score draw by Dunfermline at Almondvale and there were no goals either at McDiarmid Park between St Johnstone and Hibernian. Kilmarnock, however, grabbed a 2-1 away win at Dundee thanks to goals from Ally Mitchell and a winner from Stevie Murray and there was a sound 3-1 home victory for Hearts courtesy of a double from Ricardo Fuller and one from Kevin McKenna after Motherwell, who had Eddie Forrest sent off, took the lead through Stuart Elliott."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
