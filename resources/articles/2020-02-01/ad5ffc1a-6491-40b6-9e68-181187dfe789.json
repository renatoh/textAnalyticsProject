The government said it was firmly committed to announcing locations this year so that the first could open in 2021. The idea was first raised by Boris Johnson during his campaign to become Conservative leader. It is proposing zones \u2013 which do not necessarily have to be located in a port \u2013 where no duty is paid on goods until they enter the full UK market, meaning none at all is paid if they are re-exported from the port. Other extra freedoms include duties only being paid on final goods, not on any raw materials that are imported into the area and then processed. Businesses would be exempt from filling out full customs declarations on imported goods. The government has argued that these zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment, notably to deprived coastal areas. There could be measures to \u201creduce the costs of hiring workers working in Freeport sites\u201d, the government said, not specifying how this could be done. The ports could also trial ideas in areas such as customs and transport before they are rolled out across the country. After the 10-week consultation, areas will be invited to bid to become one of the zones. Among half a dozen ministerial quotes sent out to talk up the idea, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: \u201cFreeports represent a fantastic opportunity for our businesses to increase their trade with companies from all over the world. Not only will they help create jobs and level up the UK but they underscore our commitment to championing global free trade, unleashing our country\u2019s potential.\u201d There is, however, some caution about the risk of freeports being used as a base for money laundering or other organised crime. In a report on illicit financing last year, the European commission said freeports could be \u201cpotentially vulnerable to money laundering or terrorism financing\u201d in the European single market. The European justice commissioner, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said freeports were \u201cthe new emerging threat\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is something we want to focus more on.\u201d Labour has condemned the idea. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called freeports a \u201crevival of a failed Thatcherite plan from the 1980s designed to cut away at regulation and our tax base\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is very little solid evidence that so-called freeports create jobs or boost economic growth, showing this up as another ideological move from a far-right government. This plan only represents a levelling-up for the super-rich, who will use freeports to hoard assets and avoid taxes while the rest of us feel the effects of under-funded public services.\u201d Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 business and trade spokeswoman, said: \u201cNo number of freeports can replace the economic benefits of seamless and tariff-free trade with Europe. Freeports don\u2019t create new jobs or business opportunities, while their special administrative status makes them a tax-avoidance and money-laundering risk. The country needs real investment, not white elephants like freeports.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
