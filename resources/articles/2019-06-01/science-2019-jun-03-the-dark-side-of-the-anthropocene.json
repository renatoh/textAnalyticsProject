What it does not do, however, is give any indication of what the potential catastrophic consequences of the Anthropocene might be for the survival of the human species on the planet (though the links Nicola Davison provides do deal with this to some extent). It is quite possible that the assumption is that everyone who reads the Guardian and similar quality newspapers and magazines already knows about these \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d predictions, but a research project I am coordinating, on how media all over the world in all the major languages report the Anthropocene, strongly suggests that the dominant Anthropocene narratives tend to neutralise the risks or to reassure us that science and technology will find ways to avert the worst, the so-called \u201cgood\u201d Anthropocene. Even the Guardian, whose extensive coverage of the Anthropocene is cited and reproduced all over the world, generally relays these reassuring messages.
