The carefully planned heist began shortly after 8.30am on Tuesday, when two of the robbers walked into the main entrance of a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole branch on Piazza Ascoli and and pointed guns at the staff, Italian media reported. Two accomplices then emerged from a manhole inside the bank that connects to an underground tunnel. The gang scuffled with the bank manager, who yelled \u201cIt\u2019s a robbery\u201d, and held him and another staff member hostage as dozens of police officers surrounded the bank. A third employee managed to escape. Police sealed off the area before entering the bank, but the robbers activated a fire extinguisher, creating confusion and giving them time to escape back down the manhole. Several officers reportedly followed them into the sewers but lost them. The robbers took 20 safe-deposit boxes, but it is not yet clear what they contained. The bank manager was reportedly hit on the head with the butt of a gun, but no other staff were harmed. Speaking to reporters outside the bank after the ordeal, the manager said: \u201cThey entered from the basement. There were three of us inside when I realised what was happening and shouted. There was a short scuffle but they did not beat me.\u201d Milan prosecutors have opened an investigation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
