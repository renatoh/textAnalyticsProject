But the decision by the chancellor to increase air passenger duty was undermined in the eyes of the green movement when he scrapped a proposed flight tax, saying it would have damaged airlines, which were going through a tough financial period. Air passenger duty is currently levied at \u00a310 on a passenger flying economy class to European destinations and \u00a340 for those going further, but the Alistair Darling has introduced new bands. The starting level will be \u00a311 on tickets to places within 2,000 miles of London, \u00a345 for flights of up to 6,000 miles and \u00a355 over that. The changes do not come into effect until November next year but by the 2010/2011 tax year, the duty on a flight to a destination such as Bankok, Johannesburg or Victoria will rise to \u00a360. Darling justified the move as one to reduce carbon emissions. \"I have decided to reform APD into a four-band system ensuring that those who travel further and have a larger environmental impact meet that cost,\" he said. But his decision to drop an airline duty that had been proposed earlier angered campaigners. The World Development Movement said it was \"bad news for the UK tax payer, the environment and the world's poor\". The airline industry was delighted, saying it had \"won the battle\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
