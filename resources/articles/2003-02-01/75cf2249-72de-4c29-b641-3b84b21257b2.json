Bergkamp can expect a fine and/or a one-match ban if found guilty. It follows an incident against West Ham at Highbury last month when he caught Lee Bowyer in the face with an arm in the build-up to Arsenal's second goal. The incident was missed by the officials but the FA decided there was a case to answer after viewing video evidence. Bergkamp has described the clash as an \"accident\", saying he was protecting the ball. The Dutch forward was fined \u00a35,000 by the FA this season for improper conduct after stamping on Blackburn's Nils-Eric Johansson. He was warned then as to his future conduct and that could stiffen the penalty if he is found guilty this time. He has 14 days to respond to the charge. Cole had minor surgery after his hernia problem worsened in the wake of Arsenal's 0-0 draw at Ajax. He is now in danger of missing England's back-to-back Euro 2004 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Turkey, which start in just over four weeks' time. The left-back will sit out Arsenal's FA Cup tie against Chelsea as well a Champions League game at home to Roma and Premiership action. The earliest he could return seems to be at Valencia on March 19. If he is not back by the Everton match on March 23 he is unlikely to figure in the England games. On a more positive note for Arsenal, Freddie Ljungberg could feature against Charlton on Sunday after playing 74 minutes of a reserve game against the same opponents. He last started for the first team in December and has been struggling with an achilles problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
