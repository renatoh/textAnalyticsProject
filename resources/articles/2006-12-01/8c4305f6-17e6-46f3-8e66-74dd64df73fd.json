It wasn't an ad, though, it was merely the latest chapter in hip-hop's sneaker wars. Ever since a young Russell Simmons engineered an endorsement deal worth $1.5m for Run DMC and their Adidas in 1986, hip-hop and sneakers have been firm friends. Fast forward to 2006 and you're no one in hip-hop if you don't have your own line. Nike have worked with everyone from Wu-Tang Clan to Roc-A-Fella records, while Pharrell, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Nelly and Mike Skinner have all signed for Reebok. The Pack, meanwhile, have flipped the script. They not only penned Vans without any endorsement from the sneaker company, but they've also gone outside the realms of hip-hop's sneaker world. Traditionally kept to the big four (Reebok, Puma, Adidas and Nike - with extra props for classics like Adidas Shelltoes and Nike Air Force Ones), Vans stray into indie-punk territory. Worn by the likes of Green Day and Blink 182, and sponsors of the skate-punk Warped Tour, they are firmly the footwear of white boys with guitars, an alternative to The Strokes' Converse. Detroit ska band The Suicide Machines actually pipped The Pack to the post with their 1996 homage The Vans Song (\"Get a pair of Vans or God will send you to hell\"). In short, the checkered slip-ons aren't used to being worn with The Pack's baggy pants, baseball caps and grills. But then Vans speaks for a new skate cool bubbling under in hip-hop. Cue Pharrell's hook-up with Japanese streetwear label A Bathing Ape and Lupe Fiasco spotted on a skateboard. It's at street level, too. A Bathing Ape's New York store is regularly mobbed by hip-hop kids after the shiny Bapesta sneakers checked by the likes of Clipse, and Vans sales are up in urban stores. Labelled \"Oreos\" at school for their white boy footwear, The Pack are part of this new generation. The group's Young Stunna told Blender magazine they bonded over skate culture: \"We skated, we all thought [skate legend] Steve Caballero was cool.\" Showing such shameless love for the \"punk rock shoe\" and the skate/hip-hop it symbolises, Vans has become a hot topic in forums and outraged hip-hop purists. Rapper Drino Man has even written answer track Fuck Vans. All about the old school, he argues Tupac and Snoop wouldn't be caught dead in \"skate boy\" Vans, while Nike and Adidas are \"real sneakers.\" The footwear wars rage on. Let's just hope Hi-Tec don't get involved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
