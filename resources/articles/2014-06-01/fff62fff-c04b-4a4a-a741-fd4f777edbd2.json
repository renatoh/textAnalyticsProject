Although enterprises like Airbnb, the San Francisco-based spare-room letting business, have been around since 2007, the newcomer that is really shaking up the traditional business model in the UK is Uber taxis It has already so alarmed black-cab drivers in London they are threatening a gridlock protest next week. Now it has opened in Manchester. The way Uber exploits the commonplace technologies of GPS and a smartphone app challenges almost everything about the old way of hiring a cab. But what has the potential to be truly transformative is less the technology than the culture that it both facilitates and on which it relies. Passengers and drivers are encouraged to rate one another, a system of peer review that puts mutual trust at the heart of the system in a way that reduces the importance of a rule-based culture while \u2013 by fostering relationships between individuals \u2013 enhancing social capital The disruptive impact of the internet is nothing new. But the idea of using it to build an economy around the shared use of surplus, privately-owned assets where personal reputation is an integral aspect of a business could, its more optimistic fans believe, amount to a kind of digital socialism. It means a more efficient use of scarce resources, and by making renting a cheap and easy human interaction, it lowers the premium on ownership. Others warn, though, that it is really just another move in the onward march of neoliberalism that will only swell the extreme precariat. They say reputation is no alternative to the regulations that serve an irreplaceable purpose as protector of consumer safety. Vested interests make the same case. In Brussels, taxis using the app face a 10,000 euro fine. In France, after Paris was brought to a halt by a taxi blockade, President Hollande attempted to protect taxi drivers by insisting that cars using the app wait 15 minutes before picking up a fare, only to be overruled by the constitutional court. Californian insurance regulators mutter about gaps in cover. New York has insisted Airbnb provides data so hotel taxes can be levied (central London boroughs ban all lets of less than 90 days). Here, judges will rule whether Uber breaks the law on using a meter. The scope for using technology to link demand and supply in space as well as time, and to supplement formal rules with reputation has already launched a thousand low-cost startups. But more mature peer-to-peer businesses are finding that the back office cannot be entirely replaced. It could be that the sharing economy is more evolution than the revolution idealists hoped for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
