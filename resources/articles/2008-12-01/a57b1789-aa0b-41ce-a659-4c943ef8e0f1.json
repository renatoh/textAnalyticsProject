California congresswoman Hilda Solis, is to lead the department of labour. Solis was instrumental in raising California's minimum wage while in the state legislature and is known for her work on environmental issues. The daughter of immigrants, Solis thanked Obama and her family in Spanish. She replaces Elaine Chao. Solis is known for her close union ties and won praise from immigration activists for championing immigration reform. Obama nominated an Illinois Republican, former congressman Ray LaHood, to be secretary of transportation. LaHood, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, will help direct billions of dollars in federal road and infrastructure spending. The department also regulates interstate shipping. Lahood is the second Republican in Obama's cabinet. President Bush's defence secretary Robert Gates will stay on into the next year. LaHood succeeds Mary Peters. Ron Kirk, the African-American former mayor of Dallas, Texas, was named US trade representative. He replaces Susan Schwab. Also, Obama named Karen Mills to lead the small business administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
