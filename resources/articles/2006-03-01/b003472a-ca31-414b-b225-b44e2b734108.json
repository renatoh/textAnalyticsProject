Up to 600,000 workers will be covered by the scheme, which was drawn up after 21 Chinese cocklers drowned at Morecambe Bay in 2004. The government controversially proposed to limit the scheme to far fewer workers by excluding labour supplied to the packaging and processing industries, despite evidence of extensive abuse in these areas. Ministers had feared including the sectors would increase the regulatory burden on small businesses, but after pressure from trade unions, supermarkets and the temporary labour industry itself the government changed its mind. The new system will come fully to force in April next year, after which anyone who supplies labourers to the agriculture or food processing and packing industries will have to have a licence. For gangmasters supplying labour to the shellfish industry, licensing will start from October this year. Gangmasters who operate without a licence will be fined up to \u00a35,000 or face 10 years in prison. Licences will be administered by the Gangmaster Licensing Authority. Announcing the scheme the agriculture minister, Jim Kinight, said: \"We are acting to protect everyone involved in picking, processing, preparing or packing produce if they are supplied by gangmasters.\" But he added that the new system would be reviewed after a year to ensure it did not become excessively burdensome for business. Jack Dromey, deputy general secretary of the T&amp;G union, said: \"This serves notice on the rogues and scoundrels who plague this industry. \"Those who rip off and exploit their workers and clients, wherever they may be in the food chain, will not be tolerated or rewarded with a contract to supply labour. \"The T&amp;G campaigned vigorously for full licensing. Rogue gangmasters are experts in dodging labour law. Their scams are not limited to shaving a few pounds off wage packets but include tax fraud, intimidation and criminality.\" He added: \"We commend the government for listening to the views of the industry, who said clearly and consistently that only licensing from farm to factory will work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
