Hours before a deadline of midnight to fund the government, the White House said the prospect of a shutdown had \u201cratcheted up\u201d and blamed Democrats for objecting to the short-term spending measure that narrowly passed the House of Representatives on Thursday. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Friday evening he expected an agreement to be reached within the next 24 hours. \u201cI think there is a deal in the next 24 hours because of the nature of the back and forth between the House and the Senate I look at more in terms of what gets done before the offices are supposed to open on Monday,\u201d Mulvaney told CNN. By Friday afternoon, it was clear Democrats and a handful of Republicans were steadfast in their opposition. Donald Trump canceled plans to travel to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and summoned the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to the White House. Despite huddling behind closed doors for an hour and 15 minutes, the two New Yorkers fell short of reaching a deal. \u201cWe made some progress but we still have a good number of disagreements,\u201d Schumer told reporters upon returning to Capitol Hill. \u201cThe discussion will continue.\u201d On Twitter, Trump offered a rosier assessment, declaring: \u201cExcellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!\u201d John Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said he had spoken to White House chief of staff John Kelly and heard that \u201cthe president told [Schumer] to go back to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and work it out\u201d. \u201cThe ball is in Senator Schumer\u2019s court,\u201d he said. The meeting came hours after the White House laid blame squarely on the Democratic leader for bringing the federal government to the brink, even coining the term \u201cSchumer shutdown\u201d. \u201cWe do not want a shutdown,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters. \u201cIf Mr Schumer insists on it, he is in a position to force this on the American people.\u201d But a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Friday found that 48% of Americans would blame Trump and the Republicans in the event of a government shutdown; 28% said the Democrats would be responsible and 18% said both parties would be equally at fault. In a floor speech in the Senate, Mitch McConnell said a vote on the stopgap spending measure should be a \u201cno brainer\u201d. Democrats were willing to \u201chold the entire nation hostage\u201d to protect \u201cpeople who came into the United States illegally\u201d, he said. \u201cTo even repeat this position out loud is to see how completely ridiculous it is.\u201d Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, was more blunt. \u201cThis is the greatest country in the world, but we do have some really stupid people representing it from time to time,\u201d he said. Trump was preparing to mark his first year in office on Saturday, potentially as the first president to oversee a shutdown with a single party in control of the government. In an early morning tweet, he wrote: \u201cShutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!\u201d House Republican leaders, who found enough conservative votes to pass an extension of government funding through 16 February, said they would send their members home, escalating pressure on the Senate to pass something similar. In a subsequent advisory, House Republicans were told to \u201cremain flexible\u201d. Schumer has proposed a shorter stopgap measure, which would expire after four or five days, as a way of averting a shutdown without compromising Democrats\u2019 attempts to negotiate an immigration deal. Republicans balked at that timeline, noting that the shorter-term proposal would not resolve the issues over immigration or domestic spending. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, called the proposal \u201cunproductive\u201d. Mark Meadows, leader of the powerful conservative House Freedom Caucus, rejected it outright. Senate Democrats cited a number of shortcomings in the House funding bill, ranging from immigration to emergency disaster relief. A handful of conservatives in the Senate also objected, leaving Republicans short of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster. A shutdown would place nearly 40% of federal employees on unpaid furlough and cost the US an estimated $6.5bn a week. The primary sticking point for Democrats remained a failure to offer protections for the nearly 700,000 undocumented migrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the US as children. In September, Trump rescinded an Obama-era program that granted temporary legal status, exposing the young migrants to deportation. The already-fraught negotiations were severely damaged last week when Trump reportedly questioned the need to admit immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d, in reference to Haiti, El Salvador and Africa. Trump then undermined efforts by Republicans to garner support for their bill, denouncing the measure for including a six-year reauthorization of a popular children\u2019s health insurance program. The White House strongly rejected the notion that the president had been disengaged and bore some of the blame for the breakdown in bipartisan talks. \u201cThere is no way you could lay this at the feet of the president of the United States,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cHe is actively working to get a deal.\u201d Amid the chaos on Friday morning, the Democratic congressman Al Green once again forced the House to vote on Trump\u2019s impeachment. Though the resolution was again postponed on a strong bipartisan vote, it drew more support from Democrats than previously.
