The attachment to marriage and its meaning is deeply rooted in the African-American, Latino, Asian and white communities.\" There is no doubt that election day was a big step back for equal rights for all Americans. And it's ironic that on a night when the elder civil rights movement was essentially achieved, the new civil rights movement to give equal protection under the law to gays and lesbians was broken over the knee of bigotry. Gays and lesbians now have the right to marry in only two states: Connecticut and Massachusetts. Many thought the left coast of California would add momentum to the campaign for equal rights. Nevertheless, it failed. But those who believe religious beliefs shouldn't govern over a secular nation should take comfort. Demographics and a liberal youth, as well as an African-American president uncomfortable with the black community's homophobia, will ensure that our gay brothers and sisters achieve equal protection under the law. In a survey conducted between late August and late September by Faith in Public Life, young religious Americans between the ages of 18 and 35 said things their religiously conservative parents wouldn't like to hear. Three-fifths of respondents said there should be some legal recognition of gay and lesbian couples; 46% support legal recognition without any caveats, while the number jumps to 60% when the questioner tells the respondent that churches would not have to marry gay and lesbian couples. Their older counterparts are not as tolerant: just 29% support same-sex marriage without caveats, while 44% support it when assured churches wouldn't have to perform the ritual for gay and lesbian couples. This survey shows that support for equal rights for gay and lesbians is accelerating among young Americans. In 2004, the Pew Charitable Trust asked young Americans between the ages of 15 and 25 whether they supported gay marriage; 56% said yes. Lake Snell Perry, who conducted the survey, had this observation: \"For them, these values transcend the realm of gay issues and have become part of their larger view of the way America should look.\" Apparently, young Americans believe in justice for all. Then there is the homophobia that permeates the black community. African-Americans in the US are liberal stalwarts. Yet, on November 4, they voted yes to Proposition 8 at an alarming rate of two-to-one. Explaining his vote in favour of the ballot initiation, Bilson Davis told the Los Angeles Times: \"I was born black. I can't change that. They weren't born gay; they chose it.\" Summoning Leviticus, which states that \"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination\", another black man called gay marriage an \"abomination\". Gays and lesbians were rightly disappointed in the black community's inability to see their struggle for equal protection as a photo negative of their own. But, again, like young Americans, the black community will eventually come around, especially because of Obama's electoral victory. On the campaign trail, Obama, in an act of tremendous political courage, spoke out against homophobia in the black community during a visit to a black church in Atlanta in January: \"If we are honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved community. We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them.\" If Obama continues to take this principled stand on gay rights and equates it, rightly, to the civil rights movement, a majority of African-Americans will transcend double standards. The fight for equal rights is almost over. Already, this past weekend, protests for equal rights washed over the nation like a pink tide. Join the Impact, a gay-rights group that organised the nationwide march, estimated that over a million people participated. It's inevitable: young Americans of all colours and creeds will eventually wash away the hatred of their folks, just like they did 40 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
