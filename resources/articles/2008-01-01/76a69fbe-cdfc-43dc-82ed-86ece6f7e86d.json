The Dulcimer, at 567 Wilbraham Road, Chorlton, has no lasers, nor even a dancefloor. This evening, the stage hosts an unmanned harp and an acoustic guitarist, John Stammers, who begins by apologising if his singing is slurred - \"I've just had my wisdom teeth out.\" Nevertheless, as Stammers' haunting, Nick Drakeish tones waft across the venue, the crowd is mesmerised. Among them is the venue's owner, Lee Janda, a new champion of a particular kind of Manchester music. Unlike Tony Wilson, though, Janda's passion isn't the cutting edge of alternative music. After bringing us Factory, the Hacienda and the upsurge in guitar bands that followed Oasis, the Rainy City is again buzzing - but to the quieter revolution of folk. Following years of relative obscurity, folk musicians are suddenly popping up all over the city - those on the scene estimate there are 50 or so up-and-coming acts. However, this is not folk in the stereotypical image of mandolin-playing old men with beards. Manchester's upcoming folk stars are young, in touch with modern music and internet-savvy. \"Ten years ago, acoustic gigs in Manchester were, with respect, all older men with beards or three people there,\" says Pete Philipson, who plays in Starless and Bible Black, and runs the Timbreland label, which - to his amusement - has a website visited by fans of Timbaland, the American hip-hop producer, or Timberland, the outdoor wear manufacturer. \"In the 90s, if you put on a singer-songwriter in a bar, people would walk out and go next door to hear a guy with decks,\" he says. \"Nowadays it's the other way round.\" The Dulcimer reflects the scene's beguiling mixture of traditional and modern - named after a medieval folk instrument, boasting peculiarly-named real ales, but with DJ culture in the form of record decks spinning all manner of weird folk and psychedelia. \"I've come up against old folkies who say things like 'This is not folk,'\" sighs Janda. \"But if I catered for them, the venue would be deserted. The people here have been DJing for 15 years. We just play different records.\" Three years in the planning and housed in a former art shop, the Dulcimer has been designed down to such details as using the same loudspeakers as the legendary New York nightclub Studio 54. The venue's ornate posters are Manchester folk's equivalent of the psychedelic-era ones that adorned San Francisco's Fillmore and reflect a similar feeling of history being made. Janda admits that eight months' work went into finding the right typeface for the posters, but he is an obsessive who knows just what he wants. He lived for many years in south London and sees the Dulcimer as re-enacting that area's ideal of the bar-pub as the centre of the community. \"I've always known what a party atmosphere is,\" he says. \"Which has given me the edge.\" The venue has also been helped by the patronage - two or three nights a week - of Chorlton's most famous musical resident. \"People saw Badly Drawn Boy standing outside and suddenly it was the place to go,\" says Liz Green, a young songwriter influenced by American blues and gospel. However, according to Lee Gorton - formerly singer in Alfie, \"the folk Stone Roses\" - who now promotes new folk under the banner Down at the Red Bricks, the Dulcimer's masterstroke was tapping into an emerging city-wide phenomenon. Young Mancunians are tiring of dance and indie and tuning into more esoteric joys. \"You get a few mad folk enthusiasts and a few mental record collectors and, all of a sudden, there's a scene,\" he says. Philipson remembers his own epiphany: \"You realise there's more to folk than Joni Mitchell.\" Most of these musicians came to folk through their rock heroes. Philipson discovered the music through his childhood favourite band, Led Zeppelin, when he traced what they had listened to and discovered Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. Similarly, John Stammers first heard of Nick Drake when the Cure's Robert Smith started revealing his own influences. Stammers' grandfather was a folk pianist, but his grandson was, at first, more interested in \"the delights of the Hacienda\". However, after DJing and glass-collecting, Stammers would often end up back at his flat, strumming a guitar. He insists that if you listen very closely, you can hear an \"acid house element\" in his stark, finger-picking rhythms. However, his big inspiration is the old folk favourite, a broken heart. He took three years to get over his own before he suddenly found the songs flowing as he sat on a Canadian beach. He now combines a reputation as the \"Mancunian Nick Drake\" with a three-day working week as a plasterer and tiler. Nancy Elizabeth, Timbreland's star haunting vocalist, has received appreciative emails from 1960s folk band Pentangle and played gigs with John Renbourn, but confesses that her \"biggest influence is probably Radiohead\". \"I play Kid A all the time.\" Nancy Elizabeth - who works part-time in a deli - doesn't think about where her songs come from. She just starts humming a melody and the words come later. \"Someone came up to me at a gig and said, 'Please don't kill yourself',\" she reveals. \"A lot of the songs are about death. I've no idea why.\" Historically, Manchester acts have been fronted by motormouth frontmen like Liam Gallagher and Ian Brown. However, the folkier contingent insist that the city spawns equally great talents who go unnoticed because they're unable to sell themselves. \"My favourite Manchester artist ever is George Thomas,\" says Liz Green. \"He's made six excellent albums, but is a total failure at self-promotion.\" Green - who records for local indie Humble Soul - has had \"every A&amp;R man\" contacting her but hasn't responded to any. However, if the artists can take care of the creative side, there is now a growing infrastructure in place to do the business for them. Lee Gorton's Red Bricks nights host several acts, and admission usually costs between \u00a33 and \u00a35. Gorton is setting himself up as a cheerleader for Manchester's \"mellow souls\". \"If you're in an R&amp;B band, the first thing you do is yell, 'I've got the flava,' before you even write songs,\" he says. \"This lot sit in the house all day and just about dare to do a gig. No one's shouting their mouth off. This is mellow, soulful music. But it's up to the likes of me to start going on about it.\" Gorton plans an \"army of folkies\" to take the music around the country. He's enthusiastic to the point of sounding almost unhinged, but it's hard not to be swept along by his fervour. Gorton argues that modern Manchester musicians are following in the traditions of \"bards\" who roamed the battlefields of old, documenting events in song. \"The pubs here are our battlefields,\" he says. \"But no one will knock you out if you're carrying a guitar. It gives you a mystic energy.\" Gorton is not the only folk-based promoter on the rise - the Red Deer Club, Pineapple Folk and B-Music (a collective of DJs, musicians and visual artists including Andy Votel of Badly Drawn Boy andAlfie's old label, Twisted Nerve) also put on gigs across the city, and the Hedge one-nighter occupies Whalley Range's Carlton club, a former ballroom. Interest in the scene has exploded via communications on MySpace and CD-Rs handed out at gigs and left in record shops. Philipson reckons that because of downloads, artists are becoming enthused by possibilities such as fusing the Stone Roses \"with a recording made in Seattle in 1936\", and the scene throbs with weird cross-generational juxtapositions. Manchester's folk boom is unlikely to remain tied to the Rainy City for long. The Down at the Red Bricks nights are spreading to London, Birmingham, Nottingham and (next up) Newcastle, while Janda has global ambitions. \"Dance music's come to its end,\" he says, edging closer to Tony Wilson territory. \"I want to take this to Ibiza.\" Manchester's mellow souls Nancy Elizabeth: Haunting vocals, acclaimed postrock folk and a mastery of instruments from the dulcimer to the Indian harmonium.
