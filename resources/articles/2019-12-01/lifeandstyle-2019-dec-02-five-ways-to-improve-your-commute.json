A 2017 study by Chatterjee\u2019s team, Commuting and Wellbeing, found that longer rail commutes, where you\u2019re more likely to get a seat and be more comfortable and relaxed, were unsurprisingly associated with less stress than short rail journeys. Get active On average, says Chatterjee, \u201ccommute satisfaction is much higher among walkers and cyclists\u201d. His 2017 report found that active commuters didn\u2019t feel robbed of leisure time to the extent that others do, implying they view it as a beneficial use of time, getting exercise and relaxation. But researchers at the University of Surrey warned this year that pollution spikes in the evenings, and therefore advised taking more leisurely, back street routes home. Meditate Your commute time might be better spent, says Chatterjee, \u201cdoing something relaxing such as mindfulness, to be calm before and after work\u201d. If you\u2019re not yet ready for meditating in public, arm yourself with a good audiobook or podcast. Be friendly Commuters are in a state of denial when it comes to their need for human connection. We may hide behind our phones and avoid eye contact at all costs, but chatting to a stranger would make us happier. Take the 2014 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, with the title, Mistakenly Seeking Solitude. The 200 train commuters who took part insisted that their ideal commutes would be spent in solitude. The researchers then split the self-styled loners into three groups. The first rode on their own, the second were told to connect with another commuter, while the third group just commuted in their regular way. Who ended up having the most positive commute? Those who had had a nice chat whether they\u2019d been told to or it just happened naturally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
