A week later, Zac, 17, who knows exactly how it is to be down and out in Petrie, was asked for his reaction to the prime minister\u2019s gesture \u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister? I thought it was Tony Abbott. I don\u2019t know who [Turnbull] is.\u201d Zac is not alone in his experience at the margins of the government\u2019s second most marginal seat in Australia. He comes from the crisis end of the youth unemployment spectrum. After a traumatic childhood in a family with a long history of drug use and involvement in crime, Zac lived on the streets and surfed couches from the age of 14. \u201cI was booting up [ice] all the time, mixing with bleach, whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family, they didn\u2019t want me. Just on the street, doing crime to get money, whatever. Hardly sleeping.\u201d On the cusp of adulthood, Zac\u2019s aspirations are to \u201cjust get a job, a house, get on my feet and just have kids and treat them how I didn\u2019t get treated with my mum and dad\u201d. They\u2019re the kinds of opportunities the Coalition is seeking to promote through its $751m Path (Prepare, Trial, Hire) scheme to subsidise internships for young people on Centrelink payments who have never worked. In Petrie, youth unemployment has fallen from 18% to 14% since the Coalition\u2019s Luke Howarth won the seat in 2013 by 871 votes (0.6%). But it remains a persistent concern in a seat that both major parties regard as a must-win if they are to take government. Petrie has been held by every government of the day since 1987. Turnbull on his visit to Petrie with Howarth last month lauded the role of job network providers such as Help in getting young people into jobs. But Zac is not the kind who could walk into a mainstream job network provider and just get with the program. To get youths Zac \u201cjob ready\u201d, providers like Help rely on the likes of Gerry Lister. Lister is the straight-talking, tattooed director of Youth Development Foundation and Employment Outcomes whose mentoring has earned her the tag \u201cstreet Mumsy\u201d among local youths living rough. \u201cZac\u2019s Centrelink payments were up in the air because he could not engage with any service because of all the other stuff going on in his world,\u201d Lister says. \u201cNot because he didn\u2019t want to, but you try sending a homeless young person a letter. They can\u2019t keep a mobile phone number for more than 48 hours.\u201d Zac came to Lister after hearing about her from another homeless youth. He\u2019s been clean more than three months, is now in stable accommodation at Rothwell and is about to do work experience as a painter doing a housing commission contract at North Lakes. If all goes well, he\u2019ll get a paid job out of it. Lister says this upbeat scenario takes a year of ongoing mentoring, including \u201cintensive\u201d everyday contact for the first three months in a job. \u201cIt\u2019s super scary stuff for a young person that\u2019s never done it, so they need as many people around them as they can get,\u201d she says. \u201cOne kid was panel-beating. Every day we were picking him up, dropping him at work, taking his lunch, picking him up in the afternoon and taking him back home, just to make sure he was getting the whole process. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have their trust so that they know they can call anytime and go, \u2018It\u2019s freaking me out, it\u2019s too much,\u2019 instead of just not turning up or doing the wrong thing deliberately to get the sack.\u201d This kind of advocacy is familiar territory for the Labor candidate for Petrie, Jacqui Pederson, who has worked with Lister in her role as a local government community development officer, and enjoys her enthusiastic backing over Howarth. Pederson cites unexpected effects of youth homelessness in Petrie, like a surge of youths flocking to the beachside suburb of Redcliffe once a second rail connection is in place. \u201cThere\u2019s showers, toilets, beaches, leftover fish and chips,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be homeless it\u2019s one of the better places, but it needs to be a safe place and you need to have the support services like Gerry\u2019s to transition those young people back.\u201d She says Labor\u2019s Youth Jobs Connect program for 3,000 at-risk youth would address the gap in \u201cthat really holistic wraparound support for every aspect of life that young people like Zac need\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t just give a young person a job and expect it miraculously to work out,\u201d she says. Lister\u2019s pitch for more frontline services funding is thus: \u201cIf you can invest $10,000 into Zac in a year, if that gets him off the street, into stable accommodation, working and paying taxes \u2013 not committing crimes and taking up time and money through the court system \u2013 you\u2019re saving another $50,000 because he\u2019s not the person he was. \u201cIf you can do that 100 times in a year with 100 people \u2013 thanks for coming. I\u2019ll be PM before you know it.\u201d Pederson sums up the main concerns in Petrie as \u201cjobs, penalty rates, health, education and renewable energy\u201d. The electorate straddles long-term pockets of outer suburban disadvantage and growing master-planned communities that are a magnet for young families and retail behemoths such as Costco and Ikea. A job at McDonald\u2019s, Hungry Jacks or a Westfield shopping centre represents the better end of what\u2019s on offer for working youth. The concentration of solar panels on roofs would rival most other communities in Australia. Pederson says Labor\u2019s pledge to fully fund the Gonski education reforms, its attack on the Coalition over its previously flagged moves to raise patient costs under Medicare, and its commitment to restore renewable energy targets all go down well. \u201cOften the government is saying we can\u2019t afford Medicare, we can\u2019t afford education, and people are saying, of course we can, that\u2019s what we paid taxes for, that\u2019s what we work for, that\u2019s the one thing we expect the government to provide,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd obviously people are talking about those companies that aren\u2019t paying their fair share and they\u2019re not contributing and people see that as unfair so we need to balance that out better.\u201d Pederson says most Petrie voters are not scared by a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d and appreciate a link between pricing carbon, driving renewables and limiting climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cPeople are more concerned about having access to affordable renewable energy and I guess the control of the mining companies and the electricity companies and the cost of electricity,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd people are really concerned about what is happening to the environment \u2013 the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching \u2013 and they want to see change.\u201d Whether that appetite for change extends to their local MP remains moot, with a close contest for Petrie still looming a week out from poll day. There are no signs of a blowout against Howarth, with polling to date showing a result \u201cnot far from\u201d where it was in 2013, according to Labor\u2019s state secretary, Evan Moorhead. A spokeswoman said Howarth was unavailable when contacted for an interview with Guardian Australia this week. He has cited infrastructure as a key local need and taken credit for directly lobbying Abbott and then Turnbull to deliver a $1.5bn infrastructure spend in Petrie over the past three years. \u201cI speak up for Petrie,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI let [Canberra] know what it is that\u2019s important to them; I pass that on to the national leadership and I think it gets great results for the area, and I\u2019m keen to continue to do that.\u201d Zac, when told he could have the final word with a message to the nation\u2019s leaders, shrugs: \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 They\u2019re cocksuckers?\u201d More thoughtfully, he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Everyone on the street has a different story and a different outcome.\u201d Zac might not be interested in politics but politics says it\u2019s interested in him. By the time of the next federal election, when the effect of that interest on his aspirations for a life of suburban wellbeing will be much clearer, he\u2019ll be old enough to vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
