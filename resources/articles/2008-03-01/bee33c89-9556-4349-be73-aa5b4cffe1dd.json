But genius though he was, Favre spent his entire career with the gritty Green Bay Packers - as if Zidane had played non-stop for Newcastle. Indeed, if Favre played in Tampa or San Diego, he might not be retiring right now. The star quarterback instead plied his trade in the steppes of Green Bay in Wisconsin for 17 seasons, an eternity in the brutal world of the NFL, where replacement players are like shark's teeth - another one is always ready to move in when the current model shows any signs of wear. Playing on the \"frozen tundra\" of the NFL's iciest venue was always a major part of Favre's mystique, along with his penchant for athletic bravado and the soap operatic plot twists of his life off the pitch. Those who saw the NFC championship game this season, played in Siberian temperatures and beginning at twilight to satisfy television demands, witnessed a shivering, miserable Favre who looked every day of his 38 years. Favre and his team, the Packers, historically dominate in such dismal conditions, but on this occasion the New York Giants controlled most of the game, eventually winning in overtime after an awful Favre pass that was intercepted deep in Green Bay territory. That wounded duck now stands, sadly, as the last throw in a career filled with milestones. Few will remember that unfitting finish, and point instead to his career marks in touchdown passes, passing yards, and consecutive games started, not to mention his three straight Most Valuable Player awards and a Super Bowl ring. But unlike other storied field generals like Dan Marino or John Elway, the records never seemed to fit Favre. His game was more about style than statistics. Favre played with reckless abandon, a prerequisite for other positions in this most violent game but usually a non-starter for the quarterback, who must remain cool and process huge volumes of data before turning to athletic ability. Favre was the master of the improvised play, the flicked underhand toss to a last resort receiver, the rifled pass to a double-covered receiver that no one else would dare, the helmet-to-helmet head butt with an enemy defender, many of whom relished engaging Favre in game-long dialogue (this ability to rise above the simple us-versus-them mentality is one of Favre's most admired traits, but also spurred his most questionable moment--a game in 2002 when Favre turtled to the ground in front of Michael Strahan, allowing the defensive end to break the single season sack record in dubious fashion). Favre surely holds another, unofficial record: that of causing fans and media alike to respond to one of his walks on the tightrope with wordless laughter, struck mute by the sheer ballsiness of his play. If Favre is truly gone, it is this quality that will be missed most of all. I say \"if\" because I wouldn't be at all surprised were Favre to un-retire at some point, perhaps after mowing the grass at his Mississippi mansion and coming to the realization that yardwork doesn't quite carry the same adrenaline rush as professional sport. Favre's agent has made noises in recent days about his client feeling unappreciated by the team - standard agent speak in times of negotiation, suddenly taking on new meaning. And even though Favre has repeatedly stated that he cannot imagine playing for another team, stranger things have happened than a sudden transfer of loyalties. Naturally, I hope Favre truly has decided to saunter in his pigeon-toed walk offstage for good, although I will miss him as a fan of the game. Favre was required viewing any time he appeared on TV. Even a few years ago, as his prime began to recede, and many commentators clamored for him to step aside, his mistakes were often more interesting than the successes of others. This dynamic was all but forgotten after his remarkable renaissance in 2007, but the Favre of 2003 to 2006 was, in many respects, his true measure. The skills may have faded, but the spirit was there in full. That enthusiasm for the game is his legacy. Finally, it is gone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
