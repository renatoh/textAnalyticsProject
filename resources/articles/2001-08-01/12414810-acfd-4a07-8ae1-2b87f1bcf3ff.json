If a man lives by his pen, it's good news. If he's just an ordinary Joe, \"fury\" is what vengeful women turn on him (Furies, like Harpies, are always female). Pray the Erinyes never catch up with you, shears in hand, nails sharpened, writs written. I happened to see Salman Rushdie when he must have been writing this novel. It was at an international conference in LA on \"British Fiction 2000\". The organiser had brought along practitioners as well as dry-as-dust critics; Martin and Ian (but not, alas, Julian) were in attendance. And buzzing round these celebrity novelists were the paparazzi. Rushdie, of course, was not announced on the programme (some candidate for paradise may still be interested in that bounty). The great novelist came in, exquisitely dressed, accompanied by a beautiful companion - slim, Indian and, as a voice behind me moaned, \"half his age, lucky bastard\". While the cameras clicked there were poisonous whispers: \"Do you know he has a personal trainer nowadays?\" \"Every time he writes a novel, another publisher goes bust.\" \"Write a bad review, and he'll leave a rant on your answering machine - it happened to you-know-who on the you-know-what. He's going to sell the tape at Sotheby's.\" \"He's dedicating his next novel to her\" (he has - the rest, I believe, is untruth; most gossip is). I have to report that he looked serene; loftily above it all. But then, so does Etna until it erupts. Inwardly, one apprehends, Rushdie was seethingly furious. A couple of months later, he announced his departure from \"bitchy\" London for New York. This, then, is Rushdie's first American novel. But simply because history has deposited him in Manhattan doesn't mean he likes his new home any more than he liked \"Mrs Torcher's\" Britain. As he pictures New York, it's a circle of hell, metropolitan fury, wide-bore, full-volume: \"Garbage trucks like giant cockroaches moved through the city, roaring. He was never out of earshot of a siren, an alarm, a large vehicle's reverse-gear bleeps, the beat of some unbearable music.\" The noise, paradoxically, has a haven at its core. Who can hear one's own furious inner voices in that outward cacophony? The hero of this novel - speaking, one assumes, for his creator - wants America to \"eat me... and give me peace\". The US will oblige. The Statue of Liberty is a beast with a large belly. To summarise, which is never easy with Rushdie: the hero, Malik Solanka, is 55 (Rushdie's age). He was born in Bombay (ditto), on Methwold's Estate, off Warden Road (remember Midnight's Children?). In the 1980s, Malik gave up his tenured post at King's College, Cambridge (Rushdie's college), despairing of the \"narrowness, infighting and ultimate provincialism\" of academic life (the reasons, verbatim, that Rushdie gave us for leaving London). Malik went from academia into showbusiness, doing \"philosophical dolls\" for TV: half Wittgenstein, half Thunderbirds. He creates little people, who then take on a life of their own. They have succeeded brilliantly, apart from one episode that was judged \"blasphemous\" and got him into hot water. Malik's dolls have spawned a vast franchise industry - just like Star Wars (a favourite Rushdie movie, one gathers). He's loaded. Loaded, but unhappy. Malik has been married twice (like Rushdie) and has just, in the summer of 2000, left the second Mrs Solanka and his four-year-old child (let's leave the author's bio at this point; I suspect that he did as well). Malik's was an \"an ideal family\", but one night the \"demons\" got to him and he found himself hovering over his sleeping wife, carving knife in hand, Othello thoughts in mind. Why this homicidal impulse? The pressures of fame - or, as he puts it, those \"satanic dolls\" (get it?), which have poisoned him. Malik runs away - not from his family, but from what he might do to them. It is what alcoholics call a \"geographical cure\". As the novel begins, Solanka is holed up in an upper Westside duplex, doing a \"Mr Garbo\". It is this time last year (\"Gush v Bore\" are neck and neck in the polls; Gladiator is on the big screen, Euro 2000 on the small). The narrative is refracted through the consciousness of the fury-tormented protagonist. Not much happens. Malik drinks too much, and fires his Polish housekeeper. An anti-Semitic plumber fixes his toilet. He gets wrenching phone calls from his deserted wife, Eleanor, and little son, Asmaan. \"You abandoned us,\" she says, \"but we have not abandoned you. Come home, darling. Please come home.\" Alas, a \"power divorce\" is all that is on offer. Meanwhile, New York is chattering about a rash of cult murders, straight out of American Psycho. The killers dress in Disney clothes, bonk their beautiful victims with concrete after bonking them every other way, and scalp them. Malik has alcoholic blackouts and fears he may be a serial killer (\"if the knife was possible, so was this\"). Should he, like Tony Soprano, go to a shrink? \"Fuck him, he was fictional,\" Malik decides. He gets his cure instead from a gorgeous Serb, Mila Milo. \"The empress of West Seventieth Street\", Mila is a hardbodied computer whiz and incest-survivor. \"Some people do up houses,\" she announces. \"I renovate people.\" Mainly with blowjobs, which you won't get from your psychotherapist (although big Tony lives in hope). Mila helps, but Malik soon drops her in favour of some even more gorgeous totty, Neela, an Indian beauty. When she walks through Central Park, t'ai chi practitioners topple over, rollerbladers collide, dogs lift their back legs and forget to pee, joggers run into trees. She's also very smart. In one of its many aspects, this novel looks like one of literature's longer love letters. Malik Solanka is a version of his author, but he is also everyman. The fury which Rushdie analyses is universal in AD 2000 - flavour of the millennium. \"These days the goddesses, less regarded, were hungrier, wilder, casting their nets more widely. As the bonds of family weakened, so the Furies began to intervene in all of human life.\" It's your story too, reader. The narrative ends beautifully, with a recollection of the Larkin poem about mothers watching their kids in park playgrounds: \"Something is pushing them / To the side of their own lives\". Has he escaped the Furies? Are Malik's demons exorcised as he plays, united at last with Asmaan, on a bouncy-bouncy? The novel does not say. Rushdie is a very great novelist (our greatest - or is he now theirs?). Everything he writes has a tincture of that greatness. But wherein, it will be asked (more so in view of the current trend towards modish derogation of his work), lies this \"greatness\"? Specifically, what puts Fury in the class of, say, Midnight's Children or The Satanic Verses rather than his apprentice work, Grimus? The answer is not easy and is probably better left to judicious and unhurried literary criticism, rather than to the shooting-from-the-hip reflexes of the newspaper reviewer. My belief is that - in its eventual verdict - literary criticism will judge Rushdie as a novelist whose work, like that of Thomas Mann or D H Lawrence, is not easily divisible into \"novels\". What he is assembling, laboriously and inventively, is an oeuvre: a life-long structure. It is this that makes him, of all our practising novelists, less \"Bookerable\" than nobelabilis , as the French have it. This word - which, incidentally, Rushdie is fond of - means \"eligible for the big Swedish one; to hell with Martyn Goff\". Even so, Fury is a big surprise. Who would have expected this author to riff so wittily and sagaciously about the woe that is in marriage? \"Each marriage that breaks interrogates those that continue to hold... Are we still good? OK, how good? Are there things you're not telling me? Am I going to wake up one day and you'll say something that makes me realise I've been sharing my bed with a stranger? How will tomorrow rewrite yesterday, how will next week unmake the past five, 10, 15 years?\" For two out of five couples, statistics tell us, those rewrites happen. Only Rushdie rewrites so well. He is going very interesting places in his fiction. My advice? Go with him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
