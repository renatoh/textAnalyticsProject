From where we are eating (home) to where we are socialising (home) and where we spend all of our time now (the internet, mostly), it is all dictated by the pandemic. So it has already been noted \u2013 numerous times \u2013 that Julia Baird\u2019s book on how to cope with tough times could not have been more prescient. But I will note it again here, because you can\u2019t talk about the book (or anything, really) without referencing coronavirus. Phosphorescence \u2013 subtitled On Awe, Wonder and Things That Sustain You When the World Goes Dark \u2013 began to germinate when Baird was going through a particularly brutal heartbreak a few years ago and speaking with her counsellor about how to see a way through. A few years later Baird was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that could have killed her, which involved numerous operations and months at home. With two young children, Baird writes, her world \u201cnarrowed to a slit\u201d. But through it, she learned how to persevere. Not how to do something as twee as \u201cflourish\u201d during one of the toughest times in her life, but how to just keep putting one foot in front of the other. As we collectively feel the world as we know it shifting under our feet, from worrying about the mortality of our parents, and ourselves, to losing jobs it did not occur to us two months ago could be lost, there are a lot of us who need to hear how to simply make it through the day. \u201cIf someone said to me when I got diagnosed, \u2018Just go and sit under a tree and do some breathing\u2019 \u2013 you know, we don\u2019t do violence anymore, but you would want to punch them in that face. [This book] is really not meant to be that idea,\u201d she says over the phone (face-to-face interviews are not considered essential work). Baird mentions the Stockdale paradox, based on the experience of an American soldier who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for years and who survived it not by convincing himself it would be over soon, but by facing the reality of how terrible it was. Baird says you should be aware of the \u201ccrappy and brutal\u201d situation you find yourself in. \u201cBut you don\u2019t lose the faith that ultimately you will prevail, and that ultimately we will come out of it. The tide will turn,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, the world\u2019s not that bad\u2019. It\u2019s, \u2018Yeah, it is serious, serious stuff we have to deal with now in terms of global peril, let alone climate change and the future of the planet \u2013 and we have got a lot of work to do\u2019. And to get through it, you\u2019ve got to work out what makes you strong and tap into that. \u201cEveryone has their own thing,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor me it was pockets of calm and stillness, and prayer or meditation, and getting into the ocean. It doesn\u2019t mean the days aren\u2019t dark. It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t times where you totally despair and struggle to even have a grain of hope. It just means that you are deliberately pursuing things that give you strength, instead of thinking [that things] are serendipitously falling apart.\u201d The meticulous research throughout Phosphorescence is typical of Baird, who is a host of ABC\u2019s The Drum and the author of the internationally renowned biography Victoria: The Queen. She cites studies into the mental effects of blue space such as ocean and sky; forest bathing in Japan; storm chasing and philosophy. She references stoicism, with Descartes\u2019 explanation of rainbows threaded through her own experiences. Even without a global health pandemic to ground it, it is a stunning book. Some of the pillars she recommends include a more deliberate way of living, and getting out into nature. She writes about the importance of feeling small, stepping away from our phones and looking outwards, away from ourselves; and the joy of having lower expectations. But while it\u2019s full of strategies that could certainly help when you\u2019ve lost your job and are not allowed to hug your mother or have dinner with your friends, some of them feel impossible right now. A new hypervigilance has developed for a lot of us, as we track every development of the coronavirus on our phones, minute by minute. When we\u2019re not entranced by the news, our phones also carry all of our loved ones. How can we possibly put down our screens when it feels like we are watching the world end on them? Then talking about the world ending with our mates? \u201cYou cannot avoid the internet right now,\u201d Baird concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pipeline for the outside world \u2026 We need information, and we\u2019re not entirely sure who to believe \u2013 and people keep contradicting themselves. So we\u2019re doing all these mental gymnastics every time we hop on.\u201d But there are benefits too. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of community and beautiful stuff happening online as well. This reminds us that for the first time in centuries we\u2019re really facing a common threat globally. And it\u2019s amazing to watch people respond to that. \u201cThis will [leave] a massive psychic scar. It\u2019s a huge death toll, there will be rage at negligence, at lack of foresight, at incompetence. I don\u2019t know what can come from that \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen people act online the way they are acting now.\u201d Baird chose the title to allude not to the brilliance of light, but the process of storing it for gradual release. \u201cI don\u2019t mean for people to light up and be sparkly; it\u2019s not [about being] covered in glitter and sequins,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a long time, phosphorescent things take in the light of the sun, right? And then they emit that very slowly for a long time afterwards.\u201d Baird writes about losing her appetite and not being able to sleep after a heartbreak, and calling her counsellor in tears saying she did not know how she was going to get through. He told her he had once said the same thing to his mentor, who slapped him, and said, \u201cIt is now that everything you have been given in your life matters; this is what you draw on. Your parents, your friends, your work, your books \u2013 everything you have ever been told, everything you have ever learned, this is when you use that.\u201d \u201cI was trying to share that sense as well,\u201d Baird says. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018how do you leap and bound after serious trauma?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018how do you keep putting one foot after the other, or at least just moving your toes\u2019.\u201d Phosphorescence: On Awe, Wonder and Things That Sustain You When the World Goes Dark is out now via Fourth Estate/Harper Collins ($32.99; $19.99 as eBook) Read more about Guardian Australia\u2019s Unmissable series"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
