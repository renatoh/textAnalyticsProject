City were knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday by Barcelona for a second successive year at the last-16 stage. If Chelsea are not caught in the Premier League \u2013 they are six points ahead with a match in hand \u2013 City will end the season without a trophy. Asked if his players should accept some of the blame for the uneven campaign, Pellegrini said: \u201cAlways it will be my responsibility because I choose the starting XI, I choose the squad and I choose the way we like to play. I am very happy not to change our style of play because I don\u2019t think that you can try to arrive at [the next stage in another way]. So I don\u2019t have any complaints about that. \u201cI have a very good relationship with the players, always they try to give their best and, I repeat, we are not doing as bad as everyone has tried to demonstrate. We can do better, especially in cups this year \u2013 that was not good \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I have anything to complain about.\u201d During the 1-0 loss at Burnley last Saturday some City fans turned on the players. \u201cI don\u2019t think that against Burnley you can have a lack of effort if you have 70% possession of the ball ,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWhen they have just one chance, with a beautiful goal, you must work to do that. We are not in a creative moment and maybe we are not playing well but I never think that the players don\u2019t want to do it \u2013 they always want to do it.\u201d After winning last season\u2019s title having been nine points behind with two games in hand on Liverpool, Pellegrini agreed that this could be an inspiration for his players to attempt a similar feat. \u201cAt least we must try,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe last year nobody gave us the merit we deserve because we always had [played] games less, but it\u2019s not easy when you have games in hand and you have to make up nine points. You must fight against that pressure and you must win those games to have the same amount of points. \u201cFor me it\u2019s always very important to have the character and personality to fight to the end, until it is mathematically impossible. The best way to do it is to play every game as a final, and we will see if we have the same mentality as we did last year.\u201d Pellegrini admitted it will be difficult to reinvigorate the squad for Saturday\u2019s home match against West Bromwich Albion following the loss to Bar\u00e7a . \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to pick your players up when you don\u2019t win, it doesn\u2019t matter which competition it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must have a strong personality and recover as quickly as we can. \u201cAs I said to the players, we are still in this competition, we have nine games left and we must try to play well and try to do what we must for this team, which is to stay in second position and \u2013 I repeat \u2013 never give up, because in football anything can happen, so we will fight to retain the title to the end.\u201d Pressed if it was acceptable to say that if you draw Barcelona then you are out of the Champions League, Pellegrini said: \u201cIt can happen that you can win or you can lose when you play against this kind of team. It\u2019s different when you lose a game against a team with less power than Barcelona. But it\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s never an excuse.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
