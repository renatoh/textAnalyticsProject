But despite boarding the plane to central America, Cahill offered no promise that he would be fit enough to play the fourth-placed team from Concacaf, as he recovers from a rolled ankle sustained on club duty with Melbourne City. Sporting a strapped and iced ankle at Melbourne airport, he said he had an \u201coutside chance\u201d of playing. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not going to promise anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a calculated decision and if it works, it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The striker said two of his own independent physios had been working on his ankle for the past 48 hours to help him recover. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s squad have completed club duties in 15 countries across the weekend, and are heading to Honduras for Friday\u2019s (Saturday AEDT) away leg in the intercontinental playoff. Collectively, the Socceroos will travel around 200,000 kilometres from their club homes to Honduras. It might seem like a disadvantage when the majority of the Honduras squad are based at home, but Australian officials hope their meticulous planning can give them an edge. The longest route is from Melbourne to San Pedro Sula and has already been undertaken by Postecoglou and James Troisi on Sunday and Cahill on Monday, after his travel was delayed by a day to aid his recovery. The shortest \u2013 by Mitch Langerak, based with Levante in the Spanish city of Valencia \u2013 still took the best part of a day\u2019s travel. But the Socceroos are used to it. Their journey to the World Cup has already taken in 20 games, with away days in Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Jordan, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. No country will have had to face a longer or more arduous route to Russia. But Mark Milligan, who is suspended for the first leg like Mathew Leckie and won\u2019t travel to Honduras, has no doubt their Asian experiences would galvanise the team. \u201cThe boys have a lot of travel ahead of them but that\u2019s one thing we\u2019re very good at,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff prepare us very well to deal with that. The way that we prepare for flights and get ready; the recovery when we get in. We do it a lot and our mentality towards it is never negative. We know we have to and we get on with it. \u201cIf you\u2019re not used to travelling across the world all the time it can play on your mind and it can make things tough. We accept it. We know we\u2019re getting looked after from the medical staff and we trust in what they\u2019re telling us. That helps the mental side. The travel will be a definite advantage for us.\u201d Milligan will take the 90-minute flight from Melbourne to Sydney to link up with the squad next week for the second leg. But he said that didn\u2019t mean that he, Leckie and Robbie Kruse, who will also miss the first leg because of an injured knee, would be walk-up starters at ANZ Stadium. \u201cWe never know who\u2019s going to be playing,\u201d Milligan said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
