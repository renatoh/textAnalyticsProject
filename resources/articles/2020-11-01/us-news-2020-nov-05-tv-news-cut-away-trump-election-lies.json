Several US news networks cut their feeds of the 16-minute speech, and numerous Republicans condemned the many falsehoods proclaimed in it. MSNBC halted its live stream of the speech just a few minutes in, with host Brian Williams saying: \u201cHere we are again in the unusual position of not only interrupting the president of the United States but correcting the president of the United States. \u201cIt was not rooted in reality \u2013 and at this point, where our country is, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d On Friday morning, the Pennsylvania Republican senator Pat Toomey told NBC: \u201cThe president\u2019s allegations of large-scale fraud and theft of the election are just not substantiated. I\u2019m not aware of any significant wrongdoing here.\u201d As the president spoke the evening before, CNBCalso cut away from Trump\u2019s remarks, to anchor Shep Smith who said: \u201cWhat the president of the United States is saying, in large part, is absolutely untrue.\u201d And the Associated Press \u2013 which the Guardian relies on to project election results \u2013 swiftly clarified that it \u201chas not declared a winner in the presidential race, with several states still too early to call\u201d. The speech came as former Vice-President Joe Biden was ahead in the electoral college and ballots in key states continues to be counted. While many Republicans have avoided commenting on the president\u2019s false claims of victory and undemocratic assertion that votes should not be counted, several did speak out on Thursday night, urging patience as the ballots are counted. Chris Christie became the first major Trump ally to chastise the president for falsely claiming that the election is being stolen from him. \u201cShow us the evidence,\u201d he said on ABC News. \u201cWe heard nothing today about evidence.\u201d Paul Mitchell, a Republican congressman of Michigan, said: \u201cEvery legal vote should and will be counted \u2013 as they always are.\u201d \u201cAnything less harms the integrity of our elections and is dangerous for our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cCounting every vote is at the heart of democracy,\u201d tweeted Mitt Romney, the senator of Utah and former Republican presidential candidate. \u201cThat process is often long and, for those running, frustrating. The votes will be counted.\u201d Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, tweeted there was \u201cno defense for the president\u2019s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process\u201d, while Tom Ridge, the former secretary of homeland security under George W Bush, said the speech \u201cdisrespected every single American who figured out a way to safely vote amid a pandemic\u201d. Will Hurd, the Republican congressman of Texas, said: \u201cA sitting president undermining our political process and questioning the legality of the voices of countless Americans without evidence is not only dangerous and wrong, it undermines the very foundation this nation was built upon. Every American should have his or her vote counted.\u201d Joe Biden also responded shortly after the speech, saying, \u201cNo one is going to take our democracy from us\u201d, while his running mate, Kamala Harris, said Trump \u201cis trying to invalidate these ballots\u201d. Meanwhile, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper had perhaps the most bruising words of the night: \u201cThat is the most powerful person in the world and we see him like an obese turtle on his back, flailing in the hot sun, realizing his time is over.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
