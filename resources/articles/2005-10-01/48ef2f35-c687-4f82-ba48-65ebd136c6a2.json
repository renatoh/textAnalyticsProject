It is one of those cultural theories that is hard to prove, though a surprising number of people have brought it up since. I think it is valid - I always have - but perhaps my awareness of that element was reinforced on a recent trip to Brazil. I was there to make a documentary and what I saw in a fortnight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia was uplifting and depressing. But what came across most forcefully is the way football and culture are entwined in Brazil. Domestically football is in a mess. This is a country where clubs are not required to fill in tax returns and consequently the game has been raped economically. How are they going to rectify this, to restore financial stability to clubs teetering on the edge of extinction? Launch a national lottery, that's what. A bill is already in parliament and it will be passed. It would be dismissed as a ridiculous idea in Britain; in Brazil it is happening. Football is a whole different ball game over there. I spoke to a range of people, from Brazil's manager Carlos Alberto Perreira, Aldo Rebello, the leader of congress, Cafu, the captain at the 2002 World Cup-winning team, to the man in the street, and the overriding impression given is of the importance of football to daily life. What a bloke Cafu is. From the Jardim Irene favela - one of the most squalid shanties in Sao Paulo, and where we were informed undertakers do very well - he retains a special bond with those he left behind. If you recall, Cafu wore his favela T-shirt when lifting the World Cup. He spoke eloquently of the meaning of football in his country, and the spectacular gulf between rich and poor. Often living side by side, the disparity is alarming and its presence influences the way Brazilians perceive the game. The Rio-based journalist Tim Vickery observed that the beauty of a trick by a Brazilian player represents a form of liberation from the daily grind. Having been to a couple of games, I understand what he means. The Brazil team of Zico and Socrates may not have won a World Cup, but the urgent feeling about that side still shows an appreciation of football beyond trophies. A back-heel is a trophy in itself in Brazilian football, though if it leads to a goal it is cherished all the more. Watching Brazil go 4-0 up in 25 minutes against Chile in Brasilia - the match when they qualified for the World Cup finals - the beauty and effect came together. Their fourth goal began at their own corner flag, featured Beckham-like passes from Robinho and Adriano, a dummy from Kaka when he looked certain to score, another from Ronaldo when he received Kaka's pass, and a tap-in from Robinho. Six Chileans were left on the ground; it was like a scene from a spaghetti western. Unfortunately there are other spaghetti-western aspects to Brazil. Last Sunday a fan was shot dead at a Corinthians match and, in my fortnight alone, the police shot dead 23 people. Economic desperation has led to the kidnapping of players' relatives and the value of Brazil footballers in Europe has led to the collapse of credibility in the professional domestic leagues. The absence of regulations, which I doubt will be rectified by the lottery, has led to a situation where clubs do not own the players. The latest off the production line, Robinho, joined Real Madrid from Santos for a reported \u00a322m last summer. But Santos do not get that as a fee; they receive \"undisclosed compensation\" as Robinho was under contract to the club but it is agents who own his registration and have profited most from the move. The Santos game after he left was attended by 4,500 fans. Sad and chaotic describe Brazilian football. But the passion inside the chaos is magical. And I think the magic jerseys might just win another World Cup. The Boys From Brazil, Sky One, 9pm this evening"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
