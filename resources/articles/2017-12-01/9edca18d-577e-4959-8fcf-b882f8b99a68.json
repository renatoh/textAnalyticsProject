Erie, Pennsylvania was the place to be this year, where a whopping 86cm (34in) of snow fell on Christmas Day. This 24-hour snowfall shattered the previous Christmas record (20cm) and even broke the all-time snowiest day in the city\u2019s history (51cm) on 22 November 1956. Officials declared a state of emergency and the incessant snow delivered a further 62cm on Boxing Day, bringing the final total to a massive 149cm. This staggering event was all thanks to \u201clake effect snow\u201d. This phenomenon needs cold air to flow over relatively warm water (in this case Lake Erie), creating bands of snow showers that continually feed over the same location for an extended period of time. Typhoon Tembin threatened Vietnam but the country was relieved after the storm passed on a less harmful track just to the south of the country. The typhoon dissipated on Boxing Day in the Gulf of Thailand after reaching peak intensity on Christmas Eve just west of the Philippines. Almost 1 million people were prepared for evacuation, of whom 70,000 were forced to move away from low-lying areas. At least 250 people have been killed as Tembin ripped through the Philippines and more than 100 are still missing. The typhoon brought large rain totals and many bridges and roads were destroyed by landslides. Hundreds of residents in north-western Australia lost power after tropical cyclone Hilda tracked along the Kimberley coast on Tuesday and Wednesday. Strong winds of 60mph have brought down trees and more than 15cm of rain poured down on the Dampier Peninsula, north of Broome in Western Australia. This is the third tropical cyclone to form in the Australian region\u2019s cyclone season. The season officially started on 1 November and will finish on 30 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
