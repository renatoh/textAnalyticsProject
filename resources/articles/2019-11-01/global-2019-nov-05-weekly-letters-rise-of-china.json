From where I sit China is likely the winner. In any game it is the weight of numbers that finally counts. When I was with a party being conducted around the Ming tombs, the guide told a story about one of the Ming emperors. The emperor\u2019s admiral had just returned from a exploratory voyage along the east coast of Africa. When the admiral presented his charts to the emperor, the emperor ordered the charts to be burnt. He was quite happy with the Middle Kingdom the way it was. Val Wake Lod\u00e8ve, France \u2022 Ever since empires and conquest were replaced by nation states and capitalism the pattern of history has been clear: political power follows the money. So unless the pattern of the last 500 years of the capitalist era is disrupted, there is no stopping the rise of China to become the 21st-century superpower. The only potential disrupter to this pattern is not a reborn US under a post-Trump president, or a European miracle or a punching-above-its-weight Russia or a lack of democratic legitimacy in China; it is, of course, the impact of global heating. China will dominate the remainder of this century, providing a variety of capitalism can be created that stabilises global heating and renews our ecological systems. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Coping with climate crisis should be our priority The report about the 20 major emitters of carbon dioxide in the world is noteworthy (The Polluters, 18 October). However, the main interest should not be in finding the culprits of climate crisis, but in illustrating the foundations of the world economy and the challenges society faces. The companies included in the list are oil companies, some of which are owned by the state, others by private investors. The world economy depends on burning fossil fuels to obtain energy. One solution for significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be to live under ascetic conditions, which it is not likely to be very popular. In any case, moving from fossil fuels to renewable sources would require not only boosting the amount of energy from alternative sources, but perhaps devising a new world economic model, which is much easier said than done. J C Echeverria Pamplona, Spain \u2022 Extinction Rebellion\u2019s energetic campaigning is commendable (11 October), but will be counter-productive if its aims remain limited to relying on politicians to provide solutions. Over the decades solutions have been advocated by many people, including Paul and Anne Ehrlich (Zero Population Growth), EF Schumacher (Small is Beautiful) and, in Australia, Ted Trainer (Developing to Death). Had their ideas and proposals been embraced, many of the planet\u2019s crises may have been averted or, at the very least, greatly reduced. The common thread running through these people is holism and an understanding of the need for limits: both lacking in much of environmentalism today. For example, we frequently hear the demand for zero carbon emissions and 100% renewables, but rarely for reducing energy demand. We need an overview that rejects the prevailing pro-growth, anti-ecological paradigm and the inevitable kneejerk reactions to each crisis. Simply demanding that politicians act is futile in the face of collapse: it is very late in the day. Ally Fricker Brady Creek, South Australia Veganism can be seen as an attack on our traditions George Reynolds, in The war on vegans (1 November), cites fear as an underlying factor in hostility towards those who embrace an animal-free way of life. He could go a bit further with this theme. Meat-eating symbolises humans\u2019 domination of nature, and it is also integral to celebrations of togetherness (at Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas). No wonder, then, that many feel threatened by veganism, which undermines these structures of meaning. The good news is that humans can move beyond dominionism. And there are alternative kinds of feasts to bond with others. Michael Allen Fox Teneriffe, Queensland, Australia"}, "isHosted": false}}}
