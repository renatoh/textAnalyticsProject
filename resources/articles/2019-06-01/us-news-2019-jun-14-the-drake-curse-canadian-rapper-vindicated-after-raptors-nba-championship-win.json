But one historic basketball game may have broken the curse. High-profile victims of the so-called \u201cDrake curse\u201d include Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose team lost to Everton three days after meeting the Canadian rapper in London, and Paris Saint-Germain, who had their biggest loss in almost two decades after defender Layvin Kurzawa posed for a picture with him. Also, boxer Anthony Joshua was so confident before his fight with Andy Ruiz Jr that he posted a photo with Drake on Instagram with the caption \u201c\u2018bout to break the curse\u201d \u2013 only to subsequently lose to his little-known rival. Such is the extent of Drake\u2019s reputation for bringing bad luck that AS Roma enforced a tongue-in-cheek ban on its players taking pictures with the star until the end of the season. But following the Toronto Raptors\u2019 historic 114-110 win over the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night, which made them the first ever Canadian NBA champions, Drake\u2019s cursed influence appears \u2013 for now at least \u2013 to be over. Following the game, an exultant Drake, a Raptors mega-fan who, as the official global ambassador of his hometown team, has been a court-side fixture throughout the finals, declared the curse null and void. Wearing a 2019 champions baseball cap he said: \u201cThey said I was a curse, now they cursing each other out.\u201d As well as announcing that he would be releasing not one but two songs to celebrate the victory \u2013 Omert\u00e0 and Money in the Grave (ft. Rick Ross), he took the opportunity to gloat to Warriors guard Klay Thompson. \u201cYo Klay! when you\u2019re wakeboarding this summer in your Quicksilver shorts \u2026when you see me, you better wave. Friendly, too,\u201d he said. His erratic \u2013 and highly meme-able \u2013 court-side posturing and emotional outbursts during the playoffs have attracted almost as much attention as the players on court. Drake taunted opposing players, wore provocative clothing, gesticulated wildly and even gave Raptors\u2019 coach Nick Nurse a quick shoulder rub. Drake described the Raptors\u2019 win as \u201cpoetic\u201d. And said: \u201cWe did this off of heart. We did this off of love. We willed this into existence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
