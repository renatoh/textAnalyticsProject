Swings of up to 20% were recorded in outer-suburban seats in Perth, while swings of more than 11% were recorded in 14 previously Liberal-held seats \u2013 securing a Labor 34 seats in the 59-seat parliament. The number of seats declared for Labor was expected to increase to 41 as counting continued, more than double the number the party previously held. It took just over an hour for pundits to declare the election, with the outgoing premier, Colin Barnett, conceding defeat by 8.30pm local time, just two-and-a-half hours after the polls closed. The federal Liberal party frontbencher Michael Keenan, speaking on ABC24, labelled it a \u201csavage result\u201d. The Liberal party\u2019s primary vote dropped 16.1% across the state. The Barnett government ministers Albert Jacob, John Day and Andrea Mitchell lost their seats, despite sitting on healthy margins, along with a host of other senior Liberal figures including the Speaker, Michael Sutherland. Addressing an elated crowd at the Rockingham community centre at 9pm, McGowan, flanked by his wife, Sarah, and their three children, said WA had voted for \u201chope and opportunity over desperation and division\u201d. \u201cToday we showed we are a state of decency and intelligence, not a state of stupidity and ignorance,\u201d he said. McGowan said Labor had \u201cshown the way for the rest of the country\u201d. \u201cThe core Australian values of equality, fairness, merit and opportunity shone through in this election campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are West Australian values, and they are Labor\u2019s values.\u201d Labor campaigned on a platform of opposing the controversial Perth Freight Link and the proposed sale of 51% of Western Power, and promised to reduce the state\u2019s mounting debt \u2013 which is tipped to reach $41bn by 2020 \u2013 by diversifying the state\u2019s economy and curbing spending. It has also promised to build a $2.5bn urban rail project, dubbed Metronet, and to invest in social policies. McGowan was elected to parliament in 1996 and became opposition leader in 2012. He moved to Western Australian in 1988 as a legal officer in the Australian navy, stationed in Rockingham. \u201cI love this place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s done more for me than I can ever repay. I came here 27 years ago in my Corolla across the Nullarbor, and today the people of Western Australia have made me premier. Thank you.\u201d He also acknowledged Barnett\u2019s contribution to the state and thanked him for \u201chis many years of public service\u201d. A clearly emotional Barnett told Liberal party faithful in a concession speech at Cottesloe that they had run \u201ca great campaign\u201d but had faced a difficult task in convincing the public to give them a third term. \u201cTo me, the overwhelming factor was time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is a phenomena I guess, particularly in Australian politics, that the electorate, the voters, only give a government, a people, a certain amount of time.\u201d The Barnett government, which was in a loose coalition with the National party of WA, had governed for eight and a half years, during a turbulent period in which Australia had five prime ministers. \u201cWhen we won the election in 2008 and I became the state\u2019s 29th premier, I made some commitments,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cSome to myself and some I made publicly. The one I made to myself was that I would give it my best shot. Maybe that wasn\u2019t good enough but, I assure you, I have given it my best shot in every sense.\u201d Earlier on Saturday Barnett refused to comment on whether a preference deal with Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party had turned voters away from the Liberal party. Hanson, whose party appeared on track on Saturday night to pick up one upper house seat, said it was clear that voters were sick of Barnett. She suggested Barnett\u2019s unpopularity had hurt One Nation\u2019s vote, which was tracking at 4.5% \u2013 about half the level of support predicted in the polls. The National party of WA, which was predicted to take a double hit from both One Nation and industry backlash from its proposed mining tax, gained ground in some regional seats while others swung towards Labor. The party leader, Brendon Grylls, said on Saturday night that his seat was too close to call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
