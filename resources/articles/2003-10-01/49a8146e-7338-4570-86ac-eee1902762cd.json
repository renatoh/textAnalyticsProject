James Abbott jumped to his mother's defence in a radio phone-in, saying it was his choice to attend the City of London School. \"She's not a hypocrite, she just put what I wanted first,\" he told LBC. Ms Abbott was criticised by teachers' unions and opposition MPs for sending her son to a private school, after speaking out herself when the solicitor general, Harriet Harman, and Tony Blair both sent their children to the selective London Oratory school. But according to 12-year-old James, his mother did not force him to attend the school, he made the decision himself. \"My Mum didn't force me to go to private school, I took the test for the schools I wanted to go to, and I chose the school I wanted to go to,\" he said in the phone in. \"If I wanted to go to a state school then my Mum would have let me go to a state school,\" he said. Defending his choice he said: \"It's a good school. The facilities, the resources and the teachers seem better than the state school. My Mum said you can go to whatever school you want, she didn't say you have to go to a private school, or you have to go to a state school.\" The MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, who became Britain's first black woman MP in 1987, has so far refused to speak out about her decision to reject schools in her constituency for the all-boys City of London School. A spokesperson for Ms Abbott today confirmed that the radio caller was her son."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
