A bit rich considering Steff seems to have her own head buried in a book, specifically a rhyming dictionary: \u201cWhy you always got your phone in your hand?\u201d she asks. \u201cI swear it\u2019s feeling like I ain\u2019t got a man / I just want to take it, run it over with a van.\u201d WITH A VAN. Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello Se\u00f1orita You know I Know What You Did Last Summer, what Shawn and Camila did four summers ago? For the sequel \u2013 with Cashmere Cat, Benny Blanco, Charli XCX and Jack off Clean Bandit among this song\u2019s cast of thousands \u2013 the Gen Z Sandy and Danny relate the story of a holiday romance that begins with indecisiveness on Shawn\u2019s part (\u201cIt felt like ooh-la-la-la \u2013 yeah, no\u201d) and ends, as I suppose these things sometimes do, with intercourse in a hotel room. In fragile masculinity news, the giveaway that the chorus was originally written for a solo female artist is the \u201cI love it when you call me se\u00f1orita\u201d chorus hook, where you can hear Shawn\u2019s voice suddenly drop out on the \u201cme\u201d. Zara Larsson All the Time Check out Zara Larsson\u2019s new Daft Punk-referencing single All the Time if you get the chance. Sound of the summer. ThisisNAMASTE Exactly What You Want Has a former Rita Ora backing vocalist and the daughter of two dentists (???) gone and knocked out one of the sturdiest pop debuts of the year? Quite possibly, but the main point is that ThisisNAMASTE seems like a ropey pop star moniker until you realise her real name is Natasha Marie Stewart, and that a pop career involving the word \u201cnamaste\u201d was inevitable and, I would argue, compulsory. Freddie Mercury Time Waits for No One The story behind this is so boring it will make you yearn for the excitement of a 19-hour Live Aid reconstruction, but long story short: this originally came out decades ago and they have twiddled around with old vocals, invented a new version and given it artwork resembling a meme your mum shares on Facebook. I was intending to use this space for a spirited defence of I Was Born to Love You, ie the best song Fredreth ever made, but to be honest I\u2019m still reeling from that Stefflon Don lyric about the van."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
