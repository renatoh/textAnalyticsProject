Really, it is. Okay, so it's no fun completing endless applications when the only form your best friend has to fill in is their ski-break reservation. And no, it ain't no fun trudging to interview after interview when the air is cold and damp and contaminated with crappy pop carols. And yes, we accept that it hardly feels like the season to be merry when you open the post only to find yet another rejection letter inside. But - and you knew there was one coming - this is the time to celebrate. Even if you don't feel like partying, other people do and you would be well advised to join them. Why? Because these get-togethers are the perfect place to meet people - the sort of people who may just be recruiting or know of someone else who may just be recruiting. And that contact could make all the difference to you landing your first big career break. But how exactly do you master all this? 1. Be there Think lateral about the sorts of events you could get yourself invited to. Do you belong to a recre ational organisation? Are you a student member of a professional body? Is your university holding a lunch that you could attend? Did you do work experience at a company that you could revisit? Is there a charity 'do' that will attract the sort of people who could be useful to you? Could you accompany one of your friends or family members to a gathering they are going to? Remember, don't be shy and don't wait to be asked; just politely put yourself forward. Go on. You can do it. 2. Be active Once you have managed to get yourself to a festive function the next step is to work it. Yes, that's right, work it. Proactively seek people out. Introduce yourself. Mix. Mingle. And be tactical about it; if a particular conversation doesn't seem to be going anywhere helpful, pick your moment to move on to another one. Always bear in mind that beneficial connections will not just come your way. You will have to find them. 3. Be professional Of course it's not just enough to press a lot of flesh; you need to do it in the correct way in order to make the right impression. \u00b7 Be calm; take a deep breath, pull your shoulders back, raise your head up and smile. \u00b7 Be discreet; carefully approach a group or individual. \u00b7 Be direct; state that you are a graduate, currently looking for an opportunity. \u00b7 Be positive; note how much you enjoyed your degree and why it is that you are looking forward to getting started in your chosen field. \u00b7 Be quiet; just as important as talking about yourself is listening to what others have to say. Ask intelligent questions and really pay close attention to how they reply. Only by doing this will you discover whether someone could be in a position to assist you. 4. Be strategic When you do hit on a connection, maximise it. You could do this at the time. Try \"That's of interest to me - could you tell me a little bit more?\" Alternatively, see if you could discuss this further, once they are back at their desk. Try \"Would you mind if I gave you a quick call to ask you just a few questions about that?\" In either case, always send a short email saying how much you enjoyed meeting them and that you hope to see them again at some point in the future. This will help to build on your relationship and keep open that all-important 'communication channel'. 5. Be persistent Networking can be trying and tiring. And it comes with no guarantees. After a whole evening of shaking hands and making toasts you may be no closer to clinching that job. But keep on keeping on. Not only will networking become easier and more natural but, chances are, you will meet someone who is looking to hire a graduate just like you or who can at least give you an introduction to a peer in that position. 6. Be happy Relax at some point. Allow yourself to enjoy yourself. No-one likes a person who is too serious and too earnest and too eager to sell themselves and their skills. So be at ease. Have a laugh. It is Christmas after all... barbara@creative-industry.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
