Kanye West accessorised his Brits performance with 77 bikini-clad golden ladies. There were only meant to be 76, but Kanye met a girl the night before and liked her so much he invited her to appear. What a playa! Kate Moss got down and dirty in a New York strip club with new chum Lindsay Lohan in January. She jumped on stage, Lindsay in hot pursuit, for a pole-dancing session. An onlooker said, 'They were swinging on the pole with their arms around each other's waists, kissing and caressing... acting like strippers.' Bless. Dannii Minogue has also been snapped indulging in a lap dance - at the Puss in Boots club in Mayfair. Though Dannii's spokesman reassured everyone it was a 'harmless girls' night out'. Not to be outdone, the usually demure Pamela Anderson so impressed Kanye (yes, him again) on the dancefloor at a New Year's Eve party that he requested she pole-dance on stage for him some time. And stars virtually threw themselves at Tom Ford when he guest edited the March issue of Vanity Fair. Scarlett, Keira, Sienna and Angelina all disrobed for the issue. Steamy moments are essential for starlets, you see. It's indisputable proof that they're sexy, daring and... out of your league. You can look, but you can't touch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
