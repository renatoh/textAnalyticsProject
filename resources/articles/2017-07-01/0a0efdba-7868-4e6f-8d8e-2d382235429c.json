After raising hopes she could become the first British woman to triumph at SW19 since Virginia Wade in 1977, Konta produced a disappointing performance against her 37-year-old American opponent, who rolled back the years to win 6-4, 6-2 in 73 minutes on Centre Court and set up a final with Spain\u2019s Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. Yet the British No1 preferred to stay positive afterwards, saying that the level of her tennis over the past fortnight proves she is on the right track. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with how I was physically and mentally able to hold up this past grass-court season,\u201d Konta said. \u201cI did play every week. I stayed healthy and I stayed mentally quite fresh. \u201cThat only strengthens my belief that, if I\u2019m ever in a position to be involved in a slam for the full fortnight, I will be able to keep myself in that mental and physical state to be able to deal with hopefully one day playing for a title. \u201cI would like to be sitting here enjoying the fact that I would be playing here on Saturday. That is my preference. But I think I\u2019ve also got to acknowledge the level of how my opponent played today. She was just better than me. I need to take the good things that I did but I\u2019m also very aware of the things I can do better. I\u2019m more than anything looking forward to working on those.\u201d The 26-year-old agreed the five-times Wimbledon champion possessed too much experience. \u201cDefinitely. This was my second grand slam semi-final. It was her 202nd, I bet, so she definitely came into the match with a lot more experience than I did. I think I was in with just as much of a shot of winning this tournament here. I think today it came down to the day and Venus played better than me. That\u2019s really all I can say.\u201d There was no reason for Konta to be too downhearted, however, bearing in mind that her run to the last four will catapult the world No7 into the top five when the new rankings are released on Monday. \u201cI think I definitely have a lot more to improve on. There\u2019s a lot of exciting things that I can still get better at, which is exciting for me and exciting for my team, and my own development. But I definitely feel like there\u2019s no reason why I would not be able to be in a position to win a title like this one day.\u201d Williams, who had not reached the final since 2009, praised Konta\u2019s efforts. \u201cShe played an amazing tournament,\u201d the 10th seed said. \u201cShe showed a lot of courage, played in tough situations against players who were in form. I feel like she wants these majors; she\u2019ll have an opportunity.\u201d But not on Saturday. Williams will be the slight favourite against Muguruza, who destroyed Magdalena Rybarikova in the first semi-final. Muguruza, the 14th seed, lost against Serena Williams in the 2015 final, and Venus will ask her younger sister for some pointers. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to give me some things that will make a difference for me in the match,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
