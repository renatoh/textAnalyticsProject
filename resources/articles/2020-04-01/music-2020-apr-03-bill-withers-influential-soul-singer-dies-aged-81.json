Withers wrote and recorded several other major hits including Use Me and Just the Two of Us, before retiring in the mid-1980s and staying out of the public eye. He is survived by his wife Marcia Johnson and their two children, Todd and Kori. The family statement reads: We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world. In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones. Lin-Manuel Miranda was among those paying tribute, writing: \u201cRest In Peace, maestro Bill Withers. What a legacy.\u201d Chance the Rapper said Withers \u201cwas really the greatest\u201d, while Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers described him as \u201cclass, class and more class\u201d. Withers\u2019 songs are some of the most beloved in the American songbook. Ain\u2019t No Sunshine is regarded as one of the all-time great breakup tracks, while Lean on Me, an ode to the supportive power of friendship, was performed at the inaugurations of presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Heavily influenced by the church hymns and gospel music of his childhood, it was his first and only No 1 single on the US Billboard pop charts, in 1972. It has also become an anthem during the coronavirus outbreak, sung by schoolchildren and in impromptu balcony renditions to show support for one another. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka wrote on Twitter: \u201cThere is no more appropriate time to reflect on his words than now as we lean on each other.\u201d Just the Two of Us, another song of solidarity, was successfully covered by Will Smith and sampled by Eminem (as well as being spoofed by Bill Cosby and Mike Myers). The joyous Lovely Day, with its signature 18-second-long held note, was his only UK Top 10 hit, reaching No 7 in 1977 and No 4 in 1988. Withers also won three Grammy awards from nine nominations and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Born William Harrison Withers Jr in 1938, he faced a difficult childhood in Slab Fork, West Virginia. A stutter held him back from making friends, and, after his father died when Bill was 13, his grandmother helped to raise him. Withers would write a tribute to her with the song Grandma\u2019s Hands from his 1971 debut album Just As I Am: \u201cGrandma\u2019s hands / Used to issue out a warning / She\u2019d say, \u2018Billy don\u2019t you run so fast / Might fall on a piece of glass / Might be snakes there in that grass.\u2019\u201d The intro was memorably sampled by Blackstreet for their 1996 R&amp;B classic, No Diggity. Withers spent nine years in the US Navy before pursuing a career in music. After moving to Los Angeles in 1967, he found a job making toilet seats and recorded demos through the night. Possessed of a smooth and soulful baritone, he signed to Sussex Records and enlisted Booker T Jones to produce Just As I Am. That album spawned the hit Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, which won Withers his first Grammy for best R&amp;B song. He then poured his experiences of growing up in Slab Fork, a tough coal-mining town with a strong community ethos, into Lean on Me. His time with Sussex Records didn\u2019t end well. \u201cThey weren\u2019t paying me,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2015. \u201cThey looked at me and said, \u2018So, I owe you some money, so what?\u2019 I was socialised in the military. When some guy is smushing my face down, it doesn\u2019t go down well.\u201d He claims to have erased an entire album that he had recorded for the label in a fit of pique. \u201cI could probably have handled that differently,\u201d he said. Withers signed with Columbia Records and married his second wife, Marcia Johnson, shortly afterwards, in 1976; she eventually became his manager. Withers continued having hit records with Columbia, including the laid-back and optimistic Lovely Day. After three albums in three years, Withers claimed Columbia\u2019s head of A&amp;R, Mickey Eichner, prevented him from going into the studio, leaving a gap of seven years between \u2019Bout Love (1978) and Watching You Watching Me (1985). After the latter failed to chart, Withers went into early retirement. The 2009 documentary, Still Bill, explored his reasons for quitting the music industry and painted the picture of a fulfilled musician and human being. Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, film critic Roger Ebert said: \u201c[Withers] still lives and survives as a happy man. Still Bill is about a man who topped the charts, walked away from it all in 1985 and is pleased that he did.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
