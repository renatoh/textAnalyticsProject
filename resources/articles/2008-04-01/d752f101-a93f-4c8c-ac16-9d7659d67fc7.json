Their reaction followed a report from the House of Lords economic affairs committee which said that record levels of immigration had had \"little or no\" positive economic impact on the living standards of the existing population. The peers therefore want to see a limit introduced. Here the Guardian assesses the arguments. The government says migration contributed about \u00a36bn to the growth of the economy in 2006. So why did the committee, chaired by the former Tory minister Lord Wakeham, dismiss it? Lord Wakeham said it was \"preposterous and irrelevant\" to use the impact on overall gross domestic product [GDP] as the key measure, because it does not reflect the economic wellbeing of the existing population. The committee says that, in the short term, immigration creates winners and losers and the biggest winners have been immigrants and their British employers. However, it concedes that customers have benefited through lower prices, and taxpayers from the lower cost of public services, but makes no attempt to quantify these amounts in its analysis. The losers, it says, have been those in low-paid jobs directly competing with new migrant workers, who include a significant share of migrants already working in the UK. But nobody has so far been able to estimate exactly how large or small this group is beyond anecdotal evidence in individual areas, such as the building trade in Southampton. On this basis, the peers say the economic impact of immigration should be judged only by its impact on the income per head of the resident population - known technically as GDP per capita. The peers said the impact of immigration on everybody's living standards had been \"largely neutral\". Is that true? In late evidence to the committee, the government submitted a joint Home Office and Department of Work and Pensions calculation that, over the past 10 years, immigration has led to an increase of 1.5% to 2% in the average citizen's income. This works out at \u00a3300 a head or \u00a330 a year. This calculation is based on a study by the Low Pay Commission, but the peers yesterday dismissed it saying that it was \"only one study\". The government says that, as migrant workers on average contribute more to the economy, because they earn more and so pay more taxes and national insurance, they will boost the average living standards of all Britons. But government economists point out that even an extra 200,000 migrants in a year constitutes only a small proportionate increase in the overall UK working population, so the direct impact on average incomes will always inevitably be small. Do we need continuing high levels of immigration to prevent labour shortages? The peers say that in the long run immigration simply increases the size of the economy without affecting the number of vacancies. The government, however, says that, despite record immigration, the number of vacancies has risen to 680,000, showing that new migrants have not driven up unemployment and are needed to fill skill shortages. So will this level continue? The projections say that net migration - the number coming minus the number leaving each year - will continue at 190,000 a year, as it has done over the past five years. But this is simply projecting into the future what has happened in the past. Migrant numbers rose to record levels because nine east European countries joined the EU in 2004 and Britain, Ireland and Sweden gave them the right to work, on the basis that it was better they came legally. All the signs are that the number coming to Britain from Poland is tailing off as other countries, such as France and Germany, open up their labour markets. The flow of new workers from Romania and Bulgaria has been small. The real question on the level of migration to Britain is whether any new countries will join the EU and get the unrestricted right to work in the UK. Talks are going on with Turkey and Georgia. Employers worry the inflow of migrants has peaked and say labour shortages are continuing, particularly in agriculture, care homes and civil engineering projects. Several labour experts predicted numbers would continue to fall even without an economic downturn, raising concerns Britain may lose out in the competition for the next movement of migrants across Europe. What about the cap or limit on numbers proposed by the peers and backed by the Conservative party? The peers acknowledge that immigration from within the EU cannot be controlled and that Britain must continue to honour its duty to asylum seekers. That leaves a limit on non-EU migration only. Low-skilled migration from outside Europe is already banned. About 60,000 a year come to the UK on family reunion grounds, mostly from India and Pakistan. This cannot be curbed without causing a major race row. No government, including a Conservative one, would want to reduce the number of skilled workers or students coming to Britain, as both are net earners for the country. That means a cap would apply only to skilled or semi-skilled workers coming from outside Europe on work permits, a point acknowledged by the peers in the report. These are known as \"tier two\" workers in the government's new points system. As the table shows, this means a cap will be quite a limited instrument, covering no more than 13% to 20% of new migrants in any one year. The committee says the time is right for the government to set an \"explicit and indicative\" target range or limit for this group, but does not specify one. The government says it is going to limit the number of tier-two workers through the new points-based system later this year, which it says is more flexible than a specific limit. In practice, the government's policy and the Tories' alternative immigration cap are not that far apart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
