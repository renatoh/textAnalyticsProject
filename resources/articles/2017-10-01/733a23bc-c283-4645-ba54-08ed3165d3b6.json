The marathon debate in the lower house began on Tuesday, and has run past midnight each day. But the government is determined to pass the bill before the end of the week, prompting the continuation into Friday, a non-sitting day. Some MPs expressed their frustration at filibustering tactics. The Greens MP Ellen Sandell described it on Twitter as \u201cappalling behaviour\u201d. Filibustering is a tactic used to block or delay a bill by deliberately extending the debate, often by bringing up minor procedural points or making long speeches. The parliament is going through all 141 clauses of the bill, but by 8.30am on Friday it was only up to clause 13, with each one attracting lengthy discussions about possible amendments. The bill is government-sponsored but not all Labor MPs support it. The deputy premier, James Merlino, pushed an amendment on Tuesday that would derailed the bill. The amendment failed to pass but it raised tensions in parliament, with the health minister, Jill Hennessy, mistakenly sending an abusive text message to Merlino. Hennessy and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said they would not consider or vote in favour of any amendments, though MPs have a conscience vote on the bill and any proposed amendments. The Liberal MP Ryan Smith put forward an amendment proposing that every mention of \u201cvoluntary assisted dying substance\u201d in the bill be replaced with the word \u201cpoison\u201d. None of the proposed amendments has passed. Hennessy, who has carriage of the bill, said on Friday as she was asked to explain the difference between pain and suffering: \u201cIt is 8.10am and have hit the crossroads of existentialism in the course of this debate.\u201d If the bill succeeds, it will be a watershed moment for supporters of assisted dying, the first time a law has passed since the Northern Territory\u2019s short-lived Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was overturned in federal parliament two decades ago. Supporters believe the legislation will ultimately pass the lower house, and that they also have the numbers in the upper house. The former Australian Medical Association president Prof Brian Owler chaired a ministerial taskforce which examined available evidence about the impact of the laws in other countries. This involved meeting with stakeholders in Australia and other countries, including palliative care experts, doctors, lawyers, nurses and disability advocates. Owler, who works as a neurosurgeon in Sydney, flew into Melbourne at 9pm on Thursday in the hope of seeing the legislation pass before his return flight to Sydney at 6am. The television presenter Andrew Denton, a high-profile voluntary assisted dying advocate, was also in the public gallery watching the debate. The Liberal MP Robert Clark has been among the most vocal opponents of the legislation, pressing Hennessy on how the 68 safeguards enshrined in the proposed law would protect against vulnerable people being coerced into voluntary assisted dying. He has also pressed the minister on the safety of the lethal medication, and concerns that once passed the laws will eventually be loosened. Clark has described the bill, which has been almost three years in the making, as \u201crushed\u201d. Many MPs also criticised Hennessy and Andrews for refusing to consider amendments. About 2.30am, parliament began debating whether to adjourn and resume later on Friday morning but the motion was defeated. The debate continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
