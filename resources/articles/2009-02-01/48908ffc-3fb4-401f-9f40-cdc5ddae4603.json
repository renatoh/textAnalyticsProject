The latest version of the free, downloadable browser supports the usual text, video and audio but also lets users download media files, update their social networking profiles and supports Silverlight, Ajax and Flash 10. Skyfire employs 40 staff, has already raised $17.8m in venture funding from Lightspeed, Matrix and Trinity and is based in Mountain View, California. \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"With Skyfire, your Mum can do everything she may already do online with her computer on her mobile phone. She can even shop for tea using Ocado.com, or check on the weather. Skyfire is a free downloadable mobile browser, so on her phone she can watch videos, listen to music, stay connected with friends on social networks, and browse whatever she wants. All the things she does browsing on her PC, she can now do from her mobile phone.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"During our beta phase, we've been focused on getting user traction but as we gear up for 1.0 in early 2009, we will announce details specific to our business model. This year, you can also expect to see a range of partnerships with carriers, device manufacturers and web 2.0 companies. The browsing business has proven business models we intend to garner as well as innovate.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Before co-founding Skyfire, I was a senior management member responsible for the advanced development group at Extreme Networks, responsible for the design, product lifecycle and general management of all power supply systems. I earned my BE degree in industrial electronics from Bharati Vidyapeeth University in Pune, Maharashtra, India, and my MS degree in electrical engineering from CalTech in Pasadena, California.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We have not published the exact numbers of our installed base, but during this beta period we did extend the product to two platforms and three countries.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"Opera Mini is our closest competitor in the sense that it is also a free downloadable browser.\" \u2022 How will you survive the financial downturn? \"In bad economic times, products and services that save time and money tend to perform very well. People can search for stuff, compare prices, pay bills, re-schedule flights, and entertain themselves on the go. And they can install Skyfire for free, on the phone they own. \"For website owners, we save them a lot of investment that they would have otherwise made to create a good mobile web experience. With Skyfire, there really is no custom development needed.\" \"We'll continue to drive consumer adoption with a combination of direct to consumer outreach and build new partnerships. We'll focus resources towards innovation to bring value to consumers to assure traction and customer retention. We have some great monetisation strategies that we will start rolling out in the near term as well. Finally, we have great investors who are very supportive.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Wireless space is very fragmented with many different platforms, networks, and business models. Navigating that is definitely the biggest challenge for us. We like to internally say that we do all that hard work so others don't have to. The idea is that if the web browsers become fully capable and fast, then developers can use standard web techniques to build applications. In other words, browsers can help fight the fragmentation in this space.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Of course - Apple and Google. Facebook and Twitter are on the verge of something very disruptive in the marketplace and could change mass-market behaviour.\" \u2022 Who's your mentor? \"I have had a few in my professional career, but most influential has been my dad. He is an entrepreneur in India and has survived and thrived for 30 years in good as well as very difficult business climates. I learn a great deal from him about passion and perseverance.\" \u2022 How's you work/life balance? \"It's hard. I'm lucky that my wife is very supportive and my kids are too young to overtly complain. I try and get up early so that I can spend a few quality hours with the family every evening. My wife is a fan of the product and uses it almost daily, and that helps since she sees what all the long hours are going towards.\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Most important software has to be the browser. I truly believe that the world would stop functioning without the web for a day. As for a web tool, that has to be our internal company wiki that we use to communicate and to listen to our customer feedback, plan our releases and add new features.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"We didn't set out to just make a mobile browser, but rather a radically new browsing experience. In five years, I would expect our innovative browsing experience to extend beyond browsing the web and include tighter integration to all functions of the phone from voice, text and browsing.\" skyfire.com So what do you think? \u2022 Is there really much demand for better mobile browsers? \u2022 How important is it for mainstream adoption that a browser like this would be installed on handsets as standard? \u2022 What single feature would really encourage take up of a new browser? Is social network integration enough?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
