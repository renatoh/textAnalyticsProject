Undaunted, she vowed to give her son the chances in life she had never had. But even she would not have predicted that he would grow up to be one of the country's most powerful money men, and almost certainly one of the richest, with a personal fortune estimated at \u00a3200m. Nor would she have guessed that with his unimaginable success would come public vilification. The little boy born in such unpromising circumstances grew up to be Damon Buffini, managing partner of the private equity firm Permira, which owns such businesses as the AA, Homebase and Birds Eye. This week he will reluctantly take centre stage when he appears in front of the Treasury select committee to defend his industry against accusations that it strips businesses bare and lays waste thousands of jobs while its wealthiest practitioners are subsidised by the British taxpayer. To his peers, Buffini is an alchemist who turns dross to gold. To his critics, he is a prince of darkness, who preys on vulnerable businesses and enriches himself at the expense of their employees. A softly spoken man with traces of an East Midlands accent, he stormed the white public school barricades of the City armed only with the sheer force of his talent. A Christian, albeit one who plays down suggestions that he is particularly devout, he spends his spare time with underprivileged children in poor parts of London such as Newham, and frets about the underachievement of young, often fatherless, black boys. That has not shielded him from the ire of the GMB union, however, which ambushed him and his family outside the Holy Trinity Church in Clapham, south London, parading a camel, suggesting it would get through the eye of a needle sooner than Buffini would get to heaven. Protesters also confronted him outside an industry charity dinner at the Roundhouse in Camden Town, a debacle that came to be known as the Asset Strippers' Ball after it emerged the entertainment had included a pole dancer. But those contretemps will be as nothing compared with what he can expect from some of the MPs on the committee. They will also sink their teeth into the other executives appearing before them, including Dominic Murphy, the personable 40-year-old partner in private equity firm KKR, who is spearheading its bid for Boots, and Philip Yea, who runs 3i, the grand-daddy of the industry. And the committee will relish crossing swords with the men representing the Wall Street giants in London: Robert Easton of Carlyle Group and David Blitzer of Blackstone. But Buffini is the one they really want. Nervousness is not normally part of his repertoire. But Buffini, who maintains his physique at London's most exclusive fitness club in the basement of the One Aldwych hotel, will have more need than usual to expel his tensions on the treadmill over the next few days. His deal-making prowess has made him the equivalent of royalty in private equity circles and, as such, he is used to being treated with deference. That will be in scant supply from the committee, which has already tasted blood. It scored a direct hit by forcing the resignation of Peter Linthwaite, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA), who crumbled under a gruelling hour of questioning. A charming, low-key figure, Linthwaite was simply too slender a reed to survive the onslaught from the committee. His fate was sealed by his ineffectual and ill-prepared efforts. The inquisition of the industry - the first to be conducted in public - took place in the Boothroyd Room in Portcullis House. Senior PR executives, campaigners, union leaders and the press all jostled for a view as Linthwaite and his fellow officials Wol Kolade and Jeremy Hand were tormented without mercy. 'There was a lot of laughing and giggling among those of us watching, and then came the slow realisation that this was turning into a car crash,' said one member of the audience. 'It was deeply, deeply uncomfortable.' Andy Love, a Labour member of the committee, said: 'They appeared before us as if they had not understood the seriousness of the debate raging around them during the past few months. I was surprised at their lack of political nous.' During the ill-tempered hearing, MPs on the committee said written evidence submitted by the BVCA was 'bland' and that answers given by Linthwaite were 'obstructive'. Linthwaite's performance was viewed as 'faltering', according to one observer: 'He seemed out of his depth and ill-prepared for some of the questions. This wasn't a man defending the industry with the gusto that was clearly required.' Linthwaite's inability to acknowledge that he had a case to answer infuriated Labour MP Anna Eagle, who tore into the BVCA for failing to realise that 'Parliament has legitimate concerns. A fifth of people working in the private sector now work for firms that are private-equity owned.' Buffini knows full well that the committee's destruction of Linthwaite was merely a warm-up act: he is the main event. He has beefed up his PR, sidelining his usual corporate advisers at City firm Bell Pottinger and drafting in one of its heaviest hitters, Peter Bingle, a leading public affairs specialist at the firm and a well-known figure in Westminster. Bingle is used to difficult briefs: he also provides strategic advice to BAE Systems, which is embroiled in allegations that it ran slush funds to secure Saudi arms deals. In a series of rehearsals, Bingle ordered Buffini to put his money-making on hold and to submit to a mock panel, firing off hostile questions and picking apart his answers to toughen him for the ordeal. To be hauled in front of the committee like a naughty schoolboy will be a novel experience for Buffini. An intensely private man, he hates being in the spotlight and is not accustomed to being summoned - gaining an audience with him normally takes months of delicate negotiation. His supporters, however, say he will not be cowed. 'There was a bloodbath last week, but Damon will not wear the browbeating that was dished out to Peter Linthwaite. The committee will not get very far with those tactics. Ignorance has been allowed to hold sway, but he has an opportunity to put a very positive side of the private equity story,' said one. This weekend, in his new home in Weybridge, Surrey, Buffini knows he will need all his acumen to get him through this week. He and his peers have strutted like peacocks across the City stage - but there are many who would like to see them take a fall. 'Buffini is a shrewd operator who is dedicated to making money,' says Paul Maloney, general secretary of the GMB. 'He appoints henchmen who have little or no regard for human beings or their well being, in order to put more pounds in his bank account. He is ignoring his own humble origins - he ought to go back and speak to some of the people who have been hurt by private equity.' The committee, led by Gordon Brown's ally, the Dunbartonshire West MP John McFall, who has previously terrorised the chiefs of the high street banks, has swung into action after the trade unions became incensed by what they depict as the 'locust-like' activities of private equity, stripping bare the companies that fall into their path. MPs will home in on a number of perceived abuses, including the generous tax benefits enjoyed by multi-millionaire private equity executives, which Observer Business has been highlighting for several months. They will also be quizzing Buffini and his peers on their maintenance of company pension funds, after unions accused them of reneging on obligations to the retired. In his 10 years as Chancellor, Gordon Brown has shown marked benevolence towards private equity. One lightning rod for anger has been 'taper relief' - a tax perk brought in by Brown that allows partners in private equity firms to pay at a rate of 10 per cent or less on gains they make on their investments, provided they are held for at least two years. This has infuriated the select committee, which wants to know why rich businessmen should pay a lower rate than a cleaner - or indeed an MP. Brown showed little sign of wanting to tackle this until the unions made an issue of it in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership race. He has been torn between the need to appease the unions and his equally pressing desire not to fall out with his rich City backers, including Sir Ronald Cohen, the founder of Apax Partners and the architect of the private equity industry in the UK. Brown has now suggested he will move to what will be described as a fairer arrangement and is expected to produce proposals in the Pre-Budget Report later this year, probably increasing the rate to 20 per cent. But that is not the only vexing tax issue. The committee will also focus on the high proportion of private equity partners who minimise tax by keeping their business affairs offshore. As we report today in Observer Business, only about 40 of the industry's top 200 partners are thought to be domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. That is a ticklish issue for Sir Ronald, who, significantly, is not appearing before the committee. Although he spoke out last week against taper relief, he refuses to disclose whether he is a non-domicile. Tax justice campaigner Richard Murphy said: 'Private equity is playing the offshore trick for all it is worth. They're claiming not to be here when they are here. This is a con trick exploiting UK taxation law.' Why has the issue blown up now? Until relatively recently, private equity was a cottage industry, whose raison d'etre was supplying capital to entrepreneurs who needed more money than the local bank manager wanted to provide. That role was uncontroversial; in fact, it is widely viewed as positive. But union unease has mounted as private equity has sought bigger targets. These include the AA - owned by Buffini's Permira - and Boots, which is in the throes of a takeover by KKR and the company's Italian deputy chairman, Stefano Pessina, and his girlfriend, Ornella Barra. Blackstone and KKR also targeted Sainsbury. The bid was unsuccessful, foundering earlier this year when it ran into the opposition of the Sainsbury family. KKR was at the forefront of the last big private equity boom, which reached its high watermark in the Gordon Gekko era of late Eighties America with its attempted takeover of RJR Nabisco a story told in the best-selling book Barbarians at the Gate. It earned KKR huge fees, but came to epitomise discontent over high-powered business figures borrowing huge sums to take over companies, then slashing jobs and embarking on asset sales to pay off the debt. Critics believe that the current private equity boom, which has been fuelled by low borrowing costs as interest rates fell under Labour, is a return to those bad old days. Many publicly owned firms, some with flat-footed management, were also ripe for takeover. Opponents argue that private equity organisations, which are under no obligation to supply information to the financial press, customers or indeed anyone apart from their investors, is now too big to be allowed to operate with so little scrutiny. Much of the publicity the industry has attracted has been negative. At the AA, 3,400 staff have lost their jobs since Permira took over. At Birds Eye, there has been anger over plans to close a factory in Hull with the loss of 500 jobs. Private equity claims it has created thousands of new jobs, though it is quieter on whether these are lower paid and of lower quality than the ones lost. But it is not just the traditional left that has misgivings. Small shareholders are upset that private equity bids and foreign takeovers are denuding the FTSE 100 of the big domestic companies in which they like to invest, to be replaced by riskier enterprises such as Kazakh oil companies or online gaming. Big City investors are also irate over deals that have made them look like fools. As one leading fund manager, John Duffield, says, a successful private equity deal depends mainly on finding 'a moronic seller' who will hand over the assets too cheaply. That is what many believe happened at Debenhams. It was sold off to private equity, its property portfolio was put under the hammer and the new owners extracted fat dividends. Barely two years later, the company was re-introduced to the stock market, loaded with debt. Investors bought it back at a higher price than they sold for, only to see their shares sink. Exponents of private equity believe they can deliver superior performance to bureaucratic public companies, which are often bogged down in management hierarchy. Public companies also have to expend huge amounts of time producing detailed disclosures of their sales and profits to the stock market, a chore that does not trouble private equity. The industry also argues the interests of owners and managers are much more closely aligned in its model than in a public company, which is typically owned by a disparate crew of investors, who often fail to exercise vigilance when things go wrong, and may impose contradictory demands on managements. Most people in corporate Britain would acknowledge that not all private equity operators are robber barons. Many would argue that the sector has invigorated industry as a whole, if only by frightening managements into improving their performance. It may be that the glory days of private equity are coming to an end without the intervention of unions or MPs. Some insiders, including Alchemy's Jon Moulton, best known for his failed bid for MG Rover, believe the sector has created a bubble that could burst painfully. The rising cost of borrowing, as the Bank of England has progressively increased interest rates, is undermining the financial logic of deals, and policy-makers are worried that some banks have indulged in excessively risky lending to private equity players. The industry itself accepts the need for reform and has appointed City grandee Sir David Walker to draft a code of conduct. But if the mood of the committee last week is a guide, it has a long way to go to convince outsiders that it is a force for economic good. Damon Buffini and his colleagues have enriched themselves - their challenge is to convince MPs and the rest of us that they are enriching the nation as a whole. How it works Private equity firms such as Permira and KKR raise large sums of money from pension funds and other large investors and then use the cash to buy companies. Their claim is that they can work a company's assets harder and earn more profit, which they aim to realise either by selling the business on or by floating it on the stock market. When it works, the returns can be mouthwatering; Permira claims its European funds, for instance, made 33 per cent profit last year. Once it has bought a business, a private equity firm will take a close interest in operations, often taking a seat on the board. Private equity owners will provide advice on finance, strategy and business development, which can be valuable for smaller firms. Over the past few years, however, they have become more ambitious, launching multibillion-pound bids for FTSE 100 companies including J Sainsbury and Alliance Boots. One in five people in the private sector workforce is now employed by a private-equity-owned firm. Private equity buyers typically borrow large sums to finance larger deals. The industry argues that the debt acts as a discipline, encouraging high levels of performance, but critics say it has left corporate Britain too deep in the red, putting jobs and pensions at risk. Unlike companies quoted on the stock market, businesses owned by private equity are not obliged to supply regular updates on their financial performance. The downside is that large organisations, such as the AA, with millions of staff and customers, can slip off the public's radar, as little information is published about them.
