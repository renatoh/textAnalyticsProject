The pod - and in particular, AC Jimbo and Paolo Bandini - is hovering somewhere around cloud nine for tonight's Euro 2012 Football Daily. Scott Murray and Paul Doyle give a slightly more objective analysis of a fantastic game that saw Italy silence the Germans and book their place in the final against Spain. Filippo Maria Ricci tells us what it was like in Kiev. And that, friends, means there's just one more pod to go. Join us on Sunday night when we'll see if the reign of Spain continues in Ukraine or Italy can claim their second title whilst the domestic game is investigated for dodgy dealings.
