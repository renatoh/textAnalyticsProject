Sally Wainwright said the atmosphere on Coronation Street, which she used to write for, was \u201coverwhelmingly male\u201d and that the industry remains tough. Wainwright\u2019s comments came after a list of the BBC\u2019s highest paid on-air stars revealed just a third of its top earners are women and that the top seven are all men. The BBC\u2019s list of stars earning more than \u00a3150,000 last year did not include high-profile female presenters such as Emily Maitlis, Sarah Montague and Louise Minchin despite their male co-presenters all featuring. John Humphrys, who presents the Today programme on Radio 4 alongside Montague as well as Mastermind on BBC1, was paid more than \u00a3600,000 last year. More than 40 of the BBC\u2019s most high-profile female stars wrote to Tony Hall, the director general, calling on him to urgently correct the gender pay gap. In response Hall wrote that closing the pay gap had been \u201ca personal priority over the last four years\u201d and pledged that both employees and the public would see a marked difference once the salaries were published again next year. Wainwright suggested to the Radio Times magazine that an upcoming profile of her on The South Bank Show, the arts programme, had taken longer to be broadcast because she was a woman. \u201cThe South Bank Show did [male writers] Paul Abbott and Russell T Davies years ago, but I\u2019ve been overlooked,\u201d she said in the interview with the magazine. Happy Valley, which starred Sarah Lancashire as a Yorkshire-based policewoman, was one of the most-acclaimed UK programmes broadcast last year. Wainwright also wrote Last Tango in Halifax and At Home with the Braithwaites after working on Coronation Street, the ITV soap. Wainwright said she was one of three female writers on Coronation Street out of a team of 15. \u201cThe whole atmosphere was overwhelmingly male and even now it\u2019s tough,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many fewer women writers and directors. A lot of it is to do with women\u2019s confidence. Women don\u2019t put themselves forward as writers. \u201cMen are trusted more, it\u2019s just assumed they\u2019ll be good at something. Whereas women have to prove they\u2019re going to be good at it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
