More than 45,000 professional footballers worldwide, members of the players' union FIFPro, were invited to vote in the annual awards, which are in their third year. Kaka was at the heart of his club's run to a seventh European Cup win last May, scoring 10 goals - including three in the semi-final against Manchester United - on the way to the final victory against Liverpool in Athens. Barcelona's Ronaldinho, Kaka's Brazil international team-mate, had won the previous two awards. Lyon's captain, Juninho, will escape punishment by Uefa for his blatant dive during Tuesday's Champions League game against Rangers because it did not materially affect the result, with Walter Smith's side winning 3-0. Rangers were leading 1-0 at the end of the first half when the Brazilian midfielder dived as David Weir challenged him just outside the box. The Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo then booked Weir and Juninho came within inches of equalising as his free-kick hit the underside of the bar. Weir cannot appeal against his caution. A Uefa spokesman said: \"There will be no case according to a preliminary analysis by a disciplinary inspector. The player's action did not deteriorate the regularity of the match as it resulted in a yellow card, which cannot be protested against, as well as a free-kick. Only serious acts of deceiving the referee are prosecuted such as diving resulting in a penalty.\" Coventry City's managing director, Paul Fletcher, has resigned. The Championship club, which is currently involved in takeover talks with potential investors, said in a statement: \"The club would like to thank Paul for his dedication and hard work during what has undoubtedly been a difficult time. Coventry City will be making no further statement at this time.\" Blackpool have been given international clearance to sign the Canadian winger Michael D'Agostino. The 20-year-old had been playing for the Championship club's reserve side while awaiting the green light to make his first-team debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
