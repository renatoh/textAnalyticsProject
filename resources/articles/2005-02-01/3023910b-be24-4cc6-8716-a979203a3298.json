I want to see as much as possible, but I'd also like to do some voluntary work. Is three weeks long enough for that? My budget is tight so I don't want to pay the usual fees for taking part in conservation work abroad. Who should I contact? I'm physically fit and open to any sort of work. Jenny Hacker, Manchester Even if you don't go with a recognised voluntary organisation, there's generally a fee to pay. Normally this covers your board and lodging and any transport costs. If you're unwilling to pay these contributions, forget about turtle tagging, stroking stressed koalas or anything that might seem glamorous. If you're happy to travel outside Sydney, try contacting a body called WWOOF, or Willing Workers on Organic Farms (wwoof.org). In exchange for your time you'll be fed and given somewhere to sleep. You'll often be working on commercial organic farms, whether full- or part-time. The other workplaces involved are alternative co-operatives or communities. As you're only in Sydney for a short time, you may be able to organise something through Volunteering NSW (volunteering.com.au), which organises placements throughout New South Wales. It's worth getting in touch with them in advance, as it can take time to arrange things. If you have specific skills, even with computers or people, tell them. This will increase your chances of sorting something out. Some friends and I will spend a week in northern Spain in March. We arrive in Valencia for the end of the Fallas festival, and then travel to Zaragoza for two nights and on to Bilbao for our flight home. What is the best way to travel by public transport between the cities? Dave Roll, Newcastle Zaragoza is an attractive city well worth a day and two nights. It has Roman remains, an unusual basilica and the fine Moorish era Aljaferia Palace. By night, the lanes of the old town are home to tapas and drinking dens. An hour away is the atmospheric town of Calatayud. Spend a half day exploring its alleys and churches. The rest of your time should be spent in Bilbao, exploring the great art of the Museo de Bellas Artes and the awe-inspiring Guggenheim. Finish your trip with a view of Bilbao from the funicular train. Take a train from Valencia to Zaragoza and then on to Bilbao. Fast inter-city Talgo services run on both routes. From Valencia it's five and a half hours to Zaragoza and then four on to Bilbao. Expect to pay about \u00a320 for each leg of the journey. Times and bookings are available online through Renfe (www.renfe.es). I'm planning to take my 10-year-old daughter to the US for four or five weeks this summer. We want to travel fairly independently and cheaply, taking in Montana, New York, Florida and maybe one or two other places. Is it possible to buy cheap internal flights when booking our international tickets, or should we go by train or bus? Are there YWCA or religious hostels (we're Quakers)? Becca Clare, North Yorkshire While it's worth taking one train for the experience (possibly from New York to Florida - see amtrak.com for schedules and fares), it is best to get around mostly by flying. Your daughter might not like long bus journeys, though short hops would be fine. Go to greyhound.com. There are plenty of no-frills airlines, but unless you're skilful in planning it's unlikely they will be significantly cheaper than arranging stopovers or add-ons to your international ticket. A specialist firm near you is North America Travel Service (0113 243 1606; northamericatravelservice.co.uk). If you do leave arranging internal transport until you arrive, it is worth contacting a travel agent then to check for last-minute deals. If you'd rather do price comparisons in advance, try johnnyjet.com. The US has independent hostels as well as ones linked to Hostelling International (hiayh.org). Alternatives are hostels.com, for hotel prices and bookings, and seeamerica.org, a one-stop site for US tourist information. We face an eight-hour wait between flights at Moscow airport and want to visit the city. But we are deterred by stories about the difficulty of obtaining Russian visas, the time it takes to exit customs and our need to be back well before our next flight leaves. Can you be more positive? Ken Holroyd, Shipley Not really, but even if you only have time for a quick photocall and a toast to Lenin in Red Square it beats sitting at the airport with nothing to do. To leave the airport you'll require a transit visa. To get one, contact the Russian Embassy (020 7229 8027; rusemblon.org). Over to you ... feedback from our readers I have some tips on what to wear at night when travelling on Indian trains (Ask the Experts, 15 January). Seven members of my family spent several nights in first-class, air-conditioned carriages mainly in the north of India three years ago. Women on sleeper trains need to be discreet. We did not see any Indian women in obvious nightwear. We had a problem as the clothing that our female teenager took was much too revealing! Most carriages were communal, although compartments and beds could be separated by curtains. It was necessary to change in and out of day clothes in your bed, so your clothing had to be very loose. My husband and I shared a sleeping compartment with two smart Indian men who wore well pressed, spotless kaftans in bed. My stretchy cotton yoga trousers were perfect.
