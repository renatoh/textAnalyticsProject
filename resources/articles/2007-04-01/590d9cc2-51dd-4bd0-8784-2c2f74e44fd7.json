Literature (if you can call it that) on America's weirdest and most talked-about superstar abounds, and increasingly so in the form of biography. Darwin Porter's Jacko: His Rise and Fall, which looks at Jackson 'from the inside out', claims to be the most comprehensive of the lot. Porter 'takes the face off' the Michael Jackson we think we know. Michael (Darwin and he are on first-name terms) is a normal kid, living in abnormal times, Porter says. He may be the subject of corporal punishment by his father and allegations of knife threats from his brother Jermaine, and of accusations of homosexuality, bisexuality and even asexuality by the media. But in Porter's account, he 'always got up to go to the Sunday meeting of the Jehovah's Witnesses', experienced 'history's worst case of acne' and refused Andy Warhol's request to film his face while being penetrated anally with the words: 'No thanks. It's long past my bedtime.' This is the story of the good boy turned rotten, or 'Peter Pan grows up'. JM Barrie wouldn't be impressed. 'Literature' it certainly isn't, but this biography is dangerously addictive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
