The Spanish manager admits he is bitterly disappointed with the loss of Liverpool's Champions League crown but points out he has strong plans for the club. \"Rick Parry [chief executive] and the board are working on solutions for the future, and I have confidence in them. I do not know if we have more or less money - but we are working on new ideas, working with the players we have and thinking about who we have out on loan,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"Then we will consider the transfer market and making use of what we already have here. This does not affect my own plans. \"The club are working to improve, they have been working for a couple of years trying to find some more money, I know they are looking and trying to find solutions. If they cannot I will try to do my best, for sure. It is difficult to say if you lose the Champions League whether things will be more difficult. As a manager you must work with the players that you have. We will try to improve the squad and the players with the money we have at this moment. If we had more money, yes it would be better.\" The build-up to Liverpool's shattering defeat by Benfica was dogged by speculation about Ben\u00edtez's future and his clear agenda for the board to find funds to spend in the transfer market. But the day after the nightmare loss of the European Cup at Anfield, he was again insisting he is planning long term, not for a quick exit. \"I am only concerned with winning the next game and working as hard as possible for my club,\" he added. \"I do not have a problem now, I want to improve my team this season and in the future. \"If you continue winning in the Champions League you will earn more money. We do not have that any more so we need to work with the players here and try to find the best solution in terms of money. Sometimes it is not just receiving a big amount of money that solves things, it is how you use your imagination with how you spend what you have. In football everything can change after one game. Now we need to think about the future but you cannot say we are worse than one day before playing Benfica.\" Ben\u00edtez has made it clear, however, that he will mark the end of Liverpool's great European adventure by accelerating his search for new players. \"We need to work harder looking for new players because we know what the situation is and what must be done,\" he said. \"We are working now. The scouting department is working on improving the team. When you lose a game as important as this one, I prefer not to talk about new players or current players. Or what mistakes we made. I just want to change such things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
