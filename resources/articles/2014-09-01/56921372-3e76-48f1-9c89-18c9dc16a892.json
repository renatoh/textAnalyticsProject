Take a look at the 20-year chart of the FTSE 100 index and you could be forgiven for thinking investing is easy. One only had to get two things right: buy when the index was below 4,000, which was the mid 1990s, 2003 and 2009; and sell when 7,000 was within sight \u2013 1999, when the dotcom bubble was about to burst, and 2007, just before the banking bust. So here we go again? London's blue-chip index came close to the 7,000 mark this week, and it's not hard to conjure up reasons why shares might be considered too expensive. The geopolitical weather in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and Russia is terrible. The eurozone crisis rumbles along amid the new threat of deflation and with a central bank that, despite this week's display of resistance, may have left its response too late. Meanwhile, companies' profit margins are strong (albeit with important exceptions), but they may struggle to become stronger if consumers' real take-home pay doesn't improve more quickly. So, who knows? Selling the FTSE 100 at 7,000-ish might, once again, be the right card. Yet it feels all wrong. If we've learned anything in the past few years, it is never to underestimate central bankers' terror of upsetting financial markets. The US Federal Reserve is retreating from quantitative easing only via baby steps. In Japan, they're running in the other direction, and now the European Central Bank has adopted quasi-QE and may go for the real thing eventually. The era of cheap money, which inevitably washes through share prices, doesn't feel over just yet. Then there's the old-fashioned dividend calculation. Do you really want to own German 10-year bonds at a yield of 0.95%, or the French version at 1.25%, or even UK 10-year gilts at 2.5%, if you can own companies offering superior dividend income? The yield on the FTSE 100 stands at 3.5%. Dividend growth seems to be slowing, but examples of outright cutters like Tesco are rare; they are also balanced by the likes of Standard Life, which this week discovered it could sell its Canadian business for a whizzy price and return a fifth of the whole group's market capitalisation to shareholders. In terms of price-to-earnings, the FTSE 100's international collection is valued at about 13-times next year's expected earnings. Analysts' year-ahead guesses should be taken with a dose of salt, of course, since the perennial optimism discharged from corporate boardrooms can be dangerously infectious. Yet, if you believe 13 times, it makes the UK market seem neither cheap nor outrageously expensive either in historical terms. The guess here is that the FTSE 100 can continue to wander close to the 7,000 mark, and threaten to breach it, for some time yet. Yes vote would hit sterling, gilts and share prices The big get-out clause to the above is the Scottish referendum. Those UK economists issuing scary-sounding warnings this week are almost certainly right: the first impact of a surprise yes vote on 18 September would be a hit to sterling, gilts and share prices. Scots shouldn't worry on that score because the financial pros and cons of independence can only be weighed on long-term scales. Even Kevin Daly, Goldman Sachs's chief UK economist who warned of \"severely negative\" short and medium-term economic consequences for Scotland and the rest of the UK in the event of a yes vote, made the point that \"in the long run, we see little reason why an independent Scotland could not prosper\". But there's an interesting question about how the Bank of England and the big Scottish banks would react on 19 September if the result is \"yes\". Governor Mark Carney said a fortnight ago that there are contingency plans in place, but understandably declined to discuss them. Step one, though, seems obvious: loud assurances to depositors that there is no reason whatsoever to withdraw money from Scottish banks, coupled with a reminder that Threadneedle Street remains responsible for financial stability across the whole of the UK right up until the moment of separation, which would be 2016 at the earliest. As for Scottish banks themselves, their first response to a yes vote is equally clear. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds would have to declare that they will move their registered offices from Edinburgh to London as soon as they can get approval from the courts. The assets of the big two banks are 12 times as large as Scottish GDP, so there is no chance of an independent Scotland being able to act as a lender of last resort in a crisis. If there is doubt on the point, markets will jump on it and the banks' funding costs would soar. Whether a move of a registered office is merely a shift of a brass-plate, or would herald an on-the-ground exodus from Edinburgh's financial centre, is a debate in itself. Either way though, RBS, Lloyds and TSB would have to say within hours of a yes vote that, legally, they can't be Scottish. Dave Lewis's tame start at Tesco Dave Lewis, Tesco's new boss, doesn't like the nickname Drastic Dave, a hangover from his Unilever days, but he does enjoy his new employer's own-brand chilli fishcakes. Oh, and there will be a few management changes \u2013 but, given how far Tesco has fallen, it would be a surprise if there were not. Those were the highlights of Lewis's tame video interview with a colleague, shared on YouTube. There will be \"no hasty decisions\" and \"no knee jerk reactions\" because Lewis is in listening mode. A week into the job, most chief executives would be equally bland and noncommittal. All the same, investors will soon want something more strategically enlightening than this: \"It's about an enhanced customer experience and then making it economically viable in a way shareholders can appreciate.\" That's a motherhood and apple pie statement. Come on, the question is whether shareholders will have to surrender a big chunk of profits, which they won't appreciate, in order to enhance customers' lot via lower prices. At some point, a choice will have to be made \u2013 and it may have to be drastic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
