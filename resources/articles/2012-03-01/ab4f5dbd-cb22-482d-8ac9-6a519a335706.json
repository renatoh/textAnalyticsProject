I remember standing in a queue of shivering boys, all in white Y-fronts having just taken their weekly bath, waiting for an old matron aptly named Mrs Holyland. When it was your turn she would rub your hair dry, singing: \"I know where I'm going and who is going with me, I know who I love and his name is\" \u2013 pause for effect \u2013 \"Adrian Sibley.\" With a kiss on the cheek she'd send you on your way to the dormitory. A mildly unnerving experience but nonetheless a small act of kindness in an all-male environment heavy on religion but devoid of love. Many years later, having mostly washed away the less enjoyable experiences of boarding at a young age, I find myself singing the same ditty to my four-year-old daughter Marta when I dry her hair after an evening bath. Recently she surprised me, as she often does. I sang, \"I know where I'm going\" and after \"and who is going with me\" she shouted \"No one!\" with glee. I laughed and wondered if she understood what she was saying. If she did, she has a wicked sense of humour I like to think she got from her father, although perhaps one liable to occasionally upset other children. Even if she didn't, she had reminded me that the unexpected is what I enjoy most about being her dad because I get to see things with and through Marta. I learned how to be self-sufficient in a hierarchical public-school system where older boys could put younger ones through misery, mainly because they had been through it themselves. But without the affection of parents who were miles away, my ability to trust, understand and share my feelings atrophied. Although my parents were sure they were doing the right thing, years later they have both wondered what they sacrificed. Without wanting to smother her with affection, I want to let Marta know that my love is always there when she needs it, so she can grow in a way I didn't. The joy of looking through my child's eyes and sharing her wonder is a true gift. Marta can see things I can't as we walk down a street. She points out the paper signs for lost animals on trees and advises me that I could use paper on trees as well, to sell things. She points to a jet high above, which she says is dragging the light through the sky. She even points out the dog poo and, if she feels so inclined, counts them. There's a lot of pointing that you have to do with children. (I'm leaving out my one year old son, Kai, as although he's a charmer, he's not talking yet, which is when the fun really starts.) You get a new set of eyes to look at what may have become a tired world; a new lease of life and if you really listen to your child, a whole new self. My friend Sam says this of his three-year-old daughter: \"She makes me realise how I've become used to what is around me and take for granted. Having her around makes me lose all cynicism about the world. My imagination is learning from her, but I haven't got it quite right yet. Occasionally I'll jump on an upturned box and say, 'I'm riding this horse', and she'll give a funny look and say, 'Don't be silly, Daddy, that's not a horse. It's a pig.'\" A child's imagination knows no bounds and is not limited by the rules of the real world. That's something I am not only keen to encourage in my daughter but also in myself. I always thought the world would become bigger as I got older, but more often than not it can become smaller, colder and, well, just less inspiring. I flatter myself I know about the ways of the world. However, a little person can set you right and put you back on the path of true learning, keeping your imagination open and even your dreams alive. Children's questions keep coming from left, right, above and below field. Yesterday, when we were driving through London to an unexplored playground, out of nowhere Marta asked: \"Dad, why do you like Mum wearing black?\" My wife reminded me that when she was getting ready for a pre-Christmas drinks party I had encouraged her not to wear a dress with flowers but a black dress, and our daughter was listening. Although Marta often appears to be busy doing her own thing, she's absorbing and always has an opinion. Jonathan, who is in his early 30s \u2013 I'm in my 40s \u2013 is amazed by his daughter's ability to recall grievances: \"She's far better at that than remembering the positives.\" We agreed that a father disciplining his children should tread carefully as they will be stockpiling their grievances and by the time they are adults themselves may only remember them at the expense of the good times. It's inevitable that parents struggle, even fight with their children, as they can be very annoying, but that must never obscure the unmatched pleasure of giving them a father's love. So, on those days when my patience has run out and I feel I don't have enough time to do what I want rather than what my daughter wants, I remind myself that having a second childhood through my child is more than a worthy exchange for the loss of one's former self. The unexpected is mostly great fun but it can be disturbing. During a phone chat with Marta while I was working in America, I reassured her that I would be coming home soon and she excitedly told me: \"It's OK, Daddy, if you don't come back because I will get a new daddy.\" Perhaps she was dealing with my absence by replacing me and this left me thinking the unthinkable about both a life without her and her life without me being her father. It's not uncommon for Marta to ask: \"When are you going to die, Daddy?\" And even more pertinently, \"Why do you have to die, Daddy?\" She's not afraid of her thoughts or her questions, even if we are. It's as if a child has the ability to be psychic, or at least see her fears and face them more clearly than we can as adults. Children can walk where we fear to tread and writers have long mined this dark terrain. Marta and I are only at the beginning of what I hope will be a long journey of discovery for us both. I relish the innocence of today when I can pick her up from nursery and she'll tell me she has married her best friend Joshie yet again. And although far off, I'm already apprehensive of facing the teenage years and can't help recall Billy Crystal's line: \"My daughter can have sex after I'm dead.\" Marta has made me understand that I have as much to learn from her as she from me. That said, I refuse to listen to her thoughts about television. Recently she stopped asking for Peppa Pig, which was a relief as it was driving me nuts. Now she incessantly asks for an Australian show called Bananas in Pyjamas, which makes me fondly remember the days of Peppa Pig. Perhaps resistance is futile and I should just get with the schedule and sit back to watch two bananas in pyjamas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
