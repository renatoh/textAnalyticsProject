Rowdy, catchy and halfway between Toni Basil and Girls Aloud, the single suggested that here was a band making the kind of pop perhaps thought to be exclusively made abroad by the likes of CSS. It's something that Jules De Martino and Katie White may struggle to match up to. From a background in a Salford arts commune, the pair occasionally show a bizarre leaning towards Fame Academy-style vocals - though they strive to keep things featherweight and fun. \u00b7 Komedia, Brighton, Thu 15; Concorde 2, Brighton, Fri 16"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
