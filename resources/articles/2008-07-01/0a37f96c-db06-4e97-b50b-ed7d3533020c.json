With the first-choice goalkeeper, Tim Howard, and the African players yet to return from their summer breaks and several other players out through injury, an inexperienced line-up was second-best throughout and conceded the decisive goal in the 58th minute, when Didier Cretterand beat Iain Turner after a neat one-two opened up the Everton defence. Robinho not prepared to be makeweight The Real Madrid forward Robinho has refused to be part of any deal to bring Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United to the Bernab\u00e9u, saying that he hopes not to move this summer. \"I am not prepared to enter into the operation to sign Cristiano,\" he said. \"I hope to remain at Real Madrid this year. Now I am only thinking about Madrid.\" The Brazilian is a target for Chelsea. Fine is a \"kick in the teeth,\" says Owen The prospective Luton Town chairman, Nick Owen, says the League Two club have been \"kicked in the teeth\" by the Football League with the decision that they will start the season with a 30-point penalty - 10 points levied by the FA for misconduct and another 20 by the league last week after they came out of administration. \"I'm just baffled and bewildered that they can be so harsh on us,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"You know you're going to get some sort of sanctions but it seems to go on and on. Where do you draw the line? Perhaps five points, 10 points, but 20? It's just breathtaking. How they think we can survive that I do not know.\" Luton's manager, Mick Harford, will remain at the club. Bent to have Cardiff medical Marcus Bent is expected to have a medical today before completing his move from Charlton Athletic to Cardiff and joining his new team-mates on their pre-season trip to Portugal. Chris Iwelumo, another striker, is also likely to leave Charlton soon, with Crystal Palace one possible destination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
