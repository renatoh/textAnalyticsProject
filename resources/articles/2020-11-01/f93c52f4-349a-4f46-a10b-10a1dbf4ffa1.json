The German world No 7 \u2013 who lost to the eventual champion Daniil Medevev and the world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the ATP Tour Finals in London last week \u2013 denied on an almost daily basis claims by Olya Sharypova that he had abused her during their long relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it was, but it certainly was not immediate,\u201d Murray said of the ATP\u2019s statement of 13 November, two weeks after Sharypova\u2019s claims became public in the Russian media. \u201cBut I have read some stuff, and obviously tennis doesn\u2019t have a domestic abuse policy. That is something we as a sport should be looking into, so the ATP know what to do in that situation, rather than having to think and react to it. They can be a bit more proactive in a situation like that. They need to take it extremely seriously and see what comes of it in the coming months.\u201d The ATP statement condemned \u201cany form of violence or abuse\u201d, and added: \u201cWe expect all members of the Tour to do the same, and to refrain from any conduct that is violent, abusive, or puts others at risk.\u201d A review would only follow legal investigation and \u201cdue process\u201d, the statement said. So far, Sharypova and Zverev have declined to seek legal advice. Murray, who has not played since a disappointing loss to Fernando Verdasco in Cologne last month, said in a wide-ranging interview he expected players would be willing to take coronavirus vaccines before tournaments so the Tour can \u201cget back to normality\u201d. He added: \u201cI would hope that all the players would be willing to do that for the good of the sport \u2013 providing everything has proved to be safe, [with] clinical trials done and there are not any significant side effects. From what I\u2019ve been hearing on the TV and on the news, there shouldn\u2019t really be any long-term effects.\u201d As for Djokovic\u2019s reported reluctance to vaccinate, Murray said: \u201cI read a few weeks after he\u2019d said he wouldn\u2019t be keen on doing it that, if it was something that had to be done for him to play the sport, he would.\u201d Murray, who trains and hits nearly every day at the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton, admits he has work to do to reach acceptable match fitness at 33 but he has experienced no pain from the psoas hip muscle injury which struck him down at the US Open in September. \u201cI started practising two weeks ago. I\u2019ve been doing tons of work in the gym, trying to build towards beating all of my personal bests, which has been quite exciting for me. I\u2019m really motivated. The only thing that I maybe won\u2019t get to the same level is the speed. But I\u2019m hoping that by improving my strength and my power that that will help me get a little bit faster on the court. There\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t get it back to what it was before. And that wasn\u2019t the case probably in the last year. I feel good.\u201d Murray says he has heard that the Australian Open, scheduled to start on 18 January, might be postponed for \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d, not pushed back to later in February or March, as reported there last week, because it would then bump up against American hard-court tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would work for the sport as they\u2019re two huge tournaments in March. The best-case scenario now is to put it back a couple of weeks. That would allow the players to get over there at the beginning of January and prepare properly for the event. I\u2019ll go as soon as I can.\u201d The Victorian government is yet to decide if players must be quarantined without playing in tournaments or practising for 14 days, although they could not arrive before 1 January. Murray says that is an issue to be resolved. \u201cIt would be tricky. A lot of players are coming from very cold climates. To ask them to play in 35, 36-degree heat with no match preparation just increases the risk of injuries, and possibly the quality of tennis is not going to be that high. It wouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker for me. It just makes it a little bit tougher.\u201d Meanwhile, he is looking forward to Christmas with his wife, Kim, and their children at home in Surrey. \u201cI\u2019d originally planned not being around for Christmas when we thought we were going to have to be away from 15 December. So that\u2019s one of the positives about a delay. Not getting to see your extended families is tough around that time of year but, if that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do to keep everyone safe for the time being, it\u2019s probably worth it.\u201d Murray\u2019s 2020 comeback was mixed but he thinks he can go deep in big tournaments again. \u201cIf I\u2019m fit, I will. I haven\u2019t forgotten how to play tennis. I know I will perform and win big matches if I can get properly fit and healthy for an extended period of time.\u201d A major goal in 2021 for the two-times Olympic gold medallist is going to the postponed Tokyo Games. \u201cI would love to compete in the Olympics again. That would be huge for me \u2013 in the top few priorities for the year. And I\u2019d love to play at Wimbledon again, same with the Aussie Open, and then, if I\u2019m fit and well, I\u2019d be pumped to go and try and win another medal in Tokyo.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
