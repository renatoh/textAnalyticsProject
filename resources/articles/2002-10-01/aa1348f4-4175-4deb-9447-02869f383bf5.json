The players were told of the club's plight in a lunchtime meeting yesterday and, as with Watford and Barnsley before them, the request produced a mixed reaction. \"There is a such a sliding scale of wages here that it is unlikely all players will agree to such a demand,\" said an insider. Leicester lie second in the First Division but are still paying wages at the lower end of the Premiership scale after relegation last season. Their top earner, Muzzy Izzet, is believed to be on \u00a320,000 a week, with the lowest paid players on about \u00a37,000. The club's accounts for the latest year available, ending July 2001, showed a wage bill of \u00a316.1m, or 55% of turnover. The development came on the day the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, Gordon Taylor, said his members were being bullied into taking wage cuts by cash-strapped Football League clubs after the collapse of ITV Digital. \"Players are being intimidated and harassed,\" said Taylor. \"They are being threatened with 'Well, you won't have a job if you don't take a wage cut'. Contracts have to be honoured. Otherwise it's a waste of time having agreements and we'll end up a third-world country in footballing terms.\" Leicester have struggled financially since relegation from the Premiership last season and the outlay on their new Walkers Stadium has left them \u00a330m in debt. They had hoped to alleviate the problems by selling their more valuable assets in the close season but only Matthew Piper, Robbie Savage and Lee Marshall brought in any substantial revenue, though Dennis Wise's recent sacking has helped ease the wage bill by a further \u00a330,000 a week. Piper fetched \u00a33.5m from Sunderland, Savage \u00a32.5m from Birmingham and Marshall \u00a3800,000 from West Bromwich Albion. Fifa's new transfer embargo on Premiership clubs has put a stop to any lucrative transfer activity until January and Leicester are now looking to their playing staff, in the short term at least, to ease the crisis. The dilemma will take on a new complexion when the transfer window opens again: do they offload in bulk and risk the break-up of a side that looks more than capable of returning to the top flight under Micky Adams, or do they try to cut costs in other areas? The plc chairman Greg Clarke admitted this month that he remained uncertain of the club's future existence. \"I can't give any assurance to fans that they will have a club to support,\" he said. \"We are trying to put in place a guarantee that will secure the club's future. But we can't make that promise at the moment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
