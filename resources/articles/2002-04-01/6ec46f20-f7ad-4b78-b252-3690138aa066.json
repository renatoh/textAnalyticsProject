At the end the beanpole Bayern Munich striker, the Paraguayans' chief threat tonight, skipped off the Anfield turf having hardly broken sweat. \"What a stage on which to test ourselves,\" smiled the forward, a commanding presence in a team that boasts few household names now that the extrovert goalscoring goalkeeper Luis Jose Chilavert is injured and absent. \"People may not know us over here, but playing England will be a chance to test ourselves against one of the best teams in the world. We want to make our mark.\" The visitors' squad list may be unfamiliar, but England would do well to avoid complacency this evening. Paraguay finished fourth in South America's qualification group, drawing 2-2 and 1-1 with Argentina to emerge as the only team to avoid defeat against the World Cup favourites. Cesare Maldini's party may include only five players plying their trade in Europe, but it boasts a wealth of experience in the 10 who featured at the 1998 World Cup, where Paraguay were edged out 1-0 by the host nation and eventual winners, France. \"We had a very good side in '98, but we have improved since then,\" said Santa Cruz, who made his international debut at 17 and was signed by Bayern on the back of five goals at the 1999 Copa America that helped propel Paraguay to the quarter-finals. \"We are more than capable of progressing through the first stage and into the knock-outs. Mr Maldini's personality and experience as a manager on a world-wide stage is already shining through and there's no reason why we can't do well.\" \"Experience is priceless in football,\" said the AEK Athens defender Carlos Gamarra, who should earn his 75th cap tonight. \"We've got a lot of players who played in France, but above all we possess the firepower we lacked then. We have plenty of options with players like Roque. We have strength in attack now.\" Yet their build-up to the tournament has been far from smooth. Defeats in their last two qualifying games, albeit once progress had been guaranteed, cost Sergio Markarian his job last December and prompted the Paraguayan FA to turn to Maldini. The 70-year-old will remain at the helm until after the World Cup, a chance to correct the impression left by his relatively disastrous spell in charge of Italy four years ago. His appointment caused some anguish among the domestic football managers' association, who claimed the Italian had signed his contract while in the country on a tourist visa, rendering it illegal. Maldini has stuck to the tactics that proved so successful in qualifying. Paraguay should line up in a solid 4-4-2 formation tonight, with the coach resisting the temptation to revert to the sweeper system he favoured with Italy. \"We want to test ourselves against the best sides in Europe,\" he said. \"England are one of them. Personally, I put them in the top four favourites alongside Argentina, Italy and France.\" \"Cesare has brought something different to our style,\" added Gamarra. \"We had a South American throughout the qualifying stages and the very fact that Mr Maldini is a European coach brings with it different ways of working and training methods. Hopefully, we will see the benefits at the World Cup.\" Paraguay (4-4-2; probable): Tavarelli (Olimpia); Arce (Palmeiras, Br), Ayala (River Plate, Arg), Gamarra (AEK Athens), Caniza (Santos Laguna, Mex); Struway (Libertad), Gavilan (Newcastle Utd), Paredes (Porto), Bonet (Libertad); Santa Cruz (Bayern Munich), Cardozo (Toluca, Mex). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
