In the extraordinary statement issued on Tuesday \u2013 which begins with the words \u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d \u2013 Trump quotes Saudi officials as describing Khashoggi as an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d. The 649-word statement appears to be a presidential act of defiance against the CIA, which has reportedly concluded that the Saudi prince ordered the killing, and the Senate, which is considering bipartisan legislation that would suspend weapons sales to Saudi Arabia among other punitive measures. He told reporters at the White House that the CIA \u201cdidn\u2019t make a determination\u201d on the murder, and that they had \u201cnothing definitive\u201d on its perpetrator. The claim is contradicted by multiple reports that the intelligence agency has concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the hit on the former Saudi insider who had become a persistent critic. In his written statement, Trump wrote: \u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t! \u201cThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d As he has in the past with Vladimir Putin, Trump put official denials of wrongdoing from Riyadh on a par with US intelligence assessments. He said: \u201cKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr Khashoggi.\u201d The president acknowledged that Congress might have another view and the strength of congressional opinion soon became apparent when the Republican senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 otherwise a fervent Trump fan \u2013 issuing a statement predicting \u201cstrong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms\u201d. The South Carolina senator added: \u201cWhile Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the crown prince \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic.\u201d The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee sent a joint letter to the president on Tuesday evening demanding he make a clear official statement to Congress on the prince\u2019s involvement in the murder Fred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, said: \u201cThe CIA has thoroughly investigated the murder of this innocent journalist and concluded with high confidence that it was directed by the crown prince. If there is reason to doubt the findings of the CIA, President Trump should immediately make that evidence public.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement, titled \u201cstanding with Saudi Arabia\u201d sought to portray the kingdom as an essential US ally in a struggle against Iran, and an irreplaceable customer for US arms sales. He claimed a breach in the relationship between Washington and Riyadh would produce an oil price spike. \u201cIf you want to go see oil prices go to $150 a barrel, all you have to do is break up our relationship with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Trump said in his remarks to reporters. His statement made a series of false or unsubstantiated claims, suggesting that Riyadh is buying $110bn in US weapons. The actual total of offers since Trump took office is less than $15bn, and the value of actual signed contracts is significantly lower than that. A new independent report found that US arms sales to Saudi Arabia account for fewer than 20,000 US jobs a year \u2013 less than a 20th of the employment boost Donald Trump has claimed. Trump said in his statement: \u201cThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone.\u201d He pointed out that the US has imposed individual sanctions on 17 Saudis identified by Riyadh for their alleged involvement in the 2 October murder. The president said that \u201crepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\u201d. Trump added: \u201cMy decision is in no way based on that.\u201d But he did not explain why he mentioned the smear against Khashoggi at all. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, when asked about the Saudi monarchy\u2019s complicity in Khashoggi\u2019s death, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there.\u201d Pompeo declined to comment on intelligence assessments of the murder, but said: \u201cFacts will obviously still continue to come to light. I\u2019m confident of that. It\u2019s the way the world works.\u201d Nicholas Burns, the under-secretary of state for political affairs in the George W Bush administration, said: \u201cThis Trump statement on the Khashoggi murder is beyond embarrassing. It is shameful.He is silent on our most important interest \u2013 justice.\u201d Trump\u2019s enthusiastic support for Riyadh coincides with a drive by the crown prince to rehabilitate himself on the world stage. The Argentinian government confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that he is on the list of attendees at the G20 summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires. Also on the guest list is Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has condemned Riyadh for the murder and whose government has put out a steady stream of leaks from the investigation, pointing towards Saudi government culpability at the highest levels. In the latest of those leaks, the influential pro-government outlet Habert\u00fcrk published excerpts of a purported transcript of an audio recording of the murder. According to its account, the Saudi hitman chosen as a lookalike among Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassins was apparently recorded saying: \u201cIt\u2019s creepy to wear the clothes of a man we killed 20 minutes ago.\u201d He then he stepped from the Kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in a failed attempt to prove the murdered dissident had left the building. The chilling detail was among the latest excerpts released by Turkish officials seven weeks after Khashoggi was murdered. Other details include Khashoggi demanding, \u201cRelease my arm, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d moments after entering the diplomatic mission. A listening device inside the consulate apparently captured Maher Mutreb, a trusted aide of Prince Mohammed, replying: \u201cTraitor, you will be brought to account.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
