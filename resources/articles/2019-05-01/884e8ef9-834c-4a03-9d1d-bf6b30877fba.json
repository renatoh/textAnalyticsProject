I don\u2019t want to be regarded as a female pundit. I\u2019m a pundit.\u201d That is Alex Scott\u2019s hope but the former Arsenal right-back turned broadcaster is so regularly a target for abuse that it almost forced her off social media. \u201cGosh, yeah,\u201d she sighs, when asked whether she gets abuse. \u201cI would say so, yeah. Twitter, every week, every single day now. Constantly. \u201cDo you know what? I went through a stage over Christmas where it got a lot to handle, the scrutiny of it. I\u2019ve always been a positive person and that\u2019s when I put out a tweet about it because I was like: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to come off Twitter and away from social media.\u2019\u201d She changed her mind, though, \u201cI\u2019ve always been a strong presence on social media. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve connected with my fans and in doing that I\u2019m allowing them to win. What keeps me going is knowing that I\u2019m helping change things. I get people coming up to me in the street saying they watch with their daughters, or sons; it\u2019s normalising it. Me sitting there, being strong enough to give my opinions.\u201d It is not all negative. Many spring to the defence of female pundits. There was outcry during the World Cup in Russia when Patrice Evra patronisingly applauded Eni Aluko. Scott\u2019s social media mentions soared when Graeme Souness interrupted her at half-time during Manchester United\u2019s win against Leicester in February. The 34-year-old looks at it in a different way. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m on with Graeme I get more comments about that than when I\u2019m on with any other pundit. But Graeme Souness is like that. Whether it be with me, how he reacted to [presenter] David Jones, he\u2019s the same. If he\u2019s got a disagreement and he sits alongside you he\u2019s going to say it. I actually respect that. \u201cThat\u2019s how I want people to be with me. Not everyone agrees. If you disagree with me I want you to tell me and I\u2019m going to come back and tell you why it\u2019s my opinion. I wouldn\u2019t want Graeme to change and be different just because I\u2019m a female. Treat me the same.\u201d Part of the criticism of Scott comes from a perception that she essentially walked off the pitch and into the studio. Little is known of the work behind the scenes to prepare for life after playing. She never wanted to be a coach and always had media ambitions. Before the 2015 World Cup, she says: \u201cWe had our warm-up game against Canada and I was sending in my dissertation the night before. I was preparing for a World Cup and finishing my degree in media. \u201cI knew that obviously I would be getting: \u2018She doesn\u2019t deserve to be there.\u2019 I never want anyone to think I\u2019ve been given a helping hand. I\u2019ve always worked for everything, whether it be on the football field or away from it. I never wanted anyone to have anything over me, so I made sure I got a degree as well as getting the experience. I wrote for the Independent during the men\u2019s 2014 World Cup and our World Cup.\u201d That level of preparation has led to her success as a pundit. Although there have been detractors, Scott has been overwhelmingly welcomed. Does she feel she has had to work harder? \u201cI can\u2019t compare myself to what others do but I want to do the job the best I can. I would not turn up at a World Cup not at the fitness level that I knew I could be. I knew before every game what my opponent would do. I do the same amount of work I did as a player as a pundit.\u201d Four years on from a bronze medal in Canada, the Lionesses head to France. Expectations are a lot higher and Scott will be behind the microphone rather than on the pitch. At the 2015 World Cup her role had already shifted. \u201cThat tournament on the one hand was my most enjoyable, on the other hand it was hard. I lost my starting place, as right-back, to Lucy Bronze. But I was going through a transition then in my life, where I knew I was coming towards the end. I thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019m not starting, but what can I do?\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s why me and Lucy are still so close because she knows what I\u2019ve done to help her in that environment and help her become the best. I had that. When I went over to the US it was Heather Mitts, who was one of the best full-backs in the world. I ultimately took her place at club level but what Heather did for me was she always made sure I stayed back after training working on weaknesses and that always stayed with me: helping your teammates to be better.\u201d If England win the World Cup, Scott believes it will be transformative. \u201cI already feel like women\u2019s football is on the cusp of something special; the investment, the brands, everyone knows it\u2019s a moment to get involved. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the World Cup, it\u2019s the Olympics, a home Euros. There\u2019s momentum behind women\u2019s football now, which is great. But if England go and win the World Cup it will be like the \u201999ers in the US. That took US soccer to a whole new level. Everyone was then invested, they are still reaping the rewards of them winning it. But if England don\u2019t? I still think the momentum is there.\u201d Alex Scott is part of the BBC Women\u2019s World Cup presenting team.
