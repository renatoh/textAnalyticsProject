The US attorney general, Eric Holder, told a press conference in Washington he would be seeking the death penalty. The decision immediately raised fears among some that the trial, to be held about 10 blocks from the site of the Twin Towers, could make New York a renewed target for terrorist attack. The emotive decision to hold the trial so close to Ground Zero presents a host of legal and political consequences. President Obama, speaking at a press conference during a trip to Japan, said he was sure Mohammed would receive a fair trial, in spite of the problems of finding unbiased jurors in New York, and of evidence being tainted by torture. \"I am absolutely convinced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be subjected to the most exacting demands of justice. The American people insist on it, and my administration insists on it,\" he said. The move is part of a promise by the Obama administration to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention centre by January, a timetable that has slipped. More than 200 are still detained there. There was a mixed reaction to the decision, with civil liberties groups, who have long campaigned for the detainees to be transferred to US soil, tentatively welcoming the prospect of a civil trial with its constitutional safeguards. But Republicans expressed concern not only about the threat posed to New Yorkers, but that being tried in a civilian court might mean shorter sentences or even that the alleged plotters might be released. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: \"There are needless risks from this decision: classified information can be inadvertently leaked \u2026 our cities will face enormous security problems, and our communities will be potential targets for attack.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
