(Before you ask, we didn't open the email. How tolerant do you think EducationGuardian.co.uk is of porn?) For uncomplicated, clear-eyed romance where better to turn than to the increasingly fragrant Chelsea Clinton? The Mirror reports that \"crafty\" Chelsea has found a way to continue her Oxford romance with boyfriend Ian Krause by letting him move into a rented house in \"fashionable\" Jericho, a matter of minutes from the very house in which Chelsea's dad, Bill, didn't inhale. (And by the way, rented house in Jericho? We'd check the walls). While Chelsea herself still has her official residence in University College, Mr Krause's cunning ruse will mean they can spend the nights together away from the collegiate \"hothouse atmosphere\" (have The Mirror people been to Oxford?). The only prying eyes will be the students who share the flat with Mr Krause. Let's hope they are discreet. No, scrub that. Let's hope they're not. At least it may spare Chelsea the hideous embarrassment of last term when a college fire alarm went off and she was forced to shiver on the quad in a baggy pair of men's pyjamas until the fire brigade gave the all clear. Now everyone knows she sleeps with a man who wears pyjamas. The shame, the shame. Going down at term time There is nothing - well almost nothing - that this column likes more than cheap jokes. The Mirror gives us a glorious opportunity with the news that Hugh Grant's old \"friend\" Divine Brown is to be offered a scholarship at UCLA in California. But just as we take a deep breath to utter the inevitable low-grade witticism, we're beaten to it by an unnamed \"professor\" (not an in-house journalist, honest) who is quoted as saying: \"I can see it now, queues of students lining up for their orals.\" Oh, we were going to make a joke about siphoning off their grants. Perhaps best we don't. Whose turn to buy the biscuits We don't like to pander to national stereotypes here, but on a quiet week what do you expect us to do? So here goes: The French are all a bit arrogant and snooty. There, we've said it. But it's not just us, the French themselves have finally clicked. The Times reports that students at France's most respected college are considering legal action after being marked down for treating subordinates with arrogance during work experience. The Ecole Nationale d'Administration has penalised students under a new marking system for such failings as refusing to make coffee for the office secretary, for smirking at her homemade sandwiches and for leaving photocopies of their bottoms on her desk (some of those aren't true). Forty three students are threatening the college with the highest court in the land, saying that the penalties are arbitrary. Perhaps they're not picky after all. They just don't care who they snub. Pooh's phallocentric day The Independent reports that a heretical new book on Winnie the Pooh was launched this week, but not to universal acclaim. Postmodern Pooh by Frederic Crews, an emeritus professor from Cailfornia (Whereabouts? Look, if we had more information, we'd give it, OK?) was not exactly given the nod from AA Milne's estate, possibly because Professor Crews has recounted the arguments at an imaginary academic conference about the secret subtexts in AA Milne's books. Pooh nervously checks his crotch, declaims one character, Sisera Catheter, \"which offers no more reassurance of phallicity than he has gleaned from his voyeuristic gazing at Eeyore's rear end\". This sort of thing ensured that the publishers weren't allowed near the illustrations. We're not sure if they added ones of their own. Just so long as they don't start on Paddington, that's all we're saying. His relationship with Mr Gruber was always entirely above board and we'll fight to the death on that. You can skip this bit There is no end to the limits of human gullibility, as well we know when we find we're still being paid for this rubbish. Take \"luscious\" students Kerry Holroyd and Karina Avery. The People reports that these two are haunted by a saucy spook who is getting his \"frills\" (geddit?) - by stealing their bras and panties. Yes, it is important. The two return regularly home from nights out to find their underwear either missing or scattered around their flat, and they are now \"convinced\" that a kinky ghost is rifling through their drawers. Kerry, 19, said: \"Sometimes the items are on the floor and the furniture, or hung up in odd places. I found a thong on top of the microwave and another hanging from a light switch.\" Karina, 18, added: \"It's frightening. It's like the place has been ransacked, but only for our undies.\" Bizarrely, the ghost strikes only if the girls stay out past midnight. Kerry said: \"We think he fancies us and is jealous if we're out late, partying.\" Only Scooby Doo could really solve this, but who is the bigger idiot? The girls who \"believe\" there's a ghost? The People for printing big pictures of the two and their underwear? Or us for passing this drivel on? Name dropping The Independent on Sunday reports that Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner for human rights, spoke to an audience of students at the London School of Economics last week. Afterwards, the academic presiding, Professor Conor Gearty, invited questions, asking those picked to stand up and announce their names. As hands went up, he peered over his spectacles: \"lady in grey,\" he indicated. She dutifully obeyed his instructions. \"Good afternoon,\" she began, \"my name is Vanessa Redgrave.\" One other thing - she didn't half go on..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
