They don't get basic vaccines as babies and there is no health worker on hand to supply the oral rehydration therapy that can save the lives of small children with diarrhoea - which kills around 1.5 million a year. Child mortality is falling around the world. The millennium development goal to bring it down is thought to be on target. But SCF's report shows very clearly that the big picture can obscure the desperate situation of some of the poorest children. The initiatives intended to improve healthcare and save lives help those in the better-off families. The report looks at 25 developing countries and finds that 14% of their children live in healthcare deserts. But in some countries that may seem more prosperous, the gap between the haves and have-nots is much bigger. In Nigeria, 33% of children are classed as severely healthcare deprived - only just behind Ethiopia, where 38% live in healthcare deserts. India, with its huge population, has the highest number of children with no healthcare - 13 million have not been routinely vaccinated against diseases like diphtheria and tetanus and get no treatment for diarrhoea. Yet in both Nigeria and Ethiopia, child mortality figures improved in recent years. This is how the report explains it: Two factors emerge. Firstly, gains in child survival were unequal, with mortality rates falling more slowly among poorer quintiles that were also least likely to have access to healthcare. Secondly, factors other than healthcare \u2013 such as nutrition, water and sanitation, and maternal education \u2013 are likely to have made a significant contribution towards falling mortality. These areas merit further investigation. So clean water and maternal education and the rest have reduced child mortality - but the children who don't get vaccinated don't live in areas with sanitation and good nutrition either. And it stands to reason that if all children had received basic healthcare - defined as life-saving vaccinations and diarrhoea treatment - child mortality would have come down even further. While our analysis does not show causation between living in healthcare deserts and under-five mortality, it is worth noting a strong correlation, with children from the poorest households more likely to experience severe healthcare deprivation and to face a greater chance of dying before their fifth birthday than children from the richest households. Healthcare deserts boast few clinics or health workers. There is a global shortage of 3.5 million health workers globally. Most of the 25 countries in the report had fewer than the 23 per 10,000 people, which the World Health Organisation says is the minimum necessary. When health workers are few and far between, they are unlikely to be plentiful in the poorest neighbourhoods. SCF says that unless the healthcare deserts are tackled, the MDG child mortality goal will not be met - however promising the progress may have looked so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
