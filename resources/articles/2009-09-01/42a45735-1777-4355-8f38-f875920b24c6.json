About 2,000 primary and secondary schools are facing a deficit, with many forced to make redundancies and increase class sizes to cut costs \u2013 even before the widely predicted public spending cuts hit the education budget. The Liberal Democrats, who obtained the figures under the Freedom of Information Act, said the findings are the \"tip of the iceberg\" and that school standards will decline to levels not seen since the 1980s if education budgets are not protected in the looming cuts. The problem is being blamed on the current funding system, which is accused of not properly rewarding schools for teaching pupils in the poorest areas of the country. The local authorities worst affected include Haringey, north London, Knowsley in Merseyside, and Nottingham, which have some of the most entrenched educational problems in England. Two thirds of local authorities in England \u2013 101 in total \u2013 responded to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, revealing wide disparities in the proportion of schools projecting a deficit this year. In some of the poorest areas, more than one in three schools are struggling financially. Overall, 1,373 schools are projecting a deficit for this year. Repeated across the country, this would leave at least 2,000 schools in deficit. David Laws, the Lib Dem education spokesman, said: \"This is the tip of an iceberg which is likely to emerge rapidly as the squeeze on education budgets really bites over the next few years. We are likely to see school cash balances being rapidly run down, and we could soon be back to the bad old days of endless budget pressures and regular staff cuts.\" Laws is due to raise the issue at the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth this week. The party is proposing a \"pupil premium\" that would bring the funding levels for schools that teach pupils from the poorest postcodes in the country up to the level of private schools. Earlier this year, the Audit Commission accused some schools of hoarding money, revealing that schools collectively had a surplus of \u00a32bn last year. The fact that others are struggling in deficit will focus political attention on reforming the funding system to solve such shortfalls. Joan McVittie, headteacher of Woodside high school in Haringey, said she had not replaced 10 members of staff this year \u2013 including a deputy head \u2013 to stave off a deficit, but is still facing a shortfall of up to \u00a3500,000 next year. She had been forced to ask administrative staff to work as teaching assistants, but some class sizes had still increased. \"We're struggling to balance budgets every year,\" she said. News of deficits comes amid widespread concerns about the future of spending on education, with both Labour and the Conservatives refusing to protect the schools budget, and suggestions that the public sector could see 10% cuts over the next four years. Suffolk county council this week announced it is putting on hold plans to restructure its schools amid concerns about the uncertain funding climate. John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he had seen a spike in schools approaching his organisation for advice on how to prepare for future cuts in their budgets. \"Heads are very concerned at the prospect of lower budgets at a time of continuing higher expectations. A very high proportion of the schools budget is spent on staffing and any serious budget cuts are certain to lead to redundancies. If schools need to balance the books, that's the first place they will look,\" he said. Vernon Coaker, the schools minister, said funding was at record levels and schools were guaranteed a 2.1%-a-year increase until 2011. He criticised the survey as \"partial\", covering only 101 of 158 English authorities.\"The number of schools in deficit has been stable for 10 years and there is no evidence to suggest that this year will be any different \u2026 we expect no deficit to be set without a clear recovery plan to eliminate it within three years,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
