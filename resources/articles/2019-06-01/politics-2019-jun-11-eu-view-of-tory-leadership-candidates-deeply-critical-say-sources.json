With Theresa May soon to leave 10 Downing Street, Brussels is tuning in to the Westminster drama of the Tory leadership race \u2013 with both amazement and exasperation. \u201cPeople in Brussels are fed up that the political class in the UK has gone a little bit crazy,\u201d Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council\u2019s legal service said. British politicians seemed to have gone \u201con holiday\u201d, since gaining the extension, he added. For the EU, the bookies\u2019 favourite Boris Johnson, is a Trumpian figure whose disputed claims and bombastic rhetoric played a major role in plunging the UK into what is seen in Brussels as the Brexit nightmare. The former foreign secretary is remembered for his early 1990s stint as Brussels correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name mocking EU regulations, promoting what the European commission calls \u201cEuromyths\u201d. He achieved wider prominence for his claims during the EU referendum campaign. \u201cHe lied a lot to the British people,\u201d the then French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in 2016. \u201cThe idea of Boris Johnson in the European council is probably quite abhorrent to some EU leaders,\u201d an EU source said. \u201cBoris is known in foreign policy circles, certainly not respected. He\u2019s also seen as part of a wider Trump world and no one wants that.\u201d The EU\u2019s most senior civil servant, Martin Selmayr, once described a Johnson premiership as a \u201chorror scenario\u201d, classing him with Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump. Many EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister. \u201cFor me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,\u201d said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. \u201cHe was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,\u201d the first EU source said. The European commission recently accused Raab of making \u201cfraudulent\u201d claims and spreading \u201cpure disinformation\u201d in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland. Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that it \u201cprobably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain\u2019s interests were resolutely defended\u201d. Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. \u201cHe gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,\u201d an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d. EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party\u2019s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party won the most votes. \u201cThe Tory party will be in survival mode and \u2026 will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,\u201d another EU source said. For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October. More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU. Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste. \u201cWe were definitely on the other side of Macron,\u201d the diplomat recalled. \u201cNow I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.\u201d \u201c[Macron] closed the door [to another extension] and it\u2019s not shut, but the wind is blowing against it. And the harder Johnson\u2019s rhetoric, and harder Raab\u2019s rhetoric, the harder it is to open the door.\u201d Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was \u201cnothing promising\u201d in \u201cthe state of affairs in London\u201d. Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as \u201ca democratic event\u201d, meaning a general election or a second referendum. Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. \u201cBut even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.\u201d He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an individual Tory leader. \u201cIt is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.\u201d Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May\u2019s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. \u201cAnyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Tory contest is not keeping Brussels on the edge of its seat. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care very much [who wins]\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cFrom an EU point of view, we would rather see someone that could deliver a smooth, orderly Brexit. Whether Johnson is going to be able to deliver it, the UK is going to have to ask itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
