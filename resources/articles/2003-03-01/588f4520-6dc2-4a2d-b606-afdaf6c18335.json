Chanel and St Laurent taught the world chic and couture and today the biggest names in luxury goods - Herm\u00e8s, Dior, Louis Vuitton - cluster on the right bank of the Seine. Forget the city of love; Paris is the city of style. Or, at least, it used to be. In an era when Italian and American designers have knocked the stuffing out of fashion, crossing the channel for a weekend's wardrobe revision has become as stiff and constraining as a French corset. Fashion folk have declared the city of chignoned ladies 'Naf Naf', and now more often they head for Milan, New York and even 'le Londray'. Parisians are not the sort of people who take being stood up lying down, and they have been busy giving the French capital a vogueish new look. Out go starchy Louis XIV hotels, pink jolie madame stores and staff who look down their noses at you and check the labels on your clothes before deigning to sell you so much as a flip-flop. In their place, modern palaces and stores are sprouting up like mushrooms, from Place Vend\u00f4me to Avenue Montaigne. More scenic than the gym! More stylish than jogging! I'm off for a luxury 'walk-out' along the new fashion boulevard to see if Paris matches Milan and Madison Avenue. The French capital beats the competition when it comes to making an entrance. With airports worse by the day, settling into an Arne Jacobsen Egg chair in the Eurostar lounge at Waterloo before boarding a Philippe Starck-designed carriage for the three-hour run to the Gare du Nord has never felt better - which is just as well because the Park Hyatt Paris Vend\u00f4me is the last place you want to arrive looking more Helmut Kohl than Helmut Lang. Forget the 'greed is good' grandeur of the Four Seasons in New York. Check out of Ian Schrager's latest 'lifestyle statement'. The Park Hyatt Paris Vend\u00f4me is the modern city hotel in which to order your Martini. Ed Tuttle, the designer behind the ultra-fashionable Aman resorts, spent 10 years knocking five belle epoque houses on the Rue de la Paix into a modern palace with a slow-release 'wow' factor. This is a hotel you 'discover' - and the more you discover, the more you're seduced. I start with my mahogany, limestone and gold room, with its matt bronze bathroom and dressing room, before moving down to sit by the open fire in the salon, where staff combine French attention to detail with Italian levels of charm. Wandering out, I make my way to the bar with its whiskies, absinthe and 400-strong cigar menu. The following day, I make it up to the roof terrace, where I look down on my stuffy old neighbours in the giant patisserie that is the Ritz, before heading to the restaurant for modern French cui sine: potato waffle with caviar, chateaubriand, Comte de Chalet cheese and spiced sorbet. If this is the new Paris, I can't wait to get to the shops. Paris's new fashion boulevard starts in the hotel itself. Tuttle chose the rejuvenated Dunhill as his 'hotel shop'. There are no postcards or caps in this boudoir-red boutique, just the 'classic with a twist' suits, leather jackets, pens, bags and watches that fill the wardrobes of Mr and Mrs Madonna. Turning right out of the store, I cross Place Vend\u00f4me. Standing proudly in the centre of the square is a statue of Napoleon dressed as a Roman emperor. I have something a little more modern in mind, so it's past Cartier and into Armani to order a new made-to-measure 'Sartoriale' suit. Leaving the square, I turn left into Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 and head for Colette, Paris's answer to Milan's 'in the know' boutique, 10 Corso Como. The rails are sparsely decorated with the edgiest pieces from big name and lesser-known designers - Prada, Miu Miu, Gucci, Dries van Noten, Raf Simons and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Downstairs, you can buy that all-important Dior carry-case for your Apple iPod while sipping limited edition bottled eau in the water bar. Doubling back down Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9, I reach Stephane Marais, the studio-cum-beauty boutique which no woman will let a man go to Paris without visiting. I stock up on his signature cosmetics before they reach London's Space NK. Further down and left a bit and it's girls' stuff again. Haute cobbler Manolo Blahnik, currently strutting his stilettos at London's Design Museum, has just opened his first Paris boutique on Rue du Mont Thabor. At the end is Costume National's first stand-alone store in the French capital. Back on Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9, there are so many new shops it's hard to know where to start. Bottega Veneta for overnight bags in ponyskin and crocodile with matching loafers? John Galliano for his high-end homage to street chic? Versace for a little 'razzle dazzle 'em' style? Chanel for the kind of sportswear Miuccia Prada wishes she'd come up with? Chlo\u00e9 for fun? With so much so new, it's a relief to see 'Le Papa' of Paris stores a few blocks down on the corner. Ever since Herm\u00e8s first stitched a saddle almost 200 years ago, the world has fallen for its luxe leathers. The wallets, shoes and coats in Maison Herm\u00e8s - this is no mere magasin - remind you of the time when anything chic came from France. Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 leads straight to the end of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where the new Gucci 'grand apartment' lords it over the junction with Avenue Montaigne. Even if you don't want to cane your credit on a \u00a31,000 pair of bespoke crocodile-skin Chelsea boots, go in and sweep up and down the stone and mahogany curved staircase. On the right, down Avenue Montaigne, the founding father of modern minimalism, Calvin Klein, makes the French connection with his only collection store outside New York. A Bulgari silk tie and a pair of Dolce &amp; Gabbana pimp loafers later, and I swing right, past the Eiffel Tower and up into Avenue George V, which is the home of big-money couture - Givenchy, where princesses get wrapped for weddings, as well as the more affordable Jean-Paul Gaultier. At the top of the road I bypass the Japanese ram-raiders clamouring for the latest patent tote bag in Louis Vuitton and head instead for perhaps the best-loved shop in Paris. Tucked behind the George V Hotel in Avenue Pierre-1er-de-Serbie is Creed. The last family-owned fragrance house in France has been getting up the noses of bon vivants since the business was founded in 1760. George III, Winston Churchill, Grace Kelly, Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, Madonna and David Bowie have all fallen for its delicate mixes of rose, bergamot, mandarin, musk, iris and sandalwood. I leave with a chunky green glass bottle of Acier Aluminium, a metallic number that smells like fresh air - only better. Wandering back to the Park Hyatt after a work-out that has lightened my wallet more than my waistline, I wonder whether Paris has done enough to regain its crown as the capital of fashion. The city feels like a grande dame from the seizieme arrondissement who has cast aside her old-school suits and gone out and bought a new wardrobe from one of Paris's new crop of enfants terribles - Dior, Galliano, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. If you fancy a splash-out spree, pay her a visit. All she asks is that your credit is good and that you are a connoisseur of le look moderne. Top places to shop until you drop Colette, 213 Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 Drink limited-edition Evian while enjoying this tightly edited multi-brand boutique. Comme des Garcons, 54 Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9. After caning your credit on the clothes, hang out in the red fibreglass cocoon and spin in computerised chairs. Dunhill, 15 Rue de la Paix With its white-shirt bar, bespoke leather jackets and vintage homewares, this is an iconic treasure house of old. What you find here, you won't find in any other Dunhill store. Not French - but worth the Eurostar ticket alone. Creed, 38 Avenue Pierre-1er-de-Serbie Ask to speak to Olivier Creed, 'the world's greatest living nose' at this fragrance store. Try Silver Mountain Water, Green Irish Tweed and Fleurissimo, created for Grace Kelly's wedding. Stephane Marais, 217 Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 The cosmetics look more like an exhibition in progress than a shop. Pick up their 'roll of film' catalogues. Bottega Veneta, 16 Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 Press the ' Poussez' button, watch the door slide open and walk into an interior as dark and seductive as a box of chocolates. Herm\u00e8s, 24 Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 Order a bespoke shirt with your favourite collar - petit col souple, col smoking. Find out what the city has in store \u00b7 Arrive on a Friday and stay until Tuesday. Most shops are closed on Sunday and some do not reopen until Monday afternoon. \u00b7 Unless you're heading for the flea markets, don't expect bargains. Prices are about the same as in Britain. \u00b7 Don't worry if you speak 'fashion' better than French. France - at last - has abandoned the delusion that everyone speaks its language. \u00b7 Although Rue Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 is the best place to shop, department stores Le Printemps and Galeries Lafayette, both on Boulevard Haussmann, have been revamped and are worth a visit. \u00b7 When your purse can't take it any more, head for the bar at the theatrical Hotel Costes or walk along the Jardin des Tuileries to the Louvre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
