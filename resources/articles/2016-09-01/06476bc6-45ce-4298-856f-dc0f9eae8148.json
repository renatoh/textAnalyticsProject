Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s increasingly agitated body language told its own story as stoppage time began with Norwich City leading 3-2 and poised to collect three points but Alex Neil\u2019s world was about to be turned upside down. When, six added minutes later, the referee finally blew his whistle, last-gasp goals from Yoan Gouffran and Dwight Gayle \u2013 who registered a hat-trick \u2013 had sheared through mounting despair on Tyneside to leave Newcastle third, a point behind Norwich and three in arrears of the leaders, Huddersfield Town. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of my players,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWe deserved to win but had bad luck and it was incredible to go 3-1 down at one point. I\u2019m really pleased we got our good luck back at the end. This kind of result can be very important for team spirit. It can be very important for our future.\u201d Neil needed several gulps of water before speaking. \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated, disappointed, there\u2019s so many emotions.\u201d Who could have imagined that? Initially the night had been all about a cagey counterattacking visiting gameplan and Gayle\u2019s struggles to score. Newcastle\u2019s No9 finally succeeded by turning in Matt Ritchie\u2019s cross from close range after he had missed three presentable openings. Norwich were seeking a sixth straight win but it seemed they had no answers to either Jonjo\u2019s Shelvey\u2019s central midfield vision and incision or Newcastle\u2019s crossing ability, with DeAndre Yedlin and Ritchie creating havoc down the right. Karl Darlow had been a virtual bystander until Graham Dorrans equalised from the penalty spot after Gouffran fouled Robbie Brady. Suitably galvanised, Dorrans began reminding everyone that Shelvey was not the only player on the pitch capable of hitting devastating long passes and, almost imperceptibly, Newcastle were on the back foot. When they failed to clear Jacob Murphy\u2019s cross, Cameron Jerome was allowed to come inside, switch feet and direct a fabulous curling shot into the top corner. Ben\u00edtez\u2019s discomfort grew as Murphy\u2019s long-range shot took a hefty deflection off Jamaal Lascelles and flew beyond a wrong-footed Darlow. Neil\u2019s turn to swear came as Gayle controlled Shelvey\u2019s through ball adroitly before his shot beat Michael McGovern. The Scot\u2019s language deteriorated further as Gouffran and Gayle ripped up the night\u2019s narrative, the former heading in Yedlin\u2019s cross and the latter turning and shooting low past Norwich\u2019s distraught goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
