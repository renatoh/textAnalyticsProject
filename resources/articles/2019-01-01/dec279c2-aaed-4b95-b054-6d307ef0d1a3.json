Some of the country\u2019s best cyclists past and present \u2013 Amanda Spratt, Simon Gerrans, Robbie McEwen \u2013 have been crowned champion after triumphing on these treacherous Ballarat hills. But Buninyong has never before seen someone quite like Sarah Gigante. Just 18, the Victorian had already impressed by winning the road race, time trial and criterium trifecta at last year\u2019s Under-19 national championships. Those feats, though, pale in comparison to her achievement of last Sunday. Riding against Australia\u2019s best female riders, including world No 2 Spratt, Gigante attacked on the penultimate lap. Barely days into her first season out of the junior ranks, the recent high school graduate held off a determined chase to win both the elite and Under-23 categories \u2013 an Australian first. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it \u2013 this is a dream come true,\u201d Gigante tells Guardian Australia. Having joined an early breakaway on the first lap, the youngster stayed with the front group as its numbers dwindled. When a small gap emerged between her, Sarah Roy and Shara Gillow, Gigante seized the opportunity. \u201cWhen the gap opened it was a complete surprise. I thought: \u2018it is now or never \u2013 I may as well try.\u2019 It really paid off.\u201d The magnitude of Gigante\u2019s upset is unprecedented. She was racing against the might of World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, the second-best female team in the world, in one of the longest races she had ever contested. Victory should not have been possible. \u201cThe win did not sink in at all on Sunday \u2013 it was just a complete dream,\u201d says Gigante. \u201cI went to sleep in my national championship jersey \u2013 when I woke up the next morning it felt a bit more real.\u201d Gigante\u2019s Buninyong glory caps a remarkable reversal of fortune. Last May the Victorian broke her elbow, shoulder and wrist following a club race crash. When Gigante told doctors she needed to be back racing by August, to contest the junior track world championships, they laughed. Yet with a concerted rehabilitation effort, Gigante found herself at the world championships \u2013 claiming silver in the points race. She backed up a month later to represent Australia in the junior category of the road world championships in Austria, before flying home to sit her final exams. Although unable to write for several months during the school year due to her injuries \u2013 she instead relied on her mother to transcribe homework \u2013 Gigante received a perfect Atar score of 99.95. Despite her pride at the result \u2013 securing a place studying science at the University of Melbourne \u2013 Gigante says the green and gold stripes are an even bigger achievement. \u201cThis is more exciting than my Atar,\u201d she laughs. Gigante is also quick to acknowledge the role of her family in her recent successes. \u201cMy family are proud of me no matter what,\u201d she says. \u201cThis victory is icing on the cake \u2013 but they love me for the passion I have and the hard work I put in.\u201d 2019 will see Gigante commence her university studies and race domestically and internationally with Roxsolt-Attaquer. She may have a busy year ahead, but after enduring a trying 2018 Gigante is not phased. \u201cLast year was really tough with year 12, the injuries and lengthy recovery period. As long as something like that does not happen again it won\u2019t be too bad.\u201d With her dual academic and sporting ambitions, it remains unclear where Gigante\u2019s future will lead. \u201cI want to take cycling as far as I can,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the sport and have ever since I started when I was eight. Hopefully I can keep doing that for a long time coming, keeping improving and keep going overseas. But it is good to have balance \u2013 studying gives me something to fall back on. Cycling can change so quickly.\u201d She may be wearing national colours in 2019 \u2013 something she admits is \u201cquite the honour\u201d \u2013 but Gigante is not getting ahead of herself. Asked about the 2020 Olympics, she modestly demurs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Tokyo is on my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is a long way in the future \u2013 two years away. Anything can happen. I will just focus on the now.\u201d Barely an adult, Gigante is already a national champion, has represented Australia internationally in two cycling disciplines and aced her year 12 exams. Is there anything this friendly young rider, mature beyond her years, does not excel at? \u201cCleaning my room,\u201d she quips."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
