James, that is, not David. This claims to be Britain's first 3D film festival, and there's not a blue-skinned interplanetary saga in sight. Instead, it promises a more DIY strain of stereoscopic action. As enthusiasts have discovered, it's not all that difficult to make your own 3D camera \u2013 just strap two regular 2D cameras together and you're ready. Hosted by short film regulars Short &amp; Sweet, this single-night festival promises more in-your-face auteurism from around the world than you can shake a stick out of a screen at. Barbican Screen, EC2, Fri, shortandsweet.tv/3D Greenwich Film Festival, London Greenwich seems to be one of the most cinema-saturated places in the country, what with the O2 and Odeon multiplexes. But this festival ignores all of that and instead brings cinema to the district's other attractions. For example, what better place to see Jane Fonda's camp 41st-century space classic Barbarella than the plush planetarium of the Royal Observatory, in fancy dress? Or you can take Ang Lee's Sense And Sensibility in the stately surroundings of Inigo Jones's Queen's House at the National Maritime Museum, where it was partly filmed. Alternatively, there's a bona fide drive-in screening of Grease in Avery Hill Park, with classic cars, rock'n'roll dancing, and picnicking space (pedestrians go free). Among other things, there are also free family films every Friday (such as Pixar's Up and lush Bollywood melodrama Devdas) at the Woolwich big screen, in General Gordon Square. Various venues, Fri to 30 Jul, visit bit.ly/greenwichfilmfest London Indian Film Festival, London The world's largest film industry doesn't just churn out populist song-and-dance melodramas, but you'd be forgiven for thinking so over here \u2013 that's all we get of the 1,000-odd films India makes every year. Which is where this little festival comes in, showcasing the indier side of India. Things are hotting up, as evidenced by opening film Love, Sex Aur Dhokha, which experiments with surveillance camera voyeurism and challenged the censors with its racy content. Dev D, meanwhile, brings the much-filmed story of Devdas up to date with druggy, music video-style visuals and a hip score, while at the other end of the spectrum, Vihir (The Well) brings arthouse cinematography and restrained dramatic values to a village tale that's full of big questions. Various venues, Thu to 20 Jul, londonindianfilmfestival.co.uk Isolation, On tour Starting out from the sobering statistic that one in four of Britain's ex-servicemen spend time on the streets, the documentary Isolation aims to highlight the plight of our forgotten, homeless soldiers \u2013 most of whom are wounded physically or psychologically. Former soldier Stuart Griffiths, who himself slept rough on civvy street, talks to some of these casualties with an insider's understanding. Ken Loach has given it his seal of approval; see for yourself at these special screenings with a score performed by director Luke Seomore.
