This was a huge match for Andrew Strauss, both as a batsman and a leader, and it just confirms what I've always believed: talent will only get you so far, but character will get you further. We kept hearing from these Australians before the series started what a good side they were, but there's only one captain under pressure at the moment and it isn't Strauss. People criticised his decision not to enforce the follow-on on Saturday morning, but they don't seem to realise the follow-on is over-rated in the modern game. Sides bat deeper now, pitches are flatter and more games are back to back. If Australia had batted third, a tired England side might have been chasing 200 on the last day, with all the pressure that comes with fourth-innings run chases. Strauss did the correct thing in all but batting Australia out of the game. It's true that one day a team will get 500 to win, but Strauss made his decision and he stuck with it. I have no problem with that. The armchair critics reminded me of the tour of the Caribbean, when Strauss was called over-conservative because of the timing of a couple of declarations. But you have to remember the background. England were still recovering from the Kevin Pietersen-Peter Moores fiasco and the 51 all out debacle in Jamaica, and there were problems in the dressing room. It's easy to snipe from the sidelines, but sometimes you have to play it safe as a captain before you feel bold enough to take risks. Strauss and Andy Flower deserve a lot of credit for re-building the side after losing the series in the West Indies and the most refreshing aspect of all is how positive the captain is being. The way they came at Australia in this game reminded me of 2005, when we relied on the truth of that old mantra about attack being the best form of defence. It's one thing for a captain to preach positivity; it's another for the team to put it into action, and that reflects well on Strauss. As a batsman, what we're seeing now is the culmination of years of hard work and application. Strauss reminds me of Gary Kirsten, the South Africa opener I worked with at Western Province. Like Strauss, Kirsten was a left-hander who knew his technical limitations but also knew how to get the best out of himself. Both have very resilient minds and a determination that puts more talented players to shame. Strauss could be stubborn at times, a good example being when he was struggling to play Shane Warne early on in 2005 and we disagreed about how to adapt his technique. But he was brave enough to approach me after the first Test, and he listened well and learned quickly, so much so that by the end of the series he had taken two hundreds off the Aussie attack. He's maturing as a skipper too. Suddenly you look at his opposite number and wonder which of the two has been captain for five years non-stop. As I've said before Ponting was never really under pressure when he had those greats in his bowling attack, because his players captained themselves. Now his prickly side is coming out, both in Cardiff and again at Lord's. As for Strauss, he will be delighted that Andrew Flintoff chipped in with that long-overdue five-wicket haul. England have been looking for him to perform in Tests for some time, and it looks like his decision to retire from Tests has freed him up to a degree. I just hope his body stands up to the rigours of back-to-back games. England must now keep up the momentum. We've seen before how they often play better when their backs are against the wall. It happened in 2005 after we lost the first Test at Lord's and we saw it on the last day at Cardiff. That means, injuries permitting, they should pick the same XI at Edgbaston, where they had been doing well in recent years until they lost to South Africa there last summer. If Strauss continues to lead them as he has done so far, I believe they will be absolutely fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
