No matter how staggering the evidence, or loud the cries for justice, its president, Thomas Bach, has resisted sanctions. On Tuesday in Lausanne, however, the IOC finally had no choice but to act. The truth had at last overwhelmed its diffidence \u2013 and defences. It came from the former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid, who confirmed there had been \u201csystemic manipulation\u201d of anti-doping results at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and elsewhere, by the Russian state \u2013 and the evidence was not only extensive but \u201cwatertight\u201d. Even Bach, a good friend of the Russia president, Vladimir Putin, felt compelled to call it an \u201cunprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport\u201d. By the time Bach, spoke the world knew of Russia\u2019s punishment. Its Olympic Committee had been suspended from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang in February, and its deputy prime minister for sport, Vitaly Mutko, banned from the Olympics for life for his part in the deception. Meanwhile the Russian Olympic Committee was fined $15m (\u00a311.2m) to reimburse the IOC\u2019s costs and to improve the capacity and integrity of the global anti-doping system. Given the breathtaking extent of their crimes, some will believe the punishments should have been deeper and the fines far steeper. Russia was, in effect, convicted of state-sponsored doping over a thousand athletes in 30 sports after all. Meanwhile Mutko somehow remains in charge of next year\u2019s World Cup, which will be held in Russia. You might think this would raise an eyebrow at Fifa, especially given dozens of the country\u2019s footballers are under suspicion for being part of the doping programme \u2013 especially given that Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory turned whistleblower, gave a 52-page affidavit to Schmid detailing dozens of meetings with Mutko. Yet less than an hour after the IOC\u2019s decision in Lausanne, Fifa insisted it had \u201cno impact on the preparations for the 2018 World Cup as we continue to work to deliver the best possible event\u201d. Perhaps we should not be surprised. Football\u2019s governing body has never cared much about the grubbier side of the game. Significantly the verdict was welcomed by anti-doping and athletes groups. Many of them recognised there was no perfect solution but were pleased the IOC had finally took firmer action. As Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, put it: \u201cOver the past three years, a high-stakes game of chicken has been played between those willing to sacrifice the Olympic ideals by employing a state-directed doping program to cheat to win and, on the other side, athletes unwilling to stand silent while their hopes and dreams were stolen and the Olympic Games hijacked. The IOC listened to those who matter most \u2013 and clean athletes won a significant victory.\u201d Russia was thrown a lifeline, though, with the IOC agreeing its athletes will get to compete in Pyeongchang \u2013 albeit under a neutral flag and with the words \u201cOlympic athlete from Russia\u201d on their jerseys, providing they can show they are not tainted by Mutko\u2019s regime. That seems fair enough \u2013 this was always about justice not vengeance, and that applies to clean Russian athletes, too. However it was ironic the solution the IOC came up was nearly identical to that implemented by the International Association of Athletics Federations before the Rio Olympics. Seventeen months ago Bach had sniffed at its proposal. Now he embraced it. Bach explained this reversal by insisting a great deal had changed since the IOC waved through most of Russia\u2019s athletes into the Rio Games. \u201cAt the time of Rio we had not the opportunity to follow due process,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was mainly about the failure of the Moscow laboratory \u2013 now it is about the manipulation of the Sochi laboratory.\u201d Such an explanation is clearly disingenuous. By May 2016 the world knew through Rodchenkov\u2019s evidence that agents from Russia\u2019s secret service, the FSB, had found out how to open the supposedly tamper-proof bottles used to collect urine from athletes and had switched samples that would have otherwise tested positive for steroids with clean ones in Sochi. Rodchenkov also claimed that at least 15 medal winners were involved. The first of two reports by Richard McLaren, published in July 2016, also linked this conspiracy to the heart of the Russian government, saying Mutko as Russia\u2019s sports minister from 2008 to 2016 had issued direct orders to \u201cmanipulate particular samples\u201d. Yes, most countries have a problem with doping but it was obvious long before Tuesday that Russia\u2019s problem was unique in its scale and scope. The IOC was aware of it, too, but chose not to act. Incredibly, Bach said he believed the decision would \u201cdraw a line\u201d despite years of state\u2011sponsored doping in Russia, noting Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russia\u2019s Olympic Committee, had issued an apology, something global regulators have long requested. But while Bach wants to swiftly move on, for others it will not be so easy. As Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyer, Jim Walden, explained, the whistleblower is still in hiding and facing death threats for speaking out. \u201cMy hope is that the situation improves but the Kremlin has proved to be a very determined and difficult adversary for Grigory,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows that he\u2019s going to be looking over this shoulder for the rest of his life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
