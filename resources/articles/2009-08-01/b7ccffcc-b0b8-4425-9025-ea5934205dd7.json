This has been a trying World Cup qualifying campaign for George Burley, his first as Scotland manager, beset by petulant retirements, night and day drinking sessions and V-signs, but it is Norway who enter the Ullevaal Stadium tonight in need of \"a miracle\", according to the Fulham defender and Arsenal target Brede Hangeland. His admission should lend perspective to Scotland's position. Bottom of Group Nine with three points from five games, Norway's faint hopes of reaching South Africa will be extinguished should Scotland win and give Burley the finest result of his tenure thus far. It is a big ask of the visitors, especially given the ludicrous demands of playing a competitive World Cup fixture three days before the Premier Leagues resume either side of the border, but the incentive of strengthening their grip on second place is greater. \"The Champions League is very exciting and has so much money poured into it,\" said Darren Fletcher, a finalist for the past two seasons with Manchester United. \"But we are not here to get paid. We are here because we want to achieve something for our country. The World Cup is the pinnacle and we are desperate to be there.\" Fletcher will captain his country again in the absence of the injured Stephen McManus, having taken the armband in the last qualifier against Iceland while the disgraced Barry Ferguson flicked his international suicide from the substitutes' bench. Scotland appear more united without their former captain and Allan McGregor involved, as Burley insinuated with talk of being able to trust his developing squad, but that is all well and good on the training field. The test arrives when Norway's desperation for victory will be transferred into an early \u2013 and aerial \u2013 assault. In the depths of this campaign Norway chose to revisit their history by appointing the man who led them to the 1994 and 1998 World Cup finals, and to second place in the Fifa world rankings, following the resignation of Age Hareide. Egil Olsen, he of Wimbledon, wellington boots and route-one fame, is back at the helm and seeking to build on the encouraging 1-0 friendly defeat of Germany that announced his return to international football. The odds on claiming second place and a play-off berth from Scotland or Macedonia, however, are as long as the balls that will be projected towards the Caldwell brothers, Gary and Steven, in Oslo. \"Historically, Olsen has done great things for the Norwegian national team,\" said Hangeland. \"He performed miracles 15 or 20 years ago and we saw some of that when we played Germany away earlier this year. I hope he has a miracle left in him. This is more or less our last chance to do something about our qualification hopes.\" John Carew was a potent threat in the goalless draw at Hampden Park last November. That game is remembered more for Chris Iwelumo's astonishing miss than the ease with which the Aston Villa striker escaped Scotland's defenders, and Fletcher envisages a physical struggle at the Ullevaal. \"Their style will be very direct,\" he added. \"Norway are not going through their best period just now, but they will be desperate to get a win. I am really surprised to see them at the bottom. They are better than that, and they will be looking to put that right, starting with us. We won't be all-out attack, we will be solid and hard to beat, and we'll have a game-plan.\" McManus, James Morrison, Gary Naysmith, Kirk Broadfoot and Iwelumo are all absent through injury tonight, although James McFadden is back in a Scotland squad for the first time since being substituted against Norway last year. The biggest miss, and therefore selection problem for Burley, is the goalkeeper Craig Gordon, with Neil Alexander of Rangers and Cardiff City's David Marshall vying for his role.
