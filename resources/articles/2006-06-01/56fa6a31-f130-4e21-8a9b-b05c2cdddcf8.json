I've used French beans, but baby asparagus is divine, as are very lightly-cooked mangetouts, in which case replace the basil with mint. Serve as a side dish, or turn it into a complete light meal by serving with some soft, creamy cheese or hummus. Serves four. 500g new potatoes, washed 250g French beans, topped and tailed 225g cherry tomatoes, halved 4 tbsp basil leaves, roughly torn For the dressing 1 tsp Dijon mustard \u00bd garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp red-wine or cider vinegar 3 tbsp olive oil Salt and pepper Halve or quarter the potatoes, making sure they're all roughly the same size. Put into a pan, pour in enough water just to cover and bring up to the boil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until almost tender, then add the beans, bring back to the boil, and cook for a further four to six minutes, until the beans and potatoes are tender but still a bit crunchy (or as you like them). Drain, put into a bowl and mix with the tomatoes. Now make the dressing: whisk together the mustard, garlic, vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Tip into the salad bowl, along with the basil, and toss well (your hands are the best tool for this), so everything is glossy with dressing. Check the seasoning, then heap on to plates or a serving dish. Serve while it's still warm (though it's also good cold)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
