Some might say a laissez-faire attitude was precisely what got Eriksson into trouble with England, although the Manchester City defender said he respects the fact that the coach knows he is in charge of an experienced team. \"We players have known each other for a long time, we all grew up in the same academy,\" Tour\u00e9 said. \"To be together and play together is like playing with your brother. Mr Eriksson lets the group do what we want and that is most important. We like him as well because he is a really humble man.\" \u2022 Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter \u2022 Sign up to play our great Fantasy Football game \u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player \u2022 The latest team-by-team news, features and more Tour\u00e9 felt the point gained in the opening game against Portugal was an encouraging one. \"It was a good result for us, one point is not bad because Portugal are one of the best teams in the world,\" he said. \"We played very well as a team, that was most important. It is about the whole team, not just the defence. It is all about teamwork, really. To win the World Cup is not about one player, it is about a squad. I am really proud of all the players.\" Ivory Coast play Brazil next, and their captain is under no illusions. \"We will need to defend even better against Brazil but we have the chance in our hand. We will play a top, top team and Robinho is a top, top player, but if we fight like we did against Portugal, and have the luck to score a goal, it will be good. It will be difficult to handle Robinho but we are defending well and the team spirit is high. The manager has made a big difference. Having Didier Drogba back will be a big help too but when you see a fantastic young player like Gervinho playing the way he did it is encouraging. We have some really good young players like Salomon Kalou and Aruna Dindane.\" Drogba seems to be a hero to the whole of Africa, but Tour\u00e9 does not feel under any extra pressure as a result of being an African team at an African World Cup. \"There is no pressure for us, we know there are top countries in football who have lots of money to put into the team,\" he said. \"African countries we do not have those facilities but we can still fight. We are really proud of Ghana's win and hope next time be maybe Cameroon, maybe us, maybe another country.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
