On the other hand, the analysis by consultancy Deloitte Access Economics found policies consistent with a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and keeping global warming to 1.5C could expand the economy by 2.6%, or $680bn to the economy, and create 250,000 jobs. Deloitte focused on what it said was a fundamental flaw in how climate change is publicly considered \u2013 the idea that the costs of acting are weighed against an assumption the economy will keep growing if there are unconstrained emissions. Meanwhile, it said, the benefits of steps to tackle the issue were regularly downplayed. The report suggested Australia would experience an economic hit on par with Covid-19 every year by 2050 if the climate crisis was not addressed. It estimated more than 30% of employed Australians and 30% of national income were exposed to economic disruption and risk due to the climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, and would suffer in an unplanned economic transition. \u201cWhile this is a significant number of jobs and growth at risk \u2013 enough to drive recessions \u2013 it is not all doom and gloom,\u201d it said. \u201cThe good news is that the remaining 70% of the workforce and Australia\u2019s GDP is able to help create the change and a new economic trajectory for Australia in a post-Covid world.\u201d Chris Richardson, Deloitte Australia\u2019s chief economist, said the experience of Covid showed the cost of overlooking \u201ccatastrophic risks\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent wake-up call for us to get ahead of that other big risk: climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralians need policy and regulatory reform that modernises our economy and unleashes business investment. The benefits of acting are huge, but we are fast running out of opportunity.\u201d Richardson said the best way to tackle the climate crisis was through \u201cmarket mechanisms\u201d. The report recommended chasing \u201chigh-growth industries\u201d such as mining new minerals for new technologies, supporting innovation in advanced manufacturing and investing in upgrading and replacing infrastructure. It was the latest in a growing push from across the political spectrum, including significant parts of the business sector and the community, for the government to do far more to back a green recovery to set the economy up for an inevitable shift to zero emissions. Modelling from different sources has routinely found the cost of waiting would be greater than acting now. That finding has become more pronounced as the cost of renewable energy reduced substantially in recent years. Last month the International Energy Agency said solar was the cheapest form of energy in human history. Pradeep Philip, the report\u2019s lead author, said reaching net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 a target the Morrison government has rejected but that is backed by the European Union, Britain, Japan, South Korea, Canada and US presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2013 to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and certainly no greater than 2C, was an \u201ceconomic necessity\u201d. \u201cWhatever Australia does or doesn\u2019t do, the global warming which has already taken place will hurt our lives and livelihoods. This cost is locked in \u2013 it is the cost of delay,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a \u2018no-cost\u2019 option, so if we could take action today to prevent the next great recession from climate change, why wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Philip said there would be costs and some losers in a transition to net zero emissions, \u201cbut we\u2019ll all be losers if we fail to act\u201d. The report estimated reaching net zero emissions would reduce GDP by $90bn by 2050. It said about a quarter of this \u2013 $23bn \u2013 is unavoidable due to locked-in impacts of climate change, and the remaining $67bn is a small price to pay relative to the size of the economy. \u201cFor comparison, the current jobjeeper program is costing the federal budget just over $65bn this year alone \u2013 and this is the necessary price Australia is paying to minimise the worst economic consequences of Covid,\u201d it said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found emissions would need to reach net zero by about 2050 to limit global heating to 1.5C, considered necessary to limit the effects of climate change. But it said it would also require rapid action over the next decade: a 45% cut in global emissions compared with 2010 levels by 2030."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
