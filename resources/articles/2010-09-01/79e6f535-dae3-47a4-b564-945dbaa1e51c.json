That should have been England only, as the Welsh assembly controls education. \u2022 The phrase \"Catholic abuse\" should not have been used to describe what happened to victims of sexual and other forms of abuse within the Roman Catholic church, in a report of their demand that the pope hand over to the authorities all information on clergy accused of such acts (Victims call on pope to release abuse information, 16 September, page 6). \u2022 A commentary about the state of the Roman Catholic church referred to the reforms unleashed by Pope John XXIII's second Vatican council. This should have been dated to 1962, not 1969 (The Catholic church is in crisis, but it is still able to influence and inspire, 6 September, page 25). \u2022 Is donors' money being used in the best way by the Prince of Wales's charities, a leading article wondered. While praising the Prince's Trust for helping young people find work, the commentary pointed to possible financial trouble at a scheme to save Dumfries House in Scotland, where the Prince of Wales's charitable foundation is among the groups involved. The Prince's Trust has asked us to make clear that it is not a beneficiary of the Prince's Charities Foundation: \"Every pound donated to the Prince's Trust is spent by the Prince's Trust [which] is able to raise and manage its own funds\" (Uneasy lies the head, 11 September, page 30). \u2022\u2008\"In 2007, [BAE Systems] bought American military vehicle company Armor Holdings \u2026 maker of the Humvee,\" an article said. The maker of this military vehicle is Indiana-based AM General; Armor Holdings supplies some elements, including armour kits (BAE to offload US aerospace unit for $2bn, 13 September, page 25)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
