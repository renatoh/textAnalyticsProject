The RFU has traditionally been against ring-fencing the top flight but Brown conceded that as discussions continue over how the domestic structure fits in with the global calendar from 2020 onwards, its stance has changed somewhat. As revealed by the Guardian last week, reducing the Premiership to 10 teams is also among a host of suggestions previously made and Brown admitted it may take until the end of the season to reach a resolution, more than a year after Premiership Rugby Limited announced its intention to extend its season to 10 months, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no specific plan of action at this point\u201d. Brown also hinted that doing away with one or both of the A League and the Anglo-Welsh Cup may also be part of the solution. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all options, but there\u2019s no specific consideration of numbers [of teams in each league] at the moment, whether it\u2019s the first or second level, at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about number of teams in the league, it\u2019s also about the number of competitions played within the season. \u201cOur historic view would be the same, that promotion and relegation is the right thing. But going forward, the world is changing rapidly, the dynamics are changing [and] we\u2019re trying to fit the season together. If it has to change, for the benefit of the game overall, why would we close our mind to it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
