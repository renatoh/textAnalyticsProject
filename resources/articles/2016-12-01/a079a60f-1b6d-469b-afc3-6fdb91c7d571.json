He made his feelings on the subject clear when speaking to reporters about this Thursday\u2019s home game against the LA Rams. \u201c[Thursday Night Football] is a poopfest. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d Sherman said on Tuesday. \u201cWe got home like 1 o\u2019clock in the morning, something like that on Monday and then you\u2019ve got to play again. Congratulations, NFL, you did it again. But they\u2019ve been doing it all season, so I guess we\u2019re the last ones to get the middle finger.\u201d He added that players are only \u201c50, 60%\u201d recovered by the time games come round if they are playing on a Thursday night, adding strain to tired bodies in a league that is notoriously punishing. Sherman has been critical of the effects of Thursday Night Football in the past. Last year he said it was hypocritical for the NFL to send out players on short rest and yet still claim it cares about safety. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s rough,\u201d Sherman said in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s rough on the body. Any time you play a football game and play another one a few days later, it\u2019s going to be tough on the body. But it\u2019s just another one of those things. Another one of those simple contradictions of the league, because they care about us.\u201d Thursday Night Football has been criticized by others too, from uninspiring match-ups to problems with the color run uniforms. This Thursday\u2019s game could have an impact on the playoffs \u2013 they are huge favorites to win the NFC West but are still chasing home advantage in the post-season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
