The Wolves captain also believes that Murphy either \"nutted or elbowed\" him in an incident that went unpunished at the end of the first half of a fractious encounter on Saturday. Wolves were upset with the Fulham captain after he spoke out in the wake of Henry breaking Bobby Zamora's leg at Craven Cottage in September. A month later Murphy suggested that Wolves were one of three clubs whose players are sent out \"so pumped up, there is inevitably going to be problems\". The remarks went down badly at Molineux, and Henry believes that Wolves, who remain in the bottom three, have been victimised ever since. \"We had seven yellow cards [at Craven Cottage] and everything that has happened after that has not helped our season,\" said Henry. \"Murphy's comments have changed the public perception of us and maybe the referees' perception of us, too. It's taken us a long time to lose that tag. [But] it's been dragged up again today because we were playing Fulham. \"We thought we had lost that tag a long time before we played Newcastle away [at the start of the month]. [But] it seems the referee up there had it in his mind straight away that he was going to book us. The advice was to not do anything silly and not pick up any silly yellow cards. We picked [them] up anyway. The referee identified that we were targeting Joey Barton. That was a load of rubbish. That flatters Joey Barton a ridiculous amount because we don't even talk about him in our team talks.\" Asked whether Murphy said anything to him on Saturday, Henry replied: \"Not really, there was nothing much said on the pitch. I think he's just a bit of a big mouth. He doesn't really want to say much on it. He just says it off it.\" There was, however, an incident before the interval, when Henry got up from the floor holding his face after Murphy clashed with him. \"He came in and nutted me or elbowed me. I'm not quite sure what it was,\" said Henry. \"The referee [Michael Oliver] was two yards away and didn't quite see it. That's how it goes.\" The referee certainly had a decent view of Richard Stearman's reckless lunge on Eidur Gudjohnsen but opted for a yellow card when it could easily have been red. Mark Hughes was not so fortunate. The Fulham manager felt that Brede Hangeland was unfairly cautioned for a tackle from behind on Steven Fletcher, who put Wolves in the lead before Andrew Johnson equalised within seconds of coming off the bench. Unable to contain his anger at the referee's decision, Hughes took three kicks at a water bottle in his technical area and was promptly sent to the stands. \"I got sent off for attacking a medical bag once but this time it was for abusing a water bottle and aggression in the technical area,\" Hughes said. \"It's a new one on me, and I did go in and ask the referee for clarification. I hadn't been warned before and I thought he could have come over for a quiet word. I didn't even kick [the water bottle] properly \u2013 my trousers were too tight and I couldn't take a proper swing at it \u2013 that's why I miscued it twice. Perhaps I should have flicked it up and volleyed it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
