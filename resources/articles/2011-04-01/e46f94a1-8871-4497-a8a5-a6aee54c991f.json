They were relegated last year but reinstated after Sporting Fingal folded.\" Plenty of teams have felt the noose of relegation tighten around their necks, only for the trapdoor not to open. The main area for this kind of (usually temporary) reprieve is the notoriously well-governed and financially stable world of the English non-league pyramid. As Darren Tickle points out, Leigh Genesis (n\u00e9 RMI) have been given second chances on a couple of occasions. In 2003-04 they finished second-bottom of the Conference but escaped the drop thanks to \"the lack of a promotable Northern Premier League club and the fact that Margate were demoted from the Conference for failing to meet ground standards\". In 2004-05 there was no get out and down they went after finishing rock bottom. In 2005-06, Leigh again escaped the drop despite finishing in the relegation places, because of Canvey Island's resignation from the league above. In 2006-07 they just about stayed up before being relegated in 2007-08. And again in 2008-09. And again this season \u2013 next year Genesis start life in the KoolSport Northern Counties East Football League Premier Division, the ninth tier of English football. Weston-super-Mare FC can go slightly better, having been let off the hook three times in four years. In 2006-07, having finished 21st of 22, they were saved by the liquidation of Farnborough Town and the merger of Hayes and Yeading. In 2007-08, after finishing 20th, 14th-placed Cambridge City came to the rescue after their ground failed to meet league standards. And in 2009-10 Salisbury City's double-relegation from the Conference meant the Seagulls stayed up once more. The Conference South is clearly quite a difficult one to get relegated from \u2013 in fact in the past four years only five teams have been relegated due to their league position. The undisputed Houdinis of English football, though, are Altrincham \u2013 the Robins were relegated, but not relegated, from the Conference for three successive seasons between 2005 and 2008. By now the story should be familiar \u2013 problems at Canvey Island and Scarborough came to the rescue in 2005-06, Boston United did likewise in 2006-07 and the liquidation of Halifax Town in 2007-08 made it a hat-trick of unlikely escapes. \"We're in another relegation scrap this year,\" writes Altincham fan Sam Tomlinson, \"but the feeling of invincibility settles the nerves.\" This piece from When Saturday Comes explains why the Robins may get another reprieve. In Scotland Airdrie United have also suffered back-to-back relegations from the same league \u2013 in 2008-09 Livingston's financial problems meant they stayed up, only to go down in 2009-10, while Drogheda's League of Ireland rivals Bray Wanderers can claim to have been relegated twice in a fortnight. \"In 2009 Bray finished bottom of the Premier Division and were relegated,\" writes Sean DeLoughry. \"However, immediately after the end of the season Derry City were expelled from the league for financial irregularities, so Bray were temporarily pardoned and entered the promotion-relegation playoffs. After defeats by Patrick's own Drogheda and Sporting Fingal Bray were relegated for the second time in a fortnight \u2026 however Cork City folded just before the start of the 2010 season so Bray were invited back into the Premier Division.\" THE MOST EGALITARIAN TEAM OF THE YEAR \"Predictably the Premier League PFA Team of the Year includes players from just five teams,\" writes Malcolm Beech. \"Has a PFA Team of the Year ever included players from 11 different sides?\" Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester City may dominate the PFA team this year, but even in the less top-heavy days of the 1970s and 80s the widest spread in the top-flight's team of the year was the nine teams represented in 1981-82: Peter Shilton (Nottingham Forest), Kenny Swain (Aston Villa), David O'Leary (Arsenal), Alan Hansen (Liverpool), Kenny Sansom (Arsenal), Graeme Souness (Liverpool), Glenn Hoddle (Tottenham Hotspur), Bryan Robson (Manchester United), Trevor Francis (Manchester City), Kevin Keegan (Southampton), Cyrille Regis (West Bromwich Albion) And even further down the leagues, the PFA's team of the year has never been comprised of players from 11 teams, although one season 10 teams were represented. In the old Division Three in 1988-89 the team of the year comprised of: Nigel Martyn (Bristol Rovers), Phil Brown (Bolton Wanderers), Dean Yates (Notts County), Rob Newman (Bristol City), Chris Coleman (Swansea City), Ray Walker (Port Vale), Brian Mooney (Preston North End), Sammy McIlroy (Bury), Steve Bull (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Andy Mutch (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Tony Agana (Sheffield United) UP AND UP \"All three sides who were promoted to the Championship are currently in the top six with only four games left,\" notes Max Bell. \"I was wondering if there had recently been any other seasons where such success had been found by all a division's promoted teams?\" Our best efforts take us another delve into the lower leagues, specifically the Southern Division One South and West (now the Zamaretto League Division One South and West \u2013 the eighth tier of English football) in 2008-09. Three of the promoted sides finished in the top four \u2013 Truro City (1st), AFC Totton (3rd) and Beaconsfield (4th) \u2013 while North Leigh ended up 8th. The full league table can be found here.

KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Whatever happened to Sonny Pike?\" asked Dan Williamson in 2006. \"I'm certain that years ago I watched a documentary about him and learned that he was England's brightest-ever prospect. I am also sure that he trained with the Ajax youth side.\" Sonny \u2013 the nephew of ex-Tottenham striker Mark Falco \u2013 became semi-famous after was invited to join Ajax's Academy of Excellence at the age of seven. Sadly, as this website explains, his dreams of a professional career ended a couple of years ago. \"Sonny is currently living near Dundee, and is studying psychology at Dundee University. He found the pressures of top-class football too much, and in 2003 decided to pursue a more regular career \u2013 having been privy to sports psychologists, he decided to follow that path. Nonetheless, he still has a fervent passion for the game, playing Sunday league football for Dryburgh Saints, as well as weekly five-a-side fixtures against other students.\" \"He is currently training for a Scottish FA coaching certificate, and as part of this, he coaches two primary school teams in the area. Although he doesn't support a local team, he goes to matches regularly, purely for his love of the game. Sonny says that he's much happier away from professional football. The pressure placed on him by his club, agents, sponsors and, to a lesser extent, the media made him suffer a nervous breakdown in October 2000, whilst still part of the Ajax youth squad.\" \"I couldn't take it, and I got ill, really screwed up,\" Sonny adds. \"I stopped going to training and stuff, because I was so screwed up I couldn't hack it. Looking back, it's amazing how low I was. Ajax completely forgot about me, they didn't want to know, but as soon as I was better, they acted like they'd always been there for me. I realised how superficial it is at that level, and if I hadn't got back to form I bet they would have turfed me out. That's why I packed it in, it's so unstable. I guess it was during that period that I realised how much psychologists can help people, and I suppose I took it from there.\" For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? \"Stephen Hunt's last two Premier League seasons with Reading and Hull have ended in relegation,\" notes Alex Hynes. \"He is now in danger again at Wolves, so he could be relegated in three successive seasons for three different clubs. Has this ever happened before?\" \"With the threat of demolition of their Church Road ground, rumours are that Conference National side Hayes and Yeading will be forced to play their home matches at Farnborough FC's Rushmoor Arena, a 28.4 mile walk from their old ground according to Google,\" writes Nick Dunkeyson. \"But who in the football pyramid currently plays the furthest from their nominal 'base' (ignoring the controversial Arsenal and MK Dons suggestions)?\" \"Last Saturday I was a linesman in the last Israeli Central District Under-18 League match of the season,\" begins Ravid Alon. \"Ironi Shoham had to win the match in order to win the championship and be promoted. Shoham were able to achieve this unremarkable feat, but in a very remarkable way. Just 30 seconds in the second half, Shoham conceded and fell 1-4 behind, but it wasn't enough to break the young lads' spirit: an 87th minute goal gave Shoham a 6-5 lead and the championship. This exciting finish got me thinking, what was the biggest comeback in the last match of the season of a professional league to capture the title?\" \"Is Dirk Kuyt's dramatic equalisier in the 102nd minute against Arsenal this weekend the latest goal scored in a regular league match?\" wonders Haris Odobasic.
