The couple we had just encountered in the pub were in their mid-30s and were enjoying the first evening of a long weekend hotel break in Glasgow. They were from Blackburn and their demeanour spoke of aspirational, working-class, comprehensive England. They could have been professional (cost accountants perhaps), but they could also have been skilled artisan. The gent may even have been wearing a tanktop. Afterwards, I remember hoping that they weren't teachers. They were pleasant and affable in that plain-speaking manner that has always attracted me to those who dwell in the Midlands and the north of England. It was only when we said that we would be visiting Blackburn the following week for a football pilgrimage that we first noticed a drop in the temperature. \"Is it a decent town centre with nice pubs and restaurants?\" I asked. \"The town centre is a no-go area now, it's been taken over by Asians. We all moved out years ago.\" This from the woman as her partner nodded vigorously. Were the candles on the table beginning to flicker? Had the barman suddenly called time on the happy hour it could not have become chillier. We blundered on. We asked them why that was necessarily a problem. After all, weren't we in Glasgow proud of the way in which the Asians, the Chinese, the eastern Europeans, the Italians and the Irish had all contributed to our city becoming one of the most interesting and diverse cities in Europe? But the couple were having none of it. \"It's not our city any more and we have been abandoned by the Labour party.\" It was the BNP's manifesto in one short sentence and helped to explain why they would soon make their first UK electoral gains on the councils of north-west England. When Gordon Brown encountered his Rochdale nemesis, the couple emerged in front of me. At the same time, it became evident once more why this has seemed such an exclusively English election. The outrage of middle England, echoed by its hysterical tribunes in the London press, would have drowned a banshee's cry. The prime minister had privately voiced his disapproval of what he considered to be an unpleasant view expressed by a voter. It was hardly toxic, yet the baying for his blood left you wondering if he had called for the Falklands to be returned to the dastardly Argies. There has been hardly any reaction in Scotland to Brown's unguarded moment, save perhaps for a quiet acknowledgement that he was spot on. In a newspaper poll conducted the day after Brown's Rochdale moment and his subsequent appearance in the last of the prime ministerial debates, there was overwhelming personal approval for him. His mastery of Nick Clegg and David Cameron on stabilising the economy was utter and absolute and this had not been missed by the Scottish respondents. In England, meanwhile, Clegg and Cameron were still scoring well. Race issues play differently in Scotland. For more than a century, there has been a constant influx of foreign peoples and those who would seek refuge from economic or political privation. It started with the Irish fleeing their potato blight in the middle of the 19th century, to be followed by Italians en route for America who decided to bide here awhile and transform our catering landscape. The Indians followed and were soon joined by Pakistanis and Chinese. Recently, eastern European immigration, especially Poles and Albanians, have bolstered the nation's ability to provide crucial, if indifferently paid services to its people in every sector of employment. Scotland is not sparsely populated but nor is it overcrowded. There is more than enough space for them all. In many of our most deprived areas, there has emerged a class who have become indolent unto the third generation. Few of them can name a family member who has ever taken in a monthly wage with tax and national insurance. Scotland's white and idle poor no longer have the stomach for those jobs that are being taken by enthusiastic Africans, Poles and Romanians. There are reasons why poor, white Scots no longer possess a work instinct and it has nothing to do with race, but everything to do with crime, poverty and education. Labour will be returned overwhelmingly in Scotland, just as they were in 2005. They remain the only party still emotionally and spiritually committed to the idea of addressing deprivation and its causes and bringing about a more just society. The SNP will be pushed into third by the Lib Dems and well short of their stated aim of securing 20 Westminster seats. But this is a phoney poll for them. In Scotland, the Lib Dems will remain the political nonentity they have always been. The Scottish Tories have never more obviously looked like a mere satellite of the Oxford drinking clubs that run the UK party. As such, they may be grateful to finish with one seat, which is more than they deserve. Gordon Brown's instincts in Rochdale last week did not betray him. In Scotland, they echoed many of ours \u2013 a love of diversity and a preferential option for those fleeing persecution. The prime minister's Presbyterianism is rooted in the truth that, before God, all men are created equal. He has no need to apologise for this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
