The Dow held onto its earlier gains, closing 554 points higher at 27,480 - a gain of just over 2%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index also ended in the green, up 1.8% or 58 points at 3,369. The tech-focused Nasdaq also jumped 1.8%, up nearly 203 points at 11,160. So, that\u2019s two days of solid gains on the New York stock market, in the run-up to a most eagerly awaited election results. As Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG, puts it: \u201cThe markets in the last 48 hours have become a bit more convinced of a Biden victory without the messy risk of weeks of uncertainty and turmoil.\u201d By tomorrow, we may know whether they were right.... In the meantime, keep tracking events here. GW Time for a recap.... Global stock markets have rallied as investors await the results of the US presidential election. Equities have jumped in New York, following a strong day\u2019s trading in Europe and gains in Asia-Pacific markets. In London, the FTSE 100 rose by 2.3% in its biggest one-day rally in two months with banks and housebuilders having a strong day. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 1.9% or 520 points in a broad-based rally. The dollar has weakened, pushing the pound up by a cent to $1.3020 tonight. The possibility of a Blue Wave, in which the Democrats win control of the Senate as well as the White House, has also pushed up US Treasury bond yields to their highest levels since June. That shows some investors are calculating that a multi-trillion dollar stimulus package could be pushed through next year, leading to higher borrowing, stronger growth, and more inflation. But analysts are also cautioning that the election could throw up a surprise, with a record-breaking number of votes cast even before today\u2019s polls opened. And, as the Financial Times points out, Wednesday could be rather volatile..... Wall Street\u2019s Vix index, one of the most closely watched measures of expected US equities volatility, traded at 36 on Tuesday, almost double its long-term average. A similar measure called the Move index that tracks expectations for Treasuries tumult was also elevated. Investors had a \u201chealthy degree of nervousness\u201d about the prospect of a disputed election result, said Paul Leech, co-head of global equities at Barclays. \u201cIf we do get a contested outcome, then uncertainty is the worst thing for markets,\u201d said Tihana Ibrahimpasic, a multi-asset analyst at fund manager Janus Henderson, predicting a rush to haven assets in that scenario that would push Treasury yields lower. You can keep track of all the latest election developments here: It\u2019s lunchtime in New York, where the stock market is holding onto its earlier election day gains. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are all up around 2% today, with financial stocks, industrial companies, consumer cyclicals and technology shares leading the rally. US Treasury bond yields are also continuing to climb, as investors anticipate a large fiscal stimulus package -- meaning higher borrowing. Eric Vanraes, portfolio manager at Eric Sturdza Investments, points out that the election is not a \u2018done deal\u2019.... Biden is supposed to win but it\u2019s not a done deal. And there are many uncertainties around the outcome for the Senate. If Trump wins (still possible), it means bullish equity markets and corporate bonds. Treasury yields and the slope of the curve would be more or less unchanged If Biden wins (the most likely scenario but\u2026), it would mean initially a steeper US Treasury curve and higher long term yields (less if GOP win the Senate, more if Dems win the Senate). China\u2019s leaders have also given the markets a boost today, says Guardian economics writer Phillip Inman. While the Shanghai stock exchange jolted investors by halting the Ant Group\u2019s $37bn listing, China\u2019s communist party leadership said they would step up \u201ccounter-cyclical adjustments to the macro economy\u201d, which is another way of saying they will pump extra funds into the economy to protect firms and households during a rocky time for global trade. Striking a more expansionist tone than in recent months, party officials were also reported to be seeking the more widespread use of China\u2019s currency \u2013 the yuan \u2013 and safeguarding Chinese companies\u2019 legal interests overseas. While the yuan is traded in London and other markets, its adoption as a currency alongside the dollar, the euro and the pound has been slow. The official Xinhua News Agency said communist party officials, in a series of recommendations for economic and social development over the next five years, would step up research efforts to develop a sovereign digital currency, which most western countries have put in the back burner this year while the tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Emphasising the hard-won nature of China\u2019s economic success, president Xi Jinping was quoted as saying that Beijing was aware the country faces a significant increase in risks, including unpredictable risks, from health issues and the introspection affecting many countries, some of which \u201chave adopted unilateralism and protectionism\u201d. To emphasise the party\u2019s commitment to driving economic growth, he said China will declare in the first half of 2021 that it has achieved the goal of turning the country into a moderately prosperous society. David Madden, CMC Markets analyst, says the US election has helped investors look beyond the Covid-19 crisis: Equity markets are enjoying a very bullish move today as the US presidential election has taken centre stage, and for now it has eclipsed the health crisis and the restrictions. Stocks are building on yesterday\u2019s gains as an absence of negative news has assisted the mood. The non-stop headlines about the battle for the White House has acted as a nice distraction from what is going on in terms of tighter restrictions. Stocks enjoyed a very positive move yesterday and that sentiment has been carried into today. In London, it was a broad-based rally, as banking, house building, transport, travel, commodity and hospitality stocks are showing gains. Here\u2019s our news story on the dramatic suspension of Ant\u2019s record-breaking stock market float: Today\u2019s rally across European stock markets suggests optimism that the US election will deliver a clear result - with the polls signalling that Joe Biden is on course for victory. But, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx points out, investors could get a shock overnight: You would think the result of Tuesday\u2019s Presidential election \u2013 one that carries so much more weight than usual given the nature of the incumbent and the state of the global economy \u2013 is a forgone conclusion based on the actions of investors. Anticipating a blue wave, the markets went all in on a green tsunami, the boards a luscious shade of emerald as the Western indices continued to aggressively rebound from their nightmarish end to October. That they fell so fast and hard last week is undoubtedly a contributing factor to the size of Tuesday\u2019s gains. But the main thrust of trading is based on the assumption that Joe Biden is headed for victory \u2013 2016 shocks, mail-in vote delays, and nefarious Republicans bedamned! The danger for the markets \u2013 and it is a very real danger \u2013 is that they are going to wake-up with a HELL of a hangover on Wednesday if the result is anything but a decisive, and stimulus-signalling, victory for the Democrats. All the major European markets have rallied strongly, in a burst of risk-on trading. This has lifted the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index up by over 2.2%, away from last week\u2019s five-month lows. German DAX: up 300 points or 2.55% at 12,088 French CAC: up 114 points or 2.4% at 4,805 Italian FTSE MIB: up 586 points or 3.1% at 18,986 Spanish IBEX: up 166 points or 2.5% at 6,751 Newsflash: The London stock market has just posted its strongest one-day rally in almost two months. At the close of trading, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index is 131 points higher at 5,786 - a one-week high. That\u2019s a rise of 2.33%, the best one-day gain since 7th September, as investors brace for the results of the US election to come in overnight. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce ended the day as the top riser, up 9.7%, followed by banking stocks with NatWest up 7% and Barclays gaining 5.9%. Nearly every share rose, amid much City chatter about the possibility of a Biden victory and a potential Blue Wave sweeping across Congress. The US bond market is still signalling that investors are anticipating a swift deal on a major new economic stimulus package. As flagged earlier, bond yields are at four-month highs today. That indicates traders are pricing in more fiscal spending (meaning more borrowing, and more inflation). Reuters has the latest details: U.S. Treasury yields marched higher on Tuesday as the market braced for potential volatility on Election Day due to uncertainty over the results. Americans headed to the polls to decide whether incumbent Republican President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden will be elected president. The benchmark 10-year yield, which earlier rose to 0.887%, its highest level since June, was last up 3.6 basis points at 0.884%. Yields on two- and five-year notes also reached multi-month highs earlier in the session. Bill Merz, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, pointed to the potential for \u201ca significant amount of volatility\u201d in the market as some traders have positioned for Democrats to win the White House and control of Congress in the election. \u201cIn that scenario of a blue sweep, there is an expectation of a larger fiscal package and that would indicate additional supply as well as boost the prospects for reflationary pressures to reemerge,\u201d he said. After an hour\u2019s trading in New York, US stocks are continuing to rally. The Dow is now up 594 points, or 2.2% at 27,519 -- its highest level in a week. The S&amp;P 500 is up 2%, with the Nasdaq 1.8% higher. With an hour\u2019s trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 index is still showing strong gains. It\u2019s still up 2% or 117 points at 5772, a one-week high, and its best day since early September. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Share prices in the City are on course for their biggest daily gain in two months amid investor hopes that a Joe Biden victory in the US presidential election would result in a major new stimulus package. Despite the imminent start of a new nationwide lockdown in England on Thursday, financial markets believe Biden will defeat Donald Trump as part of a Democrat clean sweep of the presidency and both houses of Congress. The City is also expecting the Bank of England to support activity with an announcement on Thursday of at least \u00a3100bn of fresh money creation through its quantitative easing programme.... The UK pound is climbing higher against the US dollar. Sterling is now up nearly 1.5 cents at $1.3056, while the euro has gained 0.8 of a cent to $1.172. This continues to indicate that investors are expecting a decisive election result, clearing the way for a multi-trillion dollar stimulus package. John J Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, says the market appears to be moving in favour of a Blue Wave scenario. The market seems to be putting on the reflationary trade today ahead of the uncertainties of the U.S. election as the US Dollar and Japanese yen wilt.... Any strong turnout among Democrats could support an extension of this development, while a contested election scenario would very likely do the opposite. Economic data takes a back seat when there\u2019s an election. But we should note that US factory orders rose in September, a little faster than expected, but not as rapidly as immediately after the spring shutdown ended. Factory orders rose by 1.1% during the month, up from 0.5% in August, partly due to strong demand for transportation equipment (cars, boats, planes..). However.... Alibaba is certainly not rallying. Shares in Alibaba are down 9% after its planned $37bn flotation of payments arm Ant was dramatically suspended by regulators a couple of hours ago. Banks are leading Wall Street higher in early trading, with JP Morgan jumping 2.7% and Goldman Sachs up 2.1%. Consumer-focused stocks are also on the rise, with Coca-Cola gaining 1.7%, Walt Disney rising by 1.3% and Walmart up 1.2%. Every stock on the Dow Jones is up, although tech stocks are lagging behind (Apple is up 0.4%) The US stock market is open...and stocks are moving higher as investors position themselves for the results of today\u2019s election. The Dow Jones industrial average: up 317 points or 1.1% at 27,242 The S&amp;P 500: up 31.1 points or 0.9% at 3,341 Nasdaq: up 59 points or 0.55% at 11,017 That lifts Wall Street towards a one-week high. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe reckons optimistic investors are bargain hunting after recent losses, rather than scarpering nervously to the sidelines. But that could be a mistake, if the election result is contested. Erlam writes: So why the positivity when there\u2019s so much event risk this week, including potentially the most controversial Presidential election in decades. Well, I think trading over the last few weeks has a lot to do with it. The Dow fell 6% last week and the two the preceded it weren\u2019t particularly good either. It seems the positioning ahead of the election has already been very risk averse, heavily aided by Covid lockdowns. So perhaps some investors are sensing opportunity ahead of the polls closing. Naturally it helps when one candidate has a hefty lead in the polls which reduces the possibility that the result will be contested. This could bring considerable uncertainty in the coming weeks, and at the worst possible time. The polls certainly seem to indicate that the race for the White House is almost a foregone conclusion. But if I\u2019ve learned anything about Trump, it\u2019s that he won\u2019t take defeat lightly and he can\u2019t be counted out. I fear it may not be as straightforward as the markets seem to suggest. Back in New York, investors are still anticipating a solid start to election day trading. US. stock futures are sharply higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pointed up 384 points (+1.4%). Analyst Tom Essaye of The Sevens Report warns that the rally would unwind if election doesn\u2019t provide a clear result. \u201cUltimately, the markets want clarity, and the main threat to risk assets this week is the emergence of a contested election, so if races are tight enough for campaigns to sue to halt or extend recounts, expect a reversal of this morning\u2019s rally,\u201d Over in Shanghai, the stock market flotation of financial/technology group Ant Group has been dramatically put on hold. Stock market bosses have squashed Ant\u2019s plans to float shares in Shanghai on Thursday, in what was due to be the biggest IPO ever. The move comes a day after top officials interviewed founder Jack Ma, amid concerns over the regulation of the company. In a statement, the Shanghai stock exchange said the listing was suspended, due to issues including changes in \u201cthe financial technology regulatory environment\u201d. \u201cThis material event may cause your company to fail to meet the issuance and listing conditions or information disclosure requirements. Our exchange has decided to postpone the listing of your company.\u201d Ant is a spinoff from e-commerce giant Alibaba. It handled the group\u2019s payments processing, and has now built an empire connecting China\u2019s borrowers and lenders. It also offers a range of financial services products, including insurance and wealth management. Ma has insisted that Ant is a tech company, not a financial one. That would mean a higher valuation, while avoiding rules on capital and leverage designed to keep banks in check. Ant had been planning a $37bn IPO on Thursday, with shares sold in Hong Kong and Shanghai, but the sales is now paused. In New York, stock market traders are preparing for a tense Election Day\u2019s trading as Americans heads to the polls. The Dow Jones industrial average is set for a strong start; now up over 400 points in the futures markets, or 1.5%. That follows today\u2019s gains in Europe and Asia-Pacific markets, on top of the Dow\u2019s 423-point rally on Monday. Stephen Innes, Chief Global Markets Strategist at Axi, says there is \u201ca festive \u2018risk-on\u201d mood\u2019\u201d in some markets, with traders anticipating a potential Blue wave. I think if a US election result is declared this week, with an orderly concession from the defeated candidate, and since the markets are sufficiently oversold into the event, look for the election relief rally to extend. Of course, the rally\u2019 construct will differ depending on who wins the presidency and what party controls the Senate/House. Commodity prices are also rallying today, with aluminium hitting an 18-month high. Reuters reckons it\u2019s another sign that the markets are expecting a good night for the Democrats, paving the way for a growth-boosting stimulus package. Industrial metals rose alongside stock markets and oil prices on Tuesday as investors bet on Joe Biden to win the U.S. presidency, with strong manufacturing data and signs of tighter supply pushing aluminium to an 18-month high. A Democratic sweep of Tuesday\u2019s U.S. election could pave the way for increased government stimulus. The dollar also weakened, helping metals by making them cheaper for non-U.S. buyers. Benchmark three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 1.3% at $1,890.50 a tonne by 1220 GMT after hitting its highest since May 2019 at $1,892. Prices could retreat as new coronavirus resrictions slow economic growth in Europe and elsewhere, said Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree. European equities are continuing to climb, with the main indices still at one-week highs after this morning\u2019s trading. UK\u2019s FTSE 100: up 112 points or 2% at 5,767 German DAX: up 218 points or 1.8% at 12,007 French CAC: up 95 points or 2% at 4,787 Property companies, banks and miners are still leading the FTSE risers. Investors seem to be coming to terms with the new European Covid-19 lockdowns, which are expected to shrink the UK and eurozone economies this quarter. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says Australia\u2019s interest rate cut is also boosting markets -- but cautions against getting too excited. \u201cEuropean stock markets have rallied hard in early trading this morning, seemingly glad just to see voting underway in the US. \u201cIt looks like markets have decided to remain calm about the US presidential election, as European stocks move sharply higher in early trading. \u201cThe RBA\u2019s decision to cut rates and boost QE is just the kind of central bank action that investors like to see, with the hope that more might be forthcoming later in the week from the Bank of England giving a further boost to bullish sentiment. \u201cThe risk is that investors are getting ahead of themselves, given the potential for a long, drawn-out battle over the result of the US election in coming weeks should no obvious result appear by this time tomorrow morning.\u201d In that case risk assets could well struggle to make much headway, even if they do manage to avoid further substantial losses similar to what we saw last week. \u201cThe focus on the election obscures the really important element, namely a US fiscal stimulus, since whoever emerges as the winner will need to sort out this most pressing item, before the US economy moves into an even deeper slump. With stocks up strongly, Treasury yields rising, and the US dollar down, the market may already priced in a Democrat clean sweep. So argues Neil Wilson of Markets.com, who also predicts volatility as election results roll in. The mentality right now is to buy the dip ahead of the election. Is this greater confidence about a Biden win, or simply a bit of buying on oversold conditions from last week\u2019s decline? It\u2019s hard to really say \u2013 the election looms and we are expecting volatility as results come through later. Certainly a clean result on the night is what markets are hoping for \u2013 whether it\u2019s Biden (higher yields, Value positive) or Trump. Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 rallied over 1.2% to reclaim its 100-day simple moving average at 3310 by the close. Value sectors prospered and led tech, perhaps on expectations of a Biden triumph leading to stimulus and infrastructure spending. The yield, or interest rate, on US government debt has risen this morning. The 10-year Treasury yield nudged 0.88% at one stage, slightly over last Friday\u2019s four-month high. Yields move inversely to bond prices, so this indicates that investors are selling Treasuries in favour of riskier assets such as equities. Treasury yields have been rising slowly but steadily since August, having plunged when the Covid-19 pandemic began as investors piled into the safety of US debt. The FT wrote last week that the recent selloff was partly due to hopes of a huge stimulus package, which could be inflationary. The shift out of Treasuries in recent weeks has been fuelled by the rising prospect of a so-called \u201cblue wave\u201d at next week\u2019s US election, a scenario where the Democratic party wins the presidency and both houses of Congress. Some investors have placed bets that the bigger fiscal stimulus expected under a Biden administration would mean a stronger recovery, pushing up inflation expectations \u2014 and forcing bond yields higher. More here: Treasury sell-off reignites question: how high can yields go? But still, yields are very low by historic standards - and the economic damage caused by the pandemic means its hard to see inflation rising too quickly, let alone the Federal Reserve raising interest rates or withdrawing its stimulus measures. A Biden victory could push the pound higher against the US dollar, if the Democrats also win the Senate, argues Jeremy Thomson Cook, chief economist at Equals Money: \u201cIn brief, a \u2018blue wave\u2019 result - which would see Joe Biden and the Democrats win the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives \u2013 is likely to have a negative impact on the strength of the US dollar, but a positive one on the pound, at least in the short-term. \u201cIf we see a gridlock result - which would see Biden winning the White House, Democrats winning the House of Representatives, and Republicans retaining the senate - it\u2019s likely the US dollar would strengthen. Similarly, if Trump is re-elected and retains his place in the White House, the US dollar is likely to rise higher, while the pound would fall.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018blue wave\u2019 is what most pollsters and analysts have pointed towards, but of course nothing is certain, and uncertainty is one of the biggest causes of volatility for currency.\u201d The US dollar has weakened against other major currencies today. The greenback has lost three quarters of a cent against the pound, pushing sterling up to $1.2990. The euro has also climbed around half a cent, to nearly $1.17. The US dollar is a classic safe-haven asset when investors get the jitters, so this is another sign of growing confidence about the US election. It also suggests a Blue Wave may be being priced in, as a multi-trillion dollar stimulus package would likely be currency negative. Raffi Boyadjian of XM says: The US dollar was under selling pressure on Tuesday as risk aversion subsided, with its index pulling away from yesterday\u2019s one-month high. Most final polls ahead of the election put Democratic candidate Joe Biden with around an eight-point lead over incumbent President Trump. Biden also appears to hold a narrow lead in enough swing states that would secure him the presidency. Although it\u2019s more than possible that Trump\u2019s energetic mass rallies in recent days where thousands of supporters have turned up might just tip the balance in his favour, the fact that almost 100 million Americans have already cast their vote means a late surge for Republicans might come too late. However, the biggest worry for investors isn\u2019t who will be the next occupant of the White House but the prospect of a tight finish where the final result won\u2019t be known for weeks. Trump has reportedly threatened to legally challenge the results in some battleground states and a prolonged legal fight is the worst outcome for the markets right now as it would cause political gridlock and delay any agreement on a new fiscal stimulus bill. Mind you, a Reuters poll found that investors expect some dollar weakness regardless of who wins the election, with US interest rates at record lows and unlikely to rise for quite some time. Back in London, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is on track for its best day in almost two months as the rally continues. The blue-chip index of leading UK and multinational companies is now up 104 points, or 1.8%, at 5757 points - a one-week high. This would be its largest one-day move since 7th September, just before the second wave of Covid-19 cases began hitting the UK. Housebuilders, miners and banks continue to lead the charge, with virtually every stock higher. This continues to indicate optimism that the election will deliver a clear result. Strategist Jussi Hiljanen of Nordic bank SEB, argues that a Democratic blue sweep would be positive for shares, and result in a large scale fiscal stimulus: \u201cA clear election result would eliminate one of the three current major market concerns: the surging pandemic, election uncertainties and prospects for new fiscal stimulus. A fast and uncontested election result would be positive for stock markets and negative for the dollar and bonds irrespective of who wins. A blue sweep with Joe Biden winning the presidency and Democrats gaining control of the Senate (and keeping control of the House) would provide least resistance to a large-scale fiscal stimulus, which would be more positive for stocks and negative for bonds and the dollar. But a divided Congress would make a fiscal stimulus deal more difficult (as has been proven in recent months). The worst-case scenario for markets would be an extended period of uncertainty resulting from the election being too close to call, leading to reprocessing of ballots and possibly contested election results with neither party admitting defeat. Such a scenario would be negative for risky assets and positive for the dollar and bond markets.\u201d US stocks are expected to rise when trading begins on Wall Street, in around four hours: Mohit Kumar of Jefferies reckons the battle for the Senate could be worth $2tn in potential stimulus measures: In terms of market impact, a clear result should be positive for risk sentiment, irrespective of a Biden or Trump win. From a fiscal stimulus perspective, as we have argued before, the Senate elections are as important, if not more, than a Presidential one. A \u2018Blue Wave\u2019 with Biden as the President and Democrats having control of both the House and the Senate would see a fiscal stimulus of over $3trn. However, if we have a Republican Senate, the fiscal stimulus is unlikely to exceed $1trn, irrespective of the President. This morning\u2019s rally in Europe follows a strong day\u2019s trading for shares in the Asia-Pacific region. China\u2019s CSI 300 index gained 1.2%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng jumped by nearly 2%, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 1.9% after the RBA slashed interest rates to record lows. The equity markets are pricing in the increased odds of \u201ca Biden win and a blue wave,\u201d says Hong Li, head of US equity quantitative strategy at Citigroup. He explains (via the FT) \u201cTimely and clear election results will remove one of the two major risks for the equity market and may bring a clearer picture of the potential stimulus package.\u201d Conversely, unclear or tardy results would muddy the picture, and probably spook the markets...especially if the result is contested. As Tom Kenny, senior international economist at ANZ, puts it: \u201cWe expect numerous litigation battles, particularly if the race is tight.\u201d The European stock market rally is holding firm. After over an hour\u2019s trading, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 1.2% to 351.94 points, with solid gains in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid. That\u2019s a one-week high, back to levels just before France and Germany announced new Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. As you can see, this is lifting the Stoxx 600 away from last week\u2019s five-month trough. But it\u2019s still down 15% this year, with the FTSE 100 having lost 24% of its value. John Hardy, head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, warns there could be \u2018considerable volatility\u2019 as the US election outcome becomes clear... particularly if the result is contested. Finally, it is U.S. Election Day, and although many official pollsters suggest very high odds of a Biden victory and the Democrats retaking the U.S. Senate, there are sufficient doubts on the outcome to make the election results a surprise to many. A contested election result tonight is rightfully seen as the most negative scenario, as it could drag out the uncertainty for weeks or longer. There are 35 Senate seats up for election today, and those battles will have a huge impact on whether a major stimulus package can be agreed quickly after the election. The Republicans currently have a 53-47 majority (plus Mike Pence\u2019s casting vote). Twenty three of their seats are being contested today, versus 12 Democrat-held seats, so the balance of power could shift. The latest polling suggests that Democratic challengers in two states, Arizona and Colorado, have a good chance in defeating Republican incumbents, while only one Democratic incumbent, in Alabama, seems to be at serious risk. In addition, seven of the Republican Senate seats in play today are seen as too close to call (\u2018tossups\u2019, in the jargon), according to the Cook Political Report. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients what to watch for: While the House of Representatives is seen as an incredibly likely win for the Democrats (97% in the FiveThirtyEight Model), their chances in the Senate stand at a noticeably lower 74%, so there remains the possibility that we could get a Republican Senate alongside a Biden White House. Indeed, our US economists view that as the most negative outcome for growth next year, because Republican senators would likely remain resistant to a big fiscal package, as they\u2019ve already done in recent weeks even with Mr. Trump in the White House. This contrasts with their view on a Democratic sweep of the presidency and both houses of Congress, which they see as providing the most fiscal stimulus to the economy next year. So it\u2019s clear that control of the Senate will be critical to the policy mix we can expect to see in 2021. Currently the Senate is split 53-47 to the Republicans, and in the event of a 50-50 tie, the Vice President casts the deciding vote. So that means to win control of the chamber, the Democrats would need to take a further 3 seats if Mr. Biden wins the presidency, and 4 seats if President Trump is re-elected. With Democrats likely to lose a seat in Alabama, the five key races to watch for Senate control will be in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. It\u2019s also worth noting that in Georgia, one of the races is a special election in which numerous candidates are running from both parties (no primary election took place) and none are expected to get the 50% + 1 votes needed to avoid a runoff under Georgia rules. The other Senate race in the state is also very close, with a chance of a third-party candidate keeping the winner under 50%, triggering a runoff as well. Those runoffs wouldn\u2019t take place until January 5, so in the event that control of the Senate were not clear, then majority control could come down to runoff elections in a single state in January. Australia\u2019s central bank has also cheered the markets today, by cutting interest rates to a record low and launching a new stimulus package. The Reserve Bank of Australia has slashed its official cash rate to a new historic low of 0.1%, in an attempt to revive the economy. It is also boosting its quantitative easing programme by $100bn. My colleague Ben Butler has the details: In what its governor, Philip Lowe, billed as a \u201cpackage of further measures to support job creation and the recovery of the Australian economy from the pandemic\u201d, the RBA also said it would wade deep into the bond market, buying $100bn of government bonds from banks over the next six months by printing money in a quantitative easing program. The bond purchases would not directly fund the government but would lower the cost of government borrowing and \u201cthe cost of finance for all other borrowers in Australia\u201d, Lowe said on Tuesday. We have a blue wave in the City this morning, as every sector of the FTSE 100 rallies. UK housebuilders are leading the charge in London, after home construction firm Crest Nicholson reported that profits will be above expectations this year. Mining stocks - a bellwether of economic confidence - are also posting gains, along with energy companies and banks. European stock markets have jumped to their highest level in nearly a week at the start of trading. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 79 points or 1.4% at 5735, as it continues to recover from last week\u2019s seven-month lows. Nearly every stock is higher this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX index and France\u2019s CAC both jumped around 0.6% at the open, clawing back some of their recent losses. Fiona Cincotta of Gain Capital suggests investors are positioning for a major post-election stimulus package: Joe Biden has been leading in the national polls by a comfortable 7 points for some time now, although the race is tighter in some key swing states, which will decide the election. Should Joe Biden manage to win the race, a blue wave, which includes control of the Senate is needed for the markets to really get excited about stimulus. A Republican controlled senate indicates more gridlock to come and the markets will need to drastically scale back stimulus expectations. The topic of additional fiscal stimulus in the US has been a market moving topic over the past few weeks amid failed attempts to break the gridlock. There is a good chance that the markets are more focused on the prospect of a large fiscal stimulus. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s only one issue dominating the markets today, the US Election. Even the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a back seat, as the world watches to see who wins the White House, and whether the Democrats can win control of the Senate from the Republicans. On these occasions, the markets always favour certainty. So polling site FiveThirtyEight\u2019s final forecast - that Joe Biden would win 89 times out of 100 - is calming the nerves. Last night, Wall Street put its October gloom behind it. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 423 points, or 1.6%, to 26,925, as stocks rallied. European stocks markets have just opened higher too. The FTSE 100 has gained over 1%, as the City brushes away anxiety over England\u2019s new Covid-19 lockdown. Many investors have already been positioning for a Blue Wave - the scenario in which the Democrats win the White house and the Senate, retaining control of the House of Representatives too. This would allow Biden to push through a major new stimulus programme, and implement his climate change plan. But of course, this isn\u2019t a normal election, with president Trump demanding that only votes counted on election night should count (even though vote counting typically carries on for days afterwards) Trump has denied a report that he plans to declare victory on Tuesday night if it looks like he\u2019s ahead. But he\u2019s also planning to sent in the lawyers once election day is over - a scenario that would surely rock the markets. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets reckons the latest opinion polls may have boosted spirits on Wall Street. The Dow jumping 400 points yesterday shows the exact same nervy trading that sent it lower hundred of points last week. We don\u2019t read this as a \u2018confident in stocks\u2019 400 points but more an \u2018too uncertain to keep selling\u2019 400 points. A 10-point Biden lead according to a poll from the NBC/Wall Street Journal may have offered investors some more strength in their convictions. But traders will also remember 2016, when stocks also rallied on election day amid confident forecasts that Hillary Clinton would beat Trump. Kyle Rodda of IG predicts a manic time ahead.... Our pricing is suggesting a strong open for European and US stocks tonight, ahead of what\u2019s going to be a manic 24-hours. Election day has finally arrived, and although the market seems to be betting on a Biden victory, there\u2019s so many potential outcomes to this event, that the way trade will unfold is almost unknowable. However, best and the worst result for the market is pretty clear: a definitive result, if not on election night, then in the couple of days following, will be greeted with great relief by the markets; a close, and subsequently contested, result would bring trepidation.
