Ireland's quest for back-to-back grand slams has fallen, crashed, bombed at the second hurdle. It is a hard feat, it would appear, winning consecutive grand slams. No one has done it since 1998. That was when France managed it, and who is to say they will not be the next grand-slam winners? Because they spanked the last lot here. Ireland were shell-shocked from around the 20th minute, which is pretty early for a champion team. They will say they brought it on themselves \u2013 and they may well be right \u2013 but if you give France reason to believe that they are having a good day it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. You gift them something early, then every subsequent bit of brilliance from them builds upon the previous one and reinforces the notion in their heads that they can do anything. And by the end they pretty much can. For most of the first 20 minutes, it had been all Ireland. This was when the visitors had to introduce the idea that it was they who were superior by scoring early. But two rank pieces of indiscipline round the 20-minute mark let France into the game, and that was that. Everything that could have gone wrong for Ireland did from then on. They had gone into the game with no outside backs on the bench, so what happened before the first half was out? An outside back, Rob Kearney, was hobbling towards the touchline. Ireland had to rejig their backline, and none of them enjoyed the new positions they had now to play in. Paddy Wallace came on at 12, Gordon D'Arcy was forced on to the wing, and Keith Earls moved from there to full-back. The one man who stayed put was Brian O'Driscoll, but even his majesty could not cope with all the changes, and, apart from a neat interplay down the left with Stephen Ferris to set up a consolation score for David Wallace with 15 minutes to go, this is not a game he will remember fondly. His opposite number, Mathieu Bastareaud, has a long way still to go to secure a ranking in the game's pantheon equal to O'Driscoll's, but the troubled youngster gave the smooth master a torrid time here, and the little flick he sent out just after he had thumped uncaringly into O'Driscoll's tackle set up Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud for France's third try on the hour. That was for a 24-3 lead. Coming at the end of a third quarter that had been wholly dominated by France, despite the champions' desperate need to get back into things, it was a sickeningly cruel blow. But that was well after the game had gone. We need to wind back a couple of quarters for the moment it started to leave. And it should come as no surprise to hear that it involved the sin bin. Yellow is all the rage this season \u2013 yellow cards and the weighty implications of them. Believe it or not, Ireland had looked magnificent in green for the first quarter of an hour. They ransacked France's line-out, they drove hard, and they picked holes in the French line. Their efforts reached a pitch when O'Driscoll found a way through. He chipped and chased, and if the ball had not kicked awkwardly left he would have scored the game's first try. Who knows what might have happened to that French psyche then... Instead, almost immediately, Imanol Harinordoquy was breaking clear of some indifferent defence down the left, and in a flash France were deep into Ireland's 22, any number of them offering themselves as options. Cian Healy grabbed Morgan Parra, the most obvious of those, but he did so before the little fella had been passed the ball. Yellow. Parra slotted the penalty, but still Ireland coped. Jerry Flannery, though, was the next Irishman to transgress, this one utter lunacy. With a penalty advantage being played to Ireland, he chose to hack maniacally at Alexis Palisson, instead of tackle him. It was a miracle Wayne Barnes did not reduce Ireland to 13 for that one, but the penalty was reversed, and 14-man Ireland were soon facing scrum after scrum on their five-metre line. Somehow they held out, but when France moved it William Servat drove at a hole between Tom\u00e1s O'Leary and Earls for the game's first try. Healy came back on then, and from the restart France conceded a penalty, which Ronan O'Gara slotted. But Ireland were spooked now. Bastareaud roared through a huge hole in the centres from a straightforward move off a scrum, and Yannick Jauzion surged over for a 17-3 lead on the half-hour. Ireland had fallen apart, and to add further misery Kearney was forced off a few minutes later to expose that eccentric decision by Declan Kidney to people his bench with two midfield backs. Ireland did mount a frenzied siege at the end of the half, turning down shots at goal that might have turned the game. But they were held inches out, before Leo Cullen spilled the ball and with it the match. Ireland could not cope with the French in the second half, nor the storm raging in their own heads as they tried so hopelessly to chase the game. The two late drop goals slotted by Parra and Frederic Michalak were just further insult to champions felled. With this, a 12-match unbeaten run has been broken, but that is the least of the things that Ireland now mourn. France, meanwhile, have their latest dawn to celebrate. They have yet to convince that these \u00fcber-performances can come in sequences of more than one or two, but for now they wear the mantle of favourites well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
