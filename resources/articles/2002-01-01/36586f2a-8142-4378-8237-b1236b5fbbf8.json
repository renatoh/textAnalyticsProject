By late afternoon, however, their junior driver S\u00e9bastien Loeb had taken the lead and Citroen had become the toast of France. Citroen's Alpine agony was a reminder that even if a rally can be won only on the special stages, it can easily be lost on the linking sections. That happened to the Swede Thomas Radstrom and the Frenchman Philippe Bugalski, who both failed to make it to the opening special stage. No wonder their engine tuner Claude Guillois wore a hunted look, muttering about a bad batch of parts. Both men retired their cars on the road section between Monaco and the service park in Digne-les-Bains after cracks appeared in their engine blocks. For Bugalski it was particularly galling because, as a tarmac specialist, he had high hopes of success in this event. Mercifully for Citroen, though, Loeb had blown his engine on Thursday and the spare came from a different batch. After a cautious start, the world junior rally champion coolly forced his way past Tommi Makinen and Colin McRae to lead a world championship rally for the first time. It was reminiscent of a sensational drive from another young Frenchman, Fran\u00e7ois Delecour, who led much of the 1991 Monte Carlo Rally on his first appearance in a four-wheel-drive car, only to break his Ford's suspension on the last stage. Loeb has all the makings of a future senior champion and he never seems flustered by pressure. \"It went well. Am I surprised? At the difference in times, perhaps,\" he said. Asked if he could keep his lead, he replied: \"Why not?\" Beating the Finn Makinen and the Scot McRae is an awesome challenge. Makinen is aiming to become the first driver to win four successive Montes since the German Walter R\u00f6hrl in 1980-84 and, like McRae, he could also become the first driver to win 24 world championship rallies. Makinen has adapted instantly on his first rally with Subaru, despite a messy spin on an icy hairpin, whereas McRae is striving dutifully to stay out of trouble on a rally he detests. He held third last night in his Ford. \"It's easier than usual with so little snow, but it's still very difficult,\" he said. Whereas McRae has every chance of winning, the world champion Richard Burns already looks a very long shot indeed. He was in seventh place last night, a minute off the lead, and admitted that he finds the Peugeot more nervous than the Subarus he had driven for the past three years. Indeed, he was lucky to continue when the car leapt off the road in top gear and careered into a field on the first stage. \"We're still finding out about it. I don't think I'm driving anywhere near our limit. I just want miles. I want to get to Corsica and Spain in a position to win. That's more important than trying to win one rally,\" he said. Colin's brother Alister McRae was taking an even more cautious approach, holding 13th place on his first rally for Mitsubishi. Sadly, rallying's uneasy relationship with its own popularity was all too apparent when the second stage, one of the longest of the rally, was can celled because of spectator overcrowding. A bad accident involving spectators is perhaps the greatest threat to rallying's future and before the start of this event the FIA president Max Mosley had promised that more stages would be cancelled this year if fans were standing in dangerous positions. The problem is exacerbated by the shorter, more compact routes that television demands, because tens of thousands of fans are corralled into smaller areas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
