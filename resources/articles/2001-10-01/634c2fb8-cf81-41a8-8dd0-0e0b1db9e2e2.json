Subs: William, Marcio Santos, Pedrosa, Martelinho, Loja, Bosingwa, Glauber. Liverpool: Dudek, Carragher, Henchoz, Hyypia, Riise, Murphy, McAllister, Hamann, Smicer, Fowler, Heskey. Subs: Kirkland, Redknapp, Berger, Biscan, Partridge, Wright, Litmanen. Referee: Karl-Erik Nilsson (Sweden) 1 This game reeks of a draw, if Liverpool's cautious approach to previous European ties is anything to go by. They may well be happy with a stalemate, but with Fowler in top form who knows. 2 Heskey makes an early charge down the left from Fowler's pass; Heskey's cross finds Fowler at the far post but he can only knock it into the centre of the Boavista area. It falls for McAllisster to force a tip-over by 'keeper Ricardo. The corner comes to nothing. Lively stuff from the opening by Liverpool. 6 Boavista push up for their first meaningful attack with Silva and Duda causing some scuttling at the back for LIverpool. Hyypia limping. 7 Substitution Wright on for Hyypia, who has tweaked a hamstring. 8 McAllister finds the net - offside. 9 Frechaut gives Riise the slip but Carragher covers the cross. 10 McAllister forward to Fowler who lays it off to Heskey on the left. Back to Fowler, back to McAllister, who slides to the by-line for Heskey to cross and 'keeper Ricardo to claim. A lot of play going down the left from Liverpool. 13 Boavista find their feet and put some pressure on Liverpool. No idea who was behind it all but the main move was a long ball into the area that came to nothing. 16 Free-kick to Liverpool 20 yards out after Turra had tugged down Fowler. Great work by Fowler to hold it up after a raking pass by Hamann. 17 GOAL: Boavista 0 - 1 Liverpool Murphy with the free-kick - curled it around the wall and sent 'keeper Ricardo dancing the wrong way. Sublime. 22 Duda has two attempts at conning the ref into giving a free-kick - ignored on both occasions by the ref who muct have seen a video of the clubs' last meeting. 26 Boavista flap and protest at the ref when he fails to penalise a Riise challenge Liverpool's left. Swiftly followed by another Boavista player doubling up after a perfectly fair, if crunching, tackle by Hamann. 27 Substitution Martelinho on Rui Oscar. 38 Goulart crosses to the far post for Duda to try an overhead kick - corner. Sanchez takes, comes to nothing. Boavista are coming on stronger now although Liverpool show no signs of crumbling. 30 Duda gets around Smicer on the by-line, Dudek parries the shot. The ball runs free in front of goal before Liverpool clear. 33 Boavista corner; Dudek pats it away for Boavista's Duda to blast high and over. 39 Duda lobs one in from nowhere for Silva to head at the far post - Dudek with a fingertip tip-over for a corner. Dudek claims but lands badly on his elbow. 45 Two minutes extra to play. Carragher hoofs it forward to Fowler on the left. Plays it in to Heskey, but Fowler static for the return Half-time Great stuff from Liverpool, who have not missed Hyypia after his early departure. Some wayward passing at times the only minus point. 46 Is a Boavista onslaught on the way in the second 45? Or are Liverpool well on their way to qualification for the last eight? 49 All Boavista so far with Liverpool finding it difficult to break out. Everyone bar Fowler behind the ball for the visitors. 53 Best chance for Liverpool since the goal. Fowler enters the area on the right and crosses for Heskey in space to volley at goal... great stop by Ricardo to keep it out. 57 Dudek forced to dive to his right after Duda squeezes a shot through from 20 yards. 58 Substitution Bosingwa and Marcio Santos on for Goulart and Duda. 59 Boavista corner; Santos takes, Turra puts it into the side-netting via a Liverpool leg. Second corner comes to nothing. Liverpool living dangerously. 60 GOAL: Boavista 1 - 1 Liverpool Yet another corner to Boavista. Sanchez into the box for Silva to head in the equaliser at the back post from six yards. 64 Booking Hamann. 69 Finally a corner for Liverpool after good work by Wright on the right; McAllister towartds Murphy 15 yards out but he can't get a decent shot in. 72 After a brief foray into the home half Liverpool are under pressure again as the home fans crank up the volume. 73 But then Liverpool break with Fowler in space on the left. He lets rip from 20 yards but Ricardo does the well to make the save. 76 Substitution Berger on for McAllister. 80 Petit rifles in a low shot from 20 yards but Dudek is equal to it. All up in the air at the moment - Liverpool relying on breaks with Boavista more keen to chase a result. 86 All Boavista now as they try to wrap things up. 89 Lots of head tennis around the Liverpool area is keeping things lively until the very end. 90 Three minutes extra to play. Fowler tries to lob the keeper from 30 yards but fails to get any height. Petit reprises his earlier low drive from 20 yards but this time it misses the right-hand post by a couple of feet. Full-time Nothing decided, Group B goes to the wire with Dortmund visiting Anfield next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
