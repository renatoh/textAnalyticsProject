Mark Tucker is returning after a brief stint as finance director of banking group HBOS following the sudden ousting of Jonathan Bloomer. City sources expect a clash between Mr Tucker and Mark Wood, the chief executive of Prudential's UK business, who is said to have been furious when he heard of his former colleague's appointment. Mr Wood is thought to believe he was unfairly passed over for the top job, a role that some in the City thought he was more likely to achieve after Mr Tucker quit two years ago. Mr Tucker, who ran the Pru's fast-growing Asian arm, left without another position to go to when it seemed likely he would never be chief executive. He was a popular figure with investors and analysts and until then had been seen as Mr Bloomer's heir apparent. Mr Tucker, a former professional footballer, takes up his role the day after Thursday's annual meeting where, somewhat unusually, Mr Bloomer will attend as chief executive. It is rare for a chief executive who has, in effect, been pushed out of his job to be expected to attend an annual meeting with his former colleagues to field questions from shareholders. It is thought that Mr Bloomer believes he can justify his tenure after figures showed that group sales rose 11% to \u00a3478m in the three months to end-March. The strong performance of the UK business is also thought to have given Mr Wood - who has been cited as a possible chief executive for Legal &amp; General - fresh confidence. Mr Wood would only say that he supported the decision to appoint Mr Tucker. \"The board made a unanimous decision. There are no ifs or buts about it,\" Mr Wood said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
