In an interview immediately after Tuesday's publication of the highly critical Baker report into BP's safety management, Mr Sutherland played down speculation that Lord Browne's departure, which has been brought forward, would hasten his own exit. \"The board of BP concluded in my absence some time ago that I should stay through the succession of John Browne and remain for a time after that,\" he said. \"It was not considered desirable that too many changes should take place at the same time.\" After Tony Hayward takes over as chief executive this summer, BP is expected to lose its chief financial officer, Byron Grote, when he reaches retirement age in the first half of next year. The moves come after a difficult year when BP has been beset by boardroom strife, by the aftermath of the Texas City refinery blast, America's worst industrial accident in a decade, and Alaskan oil spills. Lord Browne, the 58-year-old who had spent his entire career at BP, announced his departure last week, 17 months ahead of schedule. It came after a bruising battle with the board last summer over whether his term should be extended past his 60th birthday. He will chair the non-advisory board of the private equity group Apax Partners when he leaves BP. In 2005, Mr Sutherland's term as non-executive chairman was extended until 2009. This week, he said: \"[The board] wanted a significant overlap and Tony Hayward has also said he wanted me to stay for a period into his new office. It will be for some time after he takes office.\" Mr Sutherland denied the suggestion that the BP board was accountable for the safety failings in its US refinery plants. Analysts expect further civil cases to result after the harsh words for BP's management in the Baker report. \"It does not make any suggestion of any legal failure on the part of the board,\" he said. \"It expressly says that. \"We're about the only company I know that has had a full main board committee, and has had for some years, dealing with issues of safety ... and we've had an enormous improvement in safety ... That's not to say we're perfect, because we're not.\" He described the Baker report as \"harsh in places\", but said: \"I'm not complaining ... we've accepted the recommendations.\" The 10 recommendations included engaging an independent monitor to report annually on safety for at least five years. It also said the BP board \"must provide effective leadership and establish appropriate goals for process safety\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
