S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s side led 1-0 after the first leg in Russia, but Dutch midfielder Tonny Vilhena levelled the tie early on in Portugal, volleying home from a corner. Winger Shapi Suleymanov then struck twice, finishing counterattacks in clinical fashion to put Krasnodar in control of the tie at half-time. Porto rallied in the second half, with Z\u00e9 Lu\u00eds and Luis D\u00edaz pulling two goals back, but Krasnodar held on to progress to the final play-off round on away goals. They will now face Olympiacos, who overcame Istanbul Basaksehir 3-0 on aggregate. It is only the second time since winning the trophy under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004 that Porto have failed to reach the Champions League group stages. Krasnodar did not even exist then \u2013 last season\u2019s third-placed finishers in Russia were founded in 2008. Last season\u2019s semi-finalists Ajax were given a scare by Greek champions PAOK Salonika before squeezing through to the final qualifying round. After a 2-2 draw in the first leg, PAOK took the lead in Amsterdam through Diego Biseswar, a winger developed at Ajax\u2019s academy, who fired inside the near post from 18 yards. Dusan Tadic missed a penalty, but scored a second to bring Ajax level on the night, and ahead on away goals. Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico then scored a header with 10 minutes to go to put Ajax 4-3 up on aggregate, before a second Tadic penalty saw the hosts through despite Biseswar\u2019s second goal in stoppage time. Ajax will face Cyprus\u2019s Apoel in the play-offs after they overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit to defeat Qarabag with a 2-0 victory in Azerbaijan. Elsewhere, Club Brugge edged out Dynamo Kyiv after a frantic finale, the Belgian side prevailing 4-3 on aggregate after a 3-3 draw \u2013 with three goals coming in the last five minutes. Club Brugge will next play LASK Linz, who followed up a 2-1 away win over Basel with a 3-1 home victory. Kemal Ademi\u2019s 80th-minute effort set up a nervous finish, but late goals from Thomas Goiginger and Marko Raguz secured the Austrians\u2019 play-off place. Celtic crashed out after losing 4-3 at home to CFR Cluj, who will face Slavia Prague next, while Rosenborg and Dinamo Zagreb set up a play-off tie with comfortable aggregate wins. Only one tie went to penalties \u2013 and the shootout didn\u2019t disappoint, with Red Star Belgrade edging out Copenhagen 7-6 after 22 spot kicks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
