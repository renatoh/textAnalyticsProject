The paper says the depiction in the movie of now-deceased reporter Kathy Scruggs, played by Olivia Wilde, is \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201chighly defamatory\u201d. It wants Hollywood executives to add a disclaimer in the film about the part. Richard Jewell depicts Scruggs as sleeping with an FBI agent to draw out information from a source in the aftermath of the 1996 Olympic Bombing in Atlanta. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution has repeatedly, in recent weeks, denounced the movie\u2019s treatment of the veteran reporter, who broke the news that the FBI was focusing on Jewell in the investigation. \u201cSuch a portrayal makes it appear that the AJC sexually exploited its staff and/or that it facilitated or condoned offering sexual gratification to sources in exchange for stories. That is entirely false and malicious, and it is extremely defamatory and damaging,\u201d says the letter from lawyer Marty Singer on behalf of the paper, to Eastwood, screenwriter Billy Ray and Warner Brothers executives. The letter was obtained by Deadline. Singer, who has defended and represented celebrities for decades, including the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Charlie Sheen and Jeremy Piven, has threatened Eastwood and other Hollywood executives with a defamation lawsuit on behalf of the AJC. It\u2019s not how the AJC operates, said Kevin Riley, the paper\u2019s top editor, to the Daily Beast after Warner Brothers dismissed the paper\u2019s claims as \u201cbaseless\u201d. \u201cWe find it extremely troubling in these times when the media is under almost constant attack, for a film that claims to be portraying a real situation to suggest that this is how journalists operate,\u201d Riley said to the Daily Beast. A number of journalists have called the portrayal of Scruggs \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, taking to social media to defend female journalists who are repeatedly portrayed by Hollywood in this sexist trope. Wilde has said she did her research on Scruggs but the AJC followed up with close friends, family and former colleagues who say they never heard from Wilde, despite offering their assistance to writers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
