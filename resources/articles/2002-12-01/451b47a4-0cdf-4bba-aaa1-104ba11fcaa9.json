The old Lincolnshire hands have pulled on thick black rubber waders in the back of their Transit van, slung flasks into bags and climbed into the wooden crate on the back of the tractor with their gangmaster, Malcolm. They disappear into the gloom at the other end of the field. Graham's gang has parked its battered Transit in deep furrows behind Malcolm's but he and his men are taking five minutes for a few last drags on their fags before braving the penetrating damp of the Fens and seven hours bent double over brussels stalks. Then they stumble out into the blackness and contemplate the churned-up trenches of silt between them and the harvest. \"Shite, we can't walk half a mile in this, you can hardly lift your boots.\" They start picking sprouts on the edge of the field instead and wait for the tractor to come back. Frenzy For the past week, Lincolnshire has been a frenzy of activity as growers and labourers have increased production by up to 700%, working through the night to deliver millions of fresh sprouts to the supermarkets in time for Christmas dinner. The rumour last week was that bad weather would create a shortage of sprouts. It has not, but because the wind and rain have blown the plants over, they cannot be harvested by machine as usual and have had to be picked by hand. Malcolm and Graham provide land labour to Holme Farm, one of the biggest sprout and vegetable growers for the Asda chain of supermarkets. Asda alone will sell about 140m sprouts this Christmas. The gangmasters and their men work in teams of six or eight. They generally do 12-hour shifts on the harvesting machines, but seven hours is about as much as even the most experienced labourers can do hand-pulling. It is piece work, \u00a32 for a three- to four-stone sack of sprouts, but you can earn more hand-pulling than on the machines. The best pickers will take home \u00a3300-\u00a3350 for a 50-60 hour week. By 8am Malcolm and his men are steadily cutting a swath along the lines, attacking each plant with a mechanical rhythm: they grasp a stalk between the knees, legs straight, back doubled, break off the spiral of sprouts with a downward sweep of the hands, and toss them into a sack. Then heave the sack forward, grasp the next... the sound of the vegetables snapping rings through the marsh mist like distant rifle shot. In a field nearby, Pip, \"the legend of Grimsby\", and his mates are managing to work the harvesting machine. They got up at 4.30am to get here in their van and usually clear \u00a340-\u00a350 a day each. Two men with machetes cut the stalks and toss them into the trailer alongside, in which three more men, sitting under a canvas canopy splattered with mud, push the stalks through rotating drums of knives. \"So here it is, merry Christmas, everybody's having fun... \" blares out from the transistor and sparks a round of banter from the men before they fall silent again with the effort. \"You don't want to be old doing this job, it's bloody hard,\" Pip says. \"By the way, you've strayed into the competition. This is a Sainsbury's field, not Asda.\" Only a tiny proportion of what is produced goes to wholesale markets any more; most is grown for supermarkets. Once back at the farm, the Asda sprouts go through a huge packing shed. Here grading machines with giant, juddering rollers sort them into different channels - too small, too large, just right for the supermarket specification of 30mm-40mm. Just under two-thirds of the crop will make the grade, according to Holme Farm's owners, Roger and Pat Wellberry, who have themselves been putting in 14-hour days this week. Roger is a third-generation sprout farmer and thinks everyone should be eating the little green things all the time. \"They used to be big and rank, but not now, with the modern varieties.\" He's even drunk sprout cocktail - liquidised sprouts with lemon juice and armagnac. \"It tasted all right, it just had a bit of a whiff of, well you know, sprout.\" The packing shed has been running 24 hours a day for Christmas, working in two 12-hour shifts. Carol is one of a dozen or so workers standing over the rollers from 6am to 6pm pulling off any sprouts that are damaged or have the odd blemish. She was up at 4.15 to drop her son at the babysitter, and has started to see sprouts in her sleep. The night shift is mostly field pickers who have been pulled inside to cope with the Christmas rush, plus Darren, a retained firefighter in the day who is pleased to have the extra cash, even if after a few hours the sprouts all start dancing before his eyes in a sea of bilious green. After grading, the sprouts are tipped into a hopper to be channelled into net bags of 750g and labelled, before being dispatched. Convoy About 15 miles away another large growing and packing company, Fresh Lincs Vegetables, is responsible for coordinating all the deliveries from the farmers to the Asda depots. By the next morning the sprouts are on their way in a stream of lorries to one of the eight Asda regional depots which service its stores around the country. Bob is taking a 40ft trailer load south to the Dartford depot which supplies all the Asda supermarkets in the south-east, while Holme Farm's own fleet is trucking sprouts to the depots in the Midlands, the north and Scotland. The depots all work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Bob has been a food lorry driver for 25 years. This week his company is doing double runs, day and night, to keep the depots supplied. By mid-afternoon, Bob has arrived and is parked in a holding bay until he can dock and unload. Like air traffic control, the unloading and reloading of lorries requires precision planning. Less than 12 hours later and the sprouts are on their way to a store in south London where the grocery manager has taken five or six deliveries through the night. By mid-morning the following day, queues have formed outside the supermarket waiting for opening time and crates of sprouts have been stacked up just inside the doors. \"It's like bulls going through the streets of Spain. We just stand back and let them go for it,\" says grocery manager Paul. It took six people last night to get everything unloaded and into position in his store. Within 10 minutes of opening, there is a trolley gridlock at the entrance. A woman snaps at her partner that she hasn't got time to deviate for oranges, hasn't he seen the crowds? And a small boy pushes in and says: \"Uurgh, mum, sprouts.\" Stocking up \u00b7 Most supermarkets will close today at some time between 5pm and 7pm \u00b7 In the seven days running up to Christmas Asda estimates it will have sold 140m individual sprouts and 750,000 tonnes of Christmas pudding \u00b7 Marks &amp; Spencer estimates it will have sold more than 500 tonnes of sprouts over the Christmas period \u00b7 Ducks are creeping up on turkeys as the favourite roast dinner with sales up by 90% at Asda \u00b7 In preparation for the festive rush Tesco stores have stocked up with 2.25m fresh and frozen turkeys, 72m mince pies and 16m Christmas crackers \u00b7 Safeway says it is selling 1,000 times more sprouts than it would expect to sell in a normal week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
