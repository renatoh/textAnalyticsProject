The club's chairman Rupert Lowe remains convinced that Hoddle should be given the chance to take charge again, but will be keeping an eye on the scale of the inevitable fan protests before deciding how quickly to proceed. However, there is only a slim chance that Southampton will abandon their interest in Hoddle altogether and appoint the former Marseille manager Alain Perrin. Southampton believe only a small minority of fans are driving the anti-Hoddle lobby and have been encouraged by the number who have either stated support for the man Spurs sacked in October or insisted that priority is to back the players, regardless of who is in charge. Chants opposing Hoddle's return were heard at St Mary's during Southampton's last home game - a goalless draw with Fulham and before Gordon Strachan had cleared out his locker - and were repeated, albeit mildly, in the subsequent defeat at Arsenal. Antipathy stems from Hoddle's departure to manage Tottenham just under three years ago. Southampton were eighth in the league at the time and had won five consecutive Premiership matches. Lowe and Hoddle have been doing their best over the past week to clear the way for the appointment by talking publicly about the matter. Hoddle has claimed that Spurs are the only club for which he would have left Southampton and made it clear he is keen to return. \"I very much hope the fans would allow me to try to take the club on to the next level,\" he said. Lowe has challenged supporters to leave behind \"the baggage of the past\" by accepting that \"sometimes the most popular decisions are not the right ones\". Steve Wigley will be in charge of Southampton for Saturday's game. He was put in temporary control of the first team last Friday, after Strachan quit earlier than anticipated to begin his sabbatical. Wigley had been looking after the reserves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
