Opening the festival is the world premiere of Levity, starring Billy Bob Thornton as a murderer in search of redemption. Other pictures on offer include tales of mental illness, juvenile detention centres and global apocalypse. The line-up may have something to say about the current state of the American psyche, but the festival itself is in good health. Industry observers are predicting that this will be the most successful Sundance ever. This year's programme includes 127 feature films, numerous shorts, talks and workshops. Organisers say some 20,000 actors, film-makers and fans are likely to converge on the mountain town of Park City in Utah over the next 10 days, all but overwhelming the indigenous population of 7,300. Business is predicted to be especially brisk this year, as studios now see the festival as the first chance to snap up the year's hottest independent films. Although many of the buyers don't know what they're looking for until they actually see it. \"You really need an X-factor,\" Hollywood buyer Joe Sloss told the Hollywood Reporter. \"It's hard to know what's going to pop.\" Among the other premieres at this year's event are Owning Mahowny, the bank-fraud thriller starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, and an American remake of Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective, starring Robert Downey Jr. The hottest ticket in town is reputed to be for Thomas (Festen) Vinterberg's It's All About Love, a sci-fi romance featuring Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix, and set in a post-apocalyptic America. People I Know, starring Al Pacino as a New York press agent in meltdown, will also receive its long-awaited unveiling. The film was held back and re-edited after September 11 because of a scene in which Pacino's character hallucinates that the World Trade Centre is lying on its side. In the dramatic competition slot, the juvenile detention drama The United States of Leland is already generating a major buzz. The film stars Ryan Gosling, acclaimed for his role in The Believer, as a teenage murderer, Don Cheadle as his social worker and Kevin Spacey as his anguished father. Rivals for the top prize include All the Real Girls, a study of a small-town stud by George Washington director David Gordon Green, and Party Monster, a true-life tale featuring former child star Macaulay Culkin as an events organiser who kills his drug dealer. The Sundance prize will be presented on January 25."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
