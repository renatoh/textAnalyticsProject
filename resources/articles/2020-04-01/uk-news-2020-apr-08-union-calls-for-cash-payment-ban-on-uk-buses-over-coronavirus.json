Unite called on Wednesday for an end to cash payments on all the bus systems still operating across the UK to help drive down infection rates, particularly as the country enters the predicted peak period of the outbreak over Easter and beyond. In Northern Ireland, Translink, the only state-owned public transport company left in the UK, announced it would no longer accept cash payments to protect staff and commuters from the virus. Translink also confirmed that all local NHS staff would travel free on its bus fleet. Almost all parts of the UK outside of Unite\u2019s London and Eastern region, which covers the capital and the areas east of it across to the coast, operate some form of cash payment on their buses. Bobby Morton, the union\u2019s national officer for passenger transport, said suspending all cash payments would be one of the most practical ways bus companies and the Department for Transport would reduce infection among his members. He said: \u201cWe have asked the bus companies\u2019 representative body to stop cash payments during the crisis. We have also lobbied them to raise this in a meeting with the Department for Transport on Wednesday. \u201cThis one single move would not only reduce the risk of infection for our drivers but also give them some peace of mind. Because many of them tell their union that they are worried that they could also in turn infect their families when they come off shift.\u201d Within the bus system, those at the sharp end have relayed a mixed picture regarding access to personal protective hygiene measures, public behaviour and bus companies\u2019 responses to Unite\u2019s concerns. Unite\u2019s representatives in Northern Ireland and Wales said they were generally pleased with the response of the companies running bus routes. However, as Unite and other transport unions mourn the loss of 14 bus workers who have died from Covid-19 since the lockdown, individual drivers have contacted the Guardian raising concerns in areas outside London over access to protective equipment and hygiene products. One bus driver in the south-east who did not want to be identified said: \u201cI have had to buy my own sanitising wipes and hand gel because management never offered any. In fact, when our union reps first asked for hand gel to be provided during a meeting with managers at the start of the lockdown one of them asked the shop stewards, \u2018Won\u2019t the gel pose a danger because a drive with it on his or her hands would make the steering wheel slippy?\u2019 That is what we are up against.\u201d Another driver on a south-east England bus network said: \u201cSome of the passengers are definitely better protected than we are. Some of them have masks which we don\u2019t have. \u201cYesterday I drove a bus with a security screen where the holes had been clingfilmed over! I think it was probably a driver rather than a management rule being implemented.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
