But a pleasure for us to bring to you, as always, and thanks for all your emails/tweets/Bono jokes. Sorry I couldn\u2019t use everything, but your company is hugely appreciated! Take care, and see you again soon. Harry Maguire speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, the boys are devastated in there. We created numerous chances, you\u2019ve got to win the game and the better team lost. They punished us. We started at a high press and scored but maybe let them out too easily and allowed them too much possession. They didn\u2019t create too many chances if we\u2019re honest, conceding two goals from crosses is not good enough. We worked our socks off and deserved to go through but falling short at three semi-finals is not good enough.\u201d Here is Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report! I certainly don\u2019t think it helped. United\u2019s starting front line looked blistering for long periods but had ground to a halt by the time De Jong scored. \u201cIt looks like United are closing Bono\u2019s show with a stirring rendition of Running to Stand Still,\u201d writes Peter Oh, who assures me this is the fifth track on The Joshua Tree. I\u2019ll let Peter have this as the most obscure \u2013 relatively at least \u2013 reference yet. That 10-minute spell, where Martial in particular should have scored a few, was critical. You sense Sevilla knew they\u2019d earned a reprieve, thanks partly to solid goalkeeping from Bono, and they worked their way back into the game before pouncing. They\u2019re old hands at this! United ended up looking knackered and despondent. But they\u2019ll go again next season. The Europa League wizards are a game away from doing it again! They celebrate wildly; United rue that succession of missed chances, particularly early in the second half. 90+5 min: De Jong really should tee up Vazquez for a third but United cut out his centre. Even better, he should have gone for the corner flag. United break and he\u2019ll be in trouble if they score ... but again Sevilla repel their attack. 90+4 min: Ighalo gets some early possession around the box but is crowded out. Then Mata aims a really poor, especially by his standards, cross into Bono\u2019s arms. Sevilla are almost there. 90+3 min: Here\u2019s Odion Ighalo! He is on for Greenwood and has three minutes to make a difference. 90+1 min: They do, however, have six added minutes. James has a sniff at attacking a far-post cross but doesn\u2019t gamble and the ball sails out. United press, press and press some more, but Sevilla are currently not for buckling ... 90 min: Time is running out and United look out of ideas ... 87 min: The cavalry are coming! James, Mata and Fosu-Mensah will come on in United\u2019s first changes \u2013 replacing Williams, Wan-Bissaka and Rashford. For Sevilla, Gudelj is on for Jordan. 86 min: Is Fernando about to concede a second United penalty? No, there\u2019s a quick VAR check but, much to Fernandes\u2019 chagrin, nothing wrong with his challenge on the earlier goalscorer. Shortly after, a frustrated-looking Maguire is booked. 84 min: It\u2019s delivered well to the back post, where Vazquez volleys over. The goal has put a real spring in Sevilla\u2019s step. Suddenly they look confident and controlled. 83 min: United need something ... anything ... but the ball is in their territory and Sevilla can slow it down with a corner. 81 min: That period after half-time always looked important. Sevilla have been flat this half but are too good not to create *something*. And so it proved ... United will be absolutely kicking themselves here. They went a little flat and were ruthlessly punished by the substitute, once a non-scoring Newcastle loanee. Well, well, well. That\u2019s football, right? Navas is given too much time to cross from the right, it takes a snick and De Jong is unmarked in front of goal to stab adroitly past De Gea. United switched off and Lindelof is getting a few glares in particular, he just let De Jong go. 77 min: A bit of a basketball feel now as the teams counter, counter-counter and counter-counter-counter. In one of those counters, Williams wants a free-kick on the edge of the box but does not get his wish. 75 min: No penalty. Quite right. Suso comes off now, to be replaced by Vazquez. 73 min: After a wait, Jordan hits the free-kick, at an angle, into the wall and then a Suso effort is charged down. Sevilla want a handball from that first shot as it thwacked into Fernandes\u2019 arm ... but you really can\u2019t give that can you? The VAR checks ... 71 min: Navas crosses towards De Jong but it\u2019s headed away. Sevilla have certainly stabilised but aren\u2019t offering that much. Reguilon is caught clumsily by Wan Bissaka just outside the box though ... 69 min: Pogba drives optimistically over. We are starting to smell extra time ... 67 min: Sevilla have got a bit spikier, fouling a fair bit, but not too much sparkier with those changes. United, for their part, have gone a touch flat since that blistering first eight or nine minutes of the half. Rashford is booked for dissent when conceding a throw-in. 65 min: \u201cProbably already done, but: at the risk of an intentional Partridge, I can only hope United score so Bono can mutter to himself \u2018Sunday, bloody Sunday\u2019,\u201d says Tim Horner and, yes, two other people as well. 61 min: Bono has been good but I\u2019d say none of those saves was \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Most of the time he stood tall and didn\u2019t commit rashly, and that kind of presence is so vital in a keeper. I tend to find saves, in and of themselves, are gushed over a bit too much 80% of the time. And now I\u2019ll end this searing hot take. 58 min: It\u2019s still all United, with Sevilla at sixes and sevens defensively, but Bono hasn\u2019t been called upon to make a potentially gamechanging save for some five minutes now. 56 min: Attacking shakeup from Sevilla, who have put nothing together in this half. Ocampos is replaced by Munir, and De Jong comes on for En-Nesyri. 55 min: Going to need some pretty niche Bono puns at this rate. United could have won this game in the last 10 minutes. And might be worried they haven\u2019t ... 53 min: My goodness me, Bono saves *again*! And AGAIN! United\u2019s high press sees Martial mug Banega, Pogba subsequently returning the ball to the striker. He\u2019s one-on-one but Bono stands up and saves with a foot. Moments later, he does something similar in an almost identical situation. This is a quite incredible spell. 50 min: Oh, and United have another big chance! And another! Bono comes to the rescue again with a big save at the far post from Martial, with Rashford then denied by last-ditch challenge from Fernando. Then a Fernandes drive inside the box is brilliantly blocked. Somehow Sevilla stay level! 49 min: United have, as in the first half, come out very positively here. Sevilla look far less convincing on the back foot than the front. 46 min: Great save by Bono! Forty-six seconds into the half, Fernandes wafts one through to Greenwood and the youngster\u2019s first touch is superb. But so is the save, diverting the ball away when you\u2019d have backed United to regain the lead! The second half has started. Gavin May asks: \u201cSurprised no one felt the foul on Rashford for the pen wasn\u2019t a red card \u2013 studs showing full force into the shin \u2013 endangering an opponent? Seen plenty of reds for similar fouls in the middle of the park.\u201d Maybe, it was a really poor challenge on second viewing. Equally, you don\u2019t always see those ones after a shot given as pens (rightly or wrongly). Toby emails, seemingly with the sole intention of making me blindly jealous: \u201cHello from a very chilled out Leros in Greece. Social distancing is easy as there\u2019s no one here! A joy. What a great game so far. Sevilla are a lovely side and Utd are looking better as the game goes on. Think we\u2019re on for a cracking second half with Utd to edge it. Fingers crossed.\u201d A fine half played at a great tempo. Suso equalised Fernandes\u2019 early penalty and I make that fair, at this point. Don\u2019t go away \u2013 anything could happen here. 45+2 min: Marvellous play by Pogba on the edge of his box sends Rashford away again, and he gets into the Sevilla area with defenders backing off and looking petrified. But he gets his feet in a muddle and Sevilla survive! 45+1 min: Another parry from Bono \u2013 this time when Fernandes sets himself up a volley and thuds one down the keeper\u2019s throat from 20 yards. 45 min: Rashford sears down the left, cuts inside but shoots well wide. Two added minutes of the half to come. 43 min: Williams and En-Nesyri, the Sevilla striker, have a tussle and Williams goes down, with United claiming there were some naughty afters. Didn\u2019t see much that fitted that description, really, and nothing is done. 42 min: Ocampos tracks back assiduously to rob Greenwood. Sevilla do have some lovely players. So do United \u2013 which means we\u2019ve had a really interesting first half. 39 min: Fair play, that was quite a hit from Rashford given the range. Bono has to make sure and parry the wickedly moving ball. 38 min: United are more on the front foot now, Greenwood and Martial just finding themselves crowding out as they tip-tap towards the six-yard box. Banega then concedes a free-kick and United might have a shooting chance from 30+ yards ... 35 min: \u201cYou can guarantee a Man Utd penalty will get rival fans throwing conspiracy theories all over the place. But it stands to reason that a team that had quick, fleet footed attackers should get more penalties. Plus with VAR, surely a poorly given penalty would be overruled? Besides the Villa penalty, can anyone name one Utd didn\u2019t get fairly?\u201d asks Kevin Wilson. Let\u2019s head this off at the pass \u2013 I agree with this email. 33 min: Pogba tries to free Rashford but it\u2019s cut out. Then Martial has a great sight of goal from 18 yards after Greenwood tees him up ... but he whips his first-time effort just over! 32 min: Reguilon, on loan from Real Madrid, is absolute *lightning* down there. His latest foray is held up but what a player he looks. 29 min: Fernandes, full of fun, tries to catch Bono off his line from halfway. He overcooks it but United do need to rediscover the flair they showed at the start. 28 min: Maguire heads a corner harmlessly over. We really have a game here! They\u2019d been threatening and probably deserve it. The goal is a fine one, Ocampos feeding the bursting Reguilon \u2013 who has been excellent from left-back. Reguilon\u2019s low centre is perfect for ex-Liverpool man Suso to slam home at the far post. United are furious as they, not Sevilla, should have been awarded a throw-in at the start of the move \u2013 but that\u2019s not in VAR\u2019s remit. And to be fair, Sevilla were 70 yards from goal at that point. 24 min: A slightly scrappy phase, though Ocampos heads over from a Reguilon cross as I type. United seem to want to lure Sevilla\u2019s full-backs as high as possible and then streak in behind. 22 min: A dangerous low Navas centre from the right is hacked away. He\u2019s still got legs at 34! Could he have done a job for City last night ... ? (*hides*) 19 min: That penalty was United\u2019s 22nd of the season, conspiracy wizards! At the moment they seem happy to sit in a bit more. About 10 zillion of you have sent this in but it\u2019s easiest, in the heat of the battle, to paste a tweet. 16 min: De Gea parries a meaty shot from the lively Ocampos, from an angle on the left. This game is absolutely not done, Sevilla are bright and bubbly going forward. 14 min: Good chance for Fred! United win the ball, initially through Fred actually, and then sweep upfield. Fred is in acres on the right side of the box but would rather the ball was on his left foot. He slices wide of the near post with his right. 13 min: Sevilla\u2019s goalkeeper is called Bono and, as you might expect, my inbox is buckling under all your wisecrackery. Keep it coming and I\u2019ll try my best to do an email roundup at the break. 11 min: Sevilla look for an instant response and again make hay down that left side, but Banega can\u2019t quite control well enough to get a shot in when reasonably placed. A hop, a jump and a quite brilliantly taken penalty into the top corner. His 12th goal for United! Martial slips Rashford in and his shot is well parried by Bono ... but he\u2019s clipped by Diego Carlos on the follow-through and United have a spot kick! Did the follow-through affect the shot? I\u2019m not sure. But Fernandes will take it, pending a VAR check ... 7 min: Ever Banega, one of the best \u201calmost top-top-top\u201d players of recent years, is pulling some strings early on. If Sevilla lose it\u2019ll be his last game for them \u2013 he\u2019s off to Al Shabab in Saudi Arabia. But oh ... ! 5 min: Sevilla had a frayed first minute or two but now, from a good move down the left, Reguilon earns them a corner. It\u2019s headed away by Fernandes at the near post. But a good brisk tempo to this early on. 2 min: Good start from United! Greenwood slices into the box but can\u2019t quite make room for a shot. Fernandes has a blast but it\u2019s deflected behind, and then Maguire heads over after the corner is half-cleared but inflicts a foul in the process. United, right to left, kick off. The players are emerging ... we will kick off soon! United in black, Sevilla in white. From Woolie Madden: \u201cAs part of my research before this game (each Europa League game I submit a 20-page dossier for inclusion in my son\u2019s school newsletter \u2013 none printed so far) I came across the surprising fact that Sevilla have had an English, a Scottish and two Irish managers in their history. But for me, no one can top the wonderful six months in 1995 when they were managed by the marvellously named Otto Bumbel.\u201d I think it might have been in 1964 unless we are looking at different Otto Bumbels \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t want the kids being misinformed now. Otherwise, heck of a name and do go on Wiki for a look at his career, quite a life ... \u201cIn what world can we see this one-off tournament format continuing? Whatever happens tonight, everything in Lisbon and K\u00f6ln has been buckets of fun and I\u2019d be only too pleased to see it happen with fans one day. Obviously participating clubs wouldn\u2019t be too keen on losing matchday revenue from two-legged ties, but this just seems too good to drop,\u201d asks Matthew Richman. It\u2019s been great, hasn\u2019t it? I get that it means aberrations are more likely but what\u2019s wrong with that? I think everyone agrees it\u2019s been a success \u2013 but I don\u2019t see it continuing in \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances. The big dogs want more face-offs against each other, not fewer. \u201cBig call to put in Fred over Matic, hope it works out for Ole and we make the final,\u201d writes Neil Carter. Definitely an eye-catcher but Fred did start against Copenhagen and Linz. Digvijay Yadav writes in on an even bigger selection controversy \u2013 De Gea starts! \u201cI have to say, the decision to drop Romero does not sit well with me, not least because it backfired against Chelsea. Romero has won this tournament before and he is the cup keeper. Ergo, he should start.\u201d Some Manchester United transfer news ... Get in the mood for the match ... Sevilla: Bono, Navas, Kounde, Carlos, Reguilon, Banega, Fernando, Jordan, Suso, En-Nesyri, Ocampos Subs: Vaclik, Javi Diaz, Sergi Gomez, Escudero, Gudelj, Vazquez, Oliver Torres, Munir, De Jong, Lara, Genaro y Pablo Perez. Manchester United: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Fernandes, Pogba, Greenwood, Rashford, Martial Subs: Grant, Romero, Bailly, Mata, Lingard, Pereira, James, Fosu-Mensah, Ighalo, Matic, McTominay, Mengi This European knock-out stuff is proving to be a jolly good wheeze, isn\u2019t it? That was certainly the case for Manchester United fans last night, anyway, as they watched City flunk it in the Champions League against a \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 modest Lyon side. And it was the case for literally anyone who isn\u2019t desperate for Barcelona to win games of football, or Bayern to lose them, just 24 hours previously. So what awaits in the second continental competition tonight? Between them, these two have won six of the last 14 Europa Leagues. OK, so five of those have gone to Sevilla but this is definitely a clash of heavyweights \u2013 with the winner facing Internazionale or Shakhtar in what is a mouthwatering climax to this tournament. Both sides scraped through the quarters, Sevilla overcoming Wolves late on and United edging it against Copenhagen. The La Liga side \u2013 they finished fourth \u2013also beat Roma en route here so have arguably had the tougher journey. But all bets are off tonight, in my book. This semi-final could be an absolute belter and seems too tough to call. Can Ole steer United a tantalising step closer to silverware? Or is he in for a Sevilla disappointment? We don\u2019t know yet \u2013 but we will soon \u2013 and that\u2019s the beauty of it! Stay close, because the team news is coming right up ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
