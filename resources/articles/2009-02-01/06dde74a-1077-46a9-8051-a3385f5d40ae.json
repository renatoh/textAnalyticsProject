The decision, revealed at a hearing in a San Francisco appeals court, came days after the British high court ruled that evidence of renditions and torture must remain secret so as not to endanger the intelligence relationship between the two countries. The appeal in San Francisco's ninth US circuit court concerned the case of Binyam Mohamed, the subject of last week's high court ruling, and four other men. Civil rights lawyers had brought the appeal in the hope that the justice department would reverse the Bush-era policy. Last February the Bush administration intervened in a case brought against Jeppeson Dataplan, a subsidiary of Boeing, persuading Judge James Ware to dismiss the case on grounds of state secrets. The plaintiffs had accused the company, based in San Jose, California and Crawley, West Sussex, of helping the CIA transport them to countries where they faced torture and interrogation. The allegations raise the possibility that some of the CIA's rendition flights were planned on British soil. The justice department said a year ago that should the case proceed, it could reveal the CIA's methods in holding and interrogating terrorism suspects, as well as details of the cooperation of foreign governments. The Obama justice department, under attorney general Eric Holder, today reiterated that position, to the disappointment of civil rights campaigners. Saying that Holder had instructed officials to review the \"state secrets\" policy, a justice department spokesman said: \"It is vital that we protect information that, if released, could jeopardize national security. The justice department will ensure the [state secrets] privilege is not invoked to hide from the American people information about their government's actions that they have a right to know. This administration will be transparent and open, consistent with our national security obligations.\" Accusing Obama of turning his back on civil liberties, Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the parties in the case, said: \"This is not change. This is definitely more of the same. Candidate Obama ran on a platform that would reform the abuse of state secrets, but President Obama's justice department has disappointingly reneged on that important civil liberties issue.\" Following last week's high court ruling, the US state department sent a message of thanks to the British government. Campaigners had hoped that the note was pro forma rather than reflecting the position of the new administration. The position articulated today, however, suggests that the new administration intends to follow the Bush policies of protecting the rendition process by invoking national security."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
