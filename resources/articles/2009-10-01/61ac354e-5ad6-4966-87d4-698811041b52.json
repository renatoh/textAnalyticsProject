Lying flat on her tummy, her chin resting on her hands, the new US Open junior champion sighs blissfully in the week she officially launches her professional career. After five years of sacrifice, having left her family in Guernsey at the age of 12 for a lonely life as an aspiring tennis player in America, Watson has finally reached an exhilarating new world. \"I'm thinking nice thoughts now,\" she murmurs as a husky little chuckle curls around her words. \"I'm thinking Del Potro thoughts here.\" On a cold morning in Roehampton, at the Lawn Tennis Association's lavish headquarters on the south-western fringes of London, the 17-year-old sounds warm and fuzzy as she dreams of the tall and powerful 21-year-old Argentinian who was an equally surprising winner at the US Open last month. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro crushed Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, and then overwhelmed Roger Federer to win his first grand slam title. Watson, in less celebrated circumstances, was equally decisive in sweeping aside the reigning Wimbledon girls' champion, Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, 6-2, 6-1 before beating her doubles partner, Yana Buchina, in straight sets. When she was ushered in to meet the press afterwards, just before Del Potro headed out to centre court, Watson exclaimed: \"Isn't this cool!\" That same sincere enthusiasm lights up gloomy old Roehampton. Watson opens her eyes wide when asked about her fascination with her fellow US Open champion. \"I love Del Potro! I was so happy when he won. He's very cool. I like his game because he's different to the other men. He hits the ball very flat. And I like the way he walks. It's very confident. I also like [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga. He's very cute too. I like his aura on court.\" Watson laughs breezily. \"But Del Potro's something else \u2026\" Has she met him? \"Nope. But, when I was in the cafeteria at Flushing Meadows he was there, eating, with his hood up and his head down. I walked very slowly then, just staring at him to see what he was eating and stuff. And then he looked up and saw me. I carried on walking then, fast, but on the inside I was going, 'Yesssss! He looked at me!'\" Watson, alongside the 15-year-old Laura Robson, who won junior Wimbledon last year, represents a new kind of young woman in British tennis. Today, at a \u00a325,000 tournament on the senior Challenger tour, in Glasgow, Watson will be hoping to qualify for the main draw \u2013 having achieved her best result outside of junior tennis earlier this month when she beat the British No4 and world 142, Mel South, at another minor tournament in Barnstaple. After years of miserable failure, Watson and Robson look set to change the face of the women's game in this country. In contrast, Andy Murray cuts a solitary figure at the head of an otherwise paltry line of British men. Has she at least met Murray who, as world No4, is one place higher in the rankings than Del Potro? \"Yesterday,\" Watson blurts out. \"It was here, in the players' lounge. I was faffing round in my bag, trying to get my gear together, and I knew someone had come in but I didn't look up. He was, like, 'Hi, how are you?' I thought 'Oh my God, Andy Murray!' But I played it cool and said, 'I'm good, thanks. And you?' And then he was gone. I was impressed. He didn't have to say hello to me.\" As a former junior US Open champion, Murray realises the significance of Watson's win. But he almost certainly did not know the pressure the Guernsey-born teenager faced. Having lost in the opening round of the girls' tournament at Wimbledon, for the second successive year, Watson's dream of playing professional tennis was slipping away. \"It really was,\" she concedes. \"It was looking likely I'd go to college instead. I was actually playing well but you need the results. I kept trying to think logically and see what was best for my future. I couldn't ruin my college option if I wasn't going to make it on the circuit. But if I'd gone to college it's unlikely I would ever make it. If I'd lost early in New York I might have given myself one more year playing tournaments as an amateur. And if that hadn't worked I would have just gone to college \u2013 to study business. But I like art and maths. The only subject I don't really like is English. I can't write to save my life. I never have any thoughts in my head.\" Watson laughs; but that last statement is obviously untrue. She is bright and thoughtful, and buoyed by an inner confidence that explains why, since 2004, she has flourished at Nick Bollettieri's notoriously tough academy in Florida. \"I ended up playing my quarter- and semi-finals on the same day. It was the best I'd ever played. I concentrated on every point and didn't get tight. I was so switched on. But at the start of the final I was 3-1 down before I knew it. I thought, 'Oh God, I really want to win this!' In the end, I won pretty clearly [6-4, 6-1].\" Watson might have played Robson in the final \u2013 only for the younger Briton to flag in a draining semi against Buchina. \"We played at the same time and, even though I told myself not to do it, I couldn't resist peeping at her score. It would have been great for British tennis if we had both made it to the final but it was probably easier to play Buchina. I'd beaten her before while I'd never played Laura \u2013 who's also a left-hander.\" In the same way that Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin drove each other on, and Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic's Serbian background shapes their rivalry, so Watson and Robson should compete alongside each other for years. Yet the British teenagers are far friendlier than their Belgian and Serbian counterparts. \"We're good friends,\" Watson says, \"and it helps there are two of us. It's not healthy if all the focus is on one player.\" Watson is too candid not to admit her natural ambivalence when, at the age of 14, Robson won junior Wimbledon. \"I definitely had mixed emotions. You think that could have been me \u2013 but she did so well at a young age. In the end it gives you so much motivation. You think, 'If she can do it, so can I.'\" Earlier this month, in Barnstaple, she and Robson played doubles together. \"Our pairing was really good. We both have solid volleys and our games complement each other so I hope I play more with her.\" Do they discuss their joint ambition to rise to the top of the singles ratings and win grand slams? \"Yeah, but in jokey ways. We understand each other.\" Robson is described as the more gifted player, and likelier to emulate Murray, but Watson shows her steel. \"I've got a lot of talent too. We're just developing at different times. When I was 15 I was small and kind of chubby.\" Watson flashes another endearing smile, which can't quite obscure her resilience. Unlike Jankovic and Maria Sharapova, who cried themselves to sleep most nights during their earliest years at Bollettieri's Academy, Watson adapted easily to a testing regime. \"I'm lucky because I'm not the homesick type. I'm very good on my own. So it was easy for me to get stuck in straight away.\" She has also been helped immeasurably by her mum and dad, Michelle and Ian. Apart from funding her in America for five years, they have avoided the usual junior tennis trap of exerting parental pressure. Unlike many \"tennis dads\", Ian Watson has a serious job outside his daughter's world, as the managing director of Guernsey Electricity. Her mother, Michelle, comes from Papa New Guinea, and is the antithesis of the pushy parent. \"It's hard for my dad,\" Watson suggests, \"and he did have tears in his eyes about 18 months ago when they decided it would be best for me if mum came to live with me in Florida. I was starting to travel a lot and it would have been hard for me to go to all these different countries on my own. So I moved out of the academy to live with my mum. It's a step we needed to take and my dad's been great about it. He misses us loads, but we get to talk every day on Skype. He also comes over to the States when he can and we spend about three months a year as a family. It's another sacrifice but we're still a very close family.\" This time next week she will be back at Pendleton High in Florida, and will play two further professional tournaments between her schooling and the Christmas break. \"It's quite a normal school \u2013 even though we're all athletes. We're allowed to go to school either in the morning or the afternoon and fit it around our training schedules. I really like it.\" Watson, with a cheeky grin, revels in the fact that \"the ratio is about seven boys to one girl. That's quite nice!\" Yet, rather than falling for an archetypal high school sports jock, Watson has more rarefied tastes in slightly older men. \"I'm thinking Del Potro again,\" she warns, before casting her net a little wider. \"Nadal's quite good-looking off court. On court he's a bit \u2026 sweaty! Del Potro's much more elegant.\" Asked to close her eyes again, for a last photograph, the young woman dreaming of a brand new life in professional tennis, can't resist a final quip. \"I'm thinking of the moment me and Del Potro made eye contact back in New York. Maybe, one day, he might even know who I am.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
