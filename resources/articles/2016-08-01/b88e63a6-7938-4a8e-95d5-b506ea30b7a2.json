The Scot, by general consensus, has been the best player in the world since he won Wimbledon, where the world No1 crashed out in the third round, but Djokovic has invariably used adversity to reach deep and drag to his aid that special force that enables him to do the impossible. This is such a time of crisis for him. When the tournament opens on Monday the focus on the defending champion will be as fierce as at any time in his career. He starts his fortnight against the Pole Jerzy Janowicz and that is no easy assignment. If Djokovic\u2019s left wrist has healed sufficiently to let him hit freely, he will win. If not \u2013 and if the \u201cprivate issues\u201d he said derailed his calendar grand slam campaign at Wimbledon are lingering \u2013 defeat will not be the surprise that it would seem on the day. John McEnroe, (who has revealed his coaching deal with Milos Raonic is over), told a teleconference on ESPN, the host broadcaster: \u201cNovak said physically he was OK at Wimbledon, but something was going on personally. You can see how that can changed the momentum of the whole year in a way. It looked like he was on his way to the grand slam, had won four [majors] in a row. Now we\u2019re here at the US Open and we\u2019re talking as if Murray is playing the best tennis of everyone. \u201cThe moment Novak lost, it sort of lifted [Murray] and things have shifted a little bit. It just shows you how little it takes. Players are always on their toes. But they have to expect things like that to happen. The key is to sort of regroup as quickly as possible and to be able to maintain that ranking as long as possible.\u201d Murray, who plays Lukas Rosol on Tuesday, could not be more settled. He has a wonderful opportunity to match Djokovic with two slams apiece this year and contemplate chasing him down to the No1 ranking by the end of the year. He oozes contentment. When asked about the whereabouts of his Olympic gold medal, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s in the hotel. I don\u2019t know where exactly.\u201d And, no, he does not constantly look at it, as if it is a genie lamp he can rub to conjure up another wish. \u201cNo, I just had it in my bag during Cincinnati week and when I got here [last Monday], I saw Kim, and I had it out then to show her. I just keep it in my bag.\u201d Of his possessions, if that is not too crude a comparison, their six\u2011month\u2011old daughter, Sophia, is clearly most treasured. Murray was separated from them for three weeks, the longest absence since she was born. And, like most first-time fathers, he is fascinated by the wonder of her development. \u201cThere have been a lot of changes,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s not like one thing she\u2019s doing differently but in 21 days, she is just bigger and more mature. When she\u2019s eating she\u2019s eating better. She\u2019s not dropping it everywhere. Her coordination is a bit better. You don\u2019t notice it when you see a child every day, you don\u2019t see the changes. But when you miss 21 days, you see it. It\u2019s a big change.\u201d Murray has changed, too. He will never break free from those inner forces that produce the occasional explosion under pressure, but he is considerably calmer than even a year ago. It is likely Sophia has a lot to do with that. As he said immediately after the draw on Friday: \u201cTennis isn\u2019t the most important thing in my life any more. Probably when I was younger and didn\u2019t have a family, then it was the most important thing. I think having that different perspective helps a lot, maybe not putting so much pressure on myself. And before a match I\u2019m not stressing as much as I used to.\u201d As Kei Nishikori, whom he beat in the semi-finals in Rio and might have to play in the quarter-finals here, says when asked to compare the fitness of Murray and Djokovic: \u201cI think Andy is 100%. He has a lot of chance to beat Novak. But I think a couple of young guys, Raonic and [Marin] Cilic, are back on track again. It\u2019s going to be a tough tournament.\u201d When was it not? What does change \u2013 and makes the job that much tougher \u2013 is the schedule. Next year, there will be the new Laver Cup, a Europe v the Rest of the World experiment over three days, with three singles and a doubles match each day, mimicking the format of golf\u2019s Ryder Cup. Federer, who is out for the rest of the season undergoing rehabilitation on the knee he twisted in Melbourne at the start of the year, has urged Murray to play. The Scot is sceptical. \u201cI have given it some thought, chatted a bit about it, but the timing is tricky,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be US Open and then the following week is Davis Cup and then the following weekend would be that. If you\u2019re not involved in Davis Cup, it would make it a lot easier, but with the Davis Cup, it\u2019s too much in my opinion.\u201d Towards the end of the best summer of his career, Murray has his eye only on the trophy he lifted four years ago to announce his arrival among the game\u2019s elite. This time, he will not be distracted by either Djokovic\u2019s fitness problems or the fanciful plans for yet another manufactured tournament more than a year away. Sophia, when she grows up, would probably not forgive him. If she is anything like her mother or grandmother, she would be as annoyed as her father if he lost against Rosol on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
