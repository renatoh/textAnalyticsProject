Eligible charities must also have been registered in the UK for more than two years and have an annual income of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a31.5 million. \u201cPeople sometimes ask what we mean by \u2018UK social welfare charities\u2019. The short answer is any eligible registered charity that helps people in Britain and/or Northern Ireland. It can be nationwide or just at community level. It can have a strong environmental theme, or involve animals, but the key thing is that it must deliver clear benefit to people - adults or children - who are disadvantaged by poverty or disability or are marginalised in some other way. If you\u2019re not sure if you qualify, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d David Brindle, public services editor, the Guardian Entries for the Guardian Charity Awards 2015 have now closed See this year\u2019s timeline and frequently asked questions See our terms and conditions"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
