I had also visited Styal twice about a month earlier to see her. On the first of these three visits, I was allowed to see Marie. Two days later, I was barred because a sniffer dog detected opiates on my body. I take a daily cocktail of heart drugs after undergoing a bypass some years ago, but my explanation was of no avail and I was ordered to leave the prison - even though some officers involved in Styal's drug-screening procedure know very well that some kind of opiate ingredient is common in heart medication. Paradoxically, I was taking the same medicine at the time of the first visit but the sniffer dog had not detected it. I arrived for the third of these visits on August 29, armed with a note from my GP explaining my situation, and a repeat prescription. I was allowed to see Marie, but was refused face-to-face contact, having to talk through a glass screen. Since August 5, it seems all medical evidence provided by GPs has been overruled by a new edict from the Home Office. The officers at Styal said they didn't like this Home Office ruling - it was \"a blunt instrument\", they said. Nonetheless, I was shoved into a small, hot and stuffy corridor where I could barely communicate with Marie via a very inadequate audio system which meant we both had to shout. Unlike other visitors, I wasn't allowed to purchase tea from the drinks vending machine during the course of my visit. Some of the pills I take are diuretics making one very thirsty and though my head was swimming and I was fearful of fainting I wasn't allowed a drink. Moreover, I had to constantly lean well over the wooden counter towards the glass partition to make myself heard. Many days afterwards my chest still hurt, as the counter was pressing on my heart-wound area which, after being disturbed like this, produces palpitations and shortage of breath for ages. I am nearly 60 years old, and I know a woman of 80 who also had to undergo the same ordeal. Obviously prison authorities in general must be very pleased at having curbed the nefarious activities of at least two class A drug dealers. At the present moment I am preparing a website for Marie Whiston - whom I and others believe to be innocent of the murder for which she was convicted in 1997. The site will review and present her case and call for a retrial. This means I need open contact with her. Have I to forego my essential medication if I am to proceed, no matter that my life will be put at risk? It is ironic that throughout the last year I've been engaged in a bitter, relentless and fruitless battle with Kensington and Chelsea council over its outright refusal to deal with a particularly dangerous crack and heroin trader and an accomplice tenanted in an adjacent flat and regularly terrorising other tenants, occasionally mugging people in an enclosed corridor where my brother lives. A year ago my brother also underwent a massive heart operation involving more than a heart bypass. On his return from hospital he was forced out of his council home by the drug dealers who intimidated him. He collapsed and was swiftly taken by ambulance to hospital. When he complained to Kensington and Chelsea's housing authorities about his dreadful predicament, they virtually declared war on him for upsetting the peace and tranquility image they were promoting in their glossy brochures. No sniffer dogs were sent down his corridor to confirm the truth of his allegations - possibly because they were otherwise employed detaining near geriatrics down the road at Styal . . . A pathetic attempt by the authorities to curb the dealing of class A drugs in the apartment corridor was so feeble it can only make the dealers even more secure as they ply their hideous trade. Both cases add up to the kind of scenario that would have delighted Orwell: truth is bureaucratic edict and bureaucratic edict is truth. Incidentally, at Styal as in many other prisons, the taking of hard drugs is rife. Some of these seem to come over the wire fence on arranged drops. Yet scapegoats are continually needed and it looks as if - being a visitor whose heart condition requires medication - I'm one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
