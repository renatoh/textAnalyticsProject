Search me", "bodyText": "There\u2019s a segment in John Mulaney\u2019s 2018 comedy special Kid Gorgeous in Radio City in which the American stand-up attempts to grapple with the phenomenon of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency via a prolonged analogy \u2013 delivered in increasingly incredulous tones \u2013 of there being \u201ca horse loose in a hospital\u201d. I find myself in a very similar situation now, with the advent of ITV\u2019s new police drama Wild Bill into our lives. Because, look, I don\u2019t really know how to put this so that you\u2019ll believe me, so I\u2019ll just say it as simply as I can: Wild Bill is ITV\u2019s new drama and it stars Rob Lowe as the new chief constable of East Lincolnshire police. There\u2019s a horse loose in the hospital. Would it help if I added that he plays a former high-flying Miami cop, Bill Hixon, who has relocated to England with his 14-year-old daughter for Reasons Yet Unidentified? Or would that just make things much, much worse? I\u2019ll give you a few moments to try to repair the rips in the space-time continuum this news has created for anyone old enough to remember the heady Brat Pack days when Lowe became a star, appearing in the era-defining likes of St Elmo\u2019s Fire and About Last Night (as well as a leaked sex tape, but perhaps we need not dwell on that). His second act began when he was cast as smooth deputy White House communications director Sam Seaborn in The West Wing and, having proved to have doughty acting chops lurking beneath his screen idol look, he has been busy ever since. And now there\u2019s a horse loose in the hospital. I\u2019m sorry, I mean now he is playing a chief constable, Bill Hixon, here to take charge of the recalcitrant members of the (fictional) East Lincolnshire constabulary in ITV\u2019s new police drama Wild Bill. I may have said that before. I\u2019m just trying to make it real for us all. We first meet Bill in smart tux and battered Volvo as he chases a carful of villains across a cabbage field. They escape. He starts venting his rage on some cabbages and we cut to one week earlier to find out how he got there. I was hoping we would reopen in Lowe\u2019s agent\u2019s office, but no. We arrive at his arrival in Boston, quickly and undeftly established not as the sleepy little town of our collective imaginings but the real one, which has the highest murder rate in England and the worst record of racial and ethnic integration. It\u2019s OK, though, because Bill is a modern cop with modern tools to hand \u2013 namely: algorithms. They crop up a lot over the hour, even if you don\u2019t include the one that must have designed Lowe\u2019s still comically beautiful face. A thief nicking satellite dishes off the council estate? Bill\u2019s got an algorithm for that. \u201cI could police this whole county from Miami Beach with a cellphone and good wifi,\u201d he assures his assembled subordinates. The thief is caught, but in doing so one of the arresting officers notices a semi-naked man keening in front of a fridge that contains the head of a young woman who has been missing for 10 years. Computate that, Miami man! Further down the line, DC Muriel Yeardsley (a rather brilliant comic-where-necessary turn from Bronwyn James) uses another algorithm to reconstruct the movements of the woman\u2019s then-boyfriend Marek (Julian Kostov) when she disappeared. This used to be called basic police work and I am a bit surprised they didn\u2019t do it at the time, but this is one of many points at which the plot of Wild Bill reveals itself to have been created by an all-too-human hand, and so we must accept and move on. No spoilers, but one marijuana farm, a Russian gangster (it\u2019s his minions leading Bill a merry dance among the cabbages), a couple of good lines (\u201cNo one likes a boaster,\u201d says Crime Commissioner Metcalfe when Bill reveals Miami had 150 murders compared with Boston\u2019s 10 the previous year) and an absolutely hilarious denouement atop a wind turbine later, the murder is solved, Bill has decided to stay in Lincolnshire and we can all press pause and take a moment to think about what we have just witnessed. A horse loose in a hospital. If you can avoid getting trampled by the hooves of insanity galloping through it, there\u2019s enough to make Wild Bill a good way to fill the commercial hour. I just never thought I would live long enough to see it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
