Prince William said he would be \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d if they did, but had concerns about the persecution they may face, admitting he had discussed the subject with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge. He also expressed his shock at the recent bus attack on a lesbian couple, saying: \u201cI was really appalled by that attack.\u201d William voiced his concerns during a visit to the London headquarters of the Albert Kennedy Trust (Akt), an LGBT charity in Hoxton, east London, dedicated to helping young people made homeless because of their sexual orientation. He was asked the hypothetical question by a young gay man, who asked not to be identified: \u201cIf your child one day in the future said: \u2018Oh I\u2019m gay, oh I\u2019m lesbian,\u2019 whatever, how would you react?\u201d William replied: \u201cI think you don\u2019t really start thinking about that until you are a parent, and I think \u2013 obviously, absolutely fine by me.\u201d The prince, a father of three, added: \u201cThe one thing I\u2019d be worried about is how, particularly the roles my children fill, how that is going to be interpreted and seen. So Catherine and I have been doing a lot of talking about it to make sure they were prepared.\u201d He added: \u201cIt worries me not because of them being gay; it worries me how everyone else will react and perceive it and the pressure is then on them.\u201d He told another man in the group he had started thinking about it since the births of his children, George, five, Charlotte, four and Louis, one, and it was something he was \u201cnervous about\u201d. \u201cNot because I am worried about them being gay, or anything. It\u2019s more about the fact I\u2019m worried about the pressure \u2013 as you all know - they\u2019re going to face and how much harder their life could be. \u201cI wish we lived in a world where, like you said, it\u2019s really normal and cool. But particularly for my family and the position that we are in, that\u2019s the bit I\u2019m nervous about. \u201cI fully support whatever decision they make, but it does worry me from a parent point of view how many barriers, hateful words, persecution and discrimination that might come. That\u2019s the bit that really troubles me a little bit. \u201cThat\u2019s for all of us to try and help correct, to put that in the past and not come back to that sort of stuff.\u201d Tim Sigsworth, Akt\u2019s chief executive, said the fact that a future monarch would support their children if they came out as LGBT sent \u201ca message to the whole of society\u201d and would \u201cmake a massive difference\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
