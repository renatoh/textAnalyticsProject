It is just that another equally accurate summary of Manchester United\u2019s situation might be that they are hanging on in Europe by a thread after Anfield, have dropped back to sixth in the league and have more or less abandoned hope of a top-four finish, and could be out of the FA Cup by Sunday evening unless they find new reserves of energy and ideas against an in-form and rested West Ham. Van Gaal seemed as shocked as everyone else by the paucity of his side\u2019s display against Liverpool, even if J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team deserved credit for finally packing a punch against opponents they have lately been standing back and admiring. United\u2019s season so far has been one of infuriating inconsistency. Not bad all the time \u2013 though they have certainly been bad at times \u2013 but incapable of putting a run of results together lasting more than three or four matches. No sooner did they beat Arsenal and Watford to move level on points with fourth-placed Manchester City, than they dropped points with an anonymous showing at West Bromwich then blundered into the trap Klopp and his high-pressing system had set for them in Europe. \u201cI have to always keep changing the team,\u201d Van Gaal offered in explanation of United\u2019s mood swings. \u201cI have been unable to play the same lineup in many matches because of injuries or tired players. When you are in three competitions and you don\u2019t have too many players it is difficult. \u201cI agree that the Liverpool game was not one of our best performances but we haven\u2019t been playing like that all season. There are games when we have played better. After the defeat to Midtjylland I was sacked according to the media, but we stood up again in the next match and put a run of wins together. Maybe that could still happen in the second leg with Liverpool, and it is also possible that we can beat West Ham in the FA Cup.\u201d With United at present just about anything might happen, though while Van Gaal may be the sort of coach capable of believing six impossible things before breakfast he probably ought not to be allowed to get away with blaming the latest slump on a shortage of players. Only a couple of weeks ago he introduced Marcus Rashford and Timothy Fosu\u2011Mensah to considerable acclaim; Anthony Martial, Marcos Rojo and Marouane Fellaini have recovered from injury; and even Bastian Schweinsteiger was able to take the field at Anfield, admittedly looking somewhat short of full match fitness. It is true that Wayne Rooney is still unavailable but United spent more than \u00a3100m last summer to assemble a squad of Champions League rather than Europa League strength. Van Gaal talks a lot about his three-year plan so at this critical point in the process, with United in three competitions for the time being but failing to convince in any, how does he think the overhaul is going? \u201cI think it is working, though the circumstances are sometimes difficult and we are not always getting the best results,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not playing well enough to be champions, but it is still possible to win the Europa League or the FA Cup. We have a lot still to fight for. If we go out of one of the cups it is a difficult situation for everyone, but we still have the chance to win something and we have to keep believing we can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
