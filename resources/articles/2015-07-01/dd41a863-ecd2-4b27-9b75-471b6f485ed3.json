News Corp on Wednesday reported that the Speaker claimed a travel allowance of $288 to stay in Brisbane in April 2007 when she attended backbencher Teresa Gambaro\u2019s wedding. A spokesman for Bishop told News Corp the Speaker had met an unnamed academic as part of an parliamentary inquiry into illicit drugs that was held the Monday after the wedding. The website of the standing committee shows that there were no public hearings listed for mid to late April, after Gambaro\u2019s wedding on 15 April. Public hearings resumed in Canberra from 9 May, and the only public hearing in Queensland through the course of the illicit drugs inquiry had already taken place in March. The Australian newspaper reports that a spokesman for Bishop said the Speaker had engaged in a meeting on 16 April with a confidential source in connection to the illicit drugs inquiry. Calls to the Speaker\u2019s office to verify the claims have gone unanswered. The public has \u201cjustifiable angst\u201d on the issue of parliamentary expenses, social services minister Scott Morrison has admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not one to offer public lectures to my colleagues on these things. If I have anything to pass on to the Speaker I will do it privately,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe Speaker is consulting with her colleagues and think that\u2019s the appropriate place for those discussions to take place.\u201d The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was similarly equivocal on supporting the Speaker. \u201cI understand that the Labor party will seek to use this to destabilise question time, for example, and I\u2019m sure Speaker Bishop will take that into account as she considers her position,\u201d Julie Bishop told Channel Nine on Wednesday morning. \u201cBut I believe it\u2019s important that the Department of Finance be able to carry out an investigation. That\u2019s what has happened in the past and that should happen in this case.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, is not ruling out moving a motion of no confidence in the Speaker. \u201cI\u2019ll be amazed if this saga is still carrying on when Parliament resumes, and of course, if that is the case and it\u2019s still carrying on when Parliament resumes then Labor will have plenty to say,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. Bishop has come under fire for claiming $600 for flights to Albury in 2006 when she attended the wedding of the former Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella. The Speaker has insisted she flew to the New South Wales town for a secret meeting in her capacity as chair of the standing committee of family and human services, to meet people who did not wish to appear before a public hearing of an inquiry into work-life balance. A spokesman for Bishop was unable to provide Guardian Australia with the details of how many people she met at the weekend in question when contacted on Tuesday. Other committee members do not remember authorising committee business for the Albury trip. \u201cI can\u2019t recall any reason Bronwyn Bishop would need to be in Albury that weekend but I do absolutely say if there was a reason, if she did go through the proper processes, then there would be documentation and we wouldn\u2019t need to be here speculating about it,\u201d Labor\u2019s education spokeswoman, Kate Ellis, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is up to Tony Abbott and Bronwyn Bishop to put this matter to rest and they should be able to do that very easily by just producing the documents.\u201d The prime minister, Tony Abbott, put Bishop on \u201cprobation\u201d after she claimed $5,277 to take a helicopter trip between Melbourne and Geelong for a Liberal party fundraiser. She was forced to pay back the money, plus a 25% loading for lodging the incorrect claim. Some of Bishop\u2019s colleagues are standing by her. \u201cI do think that Bronwyn Bishop is doing a good job as Speaker of the House,\u201d parliamentary secretary Kelly O\u2019Dwyer told ABC TV on Tuesday night. But she added that the use of taxpayer money has \u201cto be within the rules\u201d. \u201cThe public is rightly very, very upset if they feel that a member of parliament has acted outside of their entitlement,\u201d O\u2019Dwyer said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
