The Arsenal manager recalled Coquelin from his loan spell at Charlton Athletic to answer selection problems and has been rewarded with a series of tenacious displays. Wenger paid tribute to Coquelin in the context of his latest grilling over plans for the upcoming transfer window. \u201cThe world has changed,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe appreciation today of the quality of a player is just down to the money you spend. If we had bought Coquelin at Christmas for \u00a340m, everyone would say, \u2018What a signing.\u2019 I am sorry he didn\u2019t cost any money. He is still a good player.\u201d Wenger refused to comment, as ever, on specific players to whom Arsenal have been linked but he did say that Coquelin\u2019s emergence had not changed the club\u2019s thinking too greatly in terms of recruitment. It is understood that their priority positions are defensive midfield and goalkeeper. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed a lot,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhat is for sure is Coquelin has shown he has the capacity to play for us and play a big part in the success of the team. I think nobody would dispute that his performances have been convincing and that he is ready for a fight \u2013 even if somebody comes in. Even if somebody else comes in, he will stay here. I extended his contract [in February]. That means I believe in him.\u201d Coquelin has been part of an extremely settled team; Wenger has started with the same XI for the past six league matches and, in a quirk, that lineup has excluded English players. The club have made great play of their determination to build around an English core but Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Danny Welbeck have been missing, mainly because of injuries. The first four are now fit but they have encountered frustration at breaking into the team. \u201cI know our future is only bright if I can keep a cohesion and a core of players who have been educated here and play year in, year out together,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThat is the difficulty in the modern job. The cohesion is a very important part of the success of the team but you are always under pressure to get in ... People always want new. We live in a \u2018new world\u2019. The English players will play. People underestimate the fact that when you have been out for a year [like Walcott], it is not in four weeks that you come back.\u201d Arsenal face Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium night, when a point will all but ensure a top-three finish, which would mean direct entry into the Champions League group phase next season. Laurent Koscielny is a doubt because of flu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
