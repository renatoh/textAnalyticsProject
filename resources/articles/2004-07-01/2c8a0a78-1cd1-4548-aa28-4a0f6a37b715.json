Andy Duncan", "bodyText": "Job: chief executive, Channel 4 Age: 41 Industry: broadcasting 2003 ranking: new entry The BBC's director of marketing Andy Duncan was the surprise choice to be the new chief executive of Channel 4. A surprise because he lacks the one thing that every other Channel 4 chief executive had in spades - programme-making experience. But Mr Duncan makes up for his lack of production experience with a vast knowledge of marketing and general management, proving his strategic nous with the successful launch of Freeview and a bunch of the BBC's digital channels. He wasted no time in suggesting he would look to partnerships with other broadcasters and media organisations to \"future proof\" Channel 4. A possible alliance with Channel Five is still on the agenda, as is the possibility of adopting a Guardian-style trust status or a possible link-up with Flextech. \"Together we need to make sure that post-2010 or 2012 or whenever [digital] switchover is completed, Channel 4 is at least as strong if not stronger than today in its reach and share of key audience,\" he declared. The 41-year-old joined the BBC three years ago from Unilever, where he spent 17 years and was responsible for brands such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, PG Tips and Batchelor Supernoodles. He was recommended for the Channel 4 job by former BBC director general Greg Dyke, who described him as one of the best appointments he made during his time at the corporation. His elevation to the role formerly held by Mark Thompson also sent out a clear message from Channel 4's recently installed chairman, Luke Johnson: it's not just about the programmes, stupid. In a fiercely competitive multichannel market, Channel 4's brand is one of its greatest strengths and part of Mr Duncan's job will be to make sure it stays that way. Mr Duncan just pipped Talkback Thames boss Peter Fincham to the role - the latter's background and skills were thought to be too close to those of the Channel 4 director of programmes, Kevin Lygo. At the BBC, Mr Duncan was given the task of selling Freeview to an initially sceptical British public in 2002. He was later promoted to chairman of Freeview, which is the fastest growing digital TV platform in the UK and is now in close to 4 million homes. He was also a key player when the BBC relaunched its digital TV channels and expanded into digital radio in 2002 and 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
