The Saltire Society literary awards gave out a host of prizes at the National Museum of Scotland last weekend. The Scottish fiction book of the year went to Ewan Morrison for his novel Nina X, described by judges as a \u201cgreat feat of imagination, showing digital modernity through the eyes of a young woman emerging from a lifetime within the confines of a Maoist commune\u201d. But Lesley McDowell, who was one of five judges for the fiction award, revealed her resignation in the Scotsman on Monday. She had pushed for Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Booker-shortlisted Ducks, Newburyport \u2013 which took the Goldsmiths prize last month, acclaimed as \u201ca masterpiece\u201d \u2013 and said she had been backed by one other judge. But according to McDowell, two of the three judges against Ellmann winning admitted they hadn\u2019t finished the 1,000-page novel \u2013 a statement that has been strongly contested by the Saltire Society. Eventually, Morrison\u2019s novel was chosen by a vote of three to two. \u201cAt this point, I said I couldn\u2019t support the choice because it was a woman written by a man, when there were three women who\u2019d written women on the shortlist and that meant they were saying a man had written a woman better than these three,\u201d McDowell told the Guardian. \u201cI said they had to be very sure that their choice stood up against all of that, and that because I did not think it did, therefore couldn\u2019t support it,\u201d she said. In a judging meeting, she cited research by the author Nicola Griffith, which found that books about women by women were least likely to win literary awards, and to VIDA\u2019s annual analysis of critical culture, which consistently shows male authors are more likely to be reviewed. \u201cI was asked if I would never vote for a man, and so had to explain that of course men can and should write women. My own husband\u2019s last book was a woman\u2019s point of view, and half of my last one was from a man\u2019s. But in these circumstances, gender choice matters,\u201d said McDowell. \u201cEvery year the Women\u2019s prize has to answer the same question, why do we need a prize for women? Well, the answer was right in this meeting. A woman was being overlooked, her book not even finished.\u201d Ellmann herself told the Observer on Sunday that there was \u201ca tinge of sexism in certain male reviewers\u2019 comments on the book\u2019s length \u2026 They\u2019re probably further miffed that it\u2019s a novel about womanhood. The feeling is, how dare a woman, the narrator or the author, take up so much of my time?\u201d she said. McDowell said that none of the Saltire\u2019s fiction panel had read all of the shortlisted titles in their entirety. One of the shortlisted books, Ruairidh MacIlleathain\u2019s C\u00f2ig Duilleagan na Seamraig, is in Gaelic, but only one of the judges speaks Gaelic. The shortlist also included Bird Summons by Leila Aboulela, You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr and Tiger by Polly Clark. McDowell said she asked Saltire to remove her name from the prize. Ellmann\u2019s publisher, Sam Jordison at Galley Beggar Press, described the situation as \u201can awful mess\u201d, adding that \u201cit does feel like lightning striking twice for Ducks\u201d. Jordison wrote at length in the Times Literary Supplement criticising the Booker judges\u2019 decision to choose two winners this year, neither of whom were Ellmann. \u201cIt\u2019s fine not to win when procedures have been followed properly and reasonably. But when they haven\u2019t, it feels unjust,\u201d he said. He said he admired McDowell\u2019s decision to go public. \u201cIt can\u2019t have been easy, but there has to be accountability when these things go wrong and we need truth-tellers like her. I\u2019m still hopeful someone will tell us what the hell happened with the Booker and she\u2019s setting a brave example,\u201d he said. The judging panel for the Saltire prize also included Rosemary Ward, director of programmes at the Scottish Book Trust, Ali Bowden, director of Edinburgh Unesco City of Literature Trust, poet Ken Cockburn and reviewer Alasdair McKillop. Speaking on behalf of the prize, Sarah Mason said: \u201cThe Saltire Society and the judges of the fiction award reaffirm that all judges carefully examined all texts submitted for the award. The judges were selected based on their expertise, knowledge and integrity and stand by their decision to award the prize to Nina X. Although only one panel member is a Gaelic speaker all Gaelic books are put to further scrutiny by an independent panel and fully evaluated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
