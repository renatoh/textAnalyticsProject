The investor action group Market Forces says both ANZ and Westpac poured significant new money into fossil fuel projects during 2018-19 in a way that indicated the banks\u2019 lofty climate goals were not being factored into individual investment decisions. Market Forces has previously raised concern that while the major banks appeared to have tempered their investment in coal, they continued to aggressively fund the expansion of the oil and gas industry. Westpac\u2019s own figures show its overall exposure to fossil fuels has decreased by 16% year-on-year, and its total investment in renewable projects had increased by the same amount. But those figures provide a snapshot of the bank\u2019s total loan book, including many longstanding positions, rather than investments made during the past financial year. Market Forces\u2019 analysis of Westpac\u2019s lending, comparing last calendar year to the previous year, shows an 8% increase to investment in the fossil fuel sector. Figures released by ANZ last week show the bank\u2019s total fossil fuel investments increased by 9%. Market Forces\u2019 executive director, Julien Vincent, said there was a clear disconnect between statements made by major banks on climate and their subsequent investment decisions. He said the Commonwealth Bank was the only institution whose annual investment in fossil fuels had decreased every year since 2016. \u201cIf the position of banks is clear that it will not lend to companies that are expanding the fossil fuel industry, then that position should filter down to the decision-making practice. It\u2019s clearly not,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cOverall it\u2019s a pretty ugly story. You can\u2019t take those comments [about climate-friendly policies] seriously when they\u2019re doing the opposite, when the evidence is there the banks are not managing their climate exposure.\u201d Vincent said Westpac\u2019s backing of oil and gas company Woodside, including plans in the Browse Basin, was particularly concerning, given its ability to help develop a largely untapped conventional gas resource off the Western Australia coast. \u201cWe\u2019ve observed Westpac\u2019s exposure go down before, but it\u2019s not been consistent. We need the policies and the leadership to be clear. They need to trend in one direction.\u201d Vincent said ANZ still backed pure-play coalminer Whitehaven, whose strategy is based on a scenario where the world miserably fails to limit global heating to the Paris targets. \u201cANZ still has a coal policy from 2015,\u201d Vincent said. Westpac pointed to its sustainability performance report that showed its total exposure to fossil fuel mining projects had decreased, comparing September 2018 to September 2019. It also showed lending to renewables had grown to three times the bank\u2019s investment in fossil-fuel energy generation. \u201cWe recognise that we have an important role in supporting companies to transition to a net zero economy,\u201d Westpac said in a statement. \u201cOur climate change position statement sets out our policies in this area and further information regarding our climate change governance, strategy and risk management approach is available in our reporting.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted ANZ for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
