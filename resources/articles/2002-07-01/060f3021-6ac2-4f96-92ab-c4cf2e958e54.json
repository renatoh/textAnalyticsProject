He took the decision after a meeting in Edinburgh with officials from the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland (CGCS), which had asked him to explain a Sunday Mail report which also alleged that the team's weightlifting coach John McNiven had failed a drug test in the past. The CGCS decided there was \"no case to answer\" as far as McNiven is concerned but, because of the publicity, he has decided to step down along with Ferguson. A statement issued by the Scotland team read: \"CGCS take matters of this nature very seriously and have formally requested that the Sunday Mail make the tapes available to them in order that they can make a full and thorough investigation into the allegations. We recognise this may take some time. In view of the fact that the games start on July 26 the needs of the weightlifting team must take priority.\" The Janine Whitlock saga has already ensured that doping is high on the agenda and the odds are that there will be more damaging drugcases as the organisers conduct more than 1,000 tests during the 10 days of competition. They will include a significant number designed to detect erythropoietin (EPO), the blood-boosting drug which was made infamous following police raids on the 1998 Tour de France. It will be the first time that blood and urine tests will be conducted en masse for one of the most insidious and dangerous performance-enhancing substances. The tests will be conducted by the organisers, the Commonwealth Games Federation, said Dr Brian Sando, head of its medical commission. The World Anti-Doping Agency has also been conducting out-of-competition controls in advance of the games. \"The world of sport is coming together with a unified position to stamp out this scourge,\" said Mike Fennell, the federation chairman. The announcement came after the swimmer Ian Thorpe, arguably the most high-profile participant in Manchester, had complained about the lack of EPO testing at the games. Dr Sando confirmed that the EPO tests will be directed at endurance athletics, triathlon, cycling and swimming. \"There is no point in testing lawn bowlers for EPO,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
