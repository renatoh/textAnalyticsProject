Robson was hired as international football consultant to help Steve Staunton but is unable to attend the Euro 2008 qualifiers over the next week as he recovers from surgery to remove a brain tumour. He missed the previous two matches for medical reasons. \"Any future Bobby will have with us will be based solely on medical advice,\" said Delaney, who plans to visit Robson on Thursday or Friday. \"He is a terrific individual and has fantastic enthusiasm for the game. \"I have spoken to him once or twice since his recent illness. We will see how he is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
