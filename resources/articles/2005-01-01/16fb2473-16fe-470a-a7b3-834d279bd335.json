Elena Cosentino, who worked for the US news broadcaster as a producer and reporter for six years, told an industrial tribunal she felt under \"constant, constant pressure\" to return to work despite suffering from clinical depression after her fiance's death in July 2002. Ms Cosentino, who is seeking \u00a3190,000 in compensation, was made redundant by CNN in March 2004, almost two years after her fiance was killed. CNN is contesting the case. Under cross-examination from Gavin Mansfield, representing CNN, Ms Cosentino said she had been visited by her immediate boss prior to Christmas 2002 and told that she either had to return to work before a January 15 date stipulated on her doctor's note or face the prospect of losing her job. Earlier the court heard how Ms Cosentino had written to CNN's human resources department complaining that \"four years\" of working night shifts had left her feeling ill, comparing the effect of her shift patterns to \"travelling to LA four times a week and never seeing the sun\". After being put under \"relentless\" pressure to return to producing a CNN magazine show, she claimed she was visited by her immediate boss, Jeff Nathenson, and told that she must come back before Christmas as the show had been commissioned. \"I was completely distraught at the time and he came and said if you don't come back before Christmas we will give your job permanently to someone else.\" Mr Mansfield denied the claim, saying that Mr Nathenson had merely enquired as to \"how you felt about coming back and helping out on the show\". \"I accept he talked about arrangements for Design360 but suggest that he did so in terms not as firm as an ultimatum,\" said Mr Mansfield. Earlier the court heard from Dr Alessandra Dei-Cas, a former flatmate of Ms Cosentino's, who told the three-man tribunal that the former CNN producer had almost lost the will to live after her fiance's death. \"She deteriorated pretty soon after Mark's death. At that time even if you weren't a doctor you could tell that there was something seriously wrong and that she needed help.\" Dr Dei-Cas later described how Ms Cosentino sunk into a depression that left her \"sitting on the couch for six months staring at the walls and doing nothing\". The tribunal heard that in her statement Dr Dei-Cas said she advised Ms Cosentino's against going back to work early. \"In theory going back to work was a good idea, but in practice she was very weak. You only had to look at her to see just how impossible it was to go from lying on a couch every day to making a programme.\" The case continues next week. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
