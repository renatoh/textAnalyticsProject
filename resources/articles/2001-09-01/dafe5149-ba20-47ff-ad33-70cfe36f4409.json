The two grocery groups have been lobbying hard for inclusion in the index, which is a tool for investors to track the performance of socially responsible companies. They had been deeply embarrassed at their exclusion, which ranked them alongside tobacco, armaments and nuclear power companies - BAT, Rolls Royce and BAe among them. In total, 34 FTSE-100 companies were excluded. The grocery chains were particularly offended as their arch rival Sainsbury was on the list of \"clean\" companies. Tesco has held meetings with the index compilers in an effort to restore its good name. The company, which was judged to be not environmentally friendly, has recently launched a corporate and social responsibility website to spell out its green credentials. A spokesman said: \"We would be surprised if we were not included now.\" He denied the website was a kneejerk reaction designed to win approval: \"We published a CSR plan two years ago, and haven't just knocked it together over the past couple of months.\" However, Tesco's chances could have been scuppered by a court case last week when the grocer pleaded guilty to dumping old trolleys in a river. The chain was fined \u00a330,000 at Chelmsford crown court and faces \u00a37,500 costs after pleading guilty to knowing and permitting the trolleys to be dumped in the River Chelmer. A spokesman for Safeway, which was blacklisted on the grounds that it did not have a clearly-stated equal opportunities policy, said: \"We hope to be included this time. We registered a protest that we weren't included the first time around. They said we didn't have an equal opportunities policy, despite it being clearly spelled out in our annual report. Now we hope we have resolved the uncertainty.\" The launch of the indices provoked considerable controversy. Environmental and human rights campaigners criticised the inclusion of certain oil and drugs companies. Organisations such as Royal Bank of Scotland were left red faced by the decision of the Ethical Investment Research Service, to exclude them from the lists. Many of those left out have been desperately seeking to persuade Eiris to admit them at this month's review. According to the FTSE there has been huge interest in ethical investment.\"It is the biggest response we have ever had to an index launch and people are talking about socially responsible investment much more than they did before,\" said a FTSE spokeswoman. Royal Bank of Scotland is also confident of coming in from the cold. The bank, which has investments in Indonesia, was excluded by Eiris on human rights grounds but it says the decision was the result of a \"glitch\" in the way information was compiled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
