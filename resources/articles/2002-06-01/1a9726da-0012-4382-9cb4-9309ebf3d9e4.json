Others can dip into their fancy sweetmeats but nothing tickles west country tastebuds quite like beating the neighbours to a nice, shiny trophy. For if the Zurich Championship grand final blatantly fails to do what it says on the tin, Gloucester's pride in securing their first prize of any real magnitude since 1978 was genuine enough. \"I've lost to Harlequins by 70-odd points, I've been hammered by Bath countless times. . .people outside the club don't know what this means,\" explained their captain Phil Vickery, banging the table with his fist for emphasis. \"No one can say it was fluke. We've come here and we've won. That's our trophy, in our clubhouse, in our cabinet.\" He may first have to buy a hammer, and some wood and nails. Moreover the Kingsholm club will now be seeded second behind Leicester among the six English representatives in next season's Heineken Cup, an achievement for which their new director of rugby Nigel Melville and his more volatile predecessor Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 deserve credit. Melville already looks to be in his element, delighting in the company of fans who share his own rugby passion. He believes it is up to three to four clubs to challenge Leicester's consistent dominance but Gloucester's muscular squad look as well-equipped as any. While Saturday's game saw neither side remotely at their best, the key Gloucester men did just enough with exhaustion snapping at their heels. The prolific fly-half Ludovic Mercier kicked seven penalties, the first from his own half via the crossbar, the flanker Jake Boer capped a typically effective day with his side's only try, but nothing much penetrated the midfield. Bristol, for their part, needed Felipe Contepomi to have another blinder but instead the Argentina fly-half was a flickering presence, as if weighed down by his country's footballing travails. Second-half tries by Agustin Pichot and Paul Johnstone, even so, kept the outcome in doubt until deep into injury time when Contepomi, in the game's final move, broke thrillingly clear only to be recalled for a marginal obstruction by Julian White. Fair play to Gloucester, then, but if England Rugby Ltd want to demonstrate it has the national team's best interests at heart it will use the short summer break to rethink next year's Zurich Championship, currently scheduled for the same daft slot in the calendar. The sponsors, truth to tell, would garner far more in the way of positive coverage if they offered to suspend the event as a patriotic gesture in World Cup year, even if it did cost the Premiership clubs around \u00a3180,000 apiece. There is nothing wrong with the vision of a season-ending showpiece; as things stand, unfortunately, there was a bigger Twickenham crowd to watch the Army v Royal Navy game. Gloucester may have some thing to show for their perspiration but the dominant emotion as the final curtain descended was weary relief. \u00b7 Biarritz beat Agen 25-22 after extra-time to win the French championship final.
