France plans to prioritise the most fragile and exposed groups in early 2021, followed by a second campaign for the rest of the population between April and June, the president Emmanuel Macron announced. Germany has already said it is hoping to launch its immunisation drive in the first quarter of 2021 and is preparing vaccination centres across the country. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it would hold an extraordinary meeting on 29 December \u201cat the latest\u201d to consider emergency approval for a vaccine developed by Germany\u2019s BioNTech and US giant Pfizer. Hopes that shots could be ready for use by the end of this year received a boost when US firm Moderna said it was filing Monday for emergency authorisation of its vaccine in the United States and Europe. The EMA said it would hold a separate meeting to assess that request by 12 January at the latest. Large-scale trial data released last month showed that both vaccines were safe and around 95 percent effective against Covid-19. European Commission spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker told reporters that once the EMA gave regulatory permission, formal authorisation from Brussels would follow \u201cvery quickly\u201d, probably \u201cin a matter of days\u201d. Brazil will give priority to the elderly, health workers and indigenous people for vaccination against Covid-19, the health ministry said on Tuesday, unveiling a four-stage preliminary plan for national immunisation. The ministry said in a statement that a final plan would depend on the vaccines that become available. ESwatini\u2019s prime minister Ambrose Dlamini, who tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago, has been transferred to a hospital in neighbouring South Africa for further treatment, the tiny absolute monarchy\u2019s government said on Tuesday. The country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Themba Masuku, said in a statement Dlamini was moved to \u201cguide and fast track his recovery\u201d. The southern African nation of around 1.2 million people has so far recorded 6,419 positive cases, with 122 confirmed deaths, according to the World Health Organization. New Covid-19 infections in France stayed below 10,000 for the third day in a row on Tuesday, a sequence unseen since mid-September, and the number of people hospitalised resumed a downward trend. The government has loosened its second national coronavirus lockdown, put in place on 30 October, by allowing all shops to reopen at the weekend. The French president Emmanuel Macron said last week the lockdown could be lifted on 15 December if by then the number of new cases per day fell to 5,000 and the number of patients in intensive care declined to between 2,500 and 3,000. Earlier in the day, Macron said that France should be in a position to embark on a broader Covid-19 vaccination campaign between April and June next year, after initially targeting a smaller group of people. Health authorities reported 8,083 new cases over the past 24 hours on Tuesday, versus 4,005 on Monday and 9,784 on Sunday. The seven-day moving average of daily new infections fell below 11,000 for the first time since 2 October, at 10,965, four times lower than the all-time high of 54,440 reached on 7 November. The cumulative number of Covid-19 cases now totals 2,230,571, the fifth-highest in the world. After increasing by 90 between Sunday and Monday, the number of people hospitalised for the disease fell by 619 to 27,639, below 28,000 for the first time since 4 November. The number of patients in ICUs declined by 146 to 3,605. The number of people in France who have died from Covid-19 rose by 775 to 53,506, versus a rise of 406 on Monday. But the seven-day moving average of daily additional deaths stood at 467, below 500 for the first time in more than three weeks. Prime minister Boris Johnson suffers biggest Commons revolt since election as MPs back new Covid tiers by 291 to 78. Follow on the UK blog Here\u2019s a quick recap of all the latest coronavirus developments across the globe from the last few hours: BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna file for EU approval of Covid-19 vaccine. Germany\u2019s BioNTech and its US partner, Pfizer, have applied for EU regulatory approval for their Covid-19 vaccine, raising hopes that the first jabs could be administered in December. If approved, the vaccine could potentially be rolled out \u201cin Europe before the end of 2020\u201d, the companies said in a statement. US biotech company Moderna said it had also sought regulatory approval for its Covid-19 shot in both the US and Europe. Belgian police arrest 25 men including MEP as \u2018sex party\u2019 breaks curfew. A Hungarian MEP in Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rightwing party, spotted fleeing along a gutter to escape police raiding a \u201csex party\u201d above a Brussels bar, has apologised for breaching Belgium\u2019s lockdown rules. J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer was one of about 20 people, mainly men and including at least two EU diplomats, who attended a party held near the Grand Place on Friday evening. Lewis Hamilton tests positive for Covid-19 and will miss F1 Sakhir GP. The driver is \u201cdevastated\u201d to miss Sunday\u2019s Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting coronavirus. Hamilton tested positive the day after winning the Bahrain GP and is in isolation. His participation in the final race of the season at Abu Dhabi remains in the balance.

Turkey\u2019s coronavirus death toll hits record for ninth consecutive day. Turkey\u2019s daily Covid-19 death toll hit a record high for a ninth consecutive day on Tuesday, with 190 fatalities in the last 24 hours, as Turks braced for new restrictive measures to curb the spread of the pandemic. Concerns in Ireland as shopping sprees follow Covid lockdown. Ireland emerged from maximum Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday, prompting pre-dawn shopping sprees and appeals to the public to stay vigilant against infection. Austria set to bow to pressure on Covid risk with ski holiday ban. Austria\u2019s government appears to have bowed to pressure from Germany, France and Italy and will ban skiing holidays over the Christmas break in an attempt to control the coronavirus pandemic. The decision, expected to be officially announced on Wednesday, follows heated disagreements between Berlin and Vienna. That\u2019s all from me, Jessica Murray, my colleague Lucy Campbell will be taking over shortly. Securing a coronavirus vaccine for all European countries will be a top priority for Portugal when it takes over the presidency of the EU next January, Portuguese prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa has said. \u201cWe must guarantee we have a vaccine available which is effective in stopping Covid and which permits us to reach on the same day all countries of Europe,\u201d Costa said at a news conference with the European council president, Charles Michel. US president-elect Joe Biden said any coronavirus relief legislation passed before he takes office in January is \u201cjust a start\u201d. Biden said his team is working on a relief package his administration will roll out after he takes office. A longtime museum director dubbed the grande dame of the Russian art world has died at 98, prompting an outpouring of grief and admiration for the woman who brought the Mona Lisa to Moscow and returned masterpieces hidden for decades from the Soviet public to her museum\u2019s exhibition halls. Irina Antonova, whose work at the Pushkin Museum began under Joseph Stalin and ended under Vladimir Putin, died on Monday evening of complications from the coronavirus. Her death was confirmed by the press service of the museum, where she served as director for 52 years from 1961 to 2013. A Hungarian MEP in Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rightwing party, spotted fleeing along a gutter to escape police raiding a \u201csex party\u201d above a Brussels bar, has apologised for breaching Belgium\u2019s lockdown rules. J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, a senior member of the Fidesz party who helped write Hungary\u2019s constitution in 2011, was one of about 20 people, mainly men and including at least two EU diplomats, who attended a party held near the Grand Place in the Belgian capital\u2019s historical centre on Friday evening. The MEP had attempted to escape the scene by climbing out of a window from the first floor apartment before being spotted by a passerby \u201cfleeing along the gutter\u201d, according to Sarah Durant, a spokeswoman for the Brussels region\u2019s deputy public prosecutor. \u201cThe man\u2019s hands were bloody,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing. Narcotics were found in his backpack. The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence, where he identified himself as SJ (1961) by means of a diplomatic passport.\u201d It was reported he tried to claim diplomatic immunity. In a statement, Sz\u00e1jer, 59, who resigned on Sunday without mentioning his brush with the law, apologised for his \u201cirresponsible\u201d behaviour but denied carrying drugs. France will take measures to stop skiers from sidestepping local virus restrictions and hitting the slopes in other countries during the Christmas holidays, the president, Emmanuel Macron, has said. Downhill skiing is effectively banned in France for the season to help contain the spread of Covid-19 after the government said last week that ski lifts would remain closed until January, even though resorts could otherwise operate. Slopes are open in neighbouring Switzerland, tempting French winter sports lovers to cross the border from 15 December, when the current partial lockdown is lifted. \u201cIf there are countries that keep their resorts open, there will be controls to dissuade the French,\u201d Macron told a news conference. This was to avoid \u201ccreating a situation in which there is an imbalance with stations in France\u201d, he said. Switzerland \u2013 not an EU member, though it has strong ties to the bloc \u2013 has ignored calls to fall into line, much to the frustration of French officials. \u201cIn Switzerland, we can go skiing, with protection plans in place,\u201d Swiss health minister Alain Berset said last week. France\u2019s ski resorts have been up in arms over the ban, saying the weeks around Christmas and New Year are crucial for their survival since they account for up to a quarter of their annual revenues. France\u2019s winter sport sector says it generates some \u20ac11bn ($13bn) in revenues a year and employs 120,000 people during the season. Queen Elizabeth II, who has spent much of the coronavirus outbreak in self-isolation because of her age, will forego her traditional family Christmas, the royal household said. The 94-year-old monarch and her husband Prince Philip normally spend the festive season at her Sandringham estate in eastern England with other members of the family. \u201cHaving considered all the appropriate advice, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have decided that this year they will spend Christmas quietly in Windsor,\u201d the royal household said, referring to a castle west of London. The Queen postponed public engagements and moved from her official residence in the British capital to Windsor on 19 March as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Britain has seen more than 59,000 deaths from nearly 1.6m cases. Prince Philip, who turned 99 on 10 June, has been in poor health in recent years and spent four nights in hospital last December for an unspecified pre-existing condition. Their eldest son Prince Charles and his son Prince William have both isolated after showing mild Covid symptoms. The Queen made a rare televised address to the nation in early April calling on Britons to summon the \u201cBlitz spirit\u201d of the second world war to get through the months-long lockdown. Her weekly meeting with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been conducted by telephone. She was seen at a scaled-back, socially distanced Trooping the Colour parade in the grounds of Windsor on 13 June \u2013 the first time it has been staged at the castle since 1895. Also at Windsor in July, she knighted Captain Tom Moore, a 100-year-old second world war veteran who raised millions of pounds for health charities in a sponsored walk of his garden. Her first public appearance outside one of her homes \u2013 where she has a reduced household staff known as HMS Bubble \u2013 was on 16 October, when she visited the Porton Down research laboratory with grandson William. Pakistan has approved $150m in funding to buy Covid-19 vaccines, initially to cover the most vulnerable 5% of the population, the de facto health minister said. The initial phase of vaccinations would focus on providing free shots for frontline health workers and people above the age of 65, Faisal Sultan said, adding the go-ahead for funding the programme had been given at a cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister, Imran Khan. A panel of experts was compiling a list of recommendations on how to procure the vaccine, Sultan, the prime minister\u2019s special adviser on health, said. \u201cWe will see whether we need to tap more than one source, including some western manufacturers or some Chinese, so we will move forward with all these options,\u201d he said. In making a choice, consideration would be given to the vaccine\u2019s efficacy, level of protection and safety, Sultan said, as well as \u201ccold chain\u201d storage requirements and Pakistan\u2019s ability to acquire stocks. An initial conversation has already been opened with several companies, he added. Pakistan has launched phase III clinical trials for CanSino Biologics\u2019 Covid-19 vaccine candidate, led by the government-run National Institute of Health (NIH) and pharmaceutical company AJM - the local representative of CanSino. The South Asian nation of 220 million people closed schools to curb new infections and a rise in the number Covid-19 patients at hospitals in late November. Pakistan\u2019s government reported 67 deaths, the highest single day toll in months, and 2,458 new cases on Tuesday, with 2,165 patients in hospitals in a critical condition. Overall there have been 400,482 cases recorded in the country so far and 8,091 deaths. Covid-19 patients who received cancer treatments that suppress their immune system may remain contagious and able to spread the coronavirus for two months or more, according to a study published on Tuesday. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that when patients have compromised immune systems, healthcare workers follow extra precautions such as wearing respirators instead of face masks and isolate patients for up to 20 days after symptoms appear. In the new study, researchers analysed sputum and swab samples from 20 immunosuppressed cancer patients infected with the coronavirus. They found three were contagious for more than three weeks after their symptoms began, including one who remained contagious for 61 days. The three patients had received either a stem-cell transplant or therapy with genetically engineered immune cells called CAR T-cells within the previous six months. Two of the three had developed severe Covid-19. None of them had antibodies to the virus. Current public health recommendations for Covid-19 patients with weak immune systems are based on limited data and may need to be revised, the researchers said in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cWe know from several studies that if you\u2019re ... healthy, you are no longer infectious after the first week of illness. But there is very little we know about immunocompromised patients,\u201d said Mini Kamboj, one of the study\u2019s authors from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \u201cIs that 20 days enough or do we need to exercise precautions for longer than that?\u201d While only a small proportion of cancer patients with Covid-19 are likely to remain contagious for prolonged periods, \u201cit\u2019s a residual risk that we need to address,\u201d Kamboj said. \u201cWe need to keep an open mind about how (much) longer immunocompromised patients could pose an infection risk to others.\u201d The US government has invited vaccine manufacturers, drug distributors and government officials to a Covid-19 Vaccine Summit next week, Stat News reported. The meeting, which is scheduled for 8 December, will feature president Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and private sector executives, the report said. The meeting would take place days ahead of reviews of vaccine candidates from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech by two separate panels of outside experts to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Industry officials familiar with the plans for the summit interpreted it as an opportunity for the White House to pressure the FDA to quickly issue emergency use authorisations for the two vaccines candidates, the Stat report said. Invitees include Pfizer, Moderna and drug distributors, pharmacies, and logistics companies including McKesson, Walgreens, CVS Health, United Parcel Service , and FedEx, the report said. Italy reported 785 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday, up from 672 on Monday, and 19,350 new infections, compared with 16,377 the day before. Italy has seen 56,361 Covid-19 fatalities, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain\u2019s. It has also registered 1.62 million cases to date. There were 182,100 swabs carried out in the past day, up from a previous 130,524. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 stood at 32,811 on Tuesday, down 376 on the day before. The number in intensive care decreased by 81 and now stands at 3,663. When Italy\u2019s second wave of the epidemic was accelerating fast in the first half of November, hospital admissions were rising by around 1,000 per day, while intensive care occupancy was increasing by about 100 per day. The British government will make a one-off payment of \u00a31,000 ($1,335) to pubs that cannot open due to coronavirus restrictions, but industry leaders said it will not be enough to save many establishments, a treasured part of the national heritage. Nearly 60% of England will be under Tier 2 restrictions when a national lockdown lifts on Wednesday, meaning pubs can only serve alcohol with a substantial meal, effectively keeping those that do not serve food in lockdown. Prime minister Boris Johnson announced that pubs in England that do not serve food would receive the payment in December in recognition of the hit they will take in what is usually their busiest month. Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour party, described the \u00a31,000 payment as \u201cthe definition of small beer\u201d. Hospitality sector leaders were also critical. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous you can have a pint in a theatre, concert hall, cinema or sports ground without a substantial meal, but not the pub. It is a slap in the face of pubs and brewers,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the system would make nine out of 10 hospitality businesses unviable by the new year. \u201cA one-off payment of \u00a31,000 for pubs forced to close does not even count as a token gesture,\u201d she said. The rules have sparked confusion over what constitutes a substantial meal, with attention focused on the status of the Scotch Egg - a hardboiled egg wrapped in meat and breadcrumbs. After some debate over whether it was a meal, a starter or a bar snack, senior minister Michael Gove said told ITV it was a substantial meal and said \u201cI myself would definitely scoff a couple of Scotch Eggs if I had the chance\u201d. He had earlier told LBC radio that a \u201ccouple of Scotch Eggs is a starter, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u201d. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own rules on coronavirus restrictions. Welsh pubs will not be able to serve alcohol at all from Friday. Britain has reported 13,430 new Covid-19 cases and 603 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, both up on Monday\u2019s tallies, according to government data. Turkey\u2019s daily Covid-19 death toll hit a record high for a ninth consecutive day on Tuesday, with 190 fatalities in the last 24 hours, as Turks braced for new restrictive measures to curb the spread of the pandemic. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced new measures on Monday to combat the surge in cases and deaths, including introducing a weekday curfew and a full lockdown at weekends. The number of new coronavirus cases, including asymptomatic ones, recorded over the past 24 hours stood at 30,110. Total deaths rose to 13,936, but historical data on total cases is not available, as Turkey only reported symptomatic cases for four months. It began reporting all cases last Wednesday. A bipartisan group of US senators and members of the House of Representatives have proposed a $908bn (\u00a3676bn) Covid relief bill that would fund measures through to 31 March, including $228bn in additional pay protection funds for hotels, restaurants and other small businesses. State and local governments would receive direct aid under the bipartisan bill, the lawmakers said. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican, said the plan contains $560bn in \u201crepurposed\u201d funding from the Cares Act enacted in March. US airlines would receive $17bn for four months of payroll support under the proposal, Reuters has reported. The bill, which does not yet have support of the White House or Congressional leaders, sets aside $45bn for the US transportation sector, including airlines, airports, buses and Amtrak, Reuters adds. Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, will continue to test a two full dose regimen of the shot despite it showing a lower success rate than a half and full dose regimen in pivotal trials, a top executive told Reuters. The British drugmaker has said its Covid-19 vaccine could be up to 90% effective if administered as a half dose followed by a full dose, but some scientists have questioned the robustness of that result because only a few thousand people were given that regimen in late-stage UK trials. The global trials showed the efficacy rate of the shot was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants in trials in Britain and Brazil. AstraZeneca has said it is likely to run an additional global trial to evaluate the lower dose regimen. SII, which is currently running trials in India testing the safety of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine as well as the immune response it triggers, has no plans currently to alter them to include the half dose-full dose regimen, according to Dr Suresh Jadhav, an executive director at SII. \u201cAnything which is beyond 50% is always going to be a plus, plus,\u201d Jadhav said in an interview on Monday, referring to efficacy rates. He added that changing the dose regimen now would delay the trials. A combination of two different measures could also complicate rapid distribution efforts, according to Jadhav, who has worked on vaccines for more than four decades. \u201cWhen it is one common dose it becomes very easy. Whether it is the first dose, or second it is the same vaccine, same dose,\u201d he said. Over the weekend, SII said it planned to apply for an emergency use licence for the vaccine in India in the next two weeks. The 62% efficacy rate on AstraZeneca\u2019s broader two full dose trial is above the 50% that US regulators say is the minimum required to consider a drug for emergency authorisation. SII, based in the western city of Pune, is the world\u2019s top manufacturer of vaccines by volume. Beyond AstraZeneca, it has also partnered with other companies to potentially manufacture their shots, including the US biotech firm Codagenix, its rival Novavax and Austria\u2019s Themis. But in the global race to develop vaccines to beat the pandemic, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is one of the frontrunners despite having lower efficacy rates than some rivals. US drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna said their coronavirus vaccines have an efficacy rate of 95% and 94.5% respectively but AstraZeneca\u2019s drug is cheaper and easier to transport because it can be stored for long periods at normal fridge temperatures. Those advantages are particularly important for many developing countries and, therefore, for SII. As part of a deal outlined in June, AstraZeneca has licensed SII to supply 1bn doses of its vaccine to dozens of low and middle-income nations. Most of the nations that are part of the Covax initiative, which has been set up to provide Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries, have indicated they would accept and use a proven vaccine, if it showed more than 50% efficacy, according to Jadhav. Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of SII, said affordability, scalability and ease of storage and transportation were key factors for India and other emerging economies as they look to decide on large scale purchases of vaccines. \u201cA vaccine that cannot penetrate and be given in a large population to provide high vaccine coverage you may as well not give it at all,\u201d Poonawalla told Reuters. \u201cIf it\u2019s not affordable and logistically transferable, even if it is 110% effective what is the sense?\u201d A Hungarian ruling party politician, who resigned as a member of the European parliament on Sunday, said he was present at a house party broken up last Friday by Brussels police for breaching lockdown rules, Reuters reports. J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, a senior member of prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ruling conservative Fidesz party, said in a statement he had cooperated with police. The statement was quoted in an identical way by at least four prominent Hungarian news web sites. Reuters was unable to download the original text. Healthcare workers and others recommended for the first Covid-19 inoculations in the US could start getting shots within 24 hours or at most within 36-48 hours after the vaccine receives regulatory nod. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the US government\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d vaccine programme, said he hoped 20 million people will be immunised by the end of this year. \u201cWithin 24 hours, maybe at most 36 to 48 hours, from the approval, the vaccine can be in people\u2019s arms,\u201d Slaoui said at a Washington Post event. Nine restaurant, bar and nightclub owners began a fifth day of hunger strike on Tuesday outside Portugal\u2019s parliament in protest against coronavirus restrictions. \u201cWe need support ... to keep our heads above water,\u201d said Alberto Cabral, who runs a nightclub. The protesters \u2013 camping outside parliament and living off water, tea and coffee donated by their supporters \u2013 say they will not eat until they are met by the prime minister and economy minister. One more business owner joined their strike on Sunday. Bars and nightclubs have been closed since March and while restaurants were allowed to reopen in May, a curfew and weekend lockdown in place across most of the country since 8 November has angered restaurateurs, who say many of their businesses will not survive the year. \u201cIt\u2019s just insolvencies, insolvencies,\u201d restaurant owner Joao Sotto Mayor said. \u201cMany businesses depend on this time ... it\u2019s incredibly important that next weekend we return to normal opening hours.\u201d An online petition by the movement behind the strike is gathering steam, with nearly 45,000 signatures so far and gaining several thousand each hour. In compensation for weekend lockdowns, the government offered restaurants 20% of their average revenue between January and October of this year. Owners say that is nowhere near enough. \u201cHow can we sustain a company that isn\u2019t earning any money but has to pay taxes, pay for light, water?\u201d asked Jose Gouveia, a nightclub owner and spokesman for the movement. The number of people registered as unemployed jumped 34.5% in October from last year\u2019s figures with about 72% of the newly unemployed working in restaurants or retail, according to government data. \u201cEverything is dying here in Portugal,\u201d Gouveia said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France should be in a position to embark on a broader Covid-19 vaccination campaign between April and June next year, after initially targeting much a smaller group of people. A first vaccination campaign starting towards the end of December or in January would be targeted at a smaller segment of the population, Macron said after meeting with the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo. France\u2019s top health advisory body said on Monday it had recommended Covid-19 vaccinations should target retirement homes residents and their staff first. \u201cThere will be a first phase that will start as soon as possible, meaning when approvals are in from European health authorities and doses are supplied,\u201d Macron said, adding that figuring out the logistics of this first campaign would be complex, in part due to the very cold conditions needed to store some vaccines. He said a second phase of vaccinations would likely take place between April and June. \u201cIt will be broader and more aimed at the general public,\u201d Macron said. He reiterated that vaccination would not be compulsory in France, but added the country would aim to get as many people as possible on board \u201cwith a strategy to convince and based on transparency\u201d. France has one of the world\u2019s lowest levels of trust in vaccines. According to an Ipsos poll for the World Economic Forum, only 59% of French respondents said they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if it became available, compared with 67% in the US and 85% in Britain. The US Transportation Department said it has made preparations to enable the \u201cimmediate mass shipment\u201d of Covid-19 vaccines and completed all necessary regulatory measures. The department said US agencies have been coordinating with private sector companies, which will carry vaccines from manufacturing facilities to distribution centres and inoculation points. It added it had established \u201cappropriate safety requirements for all potential hazards involved in shipping the vaccine, including standards for dry ice and lithium batteries used in cooling\u201d. The coronavirus pandemic will further shift the global balance of power in Asia\u2019s favour, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said, while the health minister said he expected Germany to start rolling out vaccinations by January. \u201cThe pandemic will set us back economically,\u201d Merkel said, pointing to an economic revival in countries such as China and South Korea, where more people wore masks and there were fewer demonstrations against lockdowns. \u201cI believe this will lead again to another reordering of the regions,\u201d she said, adding that Germany did not want to control its population in the way China did, but it did have to make more of an effort to keep up with technological developments. Last month, German police fired water cannon and pepper spray in an effort to scatter thousands of protesters in Berlin angry at coronavirus restrictions. Germany was widely praised for its response to the first coronavirus wave in spring, but it imposed lighter lockdown measures than neighbouring countries as a second wave hit Europe in November and infection numbers have stayed stubbornly high. Schools remain open but private gatherings are limited to five people from Tuesday and fewer people are allowed in shops. The official case tally rose by 13,604 on Tuesday to 1,067,473, while deaths were up 388 to 16,636. The Bavarian city of Nuremberg tightened its rules on Tuesday to try to rein in a surge of the virus, forcing people to stay home unless they have a compelling reason until 20 December. The European Medicines Agency said earlier on Tuesday it planned to decide on whether to approve the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech by 29 December, and by 12 January on the vaccine being developed by Moderna. \u201cI assume that we will start being able to vaccinate in January at the latest,\u201d the German health minister, Jens Spahn, said. Austria\u2019s government appears to have bowed to pressure from Germany, France and Italy and will ban skiing holidays over the Christmas break in an attempt to control the coronavirus pandemic, Austrian media is reporting. The decision, expected to be officially announced on Wednesday, follows heated disagreements between Berlin and Vienna. On Tuesday morning, Austria\u2019s tourist minister accused the German government of interfering in its domestic affairs after Angela Merkel said she had wanted a ban on skiing holidays. The chancellor secured the backing of the Italian and French governments as well as the leaders of the 16 German states. According to initial reports, Austrian resorts, including hotels, restaurants and ski schools will be closed into January. In some resorts, ski lifts are expected to stay open but tourists will be told to stay away. Merkel said last week she would seek an alliance within Europe to support her efforts for ski resorts to close until the new year at least, amid fears of a repeat of events last winter when Austrian resorts in particular proved to be a breeding ground for the virus. She admitted that strong resistance from Austria meant it would be hard to find an \u201ceasy solution\u201d. Elisabeth K\u00f6stinger, Austria\u2019s tourism minister, had said in an interview with Bavarian broadcasting that her country had no intention of abiding by any restrictions. Lastminute.com, the flight and hotel booking site, has agreed to pay \u00a37m in refunds to more than 9,000 customers whose holidays were cancelled because of coronavirus \u2013 many of whom have spent months battling for repayments. After an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), lastminute.com has given undertakings that it will pay refunds as soon as possible, and by 31 January at the latest. Angry holidaymakers say they have spent months trying to force the online travel agent to make refunds \u2013 many from hotels and flights that were cancelled during the UK lockdown in March and April. Lastminute.com \u2013 which came to prominence 20 years ago \u2013 is no longer a UK based company but is a brand operated by a Swiss group, BravoFly, in Chiasso, close to the border with Italy. Many customers have written to the Guardian\u2019s consumer champions column to complain that attempts to contact the company have hit a brick wall. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has appealed to rebellious members of his own party as parliament prepares to vote on tough new Covid restrictions to replace an England-wide lockdown. The month-long stay-at-home order ends at midnight GMT and the Conservative government plans to restore regionalised restrictions, depending on coronavirus rates in different parts of the country. While London will escape the tightest tier 3 rules, more than 23 million people will fall into the category, including in some affluent Conservative-held constituencies, forcing hospitality and leisure facilities to remain closed. Johnson said the onset of vaccines and mass testing would \u201callow us to reclaim our lives\u201d but until then, \u201cwe cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter\u201d. \u201cAll we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and being injected into our arms,\u201d he told the House of Commons before the vote on the new tiers later Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said \u201cwe are all too grimly aware\u201d of the impact on struggling businesses, as the collapse of two retail groups threw the future of 25,000 jobs into doubt. But interviewed on BBC radio, he stressed: \u201cWhat would the effect be on the economy if the NHS [National Health Service] was overwhelmed?\u201d Isolated hotspots mean entire counties are due to enter tier 3, despite their infection rates remaining below the English average. That has prompted outrage from dozens of Conservative MPs, who are threatening to vote against the plan. Johnson, however, said future changes would make the tiered restrictions more \u201cgranular\u201d and that they will be subject to reviews every two weeks from mid-December. He also announced new cash support for pubs forced to close unless they can offer a \u201csubstantial meal\u201d, although government ministers have given differing interpretations of whether that includes snacks such as scotch eggs. Gove pointed to the experience of the devolved government in Wales, which he said is having to \u201cslam the brakes on again\u201d with fresh curbs on hospitality venues after a two-week lockdown last month. Britain has been Europe\u2019s worst-hit country during the pandemic, recording more than 58,000 deaths from about 1.6 million cases. Sweden, whose unorthodox pandemic strategy placed it in the global spotlight, has registered 17,629 new coronavirus cases since Friday. The increase compares with 17,265 new cases recorded during the corresponding period last week. Sweden does not publish updates of Covid-19 statistics on weekends and Mondays. Sweden registered 117 new deaths, taking the total to 6,798. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than some larger European countries. Bangladesh expects to receive its first batch of coronavirus vaccines by February which people will receive free of charge, the health secretary has said. The south Asian country of more than 160 million last month signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India to buy 30m doses of the vaccine developed by the British drugmaker AstraZeneca. \u201cWe expect to get the vaccine as early as February and people will get it for free,\u201d the health secretary, Abdul Mannan, told reporters. Frontline workers, like health service providers and police, will be given priority. In the global race to develop vaccines against Covid-19, AstraZeneca\u2019s candidate is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures. Some experts, however, raised questions about its trial data. Bangladesh will also get 68m doses of vaccine from the Gavi vaccine alliance, Mannan said, referring to a global health partnership set up in 2000 to increase access to immunisation in poor countries. Experts say Bangladesh, with patchy healthcare facilities, could face another surge in infections, having so far confirmed 467,225 cases and 6,675 deaths since the pandemic began. Daily infections have shown a rising trend over the past few weeks, with 2,293 new cases and 31 deaths reported on Tuesday. Turkey will implement its strictest lockdown measures so far in an effort to tackle the soaring coronavirus infection rate, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has announced. In a televised address on Monday night, the Turkish leader said the country would reinstate total weekend lockdowns and extend the curfew to weeknights from 9pm-5am. The new measures go into effect from today, 1 December. Preschools, Turkish baths, swimming pools and amusement parks have been ordered to close and restaurants are restricted to delivery services. Erdo\u011fan also announced that people older than 65 or younger than 20 \u2013 who are currently only allowed out for three hours a day \u2013 would not be allowed to use public transport. Access to shopping malls and other large indoor public spaces will require a contact-tracing code, and weddings and funerals are limited to 30 people. The new controls come following fury from doctors\u2019 unions and opposition parties after the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, admitted that only the number of new daily symptomatic cases have been released for the last four months. Last week, Ankara resumed reporting all positive tests for the virus, causing daily cases to shoot up to about 30,000 and putting Turkey among the hardest-hit nations during the second wave of the pandemic in Europe. Twenty healthcare workers have died in one week from Covid-19 complications, the Turkish Medical Association said, and ICU bed occupation is about 71%. The Madrid region has inaugurated a \u20ac100m hospital to treat Covid-19 patients, though unions say a lack of healthcare workers has raised questions about how it will be staffed. The cost of the newly built hospital, which doubled from the original announcement, and Spain\u2019s shortage of health sector staff have been criticised by local opposition politicians and labour unions. Arriving at the hospital for the inauguration, the regional president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, was greeted by dozens of protesting healthcare workers with placards reading: \u201cPoliticians\u2019 hospitals\u201d and \u201cEnough.\u201d The new hospital, called Isabel Zendal in honour of a 19th century nurse who led early vaccination campaigns, was built in just three months near Madrid airport. It will eventually have a capacity of 1,056 beds, including 48 intensive care beds, the regional authority said. Initially a wing with 240 beds, including an intensive care unit, will open. That wing will require 669 staff including nurses, doctors and technicians. \u201cThe hiring will start gradually according to healthcare needs,\u201d the Madrid region said in a statement. Labour unions say with healthcare staff working flat out in a country that has been hit hard by the coronavirus, and with many hospitals suffering staff shortages, they fear the new hospital will only poach crews from other health facilities. \u201cNothing will be solved,\u201d the nursing union SATSE said in a statement, calling the new hospital \u201ca vanity project\u201d. \u201cRather, existing units and services will be dismantled as they will have to operate without the professional nurses they need.\u201d Spain has registered more than 1.6 million coronavirus cases, the second highest number in western Europe, and more than 45,000 deaths. The US has entered the final month of the year hoping that promising vaccine candidates will soon be approved to halt the rapidly spreading coronavirus after 4.2 million new cases were reported in November. The new Covid-19 cases were more than double the previous monthly record set in October, as large numbers of Americans still refuse to wear masks and continue to gather in holiday crowds, against the recommendation of experts. With outgoing president Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus strategy relying heavily on a vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to rule on 10 December on whether to approve the emergency use of a vaccine developed by Pfizer. A second candidate from Moderna could follow a week later, officials have said, raising hopes that Americans could start receiving inoculations before the end the year, although widespread vaccinations could take months. Other global pharmaceuticals including AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson also have vaccines in the works, leading a member of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d programme to predict the country could be vaccinated by June. \u201cOne hundred percent of the Americans that want the vaccine will have the vaccine by (June). We will have over 300 million doses available to the American public well before then,\u201d Paul Ostrowski, the vaccine programme\u2019s director of supply, production and distribution, told MSNBC television on Monday. In the meantime, leading health officials are pleading with Americans to follow their recommendations and help arrest a pandemic that killed more than 36,000 people in November, pushing hospitalisations to a record high of nearly 93,000 on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. Biden has pledged to make combating the coronavirus his top priority upon taking office on 20 January, saying he will rely on the best scientific evidence. In the absence of a federal blueprint to curb the spread of the virus, states are issuing new or revamped restrictions on businesses and social life. California\u2019s governor said he might renew a stay-at-home order in the coming days, warning that ICU admissions were on track to exceed statewide capacity by mid-December unless public health policies and social behaviour changed. \u201cThe red flags are flying,\u201d the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said. \u201cIf these trends continue, we\u2019re going to have to take much more dramatic, arguably drastic, action.\u201d Russia is trying to import foreign-made drugs to fight the Covid-19 pandemic due to a shortage of products at home, the health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said, as authorities reported a record 569 new daily deaths from the coronavirus. Russia has several vaccines against the virus in the works and produces some drugs domestically, including Coronavir and Avifavir, both of which are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for treatment. During a meeting with senior government officials on Tuesday, Murashko said there was a problem with the supply of favipiravir in some regions. \u201cSupply volumes of anti-clotting agents have increased. But we still see that a shortage for the network remains, and so we are working with the trade and industry ministry on additional deliveries from abroad,\u201d he said. New daily infection numbers, which stood at 26,402 on Tuesday, have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record high on 27 November. Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said the growth of the disease was slowing. However, the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said the situation remained quite tense in many of Russia\u2019s more than 80 regions. In 17 regions, hospital bed capacity was less than 5%, said Murashko, with the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and St Petersburg presenting the greatest cause for concern. Russia has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted curbs. Vietnam will suspend all inbound commercial flights after it detected its first Covid-19 outbreak in nearly three months, the prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said. Phuc said inbound evacuation flights can continue but anyone coming in will still have to go into 14 days of quarantine. Thai authorities have urged calm as they scramble to trace a potential coronavirus outbreak after at least four women tested positive on returning from neighbouring Myanmar. Since detecting the first case outside of China back in January, Thailand has managed to keep Covid-19 infections low, at just over 4,000 cases, in part by imposing strict entry rules. But it shares an extremely porous 2,400km-border (1,500 miles) with Myanmar, where the virus is rampant, with more than 1,000 new cases a day in recent months. Four Thai women who worked in the Myanmar border town of Tachilek and returned to Thailand have now tested positive, health officials said on Tuesday. The prime minister, Prayut Chan-ocha said so far more than 100 people the women might have been in contact with had been tested, and officials were tracking down more. The authorities have not confirmed where the women worked in Tachilek, but Thai media reported they were employed at an \u201centertainment centre\u201d \u2013 a euphemism that can include bars, karaoke lounges and brothels. \u201cOnly these women, working in this kind of venue \u2013 where they socialise with many people ... have tested positive,\u201d Prayut said Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to panic about this.\u201d Since the pandemic, border patrols have stepped up surveillance to prevent illegal migrants from crossing into the kingdom. On returning to Thailand, the first woman travelled to the northern city of Chiang Mai, where she went to a karaoke bar and a shopping mall \u2013 potentially coming into contact with hundreds of people. The city has been put on high alert and authorities have sprayed disinfectant on areas the woman was in. Her other three colleagues stayed in Chiang Rai, just an hour across the border from Tachilek, and self-isolated in hotels before getting tested. Tachilek serves as a conduit for the so-called Golden Triangle\u2019s lucrative drug trade and is home to numerous casinos and brothels. Myanmar currently has more than 90,000 cases, with parts of northern Rakhine state and the commercial capital, Yangon, under lockdown. The European commission is likely to give the final authorisation for the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines days after the EU drug regulator approves them, a spokesman for the EU executive has said. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said earlier on Tuesday it planned to decide on whether to approve the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech by 29 December, and by 12 January for the vaccine being developed by Moderna. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a matter of days. The goal is to do it rapidly,\u201d the spokesman told a news conference, adding the exact date depended on the EMA\u2019s possible authorisations. Under EU rules, EMA recommends the authorisation of a drug or vaccine and the EU commission authorises them on the basis of the EMA\u2019s scientific advice. Hamas\u2019s Gaza leader, Yehya Al-Sinwar, has tested positive for Covid-19, a spokesman for the Islamist militant group, which runs the Palestinian territory, said. Sinwar, 58, is \u201cfollowing the advice of health authorities and taking precautionary measures\u201d, spokesman Hazem Qassem said, without disclosing whether the Hamas chief was in quarantine. \u201cHe is in good health and he is pursuing his duties as usual,\u201d Qassem said. Sinwar, a former head of Hamas\u2019s security apparatus, became the movement\u2019s Gaza leader in 2017, six years after he was freed in a prisoner swap with Israel after more than 20 years in jail. Gaza has logged nearly 21,000 coronavirus cases and 111 deaths, mostly since August, amid concern of a wider outbreak in the densely populated enclave of 2 million people. The European Medicines Agency said if its experts have received enough data from drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna about their coronavirus vaccine candidates, the agency would complete its reviews for the Pfizer vaccine by 29 December and the Moderna vaccine by 12 January, at the latest. The companies said earlier on Tuesday they had submitted approval requests for their vaccine candidates to the European drugs regulator. Germany\u2019s BioNTech and its US partner, Pfizer, have applied for EU regulatory approval for their Covid-19 vaccine, raising hopes that the first jabs could be administered in December. The two companies said they had submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Monday seeking \u201cconditional marketing authorisation (CMA)\u201d for their vaccine. The move comes after large-scale tests showed their vaccine was 95% effective against Covid-19 and triggered no serious side effects. If approved by the Amsterdam-based EMA, the vaccine could potentially be rolled out \u201cin Europe before the end of 2020\u201d, the companies said in a statement. Pfizer and BioNTech already filed for emergency use authorisation with the US Food and Drug Administration on 20 November. If US regulators give the green light, Americans could start getting vaccinated around mid-December. UK regulators are also screening the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. \u201cWe have known since the beginning of this journey that patients are waiting, and we stand ready to ship Covid-19 vaccine doses as soon as potential authorisations will allow us,\u201d Pfizer chief executive, Albert Bourla, said. A fellow frontrunner in the global vaccine race, the US biotech company Moderna said on Monday it had sought emergency regulatory approval for its Covid-19 shot in both the US and Europe. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are both based on a new technology that uses mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus. This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters the coronavirus. But Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be kept in long term storage at -20C , while Pfizer\u2019s requires -70C. Pfizer and BioNTech have previously said they expect to manufacture up to 50m doses of their vaccine globally this year, and up to 1.3bn doses by the end of 2021. The UK and other countries should steer clear of cutting government spending to ensure a stronger economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. In its latest economic outlook report, the leading global thinktank said it expected the UK economy to contract by 11.2% this year, compared with the 10.1% fall in GDP it was forecasting in September. The Paris-based organisation also sharply downgraded its forecasts for UK growth next year, to 4.2% from 7.6% three months ago. The OECD said governments were at risk of failing to learn the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis when the UK and other wealthy nations cut back spending in response to record levels of national debt, choking off the economic recovery. In a clear warning to nations contemplating spending cuts or tax rises, the OECD said public spending would be vital to support the rebound in growth expected next year as Covid-19 vaccines enable a gradual return to normality. Tokyo\u2019s governor has asked the government to temporarily exclude Tokyo residents aged over 65 from a scheme encouraging travel and tourism in Japan, saying it could expose them to the coronavirus and result in more severe cases of Covid-19. The Go To Travel campaign offers subsidies for domestic travel. It has been credited by the Japanese government with boosting the country\u2019s regional economies, and helping airlines and other travel companies weather the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign, however, has come under pressure as Japan encounters a fresh wave of coronavirus infections that some fear could escalate beyond the capacity of hospitals to cope. \u201cThe elderly are more susceptible to becoming severely ill, so from that standpoint we asked for the change,\u201d Yuriko Koike told journalists following a meeting with prime minister Yoshihide Suga. \u201cThe decision and how to go about it is for the government to make.\u201d Suga\u2019s government last week agreed to suspend the Go To Travel programme in two cities, Sapporo in northern Japan and Osaka in the west, following a sharp rise in cases. Japan\u2019s capital on Tuesday reported 372 new cases, the seventh straight day above 300, with 33 Covid deaths nationwide, the most in a single day since the outbreak began, according to public broadcaster NHK. Economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura earlier said the request from Tokyo asked that elderly people be excluded from the travel campaign until 17 December. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be taking over the liveblog for the next few hours. As always, please do get in touch with any story tips or personal experiences you would like to share. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Vietnam has reported two more coronavirus cases linked to a rare domestic infection in its commercial hub Ho Chi Minh City. The government has urged public vigilance and tighter enforcement of health measures. From Reuters: The south-east Asian nation is back on high alert after confirming on Monday the country\u2019s first community infection in 89 days, prompting the closure of several places in the densely-populated southern city. The latest cases have been traced back to a flight attendant, who had been kept inside a quarantine facility for five days before being released to self-isolate at home. The health minister, Nguyen Thanh Long, said: The flight attendant contracted the virus inside the quarantine area then spread it to others during his home-quarantine time. It\u2019s the first ever time such thing happened. The flight attendant seriously violated quarantine regulations. With its usually strict quarantine and tracking measures, Vietnam has managed to quickly contain its coronavirus outbreaks, allowing it to resume its economic activities earlier than much of Asia. Vietnam crushed its first wave of coronavirus infections in April and went nearly 100 days without local transmission until the virus re-emerged in the central tourist city of Danang in July and spread widely, before being contained in a few weeks. The prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, asked citizens and authorities to step up measures to guard against the spread of coronavirus, especially ahead of the Communist party\u2019s five-yearly congress: There will be many big gathering events ahead the National Congress, our country\u2019s biggest political event, we can\u2019t let the virus affect us. Vietnam has registered a total of 1,349 coronavirus cases altogether, with 35 deaths. Lewis Hamilton will miss this weekend\u2019s Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain after testing positive for coronavirus. The seven-time Formula One world champion is in isolation after his positive result was announced on Tuesday morning. An F1 statement said: The FIA, Formula One and Mercedes Team can today confirm that during mandatory pre-race PRC testing for the Sakhir Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton has tested positive for Covid-19. In accordance with Covid-19 protocols, he is now isolating. All contacts have been declared. The procedures set out by the FIA and Formula One will ensure no wider impact on this weekend\u2019s event. Ireland emerged from maximum Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday, prompting pre-dawn shopping sprees and appeals to the public to stay vigilant against infection. Beauty salons, gyms, department stores and other non-essential retail opened after a six-week lockdown, drawing queues of shoppers outside some stores before 6am. Restaurants and pubs that serve food can reopen from Saturday. The second lockdown drove down the 14-day national incidence rate to 89.2 cases per 100,000 people, one of the lowest in Europe, but health officials had hoped that by now the virus\u2019s reproduction number (R) would be about 0.5, but it is between 0.7 and 1. They warned that infections could swiftly surge again unless people minimised socialising. \u201cJust because you can do things tomorrow doesn\u2019t mean you should,\u201d Ronan Glynn, the assistant chief medical officer, said on Monday. Officials said office parties should not be held. Under the new rules restaurants and gastropubs are not supposed to take bookings for office parties or other business-related gatherings. The government said it will impose fresh restrictions if infections soar. Not everyone was celebrating the easing of restrictions. Fr PJ Hughes, a county Cavan parish priest, said capping the number of people in a church at 50 would hinder Christmas ceremonies. He will not be \u201cdictated to by a pagan and communist government\u201d, he told the Irish Times. Such a powerful image from the Getty photographer Go Nakamura of Dr Joseph Varon, chief of staff at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, in the US, taking time to comfort a patient on Thanksgiving Day. Varon was on his 252nd consecutive day working during the coronavirus pandemic, when the pictures was taken. Today is day 256. He told CNN he was entering the Covid-19 ICU when he saw the elderly patient \u201cout of his bed and trying to get out of the room\u201d. Varon said: As I\u2019m going inside my Covid unit I see that this elderly patient is out of his bed and trying to get out of the room and he\u2019s crying. So, I get close to him and I tell him \u2018why are you crying\u2019 and the man says, \u2018I want to be with my wife\u2019. So, I just grab him, I hold him, I did not know that I was being photographed at that time. The Texas doctor today pleaded with people to \u201cdo the basic things\u201d to avoid infection and stay out of hospital. Varon said he was frustrated by people not doing the right thing as coronavirus patients continue to fill his hospital beds: I do this day in and day out and people are out there doing the wrong thing. People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls \u2013 it is crazy \u2013 it\u2019s like we work, work, work, work, work and people don\u2019t listen and then they end up in my ICU What people need to know is that \u2013 I don\u2019t want to have to be hugging them. They need to do the basic things: keep your social distance; wear your mask; wash your hands and avoid going to places where there are a lot of people. Very simple. If people can do that health care workers like me will be able to \u2013 hopefully rest. Varon said the impact on healthcare workers was enormous: I don\u2019t know what keeps me going, I don\u2019t know how I haven\u2019t broken down. My nurses have broken down. My nurses cry in the middle of the day because they get so sad, sometimes for situations like this. Just seeing a patient that\u2019s crying because he wants to see his family. Varon said he was trying to be transparent to the media so that the public could see the reality of the situation in his hospital and had given Nakamura access to his Covid-19 ward, which is how the image of him had been captured. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has jumped this morning \u2013 with its biggest monthly gain in more than three decades thanks to the hope of a working Covid-19 vaccine and upbeat factory activity data fuelling hopes of a global economic recovery. From Reuters: The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 1.7% as data showed China\u2019s factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November. Asia-focused banks and trade-reliant miners were among the top boosts to the index. In the UK, British factories recorded their fastest growth in almost three years last month. Oliver Brennan, senior macro strategist at TS Lombard said: The FTSE 100 is a global bellwether so any data that supports cyclical recovery is going to benefit the UK markets. The domestically focused FTSE 250 added 1.1%, as attention turned to Brexit trade talks, with the UK set to leave the European Union within weeks. Negotiations are still stuck on fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution because the European Union is asking too much, the prominent Brexiter Michael Gove said on Tuesday. Hopes that the world will bounce back from the ravages of coronavirus in the new year have been buoyed by strong growth in output from Asia\u2019s huge manufacturing centres, led by an accelerating post-pandemic boom in China. China\u2019s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday, in the latest sign that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is recovering to pre-pandemic levels. In the UK, the Ofsted chief inspector of schools will warn today that the invisibility of vulnerable children as a result of the pandemic should be a matter of national concern. Amanda Spielman is expected to say that school closures during the first national lockdown had a \u201cdramatic impact\u201d on the number of child protection referrals made to local authorities. Councils are now more likely to be responding to a legacy of abuse and neglect after local safeguarding partners struggled to identify children and families in need of early support and protection, according to the watchdog. The inspectorate\u2019s annual report is expected to highlight that, in normal times, about 20% of referrals to local authorities come from schools and early years settings as staff spot signs of abuse or neglect. A planned air travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong has been delayed until next year, according to the cities\u2019 authorities, after to a surge in coronavirus cases in Hong Kong. The first flights between the two Asian financial hubs were called off a day before they were due to depart on 22 November, Reuters reports. If they had gone ahead it would have been the first quarantine-free travel bubble in Asia. The civil aviation authority of Singapore said in a statement there would be a review in late December over when to proceed. In the UK, new guidance has been published on Santa\u2019s grottos, carol singing and nativity plays. PA Media reports: Festive traditions must go ahead only within the regulations \u2013 with limited numbers allowed and social distancing required. Door-to-door carol singers can spread their annual cheer \u2013 but only in groups of six and while keeping at least 2 metres away from \u201cthe threshold of any dwellings\u201d. Government guidance, published on Sunday to cover the Christmas period, also allows indoor singing when England\u2019s national lockdown ends on 2 December, but only by choirs and with no audience participation. Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said the news that people can come together to sing outdoors over the festive season \u201cwill bring comfort and joy to many\u201d. For door-to-door carol singing, where there are more than six people, the groups should not mingle or socialise, the guidance states. Participants are expected to follow social distancing by staying at least 2 metres apart from anyone who is not from the same household, and the same distance away from the door of the property outside which they are singing. Indoor singing by professional and amateur choirs can take place according to the particular area\u2019s tier, but audiences or congregations are not to join in \u201cany activity that can create aerosols, including singing, shouting and chanting\u201d. Those activities are known to increase the risk of virus transmission. For indoor choirs, the maximum number of people present \u201cshould take into account the area of the space and the requirement to maintain 2 metres social distancing at all times\u201d, the guidance states. Bishop Mullally, who chairs the church\u2019s recovery group, said: Singing is a very special part of our worship, especially at Advent and Christmas, so I know that the announcement that we will be able to come together for public singing outdoors this Christmas will bring comfort and joy to many. Advent and Christmas this year will not be the same as previous years but having outdoor congregational singing and indoor carol services with choirs is a reasonable balance and recognises our duty to protect and care for each other. Meanwhile school nativity plays will be allowed to go ahead \u201cwithin existing school bubbles\u201d and avoiding any mixing across groups. Audiences will only be allowed to attend in tier 1 and 2 areas \u2013 subject to \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d. For proud parents in tier 3, schools are advised to use live-streaming or record the performances. Santa\u2019s grottos can open in all tiers \u2013 so long as they are in venues which are allowed to open. The guidance warns the venues should put \u201cappropriate Covid-secure measures, including social distancing\u201d in place. For people hoping to get in the festive mood by attending a Christmas market, the government advises they must check the rules according to their tier. It states: The rules might be different for indoor shops and open air shops, such as Christmas markets or Christmas tree markets. Personally, I am very sad not to be able to attend my son\u2019s first ever nativity play this year, especially as he is the eponymous Sleepy Shepherd, and will definitely never get such an important role again. I\u2019m hoping at least for a recording we can taunt him with on his 18th birthday. Russia has reported a record 569 deaths linked to Covid-19 today, bringing the official death toll to 40,464. Authorities also reported 26,402 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, including 6,524 in the capital Moscow, bringing the national cumulative tally to 2,322,056. Thanks to regular reader Scott Lafferty, who has been in touch to remind us that the Netherlands has today finally made face masks mandatory in indoor public spaces. Face masks will be compulsory in all public buildings, shops, and stations from tomorrow as the coronavirus law comes into effect, and people who refuse to wear one face a fine of \u20ac95, reports Dutch News. The Netherlands is one of the last countries in Europe to impose the wearing of masks following pressure from the public and MPs, but the Dutch health institute RIVM, which advises the government, still maintains that face masks do not significantly lower the risk of infection. it seems unclear how the mandatory measure will be implemented, however. Retail chains, such as Ahold, which includes the largest Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn, Etos and Gall &amp; Gall, have already said they will \u2018inform customers about the obligation but not refuse non-wearers\u2019. The chain said they won\u2019t ask anyone why they are not wearing a mask, as it could be for a medical reason and they don\u2019t want to intrude on anyone\u2019s privacy. In other news, thanks to this reader, and writing this post, I now know what winkelwagentje means in Dutch. In the UK the British prime minister is facing a difficult day \u2013 he is trying to get a vote passed in the House of Commons today that would leave much of the country still facing severe restrictions. But the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, has decided to break with the government in a vote on Covid restrictions for the first time \u2013 while at the same time the government is scrambling to contain a Tory rebellion by unveiling a multimillion-pound fund for pubs, write my colleagues Jessica Elgot, Peter Walker and Rajeev Syal. They say: The prime minister is to announce new one-off discretionary funding paid to councils for \u201cwet\u201d pubs and bars which cannot open under the strictest new tier restrictions for England, the Guardian understands. But the Labour party is understood to believe that support for the hospitality sector must go further, and will abstain in Tuesday\u2019s Commons vote on the tiers system, which is due to replace lockdown rules from Wednesday and put 99% of the country into tiers 2 and 3. The vote is still expected to pass. Though Boris Johnson will hope to win around some rebels with the new funding, lockdown-sceptic MPs were expressing anger on Monday night at the publication of an impact assessment of the economic and health costs of the stricter tier system. I\u2019m Alexandra Topping and I\u2019ve be at the helm of the global liveblog for the next few hours. As ever, we love to hear from readers all over the globe. Please do get in touch on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com or I\u2019m @LexyTopping on Twitter and my DMs are open. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Just leaving this under the tree as I go \u2013 Melania has decided not to put the \u201cHo\u201d in horror with the Christmas decorations this year: Here are the key global developments from the last few hours: Dr Scott Atlas has resigned as special adviser to President Donald Trump, a White House official said on Monday, after a controversial four months during which he clashed repeatedly with other members of the coronavirus task force. \u201cI am writing to resign from my position as special advisor to the president of the United States,\u201d Atlas said in a letter to Trump dated 1 December, according to Fox News, which first reported his resignation. US health secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer Inc\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine could be authorised and shipped within days of a 10 December meeting of outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration tasked with reviewing trial data and recommending whether it warrants approval. China has provided North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his family with an experimental coronavirus vaccine, a US analyst said on Tuesday, citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources. Harry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said the Kims and several senior North Korean officials had been vaccinated. It was unclear which company had supplied its drug candidate to the Kims and whether it had proven to be safe, he added. WHO says \u2018will do everything\u2019 to find Covid-19 origins. The World Health Organization insisted Monday it would do everything possible to find the animal origins of Covid-19, insisting that knowledge was vital to preventing future outbreaks. \u201cWe want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. Vietnam reported its first local transmission of Covid-19 in nearly three months on Monday, with officials scrambling to prevent a wider outbreak in the country\u2019s most populous city. The cases were detected in a 70-year-old who had travelled from Melbourne in Australia, and a sailor repatriated from Italy. Both Samoan citizens arrived in Apia on a repatriation flight on 13 November, and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus. But further examination of their cases has found they were both historical: the sailor had the virus in May and the Australian-based man in August. Anies Baswedan, the governor of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, said on Tuesday he had tested positive for Covid-19, as the world\u2019s fourth most populous country struggles to contain a spike in the number of infections. The 51-year-old governor of south-east Asia\u2019s biggest city is among a number of politicians and officials to contract the virus. Indonesia\u2019s transportation and religious affairs ministers have previously been treated for the virus. US may begin vaccinations before Christmas. After a Thanksgiving weekend when the number of people traveling through US airports reached its highest since mid-March, a top government official said on Monday some Americans could begin receiving coronavirus vaccinations before Christmas. UN tourism body urges uniformity in virus travel rules. The World Tourism Organization called Monday for the standardisation of traveller health checks and the establishment of air corridors to ease international travel during the pandemic. The call came at a conference in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands as the global tourism industry reels from a year in which travel restrictions to slow the coronavirus pandemic have decimated the sector. Japan cancels Yamanashi contest after eight speed skaters get coronavirus. The Japan Skating Federation has decided to cancel a competition this month in Yamanashi prefecture, west of the capital Tokyo, after eight speed skaters were confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus. The federation will cancel the event, set to run from Friday to Sunday, to ensure the safety of athletes and others involved, it said on Monday. Los Angeles shuts down Covid testing site to allow film shooting. Los Angeles, which on Tuesday entered stay-at-home order, has shut down a \u201cheavily visited\u201d testing site in order to allow a film shoot to happen there, Deadline reports. Three more members of the touring Pakistan cricket party have returned positive tests to Covid-19, according to New Zealand\u2019s health ministry. In a significant setback to the Pakistan\u2019s hopes of a competitive series against the Black Caps, the latest cases mean 10 of the 53-strong group have tested positive for coronavirus since arriving in New Zealand last month. Hopes that the world will bounce back from the ravages of coronavirus in the new year have been buoyed by strong growth in output from Asia\u2019s huge manufacturing centres, led by an accelerating post-pandemic boom in China. China\u2019s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday, in the latest sign that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is recovering to pre-pandemic levels. China\u2019s Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 54.9 from October\u2019s 53.6, marking the highest level since November 2010. The gauge stayed well above the 50-level \u2013 which separates growth from contraction \u2013 for the seventh consecutive month. A steady recovery in global demand also helped Japan\u2019s factory activity move a notch closer to stabilisation in November, while in South Korea the same metric grew at the fastest pace in nearly a decade: With more than 530,000 infections and nearly 17,000 deaths, the country has the highest tallies in Southeast Asia, though some health experts say limited testing and contact tracing is masking a far higher caseload. Jakarta, a bustling megacity, has also recorded new record highs in infections over the past month, with an average of around 1,240 cases per day in the past week. Unlike some neighbouring countries, Indonesia has not brought in strict national lockdowns but opted for local curbs. Since October, Jakarta\u2019s governor has relaxed curbs to reinstate \u201clarge-scale social restrictions,\u201d which means malls and restaurants can operate though with shorter hours. Some health experts and officials have linked the recent spike in cases to mass gatherings in an around the capital. This has included thousands joining street protests against a new job creation law and large gatherings, often with little social distancing, to mark the return from exile of controversial Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab. More on Jakarta\u2019s governor testing positive for coronavirus now, from Reuters: Anies Baswedan, the governor of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, said on Tuesday he had tested positive for Covid-19, as the world\u2019s fourth most populous country struggles to contain a spike in the number of infections. The 51-year-old governor of Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest city is among a number of politicians and officials to contract the virus. Indonesia\u2019s transportation and religious affairs ministers have previously been treated for the virus. In a video posted on his Instagram account, the governor said he was currently asymptomatic and would self-isolate. \u201cI would like to remind everyone that Covid is still around and can come to anyone,\u201d he said. His deputy, Ahmad Riza Patria, also tested positive to the virus on Sunday, according to the city\u2019s website. Indonesia, a country of 270 million people, has posted three days of record-high case numbers in the past week. The subway system serving the US capital region may be forced to make devastating cuts in 2021, including ending weekend services, closing 19 stations and shrinking weekday operations if Congress does not approve additional assistance, Reuters reports. The transit system\u2019s proposed budget, which was made public late Monday, is set to be presented Friday and projects total ridership will rise to just 34% of pre-Covid-19 levels for its budget year that starts July 1. The proposal calls for preserving \u201caffordable bare bones service network to sustain essential travel and support the region*s recovery\u201d even as it projects revenue declining by more than $500 million. It also proposes dramatically cutting bus services, from 60 routes to 41. Thousands of Washington-area workers rely on buses and trains to get to jobs throughout the region and many students use the system to attend school. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) serves a region of about 6 million people and last year had 182 million rail riders, but like many public transit systems in the United States, has seen demand plummet because of the coronavirus pandemic. WMATA, which is already cutting 1,400 jobs, projects it will need to cut another 2,400 jobs to meet next year\u2019s budget. In April, Congress approved $25 billion for US public transit systems, including $1.02 billion for the Washington area systems, including about $775 million for WMATA. Much of the US transportation sector has been battered by Covid-19 as millions of workers stay home rather than commute to urban centres and tourism remains sharply lower. Earlier this month, New York City warned it could cut subway and bus service by up to 40% and commuter train service by 50% as it seeks $12 billion in emergency funding. Los Angeles, which on Tuesday entered stay-at-home order, has shut down a \u201cheavily visited\u201d testing site in order to allow a film shoot to happen there, Deadline reports. Deadline: The kiosk at downtown LA\u2019s Union Station will be shuttered on Tuesday so the She\u2019s All That remake can use the iconic terminal as a location. Despite the hundreds of people who use the South Patio located COVID-19 testing site at well-trafficked Union Station, the Miramax pic was granted a permit by FilmLA, Deadline has confirmed. With exterior shots and interior scenes at the terminal. there is estimated to be a total cast and crew size of around 170 at Union Station tomorrow. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 13,604 to 1,067,473, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by 388 to 16,636. For centuries, the maze of narrow, cobbled streets that make up Lisbon\u2019s Alfama neighbourhood has told the story of the city\u2019s past. But in recent years, as trendy cafes and tourist flats proliferated, the historic quarter began telling a worrying tale of the city\u2019s future. A rapid transformation had rippled across the city centre as Airbnb-style tourist rentals swelled to a third of the properties. As locals found themselves priced out and communities began hollowing out, many began grumbling about the aftershocks of terramotourism \u2013 a tourism earthquake. That was, at least, until the pandemic brought tourism to a standstill. \u201cIn a certain sense Covid has created an opportunity,\u201d Fernando Medina, the mayor of Lisbon, told the Guardian. \u201cThe virus didn\u2019t ask us for permission to come in, but we have the ability to use this time to think and to see how we can move in a direction to correct things and put them on the right track.\u201d The city seized on the moment to cast new light on a programme that was in the works prior to the pandemic: an ambitious plan to convert some of the city\u2019s more than 20,000 tourist flats into affordable housing. The initiative, billed by the city as a \u201crisk-free\u201d option, offers landlords the possibility of receiving up to \u20ac1,000 a month by renting their properties to the city for a minimum of five years. From there the city takes over, finding tenants and renting the homes at a subsidised rate capped at a third of the household\u2019s net income: India recorded 31,118 new coronavirus cases, the lowest daily tally since 17 November, data from the health ministry showed on Tuesday. India now has 9.46 million Covid-19 infections, but the number of new daily cases has stayed below the 50,000 mark since Nov. 7 despite a busy festival season last month, according to a Reuters tally. Deaths rose by 482, bringing the total to 137,621. The Jakarta governor and his deputy have both tested positive for coronavirus, Reuters reports. Indonesia confirmed a national record case rise on 29 November, with 6,267 new infections reported, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are a total of 538,883 cases in the country, and 16,945 people have died. Three more members of the touring Pakistan cricket party have returned positive tests to Covid-19, according to New Zealand\u2019s health ministry. AAP: In a significant setback to the Pakistan\u2019s hopes of a competitive series against the Black Caps, the latest cases mean 10 of the 53-strong group have tested positive for coronavirus since arriving in New Zealand last month. Pakistan\u2019s players and staff are completing a fortnight in isolation, as is compulsory on arrival in New Zealand, in a Christchurch hotel. The Covid-19 cases mean none of the group have received permission to leave their hotel to train. The touring party has also earned rebukes from health officials for breaching NZ\u2019s strict quarantine rules by mingling in their hotels. On Monday, the 46 members of the squad to have previously tested negative to Covid-19 were re-tested. Health authorities said 42 returned another negative test result but three were under investigation \u201cto determine whether they are historical cases\u201d - and therefore not infectious - and one result was pending. A Ministry of Health spokeswoman clarified the three had returned positive PCR tests. Pakistan\u2019s tour of three T20s and two Tests is due to begin with a short-form clash against the Black Caps at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on December 18. The Japan Skating Federation has decided to cancel a competition this month in Yamanashi prefecture, west of the capital Tokyo, after eight speed skaters were confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The federation will cancel the event, set to run from Friday to Sunday, to ensure the safety of athletes and others involved, it said on Monday. All the infected skaters were quarantined and in stable condition, public broadcaster NHK said on Tuesday. Federation officials were not immediately available to comment on details. The head of the World Health Organization said on Monday that Mexico is in \u201cbad shape\u201d regarding the coronavirus as infections and deaths surge, while the Mexican government forecast the pandemic would likely continue worsening until January. Mexico\u2019s coronavirus death tally, the fourth highest in the world, stands at almost 106,000. Confirmed cases are in excess of 1.1 million, though public health experts say the true figure is likely significantly higher. \u201cThe number of increase in cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,\u201d WHO\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press briefing in Geneva. Citing the increase in the number of weekly deaths from 2,000 the week of Oct. 12 to around 4,000 by Nov. 23, \u201cThis shows Mexico is in bad shape,\u201d he said. At least seven of Mexico City\u2019s 54 public hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are at full occupancy for coronavirus beds with respirators, according to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The OCHA said another 14 health centers risk being stretched, with Covid-19 bed occupancies exceeding 70%. It noted that Mexico\u2019s Health Ministry reported 63% of all general hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in the capital are occupied. \u201cWhen both indicators, deaths and cases, increase I think this is a very serious problem and we would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,\u201d said Tedros. Speaking later at an evening news conference, Mexico\u2019s deputy health minister, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Tedros and that he did not have to answer him. Separately, Lopez-Gatell said the pandemic would very probably continue to worsen in Mexico until January. Since Mexico began lifting its strictest lockdown restrictions in June, it has been reluctant to reimpose blanket measures because so many of the population living hand-to-mouth depend on being able to go out every day and do business. However, some states have ratcheted up restrictions to contain the pandemic in recent weeks. The head of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian network is urging governments and institutions to combat \u201cfake news\u201d about Covid-19 vaccines which has become \u201ca second pandemic\u201d and start building trust in communities around the world about the critical importance of vaccinating people, AP reports. Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a virtual briefing to the UN Correspondents Association on Monday that \u201cto beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust.\u201d He said there is \u201ca growing hesitancy about vaccines in general, and about a Covid vaccine in particular\u201d around the world, pointing to a recent Johns Hopkins University study in 67 countries that found vaccine acceptance declined significantly in most countries from July to October this year. In a quarter of countries, Rocca said, the study found that the acceptance rate for a vaccine against the coronavirus was near or below 50%, with Japan dropping from 70% to 50% acceptance, and France dropping from 51 percent to 38 percent acceptance. He stressed that the lack of trust \u201cis by no means a Western phenomenon,\u201d citing the federation\u2019s research in recent months in eight African countries \u2013 Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Lesotho and Kenya \u2013 which showed a steady decline in the perceptions of the risk of Covid-19 infection. In the UK, local authorities in tier 3, with the toughest Covid restrictions, will be invited to apply for funds to run mass testing programmes of people with no symptoms, in hopes of driving down the virus and moving to tier 2, the government has said. Public health directors will be able to put forward proposals for testing in those parts of their communities most at risk from the virus, if they so choose, which could be particular neighbourhoods or workplaces where infection rates are high. It would be open to them if they wanted to focus on particular ethnic minority communities, where there have been high death rates, if there was evidence they were more at risk or that an outbreak had originated in one community, with priority groups decided by local councils and directors of public health, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Sarah Boseley and Jessica Elgot report: The World Health Organization insisted Monday it would do everything possible to find the animal origins of Covid-19, insisting that knowledge was vital to preventing future outbreaks, AFP reports \u201cWe want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. He insisted the UN health agency was intent on getting to the bottom of the mystery, and urged critics who have accused it of handing the reins of the probe to China to stop \u201cpoliticising\u201d the issue. \u201cWHO\u2019s position is very, very clear. We need to know the origin of this virus, because it can help us prevent future outbreaks,\u201d Tedros said. The WHO has for months been working to send a team of international experts, including epidemiologists and animal health specialists, to China to help probe the animal origin of the novel coronavirus pandemic and how the virus first crossed over to humans. The organisation sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe. But it has remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection. Last week, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief Michael Ryan said the agency was hoping to send the international team to Wuhan \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Tedros meanwhile rejected on Monday criticism over lacking transparency on the probe, stressing that the names of the experts on the team and the terms of reference had been made public. \u201cThere is nothing to hide. We want to know the origin. I don\u2019t want to have any confusion on that.\u201d Scientists initially believed the killer virus jumped from animals to humans at a market selling exotic animals for meat in the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year. The full story on Scott Atlas\u2019s resignation now: Australia has welcomed its first group of international students to arrive since the coronavirus pandemic began, with more due to follow, AP reports. A charter flight carrying 63 students from mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam and Indonesia landed Monday in the northern city of Darwin. The students will all attend Charles Darwin University, with some new to the campus and others previously enrolled. They are part of a pilot program aimed at boosting the local economy and providing a template for international students to arrive in other parts of Australia. The arrival comes amid growing tensions between Australia and China after a Chinese official this week posted a fake image on Twitter of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child\u2019s throat. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the image \u201crepugnant\u201d and demanded an apology from the Chinese government, but China has not backed down. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan. The arriving students were required to undertake a pre-departure health screening and have been placed in a quarantine facility for two weeks before they can begin attending classes. Dr. Scott Atlas has resigned as special adviser to President Donald Trump, a White House official said on Monday, after a controversial four months during which he clashed repeatedly with other members of the coronavirus task force. \u201cI am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,\u201d Atlas said in a letter to Trump dated 1 December, according to Fox News, which first reported his resignation. Atlas, a neuroradiologist, apologised on Twitter this month for giving an interview to Russia\u2019s Kremlin-backed television station RT, saying he was unaware it was a registered foreign agent in the United States. Atlas has been sharply criticised by public health experts, including Anthony Fauci, the leading US infectious disease expert, for providing Trump with misleading or incorrect information on the virus pandemic. He has repeatedly downplayed the importance of face masks and this month said lockdowns had been \u201can epic failure\u201d in stopping its spread. His views on the handling the pandemic have been denounced by his peers at Stanford University\u2019s medical school and elsewhere. China has provided North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his family with an experimental coronavirus vaccine, a US analyst said on Tuesday, citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources. Reuters: Harry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said the Kims and several senior North Korean officials had been vaccinated. It was unclear which company had supplied its drug candidate to the Kims and whether it had proven to be safe, he added. North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections, but South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China - the source of the pandemic - before shutting the border in late January. Microsoft said last month that two North Korean hacking groups had tried to break into the network of vaccine developers in multiple countries, without specifying the companies targeted. Sources told Reuters they included British drugmaker AstraZeneca. The NIS said last week it had foiled North Korea\u2019s attempts to hack into South Korean Covid-19 vaccine makers. The World Tourism Organization called Monday for the standardisation of traveller health checks and the establishment of air corridors to ease international travel during the pandemic, AFP reports. The call came at a conference in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands as the global tourism industry reels from a year in which travel restrictions to slow the coronavirus pandemic have decimated the sector. \u201cWe call for the adoption of international protocols for Covid-19 tests before departure and the acceptance of the results upon arrival,\u201d the UN body said in joint statement with the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) and the Spanish tourism ministry. The statement came at the end of a one-day conference grouping representatives of more than 95 countries and more than 100 companies that was held in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria. It also called for agreements to develop \u201cinternational travel corridors to facilitate tourism and business travel between countries and cities with similar epidemiological situations\u201d. The text also warned that until a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 was widely available, \u201ctens of millions of jobs (in tourism) would likely be lost\u201d. And it called for \u201can international standard for contact tracing\u201d. Just over a month ago, the WTO said international tourists arrivals plunged by an annualised 70 percent during the first eight months of 2020 because of the pandemic. After a Thanksgiving weekend when the number of people traveling through US airports reached its highest since mid-March, a top government official said on Monday some Americans could begin receiving coronavirus vaccinations before Christmas, Reuters reports. US Health Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer Inc\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine could be authorised and shipped within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration tasked with reviewing trial data and recommending whether it warrants approval. A vaccine from Moderna Inc could follow a week later, he said, after the company announced on Monday it would apply for US and European emergency authorization. Final trial data showed the vaccine to be 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19, comparable with Pfizer\u2019s results. \u201cSo we could be seeing both of these vaccines out and getting into people\u2019s arms before Christmas,\u201d Azar said on CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning.\u201d The federal government will ship the vaccines. State governors will decide how they are distributed within their states. The United States has reported 4.2 million new Covid-19 cases so far in November and more than 36,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalizations are at a pandemic high and deaths the most in six months. Samoa\u2019s two positive Covid-19 cases have been declared historical cases and not infectious. The cases were detected in a 70-year-old who had travelled from Melbourne in Australia, and a sailor repatriated from Italy. Both Samoan citizens arrived in Apia on a repatriation flight on November 13, and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus. But further examination of their cases has found they were both historical: the sailor had the virus in May and the Australian-based man in August. Blood samples from the two cases were sent to New Zealand: results showed low viral counts for both, and the cases were deemed not to be infectious. Samoa\u2019s director-general of health, Leausa Dr Take Naseri, said the two positive cases, and the rest of the 274 passengers who arrived in Samoa on the same flight, will have to remain in quarantine for an additional seven days as a precaution. Leausa said all front-line workers at the airport, including health staff, police, and airport crew had been tested and cleared of the coronavirus. Samoa has recorded no other cases of the coronavirus. Elsewhere in the Pacific, the Mariana Islands has recorded 106 cases, 80 of which have been imported to the islands, mainly from the US mainland and the US territory of Guam. Fiji has recorded four more cases, all in border quarantine. But French Polynesia, one of the worst affected territories in the Pacific, has surpassed 14,000 cases, and 73 deaths. 82 people remain in hospital, including 21 in intensive care.
