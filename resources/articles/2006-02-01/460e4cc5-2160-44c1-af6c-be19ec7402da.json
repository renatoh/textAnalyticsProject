The admissions figures for students starting in October 2005 confirm the trend among several leading universities of increasing the number of fee-paying overseas students to balance their books. Oxford has announced its intention to increase overseas numbers and at the London School of Economics more than half of all students are from outside the UK. The money the universities receive for UK and European Union students does not cover their teaching costs, they insist, and the introduction of \u00a33,000 fees from September will not cover the gap. The Russell group of larger, research-intensive institutions has made no secret of its desire to see the cap lifted. Cambridge said today that a total of 14,343 students applied for places in the 2005 admissions round, down slightly from the record high of 14,684 in 2004. The number of accepted students rose to 3,378 (3,293 in 2004). Of those students taking A-levels, 94.0% gained straight As in their three best subjects excluding general studies, compared with 92.8% in 2004. The percentage of non-UK applications rose slightly to 24.6% (22.2% in 2004), but there was a jump of more than 3% in non-UK students accepted - 16.7% of acceptances compared with 13.4% in 2004. The figures show that the percentage of home students accepted from maintained school and colleges rose slightly to 58.1% (57.1% in 2004). There was also a small increase in the percentage of UK students accepted from lower social classes four to seven - they accounted for 12.7% of those students whose social class was known, compared with 12.4% the previous year. The balance shifted in favour of men - 51.3% of those accepted, compared with 47.8% in 2004. The percentage of non-white home students accepted, excluding those students who chose not to declare their ethnicity, rose to 13.6% (13.2% in 2004), while the percentage of students with disabilities was 3.5% (3.2% in 2004). Geoff Parks, the director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: \"We firmly believe that the UK's brightest students deserve the opportunity to study at Cambridge, regardless of their background. The very high quality and increasing diversity of Cambridge's student body shows that the sole criterion for admission is academic ability. No one should be deterred from applying here because of misplaced fears that their background will count against them, be it 'advantaged', 'disadvantaged' or somewhere in between.\" A university spokeswoman said Cambridge did not have a policy of admitting more overseas students for financial reasons. \"We are absolutely committed to remaining a 'home' university at undergraduate level and have no plans to alter our student balance. The increase in overseas students this year is just a reflection of the fact that we're attracting applications from some of the brightest students in the world - they're winning places on academic grounds,\" she said. There was no net gain at Cambridge to recruiting more overseas students, she added. The cost of educating them balanced the additional fee income overseas students brought in and about 50% of overseas undergraduates receive some form of financial support from the university. \u00b7 Information for prospective applicants - including details of open days, summer schools and other events, and an interactive film guide to admissions interviews - is available here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
