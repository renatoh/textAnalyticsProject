The gas company SGN said on Monday morning that it had turned off the gas to more than 3,000 homes since Sunday and would be going door to door to reach thousands more on Monday. Extra engineers have been drafted in from across Scotland to try and reach as many homes as possible. Temperatures in central Scotland were close to freezing overnight and around 4C on Monday morning. One local resident, David McCallan, told BBC Scotland that his home was like an \u201cice box\u201d when he woke up on Monday morning, until he switched on a heater supplied by SGN. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great heat but it\u2019s sufficient to keep myself and my wife warm enough.\u201d SGN has set up an information centre in a local community centre and promised that it would supply electric hot plates and heaters for residents \u201cwith young children, a disability, a long-term mental or physical condition, [or who] are a bit older or live with someone who is\u201d. The problem began on Sunday morning, when residents reported problems with their gas supplies. The company later said it had established that about 8,000 homes across the area were without gas after a fault at the \u201cgas governor\u201d. The governor is a piece of equipment that regulates pressure in the gas network, ensuring gas reaches homes at the correct pressure. Visits by engineers started again on Monday morning but SNG warned that in a worst case scenario it might take several days to reconnect supplies to all affected homes. Several schools will be closed while the problem is investigated. SGN said homes in Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir were affected. Local police said on Twitter: \u201cScottish Power is asking people in the Falkirk area is to be mindful of their electricity use over the coming days as there\u2019s increased demand on the electricity network with people using heaters while they\u2019re without gas. In a statement SNG said: \u201cBy the end of last night, our engineers had turned off gas supplies to more than 3,000 homes across the Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir areas of Falkirk. \u201cIt\u2019s likely it will be several more days until everyone\u2019s gas supplies are restored. In the meantime, we\u2019re continuing to work closely with Falkirk council and Police Scotland, as well as other local organisations, to support the community \u2013 prioritising those who are vulnerable to make sure they\u2019re well looked after while they\u2019re without gas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
