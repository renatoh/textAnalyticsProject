One more update \u2013 David Weir has qualified for the men\u2019s T54 400m final tomorrow by winning his heat. Fellow Britain Richard Chiassaro also made it through. I\u2019ll leave you with the day\u2019s main stories: Britain\u2019s Lauren Steadman narrowly pipped for PT4 triathlon gold Jonnie Peacock relieved after lucky charms are found on Rio track Cyclists and rowers lead way on another golden day for Britain Marieke Vervoort: now my fear of death is gone Paralympian Katie Kelly wins gold for Australia in Rio triathlon Richard Whitehead wins T42 200m gold for Britain Britain\u2019s Bethany Firth wins S14 200m freestyle title Britain\u2019s Bethany Firth is all smiles as she receives her S14 200m freestyle gold medal alongside her team-mate Jessica-Jane Applegate, who won in London but settles for silver this time. This, by Jacob Steinberg in Rio, is a highly recommended read on Marieke Vervoort, the Paralympian who signed euthanasia papers and regained control of her life in the process: The teenager Elliot got out in front at halfway and clung on, with her fellow 17-year-old Australian, Lakeisha Patterson, pipping Britain\u2019s Stephanie Millward to silver right at the wall. The women\u2019s equivalent race is up next and it is expected to be a battle between the US reigning champion Jessica Long and the Australian Maddison Elliot. Britain\u2019s Stephanie Millward is also likely to be in the mix. Josef Craig, who has had to contend with being moved to a more difficult classification since London 2012 where he won gold, reacts to his bronze medal: \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed not to get the win, but a personal best, that\u2019s good. It was horrible [being reclassified] but I\u2019m back on the podium and that\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d Wang goes out hard and gets to the turn first. No one can reel him in as he powers to victory in the final 50m but Britain\u2019s Josef Craig hangs in there to claim bronze behind Song Maodang. Next up is the men\u2019s S8 100m freestyle final, where Britain\u2019s Josef Craig arrives with the best qualifying time of 58.73 secs. His team-mate Oliver Hynd also has a shot at a medal but they will be wary of the man between them, Yinan Wang, one of three Chinese swimmers. Here they go. Back in the pool this is some achievement: Ukraine have swept the board in the men\u2019s SM10 200m IM final taking gold, silver and bronze. Ukraine are now four behind Britain\u2019s tally of 22 golds. Richard Whitehead after winning gold: \u201cToday was just about winning the race. I saw the finish line and had time to think. It\u2019s been such a long journey of ups and downs. It\u2019s my last 200m at the Paralympics. I\u2019ve got the 100m to go next \u2013 the 200m was my medal, but the 100m I\u2019m going to take off somebody else.\u201d Dave Henson speaks: \u201cFive and a half years ago I nearly died. My wife and daughter are watching at home. Words can\u2019t express how thankful I am for their support. Two years ago to the day I won gold in the very first Invictus Games in London. I gave smoking up and decided I was going to Rio. People said \u2018You\u2019re going to Tokyo [2020]\u2019 but I said \u2018I\u2019m going to Rio and I\u2019m going to medal\u2019. And here I am.\u201d Further good news for Britain as Dave Henson charged from the back of the field with 50m to go to claim the bronze medal. He\u2019s all smiles. He flies around the bend in the lead and doesn\u2019t look back, pointing to the crowd as he crosses the line with 10m in hand. A stunning performance by the 40-year-old who retains his crown from the 14-year-old taking silver, Ntando Mahlangu of South Africa. Next up, Richard Whitehead attempts to defend his T42 200m title. The American with his guide has just broken new ground in sprinting, becoming the first fully blind man to run sub-11 seconds, clocking 10.99. To run that time is impressive as it is \u2013 to do it without sight while strapped to another man is pretty spectacular. The crowd is excited for a Brazilian silver, too. The favourite Yunidis Castillo was out in front at 30m before pulling up with an injury, leaving the American Deja Young to power home to the 100m title \u2013 and the crowd roar as Brazilian De Jesus Correia is confirmed as the bronze medallist. Britain\u2019s teenager Polly Maton finished fifth. Over in the Olympic Stadium, Algeria\u2019s Abdellatif Baka has set a new world record to win the men\u2019s T12/13 1500m final! Next up is the men\u2019s and women\u2019s T45/46/47 100m finals followed by the men\u2019s T42 200m final where Britain\u2019s Richard Whitehead, the double amputee who won gold in London, will look to defend his title. This result came in a little earlier as Kelly and her sighted guide Michelle Jones pipped the British pair Alison Patrick and Melissa Reid. Here\u2019s our race report: Applegate is gutted to give up her Paralympic title but congratulates her team-mate Firth, who has claimed her second gold of these Games. A sensational swim by the 20-year-old from Northern Ireland who sets a new Paralympic record with an utterly dominant performance. Her team-mate Jessica-Jane Applegate wins silver and the Dutch swimmer Marlou Van Der Kulk takes bronze. No time to hang around, the women\u2019s event is up next. Britain have the two favourites in this one: Jessica-Jane Applegate and the world record holder Bethany Firth. They take up lanes four and five, and their biggest threat is the Swedish swimmer Pernilla Lindberg in three. Tang Wai Lok leads the way at the halfway point with Tom Hamer and Dan Fox half a length back. Hamer hits back in the final 50m but just runs out of pool, finishing second a couple of tenths behind Tang, with the Australian Dan Fox taking bronze. Hamer broke the world record in his heat but that was broken again a few minutes later by the Australian next to him in this final, Dan Fox. Here they go... Now comes the S14 200m freestyle for competitors with some intellectual impairment, and from a British perspective Tom Hamer is the big attraction. The 18-year-old is one of Britain\u2019s best hopes for gold in the pool \u2013 and has been using a superb hashtag in the buildup: Brazil also have an entrant in this one, Felipe Vila Real, so the atmosphere should be a cracker. Wow. Rebecca Redfern wipes two seconds off her world record, yet ends up only with silver. She must have thought it was good enough for gold but over in lane one Fotimakhon Amilova of Uzbekistan, who is only 15 years old (!), swam a stunning 1:12.45 to take the title by around a second. Next up in the pool is Britain\u2019s world record holder Rebecca Redfern. The 16-year-old, who has impaired vision, is competing in the SB13 100m breaststroke final against plenty of stiff competition. This should be a good one. Fedyna Oleksii wins the men\u2019s SB13 100m breaststroke final, taking Ukraine up to 17 golds. Ukraine finished fourth in London and Beijing \u2013 it\u2019s been a superb start to these Games and they are pushing to go a step better in Rio. Amy Marren speaks after winning her first Paralympic medal: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long four years, a lot of ups and downs, and to be in the top three tonight ... I can\u2019t stop crying! This year I\u2019ve found my love for swimming again. I\u2019m on top of the world.\u201d That is China\u2019s 32nd gold medal of these Games \u2013 utter dominance. Britain are the nearest challengers with 20, and Ukraine are third overall with 16 golds. What a race this is. The British teenager Amy Marren puts in a storming first three lengths and leads with 50m to go, but she doesn\u2019t quite have the strength to hold on to the win on the freestyle leg. Lin finishes just in front of Spain\u2019s Sarai Gascon, who pushes Marren back into bronze. Next up is the 18-year-old Briton Amy Marren in the SM9 200m IM final. She has a real chance of a medal having registered the third fastest time in the history of this event. Over to the pool, where so far tonight there have been golds for Sweden\u2019s Karl Forsman (men\u2019s SB5 100m breaststroke) and Yalyzaveta Mereshko of Ukraine (women\u2019s SB5 100m breaststroke), and the latest win has gone to Italy\u2019s Federico Morlacchi in the men\u2019s SM9 200m individual medley. He celebrates with punch of the water and a kiss to his supporters. Britain\u2019s James Crisp started well but faded to finish eighth. Tatyana McFadden speaks: \u201cI got a bad start, it took me about 200m to get going and I had to really rely on my kick.\u201d Given the eventual margin of victory, which was around 20m, that is ominous news for her rivals in her other events. \u201cToday I ran for America, for my family and friends back home.\u201d The second final on the track sees the American star pace her lap beautifully, gliding away from the rest in the final 150m to win the first of a potential six gold medals at these Games. McFadden\u2019s compatriot Cheri Madsen finished second, with Lihong Zou of China taking bronze. Wenjun Liu had blasted out of the blocks and seemed to be putting McFadden under pressure, but finished fifth. A magnanimous Sammi Kinghorn accepts defeat with grace and says she will come back stronger in the future. The Scot is only 20, so there is plenty of time for her to improve on that sixth-placed finish. Hongzhuan Zhou powers home in a world record time to bring China yet another gold \u2013 that\u2019s No 31. Chelsea McClammer of the USA zipped through late to pinch silver from Angela Ballard of Australia, the world champion, who took gold. Sammi Kinghorn, Britain\u2019s European record holder, couldn\u2019t quite keep pace and finished sixth. The women\u2019s T53 400m final is first up on the track. Britain\u2019s Sammi Kinghorn goes in lane 2 and has a great chance of a medal, but she\u2019s up against stiff competition including the reigning world champion Angela Ballard of Australia. As we near the start of the big races in the pool and on the track which will make a significant impact on the medals table by the end of the night, there is just time to nudge you in the direction of our main stories from the day so far: Britain\u2019s Lauren Steadman narrowly pipped for PT4 triathlon gold Rachel Morris leads the way as Britain win three Rio rowing golds Jonnie Peacock relieved after lucky charms are found on Rio track Cyclists and rowers lead way on another golden day for Britain And here is the full medal table for your perusal. China have another gold, and this one has gone to the powerlifter Yujiao Tan. She pulled off a huge world record lift of 135kg to win the women\u2019s 67kg title by some margin, with the silver going to Kazakhstan and bronze to Egypt. Whiley, by the way, will be almost straight back on court for her doubles quarter-final with Lucy Shuker against Chile. No wonder she powered through that second set. Britain seem to be going up against Brazil all over Rio today. In the women\u2019s wheelchair tennis second round, Jordanne Whiley has got the better of home favourite Natalia Mayara, winning 6-4, 6-1 to advance. Whiley was the 2015 US Open champion and got to the semi-finals at Wimbledon a few weeks ago. In men\u2019s 5-aside football, Brazil\u2019s captain and star striker Ricardinho has given his side the lead against Turkey. Having won their first game against Morocco 3-1, Brazil will go top of Group A should they win this one too. Britain have indeed lost their mixed boccia semi-final to Brazil, despite a late rally, and will face Thailand in the bronze medal match tomorrow at 11am (3pm BST). Brazil will play Slovakia for the gold. In men\u2019s wheelchair basketball, Brazil are 69-40 ahead of Iran with only five minutes to play in their Group B contest. The marathon women\u2019s second round tennis match between Zhu of China and South Africa\u2019s Montjane is still going, two and a half hours later. The end was in sight when Montjane served for the match a moment ago, leading 4-6, 6-4, 5-3, but Zhu broke back and they go on. While there is a bit of a lull in the action before things get going in the pool and on the track, let me point you towards a piece by Jacob Steinberg in Rio today, and the case of Jonnie Peakcock\u2019s lucky charms: Brazil are giving Britain a lesson in Boccia right now. They are 4-0 up with only one end remaining and it looks like curtains for the British mixed team of Evie Edwards, Stephen McGuire and Kieran Steer in this semi-final. If you\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019m wittering on about, wonder no more: Something else to keep an eye on is the women\u2019s second round wheelchair tennis match between Zhu Zhenzhen of China (a passionate advocate of the Z before H rule) and South Africa\u2019s Kgothatso Montjane. It has developed into a bit of slugfest, with the competitors having been on court for two hours already. Zhu won the first set 6-4 but lost the second by the same scoreline \u2013 they are on serve in the third and final set. Some medals on the line right now: the women\u2019s 67kg powerlifting final has just got under way. Chile\u2019s Maria Ortiz is leading but its early days. And starting shortly is the table tennis singles final between Natalia Kosmina of Ukraine and her European neighbour Krystyna Siemieniecka of Poland, a passionate advocate of the I before E rule. Iran are having an up and down start to the evening. Their mixed archery team have just pipped Britain in a thriller which went all the way to a shootout, and booked their place in the semi-finals in the process. However, in their Group B men\u2019s basketball battle with Brazil, they are 39-19 down in the second quarter. The leaders in Group B, Britain, play second-placed USA tomorrow evening. Britain\u2019s David Weir will race tonight in the T54 400m heats, attempting to add to his haul of six Paralympic gold medals. Weir will be sure to have a big smile on his face having just announced the birth of his fourth child: By the way, if you missed yesterday\u2019s action doing Saturday things then here is a handy video for UK readers/viewers to get you up to speed: For those outside the UK, apologies. I hope this makes up for it: It hasn\u2019t been a scintillating start to the Paralympic Games for the USA but they have come into their own in the women\u2019s triathlon events today, edging Britain\u2019s Lauren Steadman into silver in the process. Here\u2019s our man in Rio, Jacob Steinberg, with more: There are a whole host of different table tennis early round matches going on right now. One man who has put himself in a final is Britain\u2019s Will Bayley: Will Bayley advanced to the S7 singles table tennis final, which takes place on Monday. His opponent will be Brazil\u2019s Israel Stroh. Bayley claimed London 2012 silver and will bid to go one better after beating Jordi Morales from Spain 3-1 with his fourth match point in the semi-final. The 28-year-old from Tunbridge Wells said: \u201cI just snatched a bit at the match points because I was a bit nervous and if I had lost the fourth it would have been anyone\u2019s game in the fifth. He\u2019s one of my favourite players - he\u2019s a superb player. \u201cIt is going to be a different final to London - less pressure on me - but I\u2019m just looking forward to it. Stroh has played superbly and beaten a lot of good players. I believe I can beat him but we\u2019ll see.\u201d Rob Davies is also guaranteed a medal and will play for gold in the S1 singles event. He will face South Korea\u2019s Joo Young Dae on Tuesday. Barnsley\u2019s Sue Gilroy lost her semi-final and will compete for Class 4 singles bronze on Monday against Nadia Matic from Serbia. There are plenty more medals up for grabs in Rio this evening. Much of the action will be in the pool and on the track (and field), but there are several table tennis finals to be settled, as well as archery and powerlifting. Here are some highlights to look out for: 7.40pm BST (3.40pm in Rio) Britain face Brazil in the BC4 mixed pairs Boccia semi-final 8.30pm Table tennis gold medal matches 9.30pm Swimming finals include GB\u2019s Becky Redfern in 100m breastroke and Amy Marren in the 200m IM 9.30pm In athletics, USA star Tatyana McFadden goes for first of six golds in women\u2019s T54 400m 10.30pm GB\u2019s Olivia Breen leaps in the women\u2019s T38 long jump final 10.30pm More swimming finals including Jessica-Jane Applegate and Bethany Firth going head to head in the S14 200m final Hello! Welcome along to coverage all the main action in Rio this evening. Before taking a peak at what\u2019s to come, a look at what has gone on today \u2013 for those of a British persuasion, it has been another impressive day with three rowing golds and two more in the velodrome to take GB\u2019s tally to 20, and 46 overall. Amongst the winners was Rachel Morris, 37, who became a Paralympic champion in her second sport after adding single sculls gold to her cycling time-trial in Beijing eight years ago. Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley won in the mixed double sculls before the mixed coxless fours grabbed more glory. In cycling, Britain rode to the men\u2019s mixed sprint team gold with the riders Jody Cundy, Jon Allan-Butterworth and Louis Rolfe setting a world record time in beating the defending champions, China. That came on the back of a surprise win for Lora Turnham and her pilot Corrine Hall, who were all smiles as they admitted they were stunned to beat the favourites from New Zealand in the women\u2019s tandem B 3km pursuit final. Other notable moments in Rio today include the women\u2019s triathlon, the first time the event has been staged in a Paralympic Games. The PT4 was won by Grace Norman of the USA who edged out Britain\u2019s Lauren Steadman, while Allysa Seely won the PT2 event in an American 1-2-3. Lucy Ejike won the women\u2019s 61kg powerlifting title for Nigeria earlier in the day, while in athletics Thailand\u2019s Prawat Wahoram won his country\u2019s second gold of the Games in the men\u2019s T54 5000m final. China continued their dominance with Juan Yao claiming women\u2019s F44 discus gold, but the loudest cheer of the day so far was saved for Brazil\u2019s Petrucio Ferreira Dos Santos, who stormed to gold in the men\u2019s T47 100m final. What has all that done to the medal table? Well China are still well out in front with GB second and Ukraine third, as Brazil leap to fifth overall.
