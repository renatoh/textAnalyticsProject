Instinctively, Baptista is opposed to the move and though he has been told he is unlikely to play many games for the Bernab\u00e9u club this season, he would prefer to remain and fight for a place than to transfer to White Hart Lane. \"I have said 300 times that I don't want to leave Madrid,\" said Baptista. Spurs might find it easier to persuade Baptista to swap La Liga for the Premiership if they can prepare an attractive offer financially. However, Baptista earns marginally more than \u00a320,000 per week after tax; if Tottenham were to improve significantly on that figure, it would make him among the highest earners at the north London club. Indeed it is not entirely clear that the Spurs' board is willing to commit large sums for a player who fulfils a role for which they are well covered. The 24-year-old, who can play as an attacking midfielder or forward, interested Spurs last year, prompting a \u00a315.7m bid to his former club, Sevilla. Then, Tottenham's chances of landing the player collapsed along with those of Arsenal after Real Madrid made their move, signing the player for \u00a313m. Baptista was particularly keen to extend his residency in Spain to qualify for an EU passport. Having satisfied the qualification requirements, his application is now being processed by the Spanish government, but whether it would be adversely affected by a transfer out of the country is a moot point that is occupying his lawyers' thoughts. It is likely that Tottenham's recent tradition of leaving deals until the last hours of the transfer window will persist and should they decide to pursue their negotiations with Madrid they would expect to drive the fee significantly below Real's valuation. It will also depend on whether Spurs enjoy success in their other moves. Intriguingly the manager Martin Jol is believed to have been out of the country after Tuesday 2-0 win over Sheffield United, and can be expected to have used the time tracking transfer targets. The positions Jol is most eager to fill are striker, left-wing and right-back. Baptista, used to attacking the ball from deep-lying positions, does not have the experience of playing as a front-line target man. One option that Spurs had been exploring for that role was Mido, whose loan from Roma expired this summer. However, chances of securing that deal are fading as the Serie A club resist the proposed \u00a33m transfer on the grounds that it will be difficult to locate a replacement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
