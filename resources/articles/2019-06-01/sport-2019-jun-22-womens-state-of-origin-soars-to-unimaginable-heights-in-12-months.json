By kick-off, the mercury had dropped to 11 degrees, yet a queue of people awaiting admission stretched nearly 100m down Miller Street. In 12 months, this game has soared to unimaginable heights and those in attendance were lending their unconditional support. Fourteen-year-old Jackson Terry of North Sydney said he was drawn to the game through increased publicity and a love of the Blues (note there is no asterisk on Blues, no definition of men or women, just Blues). \u201cTheir skills are admirable and nothing short of outstanding,\u201d Jackson said as the players completed their pre-game warm-up. The Year 9 student and Under-15s rugby league junior attends women\u2019s sport on a semi-regular basis, especially women\u2019s cricket played on the same oval. \u201cWomen\u2019s sport is heading in the right direction really quickly. It is terrific especially with [tennis player] Ash Barty leading the way and the Matildas doing so well in the World Cup.\u201d The Matildas \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s most successful teams at present \u2013 have overcome early tournament jitters to find themselves among the last 16 teams at the Fifa World Cup, earning the right to play Norway on Sunday morning. Comeback queen Barty won the French Open earlier this month and has taken the same form into the Birmingham Classic. The 24-year-old defeated Venus Williams on Saturday morning to move into the semi-finals and one step closer to a tournament win which will see her top the world rankings; a position no Australian woman has held for over 40 years. But on Friday all eyes were on Women\u2019s Origin \u2013 plenty of them, given it was broadcast on prime-time television and an audience of a million-plus tuned in. Former footballer and softball player, Jasmin Kitching, said she was \u201cblown away\u201d by her first experience of women\u2019s elite rugby league. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it would be televised and thought if it was, it would be on SBS or played late,\u201d Kitching said. \u201cBut when I found out it was live on Channel 9, I thought this is so good. With women, it has been hard with everything, let alone sport, so this is massive.\u201d The interstate clash brought together a solid list of league administrators and senior politicians who were treated as virtual celebrities in an emphatic crowd. Among them was Stuart Clark, the former Australian cricketer and NSW Rugby League\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful for everyone from the pre-game to the game, to two to three thousand people mobbing the girls after the game,\u201d Stuart said as thousands burst on to the oval at full-time to meet their Origin heroines. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly here to stay. While everyone says [women\u2019s league] is a growth area, it is also about equality; about giving these girls an opportunity that in the past, they wouldn\u2019t have got.\u201d Completely swamped somewhere in the centre of the on-field celebrations was diminutive NSW halfback Maddie Studdon. Having been awarded the Nellie Doherty medal for best-on-field just moments earlier, her grandfather, John Hurst proudly looked on as his granddaughter signed endless autographs and was photographed with her adoring fans. Hurst, a former South Sydney Rabbitohs trainer, finds himself in an era he could have never dreamed of. \u201cI think whoever organised the women\u2019s game, people such as Katie Page [CEO of Harvey Norman, a major sponsor of women\u2019s league] should be congratulated,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight was a great spectacle, the crowd was enormous. Hopefully along the track we might not get just one State of Origin game for the women, but a series like the men.\u201d In days gone by, sceptics of women\u2019s sport were fixated on an imbalance of physical strength but over time, many are recognising this genre\u2019s aura of excitement, wholesomeness and determination which resonate widely. It\u2019s a recipe which has seen audiences grow in key sectors such as netball, AFL and more recently, league. It\u2019s now not a case of whether the women should play a curtain raiser during the year, but where next year\u2019s Origin will be held seeing North Sydney Oval could barely hold last night\u2019s crowd and once again, food supplies were exhausted in the first half. \u201cIt is a really big thing for both teams to sell out a crowd, this game is going huge places,\u201d said the Maroons captain, Ali Brigginshaw, after the 14-4 loss to NSW. \u201cI had half of the women\u2019s rugby 7s message me before the game to say good luck. We are all supporting each other to get through hurdles and stand on top of the stage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
