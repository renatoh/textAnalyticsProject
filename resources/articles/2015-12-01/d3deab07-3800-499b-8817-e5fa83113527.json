The visitors, buzzing after thrashing Arsenal on Boxing Day, created enough chances to win several matches and Ronald Koeman cannot have imagined that he would end up sighing that \u201cfootball is 90 or 95 minutes\u201d after the quality of his team\u2019s football in the first half. West Ham, however, showed spirit and togetherness to withstand Southampton\u2019s onslaught before emerging with renewed purpose after the break to win for the first time in nine matches and overcome an injury list that meant they were without half a team. For all the good fortune of Michail Antonio\u2019s bizarre equaliser, Bilic made positive tactical alterations at half-time and one of them was the introduction of Andy Carroll, who headed in the decisive goal on his return from a groin strain. Carroll has his faults but he also scored the winner in West Ham\u2019s previous victory, the 2-1 win over Chelsea on 24 October, and Southampton struggled to deal with his threat in the air. \u201cWe lost more balls and we did more mistakes,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we lost today.\u201d Bilic, who expects Dimitri Payet to return for the visit of Liverpool on Saturday, admitted that his team could not have played much worse in the first half and, taking Southampton\u2019s long spells of superiority into account, it is slightly incongruous that West Ham are up to seventh, even though they are unbeaten in six matches now. Carl Jenkinson, deputising for Aaron Cresswell at left-back, was an obvious weak link in an unfamiliar position and the manner of Southampton\u2019s goal in the 13th minute was troubling for Bilic, given how straightforward it was for Shane Long to win a header in front of James Collins, race on to Steven Davis\u2019s pass and slide a low centre into the six-yard box. Dusan Tadic attacked it and his touch went in off Jenkinson. West Ham were overrun in midfield, simple passes went astray and they struggled to get out of their half after falling behind, let alone threaten the Southampton goal. The visitors had 10 shots in the first half. There were mitigating circumstances for West Ham, who were also missing Victor Moses, Winston Reid and Diafra Sakho, yet Southampton failed to kill the game off. Carroll and Manuel Lanzini replaced Mauro Zarate and Alex Song, while Jenkinson was more comfortable after switching positions with James Tomkins. The changes led to an improvement and West Ham\u2019s persistence was rewarded when they equalised with one of the strangest goals Upton Park has seen. Antonio struggled to explain how he scored his first West Ham goal after he took advantage of slack defending from Cuco Martina, fell over a risky challenge from Jos\u00e9 Fonte in the area and then found himself celebrating when Victor Wanyama\u2019s attempted clearance deflected off his head and looped over Maarten Stekelenburg in the 69th minute. Ten minutes later, Antonio then played a part in West Ham\u2019s winner, meeting Enner Valencia\u2019s cross with a header that crashed off the bar and rebounded to Carroll, who nodded the ball past Stekelenburg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
