George W. Bush wanted to personally thank the British Prime Minister for his words of support. 'Shoulder to shoulder', in particular, was a phrase he liked. He also wanted to discuss tactics. It was Bush's second call to Blair in three days. Both had focused on Afghanistan and the immediate aftermath of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. But a few vital minutes of each conversation suggested that something else was on Bush's mind as well as the Taliban and how best to defeat al-Qaeda. The issue was Iraq. Blair told Bush that America could rely on Britain's 'unswerving support'. He also said that building an international coalition for the War on Terror was essential. He and Bush also discussed for the first time the 'ripple effect' of world diplomacy and the fight against terrorism. It was like a pebble dropped in the water. 'We focus on the first circle,' Bush said to Blair. 'Then expand to the next circle and then the next.' Osama bin Laden was in the first circle. Saddam Hussein was in the second. It is still unclear who is in the third. Blair agreed. He also had a final piece of advice. Whatever you decide to do, ensure that you know the destination you want to get to and stick steadfastly to that course. Do not be deflected and remain single-minded. Bush agreed '100 per cent'. The Prime Minister's foreign policy, in sharp contrast to his domestic efforts trying to turn around the NHS or deal with spiralling crime, is based on a black-and-white analysis. Saddam was in breach of UN resolutions, Blair believed. This issue had to be dealt with, Blair believed. By the United Nations route if possible; by force if necessary. In November 1997, years before talk of second resolutions and Prime Ministers with their whole political future on the line, Blair had been asked by Tam Dalyell during Prime Minister's Questions what his view was of the latest compromise deal offered to Saddam over the expulsion of UN weapons inspectors. 'It is absolutely essential that he backs down on this, that he be made to back down,' Blair told a packed House of Commons. 'If he does not we will simply face this problem, perhaps in a far worse form, in a few years' time.' Three days earlier in Downing Street, in an interview for the BBC's On the Record, Blair had told John Humphrys: 'The UN resolution passed in 1991 made it absolutely clear that UN weapons inspectors were to go in and were to stay until all those weapons of mass destruction were eliminated and the potential for developing them eliminated. 'Our view is that we have to make sure that resolution is carried. We want to do it diplomatically, but have to reserve the option of force if diplomatic means fail.' He could have spoken the words yesterday. For six years, most of them inactive on Saddam's part, Blair's strategy has been that he wants to travel the UN route against Saddam, but only if it is a way of ensuring action rather than endless inaction. Just as he advised Bush; decide on a course of action and stick to it. Through thick and an awful lot of thin. On a freezing cold day in February 2001, Blair and Bush met for the first time at Camp David. Blair was responding to a personal invitation from the new President. He was the first world leader to be asked to Bush's Maryland retreat. The agenda faxed through to Downing Street a few days earlier had an issue typed out in bold print which might have caught some observers by surprise. Iraq was to be a major spine of the discussion. The two spent an hour talking about the issue. Bush told Blair he wanted to warn the Iraqi dictator that he should not 'cross any line or test our will'. Blair, long wedded to a 'diplomacy backed by force' route on Iraq, suddenly realised that an American president was contemplating action against the Iraqi dictator. Even Clinton, long-time friend and fellow Third Way traveller, had been ambivalent on Saddam. 'It was a confluence of thinking,' said one Whitehall official closely involved with British policy on the War on Terrorism and action against Iraq. 'We realised that here was someone who was going to back with military force what we had been saying for years. It was quite an eye- opener.' For Sir Christopher Meyer, then British ambassador to Washington, the first summit was a triumph of 'slow burn' diplomacy. Before Bush had even announced his candidacy, Meyer made two lengthy trips to Austin, Texas in 1999 to sound out the man who would in two years lead the world's only hyper-power. Meyer also made it his business to get to know Condoleezza Rice, Wolfowitz, and Rumsfeld. Rice, in particular, would be the link between the White House and Downing Street, speaking to Blair's leading foreign policy adviser, Sir David Manning, on an almost daily basis. Manning will be moving to Washington as ambassador in the summer. Those outside the inner circle thought that Blair and Bush would never get on. But Meyer briefed Blair in detail on Bush's direct personality and warned the Prime Minister not to under-estimate the folksy Texan style. Bush liked to see himself as a doer. So did Blair. From the first moment the two men met on that cold winter's morning and agreed to call each other by their first names, they realised that, at least on the big issue of Iraq, they were singing from the same hymn sheet. Travelling back from a later summit Blair, speaking to his closest officials in the first class area at the front of the British Airways 777, said that he was amazed at the image that the British public had of Bush as some knuckle-dragging semi-ape who couldn't string a sentence together. 'He is very easy to do business with,' he told those around him. 'He gets to the point and is consistent.' When Blair backed Bush on the issue of Iraq, the President hand-wrote a note to the Prime Minister. 'I like your style,' it said. It is known as a 'trial balloon' - a last-ditch attempt to float an idea and see whether anyone shoots it down. Any nation that feels the need to use its final option at the United Nations is a country on paper thin ice. Britain launched its trial balloon last Wednesday. For Blair the British 'second resolution' on military action against Iraq has become the marker, for his critics at least, of success or failure on his policy on Saddam. In an emotional and heartfelt interview with the BBC's Westminster Hour last weekend Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, threatened to resign if Britain failed to secure UN backing for military action. She admitted later that many of her colleagues probably found her 'irritating', but that it was time to speak her mind. France and Russia say they are implacably opposed. Robin Cook, the Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, struck an equally sceptical tone at a tense 70-minute meeting of the Cabinet last Thursday. Speculation is rife that he, too, may quit if the Security Council fails to endorse a second resolution. When Blair entered Cabinet and said hello to his colleagues, he was greeted by a chorus of 'bonjours'. It was one of the few lighter moments. In a final attempt to bring enough members of the Security Council on board last week, the Prime Minister authorised the publication of 'six tests', a final set of deadlines which Saddam must meet if the Iraqi dictator is to avoid military attack. The balloon was unveiled late on Wednesday night, so hastily cobbled together that the space where the date by which Saddam should have shown 'full and final compliance' had been left blank. For weeks Whitehall sources had been briefing that there was no need for new deadlines as it was clear what Saddam had to do - get rid of his weapons of mass destruction. But that all changed. The second resolution has become essential to the Prime Minister's political future. Fail and the political storm will be as long as it is dangerous. Succeed and he will be lauded as a leader of courage and conviction. For the first time in his political career, there is serious discussion about a 'nightmare scenario' - that the Prime Minister fails to get a second resolution, that members of his Cabinet resign, that the military action becomes bogged down in the searing heat of an Iraqi summer and that Blair, facing massive rebellion within his own party, finally falls on his sword. But Blair has that 'black-and-white' analysis of foreign policy. Alight on a strategy and stick to it. Rebellions will come, and rebellions will go, and in the end you have to believe in what you are doing. At the outset of the debate on Iraq, Number 10 was convinced that they would defeat the two major domestic hurdles to a politically 'safe' military campaign. Public opinion would be won round. Labour Party opinion would be similarly malleable. Downing Street alighted on the idea of a 'dossier'. As spring finally blossomed last year, Number 10 prepared to unveil its secret weapon to convince doubters that Iraq was a clear and present danger that needed to be acted against in the immediate future. The Iraqi dossier would be Blair's saving grace against all those critical of his policy. Publication was set for 25 March, two weeks before Blair's third trip to America to discuss Iraq. A week earlier, in his office behind the Speaker's chair in the House of Commons, Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, had called together a select group of Labour backbench MPs with expertise in military and defence issues, to 'test out' a small portion of the report, the first three pages which would make up the opening chapter of the evidence against Saddam. The Government's belief in 'dossier politics' - a neutral assessment of a situation stamped with the authority of the security and intelligence services - had grown since the publication of a similar report against bin Laden the year before. But what Downing Street appeared to have failed to factor in was that, although most people in the world had little knowledge of bin Laden, the operations of al-Qaeda or the internal and brutal politics of Afghanistan, the world was stuffed full of experts on Iraq who could smell the whiff of an overplayed hand from a mile away. The MPs read the three-page extract and shook their heads in mild disbelief. None of them was signed up opponents of the Blairite policy on Iraq, but they bluntly warned Straw that what they had read was 'pretty unconvincing', a mish-mash of historical evidence and vague intelligence briefings which did not provide, in their opinion, a convincing case against Saddam. Straw reported back to Number 10. Downing Street, fearing egg on their face, pulled the document. Whitehall officials were told to try and find some 'better evidence'. By September they thought they had it. A few days before it was published, Blair had again flown into Andrews Air Force Base near Washington to meet the President. Over a working dinner of tortilla soup, grilled swordfish and saffron pearl barley, again at Camp David, the two men had discussed the dossier of evidence against Iraq. Bush told Blair that he thought its publication would be 'very helpful'. The dossier was published to a huge fanfare two weeks later. Downing Street officials said it would 'dramatically move' public opinion which had been steadfastly against military action against Iraq, particularly without UN backing. It would also convince the doubters on the backbenches. It immediately ran into trouble. Experts on Iraqi policy dismissed many of its claims of Saddam's nuclear capabilities and biological and chemical weapons as out of date or already well known. Two weeks later, standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin, Blair's smile froze as it was made clear that Putin had yet to be convinced. 'Fears are one thing, hard facts are another,' the Russian leader said, before the two men turned and walked back to the President's dacha retreat outside Moscow. Jacques Chirac was similarly unimpressed, saying the dossier offered 'no proof, only indications'. The Government tried again and again. In December last year the Foreign Office published a document on human rights abuses in Iraq. Immediately the same dismissal came from experts - unconvincing and out of date. Richard Bunting, a spokesman for the human rights group, Amnesty, said: 'We are afraid this is opportunistic and selective. Iraq's human rights record is appalling but we have been saying this for years.' Then last month came yet another 'collection of evidence', pushed under journalists' hotel doors in Washington shortly after dawn. The reporters were waiting to join the Prime Minister on his sixth trip to Washington in the first week of February when they received the report claiming Iraqi deception and avoidance of the inspections regime. Claiming to be based on 'latest intelligence information, ' it appeared water-tight until a lecturer from Cambridge University, Glen Rangwala, noticed that much of it had been lifted either from a Californian post-graduate's article on Iraq which relied on data from the early 1990s or had been directly copied from intelligence briefings from the publicly-available Jane's Intelligence Review. Alastair Campbell, Blair's Director of Strategy and Communications, who had been involved in drawing up the document, later admitted to colleagues that there were 'drafting issues' with the report, which soon became known as the 'dodgy dossier'. 'The substance, though,' he said, 'was correct.' The problem was, few of the people Blair was trying to win around really believed him. The rumblings of discontent started a year ago. On the comfortable peach sofa of GMTV, Chris Smith, the former Culture Secretary and man described as a 'bellwether' MP who marks the mood of the party, settled down to launch the first small-arms fire. He said he believed many party colleagues 'would be worried if there were something being contemplated which was an all-out invasion of Iraq simply going on the coat-tails of an American unilateral decision'. At this stage it was small beer, but, where a red light should have started glowing on the 'problems ahead' desk at Number 10, they decided that the force of their argument would snuff out the opposition. Bush had already made clear that after the war against Afghanistan, he wanted to move on to what America considered threats to world peace. His 'axis of evil' speech earlier in 2002 had linked Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Blair had visited Bush again at the White House in November 2001, where Bush had said action against Iraq, whether through the UN or militarily, was inevitable. Blair, referring to his earlier pronouncements on the issue, had concurred. There were two immediate problems for Blair. First the British did not back America's policy for regime change and the end of Saddam's rule. Senior figures in Downing Street admitted early on that this was a 'point of difference'. Second, British intelligence was unconvinced by US claims that there was a direct link between al-Qaeda, Iraq and 11 September. Whereas Bush said that they were inseparable, Blair had to make the slightly more nuanced argument that Iraq was a supporter of terrorism in one form or another and that if rogue states had weapons of mass destruction it was only a matter of time before they either used them themselves or found some way of supporting terrorist organisations that wanted to. Smith had touched a nerve of concern within Labour MPs, many of whom were being inundated with letters and emails opposed to military action against Iraq. Some were also fighting for re-selection for their seats and were being pressurised by Labour Party activists in their own constituencies to back more time for the weapons inspectors. At first, Number 10 was satisfied that the rebellion could be contained to the 'usual suspects', the 40 or so left-wing MPs who stood in regular opposition to the Prime Minister and whole New Labour project. In a vote in September, 56 Labour MPs voted against the Government. The same month, more than 160 MPs signed a Commons motion expressing 'deep unease' about military action in Iraq. Blair was heckled by his own side during Prime Minister's Questions and slow hand-clapped by a group of women opposed to the war during a television debate. Despite a whirlwind of television interviews, speeches, and even the ill-fated dossiers, he was failing to convince the doubters. When the Speaker called for the Moment of Interruption - the time when a debate in the Commons is brought to a halt and a vote taken - the Government knew it was in trouble. Last month's historic Iraq vote saw 122 Labour MPs stand against the Blairite line. There might be a case for military action at some point in the future, the MPs argued, but it certainly wasn't yet. It could be the high-water mark of any rebellion. Some were talking excitedly last week of leadership challenges and of Blair's last weeks. But with the threat to his leadership becoming more apparent, last week saw a move back by the party. At a packed meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party last Wednesday morning, Diana Organ MP made an impassioned plea for a little loyalty to a Prime Minister who, if nothing else, has remained consistent in the face of barrage after barrage of attack. Many MPs nodded in sage agreement. Blair himself has told friends that he believes public opinion is persuadable and that behind the bald polling figures many are still concerned about the threat Saddam poses and what the issue dealt with. Blair knows that ever since that phone call with Bush after 11 September, and that first meeting the February before, Iraq has been on America's agenda. And if it is on America's agenda, it is on everyone's agenda. Blair has pushed America to use the UN when at first they were reluctant to do so. Now it is reaching the endgame. Blair says Saddam has had enough time. Bush says Saddam has had enough time. Now it is only the threat of a continued inspection process dragging on that could forestall a reckoning. \u00b7 Observer reporting team: Peter Beaumont in Amman, Paul Harris in Kuwait, Ed Vulliamy in New York, James Meek in Kuwait, Jason Burke in Northern Ireland, Paul Webster in Paris, Burhan Wazir in Kuwait and Kamal Ahmed in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
