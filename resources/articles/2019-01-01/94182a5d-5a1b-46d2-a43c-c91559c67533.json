The England coach was speaking after listening to the Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa reveal that he had spied on Championship rival clubs all season. \u201cHe was telling everyone what everyone does,\u201d said Jones. \u201cFifteen years ago, we used to send people out in costumes to watch training \u2013 it used to be part of the pre-match brief then. I can remember sending a coach who is now in a very senior position dressed like a swagman to watch one team train and he got chased out of there. \u201cYou do not need to do it now because you see everything now in a game. I have been coaching for 20 years and it has always been going on but I can say with a hand on my heart, we don\u2019t do it any more. We don\u2019t see the value of it because we can glean most of the stuff from games now.\u201d Jones accepted spying could become an issue in the World Cup with some training grounds surrounded by high-rise buildings, adding: \u201cWe will have the security we need, but I don\u2019t want to get to the extent where we go to the team room and we\u2019re putting Blu Tack on the keyhole or looking under seats for tape recorders. It creates a sense of paranoia.\u201d Jones pointed out that spying was not always covert. \u201cI was having a coffee with [assistant] Steve Borthwick in South Africa and a bloke comes out with a camera and starts trying to take photos of all our notes. You can be too obsessed about it, just do what you can to protect what is important.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
