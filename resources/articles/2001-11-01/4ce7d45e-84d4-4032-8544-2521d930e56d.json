Holdsworth scored and helped to create Bolton's opener, floating an innocuous looking cross into the penalty area, where Akinori Nishizawa did well to outmanoeuvre Paul Williams, who held him back and conceded a 54th-minute penalty that Holdsworth despatched comfortably. The visitors' two goals both came from unlikely sources. Their second came from a defender while Kevin Davies, scorer of their first 10 minutes from the end of normal time, had not scored since January. The second-half substitute reacted quickest to hook home James Beattie's cross. Michael Ricketts put Bolton back in front within minutes of his own introduction in place of Holdsworth in extra time when he collected Nicky Southall's intelligent pass just inside the Southampton half and advanced fully 60 yards before slotting the ball past Jones. But one minute later Southampton responded through Tahar El-Khalej, who took advantage of a lapse in concentration in the Bolton defence to sweep home from 12 yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
