Alisson has been sidelined since the opening game of the campaign against Norwich, when he damaged a calf muscle while taking a goal kick, and Liverpool have been reluctant to put a precise time-frame on his recovery. That remains the case although the manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp has admitted he does not expect the Brazil international to return until after the next international break in mid-October. Liverpool have an intensive workload of seven matches before the October internationals including Premier League games against Newcastle, Chelsea, Sheffield United and Leicester plus Champions League fixtures with Napoli and Red Bull Salzburg. Alisson\u2019s target for a comeback will be the visit to Manchester United on 20 October but Klopp will not take any risks with the fitness of the \u00a365m keeper. \u201cHe\u2019s improving but we cannot put any pressure on it,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIt was a really serious injury in the calf and it\u2019s now much better. That\u2019s good for us and good for him but we don\u2019t know [when] exactly. The target was always after the next international break he could be ready but we don\u2019t know. Hopefully everything will be fine for the rest of the season. That is the plan.\u201d Summer signing Adri\u00e1n has deputised well in Alisson\u2019s absence with his penalty save from Tammy Abraham decisive in the Uefa Super Cup final defeat of Chelsea. Liverpool\u2019s demanding schedule could see them play twice a week until January, and Klopp has told Joe Gomez and others who have not featured regularly they will be invaluable over the coming months. Klopp, who expects Naby Ke\u00efta to return to training next week following a hip injury, added: \u201cI have said that to them already. They know it. The time coming up is the most intense period, right through until January. It is a slog, absolutely.\u201d The Liverpool manager, meanwhile, has claimed impatience was a major factor in Bobby Duncan\u2019s falling-out with the club and move to Fiorentina. Duncan was sold for \u00a31.8m this month after his agent, Saif Rubie, issued an extraordinary statement accusing Liverpool of mentally bullying the striker. But Klopp said: \u201cWe wanted to show him the perspective here but that is a message you deliver and if nobody gets the message then you cannot change that. Obviously he had a completely different idea and especially about the timescale of how quick it has to be. We had to accept that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
