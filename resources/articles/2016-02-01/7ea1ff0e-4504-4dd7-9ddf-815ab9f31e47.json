Late last year he was told by his hometown club Hull Kingston Rovers that he was not needed for 2016, a decision which left the 23-year-old fearing a step down into the Championship and a move away from Super League was his only option. Yet on Sunday Cox is preparing to take on the club he had been at since the age of 12 with Warrington, after a service station meeting with the Wolves coach, Tony Smith, gave his career the impetus it so desperately needed. \u201cIt\u2019s done me the world of good to get out of Hull, because I did get comfortable there,\u201d Cox admits. \u201cI had my feet under the table, but coming here has been an absolute revelation.\u201d With Cox\u2019s departure from the Robins only confirmed late into pre-season, the prop feared that most clubs would have no room for him. He even came close to working for Smith\u2019s brother, Brian. \u201cOn the first day of pre-season I was informed that [the Hull KR coach] Chris Chester didn\u2019t see me in his plans,\u201d Cox recalls. \u201cI rang my agent and said that I needed another club because they didn\u2019t want me there. He said that most of them were set for 2016 and I might have to drop down a division for a season. \u201cHowever, within two hours Brian Smith wanted to meet me and sign me for Wakefield, but while I was driving back from there, Tony wanted to meet up too. We met at a service station and as soon as I met him, I knew there was nowhere else I was going to sign. I rang Brian and said thanks for the interest, but Warrington was just too good to turn down.\u201d Now living on the other side of the country in Warrington \u2013 \u201cthat was frightening at first, because my mum did everything for me\u201d \u2013 Cox is aiming to show his former employers what they missed out on on Sunday by helping the Wolves to a second straight victory at the start of the new season. \u201cWhen I signed and saw the fixtures, I told Tony I\u2019d make the team for the Hull KR game,\u201d Cox says. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get belted and they\u2019ll come after me, but I\u2019ll just treat it as another game. I\u2019ve nothing against Hull KR \u2013 that\u2019s sport \u2013 but the timing has been impeccable for me. Leaving there has been a blessing in disguise for my career.\u201d Rob Burrow will captain Leeds Rhinos in the absence of their regular captain Danny McGuire as they face Widnes Vikings in their final match before Sunday\u2019s World Club Challenge against North Queensland. The hooker Beau Falloon, who missed last week\u2019s defeat to Warrington, is still sidelined with a foot injury. The final fixture features Castleford against Wakefield in a West Yorkshire derby, with the Tigers having to deal with the loss of their captain, Michael Shenton, who suffered a long-term knee injury during the draw at Hull KR last weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
