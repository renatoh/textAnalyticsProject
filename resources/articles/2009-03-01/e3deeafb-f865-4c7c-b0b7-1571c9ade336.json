Scott will end his six-year tenure at the head of the WTA in July to become Commissioner of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's C-10 Conference. \"With women's professional tennis more popular than ever, the Tour in the strongest business position in its history and a fantastic senior management team in place, now is the right time for me to embrace a new challenge consistent with my family and personal goals, and leave room for the next generation of Tour leadership to take on new responsibilities,\" he said. Scott's achievements during his time in charge include securing equal prize money with men for women at Roland Garros and Wimbledon and the signing of Sony Ericsson as sponsor of the WTA Tour for \u00a388m over six years, the largest sponsorship deal in the history of women's sport. He will work with the Tour board on the selection process for the next chairman and chief executive. Steve Simon, Tournament Board Representative and chairman of the Tournament Council, said: \"Under Larry's leadership, the Tour and our sport have grown over the past six years beyond anyone's wildest expectations. \"As an organisation and sport, we are positioned for continued success. We wish Larry the very best in his new role, and are looking forward to beginning the process of selecting a new CEO for the organisation to lead us into the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
