Mr Brown and Mr Darling are expected to talk to the management, unions and the regional development council about the situation facing the Merseyside plant, which makes the best-selling Astra. They are also expected to discuss how the government could help Ellesmere Port secure production of the successor to the Astra, to be introduced at the end of the decade. GM is expected to make a decision next year. GM has been looking at production of the Astra, which is made at a number of factories in Europe, and has indicated that it expected to cut the number of workers involved to boost overall productivity. Ellesmere Port has been seen as increasingly likely to bear the brunt of job cuts after the GM Europe president, Carl-Peter Forster, said last week that union suggestions that GM spread the cuts across other plants were not \"super-attractive\". Last night a GM spokesman said only that talks between the management and unions would continue but there was widespread speculation that the company would announce that it was to switch from three to two shifts at the plant, with the loss of about 1,000 jobs from a total workforce of just over 3,000. It is understood that workers will be called to mass meetings today to hear GM's decision on employment numbers. Union sources have declined to speculate on the contents of any announcement but have said the talks have \"not been encouraging\". If GM does announce heavy job cuts, unions will see the decision as another indication that employers are taking advantage of what they see as weak UK employment laws to cut numbers here, rather than elsewhere in the EU. They will point to PSA Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn's recent decision to shut its plant at Ryton in Coventry with the loss of 2,300 jobs; TVR's announcement that it is closing its plant in Blackpool, and Continental's decision earlier this week to make more than 400 workers redundant at its automotive components plant in Wales. Workers at Ellesmere Port have already staged a walk-out in protest at the prospect of job losses and one of the main unions, Amicus, has said it will end an \u00a38m car deal with Vauxhall and urge workers to boycott the company's products if it makes significant job cuts. Derek Simpson, Amicus general secretary, said: \"Britain has highly skilled workers and the most productive plants as well as the biggest market for motor vehicles. Yet UK workers are the first to be laid off because weak UK labour laws are being exploited by employers. Job protection similar to that enjoyed by workers in France would give British employees the opportunity to compete for investment.\" Last night a DTI spokeswoman said Mr Brown and Mr Darling would be \"looking to discuss what help we can give to help the plant succeed in getting the new Astra model built at Ellesmere Port.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
