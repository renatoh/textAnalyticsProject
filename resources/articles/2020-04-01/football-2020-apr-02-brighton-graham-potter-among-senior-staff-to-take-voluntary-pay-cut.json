Two unnamed first-team players are recovering at home after testing positive for Covid-19 and the rest are training in isolation in line with government advice. Potter said \u201cone or two\u201d were not sleeping well and were worried about events. Potter has joined the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, in taking a significant pay cut, and Brighton\u2019s technical director, Dan Ashworth, and chief executive, Paul Barber, have also volunteered a decrease in pay for the next three months, a gesture reluctantly accepted by the owner, Tony Bloom, who rejected the trio\u2019s request to take a reduction in wages a fortnight earlier. \u201cIt just felt like a normal thing to offer him because he has been good to me,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI know the pressure he is under as a chairman and the challenges he faces. It is a small part we can do but I think it was an important offer. Tony being Tony said: \u2018Thank you very much but, at the moment, we are working through things.\u2019 But as things have moved forward, I think we have come to the right decision to do what we have done.\u201d On Thursday Julian Knight, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, sent a letter to the Premier League expressing his \u201cstrong dismay\u201d at some clubs\u2019 decision to furlough non-playing staff while continuing to pay players; Newcastle, Norwich, Bournemouth and Tottenham are known to have done so. Potter said he could \u201cunderstand the criticism\u201d directed towards players but hoped they would do the right thing, as the game\u2019s stakeholders, including the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, prepare for further talks on Friday. \u201cWe want to try and do the right thing as a collective, as a humanity,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI am pretty sure football will come to those conclusions. It is up to them and the PFA to come to the right conclusions.\u201d Barber said Brighton were considering furloughing staff but hoped sacrificing wages would help protect hundreds of jobs, as well as around 2,500 people who indirectly rely on the club for employment. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our income literally disappear overnight but our costs have remained,\u201d Barber said. \u201cFurloughing is something which we have certainly looked at but our intention is to try to maintain employment for our club and charity for as long as we can and to ensure they receive their full wages for as long as we can. We can\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d He does not believe a blanket policy can be adopted by Premier League clubs given their different individual circumstances. On Thursday Norwich said their players, head coach Daniel Farke and executive committee would donate a percentage of their salaries, amounting to more than \u00a3200,000, to help people in Norfolk negatively affected by coronavirus. Potter and his coaching staff are in regular dialogue with Brighton\u2019s players, who are training as a team via videolink and have been given individual training programmes. Asked how they were coping in isolation, Potter said: \u201cI think, generally, well. But they\u2019re human beings. It\u2019s not comfortable. One or two are finding it difficult in terms of they\u2019re not sleeping so well and just trying not to worry too much about their own situation. \u201cThe unknown of what\u2019s going to happen is a challenge. They are human beings as well and some will deal with it better than others. And some will find it a challenge. We have to make sure we keep in contact with them and, generally, their attitude and their mentality has been really, really positive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
