Another European crisis. For almost half a century the EU has been pockmarked by one major political spat after another. But even by these standards, the unceremonious halt to last weekend's European summit discussions on a new EU constitution was both brutal and bad tempered. Whither now? This morning, Silvio Berlusconi gave a surreal account of the summit to the European parliament in Strasbourg, claiming with characteristic sun-tanned panache that behind the scenes a great deal had been achieved. No one believes him. The whiff of failure is far too strong. Berlusconi, Blair, Aznar, the Daily Telegraph, the Polish people, Gisela Stuart and many others beside are rushing to suggest that all is well. We didn't need the constitution in the first place, they claim, it was poorly designed, it would generate too many political headaches. Better to kick it into the long grass, whistle sweetly, and hope for the best. Poppycock. Everyone's a loser from this weekend's events. The notion that this is a \"good outcome\" - whether for No 10 or anyone else - is fanciful, other than in the most fleeting, short term sense of keeping the frothing British tabloids at bay for a little while longer. Here's a list of the most prominent losers: Jacques Chirac As so often, the French position at the summit was distinguished by a peculiarly fertile mix of humbug, arrogance and inconsistency. Lest anyone forget - since Chirac himself evidently has - it was Jacques who foisted the hopelessly complex and unworkable Nice voting formula onto the rest of Europe in the first place. This formula was the one which gave Poland and Spain a place at the high table, a position they inevitably now wish to defend to the hilt. That he decided to become the leading critic of his own Nice formula speaks volumes for Chirac's ability to believe two entirely contrasting propositions, and advocate them both with a straight face. Chirac, of course, has become such a partisan of a reformed voting formula because it both cements his new found alliance with Germany, and teaches those pesky newcomers from central and eastern Europe a little respect for the big founding members of the EU club. Yet, in the aftermath of the summit, Chirac finds himself under attack at home for putting personal vanity ahead of European integration, unnecessarily antagonising all of the EU's new members, and faced with growing questions in Germany about the wisdom of the Chirac-Schr\u00f6der love-in. While the Germans are undoubtedly becoming more assertive in the EU, they remain wary of becoming too closely allied to an increasingly capricious and volatile French administration. Chirac has upped the stakes by talking of the inevitability of a \"two-speed Europe\", egged on by the obsequious support of wee Belgium and Luxembourg. He may deliver on his threat. But he is unlikely to succeed in such a divisive strategy having already left such a trail of ill feeling throughout Europe behind him. Tony Blair The debate at prime minister's questions in the House of Commons on the outcome of the summit yesterday revealed the unrivalled short-termism of Blair's insipid brand of pro-Europeanism. He gave the false impression that much had been \"achieved\" at the summit, when in truth nothing has been agreed since nothing can be adopted until everything is agreed. He once again duped us all into thinking that some great battle had been won through the defence of Britain's \"red lines\", when almost none of the lines in question were ever under threat. He risibly praised Silvio Berlusconi, one of the greatest buffoons ever to have chaired an EU meeting, for his statesmanship. Blair's tactics on Europe, as always, were of evasion, half truths and obfuscation. With Gisela Stuart whittering on the sidelines about her inability to follow or influence the work of the convention (who's fault is that?), not to mention the increasingly condescending Euroscepticism of Messrs Brown and Straw, it is perhaps understandable that Blair should feel he's been let off the hook. But the reprieve, if any, is doomed to be short-lived. Either the constitution will re-emerge in the next year or so, in which case the disruption to European, local and national elections will be all the greater. Or Chirac will begin to deliver on his threat to surge forward regardless of Tony's misgivings, in which case Blair will go down in history as a self-professed pro-European who unwittingly aided and abetted a definitive split at the heart of Europe. Or EU decision making will simply grind to a gentle halt as the Nice treaty arrangements are found wanting and the tensions within an enlarged Europe prove unmanageable. This latter outcome, of course, is precisely what the anti-Europeans hope. A rich irony indeed: Blair's reticence on Europe may deliver precisely the outcome his greatest critics wish for. The Brussels Elite It is a little painful to watch the incomprehension on the faces of many of my friends and colleagues in the Brussels political goldfish bowl. For them, steadily advancing the onward march of European integration is an article of faith. The draft constitution, especially for those who served in Giscard d'Estaing's convention, was a definitive moment in the fulfilment of a great European dream. It seemed inconceivable to them that it could be so rudely trodden underfoot by the parochial political considerations of national governments. But the rough and tumble of politics has reasserted itself, big time. Quite right too. The gap between Brussels dreams and popular political consent has, once again, been found to be dangerously unbridgeable. We've been here before, countless times. French, Danish, Irish and Swedish referendums have all told us before that the foot soldiers of EU integration in Brussels are simply not speaking a language that voters either hear or understand. While much of the blame for last weekend's summit failure should fall upon those government leaders unable or unwilling to rise above their own national political constraints, responsibility must be borne by the EU idealists too. I so happen to share their fundamental belief that national sovereignty is too circumscribed to deal with many of the world's contemporary problems, and that a constitution which sets out how power is shared and deployed at supranational level is indispensable. But even I have long feared that the means by which that promise is delivered - especially the tattered credibility of the EU's own institutions - and the occasional tendency for the EU to become active in a bewildering array of public policy areas which do not always require supranational action, is draining the strength of the pro-European case. The architects of the constitution should not give up; a clear constitution is even more necessary than before this weekend. But simplicity and an unremitting focus on those objectives which can only be met through concerted European cooperation must now take precedence over all else. Public apprehension and anxiety, now the political leitmotif across most of Europe, must never be ignored in favour of a pan-European dream, however worthy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
