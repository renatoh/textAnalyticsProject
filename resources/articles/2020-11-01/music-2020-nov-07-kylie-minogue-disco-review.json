It started with Dua Lipa\u2019s album Future Nostalgia and its fusion of sleek dance-pop and disco decadence, before Lady Gaga took us off to the post-EDM clubs of Chromatica after a few years of dabbling with guitars, \u201cauthenticity\u201d and Mark Ronson. Following suit is Kylie \u2013 surname be damned! \u2013 who has eschewed the six-string instruments and stetsons of 2018\u2019s country-leaning Golden in favour of something much sparklier on her 15th album. Being bombarded with wall-to-wall bangers at a time when mainlining ITV\u2019s The Cube constitutes a big night is frustrating, but the efficiently titled Disco is saturated in Kylie\u2019s supernatural mix of high camp and total sincerity. Taking its cues from 1970s and 80s disco, all buffed staccato strings, lithe rhythm guitar and gold-plated choruses, the album works both as the soundtrack to an escapist glide around your kitchen or, on songs such as opener Magic and the timely lead single Say Something (\u201ccan we all be as one again?\u201d), a heartfelt wallow in heightened emotions. Mainly written and recorded during lockdown, with Minogue engineering her vocals from a makeshift home studio, it comes with its own anti-working-from-home anthem in the shape of the sashaying, conga-line ready Monday Blues. Of course on paper, \u201cKylie plus disco\u201d immediately conjures up images of lightly sloshed, wedding-reception-at-12am escapism, and luckily there\u2019s bucketloads of that here. The ludicrous, string-drenched Supernova, which ricochets like mirrorball reflections, initially feels like the apex but is trumped not once but twice; first by Where Does the DJ Go?, which pairs Chic-esque guitar lines with cheesy record scratches and a reference to I Will Survive, and then by the gloriously OTT Dance Floor Darling (a much better album title, let\u2019s be honest). After a mid-tempo start fuelled by finger snaps and glistening synths, this future crowd favourite \u2013 if such a thing can still exist \u2013 suddenly races through the gears. \u201cSo what you waiting for? Get up on the floor,\u201d Kylie coos as the tempo doubles amid a cluster of vocodered voices pleading \u201clet\u2019s get it on, until the break of dawn\u201d. It\u2019s as deliciously camp as the 80s blowout perm she sports on the album\u2019s artwork. While there\u2019s nothing here as instantly memorable as Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head or All the Lovers, Disco benefits from a consistent sonic palette, and one that nestles neatly inside the Kylie comfort zone. Free of the pressure of big singles in a streaming era that often sidelines \u201cheritage\u201d acts, the album also feels relatively filler-free. Even its weaker moments \u2013 the Strictly Come Dancing schmaltz of Miss a Thing, the grating Last Chance \u2013 are saved by a prevailing and unwavering belief in the healing power of pop. As with Golden, Kylie is listed as a co-writer on every track here, and while that album touched on some of her personal upheavals, Disco\u2019s lyrics mainly revolve around the push and pull of love and its myriad forms. It ends, however, with a curio in the shape of the piano-led self-empowerment anthem Celebrate You. Focusing on a single character, Mary (\u201cyou ain\u2019t ordinary\u201d), who represents the sadness in all of us, its trite conceit is exploded by a gorgeous, effervescent melody and a near-transcendent timeliness. It\u2019s the kind of magic trick only Kylie could pull off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
