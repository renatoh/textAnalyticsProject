But while staff rejected \u201cany ideological direction\u201d from the bosses and called the move \u201cpernicious ideological interference\u201d, management is not taking a back seat. Newly-appointed national editor James Chessell, who is still the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Europe editor based in London (and expounded on the snap UK election this week), contacted the chief foreign correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Paul McGeough, in Washington last week and told him his commentary on US president Donald Trump was \u201ctoo anti-Trump\u201d, according to some Fairfax sources. This view, aired regularly in the pages of News Corp\u2019s Australian newspaper, is said to be shared by Fairfax bosses Greg Hywood and Sean Aylmer. Other Fairfax insiders say McGeough, a former editor of the SMH and veteran frontline war correspondent from Baghdad to Afghanistan, has been told to change from non-stop commentary and analysis and become more of a conventional foreign correspondent. That means more news feature writing and even the odd non-Trump story. He, like other correspondents, has been urged to be careful with emotive language too; although he\u2019s been told he can still be critical of the president when necessary. Chessell said: \u201cWe think Paul is an excellent journalist and columnist, awarded over many years, and we are pleased he works at Fairfax.\u201d Lost leaders Journalists on the Victorian Leader community newspapers, owned by News Corp, don\u2019t have much sympathy for their more highly-paid colleagues on the metropolitan papers who may have to take on more duties when the sub-editors lose their jobs in the latest round of cost cutting. When we revealed last week that reporters at the Australian would soon need to \u201cwrite digital headlines, SEO headlines and standfirsts\u201d as well as write copy, the suburban journos scoffed that they had been doing that and more for years. In July last year News Corp closed seven of these local Victorian newspapers, including the Melbourne Leader, the Berwick Leader, the Brimbank Leader, the Free Press Leader, the Hobsons Bay Leader, the Melton Leader and the Wyndham Leader, leaving 26 mastheads. Now sources say editor-in-chief John Trevorrow has told staff that four of the 12 editors are to be made redundant and four vacant reporting roles are to be left unfilled. This means that the eight remaining editors will have to edit at least three titles each as well as maintaining the websites: all with just one reporter assigned to each paper. \u201cPeople are so demoralised, upset and undervalued,\u201d one staffer told Weekly Beast. \u201cThey like working in community newspapers and many have 25 years experience and are getting paid only $60,000.\u201d Unlike the Australian, the community newspapers still turn a profit, she said. Rake\u2019s progress? This weekend is a big one for Australian TV as the stars gather at Melbourne\u2019s Crown Entertainment Complex for the 59th TV Week Logie Awards, broadcast live on Nine at 7pm. This year five men and just one woman have been nominated for the top prize, the Gold Logie \u2013 actress Jessica Marais, who starred in Nine\u2019s Love Child and Ten\u2019s The Wrong Girl. Tellingly, the commercial TV dramas have been ignored in the peer-voted category Most Outstanding Drama Series this year with all the nominations going to the ABC or Foxtel: Cleverman (ABC), Rake (ABC), The Code (ABC), A Place To Call Home (Foxtel), Wentworth (Foxtel). This year\u2019s ceremony will also feature a stirring tribute to the late, great master of comedy John Clarke and the television pioneer Reg Grundy. With the beat tolls Freelance writer Corrine Barraclough had a cheeky line in her Daily Telegraph column this week about men who had been treated badly by the child support agency. \u201cCharmingly, sections of the media like to refer to them as \u2018deadbeat dads\u2019,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOf course, the alternative term for them is human beings.\u201d Was she referring to a column in another News Corp publication headlined \u201cTim Simona scandal: You\u2019re not the victims you\u2019re deadbeat dads\u201d we wondered? As it was written by Sunday Telegraph editor Mick Carroll, we hope for her sake she wasn\u2019t. Barraclough\u2019s conservative views have made her a favourite of former Labor leader Mark Latham, who is beavering away building his own media empire via a live Facebook video panel. He claims to have attracted more than 750,000 Facebook views in less than three weeks. Latham proudly tweeted this week that Barraclough was going to join his Facebook panel, which this week included ABC broadcaster Tom Switzer and Miranda Devine. Joined-up thinking A social media post from a Vietnamese student about being exploited and underpaid at a Melbourne restaurant was picked up by investigative reporters working at SBS Radio\u2019s Vietnamese service who uncovered crooked businesses who were paying just $6 an hour to unwitting staff. Showing its multi-platform ability, the multicultural broadcaster expanded the story so it would not be broadcast just on SBS Vietnamese Radio. The investigation also appears as an online multimedia feature and a news story on SBS TV news, both in English, and a podcast in Vietnamese. Using an undercover worker, investigative radio journalists Trinh Nguyen and Olivia Nguyen revealed that most of the restaurant owners refused to discuss wages with staff when they employed them, and no one was offered more than $10 in cash. Olivia Nguyen: \u201cIt is alarming to see increasing numbers of students facing such extreme situations in the Vietnamese community. What is more surprising is that fellow countrymen could exploit the vulnerability of these migrants.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
