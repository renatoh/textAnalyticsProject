Officers said they would take no further action on Friday evening. Earlier, Brand had apologised for the comments she made on Radio 4\u2019s Heresy show. She received some support, however, from fellow comedian David Baddiel, who attacked the BBC for editing the remarks out of a repeat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have nipped it out. Morally wrong? I\u2019m not sure. I think they\u2019re just trying not to cause trouble,\u201d he told BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme. Baddiel, who created Heresy, said: \u201cThe BBC are still, to some extent, the Auntie of the nation and they don\u2019t like trouble. Even though they did commission a show, Heresy, that was designed to push the boundaries of what people might think and say. \u201cIf it was up to me, I would have kept that line in for the repeat. Apart from anything, it\u2019s a bit silly when it\u2019s had massive coverage to cut it out \u2013 that looks a bit cowardly.\u201d Brand\u2019s joke on Tuesday was in response to a question about the \u201cterrible time\u201d politics was experiencing. She said: \u201cWell, yes, I would say that but that\u2019s because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore and they\u2019re very, very easy to hate and I\u2019m kind of thinking: \u2018Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u2019\u201d Immediately afterwards, Brand clarified her remarks, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I\u2019m not going to do it, it\u2019s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.\u201d Nigel Farage, who had milkshake thrown at him during campaigning for the European elections, demanded the police take action against Brand, accusing her of \u201cincitement of violence\u201d over the joke. But remain campaigner Femi Oluwole and others accused Farage of double standards, citing a comment he had made in a speech in 2017 saying he would be forced to \u201cpick up a rifle and head for the front lines\u201d if Brexit was not delivered. Far-right campaigner Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, also had milkshakes thrown at him during his unsuccessful bid to become an MEP. On Friday night, Scotland Yard said: \u201cPolice received an allegation of incitement to violence on 13 June, relating to comments made on a radio programme. \u201cThe referral has been considered by the Metropolitan police service and no further police action will be taken in relation to this allegation.\u201d It is understood the complaint to police did not come from Farage or from his Brexit party. Earlier on Friday, the Sun newspaper quoted Brand as saying the comment was probably \u201csomewhat a crass and ill-judged joke that might upset people\u201d. She added: \u201cOf course, I\u2019d never do anything like that. It was purely a fantasy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Brand also said she did not mention Farage by name and said female politicians and public figures have regularly faced \u201cfar worse\u201d threats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
