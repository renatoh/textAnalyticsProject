Allardyce reportedly said that \"it was a good meeting\" as he left and it is expected he will be unveiled as Glenn Roeder's successor as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. A four-year deal is rumoured, though no contract has been signed by the former Bolton Wanderers manager despite the presence of his representative Mark Curtis at Claridges yesterday. Newcastle's delegation included Shepherd's increasingly influential son Kenneth. \"Sam is the nearest thing to a replica of Joe Harvey I have seen. He has the same rugged determination and enthusiasm as Joe,\" Shepherd reportedly said, referring to the man who won the Fairs Cup for the club in 1969. Although there remains a doubt over Allardyce's preferred backroom staff at St James' Park - and it is something of a sticking point - this was a remarkably public venue for a meeting that might have been expected to be clandestine. Its public nature suggests Allardyce and Newcastle may have been given permission by Bolton to negotiate. Bolton are this week believed to have offered a new role and a new contract to Mike Forde in order to deter one of Allardyce's important right-hand men at Bolton from joining him on Tyneside. Time will tell if other figures significant to Allardyce at Bolton move further north. Presumably one of the topics discussed at yesterday's three-hour meeting in a partitioned-off area of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at the hotel was Michael Owen's position and Shepherd's attitude towards the England striker. Allardyce is thought to be enthusiastic about keeping Owen, so the release yesterday morning of a video clip on the YouTube internet site of Shepherd caught on a Liverpool fan's camera declaring to Liverpool fans stalking him that he would \"carry Michael Owen back [to Liverpool] for \u00a39m\" was not ideal. At first Shepherd's tone sounds serious. But he relents instantly, referring to Owen as \"a good lad,\" and \"a decent lad\", and then mutters in uncomplimentary fashion about the striker's agent. Given Shepherd's warning on Wednesday to Owen about \"loyalty\" to the club and the clear tension that exists between Newcastle and Owen's camp, the video clip might have been seen as incendiary. But Shepherd was relaxed about its public release and believes it shows no more than banter. Newcastle issued a statement to that effect yesterday afternoon which said: \"Anyone who has seen this video clip will immediately regard it for exactly what it is. It's nothing more than tongue-in-cheek banter in the most light-hearted fashion that nobody could take remotely seriously or try to misinterpret. The chairman shows just how approachable he is by having a laugh with a couple of football fans, and Geordies and Liverpool supporters are world-renowned for enjoying a joke and sharing a sense of humour, after all.\" Owen's, and his agent's, response is unknown, but if Owen is peeved then this might put some more distance between the two parties. Newcastle's caretaker manager, Nigel Pearson, said Owen displayed no signs of anger yesterday. Newcastle finish their season at Watford tomorrow and Pearson said there was \"no suggestion\" the issue would complicate his team selection. \"He's available,\" Pearson said. \"Michael is fine.\" Newcastle did confirm two further injury problems yesterday. Their captain Scott Parker is to undergo a hernia operation, which many will believe means he has played his last game for the club, and Damien Duff has had an operation on his foot which will keep him out possibly beyond the start of next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
