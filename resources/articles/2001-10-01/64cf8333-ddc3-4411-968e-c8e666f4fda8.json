If not, the winking redhead was robbed. Her autobiography underlines what we already suspected - that here is a grandiose, superior, rapier-witted, ruthlessly ambitious media Caligula, for whom subservience and self-deprecation are arsenic at the banquet table. The question is: what made her this way? How are the Anne Robinsons of this world formed? Well, maybe it could be viewed as significant that Robinson's memoirs begin with her own mother's advice about marriage: 'Have a facial once a month and get plenty of help around the house.' Robinson goes on to describe her mother as 'part magic, part monster', adding, rather mischievously: 'I have felt comfortable in the company of bullies, monsters and madness ever since.' The message is clear. Just as there is not just one 'Anne Robinson' in this book but several, all vying simultaneously for our sympathy and vilification, there is not just one 'unfit' mother featured in this book but two. The young Robinson herself - the 'roaring drunk' so out of control she loses custody of her daughter, Emma, to her ex-husband, the former Times editor Charles Wilson, in a court battle that hinged upon her famously stated preference for covering the Vietnam war, rather than vacuuming the sitting-room. Then there is Robinson's own mother, a street trader who was 'Aunt Mame crossed with Howard Hughes out of Vogue and Mother Teresa'. Sound familiar? It should do, because this is no ordinary memoir, rather a re-tread of Mommie Dearest. Only this time, it's 'unintentional abuse', and, like a heavy date with colonic irrigation, there's just as much of it going out as there is coming in. The book isn't just a memoir about motherhood. Throughout, Robinson is disarmingly frank about her rise and fall and rise, her personal and professional shortcomings (greed, oneupmanship, ambition), even more so her triumphs (this woman could self-aggrandise for Britain); precise and hilarious on sociological detail (not least the sexist, boozy world of journalism) and fearlessly scathing about those, like Germaine Greer, who did not come up to her own 'exacting standards'. Rather naughtily, Robinson is also scathing about those who once did. Something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the disgraced Mirror boss, Robert Maxwell, the golden girl now declares that she always had his number: 'I always took it for granted that Maxwell's word was only as long as the day,' she says, writing, one suspects, with her pants on fire. Robinson is similarly unforgivable when describing her second husband, now manager, John Penrose: 'Girl friends observed with some envy that Penrose came just as soon as I whistled, however badly I behaved,' she smirks. Oh dear. Why Mr Penrose allowed that viciously emasculating sentence to go through is anyone's guess; you can almost hear his balls rattling around in Robinson's Gucci handbag. Even stranger, as her career starts to recover and set her on the road to being a household name, Robinson starts to draw unnerving and frankly preposterous parallels between herself, Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. 'In our different ways, the three of us would change dramatically over the next decades,' she opines. Phew! Pretentious toi? However, these are the few false notes in an account that is sometimes too candid to bear. You can only wonder why, having won international fame with the dominatrix game show, The Weakest Link, Robinson has decided to cook herself beneath such an unflattering spotlight. Here she is on her alcoholism: 'At its worst, it meant ending up with my knickers around my head in a bed I didn't recognise, surrounded by vomit and having not the faintest idea where I was.' Modern girls might scoff: that isn't a 'low', Anne, that's Saturday night. However, Robinson was a woman out of time. Born into Scouse 'new' money, she passed through boarding school and finishing school, to wind up door-stepping for newspapers in a mink coat bought by Mater. Her marriage to Wilson was a disaster, because she was no conventional wife. Then came the depression, the career skid, the alcoholism. 'I now believe that I was born with a capacity for excess circling my veins,' she writes. It was to cost her dear. It was to cost her her daughter. When Robinson lost custody of Emma, she found herself confined to the parental fringes, a cold, scary world of weekend access, separation anxiety (a 'living bereavement') and guilt-ridden, long, dark nights of the soul. Robinson readily admits that Wilson was probably acting for the best (no 'probably' about it, seeing as Robinson was, by then, a total dipsomaniac). Still, though, her prose seethes, from beginning to end, with mint-fresh suffering and perceived injustice, which is lightened only by her obvious devotion to her daughter. 'She is proof that hope and spirit can triumph over the most unpromising of beginnings.' Here is proof that it's possible for a woman to write a dual love letter to her mother and daughter, not to mention motherhood itself, in all its 'unfit' shape and forms, which is also a cracking, unsentimental good read. Skimming it is impossible, like hurrying past the crown jewels when you've been queuing for hours to see them. Indeed, love her or loathe her, Robinson has produced a book that revolutionises the celebrity autobiography.
