This is irrefutable \u2013 372 games, two Brownlow medals, two premierships and a four-time All-Australian. Adam Goodes is a proud Indigenous Australian. This too, is irrefutable \u2013 and it was all we could do to humiliate and howl him into retirement. Sport, at its very best, remains one of the most powerful drivers for progressive change in this country. It is one of the few areas in Australian life where from time to time we have paused to consider our prejudices. Sadly, during the period covered in The Final Quarter \u2013 a film on the final three years of Goodes\u2019 playing career when he became a lightning rod for frenzied public debate \u2013 the silence required for self-reflection was hard to find amid the booing and media pile-on. The documentary is another reminder that even a game that has just celebrated its Indigenous round still grapples with matters around race, with history, and a whole gamut of things we find difficult to talk about. The documentary\u2019s director, Ian Darling, says he hoped people would engage with the film and that it would show we are all capable of self-reflection. \u201cThe feedback I\u2019ve had from those close to the game, including players and coaches, is that they never really understood the extent of what Adam had to deal with,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s taken us all by surprise and of course the person who felt every bit of it was Adam.\u201d Darling says it is easy to rewrite history and even easier to rewrite modern history where often only the loudest voices cut through. The documentary demonstrates that even in the face of intolerable abuse, Goodes always maintained his dignity and grace. \u201cWhen all this was happening, I was angry, upset and confused. And before I knew it Adam had left the game and the commentary had moved on to the next thing, when for many the issue never left us,\u201d says Darling. \u201cI never fully appreciated how much Adam spoke in the middle of all this. Week in, week out Adam was out there talking about Indigenous issues. The problem wasn\u2019t what Adam said, but that we didn\u2019t listen. I hope this is a second chance for us to listen.\u201d The Final Quarter is an uncomfortable reminder that in calling out racism and calling on his own cultural heritage and Aboriginal self in a proud and powerful way, Goodes became a target of those who believed the price of admission included the shallow, self-entertainment of mob bigotry. Rather than being viewed as part of the Winmar-Long cultural continuum, moments such as Goodes\u2019 \u201cwar dance\u201d turned lazy rightwing shock jocks into pant-pissing pundits who found the imaginary spear-throwing to be offensively violent. But occasionally the light shines through a dishwater sky, where only those with the hardest of hearts would not swallow hard. Such a moment is the show of support for an absent Goodes at the SCG in August 2015, when Sydney fans stood and cheered at the seven-minute mark of the third quarter, acknowledging Goodes\u2019 guernsey number of 37. \u201cI thought, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to finish the film here,\u201d says Darling. \u201cBut the next week, here we go again with the booing \u2013 it was a moment, not a movement.\u201d Prior to the SCG game, Swans chairman Andrew Pridham said: \u201cI believe that the events of the last week [that led to Goodes stepping out of the game] are a seminal moment in our history \u2013 perhaps it was a moment that our nation needed to have.\u201d It echoed the words of Stan Grant \u2013 who is also releasing a film about Goodes \u2013 that are included in the documentary and bear repeating. \u201cThere is a moment here where we can have a real conversation about how Indigenous people feel. About what Adam hears when he hears those boos. That\u2019s the conversation we can have.\u201d We blew it. The Final Quarter opens with the bluff machismo of a former footballer whose commitment to his role comes across as a physical undertaking rather than an intellectual or emotional one. It is repeated towards the end of the documentary \u2013 a symbol that for everything that happened, nothing much has changed. Many within the AFL who have seen the documentary have acknowledged they should have done more to speak out against the booing that drove a proud man into retirement the year after he was awarded Australian of the Year. This is a start. Adam Goodes is one of the greatest footballers of our generation. But his greatness will not be viewed in the context of his on-field achievement, rather through the lens of his broader humanity. The game is fortunate to have had a man of Goodes\u2019 stature represent it \u2013 and given the events this documentary reminds us of, undeservingly so. Darling\u2019s film holds a mirror to one of the most shameful moments of our game\u2019s history (and reminds us that there are many in Australian public life whose egos are too large to accept the reflection), but it also gives us another chance for self-examination, which is all that Goodes asked of us. Here\u2019s hoping that for the game, for our country, that The Final Quarter represents a movement and not a moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
