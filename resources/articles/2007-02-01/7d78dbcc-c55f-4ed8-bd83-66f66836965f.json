But a heroin overdose and a spell in rehab suggest it has not been easy growling songs about hating everyone while wearing a leotard. His audience has remained loyal and, with Nine Inch Nails's new album, Year Zero, due in April, it is being replenished with a new generation of black-clad teenies. The band's entrance - singing Mr Self Destruct under a nuclear-powered lightshow - is as disorientating as rock gets in 2007. They sound like the heaviest heavy metal band, the glamist glam band and the most electronic electro-disco band all at once. It's like hearing a gigantic industrial processor spew out 30 years of pop. Reznor retains an edge that is rare in music, working himself up to such an intensity that it is no wonder Nine Inch Nails tour infrequently. A slight dip in atmosphere for unfamiliar new songs allows a rare glimpse of Reznor humour: \"I heard Manchester was violent,\" he quips, provocatively. \"That must have been the old days.\" However, hushed reverence greets Hurt, as covered by Johnny Cash, with Reznor pouring out his woes at a piano. Things finally spill towards chaos during a brutal Head Like a Hole, which sees Reznor hurling his guitar high into the air and turning his back as it crashes to the stage. \u00b7 At Glasgow Academy tonight and tomorrow. Box office: 0870 7712000. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
