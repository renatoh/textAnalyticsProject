The touring party arrived in Northampton on Tuesday, preparing for a first-class fixture that starts on Friday. But Haddin, 37, who was not expected to be recalled for next week\u2019s fifth Test at The Kia Oval, had left London hours earlier. A Cricket Australia spokesperson confirmed his departure, asking the media to respect the wicketkeeper and his family\u2019s privacy. Haddin missed the second Test to spend time with his daughter in a London hospital. Peter Nevill made an impressive Test debut at Lord\u2019s in Haddin\u2019s absence. And given Haddin\u2019s indifferent form with the bat over the past year or so, the selectors opted to retain Nevill for the third and fourth Tests. Darren Lehmann, the Australia coach, called it the toughest cricket decision he had had to make. Some former players, including Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne and Matthew Hayden, were highly critical of the decision. Haddin remained with the 17-man squad for both games, having playing the tour match against Derbyshire last month, and the consummate team man continued to work closely with Nevill, the 29-year-old he has mentored since the two became club and state team-mates with New South Wales in 2008. Haddin is yet to announce his retirement after 66 Tests, but his card has effectively been marked given Nevill\u2019s promotion and age. \u201cWe certainly care about Brad and his family,\u201d Lehmann said after the third Test. \u201cWe\u2019re really close as a group. We\u2019ve talked about it openly. That would be the hardest decision I\u2019ve had to make as a coach, or even as a player. \u201cWe all love Hadds. The players love Hadds. He\u2019s a ripper bloke - one of the best blokes I\u2019ve ever coached, brilliant person, great family.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Haddin will continue to play for NSW and the Sydney Sixers. He is expected to make a quick transition into coaching when he does retire, a move England coach Trevor Bayliss would support. \u201cHe would make a good coach,\u201d Bayliss said of former charge Haddin before the Ashes. \u201cHe\u2019s got the respect of the players. And just his rapport with the players - it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the older players or the younger players, they all gravitate to Hadds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
