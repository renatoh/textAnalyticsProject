It has also emerged that the international scout, Ian Broomfield, has left the club. Mitchell is not expected to serve the full term, which would take him up to the end of 2017, but it looks likely he will remain in situ for the January transfer window and, possibly, be asked to work towards next summer. Tottenham are sifting through potential successors and they have put Pochettino at the heart of the process. The club took Mitchell from Southampton in November 2014 on Pochettino\u2019s say-so \u2013 the pair had worked well together at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 and it is clear the new man will also have to buy into the manager\u2019s philosophy. The process, though, has not been straight-forward because there are not many high\u2011calibre candidates and, of these, many have lengthy notice clauses. Mitchell resigned on the eve of the season because he was frustrated with the constraints of his role. It was suggested at the time he struggled to work with the chairman, Daniel Levy, the notoriously hard-line negotiator, who has a hands-on role in player recruitment. Mitchell\u2019s notice period has prevented him from making a move into management. MK Dons \u2013 a club for whom he once played \u2013 had wanted to speak to him after they parted company with Karl Robinson in October but they could not afford to buy out his contract at Spurs. The Tottenham hierarchy are happy Mitchell\u2019s notice period offers them protection as they do not want to be left without anybody in his position. The assumption is that once they have agreed a deal with his replacement they will negotiate his release. In the interim, they find themselves in the curious position of having an employee in a key role, who no longer wants to be there. T hey have been left to rely upon Mitchell\u2019s professionalism. Pochettino, though, has no worries about a man he continues to count as a friend. \u201cIt will not affect us,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe is working because, when he presented his resignation, it was 16 months\u2019 notice. He\u2019s doing the same job, because Tottenham pay his salary. It\u2019s difficult to find a replacement and difficult to move quickly. It\u2019s always to protect our club and our interests. It\u2019s not [only] his decision to sign [players], it\u2019s Tottenham\u2019s. But with him, without him or with another person I think it\u2019s always difficult to sign players in January.\u201d Broomfield, who was in his second spell at the club, departed last week after his contract expired and, to his surprise, he was not given a new one. Levy continues to have Dave Webb as the head of elite potential identification and Stuart Metcalf as the head of performance analysis \u2013 both of whom report to Mitchell. The club\u2019s recruitment drive from last summer, when \u00a370m was spent on Victor Wanyama, Vincent Janssen, Moussa Sissoko and Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou, has come in for scrutiny with the latter three still to convince. Nkoudou, a winger, who joined from Marseille, has not started a Premier League game. Pochettino sounded a lot like many of his managerial predecessors at White Hart Lane when he lamented how, \u201cif we compare Tottenham to Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United, it is difficult to compete with them\u201d. He talked about the need to be \u201cimaginative and creative\u201d in the transfer market because \u2013 with the building of the new stadium draining resources \u2013 Spurs did not have the same financial clout as their rivals. \u201cYou need, sometimes, to take risks,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\u201d He was asked whether he felt he had won with Nkoudou: \u201cWe will see. We cannot be unfair with him because it\u2019s difficult to assess him today \u2013 to say he failed. We need to give him more time. Now, he is settled and he needs to build his confidence and start to show his real quality.\u201d Preparations for the home game against Hull City on Wednesday night have been undermined by a foot injury to Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. \u00c9rik Lamela (hip) and Janssen (ankle) remain out \u2013 most likely until the new year. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 took a kick to the top of his foot at Manchester United on Sunday and, yet again, the rhythm of his season has been upset. Pochettino suggested he could come back for Sunday\u2019s home match against Burnley. \u201cIt is the same foot, as always,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt has been two or three years with problems \u2013 it is not a new problem. He feels bad about the situation because he plays one game and feels some problem. He is not free like he was last season to play, play, play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
