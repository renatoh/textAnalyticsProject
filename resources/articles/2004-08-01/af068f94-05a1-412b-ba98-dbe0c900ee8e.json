It was spelt correctly in the text and has been amended on the website. The headline on an article about students graduating in 2003, A third of class of 2003 are unemployed, page 7, yesterday, gave a false impression of the situation. As the article itself made clear, this is the proportion not in full-time employment. Most of the remainder are studying full- or part-time and the proportion unemployed, as normally defined, is just over 7%. Germany's largest newspaper publisher is Axel Springer (not Alex), What they say about spelling reform in Germany, page 22, August 10. In True blue and ... who?, Shortcuts, page 4, G2, August 10, we described Wolff Olins as \"the consultancy responsible for rebranding ... O2.\" In fact, Lambie-Nairn was the agency responsible for the invention of the O2 brand. Wolff Olins had nothing to do with O2. In a media business story, Scotsman rewinds clock by turning tabloid, page 16, August 10, we said the Scotsman was first published in 1831. In fact the Scotsman was founded as a tabloid or compact in 1817. It became a broadsheet in 1831. The annual conference in Chicago of the Congress for the New Urbanism was the 12th such event not the 10th (Riba goes to town etc, page 9, July 31). In Pick of the day, page 24, G2, August 10, we referred to the Queen as HRH. It is HM [Her Majesty] the Queen. In our obituary of Father Michael Prior, page 29, August 6, we referred to the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzel. We should have said Herzl. It was Michael Curtiz not Tod Browning who directed Doctor X (1932) (Fay Wray obituary, page 27, yesterday). \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
