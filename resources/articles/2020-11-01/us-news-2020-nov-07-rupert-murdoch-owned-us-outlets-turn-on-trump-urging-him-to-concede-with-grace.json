The new messaging appears to be closely coordinated, and it includes an appeal to Trump to preserve his \u201clegacy\u201d by showing grace in defeat. The message is being carried on Fox News and in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post \u2013 all outlets avidly consumed by Trump himself, especially Fox. One Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, an intimate of the president ever since she spoke at the 2016 Republican national convention, made an astounding statement that seemed directed at Trump personally, advising him to accept defeat \u201cif and when that does happen\u201d with \u201cgrace and composure\u201d and appealing to his sense of his own legacy. Ingraham said in part: \u201cIf and when it\u2019s time to accept an unfavourable outcome in this election, and we hope it never comes, but if and when that does happen, president Trump needs to do it with the same grace and composure he demonstrated at that town hall with Savannah Guthrie. So many people remarked about his tone and presence. Exactly what he needs. \u201cNow losing, especially when you believe the process wasn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s a gut punch. And I\u2019m not conceding anything tonight, by the way. But losing, if that\u2019s what happens \u2013 it\u2019s awful. But president Trump\u2019s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward.\u201d The Wall Street Journal has published an opinion piece with almost the exact same message. It is titled \u201cThe Presidential Endgame\u201d and subtitled \u201cTrump has the right to fight in court, but he needs evidence to prove voter fraud\u201d. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,\u201d the piece warns. Here is how the article opened: \u201cPerhaps it was inevitable that Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign would end as his presidency began: with the president claiming victory and his frenzied antagonists denouncing him as a would-be fascist. The reality is that the US can and probably will have a normal election outcome regardless of the shouting between now and then. \u201cMr Biden is leading in enough states to win the presidency, and if those votes survive recounts and legal challenges, he will be the next president.\u201d The New York Post \u2013 which before the election was the launch vehicle for wild and desperate attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u2013 has produced a front page that all but proclaims a Biden victory: Top editors at the Post have \u201ctold some staff members this week to be tougher in their coverage\u201d of Trump, the New York Times reported, citing two anonymous employees of the paper. The Times piece said: \u201cOn Thursday, in a sudden about-face, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s scrappy tabloid published two articles with a wildly different tone. One accused the president of making an \u2018unfounded claim that political foes were trying to steal the election\u2019. The headline on the other described Donald Trump Jr as the \u2018panic-stricken\u2019 author of a \u2018clueless tweet\u2019.\u201d News coverage at Fox News has similarly shown little patience with the lies about voter fraud Trump is advancing in hopes of reversing the election. Asked about the Trump campaign\u2019s assertion that Republican observers had not been allowed to observe vote-counting, the Fox correspondent states flatly: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just not true.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
