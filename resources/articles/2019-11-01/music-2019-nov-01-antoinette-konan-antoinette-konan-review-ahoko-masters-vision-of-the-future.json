Their punctuating fills serve as a constant reminder of the era\u2019s kitsch futurism and one setting in which they find their ideal expression is in the work of Ivory Coast singer and percussionist Antoinette Konan. Konan\u2019s eponymous 1986 international debut is a kaleidoscopic jumble of drums \u2013 the electric, the acoustic and, crucially, the ahoko. A ribbed wooden stick with a hollowed-out shell to rub along it, the minimalist instrument is a staple of the indigenous Baoul\u00e9 people of the Ivory Coast and its playing is an integral feature of Konan\u2019s album, now reissued. Konan\u2019s record may be rooted in the 80s but it is thoroughly modern, transplanting the traditional carnivalesque devotional songs of the Baoul\u00e9 to an emerging sacred space of the era: the dancefloor. In mixing the \u201cwestern\u201d electronic sounds of drum samplers, synthesisers and twanging bass with Baoul\u00e9 vocals and the ever-present thrumming of the ahoko, Konan\u2019s record made her music a crate-digger\u2019s must-have for the club. Among the current glut of reissues, this re-pressing sounds remarkably fresh. While downbeat numbers such as Enfants Du Monde and Evignen are dragged down by their somewhat syrupy sweetness, the short and sharp kinetic tracks are irresistible. Opener Kokoloko Tani buzzes in with those inimitable toms and a selection of Baoul\u00e9 tuned bells set to Konan\u2019s tenor, while Abidjan Adja and M\u2019ack\u00f4 are polyrhythmic gems of mid-tempo movement, a new jack swing of Africa\u2019s west coast. Konan produced the entire record and her singular vision shows on its speedy 25-minute runtime. It is a near-perfect combination of tradition and modernism to create an imagining of a future sound, one which can only ever have existed in Konan\u2019s hands some 33 years ago. Also out this month The reissue of the 1991 debut of all-female a capella group Zap Mama, Adventures In Afropea, serves as a heart-rending reminder of the history of European blackness amid our current removal from the continent. Comprised of Congolese pop, gospel and medieval chanting, Zap Mama\u2019s sound is an enveloping and deeply soulful testament to cultural exchange. Yemeni band El Khat deconstruct traditional folk songs into a gritty, guitar-fuelled collection of incisive statements on Saadia Jefferson, with highlights including the band\u2019s use of junk instruments to provide a clattering foundation to tracks Atabina and Ya Raiyat. Ghanaian gospel singer Alogte Oho also releases his debut international album Mam Yinne Wa, a remarkable mix of dubby reggae, the choral music of his Frafra people and horn-laden funk \u2013 a sun-drenched, joyous listen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
