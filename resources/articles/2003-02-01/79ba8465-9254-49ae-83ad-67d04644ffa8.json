During the sexual offences bill's second reading in the Lords, Home Office minister Lord Falconer claimed that there had been \"some confusion about our proposed offence of sexual activity in public\". \"We will therefore be looking at the drafting of this offence again, during the bill's committee stage, to make sure we get it completely right,\" he promised. The Lords has traditionally been more socially conservative than the Commons, having repeatedly rejected attempted to repeal Section 28, which bans the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools. Lord Falconer's comments will be seen as an attempt to defuse the peers' opposition to the bill. Championing the bill, Lord Falconer said it would \"drag the law on sexual offences into the 21st century, in a way which will treat everyone in society equally\". \"The bill provides for new offences that set out clearly what is unacceptable sexual behaviour, together with appropriate penalties,\" he declared. \"We have sought to strike a balance between providing greater protection for victims, and also ensuring fairness for defendants.\" But the opposition benches were not convinced of the merits of decriminalising sexual encounters in public toilets, providing the participants closed the cubicle door. The Conservatives' Lady Noakes said: \"Ordinary people are outraged by hearing such sexual activities in public lavatories. Parents do not believe that their children should be exposed to this.\" The Tories' deputy leader in the Lords, Lady Blatch, welcomed the new offence prohibiting sex in public places, which she said was \"much stronger\" than the existing offence of outraging public decency. However, she still expressed concern about the repeal of the existing law of gross indecency. \"Public lavatories are no place for sexual activity,\" she said, \"whether homosexual or heterosexual\". \"What mother would want to send her young children to such a lavatory if she knew sexual activity could be taking place there?\" She concluded: \"the bill will make public lavatories no-go areas for families.\" Openly gay Labour peer Lord Alli said the reforms to the law dealing with male homosexual activity were overdue. He said it was \"incredible\" that the laws under which Oscar Wilde had been prosecuted for homosexual activity 100 years ago were still on the statute book, and argued that the bill would rectify this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
