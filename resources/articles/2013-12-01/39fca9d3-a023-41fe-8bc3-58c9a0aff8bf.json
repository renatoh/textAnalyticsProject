It remains to be seen", "bodyText": "There are proposals to sell Medibank Private coming from various blithe quarters \u2013 namely the government, the IPA, and even unionist Paul Howes. Unfortunately, little thought has been given to what whether it would create any public good, or if there is popular approval. The last time the Coalition proposed to privatise Medibank Private was in 2006. After the Howard government won control of both houses of parliament, Australia learnt of Howard\u2019s intention to privatise the corporation \u2013 in the same way we learnt of the Coalition\u2019s intention to enforce Work Choices six weeks after the election; there was no disclosure before the 2004 election. The Medibank Private Sale Authorisation Act was passed swiftly in 2006. Howard assured Australia it would only be used if the government was to be given a mandate at the 2007 election. It never received one. Set up in 1976 by the Fraser Liberal government as a not-for-profit corporation, Medibank Private provided cheap private health insurance to Australians. For decades, it provided affordable health insurance at cost price without private insurance providers extracting overzealous profit from Australians. It also had the advantage of forcing its private competitors to reduce its prices. Its function was altered when in 2009 Kevin Rudd made Medibank Private for profit, allowing the government to extract a dividend from the corporation. This ended the cheap not-for-profit health insurance and the public good that went with that. Rudd effectively created a working asset for government which contributed to government revenues - this allowed the reduction of taxation while maintaining the same level of government services. Medibank is a government investment which pays dividends, so the Australian people pay fewer taxes. Such public policy was a part of a suite of policies which allowed the Rudd/Gillard government to tax significantly less than the Howard government. It remains to be seen what collective advantage would be made for the sale of Medibank Private. After all, once it is sold, it is gone. As a matter of public policy, the cult of privatisation, according to Tony Judt, has produced \u201cno discernible collective advantage.\u201d The sale would see a dividend to the government disappear; a dividend which at a later stage will require recouping through greater taxation or a reduction of government services. Anyone concerned about wealth inequality cannot support a sale. Medibank Private is one of the few bits of capital that is collectively owned, reducing the tax burden on Australian workers. Moreover, following decades of labour\u2019s share of income declining relative to capital, selling Medibank Private would give further income to capital increasing wealth inequalities in Australia. A sale of Medibank Private would give more money to capital further entrenching wealth inequality; I have little faith that this isn\u2019t a goal of the present government. What about Medibank's opponents? It is skullduggerous to suggest, as they do, that because a company is owned by the state it therefore is intrinsically inefficient. It is not about who owns it, but how it is run. It is run for profit \u2013 so the profit motive exists. Those who want to see Medibank Private enter private hands would need to justify why Australia should forgo those dividends, and why the state ought not participate as a capitalist too. They must justify why, when those dividends are gone, a raise of taxes is good public policy. Only 22% of Australians want to see Medibank Private given to over private hands. Furthermore, there is little support for the sale of Medibank Private among Coalition supporters too (32%). The privatisation of Medibank Private would be highly unpopular, especially without permission from voters. It's worth remembering the details of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia\u2019s sale for $7.8bn (now valued at $122bn) and its recent $5.8bn dividend for 2013 they are understandably livid towards the insanity of the cult of privatisation. However when sold it was valued $11.2bn, meaning there was a $3.4bn subsidy - a transfer of wealth from the collective to the new owners - equivalent to the entire GDP of Fiji. This can hardly be construed as an efficient use of public resources. CBA was sold on the cheap, and Australians did not benefit. Now its owners enjoy what was our collective wealth. We should learn from that mistake. Neither the government nor the opposition have a mandate to sell our Medibank Private. Both should think carefully if it they wish to do so without voters' approval. As it stands, it is not theirs to sell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
