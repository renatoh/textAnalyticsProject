The popular, much-hyped chestnut was travelling strongly and seemed able to go past Fakir D\u2019Oudairies at any moment but instead left that rival to score an easy victory at Fairythouse. \u201cStrap yourselves in,\u201d called the track commentator, Jerry Hannon, anticipating a big finish as the two horses turned for home. But Fakir D\u2019Oudairies threw in a leap that Samcro could not match; he hit the top of the fence and sprawled on the landing side, leaving Kennedy no chance of staying aboard and echoing his late fall in Punchestown\u2019s Champion Hurdle last year. The jockey punched the turf in frustration. But the positive message to be taken from the race is that Samcro\u2019s engine evidently remains intact. He was reportedly uninjured. \u201cWhat would have happened, I\u2019m not totally sure but Jack couldn\u2019t have been happier,\u201d said Samcro\u2019s trainer, Gordon Elliott. \u201cHe showed a lot of spark and he looks to be back to his best.\u201d Arguably, Elliott\u2019s most exciting charge just now is Envoi Allen, a stylish winner of the Royal Bond, which took place half an hour before Samcro\u2019s spill. The Grade One novice hurdle has a good reputation for identifying major talents, like Moscow Flyer, Hurricane Fly and Jezki. The other Grade One on the Fairyhouse card, the Hatton\u2019s Grace, was won impressively by Honeysuckle under Rachael Blackmore, with Apple\u2019s Jade disappointing in third. Honeysuckle is 2-1 favourite for the mares\u2019 hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival but is no bigger than 14-1 for the Champion Hurdle. Meanwhile, Nicky Henderson said Buveur D\u2019Air was beginning what is expected to be a slow recovery from the hoof injury he sustained at Newcastle on Saturday, when a piece of wood from a hurdle stuck into a hoof. An operation will be necessary and his season could be over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
