The West Ham manager said he would be surprised if the 26-year-old sued the Manchester City player or his employers at the time of the incident, Chelsea. The tackle, which broke Ashton's ankle, occurred at Manchester United's Carrington training ground before England's friendly against Greece in August 2006. \"I don't know about [Ashton suing Wright-Phillips],\" said Zola. \"It comes very much as a surprise to me. I don't know if it's what he wants to do. It seems strange he might want to do something like that but we'll see what happens.\" Ashton's agent, Darren Bosson, refused to comment but sources close to Ashton said he was seriously considering legal action. Zola's comments came after Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said he hoped that Ashton would not sue. \"I hope it doesn't come to that because nobody would think that Shaun Wright-Phillips was a malicious player at all,\" said Taylor. \"At the moment we've been speaking to his [Ashton's] representatives and the situation is about looking to get proper compensation without discussing any player-v-player action.\" Ashton made 31 league appearances for West Ham after the injury but degenerative damage led the Dutch surgeon who carried out the first operation, Niek van Dyke, to recommend retirement, lest Ashton lose the ability to walk. Ashton's retirement is a blow for West Ham. Having offered the player a five-year deal last season they have now paid him a year's salary, thought to be \u00a33m. The financially-stricken club will hope to recoup more than double that from the FA as Ashton was insured for \u00a37m \u2013 his cost from Norwich in 2006 \u2013 when he was injured on England duty. Last week, Matty Holmes received \u00a3250,000 in damages from the former Wolverhampton defender Kevin Muscat over an ankle injury that the then Charlton player claimed ruined his career. Straumur, the Icelandic bank and largest shareholder in CB Holdings, the company formed to run West Ham, is expected to confirm on Tuesday that its plea for a further debt moratorium has been granted following yesterday's hearing at the Reykjavik district court. The nine-month extension to the moratorium, which will provide Straumur with further breathing space from their creditors until September next year, is regarded as a formality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
