These range from living history role-plays to examining the geological make-up of the mine. There are five former pit ponies on site and two trains - a paddy train, which runs by rope haulage, and a diesel locomotive - both of which pupils can ride on. The museum also has boxes of artefacts that schools can borrow. National Coal Mining Museum, Caphouse Colliery, Wakefield WF4 4RH www.ncm.org.uk Big Pit: National Mining Museum of Wales Former miners lead tours of the coal mine, and pupils can see the engine houses, stables and coal faces where hundreds of men, women and children worked. Pupils learn how coal is extracted, and the guides help them understand the coal-mining community. When pupils resurface, they can learn about modern techniques in the mining galleries. The museum deals with all aspects of mining, from strikes to disasters, from women in mining communities to the children forced to work underground in the 19th century. The extensive resources are geared towards the KS2 curriculum, although they can be adapted for KS3. The museum also has online resources. Big Pit: National Mining Museum of Wales, Blaenafon, Torfaen, NP4 9XP www.nmgw.ac.uk/bigpit Scottish Mining Museum The museum has two major exhibitions: the Story of Coal, which follows man's efforts to extract coal from the 13th century through to modern times; and A Race Apart, which shows what life was like for miners and their families. The museum also features a recreated underground roadway and coalface so pupils can experience the atmosphere and noise of a working pit. The museum's teachers' packs can be used for pre- or post-visit activities.
