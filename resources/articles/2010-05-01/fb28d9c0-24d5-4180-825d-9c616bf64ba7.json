In its annual assessment of progress on meeting the pledge to double aid to Africa, the report by One found that Italy had in fact reduced financial assistance to the world's poorest countries. The west's seven leading industrial nations said at the 2005 Gleneagles summit that they would double aid to Africa to $50bn (\u00a334.6bn) a year, but One said that on current projections only 61% of the extra money would be delivered. Britain would come up with 93% of what it promised, Canada and Japan would both comfortably exceed their modest pledges, and the US would boost aid by more than 150%. But Germany and France were both on course to increase assistance by only 25% each, while Italy's aid budget would be 6% lower in 2010 than in 2005. Jamie Drummond, executive director of One, said: \"Italy's leaders can't be allowed to infect the G7 any longer. They need to be kicked out. The real challenge with judging the G7's promises to Africa is that the awful inaction of governments like Italy's clouds the commendable performances of the UK or the US. \"This suggests the need for a renewed coalition of the willing, where only those seriously committed to partnering with the African people are brought together, along with emerging powers, new technologies and Africa's own rising generation of activists and entrepreneurs.\" The One report said performance by the G7 was linked to the strength of the original commitment and pressure from civil society, but mainly to political will. In a forward to the report, Bono said: \"Activists are, and ought to be, up in arms at the amount of foot-dragging, excuse-making and backsliding, some of which predates the global recession. We've seen Italy's leadership not reflect its people's promise; France and Germany's faltering pace; Canada and Japan's weak promises; and a general, if not universal, slothfulness in meeting commitments to improve aid effectiveness, boost trade and investment, and help Africa reckon with man-made crises, financial and environmental.\" He added: \"The UK's bipartisan commitment to development, and near fulfilment of its promise, stand out as achievements in these hard times, as does President Obama's promise to increase aid over and above the levels President Bush promised and delivered.\" The UK's coalition government has said it will stick to Labour's plan to raise aid spending to the UN target of 0.7% of GDP, but Labour was last night seeking a commitment that the Treasury was not intending to re-classify spending from the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence as aid. \"If the coalition were to meet their promised overseas development assistance increases through an accountancy trick then Britain will not have kept her promise to the world's poorest people. Double-counting cannot be equated to a material increase.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
