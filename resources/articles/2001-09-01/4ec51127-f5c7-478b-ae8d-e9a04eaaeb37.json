Seven stood out from the rest. She lists them here. Bon voyage The Left Bank H\u00f4tel Esmeralda Where: 4 rue St-Julien-le-Pauvre, 5th, metro St-Michel (00 33 1 4354 1920) Why: The location, opposite Notre Dame What: A listed monument, this seventeenth-century building has a lopsided staircase which leads to slightly faded floral rooms that have seen better days. The en suite bathrooms look a bit suspect too. Even the receptionist admits that the hotel's not best known for its modernity or cleanliness, but what it does have is rustic charm and a fabulous location. Step out of the front door and you're steps away from the River Seine, which you can walk along to the Louvre. The higher you go in this four-storey hotel with no lift, the more you see of Notre Dame, which is just across the Seine, although the rooms only offer a sideways view. Room 19 is one of the best. The hotel is opposite a small park which guests can use as a garden. It is also next door to a bike-hire shop and near plenty of small streets selling cheap food. Rooms have phones but no television. Price: \u00a348-\u00a352 double, breakfast \u00a34. H\u00f4tel de Nesle Where: 7 rue de Nesle, 6th, metro Od\u00e9on (00 33 1 4354 6241). Why: Fabulously eccentric hotel minutes on foot from the Louvre and Notre Dame. No reservations, so you can get a room on the day. What: You enter a different world in the H\u00f4tel de Nesle's reception, where the ceiling is covered with hanging dried flowers and the walls with copper utensils. The owner, Madame Ren\u00e9e Busillet, holds court with tales of the hotel's hippy past, though now the spotless hotel is more hip than hippy. Her son has painted different murals in the 20 rooms, from Oriental to colonial. The Arabian-style number 4 has its own steam room. The beds are small, so you'll have to cuddle up. There are no mod cons - no lift, television, phone or breakfast, and half the rooms share a bathroom with one other room. But there is a garden and parking at \u00a38 for 24 hours. Treat yourself to a larger themed room for \u00a365 - in the Moli\u00e8re room, the bed is behind a velvet curtain and there's a chaise longue, candelabra and an impressive marble bathroom. Price: \u00a350 double. H\u00f4tel Saint Jacques Where: 35 rue des Ecoles, 5th, metro Maubert-Mutualit\u00e9 (00 33 1 4407 4545) Why: Romantic hotel near the Luxembourg gardens and the Panth\u00e9on. What: The lounge and breakfast room of this pretty hotel have been decorated with impressionist murals on the walls and the ceiling and the romantic style has been kept up throughout the 35 rooms. It's not surprising that the film Charade with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn was filmed here. Though there is a lift, you have to climb one set of stairs to reach the cheaper rooms on the top floor of the building. You can see the top of Notre Dame over the rooftops from number 31, while number 30 has lovely beams. The rooms are small and simply furnished and only have double beds. If you want to go a bit over budget, the rooms on the lower floors are more spacious, with beautifully painted ceilings and comfortable furnishings. Number 25 has a balcony with a view of Notre Dame and the Panth\u00e9on for \u00a363, while a room just below costs \u00a357. All rooms have telephones and televisions. Price: \u00a347 double. Breakfast \u00a34. Right Bank H\u00f4tel des Croises (H\u00f4tel Langlois) Where: 63 rue Saint-Lazare, 9th, metro Trinit\u00e9 (00 33 1 4874 7824) Why: Beautiful rooms. Near the shopping district and the opera. What: This impressive nineteenth-century building with its traditional wood-panelled reception area and old lift with wrought-iron gate was used to film the remake of Charade, The Truth About Charlie. The hotel will be renamed the Langlois after its film name next year when the film is released. The 27 rooms are huge, and are decorated with period furniture, some with marble fireplaces and wood panelling. Though rooms on the lower floors have been redone and have much larger bathrooms (number 15 is enormous), those on the fifth and sixth floors have more character and are lighter, with good views over Paris's rooftops. From rooms 63 and 64, you can see the top of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, while 62 has a small alcove that can be used as a sitting-room. Rooms have television, phone, minibar and hair dryers. Price: \u00a348-\u00a353 double (slightly higher rates in March, May, June, September, October and December). Breakfast \u00a34. H\u00f4tel Chopin Where: 10 boulevard Montmartre (46 passage Jouffroy), 9th, metro GrandBoulevards (00 33 1 4770 5810). Why: A quiet backwater round the corner from Paris's shops. What: You'll find the Hotel Chopin at the end of the passage Jouffroy, a charming old-fashioned arcade with bookshops and a toy shop from yesteryear. The hotel's facade, which dates from the 1850s with lots of elegant woodwork, fits into the setting perfectly. The quaint and welcoming reception even has a piano in it. The Chopin's corridors, connected by a lift, are lighter and more airy than in most hotels. The 35 rooms have been redone and are comfortably furnished, though the bathrooms aren't wonderful. Those rooms ending in the number 2 are darker and smaller than the others, and are consequently cheaper. Those finishing with a 7 are the best, as are numbers 409, 310 and 412. None of the rooms looks over the street, so this is a very quiet hotel in the centre of Paris. Rooms have phones and television. Price: \u00a345-52 double. Breakfast \u00a34. H\u00f4tel Du Septi\u00e8me Art Where: 20 rue Saint-Paul, 4th, metro St-Paul (00 33 1 4454 8500) Why: A place for movie buffs in the centre of the historic Marais district. What: This hotel is stuffed full of film memorabilia, from Mickey Mouse figurines and posters, to the movie motifs on the bathroom tiles. A black-and-white check floor is the backdrop for the reception and bar, where well-known faces belonging to stars such as Laurel and Hardy can be spotted on the walls. There's a large chimney where a welcoming fire is lit in winter. In the basement, there are a few gym machines that hotel guests can use, plus washing machines for laundry. The 23 bedrooms are simple and basic, though they have phones and televisions. There is no lift connecting the hotel's four floors. Though the street is quiet, if you want an extra peaceful sleep ask for a room that looks on to the courtyard. Price: \u00a346-52 double room with shower, slightly more for room with bath. Breakfast \u00a34.60 Grand H\u00f4tel Jeanne d'Arc Where: 3 rue de Jarente, 4th metro St-Paul (00 33 1 4887 6211) Why: Right by the Place des Vosges in the historic Marais district. What: This quaint stone-built hotel is just off a quiet square with several restaurants offering a reasonably peaceful eating spot. There is a magnificent heraldic mosaic mirror in reception, which is opposite a simple breakfast room. The 36 rooms are basic but well decorated so they are nicer than average, with bigger than usual showers in the bathrooms. It's also just by the imposing place des Vosges, the first planned square in Paris, whose red-bricked buildings with stone arcaded facades were built at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The rooms looking on to the street are better and not much noisier than those overlooking a small courtyard. Price: \u00a348 double room, \u00a35 twin. Breakfast \u00a33.80 \u0095 Jane Knight travelled to Paris with Eurostar (08705 186 186), which takes three hours from Waterloo to the Gare du Nord. Prices start at \u00a379 return for tickets booked 14 days in advance but you must stay on a Saturday or two nights during the week to obtain the cheapest fare.
