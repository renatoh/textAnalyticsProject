My palms are sweaty and my face is flushed. Until a moment ago, I\u2019d been running up the road that leads to Legend\u2019s hilltop house, late because of the traffic. And now I\u2019m sweatily, awkwardly apologising to John Legend in his beautiful living room as he gestures towards another room where there\u2019s a long table by the window that overlooks the morning haze and the distant ridges of the Santa Monica mountains. \u201cLet\u2019s just zen out in this zen dining room,\u201d John Legend says, before looking around the room as if for the first time, running his hands over the dark-wood table, leaning back in his chair, lifting his head. He inhales, exhales, beams. And then he laughs \u2013 a long, deep, rich baritone. The laugh alone is like a song. And the traffic? What traffic? We are in Legend-land. Troubles are distant memories. Legend has this effect on almost everybody, and it has brought him great success. His debut album, 2004\u2019s Get Lifted, sold 3m copies worldwide, and its single, Ordinary People, was so ubiquitous that for a solid chunk of the mid-aughts it was inescapable. His 2013 release, All of Me, written for the model Chrissy Teigen, his then-fianc\u00e9e-now-wife, who he met on a music video shoot, has been played on Spotify more than 1bn times. Legend is still mainly a musician. He goes into the studio most days, and he has his seventh album coming out next year. But lately he\u2019s transformed into something more. He\u2019s on TV all the time, not just as a coach on The Voice, but subbing for Ellen DeGeneres on her show, and playing Jesus in a live on-air version of Jesus Christ Superstar. It makes sense that Legend played Jesus: few entertainers are so broadly popular, and fewer still are the kind of politically engaged moral arbiter of our troubled times that he has become. And yet, despite (or because of) all of that, he has another effect, too. There is something about him, his family, his way of being in the world, that pisses certain people off. In September, Donald Trump tweeted at Legend (\u201cboring musician\u201d) and Teigen (\u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d) after the pair appeared at an event focused on criminal justice held at New York\u2019s notorious Sing Sing prison. Last month, after the release of Legend\u2019s Christmas album, A Legendary Christmas, a collection of originals and classic covers, Piers Morgan described him as \u201cHollywood\u2019s self-appointed Virtue-Signaller-in-Chief\u201d. I mention how I\u2019d been listening to the album that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a mood-enhancer,\u201d Legend says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re humming Christmas songs all summer, it\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d Yet there is one song on the album that a lot of people found not very therapeutic at all, and that song is a cover of Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside. Legend has changed some of the song\u2019s lyrics to be more modern and less \u2013 some would say \u2013 rapey. He knew there was controversy around the original: some radio stations had banned it last winter and it had been cancelled by various factions on the internet. But he thought that changing some lyrics to better reflect our more evolved era, where people are supposed to ask for consent, and include a few other fun modern flourishes, like a plotline featuring an impatient Uber driver named Murray, would be, well: \u201cIt would be fun, and it would be newsworthy. And \u2013 yeah \u2013 it was both.\u201d Legend is downplaying here. Ever since his version was released last month, people \u2013 from Morgan to Dean Martin\u2019s daughter \u2013 have lost their minds about it, exclaiming that the rewritten song is a travesty, an affront, a war on culture or the end of culture itself. This, to Legend, is absurd and exasperating. \u201cThe song was supposed to be silly!\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be preachy at all. I never disparaged the old version. And, by the way, the original writer, or his family, gets paid for my version, too.\u201d Normally, that would be the final word in that particular controversy. But Legend isn\u2019t done with it. He grows thoughtful and leans forward in his seat. He speaks now in a lower, nearly hushed tone. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says, \u201cthis whole backlash to the #MeToo movement. People thinking we\u2019ve gone too far speaking up for a woman\u2019s right to not get raped or sexually harassed, when some would argue we\u2019ve not gone far enough, when we have an admitted sexual assailant in the highest office in the land. People think that because some people have lost their jobs, or have been expelled from Hollywood, like Weinstein, that we\u2019ve gone too far. I don\u2019t agree. But people wanted the Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside war to be a proxy war for all that.\u201d Weird, how that silly, funny song suddenly got very serious. It says a lot about where we are as a hyper-polarised, extremely online society in 2019. It also says quite a lot about who Legend is, not just as a politically engaged entertainer or as a hyper-talented youngest ever EGOT-getter (that\u2019s his Emmy and 10 Grammys and Oscar and Tony ); or as a father of two; or as a husband to the supermodel-slash-Queen of Twitter-slash-disarmingly honest lifestyle guru Teigen. No, the way to understand why it is that Legend can suddenly turn a silly song serious is that these are serious, fearful times. And the only way to match all the fear in our world is with a kind of radical, all encompassing love. But, first, give him a minute to explain what he means by love, exactly. To get there, you must first understand a criticism Legend receives, which is nicely summarised by Trump\u2019s tweet. Here\u2019s a popular singer, on TV, talking about criminal justice. What does he know? What right does he have? The thing is, Legend has been involved in prison reform for years. Also: education, poverty, HIV/Aids, disaster relief, food security, drug policy, childcare, military aid\u2026 People look at Legend, see all this do-gooder activism, and think to themselves: he can\u2019t be for real, he can\u2019t mean all this. Isn\u2019t this just so much virtue signalling? \u201cI don\u2019t know what virtue signalling is supposed to be,\u201d he says. \u201cI get that people don\u2019t like people who are overly preachy or overly moralising. But, in my humble opinion, if you care about people who are often undervalued and overlooked in society, what\u2019s so negative about that? There seem to be some who think that standing up for immigrants whose kids are getting locked up in cages is\u2026 some might call that virtue signalling and some might think speaking up against it is absolutely right.\u201d There\u2019s a certainty to what he says and the way he says it that is absolutely correct and totally annoying. That\u2019s the thing with people who have such a firm grip on their moral compass: they shame the rest of us. Legend is good. While the rest of us are just trying to catch our breath, flushed and sweaty and jittery. But then he reaches out a hand for a shake and pulls you right in and soothes you. Maybe you recoil. Or maybe you just give in. Fifteen years ago, I saw Legend on stage for the first time, belting out the backups and choruses at a Kanye West concert, already clearly en route to becoming a star. A year earlier he had been performing under his given name, John Stephens, in tiny jazz clubs throughout Philadelphia and New York as he worked a day job at the Boston Consulting Group. Then he and Kanye met, Kanye gave him the name Legend, and the rest, as they say, is history. But what is most striking about Legend back then versus Legend now is that the two people \u2013 John Legend and John Stephens \u2013 seem one and the same. Legend remembers that night as if it was yesterday, correcting me on some details, describing it as \u201cthe beginning\u201d. I ask him about his and Kanye\u2019s divergent paths, both artistically and politically, and offer up a theory I heard from another Kanye collaborator: that Kanye\u2019s core beliefs in music and art and politics and everything, all of it, stems from the relentless pursuit of freedom. His quest for freedom is what led him to fashion, to Jesus, to supporting Trump. Legend agrees. \u201cHe wants to do what he thinks is the boldest, most unexpected and free thing,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously I vehemently disagreed with the turn it took when it came to Trump, but I think that\u2019s a common thread when it comes to the creative and life choices he\u2019s made.\u201d Does Legend have a core belief like that? Something that can be summed up in a word? \u201cI think, yes, I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI think about love.\u201d He takes a beat. \u201cLove as a public virtue.\u201d He shifts in his seat now, getting serious again. \u201cLove in public is what Cornel West called justice, the idea that you value people\u2019s lives no matter who they are or where they live or how different they are from you. All the differences we have, if you have the ability to love your neighbour, or not just your neighbour but \u2013 in church they defined neighbour as broadly as possible. And so I feel like \u2013 and I don\u2019t always get it right \u2013 it\u2019s that we should love our neighbour, which is everyone, as we love ourselves.\u201d This is a radical thing, a radical love. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do.\u201d Legend has talked about this philosophy before, in a 2014 graduation speech he delivered at the University of Pennsylvania, his alma mater. \u201cThe key to success, the key to happiness, is opening your mind and your heart to love,\u201d he told the graduates. He went on to tell the story of his upbringing in Springfield, Ohio \u2013 a small, blue-collar city where he was surrounded by family: four siblings and two parents \u201cwho cared so much about our education that they home-schooled us for several years during grade school.\u201d His parents took in foster kids, helped the homeless, and were, Legend says, \u201clike a model family in our church and local community.\u201d But when Legend was 10, things fell apart. His grandmother died and his mother fell into a depression that would tear the family apart. His parents eventually divorced. His mother disappeared from his life for more than a decade, addicted to drugs and sinking ever further into depression. \u201cMy world was shattered,\u201d he said. He coped by deciding that \u201cif I didn\u2019t fall in love, no one could ever betray me like that again.\u201d The only thing he allowed himself to love fully and without reservation was music and it was this love that gave him his career, the success and the money and the beautiful zen dining room with a view of the mountains. More than all of that, the love gave him the ability to forgive his mother. It was the love that gives him daily the capacity to take a deep breath and cooly and with great strength and certainty dive into the fray, haters be damned. \u201cWhen you actually care about something, you want to lead. Apathy\u2019s not so cool any more,\u201d he told the graduates. Which is another way of explaining why, even when talking about a silly old Christmas song and its modern rewrite, things can quickly turn so serious. It\u2019s love. This core philosophy resides most fully in his life here at home. If you follow either Legend or, especially, Teigen on social media, you already have quite a good sense of what this life looks like. Even stepping into their home is like entering a bizarre world you\u2019ve seen online and in magazine spreads. There\u2019s no facade. There\u2019s no mask. Legend wakes up at 6.30am, hangs out with his kids, works out, takes the kids to preschool (Luna, three) and music class (Miles, one), goes to the studio around noon, works until dinner, comes home, tucks the kids into bed. \u201cThen I sit at home with Chrissy and watch reality shows and drink wine and live to face another day.\u201d On Sundays he watches a lot of American football. He\u2019s pretty sure the only surprise people would have about his life is that he rarely hangs out with other celebrities. There\u2019s something radical in this, too \u2013 this normal, good, loving life lived openly and transparently. When we\u2019re talking about his Christmas album, Legend mentions one of his biggest musical influences and in many ways the model for his career: the great jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole. Legend covers Cole\u2019s immortal Christmas Song on the album, but the influence goes far beyond just vocal stylings and keyboard chops. Cole was a trailblazer, the first black man ever to host a variety show on TV. He might not have been as outspoken as Legend, but to see him as apolitical is to read him, and history, wrong. The racism he faced as one of the most popular entertainers in America was relentless and horrific. When he moved his family into a wealthy all-white neighbourhood in Los Angeles in 1948, the neighbours burned the N-word in his lawn and killed his dog. His show was cancelled after a year because no major sponsor wanted to touch it. \u201cNat King Cole\u2019s very existence was controversial,\u201d Legend says. There is no escaping the fact that Legend\u2019s existence, this life he is leading so happily and openly and successfully, is controversial to certain groups of people, too. Controversial is possibly too nice a word for it. Nobody is more aware of this uneasy truth than Legend himself. He reads his Twitter mentions. He is reminded daily, in the messages he receives online, of the haters, the racists, the bile spewed towards him and his family. Even today, on this nice zenned-out morning, he is bracing for the onslaught. Later on, he will be named People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive. He says this offhandedly, like, can you believe it? I ask him if he\u2019s happy about it and he says he is, but he immediately adds that, truly, \u201cthis is a double- edged sword\u201d. For the next several weeks he\u2019ll be hearing all about all the other, sexier men who deserved the title more than he. And that is honestly sort of funny, but there\u2019s a more sinister edge to it that he would rather not think about. All the gross hate that bubbles up when he triumphs in just about anything. \u201cMaybe this is a day I don\u2019t check my mentions,\u201d he says. And yet, he goes on. \u201cI see what\u2019s happening and I feel compelled to say something. I could choose not to wade into these controversies. I realise it comes at some risk. But I just\u2026\u201d He stops. For the first time in our conversation it feels as if the flow has been interrupted, like he\u2019s searching for the right word. \u201cI just feel like \u2013 I can\u2019t not.\u201d He laughs at himself, at the honesty betrayed by the inarticulate phrase. He\u2019s right, of course. Not an hour after I leave that morning, just a few hours before he\u2019s officially crowned Sexiest Man Alive, he\u2019s tweeting about White House senior advisor Stephen Miller\u2019s recently uncovered racist emails. Of course he would be. He can\u2019t not. John Legend\u2019s album A Legendary Christmas is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
