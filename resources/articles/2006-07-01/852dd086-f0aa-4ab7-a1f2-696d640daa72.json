Today Whitaker will ride Cullawn Diamond, who was fourth here two years ago, as well as his long standing partner, Lactic II. 'He felt really good,' Whitaker said of Cullawn Diamond, after riding the 12-year-old for the first time in yesterday's Hickstead Derby Trophy in which he had a single rail down. 'He's been round here a few times and he's shown some good form, so I'm quite hopeful.' Ben Maher is on course to repeat last year's momentous double, having won yesterday's Speed Derby for the second time on Mercurius. Clear in 95.21sec, he defeated Ireland's Shane Breen on Mullaghdrin Gold Rain (96.16) and Ellen Whitaker on Henri de Herne. Maher will be aiming to complete the double today with another Derby victory on Alfredo. Earlier, Duncan Inglis had his second victory of the show with Sunkist, when he won the Derby Trophy. His nine-year-old daughter, Amy, added to the family's pleasure by winning at Bicton in Devon yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
