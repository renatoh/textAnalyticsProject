The latter flies through fast passages with a Django Reinhardt-like lightness, and plays ballads with a caressing, jazz-guitar purr, and Husband stays so close to him he seems like an alter ego \u2013 sometimes adopting an almost Ellingtonesque swing in the fast contrapuntal passages, and often improvising with a fluency that recalls Chick Corea (who writes an unqualified eulogy to this music in the artwork). Some tracks have a beboppish drive; there are rapturous ballads penetrated by Machacek's singing, single-note sound; a little ambient mistiness; and even a bluegrass-influenced tune that soon turns funky. Some episodes are rather whimsical, but it's all very elegantly played, and the slow-building but eventually ecstatic Spring Song is a standout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
