His remedy for this condition (a cure that seems hardly better than the disease) requires the establishment of an authority absolute in all matters of public doctrine, including religion. Hobbes's systematic assault on the political power of the clergy ensured that his books would be burned and that his name would soon become a byword for atheism and infidelity. By the end of the 17th century the caricature of Hobbes as an eccentric apologist for irreligion and despotism was firmly in place. Hobbes was, and still is, portrayed as an isolated thinker out of touch with the mainstream of Enlightenment thought. Noel Malcolm's outstanding research has done much to revise this two-dimensional view of Hobbes's work. Aspects of Hobbes brings together for the first time Malcolm's published essays on Hobbes with extensive new contributions, many of which substantially alter our understanding of the great philosopher, his relationship with his contemporaries and his intellectual legacy. Malcolm's formidable intellectual range matches that of his subject. His work deals with Hobbes's diverse interests in political philosophy, international relations theory, mechanistic science and biblical criticism, as well as casting light upon Hobbes's intellectual milieu and the reception of his thought. Taken together, the essays amount to an impressive case for the claim that Hobbes was one of the most important and influential thinkers of the early modern period. Born in 1588, the son of a poor country clergyman in Westport, Malmesbury, Hobbes was educated at Oxford and went on to serve as tutor and secretary to William Cavendish (later the second Earl of Devonshire). Malcolm's meticulously researched essays on Hobbes's early career demonstrate that the Cavendish connection was crucial in introducing Hobbes to the two fields that would dominate his intellectual career: political philosophy and science. Hobbes entered the murky world of Jacobean politics through his representation of Cavendish interests in the Virginia Company. His passion for science was stimulated by his contact with his employer's cousins, the Earl of Newcastle and Sir Charles Cavendish. As keen experimenters, the brothers fostered the work of scientists including Robert Payne who may, as Malcolm suggests, have acted as Hobbes's mentor. Hobbes's passion for the new science was fuelled by visits to the Continent where his association with Marin Mersenne connected him to a large European network of scientists and philosophers. Hobbes became fascinated with the phenomenon of motion and convinced that the study of matter in motion could form the basis for a complete system of philosophy. He proposed to expound his ideas under three headings: body, man and citizen, each to be considered in similar mechanistic terms. As England began to slide towards civil war in 1640, Newcastle asked Hobbes to produce a political argument based upon his new approach. The result was the first draft of his political philosophy, the Elements of Law, which formed the basis for his treatise on the citizen, De Cive (1642). The worsening political situation led Hobbes to fear being held to account for the uncompromising absolutism of Elements and he fled to France, remaining there for the next 11 years. This period turned out to be the crucial phase of his intellectual development. Malcolm shows how Hobbes's contacts with Mersenne, the neo-Epicurean Gassendi and particularly the mathematician Roberval helped him to work out the details of his new scientific system in opposition to traditional scholasticism and Cartesianism. As England's answer to Descartes, much was expected of Hobbes, but in 1649 he put aside his scientific project to begin work on Leviathan. Most probably the book was a response to the political revolution that followed the execution of Charles I. Royalists were required to submit to the new republic, and Hobbes's theory, with its defence of sovereignty rather than any particular kind of regime, showed how it might be legitimate for them to do so. Crucially Hobbes also took the opportunity to develop his religious views, but it was these arguments that would ultimately cause the long-term damage to his reputation. The pattern of Hobbes's heterodoxy is revealed in Malcolm's essay on Hobbes's biblical scholarship. Hobbes, typically, transformed a mainstream tendency to recognise the human aspects of scripture into an argument for treating the Bible as a flawed historical text. On this basis he would go on to deny Moses' authorship of the Pentateuch, a view that put him firmly beyond the pale. Such doctrines ensured that he was soon a marked man in Paris and precipitated another flight home in 1651. Hobbes returned to the service of the Earl of Devonshire and his scientific work, but this was now compromised by the notoriety of Leviathan. As Malcolm suggests, to many critics Leviathan seemed to demonstrate a link between the new science and atheism. As a consequence even those scientists who had previously praised Hobbes now felt the need to distance themselves from him. The result was that when the Royal Society was formed after the Restoration, Hobbes was deliberately excluded. This general pattern of public rejection would become all too familiar as the chorus of criticism grew, particularly during the 1670s when Hobbes began to be cast alongside Spinoza as the founding father of anti-Christian radicalism. However, as Malcolm's excellent essay on Hobbes's European reception makes clear, public rejection did not prevent others using his ideas. Hobbesian formulae appear in the works of Catholic absolutists, such as Bossuet, and Dutch republicans, including Spinoza, not to mention mainstream natural law writers such as Samuel Pufendorf. The hysteria generated by Hobbes's name made these writers cautious in acknowledging their intellectual debts; indeed Pufendorf was forced to rebrand himself as a critic of Hobbes to escape damaging accusations of Hobbism. Some philosophers were more open in their praise for the English philosopher however; Leibniz was moved to declare that no philosopher had philosophised as precisely, clearly and elegantly as Hobbes. This (often subterranean) influence on mainstream traditions leads Malcolm to the claim that Hobbes needs to be recognised as a major contributor to Enlightenment thought, one perhaps far more significant in the long term than Spinoza. This thesis is supported by a recurrent theme in Malcolm's essays. He argues that a central feature of Hobbes's various projects was a desire to liberate individuals from falsehood and the corrupting power of special interest groups, whether they were priests, demagogues or intellectual elites. Hobbes sought to demystify natural and political processes through a philosophical system that was, above all, clear and comprehensible. His hope was that if his doctrines were adopted, rational justification would provide the basis for political stability not only within states, but also between them. One implication of Malcolm's position is that, far from encouraging arbitrary despotism and mutual hostility between states, Hobbes wanted to produce a theory that would effectively preclude both. Hobbes was largely written out of the history of the Enlightenment by the intellectual elite who made up the Republic of Letters. Malcolm's emphasis upon the emancipatory and ultimately enlightened character of his project rightly demands that he should be written back in. \u00b7 Jon Parkin is lecturer in politics at the University of York.
