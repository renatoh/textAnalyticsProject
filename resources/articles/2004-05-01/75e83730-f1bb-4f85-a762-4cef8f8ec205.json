There will always be periods when your personal life is in danger of total eclipse but be wary of accepting it as the norm. To acknowledge that, you have to be extremely focused for short periods and to do that without resentment is sensible. To allow that way of working to stretch into years is dangerous. Other relationships and a social life take time to create and sustain; if you neglect them for long periods, they may not be there to fall back on when you need them. There is always something you can cut back on. Look objectively at how you spend your time at work. Whose expectations are you trying to meet and how reasonable are they? Is the pressure you're experiencing self-imposed? When you're new in a job it's easy to agree to everything, practise saying \"No\". Explore the possibility of using some of your work time for your study. Think about the standards you set for yourself: are you too much of a perfectionist? Experiment with the concept of good enough, rather than feeling you always have to produce the very best. Avoid the trap of regarding busyness as a status symbol and a sign of success. Your ideas, energy and enthusiasm can be as valuable as the hours you put in. These are quickly eroded by tiredness. Got a career problem?
