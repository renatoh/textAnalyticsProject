Speaking in Washington after talks with the US director of homeland security, Tom Ridge, Mr Blunkett announced the a new US-UK working group to combat international terrorism. In a chilling admission, the home secretary said: \"Because we are partners in Iraq we need to be more aware than others in the world would like to believe they need to be.\" He went on to announce \"joint exercises\" between the US and UK to \"formulate necessary steps to protect us from simultaneous attack\". Mr Ridge echoed that America would \"prepare and work on the possibility of simultaneous attacks\". Mr Blunkett revealed that the joint working group would \"share and develop best practice\" on a number of counterterrorism measures, including border controls, passport controls, combatting cyber and electronic attack and the tracing of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. He said the world should now be \"preparing to face a very different world\" since September 11. Further details of exactly how the joint working and contact group between the department of homeland security and the Home Office were not forthcoming. Mr Blunkett appeared to suggest that he may consider introducing a British equivalent of the colour-coded terrorism alert warnings used in the USA. Mr Ridge praised the UK's \"extensive experience of battling terrorimsm\", and called Britain a \"critically important ally\". Earlier this year Mr Ridge visited the UK to consult over anti-terrorism measures, and today's announcement was described as the work of \"months of cooperation\". Tony Blair has come under domestic criticism for not replacing the junior Home Office minister, John Denham, whose brief covered UK security, and who resigned from his post over the government's attack on Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
