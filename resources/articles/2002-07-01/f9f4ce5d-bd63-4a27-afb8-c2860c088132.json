Joubert, pipped to the vacant Springbok coaching role by Rudolf Straeuli, has been head-hunted by the South African union to take charge of a Super 12 side next year, thought to be the Blue Bulls. Young is a coaching novice in comparison and has been put in charge while still registered with Cardiff as a player. The 34-year-old prop, who won 51 caps for Wales, had been expecting to coach the forwards next season but now finds himself facing a significantly more demanding role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
