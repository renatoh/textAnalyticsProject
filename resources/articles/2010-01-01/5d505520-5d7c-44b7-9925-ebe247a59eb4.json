Ian King, a dry-stone waller from Yorkshire, has taken the process another step further by teaming up with producer Adrian Sherman, best known for his dub experiments with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, and with Skip \"Little Axe\" McDonald, the blues exponent who worked in the house band for the rap label Sugar Hill. The result is an album that succeeds because King is an impressive guitarist and banjo player with a sturdy, no-nonsense voice, and the often subtle dub effects are used carefully to enhance the songs. So there's the echoing brass work on a slinky, rhythmic treatment of Adieu to Old England, a thoughtful, violin-backed reworking of Flash Company, and a compelling a cappella version of Old Miner, in which King's voice is matched against that of hip-hop singer Ghetto Priest. Shirley Collins, herself responsible for some of the bravest folk experiments of the 1960s, calls the album \"elegant, witty, daring and powerful\" \u2013 and she's right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
