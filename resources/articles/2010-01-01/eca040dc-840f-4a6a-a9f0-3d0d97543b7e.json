Instead of snowstorms, Scotland, Wales and south-west and north-west England were bracing themselves for heavy rain this weekend after the Met Office issued severe weather warnings. Rivers were swamped by excess rainwater in areas where the ground remained frozen. Environment Agency teams were clearing blockages. High winds were recorded in parts of Scotland, with gusts reaching up to 75mph yesterday in the Northern Isles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
