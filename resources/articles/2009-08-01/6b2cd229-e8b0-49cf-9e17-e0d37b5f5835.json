The Office", "bodyText": "Scheduler's leftovers, you might call it \u2013 but that would be mean. BBC2's decision to devote tomorrow evening to the entire first series of The Office is of course a way of filling a quiet Sunday and (depressing thought alert) the last Bank Holiday weekend till Christmas as cheaply and cheerfully as possible. But it also allows viewers a good long wallow in the best British sitcom of the past decade. In writing a comedy about a team at paper firm Wernham Hogg, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created a whole bunch of memorable characters \u2013 not just deluded regional manager David Brent (played by Gervais, who turned him into a protagonist to rival Captain Mainwaring and Basil Fawlty), but sales reps Tim Canterbury and Gareth Keenann \u2013 and of course Keith, the scotch-egg eating mystery man of the Accounts Department. First on screen in July 2001, The Office also introduced a range of formal innovations. The lack of a laughter track, the rugged mockumentary style, the way in which scenes never ended on a gag but fizzled out on a long pause \u2013 the influence on Peep Show and others is easy enough to trace. At the time, this was dangerous territory for a sitcom to occupy. Writing in this paper, Arthur Smith declared: \"It is probably too subtle to go on BBC1.\" He was wrong: the warmth of the writing and the sheer quality of the jokes soon converted the mainstream. \"We're like Morecambe and Wise,\" Brent tells the camera at one point. \"Except there's no deadwood.\" Truly, comedy genius."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
