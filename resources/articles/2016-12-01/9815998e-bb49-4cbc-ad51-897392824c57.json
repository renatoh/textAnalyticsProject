An Uber spokeswoman said on Monday that engineers were working to fix a flaw in the programming that advocates feared could have deadly consequences for cyclists. Uber began piloting its self-driving vehicles in its home town of San Francisco last week, despite state officials\u2019 declaration that the ride-share company needed special permits to test its technology. On day one, numerous autonomous vehicles \u2013 which have a driver in the front seat who can take control \u2013 were caught running red lights and committing a range of traffic violations. Despite threats of legal action from the department of motor vehicles (DMV) and California\u2019s attorney general, Kamala Harris, Uber refused to back down on Friday, claiming its rejection of government authority was \u201can important issue of principle\u201d. Concerns are mounting about how the cars behave in dense urban environments, particularly in San Francisco, where there are an estimated 82,000 bike trips each day across more than 200 miles of cycling lanes. The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition has released a warning about Uber\u2019s cars based on staff members\u2019 first-hand experiences in the vehicles. When the car was in \u201cself-driving\u201d mode, the coalition\u2019s executive director, who tested the car two days before the launch, observed it twice making an \u201cunsafe right-hook-style turn through a bike lane\u201d. That means the car crossed the bike path at the last minute in a manner that posed a direct threat to cyclists. The maneuver also appears to violate state law, which mandates that a right-turning car merge into the bike lane before making the turn to avoid a crash with a cyclist who is continuing forward. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest causes of collisions,\u201d said coalition spokesman Chris Cassidy, noting that the group warned Uber of the problem. Company officials told the coalition that Uber was working on the issue but failed to mention that the self-driving program would begin two days later without permits, he said. \u201cThe fact that they know there\u2019s a dangerous flaw in the technology and persisted in a surprise launch,\u201d he said, \u201cshows a reckless disregard for the safety of people in our streets.\u201d Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler told the Guardian in an email that \u201cengineers are continuing to work on the problem\u201d, and said that the company has instructed drivers to take control when approaching right turns on a street with a bike lane. She did not respond to questions about how the cars, Volvo XC90s, detect cyclists and what kind of training and testing the firm conducted before implementation. Linda Bailey, executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, which has raised formal objections to partially automated vehicles, said research raises serious alarms about the ability of drivers to properly intervene in semi-autonomous cars. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that people are not good at paying attention,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for enough people to die for something to happen. It\u2019s not a great way to make policy.\u201d Local advocates noted that the Uber cars have been caught doing four out of the top five causes of collisions or injuries in the city \u2013 running red lights, going through stop signs, unsafe turns and failing to yield to pedestrians. \u201cThese behaviors we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Nicole Ferrara, executive director of advocacy group Walk San Francisco, \u201care some of the most dangerous behaviors in San Francisco that lead to traffic deaths and severe injuries.\u201d Carlo Ratti, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and director of the Senseable City Lab, noted that the only way to expand self-driving technology is to start testing cars in the real world. But he said the programs must be done in cooperation with regulators, especially considering that the vehicles have to make complex ethical and moral decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s important that government has a say into how the car is programmed,\u201d he said. Imperfect self-driving vehicles could still be significantly safer than traditional cars, said Jeffrey Tumlin, director of Oakland\u2019s department of transportation. But he also noted that \u201cbike lanes present a unique challenge for driverless technology\u201d, because cyclists are agile and can travel at high speeds. \u201cIt can be more difficult to predict their behavior,\u201d he said, explaining that engineers are already struggling to navigate vehicle responses to pedestrians, which tend to be simpler. Tumlin said the technology could help improve safety in the long run, but added, \u201cI get uncomfortable with private industry doing their experimentation in the public right of way without first collaborating with the public.\u201d Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
