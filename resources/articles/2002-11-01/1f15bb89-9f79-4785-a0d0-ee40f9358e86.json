The airport was closed but no visits were curtailed and future trips were going ahead with revised itineraries. Brian Wood, Latin-America product manager for Travelbag Adventures, said: \"Most visitors stay a night in Quito on their journeys in and out of Ecuador. But many international flights also touch down at Guayaquil, the second city and the port for the Galapagos islands. We have two small groups in Ecuador but we have been able to re-route them away from Quito.\" Although the erupting volcano is 60 miles north-east of Quito, beyond the main Andes range, ash and steam blanketed the city, disrupting transport and causing power cuts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
