On Sunday, the 23-year-old midfielder is set to captain her childhood club, Manchester United, in a second derby when the Reds welcome City to Leigh Sports Village in the Continental League Cup. \u201cI really liked the lifestyle out there and it was sunny so that helped, but I had signed for two years, so if it wasn\u2019t for United I probably would have stayed,\u201d she says. Zelem was one of many United centre of excellence products forced to find another club once they hit 16 because of the lack of a women\u2019s team. However, with United taking advantage of the restructure of the pyramid to launch a team into the Championship last season, when the approach came from the new manager, Casey Stoney, it was a no\u2011brainer for the lifelong fan. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. When I was little I didn\u2019t even think they\u2019d have a first team, let alone that I\u2019d be walking out at the Etihad in front of over 30,000.\u201d That showpiece opener to the new Women\u2019s Super League season, which United lost 1-0, was followed by the visit of the league champions, Arsenal, to throw them into the deep end in their first top-flight campaign. \u201cWhen the fixtures came out I was like: \u2018Cheers,\u2019\u201d says Stoney, sarcastically. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have to sell preseason, because we\u2019ve got Manchester City at the Etihad, then we play the champions. Straight away, I knew where we were at.\u201d They held their own, though. \u201cPeople are a little bit surprised,\u201d says Zelem. \u201cWe conceded two goals against the two top teams, and then had two clean sheets.\u201d They are settled in fourth place in the league, with back-to-back wins against struggling Liverpool and Tottenham, who were also promoted. The visit of City may be lower key than the game at the Etihad but the atmosphere at their home ground is likely to be as fiery, if not more so. \u201cWhen we\u2019re struggling, they\u2019re loud, and that really helps to bring us up,\u201d says Zelem. \u201cWhen we\u2019re going on the attack, you can hear them and you can feel the energy around the crowd and that certainly passes on to the pitch.\u201d One of the loudest is her father, the former Macclesfield goalkeeper Alan Zelem. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can\u2019t hear my dad,\u201d she says with a laugh. He may be supportive but Alan is also her biggest critic. \u201cHe\u2019s never on my side. I could have the best game of my life and he\u2019ll tell me about the pass in the 12th minute that went too far to the left. \u201cSo I\u2019ll give him a few minutes to chat in my ear and then he\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh, you did well,\u2019 and my mum\u2019s going: \u2018Alan, Alan, be nice.\u2019 But he played football himself. He wants the best for me and he knows what I can do and he\u2019s just pushing me and that\u2019s so good to have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
