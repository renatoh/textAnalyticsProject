The fast bowler and his Pakistan team-mates suffered a frustrating weekend at Shenley with rain interrupting Saturday's limited-overs clash against West Indies A before washing out yesterday's match without a single ball being bowled. The games were seen as an ideal opportunity for Shoaib, who has been out of action since January with a stress fracture of his ankle, to gauge his fitness ahead of the final Test of a series that England lead 2-0. Before the weekend Woolmer indicated that Shoaib would have to send down at least 15 overs on each of the two days to stand a chance of playing at The Oval. But despite the 31-year-old fast bowler falling short of that target, the Pakistan coach is refusing to completely rule him out. \"We saw enough of Shoaib yesterday to hold on to him and we'll make a decision later on in the week as to whether we play him or not,\" Woolmer said yesterday. \"We're erring on the cautionary side. He did look very fit though obviously short of match practice, but overall I thought he looked very good. \"The plan had been for him to bowl at least 30 overs for him to be ready. Everything happens for a reason and maybe this is a sign that he is not ready to play in a Test match. But it's not just up to me, there's the captain involved and a whole medical team as well, not to mention Shoaib himself. I'll go away and talk to them and then we'll decide.\" Although there remains a theoretical chance of Shoaib playing at The Oval, it would seem more likely that he will make his return to international cricket during the one-day series which begins on August 30. \"The management think that if he is ready for the five one-day internationals then that would be the perfect scenario,\" Woolmer said. \"He'll have 10 overs a game and he can really start to get fit and then he's got the ICC [Champions] Trophy.\" Despite being resigned to defeat in the Test series Woolmer is eager for his team to produce a performance that can restore some pride ahead of the one-day series. \"There are a lot of positives to come out of this series,\" he said. \"There have been a lot of disappointments but we can't just sit back and worry about them, we have to move on. The Oval pitch rewards bowlers who bowl well but I don't expect anything other than players to play to the best of their ability. If we can play to our potential and reduce the number of errors we made in the last Test match then we have an equal chance.\" Woolmer admits he has been impressed with the way Andrew Strauss has captained England in place of the injured Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff. \"Andrew's done well and he's led the team from the front. He's obviously captaincy material,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
