There's precious little else apart from casinos and some wreck diving. A big oil refinery and its resulting pollution have killed off all the coral. We found food and hotels very expensive, and the Wyndham tried to charge us twice - once when we checked out and again three months later! As most of the clientele are Americans, the food portions were enormous, but everywhere we went there was a \"plate charge\" for sharing, which cost the equivalent of a meal. My vote for a fun-packed week closer to home - if you haven't been already - would be for a fly-drive visit to Florida.
