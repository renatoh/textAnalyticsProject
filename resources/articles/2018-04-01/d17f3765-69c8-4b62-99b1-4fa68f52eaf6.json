One day it could also sport a blue plaque on its front wall, informing passersby that \u201cEnoch Powell, 1912-1998, Conservative MP, lived here\u201d. These few words would not reflect Powell\u2019s legacy, nor reveal the strength of feeling of many city residents against the erection of a monument to their erstwhile MP. Among others, Clive Gregory, the bishop of Wolverhampton, speaking on behalf of local faith organisations, has strongly opposed the idea, saying it would be \u201cwidely interpreted as honouring Enoch Powell\u2019s racist views\u201d. Nominations for a plaque have been received by the Wolverhampton Civic and Historical Society, which will consider them this year if they turn into a formal application. A decision on whether to proceed could come within months of Friday\u2019s 50th anniversary of the politician\u2019s inflammatory anti-immigration \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech. Powell, who represented Wolverhampton South West for almost a quarter of a century, caused outrage with the speech he made in Birmingham on 20 April 1968. He claimed constituents had told him Britain would soon not be worth living in as a result of immigrants and their descendants. \u201cIt is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see \u2018the river Tiber foaming with much blood\u2019.\u201d The full speech, interspersed with analysis, is to be read by an actor in a BBC radio documentary this weekend. Online promotion of it by the presenter, Amol Rajan, prompted Dr Shirin Hirsch, an expert on Powell, to demand her contribution be removed altogether; a request the BBC acceded to on Friday. The programme also prompted criticism from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis. In a letter to the media regulator, Ofcom, demanding the cancellation of the programme, Lord Adonis described it as \u201cthe most incendiary racist speech of modern Britain\u201d. The day after his speech, Powell was sacked as shadow defence minister by the Conservative leader Edward Heath. Rival demonstrations for and against Powell took place in Wolverhampton. In London, 1,000 dockers walked out on strike in support of the MP, some bearing placards saying \u201cBack Britain, not Black Britain\u201d. \u201cThe speech had an immediate impact, with 12 reports of racist attacks in the area in the two weeks that followed,\u201d said Hirsch, an academic at the University of Wolverhampton, whose book In The Shadow Of Enoch Powell: Race, Locality and Resistance will be published in the autumn. \u201cBlack and Asian people I\u2019ve interviewed speak of real fear in the weeks and months after Powell\u2019s speech.\u201d Wolverhampton at the time was a \u201cboom town\u201d, she said, with no shortage of work for migrants arriving from Commonwealth countries. Many took jobs in the NHS, public transport, factories and foundries, often living in multi-occupancy homes where beds were slept in on a rotation basis to match shift patterns. \u201cPreviously there were local stories of interracial marriages and people organising in the workplace. But after the rivers of blood speech, immigrant communities were forced to organise to defend themselves against racist violence. The locals left were in disarray as they watched sections of workers walk out on strike in support of Powell,\u201d Hirsch said. Angela Spence, who was six at the time of Powell\u2019s speech, has no recollection of the event, \u201cbut I grew up recognising that he was a very divisive and toxic figure\u201d. Her parents had come to Wolverhampton from Jamaica. \u201cWe lived in a street where we had neighbours from Fiji, Pakistan, India, all parts of the Caribbean, Poland, Italy \u2013 and people who had been born in Britain. It was incredibly diverse but very harmonious, very neighbourly.\u201d The family was politically aware. \u201cAs I grew up I remember my parents talking about friends who were facing negative views, which were probably exacerbated by the speech and sentiments around it.\u201d Spence attended West Park primary school, which had attracted national attention weeks earlier when Powell referred to it in another speech, claiming it had only one white pupil. A photograph of two boys, one white and one black, was carried in most newspapers. \u201cIt was a complete lie,\u201d said Mike Edwards, 59, the white boy pictured alongside his best friend, Ray Comrie. Other white pupils included his brothers and cousins, he said. The spotlight on the school and the rivers of blood speech had an immediate impact. \u201cBefore we were just kids, and afterwards I was white and they were black. I can remember seeing graffiti on my way to school after the speech, saying \u2018Nigger, go home\u2019, that sort of thing. I had to ask my mum what it meant.\u201d Some now fear the tensions stoked by the speech half a century ago could be reignited by the blue plaque suggestion. Critics accuse the local paper, the Express and Star, of fomenting division by running an online poll, in which 70% of 20,000 respondents backed the idea. Some opponents claim the link to the poll was shared by Ukip supporters far from Wolverhampton. Supporters of the plaque include Nigel Hastilow, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate who was dropped in 2007 after writing a newspaper column arguing \u201cEnoch Powell was right\u201d. In a debate on the proposal in February, Hastilow said: \u201cPeople of significance in history, whether you agree with them or disagree, should be remembered. Powell is arguably one of the greatest politicians of the last century.\u201d According to Hirsch, \u201cplaques are intended to celebrate a notable figure. But the rivers of blood speech was not an interesting curiosity, it was a powerful and threatening message whose impact is still being felt. You cannot separate the racism from the man.\u201d The Rev Ray Gaston of St Chad and St Mark\u2019s church in what used to be Powell\u2019s parish, and a key figure in the campaign group Black Country Stand Up To Racism, said the broader backdrop to the plaque proposal was hostility towards refugees, a fear of diversity and growing Islamophobia. \u201cIt feeds into a cultural mood that needs to be resisted.\u201d The area was what sociologists called \u201csuper-diverse\u201d, he said. \u201cThere are different communities, several languages spoken, a significant number of asylum seekers. Powell would see this as a nightmare, but I see much hope and possibility. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for migration and refugees, this church would be on its last legs. Instead it\u2019s going through renewal. There\u2019s a new Christian culture developing here.\u201d A straw poll of a dozen students at the University of Wolverhampton last week found most had never heard of Powell or his speech, and all were relaxed about living in a diverse city. But perhaps the biggest riposte comes from Eleanor Smith, who was elected last year in Powell\u2019s former seat as the city\u2019s first MP from an African-Caribbean background. Like her fellow Wolverhampton MPs, she is a staunch opponent of the plaque proposal. Smith was 10 when Powell delivered the speech. \u201cHe sought to divide the city and the country, and divide working people. I remember being called names, and these things remain in your head,\u201d she said. \u201cBut almost 50 years on, the people of Wolverhampton voted for me, a black woman, to represent them \u2013 and that speaks volumes. Powell would be turning in his grave. It\u2019s poetic justice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
