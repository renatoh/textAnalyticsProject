The central defender will end a two-month absence by starting at Fratton Park but cannot assume that he will be granted an extended run after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger spelled out on three occasions yesterday that Philippe Senderos is being rested. A fit Campbell was once an automatic choice but he has been kept in reserve when available recently and Wenger emphasised that reputation and the World Cup will not determine his selections. Campbell last played for Arsenal on February 1, when he left Highbury at half-time after a disastrous 45 minutes of the 3-1 defeat by West Ham, when the defender felt \"down\" and \"guilty\" for the first two goals, and disappeared to Belgium. Wenger feels the 31-year-old is now in good physical and mental condition. If Campbell's first challenge is to stay in the Arsenal team for the Champions League semi-final against Villarreal, he must also convince Eriksson to take him to Germany. He is held in high regard by the England manager but will need to show he has the form and fitness required for the World Cup. Campbell takes longer than some to reach his physical peak and has been troubled recently by ankle and toe injuries. Eriksson is not short of options in central defence. John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Ledley King and Jamie Carragher are all expected to go to the finals, with the last two also covering other positions, and Wes Brown was in the most recent squad. Jonathan Woodgate is all but out of contention after the latest in a lengthy line of injuries. King will hope a nagging groin problem does not worsen. \"Sol will start tomorrow because I will rest Senderos, who finished tired against Manchester United, so it gives him a good opportunity to show that he's ready for us and as well for you,\" Wenger said in reference to England. \"The challenge for him is to play well. It's quite simple.\" Campbell was kept out of last season's Cup final by Senderos and could find his involvement in the run-in restricted by the 21-year-old Switzerland international. Senderos has formed a sound partnership with Kolo Tour\u00e9 in Campbell's absence, and Wenger said he has not been dropped despite struggling in the second half at Old Trafford. \"I do not take Senderos out because I am not happy with him,\" he said. \"We have a big record in the Champions League and it's down to Senderos as well. I will make my decisions when I have to make them but all the three central defenders know it's down to them. \"I have no really preconceived ideas. I just can say that recently I have been very happy with the defence because we have done very, very well and the decision I take is to rest Senderos, like I rest some other players, not more than that. The first obvious man to come in for me is Sol Campbell. I'm happy we have Sol back. After that I will go from game to game.\" Wenger may use Campbell and Senderos together against West Bromwich on Saturday, giving Tour\u00e9 a rest. His selection for the match with Villarreal a week today will be telling, and Senderos would be entitled to feel hard done by if dropped. However, Campbell has been guaranteed matches by Wenger. \"We have now in 3\u00bd weeks, eight games,\" he said. \"Naturally he will get games.\" Wenger said he hopes Campbell will go to the World Cup and has assured Eriksson that Campbell and Ashley Cole will be \"ready and available\". Cole returns to full training on Monday and Wenger hopes the left-back will be in contention for the final four or five matches. \"For England it should not be a problem,\" he said. Cesc F\u00e1bregas misses tonight's game because of a foot injury but Thierry Henry starts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
