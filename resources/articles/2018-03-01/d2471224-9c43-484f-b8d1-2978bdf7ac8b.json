USA review \u2013 the one where Monica goes in search of her ancestors", "bodyText": "The one where Monica goes to England and finds she\u2019s related to the Queen. Or should be the Queen, maybe. Courteney Cox would take either. At home in California, she jokes: \u201cI hope I\u2019m from Buckingham Palace.\u201d Pronounced the American way: Bucking Ham Palace. She also hopes that her ancestors made a mark, though maybe not by murdering anyone. Let\u2019s see \u2026 Going up her mum\u2019s side there\u2019s a bit of light incest but nothing too serious, and she\u2019s related to a lot of people in Virginia. Never mind them, though, who was the first to come to the US? I don\u2019t think Courteney is Native American is she? No, here\u2019s Thomas Ligon (1623-1675), Courteney\u2019s great x nine grandfather, who came to Virginia from War Wickshire, England. She\u2019s one of us. So she\u2019s on a plane to the old country to meet Nick the genial genealogist, the first of several scholarly British chaps who spend their lives deep in dusty old records and are clearly rather excited to have Monica from Friends in the house. He rolls out some extra charm and attentiveness, helps with the Latin and a bit of gentle pronunciation correction: Berkeley (as in Central Park not Central Perk). That\u2019s a name in Courteney\u2019s family that gets Nick excited because it\u2019s an aristocratic name. Courteney\u2019s excited, too. \u201cWow, I like it,\u201d she says. Then it\u2019s off to the family pile, Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire \u2013 a proper one \u201cwith a moat and those little windows where you can kill people\u201d, Courteney confirms. It was built by Thomas de Berkeley, Courteney\u2019s great x 18 grandfather. From there it all goes a bit Danny Dyer, without question the greatest WDYTYA of all time. Thomas de Berkeley held Edward II prisoner here, in 1327. And a great x 19 grandfather of Courteney\u2019s, Roger Mortimer, was effectively ruling the country, as well as shagging the king\u2019s missus, Queen Isabella. Edward was killed, possibly suffocated, although one account has a hollow instrument thrust into his fundament. Youch. \u201cWhy not just suffocate him?\u201d asks Courteney. Where\u2019s the fun in that? Whodunnit? Almost certainly one of her rellies, possibly both. Later they would be tried in Westminster. Well \u201ctried\u201d; Roger was bound and gagged, so he couldn\u2019t say anything, his guilt already decided, then drawn and hanged. Thomas de B was acquitted, luckily, or Friends wouldn\u2019t have happened the way we know it and Cougar Town probably wouldn\u2019t have happened at all, not that the latter would matter much. Oh, and this other chap in this picture here, being put to a very unpleasant death, his privates chopped off and tossed into the fire? That\u2019s Hugh Despenser, another great x 18 grandfather, executed on the orders of Roger Mortimer. Cox hoped her ancestors made a mark, although maybe not by murdering anyone, remember? Well, they didn\u2019t just murder anyone, they murdered the king, and each other. Then they married each other and ran the country. I think it\u2019s safe to say they made a mark. \u201cYou think they make that stuff up in Game of Thrones but they really don\u2019t,\u201d says Courteney. \u201cWe were doing it right there with the old great grandparents.\u201d It might not attain Danny Dyer levels of hilarity, because Courteney Cox doesn\u2019t get so carried away with her meteoric rise through the strata of English society, but she is entertaining and amusing in a more understated way. \u201cThank you, Parliament,\u201d she says, on realising that Thomas de Berkeley\u2019s acquittal also clears her to exist. As Danny D found out, once you\u2019re in it\u2019s not hard to go higher still. Or once you\u2019ve found a genealogist who can get you into these kinds of levels of society, it\u2019s not hard to find another who can take you back a little further to get you to the top. That\u2019s where Courteney\u2019s headed. At the College of Arms she meets her great x 20 grandfather, Edward I. From there it\u2019s easy: great x 25 grandfather: Henry I. So her great x 26 grandfather is William the Bastard. You could point out that Courteney Cox has many great x 26 grandparents (268,435,456, I think, although of course some of them must be the same person, as that\u2019s roughly the population of the world in 1066). So one of them is bound to be if not William I then at least someone. Or, going the other way, he has a hell of a lot of direct descendants. But that would make you a spoilsport. This is the one where Monica goes to London and finds out she\u2019s William the Conquerer\u2019s great x 26 granddaughter. And the only downside is that it also means ... she\u2019s Danny Dyer\u2019s cousin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
