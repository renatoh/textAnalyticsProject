It's time to sit up straight and concentrate on some proper telly, with long words and everything. And it didn't get much properer last week than the first in the Channel 4 two-parter Soul Searching, an opportunity for jobbing philosophers, theologians, humanities profs, Oxbridge fellows and dons, psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists and the motivational speaker Anthony Robbins (not to mention the laboured visual metaphor of a small girl dancing around a grand-yet-derelict room) to provide a few snappy answers to one of the biggest, burningest questions of all time: 'Is there some inner essence that is the heart of what we are - a soul, a sanctuary within us that the world cannot reach?' I don't know about you, but I've definitely got a soul and I know exactly where it's located: not in my left brain or my right or my pineal gland but inside a sanctuary that anybody with a central London zone Tube pass (and now even Brummies, too) can easily reach: Selfridges. And that's the problem with a fine, grown-up, intelligently realised programme such as Soul Searching - there can never be enough jokes, even bad ones. Which was one of the reasons I jacked in a degree in philosophy and theology after it was pointed out that an essay about Cartesian duality didn't really need a big-laugh pay-off line. Still, at the time I was quite proud of: I think therefore I am What I am I am my own special creation So come take a look Give me the hook or the ovation It's my world That I want to have a little pride in My world And it's not a place I have to hide in Life's not worth a damn Till you can say I am what I am... For is not Gloria Gaynor's me-me-me generation gay disco anthem a pretty snappy answer to one of the show's searching questions: who needs a soul when you can have a self? And if you can have a self with soul , so much the better, no? But don't get me wrong. Me and my horrid, shallow, postmodern little self loved almost every minute of Soul Searching , even though it would have worked just as well on the wireless. Don't miss tonight's second and mightily ambitious final part which will attempt to define what a soul might be. Meanwhile, let's move on to Chaucer. Yes, come on you at the back with the ruler and the ink cartridge and the dog-eared copy of One Hundred Best Fart Jokes , pay attention. The first in BBC1's contemporary retellings of The Canterbury Tales took the most memorable bit of The Miller's Tale - the kiss-my-arse and red-hot-poker episodes - and wove around them a slim story of cons, karaoke, celebrity lust and carnality which featured Billie Piper, Jimmy Nesbitt (who played the respective arses as to the manner born) and Dennis Waterman. It was fun, flimsy, brightly scripted and had arguably more to say about the waning status of Gloria Gaynor than it did about the contemporary relevance of Chaucer - here was the only karaoke bar in the entire world where nobody had a crack at 'I Will Survive' every hour on the hour. The Cold Feet era Jimmy Nesbitt often brought me out in an allergic reaction but perhaps a lengthy absence from our screens is making my hard old heart grow fonder. The Miller's Tale was Nesbitt's show and he was terrifically watchable as the oleaginous conman, Nick, coming over all Simon Cowell in his pursuit of Billie Piper's karaoke queen, Alison, who, in turn, was keen to cuckold her husband, the jealous publican John (Waterman). Piper was good, too, but playing a character who gets to sing 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' while wearing Lycra wasn't too much of a stretch. The best thing to do with the rest of the Beeb's Canterbury Tales is to forget about Geoff - those who know and love their Chaucer might feel cheated by the fact that the BBC is so flagrantly unfaithful to the texts, while those who don't know their Pardoner from their Franklin might feel patronised, which is hardly the way to encourage an interest in fourteenth- century Eng lit. Anyway, back to the important stuff - I can state with some authority that Chaucer definitely had a soul, and here's why: And as for me, though that I konne but lyte On Bokes for to rede I me delyte, And to hem yive I feyth and ful credence And in myn herte have hem in reverence (Now try singing it to the tune of 'I Will Survive'. And after that, please make a recording. And then send it to me, being sure to include your full name, address and postcode. I won't ask for much, say a tenner a week, by direct debit.) Last week's ITV1 two-part drama was called Suspicion and starred Amanda Redman as a woman called Carol who lived in a big, cold, suburban-modern house with her husband of 19 years, a successful second-hand car dealer called Mark, played by Adrian Dunbar. One day, Carol received a nasty email from someone who called themselves the Truth Teller, advising her that Mark was having an affair with his secretary, Rebecca. At first, this seemed quite likely because both Mark and Rebecca appeared to be smooth-talking, shark-eyed replicants created by the same manufacturer, while Carol was a bit of a Squeeze-Me-and-I-Say-Mama-and-Cry-Real-Tears living doll. But by the end of episode one, when Rebecca lay dead on her sofa in a pool of blood, we knew it couldn't have been Carol wot dun her in, because she'd found the body, and it couldn't be Mark because only a really good writer could get away with making the obvious suspect actually guilty of the crime and Suspicion wasn't blessed with a really good writer. Which left the rest of the cast: Carol's devoted sister Julie (Saskia Reeves), who was married to moody Trevor, who was employed by Mark as a salesman. And young Stephen, who'd just been sacked from the dealership and obviously bore a big grudge. And Stephen's boyfriend, Gareth, who didn't have a motive at all. While any viewer wishing to give free rein to their own suspicions was soon running out of suspects because everybody else was a policeman. By the end, everybody was dead (not the police - they'd just mysteriously disappeared) except for Carol and Mark. Julie had turned out to be the Truth Teller, because she fancied both Mark and his house, while Trevor was both Rebecca's lover and her murderer and got to die in a very lazy deus ex machina car crash, largely because the screenplay had already driven itself into a dramatic cul-de-sac before writing itself off completely. Which, sadly, left us with the couple who had slightly less sexual chemistry between them than Morecambe and Wise, and whose emotional woodenness undermined the whole point of the drama, which was about trust. Redman did her level best, but watching her trying to coax a performance out of Dunbar - his one-and-a-half facial expressions not helped by having eyes like a pair of boarded-up windows - was about as instantly gratifying as applying for planning permission. There were three hours of Suspicion and it felt like at least four. Still, it could have been infinitely worse: Carol could have been played by Amanda Burton. I've thoroughly enjoyed Channel 4's The Games, if only to keep tabs on the unlikely yet rather touching developing friendship between James Hewitt and So Solid Crew's Harvey, who seem to have more in common than simply being a Daily Mail public enemy No 1. Here's Hewitt bigging-up the gangsta rapper: 'I get orn vay well with Harvey. He's a genuine, honest and caring person. One in a million, rilly.' And here's Harvey on Hewitt: 'He's a very nice guy and very genuine - if he says he's got no friends, well I'm his friend.' It's truly lovely and C4 should be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of an upcoming series called Harvey and Hewitt , in which James introduces his new best chum to polo at the Guards Club and Harv takes Hewie down the 'hood and shows him how to get ghetto fabulous. Unsuprisingly, against televisual competition as strong as this, the actual business of The Games - during which Sporty Spice ending up in hospital after being accidentally incapacitated during a judo bout by, of all people, Miss World and Lee Latchford-Evans attempted to show us that being a member of Steps needn't mean you haven't got soul - was something of a non-starter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
