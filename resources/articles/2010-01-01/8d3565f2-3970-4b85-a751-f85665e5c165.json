Egoyan's admirers must be hoping that it is better than this. It could hardly be worse. Adoration is a muddled and frankly dubious film featuring Egoyan's partner, Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian, in the leading role. She gives a bizarrely mannered, supercilious, Razzie-worthy performance as Sabine, a teacher of French and drama in a Canadian high school, who one day reads aloud to her pupils a news story about a terrorist who put his pregnant fiancee on a flight to Israel, along with a bomb planted, unbeknown to her, in her hand luggage: the device was found and the horror averted. She then privately encourages tightly wound student Simon (Devon Bostick) to re-imagine this story, and read it aloud to the class \"revealing\" his own father to be the unnamed terrorist, without disclosing this to be fiction. Simon responds strongly to the experiment: his dangerous class-project fantasy, perhaps intended to help him sympathise with the terrorists' unacknowledged humanity, is dramatised as if for real in hazy flashback sequences. It gets out of hand, spreading through the internet like wildfire \u2013 apparently no one checks the facts with Google \u2013 and in webcam iChat sessions, we see various hysterical Jewish-Americans who were on the near-miss flight raging anew, as if the planned disaster had actually happened. Sabine goes to see Simon at home, and blithely remarks, a propos the Christmas decorations, that the Jews killed Christ; on a later visit, by way of ostensible apology, she states that the problem was not the \"Jews and Christ\" \u2013 she does not actually withdraw that claim \u2013 but the \"Zionists\". The uncle (and guardian) is splutteringly derisive on both occasions, but neither statement is investigated as such. Perhaps Sabine believes the Zionists killed Christ. Sabine's transgressive class-project gets her the sack: an event that leaves her serenely untroubled, and the final revelation appears to leave her as eccentrically placid as ever. Sabine, however flawed and headstrong, is clearly supposed to be on the side of the angels. Is Egoyan, somewhere on those various levels of reality, memory and myth, suggesting an equivalence of victimhood? If so, it is a pretty fatuous equivalence, made much more implausible by the clotted structure, some wince-makingly unconvincing scenes and truly terrible acting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
