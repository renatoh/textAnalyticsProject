The upcoming inquest into Ralph\u2019s near-shooting (an event he describes as \u201ca watershed moment\u201d, like it was those two girls kissing on Brookside) forms the spine of the story. Ralph, who has something to hide, attempts to influence Aafrin\u2019s testimony by offering him a new job as head clerk. I dunno; head clerk sounds as exciting as second washer-up, but, contextually, it\u2019s a life-changing promotion. Elsewhere, and outside at last, Cynthia is \u201crecreating afternoon tea at Claridge\u2019s in the Himalayas\u201d. She\u2019s preparing cucumber sarnies for the Sipi Fair, which I am going to file, alongside her milk punch, in the \u2018what the hell is that?\u2019 folder. Like Ralph, she\u2019s trying to pervert justice, which, apart from sandwiches, is what she\u2019s really good at. She approaches Alice and child, her \u2018you OK, hun?\u2019 solicitousness concealing a killer sting. Lightly juxtaposing the inquest and Alice\u2019s fragile social standing, she remarks: \u201cIn your position, I wouldn\u2019t remember a thing.\u201d On the revolutionary front, Aafrin\u2019s firebrand sister Sunni attends an Indian independence protest that is violently put down by the police, who beat men and women alike with clubs. She is arrested and degraded, forced to urinate in the corner of her cell. Frankly, things don\u2019t look good for her. Nothing really looks good for anyone. Dougie finally kisses Leena, next to some washing-up in the school, possibly to get her to stop babbling about cups. Because he\u2019s a good(ish) man, he immediately goes to find his wife and confess. \u201cYou look queer. You\u2019re acting queer,\u201d Sarah tells him, heedless of the rule that actors should never give each other notes. He confesses his \u201cun-Christian\u201d behaviour and she breaks down. We know how she turns heartbreak into scattergun beastliness, so this is a terrible development for everyone. At night, Sita and Aafrin meet in a graveyard that cinematographically resembles Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller video. They meet here to hide their affair, although Sita is quite weird, so it\u2019s possible she just hangs out there anyway. Aafrin tells her his new job makes him a \u201ccovenanted civilian\u201d, which sounds like he\u2019s about to be buried alive, but, like the head clerk thing, is actually good. It means he\u2019s free to choose any romantic future he chooses. I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up, though, Sita. The next day, Ralph and Aafrin continue to work on their Handsome Boys Club, meeting at Ralph\u2019s for drinks. Aafrin requests clemency for Sunni. Ralph acquiesces and, with his new colleague now indebted to him, casually suggests a shared story around the shooting \u2013 that assassin Chandru Mohan\u2019s final words were the politically inflected \u201cYou British devil.\u201d Which they weren\u2019t. Ralph could have been Algerian-Finnish for all it mattered to Mohan. Poor Madeleine hasn\u2019t even been in a subplot for the last two weeks. She\u2019s mainly there for slatternly seasoning, spicing up episodes by climbing into bath tubs with Ralph or bonking him noisily under brother Eugene\u2019s nose. (Eugene only wants peace, to wear his braces and read his book.) Olivia Grant\u2019s warm, free-spiritedness breathes life into her every scene, so it\u2019s a shame she\u2019s only being used for the sexy stuff at the moment. It looks like Ralph\u2019s only using her for the sexy stuff too, so maybe it\u2019s a clever form-following-content thing. Sipi fair time! Turns out Sipi fair is an intercultural fete, where Indians (excluded from the Royal Club) and the Brit-pack can awkwardly mingle, and at which Cynthia hilariously has the Indian musicians silenced because they\u2019re annoying her. \u201cMake yourself at home!\u201d she trills to the assembled crowd, before less disingenuously instructing her chief servant: \u201cNo access to the interior. And if anyone tramples the flowers, they\u2019re straight out.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty nice fair. There\u2019s a guess-the-weight-of-a-massive-cake-that-looks-like-a-boob-competition (5lb, 11oz) and male wrestling. Aafrin presents Alice with a large grasshopper made of leaves impaled on a stick. Having a less good time is proud, self-posessed Ramu Sood, \u201cthe Native\u201d who presents plantation owner Mr Armitage with an eviction notice, which is, er, bold. An apoplectic \u2013 and very Scottish \u2013 Armitage pushes him to the ground and throttles him. Unfortunately, the fat drunkard is no Captain America, and suffers a heart attack from the exertion. Judging by the way Cynthia is glaring at him, Ramu is going to take the blame for whatever happens. All the fun of the unfair. Indian Summers\u2019 energy was always going to come from agitation beyond the garden gates \u2013 and there are signs the simmering unrest is approaching a healthy roil. Aafrin and Alice perjure themselves at the inquest, corroborating the attempted murder as politically motivated. When Aafrin visits Sunni in jail, she is dismayed by his new job and status. \u201cMarvellous Mr Dalal, loyal servant. Look at the role they\u2019re casting you in.\u201d Through Sunni, he learns gunman Chandru\u2019s links to the Congress party were falsified; that his own shooting is being manipulated for British propaganda, that he has made a bed for the devil and crawled in beside him. Let\u2019s hope the show picks up momentum along with the revolutionary cause it\u2019s following, because there\u2019s juice there. Sunni is free for now \u2013 but at what price? Most Fate-Tempting Dialogue Upwardly-mobile Aafrin tells his delighted parents his job news, taking leave with the line, \u201cI have to go now. New life begins this afternoon.\u201d Have you never heard of jinxing things, man? Do you want to get shot again, probably in the face this time? Weirdest Job Prep/Equestrian Interlude After becoming head clerk, Aafrin is, for some reason, submitted to multiple rounds of dressage training, at which he is bad and looks silly. \u201cWhat kind of fool gets vertigo on a horse?\u201d asks a fellow clerk as Aafrin struggles with a five-bar gate. More Ludicrously Revealing Names Have we all fully appreciated that Cynthia Coffin has a trusted right-hand man whose name is Kaiser? KAISER. Is her favourite food devilled eggs? Does she have a budgerigar named Genghis? Does she put cats in bins? Most Titanic Moment Ralph, encouraging \u201cbest buddy\u201d Aafrin\u2019s artistic instincts, has Madeleine spread herself over a chaise and sets up an easel. He doesn\u2019t exactly instruct him to \u201cpaint her like one of your French girls\u201d, but it\u2019s still a strange moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
