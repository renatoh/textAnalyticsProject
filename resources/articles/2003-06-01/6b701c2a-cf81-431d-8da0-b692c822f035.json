By a nice irony, the opposite page had the most blatant example of journalistic plagiarism for some time. In later editions, the Indie lifted a photograph of the typewritten 1994 Brown-Blair agreement from the Guardian's early edition and slapped it in uncredited. This is the second time in three weeks that the paper has been caught filching material out of the Guardian: on May 20, the Indie's foreign editor made a grovelling apology after his \"inexperienced\" night-desk jackdaws copied out a report, scarcely bothering to change it. At the New York Times the staff eventually rose up in protest over the paper's sleazy behaviour; let us hope there is no such revolution at the Independent. \u00b7 Towers Perrin, the consultancy firm, are relaunching their press office with ambitious promises: to give replies to all inquiries within the hour, put journalists in touch with the most senior consultants available, and \"endeavour to ensure that consultants are available to assist journalists in the early stages of their research, regardless of whether it will result in coverage\". Most admirable, chaps. Channel 4 is apparently considering a similar manifesto - \"We promise to check our voicemails every now and again.\" And the name of Towers Perrin's chief press officer? Tamara Cutting. \u00b7 Job offers for the latest Big Brother contestants are rolling in already. Lucky Nush is being lined up to star in a new half-hour yoga series being made by, er, Playboy TV. Her assignment, we are told, would involve \"demonstrating Tantric yoga exercises which can improve sexual performance and stamina\". Playboy ask if we can also give their own reality show a plug. It's called Double Entry - Making It Big. Oh brother. \u00b7 Rumours that Stateside media giant Clear Channel may be too bogged down with consolidation in its own market to bother snapping up UK radio stations could be wide of the mark. We say this after catching sight of the radio behemoth's new HQ in Cluny Mews, London SW5, complete with massive poster site and company livery bannered over the top. Talk about a statement of intent... \u00b7 In our latest extract from Will Wyatt's autobiography, The Fun Factory (you won't read it anywhere else!), we are delighted to bring you this anecdote about Lord Hussey. Our Will remembers how Dukie had his speeches typed on little pieces of card. At a dinner in Bradford there was an unfortunate incident when, unseen by Hussey, a discarded card landed in the gap between the Lord Mayor's spectacles and his cheek. How the days must have flown by."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
