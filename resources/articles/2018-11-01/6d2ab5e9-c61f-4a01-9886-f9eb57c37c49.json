Ramon Abila put Boca ahead after 34 minutes before Lucas Pratto equalised for the visitors less than two minutes later. Dario Benedetto put Boca ahead again just seconds before halftime but Carlos Izquierdoz put through his own goal after 61 minutes to leave the tie all square. The second leg of the final, South America\u2019s equivalent of the Champions League, will take place at River\u2019s Monumental stadium on Nov. 24. \u201cIt was the game that everyone expected, tough with lots of fight,\u201d said River Plate defender Javier Pinola. \u201cSmall details could have led to a win but we fought hard and a draw was the fair result.\u201d The match was an end-to-end affair worthy of the occasion, the first time Argentina\u2019s two biggest clubs have met in the Libertadores final. With away fans banned from derby games in Argentina because of violence, Boca, who won the last of their six titles in 2007, played the first leg in front of their own fans in a sold out Bombonera stadium. River were also hindered by the absence of their coach Marcelo Gallardo from the stadium, who was banned for disobeying a suspension during the semi-final win over holders Gremio. Anyway ... thanks for joining me. It was a pretty exciting game with a stunning atmosphere and the results was the right one, in my opinion. Until we meet again. Here\u2019s the second River goal ... It was a pretty intense game with neither side wanting to give an inch. The pitch played its part in the first-half, meaning the quality was not always high but there were some great individual moments. In the end it was a very fair result and, more importantly, it means the second leg is evenly poised. 90+3 min: A final free-kick is chucked into the box by Boca but River take control and clear the ball with ease. 90+1 min: Boca\u2019s Perez goes down with cramp and he is certainly not alone in being tired here. 90 min: Armani shows why he is a hero with his biggest moment of the match. Tevez broke through into the box and sent a pass to the unmarked Benedetto but Armani came out at him quickly and blocked the shot. That could be a crucial moment in this tie. Five minutes added on. 87 min: A long ball into the box is dealt with by Armani who came to claim the cross above Abila but it took the goalkeeper two attempts to gain control of the ball. Rossi has definitely been the more secure goalkeeper today. 85 min: Great stuff from Buffarini who comes on and dives in two-footed but gets away with it just seconds after coming onto the pitch. The Boca fans are lifting the volume once again. 83 min: The heavy pitch has taken its toll on a few players today and Jara does not look able to continue due to the long-term impact of running around on this wet turf for 82 minutes. He is stretchered off and Buffarini is heading on. 81 min: Pratto runs across the Boca defenders to get onto the end of a cross from the left but he can only glance his shot with the outside of his foot and it trickles wide. Lovely movement but he needed a more substantial touch. 79 min: Abila sent a backheel into the path of Tevez who then smashed a shot towards the net but it flies high and wide. He is looking pretty lively, though. Abila does not offer the dynamism that Tevez does. Although, it should be said he has done a great job today. 77 min: Turns out Borre was booked and it he will now miss the second leg. Pity Martinez comes off and Juan Quintero is on. Exciting times. 75 min: Tevez has made an impact by being taken down. And another former City man is on, with Zuculini replacing Perez. Borre tries to make things worse for himself after complaining to the referee about something or other. He threw his fist in the air in frustration but the referee is calm and leaves it at a quick chat. 73 min: My prayers have been answered and now Tevez is on to terrify the River defence. He looks like he is up for it. 71 min: Jara chucks a long throw into the box for the Boca players to attack but it is easily cleared. Can we have Tevez on please? 69 min: Boca are keen to get speedy Villa on the ball and rightly so. He has looked frightening in full flow, even if he is yet to produce much in the final third. 67 min: Casco is the latest man to go into the box have going through the back of Nandez. A cynical foul and a deserved booking. 65 min: A loose cross from River is then followed up by a wayward through ball from Boca. The pitch is looking better now and the ball rolling truer, so hopefully the teams can make the most of it. 63 min: Palacios smashes a shot from a very long way out but it goes nowhere near the net. Can no one defend the long straight ball in Argentina? A deep free-kick into the box flicks off Izquierdoz\u2019s head and it bounces into the corner beyond the helpless Rossi. Pratto tried to claim it but it did not touch him. 60 min: Another straight ball into the box causes problems for River as Izquierdoz outmuscles Pinola but he can\u2019t make good enough contact on the ball and it goes just wide. 58 min: River do make a change as Quarta departs the field of play, to be replaced by Fernandez. Casco sprints onto a loose ball 30 yards from goal, he hit it extremely well but it flashed just wide. 56 min: River have their first attack of the second-half. They work it down to the edge of the box where indecision allows Boca to regroup and block a shot, which fell to Pratto in an offside position. 53 min: Maybe River Plate will need to make a change to turn things around. It worked for Boca Juniors, even if it was forced, but a change in personnel made a difference for them. 51 min: Boca certainly on top on the early exchanges here and they will want to make the most of the home advantage going into the second leg. 49 min: No penalty! Abila appeals for a spot-kick but he looks like he has just chucked himself the ground after feeling Pinola\u2019s breath on his neck. Then the striker complains to the referee who wafts his yellow card around. Villa then goes down on the edge of the box but nothing is given once again. 47 min: Can the fans keep it up for another 45 minutes? They sound like they will be shouting for the rest of the game. Nothing to report in opening stages of the second period. Here we go again! The pitch is not helping anyone in Buenos Aires but the players seemed to get used to it later on in that half, so hopefully that will mean a more fluid second half. It might even have caused Pavon\u2019s hamstring injury. Here are the goals for you to enjoy ... Well ... this game has swung both ways here. The Boca fans are absolutely loving it and are going mad out there. Everything has happened in the space of 12 minutes are a quiet half hour as both sides got used to the condition. Boca have taken their best chances while Rossi has been in great form for the hosts. More of the same please. The substitute has made his mark! A free-kick from Villa straight down the middle lands on Benedetto\u2019s head and he flicks it beyond Armani to instigate euphoria in the stands. 45 min: Three minutes added on here. 44 min: A huge wasp has just attacked the camera. Speaking of players being stung, Montiel has just chucked himself to the floor after going up against Villa while waiting for a throw-in. The River man got his opponent booked, so it worked in the end. 42 min: River are the better team here, it\u2019s just a shame that Boca Juniors have the far superior goalkeeper. If Armani and Rossi swapped it could be 5-0 to River. 40 min: Rossi once again repels River Plate. This time he uses his legs to block a a fiercely struck shot from Martinez. Borr\u00e9 breaks free and gets the other side of the defence but when one-on-one with the goalkeeper he hit his shot with the outside of his foot, resulting in the ball going well wide. 38 min: Jara goes into the book for taking down Martinez in a crude fashion. This is getting pretty tasty now. Fans and players alike are really going for it. That did not take long at all. The ball was played into the channel for Pratto who took control of it and ran into the box from where he sent a shot across Rossi into the bottom corner. Ooof. Boca were still celebrating when that went in. At the second attempt Abila gives Boca Juniors the lead and turns La Bombonera into a wall of noise. The forward sent one shot straight at Armani; the first was palmed straight back to him and he hit the second through his weak hands. Woeful goalkeeping, really. 32 min: Not much quality in the last few minutes to be honest. Looks like it is a touch bitty in Buenos Aires. Pavon was not happy ... 30 min: Boca work it wide but River are quite happy heading away the floated crosses. The hosts might need a Plan B. 28 min: A bit of a break in play for the Pavon substitution, meaning nothing happened. Pavon is still walking around the pitch to get to the dressing room. 26 min: Now the Boca fans are chucking everything can get their hands on at Martinez as he tries to take a corner. He looked like a stick was the item which made it over the barrier and through the netting. Pavon is walking off after putting in a dangerous cross. He is not happy, he is pounding the floor and will be replaced by Benedetto. 24 min: The first set of handbags. Barrios kicking out at Casco resulted in a lot of pushing and shoving. The fans enjoyed it and the referee calmed everything down, so everyone is happy. 22 min: Pavon\u2019s hamstring has gone. That could be the end of him, which would be gutting for all Boca fans, players and staff. He is now down and being treated.Could be it for him now. 20 min: Montiel has put in a couple of great crosses form the right and sooner or later a River Plate forward will get on the end of one of those. The home crowd is getting pretty nervous as River dominate. 18 min: The pitch might work against River here who are playing the better football but it is really holding up on the sodden grass. Boca Juniors 0-0 River Plate 16 min: Another great save from Rossi after a deep cross from swung from the left onto Borr\u00e9\u2019s head but his glancing effort was palmed wide by the Boca goalkeeper. 14 min: Villa tries to be clever by sending a no-look pass out to the left but the supposed recipient did not know it was coming and it went straight out for a goal kick. Not great. Abila looked like he had broken through the defence but he handballed it when his cross was sent straight back at him. 12 min: Pavon decides to try his luck from 25 yards but his shot goes a long way over the bar and into the netting behind the goal. 10 min: River certainly look the more composed side here and are warming to the occasion, whereas Boca might be a touch worried about letting down their raucous home support. 8 min: Boca send long balls up towards Abila on two separate occasions for the striker to chase but it runs to the \u2018keeper each time. This could be a regular tactic as the ball is being held up by the sodden pitch. 6 min: The aforementioned free-kick is swung towards the top corner from Martinez but Rossi saw where it was going and tipped it wide. The corner was sent onto the edge of the 18-yard box but Quarta sent his header a couple of yards wide despite being unmarked. 4 min: River have finally got a hold of the ball which has quietened the home fans. They have even earned a free-kick in a dangerous position just outside the box. 2 min: Some early pressure from Boca in the opening minutes as they get two corners within the opening 60 seconds. The referee looks like he might be set for a tricky day and has already spoken to a few players about getting too close in the box. The pitch looks a little damp, which is no surprise after all the rain. Peep! Peep! Here we go with a roar! BT Sport are here! The clouds look a bit grey but there is no lack of blue and yellow around the ground. Remember there are no away fans there so it will be very spicy for the River players. The atmosphere is building ... The pace of Villa and delivery from Pavon will be crucial for Boca tonight if they are to use their home advantage. The two widemen are an exciting prospect for their fans and will be looking to show that they can do tonight. River Plate have done their warmup in a school gym, like Manchester City used to in the late 1990s. From the other side of the divide ... I\u2019ll be honest, there are a lot of stunning photos coming in from La Bombonera. I might just see if I can tell the story of the game via images. Also, it might have been a good idea for BT Sport to show some of the buildup, to be honest. That\u2019s what we\u2019re mainly here for, right? It looks busy in the stands ... It must be great to be there. Our man Jonathan Wilson knows a thing or two about Argentine football, so we asked to write about how ruddy bloody huge this match is ... Along with Tevez there is another Manchester City player who will be heating the bench today. River Plate\u2019s Bruno Zuculini inexplicably spent three seasons on the books at the Etihad, resulting in zero appearances in the league but he did play once in the Community Shield. He did have six separate loan spells, including five games for Middlesbrough for no obvious reason. Here is the rivalry in video form ... So ... Tevez and Quintero are on the bench today, which is a shame as I can talk about them for a while. Also gutted that Mauro Zarate isn\u2019t starting, either. Boca Juniors: Rossi, Jara, Magall\u00e1n, Izquierdoz, Olaza, P.P\u00e9rez, Barrios, N\u00e1ndez, Pav\u00f3n, \u00c1bila, Villa Subs: Lampe, Goltz, Buffarini, Gago, Benedetto, Z\u00e1rate, Tevez. River Plate: Armani; Montiel, Maidana, Mart\u00ednez Quarta, Pinola, Casco; Palacios, Enzo P\u00e9rez, Pity Mart\u00ednez; Borr\u00e9, Pratto Subs: Lux, Mayada, Zuculini, Fern\u00e1ndez, Quintero, Mora, \u00c1lvarez. Just in case you are wondering why this game was not played yesterday ... it was a touch wet in Buenos Aires. \u00a1Buenas tardes! Finally! After 58 years - and a day of rain - we are finally about to see the first Supercl\u00e1sico Copa Libertadores final as Argentina\u2019s greatest rivalry takes centre stage in world football. The anticipation was great enough yesterday so the fact we had had a 24-hour delay just makes it a little bit more exciting and potentially a touch tenser than we all thought. For some the atmosphere will be enough to make the occasion memorable but there is certainly going to be some great action on the pitch. There is no shortage of quality in either side, hence why they are playing in South America\u2019s biggest match. Carlos Tevez is the man leading the line for Boca Juniors, the perfect man mix of skill and fight to ensure it will be a spectacle, even if the pitch is a little bit wetter than we all hoped for. River boast Juan Quintero, a man who showed his ability in the World Cup, while 20-year-old Exequiel Palacios is an exciting prospect who has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid. Bring it on! Will will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Robbie Blakeley on how we got here: \u201cLook mate, you\u2019re going to need to sit in the front. If you sit back there it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m an Uber car and some taxi drivers could kick the shit out of me. It happened to someone I know about a week ago.\u201d Such an overwrought arrival at EZE airport on 23 October was a strangely fitting prelude to two big, dramatic days of football in Buenos Aires. The semi-final draw for the Copa Libertadores \u2013 South America\u2019s answer to the Champions League \u2013 had thrown up two huge games featuring four mammoth clubs and the tension was palpable across the city. The rivalry between South America\u2019s two greatest football nations is well established, thanks in no small part to their success in the Copa Libertadores. Argentinian clubs have won the competition 24 times, with Brazilian sides further back on 18, and they were about to go head-to-head in the semi-finals.
