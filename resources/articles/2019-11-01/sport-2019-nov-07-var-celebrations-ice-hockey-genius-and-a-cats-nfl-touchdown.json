The visitors, Longlevens, had been 2-0 up going into second-half stoppage time. Falmouth eventually won 3-2 after extra-time. 2) Nicola Adams announced her retirement this week. The Yorkshire fighter was as popular a figure as British boxing has produced in recent years, so let\u2019s reminds ourselves why: Here\u2019s her London 2012 gold medal bout against China\u2019s Ren Cancan in all its glory, and her reaction to it. Four years later in Rio, she did it again. Here\u2019s the full fight from her last bout as a pro, against Maria Salinas in September. 3) We\u2019re used to cats invading the pitch in English football grounds, wedged as they often are between rows of terraced houses, but less common is the sight of a moggy doing a lengthy run into the end zone at an NFL match. So, here\u2019s to this furry feline entertaining the crowd at the Cowboys-Giants game! Golf\u2019s always good for animal intruders, too. Here\u2019s a top 10 for you. 4) Congratulations to England\u2019s Emily Scarrat on being crowned women\u2019s world rugby union player of the year last weekend. This is why she won, and here she is telling her story, and having a more trivial quickfire chinwag with James Haskell. 5) Yaya Tour\u00e9 gets sent off after only 10 seconds for kicking an opponent up the backside in a match for Qingdao Huanghai against Nantong Zhiyun in China. It\u2019s certainly a good way to get out of 89 minutes and 50 seconds\u2019 worth of running. 6) Andrei Svechnikov is the first NHL player in history to score the \u201cMichigan\u201d goal. It\u2019s quite something. Can\u2019t score from here, can he? We have more ice-hockey genius here, too, courtesy of Matthew Tkachuk. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) James Ellison\u2019s best save ever in British Superbikes. 2) Randy Mamola - great name, great rider, balls of steel.
