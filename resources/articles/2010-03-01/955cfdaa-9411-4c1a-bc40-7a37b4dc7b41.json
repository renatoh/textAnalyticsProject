Cook led England to a 2-0 Test series victory, scored Test hundreds in both Chittagong and Dhaka, and also advanced his reputation as a batsman in 50-overs cricket during a 3-0 win in the ODI series. He was repeatedly told that England should win every game and they did just that. Flower proclaimed England's decision to rest Strauss and give Cook his first taste of international leadership a success, saying: \"I think the opportunity that was taken to expose him to that sort of experience was very valuable. He's grown every day. He's feeling a lot more comfortable about leading. He is leading with a bat in his hand, in very attacking fashion. And he's made some really good decisions out in the field. All in all, I think he's done brilliantly.\" That strongly indicates that Cook remains favourite to understudy Strauss in Australia next winter. That Kevin Pietersen possesses more tactical acumen seems incontestable on the evidence of Bangladesh, but Flower seems in no rush to return to the possibility of a Pietersen captaincy after the way his first spell imploded as he pressed for the sacking of his coach Peter Moores, causing both men to lose their jobs. Cook had his uncomfortable spells in the field, especially in Dhaka. Tamim Iqbal would have run most fielding plans ragged on the opening morning, but Bangladesh's late-order flourish 24 hours later left him increasingly confused and exposed his naivety as a leader. His team-mates have been protective of him throughout, which is testimony to his popularity. Cook was honest enough to accept his limitations. \"There are a lot of things for me to work on as a leader,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed the challenge and it's been hard work at stages. It's going to help me develop as a person and as a captain. \"I now know how I need to get better as a captain, especially in terms of my leadership in the dressing room. I know I lacked experience in certain situations. It is one of the things I need to work out when I get back and get better at. Captaincy has been a massive eye-opener. \"We knew Bangladesh had some talented players. What surprised us was how flat the pitches were. It limited what you could do as a captain. If you changed lots of things, and tried to force it, it shifted the balance back to the batsman. Doing the simple things well seemed to be the art of good captaincy on those wickets.\" Cook now heads back home, initially to help out with the end of the lambing season at his girlfriend's family farm, and will take at least a month off. He will play no part in England's 15-strong squad for World Twenty20 in the Caribbean, which will be announced next Tuesday. The tournament starts on 30 April. Bangladesh and Pakistan visit England this summer, but already attention is straying towards the Ashes series in Australia next winter. It is tempting to make excessive claims for the long-term impact of a successful tour and Cook needed no second invitation to suggest that England's hard-won success in Bangladesh, the weakest Test nation, will benefit them in Australia. \"I think it's done us a world of good,\" he said. \"We've had to work for results in hard conditions in terms of the heat and flat wickets. Bowling on the subcontinent will be different to bowling in Australia, but it can only bode well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
