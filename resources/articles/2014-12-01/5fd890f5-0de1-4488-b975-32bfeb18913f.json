Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The Senate intelligence committee released hundreds of pages of a report on secret CIA torture practices conducted over seven years at hidden sites around the world after the 9/11 attacks. The CIA and White House had tried to block some or all of the report. The report contained a substantial amount of never-before-revealed information about the Bush-era torture program, including the number of CIA detainees (119), certain techniques (rectal feeding and hydration) and new details in cases of specific detainees. Key findings of the report, as presented by intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (video), included that \u201cthe CIA\u2019s \u2018enhanced interrogation techniques\u2019 were not effective\u201d and \u201cthe CIA\u2019s management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed\u201d. The report also found that the CIA had misled Congress, the Bush administration and the public in testimony and classified meetings to talk about the program. The UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism called for a criminal prosecution, saying, \u201cThe individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today\u2019s report must be brought to justice.\u201d US president Barack Obama said in a statement that the report \u201cdocuments a troubling program\u201d that \u201cdid significant damage to America\u2019s standing in the world\u201d. CIA director John Brennan released a statement rebutting the report and saying the practices \u201cdid produce intelligence that helped ... save lives\u201d. Read our latest news story on the Senate report, \u201cShocking cases in CIA report reveal an American torture program in disarray.\u201d Here\u2019s a section, by Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman): By October 2004, Gul\u2019s accuser recanted. It is unclear if that accuser gave up Gul in the first place after he was himself tortured. The CIA transferred Gul to an unknown foreign partner, and he was ultimately freed. As Gul\u2019s previously unknown case indicates, years of leaks and occasional official disclosures about the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 torture efforts did not reveal a program as brutal, unaccountable and even chaotic as the one portrayed by the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday. The committee\u2019s report portrays a feedback loop: the CIA embraced torture, then failed to question and review its value. \u201cHaving initially cited Gul\u2019s knowledge of the pre-election threat, as reported by the CIA\u2019s source, the CIA began representing that its enhanced interrogation techniques were required for Gul to deny the existence of the threat, thereby disproving the credibility of the CIA source,\u201d the report found. Read the full piece here. And here\u2019s a link to a Guardian editorial on the release of the report: If you prefer to take your news aurally, this is an informative WBEZ news spot, with commentary by Katherine Hawkins, a national security fellow at @openthegov: The Senate didn\u2019t get to look at everything. The White House invoked executive privilege to block staffers from seeing thousands of documents potentially related to torture, the report says: Here\u2019s a key to the color code in the Senate report, via the Washington Post: The CIA gave inaccurate information to journalists in order to mislead the public about the efficacy of its interrogation program, the Senate report reveals. The report also details how the CIA competed with the FBI over how much credit each agency would receive in the media for their achievements, real or imagined, the Guardian\u2019s Nicky Woolf (@nickywoolf) reports: \u201cIn seeking to shape press reporting \u2026 CIA officers and the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs (OPA) provided unattributed background information on the program to journalists for books, articles and broadcasts, including when the existence of the CIA\u2019s Detention and Interrogation Program was still classified,\u201d the report said. [...] Many of the inaccuracies the CIA fed to journalists, the report says, were consistent with inaccurate information being provided by the agency to policymakers at the time. The deputy director of the CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism center explained to a colleague, according to the report, that \u201cwhen the Washington Post or the New York Times quotes a \u2018senior intelligence official\u2019, it\u2019s us.\u201d Read the full piece here. We asked the experts \u2013 terrorism prosecutors, former spies, doctors and human rights lawyers \u2013 to comb through hundreds of pages and expose the new truths that matter most to history: Here\u2019s some of what they highlighted: A prosecutor\u2019s Eureka moment: I never got specifics because they didn\u2019t exist Human rights violations, rewarded with CIA cash Doctors were used to create a fiction of safe, legal and effective Anal probes as punishment for hunger-striking? So how is force-feeding not torture now? Read the full piece here. Video: CIA interrogation techniques were not effective. Here\u2019s further footage of Dianne Feinstein\u2019s address this morning on the Senate floor: [The report] finds that coercive interrogation techniques did not produce the vital otherwise unavailable intelligence the CIA has claimed\u201d: More graphic detail from the report on the torture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: The Senate report poses a challenge for Europe to come clean about its own complicity in CIA-managed torture, Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de writes in Comment Is Free: As the world awaited the US Senate report on the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation programme under the George W Bush administration, there was very little introspection in Europe. As if European countries had nothing to do with what went on in the hunt for al-Qaida in the years after 9/11. In fact, many of America\u2019s European allies were deeply involved in the CIA programme. And they have managed to stay very quiet about it. Could this change now? Under President Bush the CIA used a web of European airports and bases for its extraordinary rendition flights, secretly transferring terror suspects across borders for interrogation. Some European states helped the CIA to carry out kidnappings. Others hosted CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d \u2013 in effect, torture chambers \u2013 on their territory. The 600-page redacted summary of the 6,000-page report, published on Tuesday by the Senate intelligence committee, will no doubt be scrutinised to see what it may reveal of the continent\u2019s involvement in these abuses. In 2007 a special investigator for the Council of Europe, Dick Marty, concluded that there was \u201cenough evidence to state\u201d that American secret prisons existed in Poland and Romania. He added that the \u201cillegal deportation of suspects by CIA kidnapping teams in Europe\u201d amounted to \u201ca massive and systematic violation of human rights\u201d. Read the full piece here. Things Michael Hayden says in public don\u2019t seem to age well. A web site rebutting the Senate report went live today at the URL ciasavedlives.com. The site doesn\u2019t identify its authors except to say \u201cThis website was created by a group of former CIA officials with hundreds of years of combined service. They all have first-hand knowledge that the CIA\u2019s interrogation program was authorized, legal and effective. They also have in common that during its 5+ year investigation, the SSCI did not bother to contact them and seek their views.\u201d The web site offers a timeline purporting to show how the legal framework for the law evolved. It links to documents puporting to show that torture was effective, including books by former CIA director George Tenet and former CIA counter-terrorism chief Jose Rodriguez. The site also repeatedly asks why Senate staffers did not seek to interview CIA officials about the program: We, as former senior officers of the Central Intelligence Agency, created this website to present documents that conclusively demonstrate that the program was: authorized by the President, overseen by the National Security Council, and deemed legal by the Attorney General of the United States on multiple occasions. None of those officials were interviewed either. None. CIA relied on their policy and legal judgments. We deceived no one. You will not find this truth in the Majority Report. The CIA extracted false information about terrorist plots against Heathrow airport and London\u2019s Canary Wharf business district from al-Qaida mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and then used it to justify its use of waterboarding, the US Senate intelligence committee report on the CIA\u2019s use of torture concluded. The Guardian\u2019s Ian Cobain (@iancobain) and Richard Norton-Taylor (@nortontaylor) report: While a different prisoner said there had been a fledgling plan to attack each of the London targets, this had not been developed because those responsible had been apprehended, the report says. Despite this, Mohammed began to deliver up elaborate details of the plots once his interrogators began to subject him to waterboarding, according to the committee\u2019s examination of secret CIA files. The agency then decided to increase the number of times that Mohammed was subjected to the torture technique in order to induce him to confess to supposed plots within the US. The CIA then began to highlight the \u201cintelligence\u201d about the London attacks to argue that waterboarding had not only proved invaluable, but must be allowed to continue. [...] Once the waterboarding ceased, Mohammed felt able to admit that the details he had provided about the plots against London had been false. Read the full piece here. The Guardian\u2019s Remi Adekoya (@remiadekoya1) reports from Warsaw: Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz has said that \u201cirrespective\u201d of what is in the freshly-released US Senate report on the CIA, \u201cit will not harm US-Polish relations.\u201d Kopacz made the comments to journalists at the Visegrad summit in Bratislava, Slovakia, after the release of the report today. The Polish PM said she had shared her position with US President Barack Obama in a phone call yesterday. The two leaders were said to have spoken at the request of Mr Obama. Polish deputy PM and defense minister Tomasz Siemoniak, who was present during the call, said the Polish prime minister and the US president had agreed that the publication of the report \u201cwould in no way affect US-Polish relations negatively.\u201d Poland is one of the countries that has been accused of hosting so-called CIA black sites but the Polish government has never openly admitted the fact. Prosecutors in Poland are in the process of conducting an investigation into the alleged CIA facilities in the country but appear stuck in preliminary proceedings. Kopacz said the Polish prosecutors would now decide \u201chow useful\u201d the released US report is to their work. She added that she hoped for a \u201cswift ending and resolution of this whole issue.\u201d \u2018So he thanked us for bringing him to that point\u2019: In discussing key finding No. 2 \u2013 that the CIA misled Congress and the public about torture \u2013 today on the Senate floor, Dianne Feinstein said \u201cThis conclusion is somewhat personal for me.\u201d Feinstein went on to tell a story about a meeting with then CIA-director Michael Hayden in which she says Hayden downplayed the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d the CIA was using with talk about a \u201ctummy slap\u201d. Hayden now has said Feinstein was \u201cincorrect\u201d in her characterization of the meeting. He spoke today with NewsMaxTV, in an interview flagged by BuzzFeed: NewsMaxTV: General, did you lie to the Committee in 2006 \u2014 I believe September of 2006 \u2014 the entire Committee, when you spoke to them? Hayden: No, would be the straightforward and simple answer. NewsMaxTV: Did you ever lie to that Committee? Hayden: No, of course not. Look \u2014 first of all, it\u2019s a felony. A couple other points to be made, Steve, alright? That briefing took place because Mike Hayden and the Agency wanted it to take place. This was our work, in the summer of 2006, to convince the Administration that we had to brief the entire Committee on the entire detention and interrogation program. And so I ask you \u2014 I\u2019m fighting with the administration, CIA\u2019s in the adminstration, to get an audience to Congress so we can lie to them? I\u2019m, you know \u2026 NewsMaxTV: So when Dianne Feinstein today says you lied, is she lying? Hayden: Uh, I\u2019ll go so far as to say she\u2019s incorrect. I mean, lying is intentionally misleading someone, alright? Let me make another distinction: telling people something they don\u2019t want to hear is not the same thing as telling people something that is untrue. UPDATE: Here\u2019s a portion of a just-published Guardian editorial on the Senate report : In one sense, it is a tribute to the US that it has published such a report. It is certainly a huge contrast to the cosy inadequacy of UK policy, practice and accountability \u2013 shortcomings that parliament must address. But it is a report about state crimes that should never have been committed, should never have been authorised, should never have been ignored by the US\u2019s allies \u2013 and which remain unpunished. Moreover, the report has only been published now because, next month, a change of political control in the US Senate would have led to its suppression by the Republicans. Read the full editorial here. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad, we\u2019ve been told, over and over again, for more than a decade,\u201d Trevor Timm writes in his new Comment Is Free piece, Stop believing the lies: America tortured more than \u2018some folks\u2019 \u2013 and covered it up: \u201cWe only waterboarded three people\u201d goes the line American officials have been force-feeding the world for years. \u201cWe tortured some folks,\u201d Barack Obama admitted recently, still downplaying war crimes committed in America\u2019s name. But we now know those statements do not even begin to do justice to the horrific activities carried out by the CIA for years \u2013 atrocities that now have been exposed by the US Senate\u2019s historic report on the CIA\u2019s torture program, finally released on Tuesday after years of delay. There are stories in the CIA torture report of \u201crectal rehydration as a means of behavior control\u201d, threats to murder and \u201cthreats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee\u201d \u2013 or cut a mother\u2019s throat. There are details about detainees with broken bones forced to stand for days on end, detainees blindfolded, dragged down hallways while they were beaten. There were even torture sessions that ended in death. The list goes on and on, and on and on. But beyond all the the depravity, perhaps the most shocking part of this exposed history is the action of US officials who knew these horrors were unfolding \u2013 and covered them up. Read the full piece here. Further horrific detail from the report. The Guardian\u2019s Kayla Epstein (@kaylaepstein) and Sarah Galo (@sarahevonne) have put together a thorough roundup of these kinds of excerpts \u2013 read it here. Here\u2019s a clip from Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s speech on the Senate floor this morning in disclosing the CIA torture report, which she said revealed actions that are \u201ca stain on our value and on our history.\u201d The release of this 500-page summary cannot remove that stain. But it can and does say... that America is big enough to admit when it\u2019s wrong\u201d (thx @maeryan) Cash for \u201cconsistently superior work\u201d: National security writer Marcy Wheeler notes it\u2019s uncanny that the Senate report uses pseudonyms for the two psychologist architects of the CIA torture program, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, whose identities have been public knowledge for five years. CIA director John Brennan has released a statement rebutting the Senate report. The statement asserts that the torture practices, called EITs for \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d, \u201cdid produce intelligence that helped ... save lives\u201d. It reads in part: As noted in CIA\u2019s response to the study, we acknowledge that the detention and interrogation program had shortcomings and that the Agency made mistakes. The most serious problems occurred early on and stemmed from the fact that the Agency was unprepared and lacked the core competencies required to carry out an unprecedented, worldwide program of detaining and interrogating suspected al-Qa\u2019ida and affiliated terrorists. In carrying out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the American people expect of us. As an Agency, we have learned from these mistakes, which is why my predecessors and I have implemented various remedial measures over the years to address institutional deficiencies. Yet, despite common ground with some of the findings of the Committee\u2019s Study, we part ways with the Committee on some key points. Our review indicates that interrogations of detainees on whom EITs were used did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives. The intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of al-Qa\u2019ida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day. We also disagree with the Study\u2019s characterization of how CIA briefed the program to the Congress, various entities within the Executive Branch, and the public. The full CIA statement is here. British prime minister David Cameron has spoken to reporters about the Senate report. \u201cTorture is wrong, torture is always wrong,\u201d he said: Those of us who want to see a safer and more secure world, who want to see extremism defeated, we won\u2019t succeed if we lose our moral authority, if we lose the things that make or systems work and countries successful. After 9/11 there were things that happened that were wrong and we should be clear about the fact that they were wrong. In Britain we have had the Gibson inquiry that has now produced a series of questions that the intelligence and security committee will look at. But I am satisfied out system is dealing with all of those issues and I as prime minister have issued guidance to all of our agents and others working around the world about how they have to handle these issues in future. I am confident this issue has been dealt with from a British perspective and I think I can reassure the British public about that. But overall we should be clear torture is wrong. Contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen played a critical role in establishing the torture program in 2002, according to today\u2019s disclosures. A company the pair formed received $81m in payouts by 2009, Feinstein said on the Senate floor. The Guardian interviewed Mitchell, a retired air force psychologist, in April 2014. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy who got asked to do something for his country,\u201d he said at the time: [Mitchell] insists he is not the monster many have portrayed him to be. \u201cThe narrative that\u2019s out there is, I walked up to the gate of the CIA, knocked on the door and said: \u2018Let me in, I want to torture people, and I can show you how to do it.\u2019 Or someone put out an ad on Craigslist that said, \u2018Wanted: psychologist who is willing to design torture program.\u2019 It\u2019s a lot more complicated than that,\u201d Mitchell told the Guardian in his first public comments since he was linked to the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation program seven years ago. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy who got asked to do something for his country by people at the highest level of government, and I did the best that I could.\u201d A well-paid guy whatever the case. Read the full report here. Despite being one of the countries entangled in the CIA\u2019s post-2001 secret war on terror, Pakistan showed little interest in the publication of the Senate committee\u2019s historic report, the Guardian\u2019s Jon Boone (@jon_boone) reports from Islamabad: The country\u2019s boisterous news channels remained focussed on domestic political dramas, in particular a deadly clash between pro and anti-government demonstrators that took place on Monday. Many hours after digital copies of the full report had flooded the internet the country\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said no one had yet read the document. \u201cI can\u2019t comment until we have read it in the morning,\u201d said Tasneem Aslam, the foreign ministry spokesperson. \u201cWhat is clear is that whatever assistance we may have rendered was in line with our commitment to fighting terrorism and our obligations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\u201d White House officials are continuing to draw focus to heightened security at US outposts worldwide, the Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts reports: On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry called Senator Dianne Feinstein \u2013 the California Democrat who spearheaded the inquiry \u2013 to urge consideration of what spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the \u201cforeign policy implications\u201d of the report\u2019s timing, suggesting it could inflame anti-American outrage worldwide. (h/t: @attackerman) Disturbing revelations about just what \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d meant continue to emerge: As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The CIA conducted a torture program that was \u201cfar more brutal than people were led to believe\u201d and misled Congress, the White House and the public as to the existence of the program from late 2001 through 2009, according to portions of a Senate report on the program released Tuesday. The approximately 500 pages of Senate findings released Tuesday constituted the most detailed look yet at the US practice of torture in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The Senate report detailed previously undisclosed torture techniques used by the CIA on detainees, which were revealed to number 119 \u2013 a higher number than previously disclosed. The newly revealed techniques included rectal feeding and rehydration as a form of manipulation. Key findings of the Senate report, presented by intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein on the floor of the Senate, included that \u201cthe CIA\u2019s \u2018enhanced interrogation techniques\u2019 were not effective\u201d and \u201cthe CIA\u2019s management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed\u201d. Read a news story here summarizing the Senate\u2019s report on the CIA torture program. The report was greeted with international calls for prosecutions. \u201cThe individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today\u2019s report must be brought to justice,\u201d the UN counterterrorism rapporteur said. US president Barack Obama said in a statement that the report \u201cdocuments a troubling program\u201d that \u201cdid significant damage to America\u2019s standing in the world\u201d. The director of national intelligence pushed back against the report, calling it \u201cfraught with controversy and passion\u201d and saying it was not \u201cneutral\u201d. Amnesty International has echoed the UN call for the prosecution of architects of the torture program. The USA \u2018must...hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d Amnesty International Americas director Erika Guevara Rosas says in a statement: \u201cThis report provides yet more damning detail of some of the human rights violations that were authorised by the highest authorities in the USA after 9/11. The declassified information contained in the summary, while limited, are a reminder to the world of the utter failure of the USA to end the impunity enjoyed by those who authorised and used torture and other ill-treatment. This is a wake-up call to the USA, they must disclose the full truth about the human rights violations, hold perpetrators accountable and ensure justice for the victims. This is not a policy nicety, it is a requirement under international law.\u201d Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts is taking in a briefing by White House officials on the torture report: The Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman and Alan Yuhas have assembled a list of key figures attached to the Senate report released today, including officials, torturers, tortured detainees and other detainees held at black sites and at Guantanamo Bay. Here are three selections from the piece: Cofer Black \u2013 CIA counter-terrorism chief Black was the head of the CIA Counterterrorist Center on 9/11 and when the torture program was incubated for testing on Abu Zubaydah. Black gained a degree of notoriety in 2002 for telling Congress that after 9/11 \u201cthe gloves come off\u201d. He shrugged off criticism of the torture program in 2008: \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of interrogations, but you know, life\u2019s tough and there are no easy answers. The American people have to decide if they want interrogations done or not.\u201d Jose Rodriguez \u2013 CIA counter-terrorism chief Black\u2019s successor as head of the CIA Counterterrorist Center and later deputy director of operations. Rodriguez destroyed approximately 100 videotapes of interrogations \u2013 even using machine tools to do so. His actions, which he maintains were entirely his own and not prompted by any orders, prompted the Senate torture inquiry. Abu Zubaydah A Saudi Arabian who at some point before his capture suffered a form of \u201ccognitive impairment\u201d from a head injury, Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002. He is accused of acting as a senior lieutenant in al-Qaida. Zubaydah was the first person tortured by the CIA, and waterboarded at least 83 times. He has been held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay for more than eight years. The most recent photo of him shows an eye-patch over his left eye, which he was not wearing when he was arrested. Read the full piece here. Several analysts are picking up on an acknowledgment in the report that at least one person who died from torture in CIA custody was a case of mistaken identity: UPDATE 1.59pm ET: It\u2019s possible that this report about a case of mistaken identity may itself mistake an identity. We\u2019re working to clarify. Contents of original post below. UPDATE 4.35pm ET: It appears that the Gul Rahman who was held as a result of mistaken identity was not the one who died but the second man named Gul Rahman who was held for a month: To avoid further confusion we\u2019ve deleted the original contents of this block featuring two tweets by experts saying that the Gul Rahman who was killed was also a case of mistaken identity. UPDATE 5.09pm ET: All now agree that the detainee held in a case of mistaken identity was not the Gul Rahman who died in custody. The other one however did. Representative Mike Rogers, the retiring chairman of the House intelligence committee who has vociferously objected to the report\u2019s release, continues to do so. \u201cI regret that the Senate Intelligence Committee has publicly released this report,\u201d Rogers says in a statement that continues: Though it is wholly appropriate for the congressional intelligence committees to conduct rigorous review of classified programs, I fear that publicizing the details of this classified program \u2013 which was legal, authorized, and appropriately briefed to the intelligence committees \u2013 will only inflame our enemies, risk the lives of those who continue to sacrifice on our behalf, and undermine the very organization we continuously ask to do the hardest jobs in the toughest places. In the months and years after 9/11, the men and women of the CIA answered America\u2019s demand for action by leaving their families and risking their lives to protect the rest of us. For that, they deserve America\u2019s highest praise and thanks.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) has compiled a report, \u201cRectal rehydration and waterboarding: how the CIA tortured its detainees\u201d. Here\u2019s the top of Oliver\u2019s report, describing the CIA practice of rectal feeding and rehydration of detainee: Rectal feeding and rehydration The torture report contains new information on the CIA\u2019s use of rectal feeding and rehydration. At least five detainees were subjected to the process, the report states. The report details how accused USS Cole bomber Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was placed \u201cin a forward facing position (Trendlenberg) with head lower than torso\u201d, whilst undergoing rectal feeding. Another detainee, Majid Khan, a legal resident of the United States and accused confident of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was also subjected to rectal feeding. According to a CIA cable released in the report his \u201c\u2018lunch tray\u2019 consisting of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins was \u2018pureed and rectally infused\u2019\u201d. Mohammed was also subjected to rectal rehydration \u201cwithout a determination of medical need\u201d. Mohammed\u2019s chief interrogator described use of the process as emblematic of their \u201ctotal control over the detainee\u201d. Read the full piece on what we know about torture techniques used by the CIA here. Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) has filed a news story on the contents of the CIA torture report. The story names the contractor psychologists paid by the CIA to establish and carry out the torture program. The story reads in part: The torture that the CIA carried out was even more extreme than what it portrayed to congressional overseers and the George W Bush administration, the committee found. It went beyond techniques already made public through a decade of leaks and lawsuits, which had revealed that agency interrogators subjected detainees to quasi-drowning, staged mock executions, and revved power drills near their heads. At least 39 detainees, the committee found, experienced techniques like \u201ccold water dousing\u201d \u2013 different from the quasi-drowning known as waterboarding \u2013 which the Justice Department never approved. The committee found at least five cases of \u201crectal rehydration\u201d, and cases of death threats made to detainees. CIA interrogators, the committee charged, told detainees they would hurt their children and \u201csexually assault\u201d or kill their wives. At least 17 were tortured without the approval from CIA headquarters that ex-director George Tenet assured the Justice Department would occur. And at least 26 of the CIA\u2019s estimated 119 detainees, the committee found, were \u201cwrongfully held\u201d. Contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen played a critical role in establishing the torture program in 2002. A company they formed to contract their services to the CIA was worth more than $180m, and by the time of the contract\u2019s 2009 cancellation, they had received $81m in payouts.

The UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, has released a statement saying \u201cIt is now time to take action\u201d and \u201cThe individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today\u2019s report must be brought to justice.\u201d The statement reads in part: The summary of the report which was released this afternoon confirms what the international community has long believed - that there was a clear policy orchestrated at a high level within the Bush administration to commit systematic crimes and gross violations of international human rights law. The identities of the perpetrators, and many other details, have been redacted in the published summary report but are known to the Select Committee and to those who provided the Committee with information on the programme. It is now time to take action. The individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today\u2019s report must be brought to justice, and must face criminal penalties commensurate with the gravity of their crimes. The fact that the policies revealed in this report were authorised at a high level within the US Government provides no excuse whatsoever. Indeed, it reinforces the need for criminal accountability. International law prohibits the granting of immunities to public officials who have engaged in acts of torture. This applies not only to the actual perpetrators but also to those senior officials within the US Government who devised, planned and authorised these crimes. As a matter of international law, the US is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice. John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, takes the floor after Feinstein. He praises the release of the report. He says \u201cthe American people are entitled\u201d to know what is done \u201cin their name.\u201d He says the torture program \u201cstained our national honor, did much harm and did little practical good.\u201d \u201cThe American people need answers to these questions,\u201d McCain continues. \u201cThe committee has empowered the American people to come to their own decisions... this report strengthens self-government and ultimately, I believe, America\u2019s ... stature in the world.\u201d \u201cI know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will produce more bad than good intelligence,\u201d McCain says. \u201cI know that bad things happen in war,\u201d McCain says. \u201cI know that those who approved [torture] and those who used [torture]... I know their responsibilities were grave and urgent... But I dispute wholeheartedly that it was right for them to use these methods.\u201d James Clapper, director of national intelligence, has issued a statement on the Senate report, which he says is \u201cfraught with controversy and passion\u201d. Here\u2019s part of the statement: In all of my experience in intelligence, I am hard-pressed to recall another report\u2014and the issues surrounding it\u2014as fraught with controversy and passion as this one. Virtually no one who has any familiarity with the report and what it describes is \u201cneutral.\u201d The rebuttal to the majority report issued by the minority on the Committee is but one example of strong alternative views. Proponents of publication ardently believe that the report must be issued to cleanse a stain on the pages of our history, and to ensure that the practices it describes are never repeated. Others, with equal conviction, believe that the report is unfair and biased; fails to account for the immediate impact of the attacks on 9/11\u2014on American citizens and on those in government charged with protecting the country; and will result in greater jeopardy to American citizens, facilities and interests overseas. The officers who participated in the program believed with certainty that they were engaged in a program devised by our government on behalf of the President that was necessary to protect the nation, that had appropriate legal authorization, and that was sanctioned by at least some in the Congress. But, as President Obama has made clear, some things were done that should not have been done \u2014and which transgressed our values. We recognized this ten years ago and stopped the program as it was originally conducted; even more important, we have since enacted laws, implemented Presidential orders and established internal policies to ensure that such things never happen again. Feinstein says that following revelations of abuses in facilities including Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq overseen by the Pentagon, Congress was assured that the CIA did not engage in any comparably brutal abuse. \u201cThis of course was false,\u201d she says. CIA detainees in one facility were held in \u201ca dungeon\u201d crowded in a cell with loud music and \u201conly a bucket to use for waste.\u201d A US official visited and said they had \u201cnever been in a facility where individuals are so sensory deprived,\u201d Feinstein says. \u201cMultiple CIA detainees exhibited psychological... issues,\u201d she says, including attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation. \u201cThe summary includes far more detail than I\u2019m going to provide here, and the summary itself contains only a subset of the treatment of the 119 detainees. .. There is far more detail.\u201d Feinstein is describing interrogation in the Cobalt facility. One technique: Rough takedowns, in which a detainee dragged from cell, clothes cut off, hooded and dragged in dirt. Agents told detainee Abu Zubaydah that \u201che would only leave in a coffin-shaped box.\u201d They planned to cremate him if he died, she says, quoting a CIA cable. Feinstein moves to the report\u2019s fourth key finding, \u201cThe CIA program was far more brutal than the CIA represented to policymakers and the American public.\u201d Feinstein describes two CIA contractors who personally tortured the \u201chighest-value\u201d detainees including Khalid Shiekh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Nishiri (you can read more about them here). In 2005, the two contractors formed a company to expand their activities with the CIA, she says, and from 2005-2008, they had a contract for more than $180m to carry out these activities. \u201cTHe CIA has paid these two contractors and their company more than $80m,\u201d she says. Feinstein moves to the report\u2019s third Key Finding, that \u201cthe CIA\u2019s management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed.\u201d No single individual or office was in charge of the program until January 2003, at which point at least 1/3 of detainees had been detained and interrogated, she says. She recounts the death of a detainee at an undisclosed probably of hypothermia in 2002. \u201cCIA\u2019s leadership acknowledged that they had little or no knowledge of operations\u201d at this particular site, code named Cobalt. \u201cThe CIA used poorly trained and non-vetted personnel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear fact that the CIA deployed officers who had histories of personal, ethical and professional problems of a serious nature.\u201d Here is a link to download a rebuttal by Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee to today\u2019s report. Authors include the incoming chairman of the committee, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina: Feinstein reads the restrictions on paper on CIA interrogation techniques. None was observed, she says. \u201cNone of these assurances which the department of justice relied on to form its legal opinions were [sic]... carried out,\u201d Feinstein says. Now Feinstein is talking about how the CIA misled Congress, the administration and the public as to the nature of the torture program. \u201cThis conclusion is somewhat personal for me,\u201d she says. She recalls a September 2006 committee meeting in which former CIA director Michael Hayden referred to a \u201ctummy slap\u201d in describing the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d \u201cThe constraints that existed on paper in Washington did not match how the techniques were used around the world,\u201d Feinstein says. She begins to talk about \u201cnonstop abuse\u201d over 17 days of Abu Zubaydah. The \u201cinterrogation techniques\u201d did produce bad or false intelligence, however, Feinstein says. In some cases CIA agents knew they were being lied to; in others they did not, she says. Feinstein is describing 20 claims the CIA made for the value of intelligence gleaned through torture. None of these claims held up under examination. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s claims that the EITs were necessary ... that\u2019s a claim we conclude is inaccurate,\u201d she says: We took 20 examples that the CIA itself claimed to show the success of these interrogations. The CIA used these examples in presentations to the White House, testimony to Congress and... ultimately to the American people. \u201cOur staff reviewed every one of the 20 cases and not a single case holds up,\u201d Feinstein says. The study doesn\u2019t claim no intelligence was gained, but that \u201cactionable intelligence that was otherwise unavailable\u201d was not obtained, she says. Feinstein says the report found that the torture program was \u201cmorally, legally and administratively misguided and that this nation should never again engage in these tactics.\u201d The CIA program \u201cwas far more brutal than people were led to believe,\u201d she says. Drafts of the report were done by late 2011 and the final report was done at the end of 2012 and approved 9-6, Feinstein says. Then the committee sent the report to the White House, she says. The Senate took advice from the CIA, some of which it included. The committee then voted 12-3 to declassify and release the summary of findings and conclusions. Feinstein said the committee rejected a White House redacted version. \u201cIt was immediately apparent that the redaction of our report prevented a clear and understandable reading of our study,\u201d she says. Feinstein says they were unable to interview key figures in the CIA about the agency\u2019s torture activities, but Senate staffers did draw on transcripts of interviews with the key figures about the program. The figures she names and their former posts: George Tenet, CIA director Jose Rodriguez, director, CIA counter-terror program Scott Muller, CIA general counsel John Rizzo, CIA acting counsel John Mclaachlin, CIA deputy director As you listen to Feinstein on CSPAN, you might follow Trevor Timm and Spencer Ackerman on Twitter as they unpack the document: \u201cA surprisingly few people were responsible for designing... and carrying out this program,\u201d Feinstein says. Two contractors designed it, she says, and thenceforth the program had \u201clittle oversight\u201d. The report \u201cexposes brutality in stark contrast to our values as a nation,\u201d she says. It covers CIA activities from late 2001 through January 2009, and includes detail on CIA interaction with White House, defense and state departments and the intelligence committee. Potentially related: Feinstein calls the torture program a \u201cstain\u201d on the national character. \u201cThe release of this 500-page summary cannot remove that stain, but it can say to our people and the world that America is big enough to admit when it\u2019s wrong... Feinstein says releasing the report is a step toward \u201creclaiming our values.\u201d Previous estimates of the number of prisoners in the CIA\u2019s secret rendition, detention and interrogation program had run to about 100. Today the number, made public for the first time, is 119: Feinstein says an executive summary of 500 pages from the report to be released today documents \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d carried out by the CIA on \u201cat least 119 individuals... in some cases amounting to torture.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a great deal of introspection about whether to delay the release of this report,\u201d she says. Unfortunately there may never be a good time, she says. \u201cHistory will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and our willingness to confront the ugly truth and say, \u2018Never Again\u2019.\u201d \u201cThis report is too important to shelve indefinitely.\u201d Reid continues: \u201cWhat took place in the torture program was not in keeping with our country.\u201d Now it\u2019s Feinstein. Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) is making a first pass through the report. In addition to evaluating the \u201cefficacy\u201d of the torture program, the Senate details the nature of the torture itself. Here\u2019s one passage: Senate Majority leader Harry Reid takes the floor. \u201cToday for the first time the American people are going to learn the full truth about the torture that went on under the CIA...\u201d he begins. Unlike the president, Reid calls it \u201ctorture\u201d. He\u2019s introducing Feinstein. \u201cShe\u2019s persevered and overcome obstacles that have been significant to make this study available to the American people\u201d. Feinstein hasn\u2019t even begun speaking yet and already the White House has released a statement on the report she is disclosing. It\u2019s a longish statement, attributed to President Barack Obama. He calls the program \u201ctroubling\u201d. It says \u201cI unequivocally banned torture when I took office,\u201d but it does not directly refer to the CIA activities as \u201ctorture\u201d. Here are the last two paragraphs (via @robertsdan): Today\u2019s report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence details one element of our nation\u2019s response to 9/11\u2014the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program, which I formally ended on one of my first days in office. The report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects in secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values as nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests. Moreover, these techniques did significant damage to America\u2019s standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners. That is why I will continue to use my authority as President to make sure we never resort to those methods again. As Commander in Chief, I have no greater responsibility than the safety and security of the American people. We will therefore continue to be relentless in our fight against al Qaeda, its affiliates and other violent extremists. We will rely on all elements of our national power, including the power and example of our founding ideals. That is why I have consistently supported the declassification of today\u2019s report. No nation is perfect. But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better. Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today\u2019s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong\u2014in the past. Today is also a reminder that upholding the values we profess doesn\u2019t make us weaker, it makes us stronger and that the United States of America will remain the greatest force for freedom and human dignity that the world has ever known. If you would like to download the pieces of the report that are being released today you may do that at the link below. Note that it\u2019s a large file. #ff Follow the link to read a Feinstein press release on what she is about to say. The press release says the executive summary of the report and additional material will be on the senator\u2019s web site but it doesn\u2019t appear to be there yet. The news release presents \u201ckey findings\u201d: Key findings The study\u2019s 20 findings and conclusions can be grouped into four central themes, each of which is supported extensively in the Executive Summary: 1. The CIA\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d were not effective. 2. The CIA provided extensive inaccurate information about the operation of the program and its effectiveness to policymakers and the public. 3. The CIA\u2019s management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed. 4. The CIA program was far more brutal than the CIA represented to policymakers and the American public. To say that the speech we are about to hear \u2013 expected to explain why the Senate has decided to share with the public what it has learned about CIA torture \u2013 has been a long time coming is to understate the matter. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) has traced the evolution of the Senate investigation into the CIA torture program, beginning with the election of Barack Obama, who as a candidate promised that \u201cnobody is above the law\u201d: Only the most cynical could have guessed back then that it would take six years even for a limited official account of what happened to emerge, that it would be Obama\u2019s own administration that stood in the way of its publication and that no one would end up taking personal responsibility for the crimes or the cover-up. But, like the practice of enhanced interrogation itself, this dark addendum to the story of the US war on terror has served mainly to illustrate the compromises of power rather than shed meaningful light on its uses. Some of the arguments over \u201ccompromises of power\u201d were more colorful than others: Obama\u2019s first chief of staff and Chicago confidant Rahm Emmanuel reportedly dressed down former defense secretary Leon Panetta for agreeing to co-operate with the Senate inquiry. \u201cI was summoned to a meeting in the Situation Room, where I was told I would have to \u2018explain\u2019 this deal to Rahm \u2026 It did not take long to get ugly,\u201d Panetta claimed in his memoir, Worthy Fights. \u201c\u2019The president wants to know who the f**k authorized this to the committees,\u2019 Rahm said, slamming his hand down on the table. \u201cI have a president with his hair on fire and I want to know what the f**k you did to f**k this up so bad.\u201d Read the full piece here. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat from California who is about to lose the gavel of the intelligence committee as Republicans take the majority, is on the Senate floor. The Senate is conducting a roll call vote on a cloture motion (a vote to end debate) in the nomination of Virginia Tyler Lodge to join the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. You can watch it live on C-SPAN here. Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of the anticipated release of a major new chapter in the secret history of a torture program operated by the CIA at clandestine sites around the world in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Senate intelligence committee chair Dianne Feinstein is scheduled to deliver remarks about the CIA torture report on the Senate floor at approximately 11am ET. It is expected that Feinstein will announce the release of part of a 6,000-page report on the torture program. The report was assembled by Senate staffers who spent four years reviewing millions of CIA documents (but who reportedly did not interview key prisoners who were tortured, or their CIA interrogators). It is the most thorough public accounting yet of torture conducted by the CIA. The report describes how detainees swept up in the US search for terrorism suspects beginning in 2002 were confined at so-called \u201cblack sites\u201d and subjected to torture practices including waterboarding, beatings, threats, confinement in a box, chilling, sleep deprivation, stress positions and forced nudity. The report confronts the questions of what interrogators learned by using torture and the extent to which the activities were hidden from George W Bush administration officials and Congress. The Senate inquiry, led by intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, was not a criminal investigation and is not considered likely to result in criminal charges. The creation and now release of the report has been marked by fierce infighting between the CIA and the Senate and the Senate and the White House. In July, CIA director John Brennan appeared on Capitol Hill to apologize for spying on Senate staffers as they worked. In August, the Senate rejected a proposal by the Obama administration to release a version of the report more heavily redacted than the version released today. Former president Bush stepped forward to defend the CIA in advance of the report\u2019s release. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,\u201d Bush told CNN on Sunday. \u201cThese are patriots and whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base.\u201d Guardian reporters led by national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) will be working through the day to explain what\u2019s in the report. We\u2019ll carry reaction from the White House on down and bring you all the latest updates in today\u2019s live blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
