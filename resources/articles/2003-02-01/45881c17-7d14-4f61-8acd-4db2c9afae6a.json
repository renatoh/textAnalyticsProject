Live shows by Alison Goldfrapp, a former collaborator of Tricky and Orbital, and partner/session musician Will Gregory, also demonstrated their mastery of textures and spooky atmospheres. On April 28, Goldfrapp will be releasing their eagerly anticipated follow-up, Black Cherry. While Felt Mountain was infused with dark fantasy and imaginary landscapes, Black Cherry takes the energy of the city and the whirl of fairgrounds as its jump off point. As Alison Goldfrapp explains, \"I love disco, Donna Summer, Macarthur Park, all that stuff. On the last album people would go, 'what are your influences?' and I'd go, 'Ennio Morricone and disco'. Black Cherry has that same campness but campness explored in a different way.\" As a warm up to their UK tour in May, Goldfrapp are playing a sold-out gig at ULU on Thursday, March 6. You and a friend can be among the first to hear the new material because we have two - yes, just two - tickets to the gig. All you have to do to be in with a chance to go is email arts.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk with your name and daytime telephone number and 'Goldfrapp' in the subject heading by Sunday March 2. We'll contact the winner by 1pm on Wednesday March 5."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
