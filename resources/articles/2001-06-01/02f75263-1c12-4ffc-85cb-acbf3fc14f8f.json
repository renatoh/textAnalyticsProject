It's an excellent idea for a thriller, and writer-director Simon Marshall tells us that it's actually based on the true and tragic story of a friend of his. But that doesn't stop it being unconvincing, cliched and derivative, with dodgy dialogue and outrageous over-acting. Nicholas Ball is Lenny, the pop-eyed Pirhana brother, in Marshall's quaintly imagined universe of geezers: he's tasty, lairy, and mental. When young Paul Nixon and his mate Steve, played by Sean Maguire and Danny Midwinter, tell him how a slag attacked and humiliated Paul's diamond old mum by urinating on her, Ball's brow contracts in a worrying frown: \"He pissed on her? Fair do's. The geezer deserves a slap.\" Ooo-er. It takes skill to bring out intentional black comedy in violent crime, and I'm afraid this film doesn't have it - although Rita Tushingham is a delicate, dignified presence. And finally flashing up the solemn dedication, To the Real Paul Nixon, immediately after Paul gets horribly \"done\" in the prison bogs is surely not the most sensitive way of remembering him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
