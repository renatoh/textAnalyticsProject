But a survey of the quality of life in cities around the world has put the two cities on a par with their international neighbours. While Zurich was rated the best place to live, Glasgow and Birmingham were the only British cities, apart from London, to feature in the survey - gaining a joint 55th rank along with those Califormia and Japanese cities. London came in ahead, maintaining its place from last year at 39. It trailed behind Paris, ranked at 33, but was judged ahead of New York, at 46. Dublin managed 24th in the research -dropping two places from last year mainly due to worse traffic congestion - and, at the other end of the scale, Baghdad was, perhaps unsurprisingly, judged to offer the worst quality of life for expatriates, ahead of Brazzaville in the Congo and Bangui in the Central African Republic. Generally there was a good showing for European cities - which dominated the top rankings alongside Canada and Australia - in Mercer Human Resource Consulting's survey considering factors such as personal safety, the environment and access to health, education, transport and other public services, in 215 cities across the world. This year cities in eastern Europe, such as Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague, Vilnius, Tallinn and Warsaw, climbed the rankings. Slagin Parakatil, senior researcher at Mercer, said the standard of living there was gradually improving as the new EU countries attracted investment. Cities such as Dubai, however, could still offer a wider variety of facilities, such as \"well-connected international airports and better opportunities for recreation and leisure\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
