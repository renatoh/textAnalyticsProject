It was basically one that the horse made for us, because as soon as the vet put the endoscope down him he could see that it was a really bad bleed. You just can't take any risks running a horse when they're like that, because you can end up doing them permanent damage. All you can do is what's best by your horse. Jackie Jenner, who was riding him yesterday, said that he felt like he'd broken a leg. He just completely lost everything when the blood came out, and it poured out of him. It wasn't a little bleed, it was a proper job, so the only decision anyone could take was to write off this season and then bring him back next year. Of course it's a sickener, but there's only one thing to do and that's to take it on the chin. Some people might go away and get depressed about it, but that's not going to change anything. You get used to things like this happening when you're in this game. All we can do now is to make sure that he gets a good summer's rest. Then he'll be back into the yard next autumn, he will have got the virus out of his system and it will be all systems go for Gold Cup No4. It could have been a lot worse, after all. He might easily have suffered a leg injury, and they don't generally come back from those. But when a horse bursts a blood vessel, you expect them to come back 100% once they've had some time to recover. The most frustrating thing about it for everyone at the yard is that when he's been out recently he's looked a picture. He's been bucking and kicking like he was in great form, and when he worked last week he went really well. But this year has been a nightmare for viruses going around. Everybody's had problems, and I think most of the big yards have had a bit of it, with some of them even having to close down completely. We knew that Best Mate had had a virus when he was beaten by Beef Or Salmon over in Ireland at Christmas, and a trainer will tell you that you never really know whether a horse has come right after something like that until you put them under a little pressure. The bug has obviously been lingering there in his system and, even though he appeared to be so well, the extra bit of strain and tension in yesterday's gallop brought it out. We've had a good innings with him so far, though, and had as much luck with his preparation every year as anyone can expect. We've gone there three times with the horse absolutely 100%, and I've no doubt that when he's fit and well again he can win the race for a fourth time next year. He's only a 10-year-old even now, and he's got no miles on the clock at all. He's had less than 20 races in his whole career, when you'll find some horses that get close to that in one season. I'll go to the Cheltenham Festival now hoping to make the best of a bad situation. Normally I might have been looking after myself a little bit over the first days of the meeting so that I could be sure of being fit for Best Mate, but now I'll hope to have a ride in nearly every race. Henrietta Knight has some useful horses entered, particularly in the novice hurdles, and we'll be hoping to make up just a little bit for the disappointment that everyone at the yard is feeling now. I may not have a ride in the Gold Cup now, but if I don't I'll still be watching the race with interest because the winner will probably be up against us next spring. It's a really tough race to call now, though, and there's at least half a dozen horses whose connections will be going there thinking that they've got a real chance to win it. Kicking King is obviously a class horse, as he showed when he won the King George at Kempton, but there's a big question mark over whether he'll get the trip and I personally think that he's going to struggle. If Strong Flow is back to his best he could be another one to watch out for, but I can also see something like Celestial Gold coming from behind to win. Timmy Murphy is the perfect jockey for letting the race unfold in front of him, and he's on a proper hold-up horse. Now that Best Mate's not there, I'm thinking that Celestial Gold could be the one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
