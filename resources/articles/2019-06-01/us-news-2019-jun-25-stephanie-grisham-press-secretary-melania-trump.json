Grisham\u2019s current boss, Melania Trump, announced the move on Twitter on Tuesday. The tweet did not make clear whether Grisham would be solely working for the president or if she would keep her role speaking for the first lady. Trump wrote that her spokeswoman \u201chas been with us since 2015\u201d and added that she and her husband could \u201cthink of no better person to serve the administration and our country. Excited to have Stephanie working for both sides of the White House.\u201d It was later reported that Grisham would indeed take on all three roles \u2013 Trump's last communications director, Bill Shine, resigned abruptly in March. Sanders, under whom relations with the press have never been better than distinctly rocky, will leave at the end of June. She replaced Donald Trump\u2019s first press secretary, Sean Spicer, in 2017. Grisham has been a valued lieutenant to the first lady, though that has not made her immune from the everyday scandals and controversies of the Trump White House. She was reported for example to have clashed with John Kelly when the retired general was chief of staff, leading to the departure of a national security staffer. Grisham also found herself under the spotlight when in June 2018 Melania Trump flew to visit detained children at the Texas border while wearing a jacket which carried the apparently heartless slogan: \u201cI really don\u2019t care. Do U?\u201d Grisham has appeared, if fleetingly, in a number of tell-all books about the Trump presidency. Former White House aide Cliff Sims, for example, writes in Team of Vipers about how \u201cthe president loved Stephanie\u201d. \u201cStephanie was the travelling press secretary on the campaign and he loved her toughness,\u201d Sims writes. Grisham was a political operative in Arizona before she joined Trump around a rally in Phoenix in 2015. Sims also reports that Grisham came \u201cinto the White House as a deputy press secretary under Spicer, but quickly left to join the first lady\u2019s staff\u201d because \u201cSean kept her out of everything because she wasn\u2019t one of his people\u201d from the Republican National Committee. In Siege: Trump Under Fire, Michael Wolff notes that Grisham \u201cwas seen as especially protective\u201d of Melania Trump during political fights ranging \u201cthe East Wing against the West Wing\u201d. Grisham worked closely with the press during the 2012 election, when she worked for Mitt Romney, and in 2016. According to a Washington Post profile published in December 2018, such experience has given her good relationships with White House reporters. Such relationships may now be tested. Under Sanders, Donald Trump\u2019s combative relationship with the media never calmed down and White House press briefings were allowed to wither on the vine. Sanders has not held such a session since early March. The president, meanwhile, remains determined to speak without guidance or protection, often to controversial result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
