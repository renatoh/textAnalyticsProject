Here's another one he made earlier, which garnered terrific reviews from its 2009 incarnation at the Citizens' in Glasgow. Now remade for Hill Street (a Masonic Lodge), Sub Rosa is a gothic Victorian promenade that takes its name for the legal terminology for secrecy and takes the form of an investigation into a death. For the first time, a production at Hill Street had been granted full access to the building, including all the nooks and crannies like the Mason's \"Museum Room\", usually closed to the public. Hill Street Theatre, Sat to 30 Aug Lyn Gardner Lidless, Edinburgh The astonishingly well connected HighTide Festival has already had some success with Adam Brace's Stovepipe and Beth Steel's Ditch in the Old Vic Tunnels. Now the company makes its fringe debut with Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig's play about the meeting between a former Guant\u00e1namo Bay inmate and the woman who interrogated him while he was incarcerated 15 years previously. The play won the Yale Drama Series Award last year, but HighTide have nabbed the world premiere, no doubt with the help of acclaimed playwright and festival patron Sir David Hare. The fringe could do with more quality new writing outside of the Traverse festival season and this year it may well have found it in this and shows such as Frantic Assembly's Beautiful Burn Out at the Pleasance and Jack Thorne's Bunny at Underbelly. Underbelly Pasture, Sat to 30 Aug Lyn Gardner The Sun Also Rises, Edinburgh The Edinburgh International Festival's theatre strand kicks off with the latest from New York theatre makers Elevator Repair Service. It's their take on Ernest Hemingway's tale of a weary group of American exiles seeking solace and redemption in Spain during the bullfighting season. The bullfight itself will inevitably be the centrepiece, but this is a company that never does the obvious as it explores the possibilities of theatre and tries to prove that there are no limitations to what you can do on stage. Royal Lyceum, Sat to Tue Lyn Gardner The Persians, nr Sennybridge In a memorable first season from the National Theatre of Wales, here's one of the most eagerly awaited productions. Aeschylus's 472BC tragedy is being presented in a new version by Kaite O'Reilly and staged in an army training house in the heart of the Brecon Beacons military range. Sian Thomas leads a cast directed by Mike Pearson, who was artistic director of the Welsh site-specific company Brith Gof. Cilieni Village, Powys, Sat to 21 Aug Lyn Gardner Communicating Doors, Scarborough It's London, 2014. Civil war is raging on the streets of the capital but dominatrix Poupee Desir has other problems to worry about. The businessman who has summoned her to his hotel suite doesn't want sex, but he does want Poupee to witness his confession to the murder of his two wives. The ink is barely dry before the businessman dies and Poupee finds her life in danger, but the communicating doors in the hotel suite mysteriously take her back in time to 1994 and the night of the second wife's murder. From then it's but a short hop back to 1974 when the first wife was killed. Can the past be changed and could things be different? JB Priestley explored the territory with his own ingenious time warp plays, and Alan Ayckbourn's 1994 play that, like most of his works premiered at this address, uses similar tricks of time to ask if things might have got better if we only knew then what we know now. Stephen Joseph Theatre, Mon to 8 Oct Lyn Gardner National Youth Theatre, London Members of the NYT are going to be busy little bees, as 600 of them take to the streets for site-specific ensemble theatre at famous landmarks. S'Warm is inspired by the fall in the bee population, and will see actors moving in bee-like formations around the city. It all takes place at Battersea Park and Power Station on Wed &amp; 21 Aug, and at various other locations from Thu to 21 Aug. At the Tramshed, Shoreditch next month, the company embarks on Relish, about the first celebrity chef, Alexis Soyer, who rose from humble beginnings in 19th-century Paris to cook at Queen Victoria's coronation. Mark Cook Into The Woods, London Last year the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park made a terrific job of Hello, Dolly! as its annual musical. At the time, my companion remarked that a perfect show for the leafy venue would be Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Into The Woods. And so it has come to pass that the collection of grown-up versions of Grimm's fairytales is being staged there by artistic director Timothy Sheader. Hanna Waddingham and Jenna Russell are among the cast, and the voice of the giant is provided by the legendary Dame Judi Dench. Open Air Theatre, NW1, Mon to 11 Sep Mark Cook The Chairs, Bath In Eugene Ionesco's tragic 1952 farce, an elderly couple are preparing for an important occasion. The 95-year-old janitor, a man who has never been master of anything except mop and bucket, believes that he had an important message to deliver to the world. So he and his doting, often dotty, 94-year-old wife who live in a dark house on an isolated island are busy arranging and rearranging the chairs in expectation of the arrival of a large audience. It's a brilliant play \u2013 last given a major revival by Complicite at the Royal Court back in 1997 \u2013 that is a bit like Waiting For Godot. Only in this instance, Godot does actually turn up. As far as the old man and his wife are concerned, hundreds have turned up to hear the man's words of wisdom. Even though those words are delivered by a deaf-mute who can write only gibberish. The moral? Life is meaningless, but you can never have too many chairs for unexpected guests. Ustinov, Wed to 4 Sep Lyn Gardner"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
