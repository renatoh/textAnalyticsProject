But the achievement of Dwain Chambers, Mark Lewis-Francis and Darren Campbell in the Norwich Union Super League had a hollow ring. The performances of their main rivals were badly undermined by confusion over a false start in which Bernard Williams and John Capel of the United States and the Commonwealth champion Kim Collins from St Kitts failed to stop because they did not hear the recall gun. The three men raced all out to the line, with Collins crossing first ahead of Williams, while the British runners stopped. It would have been fairer had a rerun been held at the end of the meeting but after a delay of only eight minutes - mostly the time it took Collins and Williams to return to the start - they had to do it again. Chambers stormed to victory. Having blown themselves out earlier, Capel finished fourth, Williams sixth and Collins eighth and last. Williams, a stand-up comedian in his spare time, was not laughing and he threw a chair across the changing area in annoyance at missing out on the chance to win \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,900) and losing valuable grand prix points. \"The only thing I heard was the first gun and when you are in the zone the next thing you think about is crossing the line,\" said Capel. \"The gun has got to be sorted out because that was a top-class field and to have it spoilt by something that simple is just not good enough.\" Chambers did not care. He will take a victory any way he can with the world championships in Paris next month. This was only his second win in 10 months and will have helped re-establish his confidence after finishing fourth in the Golden League meeting in Rome on Friday, a race won by Capel. \"You have to be prepared for these things,\" said Chambers. \"I heard the first recall, but I still wasn't sure because everybody was still running. Then I heard the second and saw people slowing down. I won and I'm pleased about that. I am sure it worked in my favour. It is all down to mind and body and how prepared you are to deal with situations like that.\" A fast time continues to elude Chambers, however. His 10.27sec may not seem that impressive but it was run into a headwind of 3.2 metres per second, equating to a sub-10sec performance. The Londoner will also take satisfaction from the fact that he finished 0.08 ahead of Lewis-Francis as he beat him for the second consecutive race. Meanwhile Campbell, who is concentrating on the 200 metres, will be pleased at finishing only a hundredth behind Lewis-Francis in 10.36. Chambers later ran in the 200m, finishing second in 20.75, 0.02 behind the winner, Cardiff's Christian Malcolm. It completed a good meeting for Chambers and British sprinters as Marlon Devonish fin ished third, Campbell fourth and Julian Golding fifth. Katharine Merry took another tentative step on her long road to recovery when she finished fifth in her first 400 metres at this level for two years after having her career badly affected by injuries. Then she was the world No1, now she is just trying to re- establish herself. The winner was America's Demetria Washington in 51.29. Merry was happy with 52.35, nearly a second outside the 51.37 qualifying time she needs to book her Paris trip. \"There were times when the future looked like a long tunnel without even a flicker of light at the end,\" she said. \"Now I see some light. I know I can find a second. I fully intend to be in Paris.\" A high-quality meeting was completed when Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva improved the two-year-old pole vault world record by a centimetre with a leap of 4.82 metres. It was the first world record here since Brendan Foster set a 3,000m mark 29 years ago on the stadium's opening day. Isinbayeva's record earned her a bonus of $50,000 from the sponsors, their third such payout after Svetlana Feofanova's indoor records at meetings in Glasgow and Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
