Speaking to reporters on a party bus taking her on a tour of three Conservative-held seats that the Lib Dems say they have a chance of winning despite coming third in all of them in 2017, Swinson said a significant number of defections was \u201centirely feasible\u201d. \u201cI have had MPs from both of those parties say to me that I would be a better prime minister than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said. \u201cObviously, those people are standing under particular party banners. But it really is the case that those two old parties are fracturing. We\u2019ve already seen a lot of defections to the Liberal Democrats in recent months. \u201cIn the scenario that we do make this breakthrough then I wouldn\u2019t assume that everything else remains static.\u201d In recent months eight former Labour or Conservative MPs have defected to the Lib Dems, and Swinson said her party had already been in talks with others. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of people we\u2019ve had discussions with who didn\u2019t take the jump,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are considering that move do so on their own journey.\u201d A scenario in which defections could result in Swinson becoming prime minister does, however, seem extremely unlikely given the Lib Dems\u2019 starting base of just 20 seats, and expectations that even a good election might do no more than double this. The first stop on Swinson\u2019s inaugural bus tour of the campaign \u2013 using what the party believes is the only electric-powered coach in use in the UK \u2013 was in the north London constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, where former Labour MP Luciana Berger is pushing to unseat the incumbent Tory, despite the Lib Dems winning fewer than 3,500 votes in 2017. However, polling by Queen Mary University of London released on Tuesday showed that in London, the Lib Dems are attracting twice as much support as in 2017, with Labour down by 10 percentage points. \u201cI don\u2019t think the 2017 election is a good guide to our politics now,\u201d Swinson said. \u201cAll of that is evidence that the Liberal Democrats are in a very different place. We know that we are genuinely competitive in a huge number of seats now. And that includes seats where we\u2019ve never before really been in serious contention. And that\u2019s a very exciting place to be.\u201d It is Swinson\u2019s first election as leader \u2013 she only took over from Vince Cable in July \u2013 and she is very much the face of the party campaign. The bus has an enormous picture of her on it, with the party called, \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats\u201d, and the slogan: \u201cStop Brexit, build a brighter future.\u201d Brexit was the focus of the next stop, where Swinson visited Sigma, a pharmaceuticals supply company in Watford, which supplies a third of all UK pharmacies, and worries that Brexit could affect the supply of drugs from the EU. Paras Shah, the company\u2019s executive director, said Brexit could bring stock shortages and affect prices \u2013 even as he conceded he would probably vote Conservative in the adjoining constituency where he lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that just wants Brexit to be done,\u201d he added. In 2017 Watford was narrowly won by the Conservatives over Labour, with the Lib Dems taking less than 10% of the vote. But Swinson insisted such areas were now winnable. \u201cPolitics is very volatile at the moment, and it\u2019s volatile because we\u2019ve got a new fault line that runs right through both the Conservative and Labour parties as they currently are,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some people who hope, hope, hope it\u2019s going to go back to business as usual, and that they\u2019ll wake up from what they consider a nightmare and it\u2019ll be the same politics. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be what happens.\u201d On a day that conformed to election campaign stereotype, Swinson cuddled an activist\u2019s baby in Golders Green, donned hi-vis to visit the pharmaceutical firm\u2019s warehouse and ended in the Surrey town of Esher with a visit to a school. The constituency is currently represented by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who enjoys a 23,000 majority, making it a seemingly unlikely Lib Dem prize. Swinson has over recent days declined to say what she would do if, as seems the realistic best-case scenario for her party, it holds the balance of power in a hung parliament after the election. She has categorically ruled out backing either Johnson or Corbyn in Downing Street. Asked if she could hypothetically support a Labour government under a different leader, Swinson said even this did not seem realistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should assume that either of those parties is in any short time frame \u2013 or even ever, who knows \u2013 going to retreat from the more extreme positions that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re built on wishful thinking, about what people would like the Labour party or the Conservative party to return to. It\u2019s not where these parties are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
