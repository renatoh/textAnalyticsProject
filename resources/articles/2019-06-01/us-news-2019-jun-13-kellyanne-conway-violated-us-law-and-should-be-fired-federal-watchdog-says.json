Conway should be removed from federal office, the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announced on Thursday. The watchdog agency made its recommendation after concluding that Conway violated a US law, known as the Hatch Act, that bars government employees from engaging in political campaign activity. In a report addressed to the president, the special counsel\u2019s office identified Conway, long a prominent Trump aide and constantly at his side since he took office while others around him were ousted, as a \u201crepeat offender\u201d of the Hatch Act who has \u201cshown disregard for the law\u201d. \u201cMs Conway\u2019s violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act\u2019s restrictions,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHer actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system: the rule of law.\u201d Last month, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) filed a complaint with the special counsel\u2019s office after Conway attacked 2020 Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 namely former vice-president Joe Biden \u2013 in televised interviews while acting in her official government role. Although the special counsel\u2019s office acts as a federal investigative and prosecutorial agency and typically has great sway, Conway\u2019s fate is in the hands of Trump, her ultimate boss, and he has often singled her out for praise. Trump has also stood by Conway even as her husband, conservative lawyer George Conway, has disparaged him in a series of scathing opinion articles in national publications and on Twitter \u2013 and even called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. White House spokesman Steven Groves swiftly hit back at the report, stating: \u201cThe Office of Special Counsel\u2019s unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process.\u201d \u201cOthers, of all political views, have objected to the OSC\u2019s unclear and unevenly applied rules, which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees,\u201d he added. \u201cIts decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations \u2013 and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s report bears no relation to the work of Robert Mueller, who was specifically appointed in a separate capacity pertaining to the Trump-Russia investigation relating to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The report stated that Conway had run afoul of the Hatch Act on several occasions. In addition to her recent comments about Biden, she sparked similar ethics concerns by advocating for and against candidates in the 2017 Alabama special election. Conway was also forced to apologize after promoting Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line in a TV interview in the early days of the Trump administration. The special counsel\u2019s office criticized Conway for not only continuing to disregard the Hatch Act but also downplaying its significance, stating in an interview last month: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it\u2019s not going to work. Let me know when the jail sentence starts.\u201d Noah Bookbinder, the executive director at Crew, issued a statement on Thursday echoing calls for Conway be dismissed from her role. \u201cConway\u2019s repeated violations and publicly expressed disdain for the law show a dangerous disregard for governmental ethics, the rule of law and the long-held understanding that government officials should not use their official positions to advance partisan politics,\u201d Bookbinder said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
