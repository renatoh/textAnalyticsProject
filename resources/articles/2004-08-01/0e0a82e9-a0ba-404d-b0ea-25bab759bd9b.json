Hunsecker has a way with words; he ruins lives, not least that of his kid sister (Susan Harrison) and her dawning romance. Mackendrick, director of the jolly Whisky Galore, here casts a flickering light on big-city corruption; noir-dark and cynical, with a cool jazz score from Elmer Bernstein and James Wong Howe's cutting-edge photography. As Good As It Gets (James L Brooks, 1997) 8pm, FilmFour Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for this, though their relationship in Brooks's polished, expensive-looking romantic comedy is barely credible. He's a phobically challenged, ultra-fastidious irascible bastard of a writer; she's the waitress at the one restaurant in town that still serves him, and there's a sickly subplot concerning her ailing son (Jesse James). But it's done with consummate professionalism, best turn coming from Simon Bishop as Nicholson's gay neighbour, into whose life the old curmudgeon is drawn, kicking and snarling. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: Collector's Edition (Steven Spielberg, 1977) 8pm, Sky Cinema 1 Featuring the aliens with the five-note musical calling card: and curiously, since this is Spielberg's homage to 50s sci-fi, not a ray-gun in sight. He blew the $20m mega-budget on dazzling special effects, Douglas Trumbull's team creating alien craft of astonishing size and power, and on clever smaller tricks too - such as toys going bonkers when the aliens arrive. A delightful, wide-eyed wonder, despite Richard Dreyfuss's hammy exercise in obsession. The Quiet American (Phillip Noyce, 2002) 10pm, Sky Movies 2 A faithful, politically adept adaptation of Graham Greene's novel about a love-triangle in tense and troubled 1950s Vietnam, in the long, bitter build-up to the 60s war. Michael Caine gives one of his great performances as Fowler, the Times's Saigon correspondent, a study in weary cynicism; Do Thi Hai Yen is his young Vietnamese mistress, and as the mysterious American who crashes in on Fowler's subtle, compromised world, Brendan Fraser's Pyle is a walking, talking embodiment of hamfisted US foreign policy. Solaris (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972) 2.40am, FilmFour Based on the novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem, this cult sci-fi movie was considered the Soviet riposte to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It certainly matches the cerebral scheme of Kubrick's film, although it lacks the visual pyrotechnics. Cosmonaut Donatas Banionis is sent to a space station on the mysterious planet Solaris to investigate why most of the crew have died, and finds the whole planet is a sentient force mirroring human desires. It's a long, slow but hypnotic voyage, recently remade impressively by Steven Soderbergh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
