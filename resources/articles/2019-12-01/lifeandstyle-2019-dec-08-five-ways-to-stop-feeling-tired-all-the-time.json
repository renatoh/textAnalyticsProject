Tiredness is: \u201cI\u2019m lacking energy and concentration, I\u2019m irritable. I\u2019m not motivated.\u201d Sleepiness, however, is: \u201cI am battling to stay awake. When I sit on the bus I\u2019m nodding off.\u201d Sleepiness is usually a sign of a sleep disorder or not getting enough sleep, whereas tiredness could be caused by many things \u2013 stress, pain, anaemia or hormone problems most commonly. If you have concerns about your sleep, Selsick recommends getting specialist help via your GP. Resist box-set temptation The way Selsick sees it: \u201cStaying up for an extra half hour just to watch one more episode of a TV show can leave you feeling tired and rotten for 16 hours of the next day. Whereas that extra 30 minutes of sleep could have you feeling better for 16 hours of the next day. That\u2019s a very good return on investment.\u201d Giving yourself an extra 30 minutes in bed, five nights a week, he says, can make a significant difference. It won\u2019t necessarily happen straight away, he warns, \u201cbecause if you are walking around with a sleep debt, it takes time to pay off that debt\u201d. He recommends trying it consistently for a month, and if you don\u2019t feel any better, then sleep may not be the problem and you need to investigate further. Grownups need bedtime routines, too \u201cAvoid alcohol, nicotine, caffeine and other stimulants before bed and don\u2019t eat large meals late in the evening,\u201d says Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs. Watch your exposure to blue light, too. \u201cWatching TV and using digital devices such as smartphones and tablets can increase alertness. Make sure your bedroom is sleep-friendly: dark, quiet and tidy.\u201d There is good evidence, he says, \u201cthat exercise can reduce stress, which can help with sleep \u2013 but it also gives you energy so avoid doing it for a couple of hours before bed.\u201d Don\u2019t let your phone wake you up Phones buzzing or lighting up during the night are a sleep menace, says Selsick. We all wake up a few times and that is completely normal. \u201cIt\u2019s what stopped our ancestors getting eaten,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wake up, check our environment and go back to sleep. But what we see a lot in the sleep lab is people wake up, and the first thing they do is reach for the phone. It\u2019s keeping them awake for longer periods during the night.\u201d If you are adamant about taking your phone to bed, to use as an alarm clock or in case of emergencies, \u201cideally, the phone should be left charging under your bed so that you\u2019re not tempted to reach for it in the middle of the night\u201d. Eat protein with every meal and snack \u201cDoing so will help to keep your blood sugar balanced,\u201d says the registered nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch, author of Va Va Voom: The 10-Day Energy Diet. \u201cThis will help you avoid the dreaded mid-afternoon energy slump. And foods that are rich in protein also often contain iron, an extra bonus for anyone who is borderline anaemic. Meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds and pulses are all good sources.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
