She was a woman who achieved brilliance in a man's world, an outsider among insiders. But her work has been described as pure evil and she lived at a time and in a country where her talent was focused on one of the most appalling, destructive and repellent regimes in history. By helping to create the Hitler myth, she glorified and celebrated Nazism. She made it acceptable, even desirable, for millions of Germans to go along with Hitler. And in promoting the Nazi leadership, there is a direct line from her infamous Nazi party films to Auschwitz and Belsen. When she heard of Hitler's suicide, she took to her bed and wept. And for nearly 60 years, she tried to deny or obfuscate her role in supporting Nazism. These denials and lies have made it difficult to assess her relationship to the Third Reich. But in Stephen Bach, Leni Riefenstahl has met her match. Bach is the author of, in my view, the best insider account of Hollywood film-making. As head of production for United Artists, Bach oversaw the making of Heaven's Gate, a movie that went so over budget it destroyed UA. He wrote about this in the remarkable Final Cut, accepting his culpability in allowing the excesses of a film-maker to bankrupt a revered Hollywood studio. In Leni, Bach systematically and thoroughly chronicles a life so full of contradictions and denials it almost makes you want to scream. Riefenstahl's attempt to exonerate herself is well matched by Bach's careful investigation. He has, for instance, managed to track down the first film in which a young Leni appears, semi-naked. Later, she denied its existence. But here it is, from 1925, wonderfully titled Ways to Strength and Beauty. Bach then shows that her early dancing career was never the 'unexpected, incomprehensible, unbelievable success' she later maintained it to be. The reviews she quoted for the next 80 years were very partially selected. The phrase she was often heard to utter was: 'I must meet that man.' The men she had to meet all helped her in one way or another. Arnold Fanck, the director of the mountain school of German film-making, was the first to cast Leni in a starring role. She sought out Josef von Sternberg, whom she hoped would help propel her to international fame, but instead he chose Marlene Dietrich. And, ultimately, there was the Fuhrer himself, to whom she wrote adoring letters from 1932 on. Riefenstahl's relationship with Hitler has been at the core of her notoriety and the subject of endless denials by her from 1945. It's clear that she was never his girlfriend or sexual partner, although while the Nazis were in power she quite enjoyed the importance that such accusations implied. What is now abundantly plain, however, is that she really was Hitler's film-maker of choice. It was he who asked her to make the Nuremberg party rally films and the film of the Berlin Olympic Games. Over the decades, Riefenstahl spun out many myths around these films, but Bach provides the irrefutable proof. Whenever she ran up against the vast apparatus of Goebbels's Ministry of Propaganda, she rang Hitler's adjutant, requested an urgent meeting and, without exception, got her way. This gave her a level of independence from the Propaganda Ministry, even precedence over it, that was unique in the Third Reich. But it was an independence that relied upon Leni fulfilling Hitler's ambitions for her films. She claimed she was an artist first and last and had no understanding of politics. Again, Bach shows this to be a sham. She claimed she had nothing against Jews, but blamed Jewish critics for the failure of her first film, The Blue Light, and removed from the credits the names of her Jewish collaborators when the film was rereleased in 1938. Of the often quoted saga of using gypsy forced labour in her film Tiefland in 1940, Bach shows that the contract she entered into with the camp commandant makes clear the terms on which she had access to these 'extras' and that she knew they were going back to (at the very least) an uncertain future 'in the east'. For many years after the war, the accusations of being Hitler's girlfriend returned, this time to haunt her. After several investigations, she suffered a mental collapse in 1948. But she soon recovered and in the Fifties and Sixties resorted to the courts on more than 50 separate occasions to threaten anyone who disagreed with her account of events. Also, as her films began to be used in TV documentaries, she became increasingly litigious in demanding financial payment. In a secret deal with Transit Film, the German government agency used to collect royalties for Nazi-era film and photography, she received revenues from her films up to her death. While denying her Nazi past, she continued to make money from it. In her 60s and 70s, Riefenstahl 'discovered' Africa and produced several popular photo albums of the Nuba people of Sudan. Even here, she gained notoriety, annoying several professional anthropologists by barging in to their space and calling it her own. This is a fine biography and a great read. But there are a few quibbles. Bach never describes clearly the films themselves. Agreed, the key films are now available on DVD, but most readers will only know them from the clips regularly seen in television histories. The lines of uniformed party members, the drums, the flags at Nuremberg. Or Jesse Owens coiled in the starting blocks. But I could have done with more analysis. Her rally films such as Triumph of the Will fascinate as a filmic expression of the fascist ethic. But Olympia is a truly great cinematic achievement. She anticipates much of modern sports filming, from the way she sets up her camera angles around the athletics track to the style of the diving or the rowing coverage. Some of what she and her team invented was 60 years ahead of its time. Bach does little to help the reader understand her filmic prowess. And the book has very extensive notes - nearly 60 pages of them - but bizarrely, there are no footnotes linking the notes to the main text. Why not? What emerges from Bach's biography is a character utterly obsessive in achieving her objective, whether it was to 'meet that man' or to complete a film project or later to clear her name. Anyone or anything that got in her way was seen as purely destructive. Any alternative account was regarded as treachery or libel. And she really did remain resilient to the end. The only thing she regretted about Triumph of the Will was the trouble it had caused her. She sought credit for the art of her films while rejecting any responsibility for their content or that they had in any way endorsed or glorified an evil regime. An artist can never be apolitical or exist outside the political environment in which he or she lives. It's a shame Leni never accepted this and devoted almost 60 years of her life to denying it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
