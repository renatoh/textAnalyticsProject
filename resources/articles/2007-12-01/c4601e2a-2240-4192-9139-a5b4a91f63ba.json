The Gunners reported on Friday that they had 15 players unavailable due to either injury, illness, pregnancy or being out of the country for Christmas. \"We're on the floor here,\" said the manager Vic Akers, whose problems had mounted rapidly after fielding a team only two players short of full strength in the previous Sunday's League Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Arsenal's predicament brought no sympathy from Birmingham's chairman, Steve Shipway, who said angrily: \"This is the sort of thing that happens in a Sunday morning pub league. Arsenal have got a big enough squad to have fulfilled the fixture. As well as costing us money and embarrassment at having to call the game off they've done a great disservice to women's football. \"Apart from the top flight there were no matches being played anywhere, so it was a great opportunity to promote the women's game. We'd mounted a big publicity campaign and were expecting a crowd of at least 600, but I had to spend Friday night and Saturday explaining through local media and emails that we had to call the game off because the European champions couldn't put a team out.\" Shipway reckoned his club would be out of pocket to the tune of around \u00a32,000, and the FA spokesman Alex Stone confirmed: \"Arsenal will be charged with failing to fulfil a fixture and will have to put their case. If they are unsuccessful, sanctions against them could include having to meet any costs incurred by Birmingham.\" While the Gunners were coming under fire their once great rivals, Charlton Athletic, reformed after being disbanded by their parent club in the summer, were receiving high praise after collecting their first goals and first point of the season in a 2-2 draw at Leeds United. Charlton's manager, Paul Mortimer, said: \"The girls were absolutely outstanding and we will now go from strength to strength.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
