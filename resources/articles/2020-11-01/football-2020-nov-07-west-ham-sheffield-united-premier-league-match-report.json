Still 0-0 going into four added minutes, West Ham had time to score a well-worked goal, concede a poor penalty and then watch as Ademola Lookman took a truly awful spot kick to blow Fulham\u2019s chance of a point with the last kick of the match. West Ham move up to 11th with the win, courtesy of Tomas Soucek\u2019s slammed side-foot finish from a Sa\u00efd Benrahma cutback. The new Hammers signing, making his home debut, then nipped at the toe of Tom Cairney in the box with seconds remaining. After a long interaction with VAR a spot-kick was awarded and Lookman stepped up to take. He chipped a Panenka that was so bad it barely had enough power to bounce off the chest of Lukasz Fabianski. There were cheers and laughter, even in an empty stadium. It is tempting to read too much into this result \u2013 and so let\u2019s do that. West Ham\u2019s recent run of exemplary form has come from sticking it to the big boys. Standing tall, playing tough and sticking to a plan. Against Fulham, for long stretches, it looked like something else was required as the visitors \u2013 boosted by their first win of the season, against West Brom on Monday night \u2013 played with confidence and more verve than their opponents. In the end, however, West Ham did find that little extra, when David Moyes brought on Benrahma with around 20 minutes of the match remaining. He replaced Pablo Fornals, who has technical ability, but not the x-factor with the ball at his feet that the Algerian showed for so long with Brentford. Benrahma jinked his way into the area to force a double save with minutes of normal time remaining. Then when the Hammers were given one last opportunity to play their way through the spaces of a retreating Fulham defence, Benrahma found the right touches to let Soucek apply the finish. Moyes expressed solidarity with his opposite number after Scott Parker complained about the lack of an offside call against S\u00e9bastien Haller in the buildup to the goal. \u201cIf I was Scott Parker I\u2019d be really disappointed. I think the whole offside rule, where they\u2019re delaying the flag, it\u2019s a terrible rule\u201a\u201d he said. Despite criticising his team\u2019s play, however, Moyes was pleased with a victory that could teach an important lesson in resilience. \u201cWe stuck at it tonight and got the result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were given a task to win in a different way, we tried but didn\u2019t pass or cross the ball well enough, our buildup was slower than we would have liked and they\u2019re all things we have to improve. Let\u2019s hope this is not the flaky West Ham of old.\u201d For Fulham there were lessons in that dreadful final moment too. Lookman was as bright a light as any in white on the night, but his ability is not always matched by his decision making. This was a charge that could be levelled at others in the team too, Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa a case in point. Both players have the qualities to be valuable weapons in Fulham\u2019s fight against relegation but to make that reality they may need to take a leaf out of the pared-back, efficient West Ham that narrowly edged them out here. \u201cThe boy has made a mistake, that\u2019s clear\u201a\u201d said Parker of Lookman, on loan from RB Leipzig. \u201cYou can miss a penalty, but you can\u2019t miss a penalty like that. He knows that. When you\u2019re young you have to learn quick. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s so raw, my emotions are of disappointment, and anger a bit. Addy is a young player and he\u2019s been fantastic since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019s got to learn from tonight, but he\u2019s not going to hide from that. I\u2019ve not got an issue with missing a penalty, but when you decide to take it like that you put yourself right on show.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
