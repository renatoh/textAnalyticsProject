The broad willingness of the US media to stand behind, or at least reserve criticism of, Bush's war on terrorism and handling of the economy has evaporated over the past week. In a bold fashion, the continuing confusion over who knew what and when about the faulty intelligence has opened a fissure for broader scrutiny and criticism to seep. As Howard Kurtz, the respected media columnist for the Washington Post, noted: 'the Bush White House is on a losing streak'. In one week, the White House has been forced to admit it had made a mistake over the Niger uranium claim - though it didn't take responsibility for it. Then it had to announce that this year's federal budget deficit will soar past $450 billion (and that operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are costing the US taxpayer $5bn a month); and weather daily troop casualties and the admission that American forces in Iraq are facing an organised and sustained guerrilla war. On Friday, the White House conceded it had failed in its efforts to 'move on' from 'Uraniumgate' and the specifics of suspect pre-war intelligence. And it is the prism through which larger issues of the administration's performance and trustworthiness are now being scrutinised. 'The press, like the Democrats, have been in a somnambulistic trance,' says Vanity Fair's James Wolcott. 'Now they have woken up and are asking, \"What's being going on?\" They only have themselves to blame, but at least there is now a different dynamic at work.' But, adds Wolcott: 'It's typical of the press to be seizing upon the uranium when, in fact, there are so many inconsistencies to chose from. It's happening now because of two things Bush has no control over: the casualty figures coming out of Iraq and the unemployment numbers.' Nominally neutral press organisations such as CNN are now asking their viewers the pointed question: 'Did Bush lie over the issue of WMDs?' It is the first time during the life of this administration that the two words 'Bush' and 'lie' have come into such close and public proximity. 'There's no question that, for the first time in a long time, the press is giving the President a much harder reception,' says Kurtz. 'There's something about this uranium story that seems to have ignited the dormant investigative fires in the American media. 'It's much harder to raise questions about a President's general credibility than it is to yank on the threads of an obvious screw-up. This bogus uranium story has become a kind of metaphor for the administration's larger credibility problems and that, along with its clumsy handling of the controversy, is what is fuelling the press scrutiny.' Some commentators, such as the Post's David Broder, venture that as the Bush re-election campaign begins, the events of the past week have raised the tantalising notion among Democrats that Bush could be beaten in the election: 'If President Bush is not re-elected, we may look back on Thursday 10 July, 2003, as the day the shadow of defeat first crossed his political horizon.' Others have been bolder, seeking to make a connection between Bill Clinton lying about sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky and Bush lying to lead the nation into war. Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer has gone so far as to use the 'I' word, declaring 'the firm basis for bringing a charge of impeachment against the President who employed lies to lead us into war'. Political commentary magazines, such as The New Republic, which broke with the Left and supported the war, have returned to the anti-war fold. 'If things were going fine in Iraq the uranium story would have much less resonance with the press and the public,' says Kurtz. 'But because things seem to be falling apart there, and the continuing American deaths, it has caused a re-appraisal of the whole case for war that Bush made.' On cable TV news channels the issue of Iraq, which largely dropped from prominence as soon as Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Baghdad, has returned as fodder for commentators to debate. Those against the war, routinely abused before it started, are no longer being treated with the same disdain; pro-Bush factions are becoming more intemperate. 'The pro-Bush team are confused,' says Wolcott. 'They're still hoping a rabbit is going to be pulled out of the hat. That's their article of faith. It's like a kid saying, \"Is Santa Claus really coming?\" He's found all these weapons [and] he's going to bring them down the chimney.' The US media's new and feisty attitude toward the administration owes much to the reinvigoration of the democratic opposition. In the run-up to the war, opposition leaders fell in behind the President, offering the press littlefriction to exploit. With the emergence of Howard Dean and other Democrats who have found their voice on post-war issues, 'it's an easier story for them to jump on', says Kurtz. Part of the shift in temperament can also be ascribed to the diminishing power of 11 September as justification, says Wolcott. 'The administration can no longer use 9/11 to say this is why we have to do this. They've used it again and again, but it's no longer working.' Others say that the media has yet to commit itself to fully taking on the administration. Bush's falling poll numbers are not yet definitive, and many Americans are still willing to believe that weapons of mass destruction could be still found. 'We're at a taking-the-temperature moment,' says New York magazine's Michael Wolff. 'And there's still a sense in the media that these guys always pull something out of the bag. We're in a moment when the media is trying to figure out which way the wind is blowing. 'There has been a shift, but not an open break. The real issue now is no longer uranium but the grinding, inexorable pace of America getting deeper into a very bad situation in Iraq, so everyone is anticipating the possibility that things are going to begin to tumble.' But the new line - 'It was worth it if it works' - is not going get the administration off the hook, predicts Wolcott: 'It's too far gone now. The American people are going to say, \"You didn't tell us we were going into Iraq to build a better society for them\" and I think Dick Morris is right when he says the worst thing Bush can do now is take his month-long holiday in Texas. It will leave the Democrats an entire month to fill the void.' Some news organisations are already running the picture of Bush from his Top Gun fly-boy entrance on to the aircraft carrier in May and announcing 'Mission Accomplished' against the mounting casualty figures. As Gore Vidal once said: 'Our old friend hubris is back in town.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
