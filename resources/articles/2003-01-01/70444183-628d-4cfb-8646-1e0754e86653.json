Professor Jo Silvester, of Goldsmiths College, University of London, has helped the party draw up a new selection process, which aims to improve its meagre share of female MPs. A report on the recruitment of women, co-authored by Professor Silvester and the Tories' director of candidates, Christina Dykes, was discussed today at the annual occupational conference of the British Psychological Society in Bournemouth. Competency-based assessments, rating applicants on criteria such as communication and intellectual skills as well as political conviction, have been introduced for all the party's parliamentary hopefuls, as part of a review of selection procedures. Women account for just 18% of all members of parliament and represent only 8% of Tory MPs, but there has been mixed support for measures such as all-women shortlists. The Tories claim their move has led to more women progressing further through the selection process, with the result that nine Tory women have been selected as prospective parliamentary candidates compared to a total of three at this stage in the run-up to the last election. The party has maintained that all-women shortlists are not the way forward, with Iain Duncan Smith ruling them out as recently as last month. Professor Silvester said in the report that some positive action strategies could support a \"damaging belief\" that women needed help in order to succeed in politics. \"This perception that women are somehow not as good as their male counterparts is problematic for women,\" she said. \"There is considerable evidence that when women are assessed for leadership positions using selection procedures based on an objective analysis of the skills necessary to perform a role, using a rigorous and fair selection process, they perform just as well as men. \"Unfortunately, political selection procedures to date have not operated in this way.\" Ms Dykes said the party realised it had to bring its assessment process up to date in the hope of encouraging more people to come forward. \"For some time I've been concerned about a lack of diversity in the party. There are many reasons for this but one of them is the selection process. \"We had to update the old system because the role of MP has changed in the last 30 years. Then you might have thought debate in the chamber was very important. Today you might think constituency work is very important.\" But the party is not aiming to boost women's representation to 50% in the long term. \"Women won't ever come forward in the same numbers as men,\" Ms Dykes said. Women's \"lifestyles and employment styles\" were to blame for this, she said, as well as the selection process and working practices at Westminster. But she dismissed the introduction of all-female selection lists as necessarily involving \"negative discrimination\" for others. \"At the end of the day, we need to ensure the most competent people are in place.\" The Conservative party chairwoman, Theresa May, described the move as \"a bold and innovative approach\", which \"shows how serious we are in making sure our candidates have the skills needed to be good members of parliament. \"This sends a clear message that becoming a candidate in our party is not about decisions taken by grey suits behind closed doors. It is about proper rigorous assessment of people's capabilities and skills,\" she said. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, welcomed the new measures but expressed concern at the pace of change. \"It is very encouraging to see that the Conservative party is exploring ways to increase the representation of women at Westminster,\" a spokeswoman said. \"It is vital that equal opportunities practices are properly incorporated into the selection procedure for parliamentary candidates in order to create a level playing field for women. There is overwhelming evidence that the quality of female candidates is as high as that of their male counterparts. \"Fawcett believes that positive action, such as all women shortlists, is needed not because female candidates are in any way inferior, but in order to expedite the election of more women MPs. \"At the current rate, it will take over 300 years for Conservative women to reach parity with their male colleagues, which is clearly unacceptable.\" Labour has stated it aims to achieve 35% of women MPs in each English and Welsh region at the next election, but this depends on sufficient male candidates stepping down in safe seats. The Labour party used all-women selection lists during the 1997 election, achieving a 25% female share of its elected MPs. This slipped back to 23% in 2001, when positive discrimination was not used."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
