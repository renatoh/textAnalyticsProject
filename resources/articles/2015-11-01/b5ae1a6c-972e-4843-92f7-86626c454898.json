Although the Spanish forward is widely admired, Newcastle United\u2019s manager wants to see clear evidence of the 22-year-old starting to fulfil his promise on a consistent basis before advising the St James\u2019 Park hierarchy to draft a new, improved deal. With Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur among the clubs watching P\u00e9rez on a regular basis it may appear a somewhat laid-back attitude. However, he signed a long-term agreement \u2013 Newcastle have never specified its precise length \u2013 when he joined from Tenerife 18 months ago and McClaren feels there is no immediate need to extend it. \u201cAyoze is someone who is doing very well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he\u2019s under contract for a long while, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue at the moment. He came here as a player with potential and played a little bit last season. \u201cIt\u2019s taken him a while to get going this season but he\u2019s certainly become an important player. I look at him, though, and he\u2019s still got a long way to go. The potential is massive but there\u2019s a lot to do. He\u2019s got to do it consistently, every game, for 95 minutes. That\u2019s what we\u2019re asking.\u201d McClaren accepts Newcastle could face tempting bids for P\u00e9rez in January but believes the forward should stay put. \u201cWe\u2019ll only know we\u2019ve held on to our best players by the end of January,\u201d he acknowledged before Leicester City\u2019s visit on Saturday. \u201cBut Ayoze\u2019s career is definitely best served here. \u201cHe\u2019s getting development, a good education, the right training and most important of all, he\u2019s playing. It\u2019s important he keeps playing and it\u2019s also important that he\u2019s supported and loved. Here the fans love him, his team-mates love him and we love him too. It\u2019s a great environment for Ayoze to develop in. \u201cHe has forced his way into my team. When I first came, I didn\u2019t know a lot about him. There were other players in a similar position who I knew a lot more about. Ayoze had limited opportunities in pre-season but he stuck at it, kept going and forced his way into things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
