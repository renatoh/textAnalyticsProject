What a Lovely War", "bodyText": "A prophet without honour in her own country, Joan Littlewood was one of the great director/dramaturgs of the 20th century, as this timely and stunningly presented revival of her musical hit shows. Oh! What A Lovely War is a theatrical Verey light by whose glare the people-pulping mechanisms of power are starkly exhibited. Polemic it is not, though it deploys the agitprop and living-newspaper techniques of political theatre. Entertaining it is, as if a commedia troupe with a music hall repertoire had been asked to deliver a lesson on the mayhem of the 1914-18 war. Joint directors Erica Whyman and Sam Kenyon have assembled a company of traditional actors and improvisational comedians who meet the not inconsiderable demands of this sprawling show with skill and aplomb. On a bare stage scattered with stepladders, boxes and musical instruments, they kaleidoscope battlefields and ballrooms, streetcorners and cafes (aided by Charles Balfour's impossibly evocative lighting). Above them, coloured lights flash terrible statistics: \"850,000 dead\"; \"300,000 casualties August\". It's tough work for the audience, putting this all together (sometimes made harder by fake-foreign-accent mumbling), but that's the point: we must decide for ourselves \u2013 just how lovely is war?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
