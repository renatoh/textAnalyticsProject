I would disagree with some aspects of this article (Security breakdown, January 17), but I've always wondered how long the goodwill and openness of the vulnerability/disclosure community with vendors would last. corqspy.org Money better spent Michael Cross is quite right in his thesis - the government and the regulator have ignored those who, for the past few years, have been pointing with increasing urgency to the looming gap between the underlying need and the studied lack of provision (We need vision for next-generation broadband, January 17). However, while it's usual to present that gap in terms of a social divide, there is another concern that is arguably much more important. Unless UK businesses can get access to real, affordable, reliable broadband, where and when they want it, our economy will suffer in comparison with our competitors. But we still lack a national policy. The cost of a national fibre access network has been estimated at \u00a315bn; a sum of the same order as the cost of Crossrail or the Olympics. Yet the long-term public good resulting from a fibre network would be immeasurably greater than either of those projects. David Harrington, Communications Managers Association Scrabbling for a result Hasbro/Mattel dropped the ball (Newly Asked Questions, January 17). Some other random Indian guys picked it up.

Sure, these developers are making some ad revenue money based on a game with a marketing plan long financed by Hasbro ... but surely Hasbro can pay these guys some R&amp;D money for striking oil where they weren't even drilling. vbernal.blogspot.com Measuring a Macbook Air You report that \"Steve Jobs has unveiled the Macbook Air, which is just three quarters of an inch deep\". Now, I'm nearly 30 and I have no concept of what three quarters of an inch is. Perhaps it might be better to use 1.94cm, as Apple's website does. Or \"just under 2cm\". We went metric in the 70s! Jennifer Marshall, Birmingham Peace, love and Linux I've been wondering when something like this was going to happen - actually, I was thinking it would have been one of the Nordic countries (Can Linux finally unite Korea?, January 17). The power of an entire country moving to a free Linux OS will have an enormous effect on the Windows platform. deancollinsblog.blogspot.com Peace, love, and Linux? Maybe. Maybe not. But it's very cool to see the two governments collaborating on IT, if little else. blogs.cnet.com The right answers What licence you can obtain from OPSI [the Office of Public Sector Information] for PSI [public sector information] depends on two things. 1) Whether the information was collected as part of core government activities and 2) whether you are a commercial entity (Free Our Data, January 17). The licence is only freely reusable if the answers are yes and no. wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/downing Fishier chips I raised an eyebrow when I received an unexpected reminder of my pin for a defective credit card. I share Matt Langley's concern (Letters, January 10). The banks and credit card suppliers need to improve their security procedures and stop blaming customers every time something goes wrong.
