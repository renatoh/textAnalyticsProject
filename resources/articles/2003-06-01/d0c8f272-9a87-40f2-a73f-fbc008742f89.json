Indeed many felt that from the moment the US president arrived at the scene, expressed himself delighted to be in \"Manchestershire\", greeted Sir Alex Ferguson with the words: \"Didn't you used to be a fat dame? Where's all your red hair gone?\" before going on to inquire after the health of the \"Dukemeister of Yorkiedom\" attempts to bring a lasting resolution to the conflict in the Old Trafford dressing room were doomed. The president, we were reassured, had little time for detail, preferring to look at the big picture and work in broad strokes. Unfortunately on this occasion he had forgotten his wax crayons with the result that all week the newspapers have been filled with horrifying images (insert your own Posh Spice joke here). Tony Blair has remained strangely silent on the matter. This is a great puzzle since it is well known that the Prime Minister has been a fan of Beckham's ever since, as a wee bairn, he travelled to N'casle to watch him make his debut for Blackpool in the 1958 FA Cup final. It is believed the PM's reticence is due to a heavy workload. Impressed with the success of Florentino Perez at Real Madrid and now the showing of Joan Laporta at the Camp Nou, it is believed Blair is plotting a La Liga-style approach to the next general election, ditching all references to boring old rubbish like the NHS and the Euro in favour of a firm pledge that, if re-elected, he will bring Anna Kournikova and George Clooney to Britain. According to spin chief and former Zimbabwe cricket captain Alistair Campbell, Blair will make a great play of the fact that first time around he \"delivered the dream ticket of Madonna and Ruud Gullitt\". Responding to what he called, \"A, like, totally square idea,\" the Conservative leader Ian Duncan Smith said: \"There is no way I will enter into this sort of childish nonsense, even though I know I could get far better people than him - Cary Grant, Little Mo Connolly and Garrincha, for example. Luckily the general election is not a popularity contest. Pardon? Are you sure? Oh bugger, that's me duffed then\". Meanwhile it has been alleged that throughout the past season Beckham has been using his hairstyles to send messages to would-be purchasers. Professor Stan Lugg, chairman of Follicle Semiotics at the University of Barnet, claims that the England captain's frequent visits to the barbers have less to do with fashion than with communication. \"Some people say that Beckham has been using colour to signal his intentions, but that is rubbish,\" Professor Lugg said. \"Anybody who has studied my highly influential books and papers such as Bucks Frizz - Kevin Keegan's Perm as Signifier of Economic Uncertainty 1974-78 knows that the Magnificent 7 has always been hyper-aware when it comes to the importance of the scalp as an primary or tertiary indicator. Indeed I wouldn't be surprised if he has studied Umberto Eco's playful yet profound essay, Say It With Flowers, Semaphore It With Hair! and I'm almost sure he's tried to get his nicely coiffed head around Foucault's dictum, but frankly that's a rather dubious double entendre that I don't feel a senior academic such as myself should be pursuing in a family newspaper, even when I'm being paid by the word.\" \"So what has Beckham been saying?\" asks the professor. \"Well, lately he's been wearing a style known as the Victorian ponytail. The Victoria(n) angle is a simple proclamation of devotion to his wife obviously, but if that was all he wanted to say he would surely have opted for something easier such as an old mullet. Instead he has gone for the ponytail. Now, when we think of ponytails we immediately think of horses. And what could be more synonymous with horses than the famous Spanish Riding School? It's a clear message: 'Serie A? No, Grazie'.\" \"Now some people may say: 'But hang on, Prof, the Spanish Riding School is in Austria.' However, I think we can safely rule out the idea of the England captain sending an 'End my Old Trafford hell!' plea to Admira M\u00f6dling. \"And so we come to the real crunch hairstyle. The one that gives us the clearest and most precise indication of the way Beckham wants his career to play out in the next month - the use of the Alice band. Think of an Alice who's in a band; Alice Cooper, of course! And in 1972 Alice Cooper had a top 10 hit with (I Wanna Be) Elected. Who is trying to be elected at the moment? Joan Laporta of Barcelona. So it's clear to me that what David has been saying with his hair is: 'I want to start next season in the red and blue of Barca'. \"Of course what he has been saying with his mouth is quite the opposite, but that's his problem. That will be \u00a3525.49 plus VAT. Do you need an invoice?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
