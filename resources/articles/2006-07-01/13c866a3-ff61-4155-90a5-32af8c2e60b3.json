If the presence of hills is not it, what makes a great climber and who is of this ilk today? Jonathan Vincent by email Sean Yates Yes, it's true that a lot of the best climbers have not come from mountainous areas. Lucien van Impe and Peter Winnen were from Belgium, for example, and Steven Rooks, Gert-Jan Theunisse and Hennie Kuiper were from the Netherlands. Those are just a few of the great climbing names that spring to mind. Going uphill fast is a question of having a good watts (of power) to kilograms (of weight) ratio. There are a few pure climbers in the bunch today but they don't really seem to be able to make the difference on the mountains like they did in the past. Why have Britain and Ireland produced so many good track cyclists but so few who are able to challenge for the major road races? Hugo Berry Chiswick The UK has had great results on the track in recent years because it has developed a great set-up where, with the help of funding, the riders can live like pros. They have all the back-up and advice they need. This is not the case for many of their rivals. Another reason is that all the best cyclists are riding the road, were the real money is. We have had a couple of riders who have made the transition, but it's not easy. There seem to have been a lot of crashes in this year's Tour de France. Is the race getting more dangerous? Russell Dunham Southend I would disagree. OK, there have been a couple of bad ones but on the whole there have been very few. In fact, on the first stage there was not one, which I think must be some kind of record. Obviously crashes occur when the riders are getting tired and are not able to concentrate 100%. I'm not saying they are not tired, but the bunch being smaller from the start this year has made a difference. Have team radios taken some of the individuality and spontaneity out of the Tour? Tim Hemming Stockton-on-Tees Yes. I believe radios have changed everything, that along with televisions in the team cars they mean that the directors can control everything going on in the race. All the rider has to do is pedal and do as he is told. The riders do, however, have to use their heads when the breaks are being formed, so that they know who is going up the road and who is not. But when the race has formed, that's when the radios really come in. You are assistant directeur sportif for Lance Armstrong's Discovery Team - is his absence being felt this year? Chas Neale Spennymoor The fact that Lance is no longer with the team has changed a lot within the organisation, the most obvious being the lack of people around the team bus before and after the races. It's nice in a way to be left alone but it's also nice to be the centre of attention. Lance not being here also means that we have to find someone else to win the bike races, and that's not easy. Not least because he is irreplaceable. Next week Colin Jackson 110m hurdles great.
