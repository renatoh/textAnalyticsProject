But it isn't the questioner who gets gored. Yeah, says Ackroyd, \"that's the one that the editor takes out.\" This was the only moment of potential awkwardness in the debut last night of BBC4's Readers and Writers Roadshow, in which Ackroyd, historical novelist Tracy Chevalier and historian Jerry Brotton responded intelligently and engagingly to promptings from an audience in Colchester, discussing how writers imagine the past, the way medieval or Renaissance people seem both close to us and very distant, and whether linear time is a straitjacket for historians and biographers that fiction writers can gleefully escape from. Anyone who has attended literary festivals will be familiar with such Q&amp;A sessions, so it's easy to miss how boldly the Roadshow jettisons received ideas governing the way TV covers books. For more than four decades, it has been unthinkable that an anonymous man from Essex should be allowed to lob innocuous queries (let alone criticisms) at the likes of Ackroyd. Staggeringly, novelist and Orange Prize co-founder Kate Mosse is the first woman ever to present a regular BBC television books show; and, as she says, previous series all too often \"seemed like a small group of people talking to each other\". The pattern Mosse describes was first set by John Freeman's cross-examinations of Evelyn Waugh and Edith Sitwell in Face to Face (1959-62), and was taken up by general arts magazine programmes with schoolmasterly presenters and tellingly Latinate names - Monitor and Omnibus on the BBC, Tempo on ITV. No dedicated series established itself until the BBC's inventively titled The Book Programme (1973-81) was launched, inaugurating a long era in which it was axiomatic that Robert Robinson's stone-faced demeanour, comb-over hairstyle and 18th-century way with a sentence were vital to any TV literary project. Lion-bagging remained the show's main objective (Robinson's biggest coup was an interview with Nabokov, who read hidden prepared responses), and highbrow authors its focus. By contrast, in Read All About It (1976-78), Melvyn Bragg chaired a panel of literati and media types reviewing the latest paperbacks. With its unprecedented acknowledgement of the market and the consumer, this can be seen as a precursor of the Roadshow . But its tentative shift towards readers (albeit famous or semi-famous ones) proved short-lived, as the series folded once Bragg left to set up The South Bank Show. Channel 4's arrival prompted a BBC rethink, and the newcomer's Book Four, fronted by Hermione Lee, was answered in 1983 by Bookmark, initially a studio magazine. But it never found an anchor with any gift for drawing guests out. The BBC eventually revamped the series as a strand for book-related films. Books coverage in the 1990s was a less fusty re-run of the 1960s. Once again authors were either f\u00eated in lengthy profiles or squeezed into the motley menu of all-arts magazine series (The Late Show and its various spin-offs) catering for viewers who were not necessarily great readers. Televised Booker banquets reinforced the impression of an exclusive metropolitan club. The press material for Channel 4's Booked, presented by David Aaronovitch with regular guest Nigella Lawson, said it would steer clear of the \"consumer or publishing-led approach to the world of books\". Only BBC1's The Bookworm, produced by Daisy Goodwin and presented by Griff Rhys Jones, defied the zeitgeist. In two respects it can be seen as the Roadshow 's forerunner: it moved from town to town, and it incorporated the views of readers who were not celebrities, writers or academics. Elsewhere, the intelligentsia continued to talk to one another, but the rationale for this time-honoured elitism was increasingly questionable. For writers were no longer the stunned wild creatures in the headlights of the black-and-white telly era, unused to insolent probings and so needing the soothing presence of a chap from their own caste. Thanks to the burgeoning of publicity tours, bookshop readings and literary festivals, most had become proficient and willing public performers, while bookworms were practised at shouting questions at them. Some writers now show signs of actually preferring scattergun inquiries from fans to being grilled by bookish TV stars. Capitalising on these developments, the Roadshow combines elements of a festival session and a reading group, like Radio 4's Book Club. \"We took the format of a live literary event,\" explains producer Richard Shaw, \"which usually involves a reading, discussion, audience questions and book-signing, and decided to focus on the two middle bits of that.\" And this audience, many of whom are local students, booksellers or members of reading groups, know their stuff. Over the next 12 months, the Roadshow will tour the UK, hopping from festival to festival but also visiting the country's furthest fringes. Shaw enthuses, too, about varying its format, with occasional single-author sessions - Joanna Trollope, Ian Rankin - and adventurously mixed panels. Mosse's extensive experience of chairing festival sessions, he says, made her a natural choice. It says much for her confidence as a first-time presenter that she was ready to act just as conversational traffic cop for most of last night's programme, taking over the questioning only in the final moments. However, the show's fluent assurance made its 30-minute running-time - half or a third of a typical festival event's length, providing scope only for seven audience questions - all the more frustrating. This is not, after all, a series fighting for room against cartoons, sitcoms, cooks, gardeners, roadhogs and fashionistas; BBC4 is a specialist cultural channel whose slogan is \"everyone needs a place to think\". They just shouldn't spend too long there, apparently. \u00b7 The Readers and Writers Roadshow is on BBC4 on Fridays at 8.30pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
