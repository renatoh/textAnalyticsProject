She is very much \"live\" on this disc, however, which was taped at La Scala in Milan on the occasion of her debut recital and retains the extended, often hysterical applause that erupts at the end of each number. As always, she arouses mixed feelings. Whatever you think of Gheorghiu herself, there is little doubt that her voice, with its dark, liquid tones, is remarkable. The problem here is that the programme - Italian, French and Romanian songs - is on the safe side. Everything is graciously done, but there is little to challenge her vocally, and consequently not that much excitement. Her emotional repertoire, in this instance, is limited to charm and melancholy - and we know her to be capable of considerably more than that. Her pianist, Jeff Cohen, is occasionally over-demonstrative, making the Romanian songs sound like Schumann and attacking Verdi as if he were Liszt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
