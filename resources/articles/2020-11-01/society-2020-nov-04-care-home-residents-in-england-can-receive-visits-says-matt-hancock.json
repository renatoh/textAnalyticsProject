When England goes into a month of new restrictions from midnight, care homes must allow residents to receive visits \u201cin a Covid-secure way\u201d using social distancing and protective equipment, new guidance will say. The move came as Hancock admitted it has been \u201cheartbreaking\u201d for families not to see loved ones. Less than three weeks ago the government had said visiting should be stopped in areas with tier 2 and tier 3 lockdown restrictions, apart from in exceptional circumstances such as the end of life. Just eight hours before the lockdown was due to begin, the Department of Health and Social Care said care homes will be given a set of \u201cclear principles for how visits are conducted \u2013 with arrangements to be adapted from home to home, based on residents\u2019 needs and accounting for care homes\u2019 varying layouts and facilities\u201d. These could include Covid-secure visiting areas or pods with floor-to-ceiling screens and windows that don\u2019t require visitors to enter the main body of the care home, the DHSC said. This drew a furious response from the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, which dismissed the idea of \u201cprison-style screens \u2026 with people speaking through phones\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cSomeone with advanced dementia can often be bed-bound and struggling to speak,\u201d said Kate Lee, the chief executive at the charity. \u201cThey won\u2019t understand and will be distressed by what\u2019s going on around them.\u201d She said the government was making a \u201cnaive assumption\u201d that care homes have the resources, space or time to build screens. She questioned what science the policy was based on, claiming there is \u201cno evidence of visits causing transmission\u201d. Other suggestions in the yet-to-be-published guidelines include window visits or the visitor staying in their car and the resident being brought out to see them. Care homes, relatives\u2019 groups and charities including Age UK and Alzheimer\u2019s Society had warned the blanket ban was causing emotional anguish and early deaths as residents were left for months without seeing or holding loved ones, effectively \u201cimprisoned\u201d. Pressure on ministers to act grew on Tuesday, when the Guardian reported that a senior high court judge had ruled that despite the government\u2019s guidelines it was legal for families to visit their loved ones in care homes. Age UK welcomed the acknowledgment of the need to balance infection control against the mental health of care home residents, but warned the new guidelines may backfire. The charity said many care homes in areas of low infection that had been managing some visits may now halt them if they cannot meet the new national requirements. \u201cWe are also acutely aware that the methods of visiting being sanctioned are unlikely to be usable by many older people with dementia, or indeed sensory loss,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s director. The DHSC said it will also launch a pilot of testing care home visitors later this month after the care minister, Helen Whately, said planning for such a system was under way on 13 October. Matt Hancock said: \u201cCare homes should feel empowered by this new guidance to look at safe options to allow visits to care homes that suit their residents and facilities. It is vital high quality, compassionate care and infection control remains at the heart of every single care home to protect staff and residents\u2019 lives, but we must allow families to reunite in the safest way possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
