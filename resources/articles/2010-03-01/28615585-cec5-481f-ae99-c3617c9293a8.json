Ferguson, reeling from the news that Owen needs an operation, was incensed that Rooney defied him by not pulling out of England's midweek defeat of Egypt and has made his feelings plain to the player, accusing him of being irresponsible and jeopardising United's chances of silverware. Ferguson had been led to believe Rooney would withdraw because of a knee injury that has troubled him for several weeks. Instead, the forward played 86 minutes of the 3-1 win, whereas Chelsea's Frank Lampard was replaced at half-time. Rooney's knee has swollen, making him doubtful for United's game at Wolverhampton Wanderers tomorrow, and it is a measure of Ferguson's irritation that he abandoned his usual policy of never criticising players in public. \"I was disappointed with Wayne,\" Ferguson said. \"He didn't come off, I couldn't believe it, and now he's a doubt. We're going to have to assess him because he played virtually the full game for England, which I am disappointed about. Playing at Wembley on that kind of pitch for almost an hour [in the Carling Cup final] on Sunday, and then almost the full 90 minutes on Wednesday, it's far too much. Wayne is exhausted.\" A long-term critic of international friendlies, Ferguson went on to describe the pitch as \"a ploughed field\" and blamed the surface for Owen suffering the injury that has brought his season to a juddering halt. When Rooney reported back for training Ferguson reminded him that United should be his top priority and demanded to know why the player had not signalled to the England manager, Fabio Capello, that he wanted to be substituted. \"There were changes made and I thought Rooney would be one of them,\" Ferguson said. \"It's disappointing. I don't blame Fabio at all, but don't forget he [Rooney] was not supposed to be playing at all. That's what Wayne told us on Sunday because he was feeling his knee. Then all of a sudden you press get hold of him, and people put an arm round his shoulder with England, and he wants to play. He went into the game with an injury and I don't think he should have played but his own enthusiasm has caused it. He can't say no, that's his problem.\" With 28 goals already, it is obvious why Ferguson is desperate to protect Rooney, particularly as Owen's absence limits the club's attacking options, with Federico Macheda having regressed since last season and Daniel Welbeck on loan at Preston North End. Dimitar Berbatov's form has been erratic and Ferguson confirmed the Bulgarian may need an operation at the end of the season due to a knee problem. Mame Biram Diouf is new to English football after signing from Molde in January. Owen damaged his hamstring in the Carling Cup final and what was thought to be a slight pull is actually a full tear, meaning the 30-year-old will undergo surgery on Monday. Ferguson described it as a \"terrible blow\", one that ends any hope the former England player had of being recalled by Capello for the World Cup. \"Unfortunately the specialist says I will miss the end of the season,\" Owen said. \"I have loved every minute of my first campaign with Manchester United and have already enjoyed some memorable moments. I am determined to come back at the start of next season in peak condition.\" Owen's misfortune increases the scrutiny on the Wembley pitch and Ferguson was unsparing in his criticisms. \"I thought a horse show had been on it. Do you remember when Arsenal played Swindon back in the 1960s in the League Cup final? It wasn't as bad as that [on Sunday] but it reminded me of a ploughed field. I couldn't believe that the players had come through it. It was end to end and it does take it out of you.\" That last line was delivered, more forcibly, when he spoke to Rooney. \"It's hard to quell people with his kind of enthusiasm because it's a restless energy,\" Ferguson continued. \"That's his problem. He can't sit down, he can't sit still, he's always on the move. Even in hotels I watch him and he's moving from one table to another.When we're away in Europe, he's walking about, he's always on the go all the time. He's got a restless energy which you don't want to take away from him, but age does some good things for you. Eventually you say to yourself, 'I can't be bothered with all this running about all the time', and you take a rest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
