When I first took over the role, while Lisa Bachelor was on leave, and in the process turning the column from Bachelor and Brignall into Brignall and King, I felt as though I was being thrown to the wolves. Despite nearly 15 years' experience writing about personal finance and investment I wasn't fully prepared to tackle the staggering levels of incompetence, administrative errors and nigh-on criminal behaviour at companies across the UK. I quickly learned. My first reader issue involved Debenhams delivering the wrong table to a customer in London and resulted in a \u00a3700 refund and a \u00a375 apology. The last problem I tackled concerned Admiral car insurance and resulted in a reader having her no-claims bonus reinstated and being reimbursed the \u00a3350 excess she had paid on a policy that had yet to pay out. In between, memorable results included Alliance &amp; Leicester recovering a missing \u00a346,000; Travelodge refunding an extraordinary \u00a3695 charge for non-existent damage done to a hotel room, and Barclays finally calling the debt collectors off an elderly couple and adding a goodwill gesture of \u00a3400. It's not always easy. Few companies are happy to admit wrongdoing, but in my experience the smaller firms are worse than the high street names. There was the time a small business owner screamed at me down the phone using the type of language I first encountered reading Chaucer's Canterbury Tales at school. I have also lost count of the number of times I have been threatened with legal action \u2013 threats rarely followed up. Some of the bigger companies now employ dedicated press officers whose job is to deal with consumer complaints that arrive via the media. This is either an indication of the willingness of big brands to solve problems quickly and help address areas of their business that are failing, or a worrying sign of major ongoing customer service issues at UK plc. We try to be fair. I always give a company the chance to explain what happened and put across its side of the story \u2013 after all, we only have the reader's word for what took place and occasionally readers have failed to reveal the whole story or have tweaked and fabricated their own actions or that of the company. I also try not to name individual customer service employees, even if they have performed poorly. I don't want anyone to lose their job or face public ridicule as a direct result of something I've written, even if they deserve it. We all have off days, after all. But at times I fear for consumers. Some large firms appeared in my inbox so much it was concerning: Santander, Barclays, British Gas, Homeserve, Orange, Vodafone, BT, PayPal, TalkTalk and Expedia to mention but a few. Online-only retailers have proved to be a real problem. Rarely a day passes without someone contacting us about an online outfit I've never heard of that has either failed to deliver an order, failed to refund customers for an order that is now out of stock (was it ever in stock?), or simply vanished. Consumer champions aren't superheroes. As much as we like to give the impression that we strut around the office wearing spandex and a cape, the reality is that we often need assistance. I've had to enlist the help of lawyers to solve tricky legal issues, while the likes of the Office of Fair Trading, the Trading Standards Institute and other consumer rights organisations have offered assistance. Readers are generally thankful if we solve a problem for them, particularly if we recover large sums of money or get debt collectors off their backs. There have only been a handful of occasions when I have helped a reader obtain some form of redress and not even been thanked. More frequent are the abusive emails from readers who have sent in problems we have been unable to even attempt to answer due to the overwhelming number we receive. So how should you complain? I'm now standing down but my colleagues Miles Brignall and Lisa Bachelor agree: a short email summarising the problem, including all the salient points and facts, is best. By all means include a supplementary sheet or two (a timeline of events can be helpful, including dates and times of telephone calls) but keep it snappy. Be honest: there's no point telling us a story you know isn't true because you think it makes your case more compelling. If a complaints process is listed on a company's website, follow it to ensure you are dealt with quickly rather than ignored. Unsuccessful letters, in my experience, include anything with excessively emotive or aggressive language (as my mum always taught me, once you swear you've lost the argument), as well as long letters containing bone-wearyingly detailed, unbroken paragraphs stretching for page after page. Anyone complaining to me about an incident that occurred the day before, without giving the company a chance to rectify it first, would also be ignored. Equally, someone who has exhausted not only a company's internal complaints procedure but has also been unsuccessful with an ombudsman (as well as, in some cases, the courts) is unlikely to get much joy from contacting us \u2013 an organisation that has already been told it has acted legally and fairly won't change its mind because we ask them to. I'm also not a fan of readers who are \"incredibly outraged\" at minor incidents. And please, include a contact number or at least check your emails \u2013 there have been many instances where I've asked a reader for the details I need to take on their case without ever getting a response. Of course, it shouldn't have to be like this. I recognise mistakes will be made, but companies of any size should not have such poor customer service set-ups that tired and sometimes tearful customers have no choice but to contact the media. If consumers had greater protection, I'm sure consumer champions across the country would gladly stand down. So what has a year working as a consumer champion taught me about consumer rights? What would my wishlist be? I would like to see consumer law tweaked so all hidden charges and costs (especially online) are replaced with a single, total, transparent cost for the product or service. I would put an end to the unnecessarily high fees charged by companies for customers paying by debit and credit card, and I would extend the same protections afforded those paying for goods by credit card to those using debit cards. I would like to see companies deal with customer complaints quicker, to prevent consumers waiting for weeks before they can approach an ombudsman, and I would clamp down harder on companies, such as mobile phone providers, that tweak their terms and conditions mid-contract. I would also speed up the appeals process so consumers are not left waiting for compensation while the ombudsman battles an industry over a decision, such as the recent payment protection insurance scandal when the banks appealed against a high court judgment forcing them to pay compensation. Some of the above points are included in the new EU consumer rights directive that has been adopted by 27 member states, but governments have until 2013 before they have to implement them and it remains to be seen what penalties the UK government will choose to levy on offenders. But let's not be downhearted. In my time fighting for your rights I have encountered heart-warming instances of companies bending over backwards to help readers, genuine expressions of remorse and a sincere willingness to tackle institutional problems within some organisations. I remain optimistic. As I step off the lofty perch we consumer champions occupy and take my place among the masses, I'll turn to the Bachelor &amp; Brignall column myself each week to see which companies need to hang their heads in shame. I know our readers will be in safe hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
