F\u00e1bregas was due to line up alongside Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 in the game on 22 December, with Cruyff quoted in Spain as being \"90% sure\" that the Arsenal midfielder would make the trip to Barcelona. Wenger has tried and failed to make contact with the former Holland international and Bar\u00e7a manager but has said his player will not be involved in the fixture. \"We don't allow the players to play in friendlies because we have too many games,\" said Wenger, who has seen his squad deprived of players such as Robin van Persie and Abou Diaby in recent weeks after picking up injuries while on more conventional international duty. \"In England we play football through the Christmas period while all the other countries stop and play friendlies and charity matches. There is a demand for Cesc but there is a demand for five or six other [Arsenal] players as well. \"There are four or five demands in Spain, for Africa, for little countries in Africa. I am not against it but I can't be sitting waiting here for the players to come back and then play Christmas games. That cannot work. We play on 27 December [against Aston Villa at the Emirates] and I didn't rest players against Olympiakos in midweek to let them play in a friendly. In life you always have to do well for the guy who pays you and the rest is less important. The best way for them to be charitable [in this case] is to sign a shirt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
