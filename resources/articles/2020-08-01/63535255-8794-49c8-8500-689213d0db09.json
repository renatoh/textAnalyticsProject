The British Medical Association (BMA) found a strong pattern of highly experienced women leaving GP partnerships, ending their positions as clinical leaders and directors and leaving medicine early, because they were struggling to cope with menopause symptoms with no support from management or peers. The findings will concern the nine out of 10 hospital bosses in England who fear understaffing across the service has become so severe that patients\u2019 health could be damaged: there are currently more than 30,000 female doctors aged 45-55, when menopause typically occurs. This number will rise significantly as the new cohort of medical students progress, almost 60% of whom are female. \u201cIt is extremely concerning to find that some women may be permanently stepping back from senior positions in medicine \u2013 a key cause of the gender pay gap \u2013 and the health service may be losing highly experienced staff because of inflexibility and a lack of support during a relatively short phase of life,\u201d said Dr Helena McKeown, BMA representative body chair. \u201cThe health service is under immense pressure and we cannot afford to lose experienced doctors because of a lack of flexibility and support,\u201d she added. More than 90% of the 2,000 respondents said that their menopause symptoms had affected their working lives but two-fifths (38%) said they were unable to make the changes they needed to their working pattern to cope with symptoms. Almost half said they had wanted to discuss their symptoms and seek support but did not feel comfortable doing so. A significant number said they would be \u201claughed at or ridiculed\u201d by both managers and peers if they spoke about the menopause. Only 16% of respondents had discussed their menopause symptoms with their manager. \u201cA clear theme throughout these kinds of responses is that the women still enjoyed their career but found they just couldn\u2019t manage their symptoms at work,\u201d the report found. \u201cAs one doctor said, \u2018I left a job I loved.\u2019\u201d Some respondents who were in male-dominated specialties believed that raising the topic and asking for changes or adjustments to help them manage their symptoms would be viewed negatively and add to the gender bias they already experienced. There was also concern that it would damage their career progression and they would be labelled as \u201cnot up to the job\u201d or that colleagues would think they were \u201cpast it\u201d and career opportunities would be taken away. \u201cThere are very few older women left at my senior level in my traditional profession. If I mentioned my perimenopausal symptoms, I would be stigmatised and disrespected as someone who was no longer rational or capable,\u201d said one respondent. Prof Neena Modi, president of the Medical Women\u2019s Federation, added: \u201cThe menopause affects more than half of the population, many to a debilitating extent. We hope this report will help employers provide appropriate support for their employees and end the taboos around a normal physiological process.\u201d A spokesperson for the NHS said: \u201cThe vast majority of women will experience menopausal symptoms at some point in their lives so it\u2019s important that people come forward to get the help they need, while it\u2019s right that employers do what they can to recognise the health impacts of menopause.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe health and wellbeing of all of our NHS and social care staff is our absolute priority. It is incredibly important that staff feel that they work in a safe and supportive environment where they are able to raise any issues which may affect their work with managers or colleagues. \u201cThe NHS People Plan, published last week, sets out the actions that will be taken to help the NHS become a modern and model employer and aims to improve physical and mental support for all staff.\u201d \u2018The menopause hit me like a rollercoaster\u2019 Dr Anne Carson, chair of BMA Northern Ireland\u2019s consultant committee and consultant radiologist at Craigavon area hospital, has been having menopausal symptoms for the last five years. \u201cI never expected to have crippling menopausal symptoms \u2013 I\u2019ve never not been able to deal with the demands of my life \u2013 but the menopause hit me like a rollercoaster. \u201cTalking about the menopause as a doctor is taboo. I held off for two years but I was suffering chronic sleep deprivation throughout that time because my night sweats were so bad. I could only sleep for a few hours at a time before having to get up to have a shower. I was getting to the point where my decision-making ability wasn\u2019t safe, so I had no choice: I had to tell my line manager. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do because the stigma is so great but my line manager was actually very understanding. \u201cBut even though he was sympathetic, the way the NHS works means that if I wanted to try to regulate my sleep a little better by doing fewer night shifts and on-calls, my only option was to cut my overall hours dramatically. But that also meant I cut my take-home pay dramatically. I\u2019m a single mother of two children at university and that reduction in my salary hit me hard. \u201cThe NHS just isn\u2019t flexible enough: if I\u2019d been allowed to just cut my on-call hours, then I could have continued to work full-time and they would have kept my expertise. Northern Ireland has the worst consultant shortage in the UK and I was disappointed in myself that I had to add to that shortage, but the inflexibility of the NHS structure gave me no choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
