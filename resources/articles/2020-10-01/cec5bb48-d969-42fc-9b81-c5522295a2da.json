The move followed growing calls to reverse the ban in the nation, with a senior police figure saying it benefits only Amazon and more than 30,000 people signing a petition calling for a U-turn on the restriction, which had led some shops to seal off shelves housing children\u2019s clothes and books with clingfilm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be reviewing how the weekend has gone with the supermarkets and making sure that common sense is applied,\u201d the first minister tweeted. \u201cSupermarkets can sell anything that can be sold in any other type of shop that isn\u2019t required to close. In the meantime, please only leave home if you need to.\u201d His announcement on Saturday evening came after he said the ban was a \u201cmatter of fairness\u201d as non-essential retailers have to close during the period, which began at 6pm on Friday. However, North Wales police and crime commissioner Arfon Jones said the move would only enrich online internet giants at the expense of high street retailers \u2013 concerns echoed by the Welsh Conservatives. \u201cPersonally I think the Welsh government decision to ban the sale of non-essential goods in shops that also sell essential goods is wrong and the only people that will benefit will be online sellers like Amazon,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBad move on this occasion by Mark Drakeford.\u201d Guidance published by the Welsh government says certain sections of supermarkets must be \u201ccordoned off or emptied, and closed to the public\u201d, and it defended the ban on Saturday. These include areas selling electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, garden products and dedicated sections for homewares. \u201cSupermarkets can keep selling items you can find in other essential shops \u2013 such as stationery/greeting cards,\u201d it tweeted. \u201cThe purpose of selling essential items only during firebreak is to discourage spending more time than necessary in shops and to be fair to retailers who have to close. This is not for the sake of being difficult \u2013 we need to do everything we can to minimise the time we spend outside our homes. This will help save lives and protect the NHS.\u201d A video posted on social media appeared to show a man ripping down plastic sheeting that was covering clothing aisles in a supermarket. \u201cWe do not agree that this is a prudent or rational measure, and will create more harm than good,\u201d the petition stated. \u201cWe do not agree for example that parents should be barred from buying clothes for their children during lockdown while out shopping. \u201cThis is disproportionate and cruel, and we ask that the decision be reversed immediately.\u201d On Saturday, Andrew Davies, the Welsh Conservatives\u2019 shadow health minister, called for the ban to be \u201cdropped immediately\u201d and has written to the presiding officer of the Welsh parliament calling for members to be recalled to discuss the ban. \u201cI have never witnessed such a fierce backlash against a decision from the Welsh Labour government,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ludicrous ban has caused real anger across Wales and it\u2019s not fair on those staff working in our supermarkets, and the general Welsh public who are already at their wit\u2019s end with a difficult fortnight looming. \u201cThe Wales-wide lockdown is disproportionate, unnecessary and biting our economy hard. I\u2019d rather see people being able to buy items in shops in their communities that provide employment to local people than see millions spent at online internet giants.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
