The former England coach signed a six-month contract when he succeeded Dave Jones at Molineux in December and agreed to a review of the situation at the end of the season. The brevity of the arrangement suggested the 47-year-old was keeping his long-term options open. Yesterday, however, he denied that he was holding out for a job with a more senior club or one closer to his Berkshire home, such as Fulham or West Ham. \"If that was the case I would not have brought the talks forward,\" he said. \"We always said discussions would take place at the end of the season. Had we qualified for the play-offs, talks about my future would have been a distraction. The talks are progressing and I'm hopeful they will be concluded within a few days of the season's end.\" Hoddle wants to establish how much money, if any, he will be given to spend on new players. Also on the agenda are the out-of-contract players Paul Ince, Colin Cameron and Michael Oakes. \u00b7 The consortium that controls Stoke City has put the club up for sale because of the reluctance of Tony Pulis to select Icelandic players for his first team. Stoke Holding, an Iceland-based consortium, has held a 60% interest in the club since November 1999. \"Part of the original idea was to improve the opportunities of Icelandic footballers to play professionally in England,\" said Gunnar Gislason, Stoke's chairman. \"All team managers in the last five years have been aware of this.\" Pulis, who took over in 2003, has not complied, however. He responded to the signing of Toddi Gudjonsson in January by giving the player two substitute appearances. Tryggvi Gudmundsson, another January signing, has already returned to Iceland. Pulis has made it clear he will select players on merit, and that stance did not prevent him from being given a one-year rolling contract recently. But it has prompted Magnus Kristinsson, the chairman of Stoke Holding, to put its stake in the Potters up for sale. The decision to sell is likely to interest a fellow director, Peter Rawlins, who owns a 10% stake and made two abortive bids for the club 3 years ago. \u00b7 Chester have appointed Keith Curle as manager in place of Ian Rush, who resigned this month. Curle was dismissed by Mansfield in November for allegedly bullying one of the trainees and has a one-year deal. \u00b7 Juventus do not have to hand back the titles they won in the mid-90s even though the club's doctor had been found guilty of doping offences, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has ruled in Lausanne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
