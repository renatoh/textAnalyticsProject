The popular notion that the elite core of Russell Group universities unilaterally favour doubling or even trebling tuition fees while the modern universities oppose it is far off the mark (as shown below). Vice-chancellors are actively considering alternative funding streams ranging from online distance learning degrees to employer contributions, industrial sponsorship and alumni endowments. If the UK is moving towards a US style of higher education, the good news is that over there the public-funded state universities are making greatest progress in securing new income streams. The UK's diverse HE sector is likely to see polarisation between a top tier of world-class universities and a range of institutions including merged FE/HE colleges offering students a wide range of degree and short CPD (continuous professional development) courses as part of lifelong learning. Rodney Eastwood Director of strategy and planning, Imperial College Funding higher education over the next decade is about finding a balance between how much the student, the student's family and the taxpayer should contribute. That is a blend of the graduate's future earnings, upfront fees and a state contribution. The balance might not necessarily be the same for each subject or each institution. At Imperial we're neutral about the expansion of higher education, but if expansion means resources per student would go down, we would resist that. Science and engineering are not cheap degrees to teach. Providing a first-class education is expensive as academic salaries are, quite rightly, catching up with other professions and rising faster than inflation. We would favour lifting the cap on student fees. Higher education is a market and this has to find its own level. My own philosophy is that government should not interfere unless it has to. Universities are being asked to compensate for deficiencies in schools, society, economic regeneration, employability and social inclusion. Although Imperial will play its part in all of these, alongside world-class research its most important contribution is to provide a first-class education that will stand the student and their employer in good stead. A third of our students are from overseas and in the last five years numbers of Chinese students have grown tenfold. I don't see this diminishing. But the government needs to encourage home students. It's a very difficult decision, politically. The government must decide where to invest. If it is thinking purely commercially, it needs to put money into the skills the country needs to operate effectively in the 21st-century knowledge economy. Or it could decide to invest in cultural or social inclusion. It is equally valid to support undergraduate choice. After all, the great strength of the UK academic sector lies in the autonomy of its universities. If more of the state funding for higher education were in the hands of the students, those achieving the highest A-level grades could be supported financially with a higher bursary. This is an incentive for young people to do well at school and also enables them to apply to the more popular universities that could charge a higher fee for their higher costs. Account could be taken of the fact that students from state school are not getting as high grades as those from private schools. Mike Thorne Vice-chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University It's all a question of demographics. By 2017 there will be 500,000 fewer UK school-leavers, and universities will have to develop more part-time degrees aimed at re-educating today's workforce. It is an inescapable fact that, if the sector is to grow or maintain numbers, we need to develop new offerings like Anglia Ruskin's online degree programme, Ultraversity, for upskilling adults in the workplace. This conference did not address the biggest issue, which is the expansion of the overseas market. You really have to look at Australia and the US to see the exciting stuff that could and should be happening in our HE sector. Overseas universities are coming on to our territory and moving into our market. Monash University, for example, has a huge operation in the UK and major US private education providers have formed partnerships with universities like Brunel and Hertfordshire to market HE to overseas students. We have seen Phoenix University expand to 250,000 distance learning students. The British Council report Vision 2020 says the UK ought to be educating 200,000 more students but yet we have done nothing about it as a country. The report correctly identified the UK university sector vying neck and neck with the US in areas like China and India and emerging markets such as Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Brazil. If you accept that in 10 years' time UK universities could be teaching another 200,000 students, that would demand the creation of 20,000 new academic jobs. And yet no government is talking about investing in HE on anything like this scale. If I was an overseas inward investor looking to set up a factory in the UK in a regeneration area, I would be given a grant of \u00a37,000 for each job I created. I could get \u00a370m in government aid. Developing capacity to market UK universities overseas is a similar case. The government needs to invest now to put UK universities on a level playing field with the rest of the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
