Thursday\u2019s quake landed in the small city of Ridgecrest, 100 miles (160km) from Los Angeles, and renewed fears about the potential for the \u201cbig one\u201d to hit the west coast in the future. Lucy Jones, one of the world\u2019s foremost seismologists, spoke to the Guardian on Friday morning about the science behind the quakes, why the region should expect more earthquakes in the coming years, and whether LA is really prepared for disaster. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. What has the history of earthquakes in southern California taught us, and why has it been so quiet for the past 20 years? By studying the faults and how much they move we know approximately how many earthquakes we\u2019ll have to have on them over 100,000 years to match with what the geology tells us. But, getting down into the human timescale, you get random subsets. For southern California, it works out to something close to a magnitude 8 every 100 or 200 years, a magnitude 7 about every 20 to 30 years, and a magnitude 6 every three years. The bigger earthquakes are much less frequent than the smaller ones. This is the first magnitude 6 quake in 20 years. It\u2019s the longest interval we\u2019ve ever had. We also saw the rates of 5s and 4s and 3s go down. Is that just random fluctuation? Potentially. We had 20 years that was a particularly quiet time, and what we don\u2019t know is, was that an actual change in rate and now we\u2019re going to go back to a higher rate or was that just random clustering? Either way, we know that the last 20 years was abnormal and that\u2019s not our long-term rate, and we should expect more earthquakes than we\u2019ve been having recently. Chances are, we\u2019re going to have more earthquakes in the next five years than we\u2019ve had in the last five years. If this kind of quake had hit LA yesterday, it could\u2019ve been devastating. Do you feel that LA is prepared? Better than we used to be, and not as good as we should be. I spent 2014 at Los Angeles city hall.The seismic plan that was passed is the most comprehensive improvement in seismic safety we\u2019ve seen. One piece is to retrofit a particularly bad type of building \u2013 called the \u201csoft first story\u201d, which is the same type of building that killed people in the Northridge Meadows apartment building in 1994. In the city of Los Angeles, 13,500 such buildings were identified. Over half of them are already well into the retrofit process, or have completed it . That\u2019s a big change of people who aren\u2019t going to die in an earthquake. There are also some big programs involving the water system, that include significant improvements. Losing water after the earthquake is one of the biggest economic hits. What are the most common misconceptions about earthquakes in the region? Earthquakes really are random. People are desperate for a pattern, but you really don\u2019t get to make one of it. For people who view the quake as a wake-up call and want to be more prepared, what are a few simple things they could do right now? There\u2019s a great \u201cseven steps to earthquake safety\u201d at earthquakecountry.org. Make sure you have water, a family plan, and that you\u2019ve secured the things in your house. If you look around the world at what has happened to communities that go through bad disasters, the communities that recover are the ones where people are connected to each other. Social scientists call it a high degree of social capital, and if you think of Los Angeles, you don\u2019t think of people really connected to their neighbors. I think that is our biggest weakness. One of the things we\u2019re working on is trying to develop a program to help community organizations \u2013 churches, schools, places where people connect to each other \u2013 to be better prepared for earthquakes and ready to help their members and their communities \u2026 Increase the social capital as a way of being ready for the earthquake. I think that\u2019s the part where LA is really going to suffer. When we think about future weather disasters in California, where do earthquakes fall on the spectrum, relative to climate change and other threats? Globally, there\u2019s no point in worrying about the earthquake problem if we aren\u2019t dealing with climate change. We\u2019re afraid of earthquakes. They really trigger every button in us, that randomness \u2026 but the biggest disaster in California history wasn\u2019t an earthquake, it was a flood. There was so much rain in the winter of 1861-62that it bankrupted the state, destroyed one-third of the taxable land, and killed about 1% of the population. And most Californians don\u2019t even know that it happened. Those types of really big atmospheric river storms (ARkStorm) are going to get worse. We will probably increase the number of hurricanes that make it out to LA. We\u2019re going to have more flooding problems. As a seismologist , what was your reaction yesterday when you started feeling the quake? I was sitting at home ready to go pick up my 99-year-old aunt for a family gathering for Fourth of July. One of the first things I did was call my aunt and say it ain\u2019t going to happen today.Both of my adult sons called me and said, \u2018So, what do you think?\u2019 I said if you can come and cook, we\u2019re good. It actually took me a few seconds to be sure it was an earthquake, since the level of shaking was low. Once I was sure, I started counting and, for about 10 seconds, I felt noticeable stronger levels of shaking. So I knew it had to be over magnitude 6. Then I got up and got to work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
