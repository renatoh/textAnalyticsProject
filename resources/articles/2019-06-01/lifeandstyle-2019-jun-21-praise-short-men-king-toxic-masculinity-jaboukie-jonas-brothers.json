It wasn\u2019t a jokey name \u2013 a put-down poking fun at the little guy \u2013 but an honorific: \u201cShort kings are the enemy of body negativity,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, \u201cand I\u2019ll be forever proud to defend them.\u201d In 2019, taking ownership of one\u2019s identity is the ideal mode of being \u2013 and those who carry their genuine, multi-dimensional selves with pride deserve respect. That includes short dudes, a segment of society who, while not exactly persecuted, are certainly prone to being overlooked. Young-White\u2019s paeans to short kings encourage us to confront society\u2019s overvaluation of men\u2019s height, and recognize the guys under 6ft whose positive attitudes render them nothing short of regal. A short king isn\u2019t just any male-presenting person of modest stature \u2013 it\u2019s someone who has the strength of character to flourish in the face of conventional male beauty standards. As such, 5ft 7in, Spiderman actor Tom Holland is a short king, as are Pulitzer-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar (5ft 5in) trans actor Ian Alexander (5ft) and (short) \u201cking in the north\u201d Kit Harington (5ft 7in), who admits he allowed taller actors on the set of Game of Thrones to ruffle his hair. Yet celebrity is by no means a requirement to be a short king. Any short man can be a short king (including my own 5ft 7in boyfriend, my match in height and ginger hair). Young-White (himself 5ft 9in) includes all men under 6ft in his movement, though many have pointed out the average American man is 5ft 10in, making that the more accurate cutoff. Young-White decreed last 21 June as the first \u2018short king appreciation day\u2019, kicking off what has become a year of public declarations of short king love. As to whether or not short men really require kudos just for being secure \u2026 well, it depends on your perspective. Even as society begins to see the danger of shaming individuals for, say, acne or being overweight, diminishing short people is still something Meryl Streep can do on premium cable. (\u201cI find little people untrustworthy,\u201d announces Streep\u2019s character on the new season of Big Little Lies). Micheal Foulk, 33, a 5ft 7in non-binary comedian from Oakland, has noticed a double standard: \u201cIt\u2019ll be like, OK, we\u2019re going to agree that we\u2019re not going to be cruel to people that are heavier set or larger-bodied. But if people are short, it\u2019s like: go off, sis!\u201d Sizeism is hard to avoid on dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder, where users commonly forbid men under 6ft from contacting them. Tinder even made a 2019 April Fool\u2019s joke about launching a \u201cheight verification\u201d update that would prevent guys from exaggerating their stature. Yet short-shaming isn\u2019t harmless. \u201cThere\u2019s a host of studies that show short men are stigmatized in many ways, not only in people\u2019s perception, but in actual real world outcomes as well,\u201d says Joseph Vandello, a social psychologist at the University of Southern Florida. \u201cPeople perceive shorter men as having fewer leadership qualities,\u201d he says, citing findings that majority of American CEOs are over 6ft in and voters prefer tall presidential candidates (including, at 6ft 2in, Trump). All this starts early \u2013 even in kindergarten, studies have found, teachers perceive the shortest boys in their class as less academically capable than their peers. Height is also perceived to correlate directly with masculinity. As Vandello explains: \u201cBecause of [the correlation between height and perceived masculinity], a lot of men feel kind of a chronic sense of anxiety and uncertainty about their manhood status.\u201d Insecurity generally manifests in oversensitivity to insult (which may contribute to the stereotype of short men as angry, resentful, over-compensating Napoleons.) Unfortunately, this hasn\u2019t just been the year of the short king. It\u2019s also been a year of increased media coverage and public awareness of incels \u2013 online communities of \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men whose self-loathing manifests in derogatory, in some cases extremely violent, behavior towards women, and a pathological obsession with altering their appearance to fit a narrow definition of brawny masculine beauty. The dismaying presence of incels prompts a complicated question: how do we talk about bolstering men\u2019s self-esteem at a time when society is interrogating the injustices of male privilege, and the connection between masculine insecurity and violence? The answer may lay in a reconceptualization of manhood. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting time,\u201d says Brendan Steven, a 27-year-old, 5ft 5in writer from Ontario. \u201cMany of us sense that our ideas of the masculine and feminine that we grew up with are too constraining. But at the same time, there are such things as masculine and feminine traits and we value them to some extent.\u201d Like many short men, Steven recalls an adolescence spent believing masculinity was defined by a set of immutable characteristics \u2013 like being tall and imposing \u2013 and that by not fitting that ideal he was \u201ckind of cursed.\u201d But as he grew up, he began thinking about manhood as something he could develop by embodying his values, rather than a blunt appraisal of his physical self. \u201cI think to be masculine, to be manly, whatever that word means, is about doing good in the world. It\u2019s about contributing. It\u2019s about finding a way to serve other people, to be kind, to be strong in defense of those who need strength in their corner. The more masculinity is an idea of service the more I think it is helpful. Now happily committed to a taller woman, Brendan hardly thinks about his height at all. \u201cOnce you get into that sense of self-confidence the height issue kind of melts away,\u201d he says. For Foulk, the comedian, seeing the term \u201cshort king\u201d emerge on Twitter was empowering. \u201cI think that sometimes it comes across as kind of silly, but it\u2019s so important. It was a really big deal to me, especially when it came to weight and height, to be like, \u2018I\u2019m very into what I have going on.\u2019 Despite many people telling me not to be.\u201d Now Foulk considers short kingship a badge of pride. \u201cLike, yes. I\u2019m a short king and that is not a negative word.\u201d Different interpretations of what it means to be a man are the wings on which the short king soars. The short king embodies the dismantling of the height hierarchy and conventional expectations, his masculinity firmly grounded and personally defined. In the words of Young-White, the short king is valid, hot, enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
