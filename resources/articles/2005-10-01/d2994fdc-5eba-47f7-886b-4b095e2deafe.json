The would-be leader published a manifesto yesterday entitled I'm Coming, It's Later Than You Think, criticising the government and the opposition and calling for more \"participatory democracy\". The presidential hopeful gave a question-and-answer interview to Le Parisien newspaper. But, bizarrely, Monsieur X, as the candidate has been nicknamed by the French media, has refused to be identified. According to Le Parisien, the French intelligence services discovered two weeks ago that an anonymous candidate was planning to stand as president. The author of the manifesto goes by the name of Catherine M\u00e9dicis, and the secret operation to launch the election campaign was codenamed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. A baroque marketing ploy, asks Le Parisien newspaper, or a bad joke? Yves Michalon, the publisher of the 10,000 copies of the manifesto, J'arrive, has a string of high-level political contacts and counts himself a friend of the president, Jacques Chirac, as well as of Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister, and Alain Jupp\u00e9, the former rightwing king-maker. Mr Michalon said he was putting his reputation on the line. \"I simply dread that the idea will be corrupted by those who, locked in their own views, have little interest in hearing and taking into account the ideas, criticisms and suggestions of the citizens,\" he said. In the Parisien interview the mysterious candidate dismisses the idea that it is a publicity stunt. \"A presidential candidate doesn't launch himself like a soap powder.\" The decision to remain anonymous was defended: \"My friends and I have no desire to die [politically] before we've even begun.\" French media refer to 1964 when another presidential hopeful, Gaston Deferre, published his candidature under the name of Monsieur X. At least a dozen personalities, encompassing communist, socialist worker, green, royalist, and ecologist parties, are considering putting themselves forward for the 2007 election. Yesterday, people were wondering about the most recent and why the person had chosen the name Catherine M\u00e9dicis, recalling the mother of a sickly Middle Ages king. Monsieur X has a website: www.5janvier2007.net - the date when apparently all will be revealed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
