Many of the firms that provide most of the UK\u2019s 465,000 care home beds are owned or backed by hedge funds, while some of the biggest are based in overseas tax havens. The Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI) estimated that \u00a31.5bn a year \u2013 10% of the care home industry\u2019s \u00a315bn income \u2013 \u201cleaks\u201d and often ends up enriching owners or other firms closely linked to them. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find out where the \u00a315bn ends up,\u201d it said. \u201cSome of the largest care home businesses are extracting a lot of profit disguised as rent and loan repayment costs,\u201d said Vivek Kotecha, the CHPI\u2019s research manager, who undertook the analysis of financial arrangements for independent care home providers. \u201cThis makes it hard for local authorities and individuals to know how much extra funding the industry actually needs and how financially sustainable it really is.\u201d The \u00a31.5bn is taken out in the form of rent, profit, directors\u2019 fees and debt repayments, rather than being spent on the care of residents, the CHPI found. That is the same sum of money that the government promised at the last spending review to put into social care, given acute concern over the deep cuts to the sector since austerity began in 2010. Around half of the \u00a315bn comes from local councils paying residents\u2019 fees and the other half from older people funding their own stays. Prof Bob Hudson, of Kent University\u2019s centre for health service studies, said the findings showed \u201csome large care providers are taking public money away from direct care into unwarranted profiteering\u201d. For small and medium-sized operators, \u00a37 out of every \u00a3100 they receive in fees goes into profit before tax, rent payments, directors\u2019 remuneration and net interest payments, the CHPI found. However, for the 18 largest profit-driven firms, it is \u00a315 per \u00a3100. The report claimed that firms use an array of financial mechanisms to boost their profit margins. Debt repayments can be \u201ca source of hidden profits and tax avoidance\u201d, it added. For example, the 26 largest providers put \u00a3261m of fee income into paying off debts, of which \u00a3117m goes to companies related to them \u2013 which the CHPI described as \u201ca known way of avoiding tax and hiding profits\u201d. One-sixth (16%) of the money received from councils or individuals by firms that are owned or backed by private equity outfits goes into debt repayment. That is linked to the fact that such operators have borrowed \u00a335,000 for each bed they own, CHPI said. Similarly, while some of the largest companies spend between 15% and 32% of their income on rent, the eight largest not-for-profit providers\u2019 outlay in this area is just 2% of their fees. Private firms own 94% of the UK\u2019s total stock of 464,900 beds, according to data collated by care market specialists Laing and Buisson. Of those, 376,000 (81%) belong to profit-driven firms, with 61,100 (13%) owned by not-for-profit operators. The other 27,700 (6%) are owned by councils or the NHS. \u201cEvery year millions of pounds are lost from the sector that could have been spent on care. There are rich pickings for the shadowy businesses operating UK care homes from tropical tax havens, siphoning off their haul while residents go short,\u201d said Christina McAnea, assistant general secretary of the union Unison, which partly funded the research. The government is under pressure to fix what charities and campaigners said is a broken social care system and put significantly more public money into it. Boris Johnson pledged in July to bring forward a solution, but has not yet unveiled any proposals. But the CHPI warned that a major injection of public funds into the sector could simply produce larger profits for operators, given how opaque the finances of many firms are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
