The diminished dividend pot of just \u00a352bn is bad news for Britain's pension funds, which rely on the yield from their shareholdings to meet their commitments. In fact during the first six months of the year, companies were more interested in raising capital than rewarding shareholders, collecting a record \u00a351bn to bolster battered balance sheets \u2013 more than in the five years from 2003 to 2007. Research by Capita Registrars showed 70 fewer companies paid a dividend than in the first half of the year, as firms from British Airways to Anglo American and Currys owner DSG International grappled with the downturn. Oil stocks such as Shell and BP proved the most resilient, thanks to last year's high oil prices. \"The figures paint a clear picture of how the recession is hitting some parts of the economy and not others,\" said Paul Taylor, head of corporate advisory at Capita Registrars. \"The banking sector has distorted the picture, with very high dividends on boom-inflated profits collapsing to the current lows. Without the huge windfalls in the energy sector, the overall picture would have been far worse.\" The data shows British companies paid dividends of \u00a328.3bn in the first six months of 2009, 9% lower than in the same period of 2008. Capita estimates firms will pay out \u00a352bn in the full year, a decline of 13% on 2008. Household goods and general retailers paid out 90% less than a year ago, while banks, despite their well-publicised woes, cut their dividends only 29% \u2013 although state-backed RBS and Lloyds Banking Group have suspended payments. The banks had almost without exception maintained dividend payments during the last recession but this time around it has been energy, drugs, food and drinks stocks, as well as supermarkets, that have provided relief for investors. Energy companies distributed \u00a32.4bn more during the period, and have doubled their share of all dividends paid since 2007. The banks have produced a dividend pool of just \u00a34bn so far this year compared with \u00a39bn in the equivalent period of 2007 when the sector was still booming. They were responsible for the bulk of the equity raisings, hoovering up \u00a327bn \u2013 much of it from the taxpayer \u2013 in the first half of 2009, giving a total of \u00a350bn for the last 12 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
