It's the latest movie in a tradition of romantic ghost stories that stretches from The Ghost Goes West and the Topper comedies of the Thirties through The Ghost and Mrs Muir in the Forties to the big 1990 hit, Ghost, of which this is a distaff version. The appealingly dishevelled Mark Ruffalo plays a traumatised widower of great sensitivity who rents a marvellous apartment in San Francisco belonging to workaholic doctor Reese Witherspoon. In the first 10 minutes, we've seen her involved in a horrendous crash on her way home from a 27-hour stint at the hospital. She's now in a coma three months after the accident, and her spirit turns up to haunt the flat and fall in love with Ruffalo. The movie is cute rather than witty. The rules of haunting are established, only to be broken whenever it suits the plot to do so. And the picture ends up endorsing the most right-wing views on the pulling of plugs that artificially sustain the lives of people in a permanent vegetative state."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
