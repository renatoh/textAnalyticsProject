Each home was given a \u00a3250 voucher by B&amp;Q and a visit from one of the brand's energy assessors. Then it was over to them to slash their energy bills and future-proof their homes in just a few weeks. \"We wanted a competition that would demystify the stuff around energy efficiency,\" says Sarah Greenaway of B&amp;Q, \"but also find someone who was great at communicating the most effective tips and ideas.\" On social media the finalists went into overdrive, swapping tips from putting pillows in the freezer to make it work more efficiently to activating energy saving buttons on games consoles. Every step was photographed and catalogued with wit and verve. In the end, the winners were Tom Yearley and Delphine Wakes from Reading who get \u00a310,000 to spend at B&amp;Q on renewable energy measures. Runners-up: Robin Cathcart, Jen Gale, Hannah Goddard, Kate Harrison, Peter Hawkins, Steve Huckle, David Kemp James Murnaghan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
