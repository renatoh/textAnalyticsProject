Texas's legendary Waggoner ranch bought by Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke", "bodyText": "Stan Kroenke, billionaire and owner of the Los Angeles Rams and the Premier League\u2019s Arsenal, has agreed to purchase the legendary WT Waggoner ranch in Texas, representatives for the property announced on Tuesday. The ranch spans about 800 square miles across six counties in north Texas, making it about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. Thought to be the largest ranch behind one fence, the Waggoner was listed at $725m, the highest-priced estate in the world. Kroenke is also a rancher, with property in Montana, Arizona, Wyoming, British Columbia \u2013 and now, Texas. \u201cThis is an incredible opportunity and an even greater responsibility,\u201d Kroenke said in a statement. \u201cWe are honored to assume ownership of the Waggoner \u2013 a true Texas and American landmark.\u201d Kroenke bought the ranch in a private transaction with the family owners of the Waggoner. This is the first time the ranch, established in 1849, has ever been sold. Representatives for the sale declined to disclose the terms for the purchase. The purchase angered several Arsenal fans, who complained on Twitter that Kroenke, the majority shareholder for the team, failed to strengthen the team in the January transfer window, ahead of their push for the Premier League title. Located about a three-hour drive north-west of Dallas, the Waggoner ranch was founded in 1849 and has remained in the family ever since. Bernard Uechtritz, one of the property brokers, told the Guardian in October that about a dozen contenders emerged out of 700 initial requests from potential buyers of the ranch. The ranch was put up for sale in 2014 following decades of disputes among the family over how to liquidate the property. The ranch currently employs 120 people, and several employees are multigenerational, with parents and grandparents having worked on the ranch before them. When the Waggoner was put up for sale, ranch staff worried about the new owner\u2019s intentions, fearing he or she could divide up the land and fire employees. \u201cThe sale of the Waggoner was an extraordinarily complex and multifaceted process, and its successful culmination is a tribute to the many people, teams and layers of teams representing all sides behind the process,\u201d Uechtritz said in a statement. Currently, 56,000 acres of the estate have been developed for oil, leaving more than 450,000 acres untapped. The two sides of the Waggoner family who have been fighting over the estate will each retain 12.5% of the mineral rights in any sale. Kroenke was ninth on the Land Report\u2019s 2015 list of largest landowners in the US. In 2012 he bought a 124,000-acre ranch in Montana called the Broken O Ranch. He owns cattle operations in Montana and Q Creek, the largest contiguous ranch in the Rocky Mountains. Philip Anschutz, a tycoon whose Anschutz Entertainment Group owns Major League Soccer\u2019s Los Angeles Galaxy, was 18th in the rankings. Bobby Patton, a co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, bought the more than 173,000-acre York Ranch in New Mexico in 2014. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant correlation between large landowners and sports franchises. Both John Malone and Ted Turner, America\u2019s largest and second-largest landowners, have owned the Atlanta Braves. The nation\u2019s fourth-largest owner, Brad Kelley, has established his Thoroughbred stable as one of horse racing\u2019s leading contenders,\u201d said Eric O\u2019Keefe, editor of the Land Report. \u201cWhen it comes to leading landowners with sports teams, no one can compete with Kroenke, [whose companies control] Arsenal, the NFL\u2019s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL\u2019s Colorado Avalanche, the NBA\u2019s Denver Nuggets, and MLS\u2019s Colorado Rapids.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
