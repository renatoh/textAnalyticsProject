(December 6, tinyurl.com/2ugpt7)? There's nothing gender- specific in the article itself, and the security concerns are relevant to both genders. It's not an article aimed particularly at women (apart from being written by one). That's before issues about gender stereotyping and sexism - women only use pink technology, right? On a more positive note, the article itself was great. It's just a shame you chose to present it like that. Sarah Dobbs, London \u00b7 It made me realise that we have a big problem here, with everyone using their cat's name or their birthday. I've taken the hint and emailed everyone to use IlrtGTs04 for a password in future. No-one's broken into our system yet - as far as I know. Jake Gartside, Hythe Operating at speed For those of you unlucky enough to have been stuck with Vista on a recently purchased computer (or foolish enough to have paid good money to \"upgrade\" your XP machine) it will no doubt come as a relief to know that your expensive operating system won't suddenly cease to function for no reason whatsoever (Microsoft to ease draconian activation procedure, December 6). Yes, you should have many years of excruciatingly slow, memory-hogging operation ahead. You could, of course, downgrade your computer to XP. The process of doing so sounds like a royal pain in the ass, but you'll be rewarded with a faster and more stable operating system. semiconscious.org Farewell, email Not sure about the demise of email, but my inbox is a battlefield (Digital generation dismisses email as 'for old people', December 6) - and I am constantly losing. mbf.blogs.com \u00b7 Everyone who is in school now thinks email is for old people. And I reluctantly admit I am one of the \"old people\". They're texting, Facebooking, etc etc, but email? Might as well give them a fountain pen and a bottle of ink. prstudies.typepad.com/weblog Writing on the Wiki wall Whether Wikipedia can achieve a stable and sustainable model remains to be seen (Seth Finkelstein, December 6). The jury is out, but there is some ominous writing on the wall. aggieblue.blogspot.com OLPC too expensive I read Kate Bevan's piece about the One Laptop Per Child project with interest (Newly Asked Questions, November 29) and felt that I should bring Computer Aid International to your attention. The charity has provided more than 10,000 PCs to schools and universities in developing countries, proving that there is a viable alternative to OLPC. Louise Richards, CEO, agrees that the scheme is too expensive to make any real impact on the countries it aims to help. Kate Solomon, Computeraid Bad luck, Windows users Peter Berrie (Letters, December 6) makes a good point about the lack of basic IT competencies within HMRC, but in mentioning Perl and awk, he hints at a deeper problem. These utilities are part of the standard toolkit of IT professionals who work with Unix or Linux systems, but their counterparts in organisations dominated by Windows are not so fortunate. Windows does not have the data-processing tools offered by Unix, so the powerful shell-scripting techniques he describes are impossible if you're tied to Windows. Perhaps HMRC might have avoided the Child Support database disaster if its IT staff had been able to use a more suitable OS.
