In May, 20-year-old Norwegian wunderkind Sondre Lerche performed at a royal variety show to mark the wedding of Crown Princess Martha-Louise of Norway to cult author Ari Behn. In the audience were assorted European aristocracy, random royals - we sent Edward and Sophie - and crusty officialdom, all ready and waiting for Lerche and his band. 'We looked better than The Strokes. I was looking straight into the eyes of the Norwegian Queen - and she was getting down,' says the slight singer and songwriter six months later, in a modernist bar in his mountain-bound home town of Bergen (population 25,000). 'It was a good gig! Here, everyone gets so drunk at gigs. At least this lot were sitting still and listening.' Strange then, that an artist rubber-stamped by royalty should be preparing to zoom into the British consciousness, where pleasing the establishment is tantamount to mutiny against the Rules of Pop. 'They needed a pop angle,' he suggests, slurping on a chocolate milkshake, 'and probably, we're a bit more sporting here.' More importantly, Lerche has an incendiary talent on his side. His debut album Faces Down is dizzyingly accomplished, melding Brazilian pop, psychedelic 60s West Coast dream-tunes and lush, deceptively complex arrangements into an emotive dive into fjords, single bedrooms and school desks. Then there's his voice: an oak-aged waterfall of warmth pricked with hints of Bowie, which sounds as if it should emanate from someone bigger and older than this slender, sleepy-intense Nordic pixie-man who was born in 1982. 'If someone hears it in the supermarket and thinks \"that's catchy\" I'm happy,' he shrugs. 'But I like to add jazz thinking, a new dimension. We don't need any more music that takes the old pop routines straight to the garbage can.' Released in Scandinavia last year, Faces Down has been certified gold. He's had a hit with the nagging, heartbeat rhythms of 'Sleep on Needles', and won a 2001 Spelemannsprisen - the Norwegian Grammy - for Best New Artist. Lerche is now quantifiably famous, appearing in the daily newspapers for weeks on end and having to ditch the paparazzi. At home in Bergen, away from the industry centre in Oslo, he can do pretty much as he pleases - which this week involved spending the day in his new, high-ceilinged flat, obsessively re-winding Surf's Up and Sunflower by The Beach Boys. At the age of four, Lerche was obsessed by 80s Norwegian pop heart-throbs A-ha. 'There is no end to the admiration I had for them in my childhood,' he says. His parents bought him a guitar when he was eight. Lessons didn't last long. 'The classical guitar wasn't for me,' he says, arms folded in front of today's shirt, a 70s-cut oddity with a blue and purple bee-print. 'I picked up a few basic things and then went off on my own to learn it myself.' Discovered by local producer HP Gundersen, he put out two EPs. 'I wrote as if someone was accusing me of not being good, but I knew it was good because I'd worked properly at every inch of it. Nowadays I realise you can leave some space for air.' The records were released while he was still at high school in Bergen. 'It was a very bizarre situation, very strange,' he says. 'I had my final exams and I was in the centre of this huge response to songs I'd written in my room, and recorded with my friends in a small studio.' The Industrihuset, an ugly little tower behind a church in Bergen, is the 'small studio' in question. It's an enclave of talent and a centrifugal point for new Bergen music, housing not only Lerche, but fellow award-nominees R\u00f8yksopp, the Air-esque band who, with Melody AM, created 2001's ubiquitous chill-out LP; Kings of Convenience (FM hit: 'Toxic Girl'); and electronic label Tell\u00e9. 'Bergen is a great place to be,' he agrees. 'It's an environment where there are a lot of people making different music, but sharing a kind of intention and attitude. A lot of people have an idealistic approach to music - they're making something they like.' The last wave of Bergen bands appeared in the early 90s, with names like Pogo Pops and Chocolate Overdose. Unlike the former, Bergen's second new wave - ridden with ease by Sondre Lerche - could be a big one. \u00b7 The single 'Sleep on Needles' is released on 21 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
