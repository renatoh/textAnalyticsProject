A 77-year-old retired teacher who was subjected to a vicious rape attempt by the \"lottery rapist\" Iorworth Hoare 18 years ago will ask three judges to overturn a high court ruling barring her damages claim against him. The claim by the woman, Mrs A, is one of three test cases to highlight the strict six-year time limit for launching compensation claims for deliberate assaults. The Law Commission, the official law reform body, recommended five years ago that the law should be reformed to prevent further injustices. The government has accepted the case for change but has failed to legislate. Meanwhile, thousands of victims of child abuse, rape and sexual assault have been told that they brought their cases too late. Hoare attacked Mrs A in broad daylight in a park in Leeds in February 1988. Sentencing him to life imprisonment in 1989, Mr Justice Rougier told him: \"For every moment you are at liberty some woman is at risk.\" Now 53, Hoare has spent most of his life behind bars for rape, attempted rape and indecent assault. Alan Newman QC, Mrs A's lawyer, told the high court, which threw out her case last October, that there was something \"very wrong in the law\" if his client was not able to claim compensation for Hoare's attack. \"In the most vicious and disgusting manner he proceeded to sexually assault the claimant. It was a most degrading incident and [included] fairly unspeakable acts on the part of Mr Hoare,\" he said of her ordeal. Mrs A did not sue earlier because Hoare had no money or property. But in August 2004 while on weekend leave from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire, he won \u00a37m after buying a lottery ticket. He was freed on parole last March. Mrs A received less than \u00a35,000 compensation from the criminal injuries compensation scheme and says her main aim in suing Hoare is \"to repay the public purse\". The appeal court judges, headed by the master of the rolls, Sir Anthony Clarke, will consider Mrs A's case and two others involving alleged sex abuse by teachers. The time limit causes the biggest problems in child abuse cases, where it may be many years before victims appreciate the devastating effects the abuse has had on their lives. This six-year time limit for claiming compensation for a deliberate assault starts to run when the act happens - or at 18, if the victim is a child. It contrasts with a three-year limit for suing over negligent acts, such as road accidents, which starts to run when the victim knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim. Judges have a discretion to extend the three-year limit, but not the six-year one. When parliament set the six-year limit in 1954, the effects of child abuse were little known, and it did not occur to legislators that someone could be harmed by a deliberate act but be unaware of the injury done to them. Among those who have benefited from the current law is the millionaire former businessman William Goad, dubbed \"Britain's worst paedophile\", who is serving a life sentence for child abuse. Few of his many victims over 40 years of abuse, some as young as eight at the time, are likely to see any compensation from the fortune he amassed through a chain of discount stores and indoor markets. The association of child abuse lawyers, which is campaigning for a change in the law, argues that it denies victims the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by article 6 of the European convention on human rights. Current law Claims for negligence have to be brought within three years of the date when the victim knew of the injury, though a judge can extend this time. Claims for a deliberate assault have to be brought within six years of the assault. This limit is strict and non-extendable. If the victim is a child, the time starts running from age 18, which means that no victims over 24 can sue their attackers for compensation. Lawyers acting for abuse victims say the law encourages perpetrators to intimidate victims into keeping quiet. In 2001 the Law Commission recommended a three-year limit, running from the date the claimant knew or should reasonably have known the facts about the injury, for most types of legal claim, with a discretion for the judge to extend it. But the recommendation remains unimplemented."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
