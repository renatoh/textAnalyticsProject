The four members of Swedish pop phenomenon Abba were reunited in Stockholm on Wednesday \u2013 but, sadly for fans, only for the opening of a new entertainment venture: Mamma Mia! The Party. Questioned by reporters, Benny Andersson insisted that he didn\u2019t think the four of them would be getting back together on stage. \u201cWe are here to party,\u201d added his fellow composer Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. The band, fronted by the pair\u2019s then wives Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, once reportedly turned down $1bn to re-form, though in a Guardian interview in 2014 they did not rule out recording together again. Since splitting up in 1982 after both sets of spouses divorced \u2013 giving rise to melancholic pop classics like The Winner Takes it All \u2013 Abba have had a lucrative afterlife. Their compilation Abba Gold, released in 1992, is the second-highest-selling album of all time in the UK and has sold 29m copies worldwide, while the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!, which employs many of their hits, has grossed some $2bn since its debut in 1999, and only recently completed its Broadway run. It was also made into a hit film, whose attractions included a memorable, if not downright searing, version of SOS performed by Pierce Brosnan. The famous quartet hadn\u2019t been seen out together since 2008. On Friday, they arrived and left separately and declined to be photographed together on the red carpet, though they stood beside one another on the stage. Housed in Stockholm\u2019s Tyrol restaurant, Mamma Mia! The Party is based on the Greek taverna in the musical. As well as Mediterranean food, it offers entertainment including \u2013 so the website says \u2013 \u201cdaredevil stunts, Greek Gods, flirty waiters, and perhaps a zorba and an ouzo or two\u201d. Fans are sure to take a chance on the new venture \u2013 though it seems the night could get mezze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
