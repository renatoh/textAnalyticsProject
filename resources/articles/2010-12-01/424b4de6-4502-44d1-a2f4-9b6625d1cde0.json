It's the same concept that dominates her next album, Ashore, but this adventurous concert was more than just a preview. She included songs from the album (which itself includes new versions of earlier material), mixed with unexpected treatments of other nautical songs from her repertoire, as well as new songs and readings. It was a reminder that she's one of the folk scene's great historians, capable of enthusiastically combining research and fine storytelling, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 that's she a singer who dares to mix experiment with emotion. For much of the set, she stood motionless, surrounded by four musicians including Andy Cutting on accordion and pianist Huw Warren, who switched from delicate, sometimes barely audible minimalism to jazz. There were bursts of quirky humour in her introductions, but the passion was kept for the music. She started with a gently powerful treatment of Ian Telfer's Finisterre, a song she first recorded with Oysterband 10 years ago, then continued the aquatic theme with a highly personal take on Elvis Costello's Shipbuilding, war songs in French, readings from CS Lewis, a vivid description of bird migration in the Shetlands, the bleak traditional love song I Will Put My Ship in Order and an unashamedly emotional treatment of Les Barker's Sudden Waves. Later came a late-night jazz ballad about Sinatra singing shanties, a brooding traditional shipwreck saga (Sir Patrick Spens) and an slow, exquisite treatment of the Caribbean shanty Shallow Brown. The variety was remarkable, and every song was treated with the same intensity and passion. Magnificent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
