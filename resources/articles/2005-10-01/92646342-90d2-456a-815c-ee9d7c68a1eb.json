The clothes are the livery of wood-panelled offices and the boardroom. They speak of money. This, presumably, is why the Dane quit Tottenham for the richest club in the world: for the chance to inflate his bank account and to infiltrate football's political elite. Arnesen bridles at the suggestion. \"It's not like I didn't earn anything before; I was not so poor before I got the offer from here,\" he said in his first interview since making the switch. \"I worked as a technical director at PSV [Eindhoven] and Tottenham for 11 years, with a lot of pressure, 75-80% of the job [was] administration, a lot of talking to people, players, agents. And 25% maximum directly on football, watching games and training. \"It's the opposite now. My job is 20-25% admin and the rest out looking for players. Already I have been more involved in football in one and a half months than I have been the last year.\" Despite the acrimony that accompanied his departure from Tottenham, who publicly berated Arnesen for what they considered to be perfidy, Chelsea's director of youth development and scouting insists relations with his former club are extremely cordial. Tottenham's tantrum cooled when Chelsea paid compensation reported to be \u00a38m and Arnesen seems faintly bemused by the fuss. \"I've been in football for 30 years,\" he said. \"You know that sometimes you get the sack, sometimes you stay and sometimes you go for some reason. That's football and that's why I don't think about guilt, or anything like that.\" Spurs' indignation was stoked to a climax on the publication of pictures showing Arnesen with Roman Abramovich aboard one of the Chelsea owner's yachts. So what happened on the boat where no one says no? \"I've known Peter Kenyon for years and years, dealing with him over Jaap Stam and G14 etc,\" said Arnesen. \"Roman and him talked about what their plan is and they said I could fit in the structure. [Abramovich] I can say is a very nice man. There are a number of things I like. He is very committed to football. \"He loves to see his games, he's involved and I like it when people are involved. Even if it's a young player he likes to know, and he asks about things. I didn't know him before and everybody wants to know about him but that is all I'd like to say about that.\" Arnesen's move, at last, signals the intention - to use the parlance of a former manager Claudio Ranieri - to put foundations under a house that has already been decorated. The Dane was responsible for the arrival of Ronaldo at PSV, but his recruitment policy will be centred principally on English players. Only John Terry, Carlton Cole, Robert Huth - imported from Germany as a 15-year-old - and the once-used goalkeeper Lenny Pidgeley are products of Chelsea's youth system. Arnesen's sights are set higher. \"It's a job I think that not a lot of clubs in this world could offer me,\" Arnesen said in reference to the potential for improvement at Chelsea's academy. \"If you are very good, you can get one player a year into the first team. So Peter, Jose and me, and the staff, our target will be [to do that] in maybe one or two years - and we have to reach it. Sometimes it can be two players one year and none the next. But in two years' time, the first has to have come through.\" The way Arnesen expressed his point suggests he possesses already the Chelsea instinct for teasing rival clubs. \"If only one of the players is coming into the squad, then the next one, of a little bit lower level is going to maybe Manchester United or Arsenal,\" he said with a grin as cheeky as his quip, \"and then they go on, but all the players who have been in a Premier League academy will be of benefit to football.\" Given Arnesen's previous experience, Kenyon might have felt his own remit to be threatened by the arrival of one at ease with negotiating with the world's top clubs, particularly after the Chelsea chief executive's difficulties in prising Michael Essien from Lyon in the summer. Yet with the instinct of a natural politician, Arnesen stressed he has no designs on Kenyon's role. \"With the big hot-shots, that is negotiations for Peter Kenyon,\" said Arnesen. \"He is my boss, he is the CEO, just as every club has a CEO, and I report to him.\" The man is as slick as his suits.
