Chelsea were also perplexed that the referee, Anthony Taylor, did not penalise the Arsenal forward for handball in the buildup. After that Aaron Ramsey\u2019s initial movement towards the ball from an offside position prompted the assistant referee, Gary Beswick, to raise his flag. Yet while Ramsey\u2019s presence may have been a distraction, the fact he did not touch the ball, directly interfere with an opponent or ensure his side gained an unfair advantage through his position meant Taylor eventually allowed the fifth-minute goal. \u201cThat offside rule is a crazy rule,\u201d said Cahill, who did admit Chelsea had been badly off the pace from the outset. \u201cYou can look to go to the ball and veer off and then you\u2019re not offside. It is the maddest rule I have ever seen. If he is not there, and it does not affect things, then maybe Thibaut [Courtois] comes out and grabs the ball. But there\u2019s also the handball. If he touches the ball with his hands in a natural position down by his side, I\u2019d understand that [being allowed]. But when you have both hands above your face, you\u2019re not telling me that is a natural position. It was incredible, to be honest. I spoke to him [the referee] at half-time and he was adamant he kneed the ball through. We saw it differently.\u201d Taylor had visited Chelsea\u2019s Cobham training ground earlier this season to explain to the players what would be considered handball. \u201cHe told us a player\u2019s hands should always be in a natural position,\u201d said Courtois. \u201cIf he has his hands next to him and the ball hits him on the arm, he can\u2019t do anything about it. But here he actually does a volleyball block. It\u2019s one of the best blocks I\u2019ve seen. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the offside, where Ramsey is clearly bothering me. If he\u2019s not there, I can run out and get the ball before Alexis does. But because he\u2019s standing there, I stop thinking he is going to collect it and shoot. As does the defence. He clearly interrupts the game for me and is taking part in active play. \u201cBut, to be honest, Arsenal were just better than us. We can\u2019t hide behind the first goal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
