The two finalists, Croatia and France, scored 14 each, while third-placed Belgium scored 16 \u2013 and they all played seven matches. After one game in the Women\u2019s World Cup USA! USA!! USA!!! have scored 13! Only six teams in Russia had more shots on target in the entire tournament than USA! USA!! USA!!! had against Thailand on Tuesday. Only half of the 32 teams had as many shots \u2013 off target, on target, whatever \u2013 as the 39 the USA! USA!! USA!!! took. Five teams left Russia having won fewer corners in their three group games put together than the 10 USA! USA!! USA!!! won (Thailand\u2019s two shots were however two more than Saudi Arabia managed in their 5-0 thumping by the hosts last year, so that\u2019s something). There have been thrashings before in major competitions, but this was a performance that left all other shellackings lacking. And after her team had been royally thumped 13-0 Thai coach, Nuengruethai Sathongwien, told the media that \u201cwe accept that they are better\u201d, as if there were perhaps still a few people in doubt. Some declared that the margin of victory proved the Women\u2019s World Cup to be in some way substandard or unworthy as a competition, rather than one in the relatively early stages of its development and with teams attempting to overcome huge disparities in funding and facilities as well as the amount of time they are able to dedicate to training, which was also true of the men\u2019s event a few decades back when South Korea, Zaire and El Salvador all experienced the wrong end of a nine-goal margin of victory, and it seems to have worked out OK for the blokes. But what it did prove is that USA! USA!! USA!!! have a desire for success which is perhaps a little excessive. A desire not just to beat opponents, to demonstrate their superiority, bank the available points and move on, but to leave them broken and weeping. A five-goal winning margin tells the world that one team is much better than another; a 13-goal winning margin tells the world that one team is so desperate to prove the extent of their superiority that they will cast aside such generally positive human traits as empathy and humility. \u201cTo be respectful to opponents is to play hard against them,\u201d said USA! USA!! USA!!! coach Jill Ellis. \u201cA lot of this is about building momentum and so as a coach I don\u2019t find it my job to rein my players in. When you get a deluge of goals like that, it\u2019s a good feeling. It builds confidence.\u201d The 2015 champions have proved themselves to be a great team, and also a hard one. Their performance will surely cast fear into their future opponents. And also, perhaps, some of their family members.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cAltrincham FC wish to announce that, unfortunately, it has been necessary to cancel the proposed Q&amp;A event featuring Fifa referee Anthony Taylor \u2026 as with any function organised to raise valuable funds for the club, it has to be financially viable.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: The Fiver\u2019s predictions in the Women\u2019s World Cup: Chile 0-2 Sweden, actual result: Chile 0 Sweden 2. USA! USA!! USA!!! 3-0 Thailand, actual result USA! USA!! USA!!! (1)3-0 Thailand. Absolutely uncanny and one in the eye for all those Fiver naysayers who laugh at all the failed predictions and don\u2019t laugh at all the failed jokes. Me included\u201d \u2013 Robert Darby (and others). \u201cIf Robert Newman struggled to find footage online of the D!cks/Schmeichel penalty, imagine my surprise when I tried to find footage of a ferocious tackle the same West Ham hardman made on Eric Cantona. Googling \u2018Cantona D!cks Challenge\u2019 gives you rather surprising results if you haven\u2019t been on social media for a while ...\u201d \u2013 James Maltby. \u201cTypical bloody FAI\u2014they can\u2019t even get the age-old tactic of parking the bus right! Instead, they turn a humdrum journey across Dublin into the Father Ted episode called Speed 3, where the bus can\u2019t go faster than 20 mph. As Dougal nearly stated at the end of said episode: \u2018Those FAI administrators are always in the nip!\u2019 And sometime soon, a brick will hit Mick McCarthy in the head (but to no avail)\u201c \u2013 Justin Kavanagh.
