Born in Vienna in 1881, he was a private composition pupil of Alexander von Zemlinsky from 1896, a close friend of Arnold Schoenberg, and a contemporary of Anton Webern in Guido Adler's class at the University of Vienna, but around 1910 his creative path diverged sharply from that of the fledgling Second Viennese School. While Schoenberg and his acolytes explored the terra incognita of atonality, Weigl preferred to stay within the confines of post-Wagnerian language. Before and after the first world war his career prospered: Weigl was an assistant conductor to Gustav Mahler at the Vienna Opera up to 1910 and became a professor of composition at the New Vienna Conservatory in 1918; for a while his own works were widely performed. But as a Jew with pronounced left-wing sympathies, he was forced to flee from Vienna in the wake of the Anschluss in 1938. He spent the decade before his death in 1949 in the US, teaching and producing a large quantity of music. Very little of that music has been recorded. The two works here, very well played by the Berlin Radio Symphony under Thomas Sanderling, come from sharply different parts of his career: the Phantastisches Intermezzo was composed in 1922, originally as a movement of his Second Symphony, while the Fifth Symphony dates from 1945, and is dedicated to Roosevelt. Without knowledge of that chronology one might place the works the other way around. Though the symphony begins with a strikingly original gesture, its opening theme emerging from the chaos of the orchestra tuning up, the four-movement plan is rooted in the 19th-century tradition and the material follows late-romantic lines. It is an increasingly sombre work: the second movement, titled The Dance Around the Golden Calf, is a heavyweight scherzo; the finale, The Four Horsemen, is a march whose remorseless bleakness is hardly dispelled by the explosion of bells with which it ends. The Intermezzo is far more polyglot and coloured: there are hints of Debussy, Ravel and even Scriabin; there is more decorative chromaticism, while the rhythmic shapes are less prescribed. Weigl clearly knew what was going on around him, even though he always knew where the heart of his music lay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
