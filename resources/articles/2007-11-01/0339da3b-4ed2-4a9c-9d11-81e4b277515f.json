But Simon Rattle's presentation of Mahler's Ninth Symphony, performed by the Berlin Philharmonic at New York's Carnegie Hall, fell foul of the oldest adversary of the classical repertoire: the cough. After completing the first movement to the muted and unscored accompaniment of coughing from the audience, the British conductor turned from the orchestra to remind the audience of its part in the performance. \"This piece starts with silence and returns to silence,\" he said. \"The audience can help to create the piece by remaining silent.\" But rather than dispensing advice, Rattle decided that the audience needed instruction. He produced a handkerchief from his pocket and demonstrated the correct way to muffle a cough. Suitably chastened, the audience - which one onlooker said had been fairly well behaved - did its best to perform its silent role without any mistakes for the remaining three movements. But as the piece reached the climactic final movement, which Mahler marked \"very slowly and held back\", the outside world intervened. The sound of a passing emergency vehicle disrupted what some have interpreted as the composer's vision of the afterlife. Unable to scold the siren, Rattle instead held the orchestra in silence for a few moments before completing the piece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
