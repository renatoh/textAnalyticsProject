I knew how to put the 415 cables together.\u201d There is much that is electrifying about this interview \u2013 the second of a four-part series \u2013 not least because it covers the period of the greatest structural economic reform in Australia\u2019s history. Kerry O\u2019Brien skilfully guides the world\u2019s greatest Treasurer through winning the 1983 election, the Accord, the floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the banking system and the complete rewrite of the Australian tax system which was done \u2013 as Keating relates in vivid detail \u2013 in an astonishingly intense five months. Keating has a vitriolic reputation, and we see some clips at the end of the interview of his most famous parliamentary put-downs \u2013 who knew he called Peter Costello the talking knee? Despite this, he is remarkably generous in his assessment of the other great characters of the era. He is kind to Bill Hayden, warm about Bill Kelty and positively admiring of Bob Johnson, then head of the Reserve Bank. Even the men (and they are all men) he has little time for \u2013 John Stone, head of Treasury and the titled, plum-in-the-mouth head of the NAB \u2013 are let off fairly lightly. However, it is in his discussion of his complex relationship with Bob Hawke that the interview really takes off. The collector of baroque clocks was not immediately smitten by the sinker of yard glasses. They met socially while Bob was still president of the ACTU and Keating dismisses him with \u201cHe was always a bit \u2026 well \u2026 rude.\u201d The relationship appeared to get worse before it got better, with Keating revealing that Hawke considered making Ralph Willis Treasurer when he first won government. We get a strong flavor of Keating\u2019s willingness and ability to exercise power when he tells O\u2019Brien: \u201cI said, Bob, you try and touch me as Treasurer and I will invoke the Harry Truman doctrine of massive retaliation.\u201d And that, one senses, was the end of that. But the relationship improved. Keating agrees wholeheartedly \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 when O\u2019Brien sums up the relationship between PM and Treasurer as \u201cHawke delivered the political capital and you used it up.\u201d He also talks quite movingly about the period when Hawke had to confront the news that his younger daughter was addicted to heroin, though it is not so much what he says that affected me as his facial expression. Keating \u2013 who earlier describes politics as a \u201csentimental business\u201d \u2013 was genuinely moved by the sufferings of his boss. It is the mark of the man, however, that despite his sympathy he claimed he quickly filled what he described as \u201cthe void\u201d that Hawke left over '85, '86 and '87. When confronted by O\u2019Brien about calling Hawke an \u201cenvious little bastard\u201d, he ruefully agrees that there was much \u201ckicking, shoving and gouging\u201d between the two of them, but he argues they always kept their eyes on the main game \u2013 \u201cwinning and moving the country forward.\u201d Keating even goes so far as to say that he always had affection for Bob. \u201cIn the end I was a soft touch for him and he was a soft touch for me.\u201d No doubt that is why they were such an effective team. It was towards the end of part two that the contrast between the politics of the '80s and today became stark. Keating described how he talked up to the community just as he would to a member of caucus. He spoke brilliantly about the power of the political metaphor, saying \u201cto speak to the community metaphorically about change \u2026 gives them a picture in which they can encapsulate an argument.\u201d What comes across so far in both parts of the interview is of a larger than life character. An autodidact, whose native intelligence, taste and curiosity gave him a freshness of approach and an originality that now seems to have been MBA\u2019d, PHD\u2019d and Rhodes-scholared out of existence. His analysis of the rapid-fire thought process that accompanies an MP standing to ask a question is a tour de force. He talks about the fun he had and clearly approached politics as a game to be fought and won but also enjoyed. Perhaps what he had that seems so utterly lacking from our cast of political characters today is creativity. His description of how he\u2019d get ideas listening to the great composers is wonderful. But his best moment for me came right at the end when he described how listening to great music kept him earthed. \u201cThe genius of the great composers means \u2013 sorry \u2013 but you\u2019ve missed out ... They pumped me up about the scale of it all but reminded me how ordinary it was. (We\u2019re) just bit players on a very large stage.\u201d I think he just described sanity and a sense of proportion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
