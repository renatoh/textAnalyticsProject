The players are trying to haul themselves to the eminence last attained when the club were the champions of 2004. It is absorbing to watch this emerging squad strive to cope with their own ambitions. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side is acclaimed for flowing football, but in the past two weekends they have scored winners from set-pieces. Mistakes by the visitors at corner kicks were punished as, first, a William Gallas' header beat Chelsea and, now, another from Nicklas Bendtner has defeated Tottenham. Wenger observes that this is a natural part of the repertoire, with tall men such as Emmanuel Adebayor and Bendtner on the scene. On Saturday, the latter had come straight off the bench to score in the 76th minute and the winner was a landmark for the 19-year-old Dane. \"It was fantastic,\" he said. \"First touch, first Premier League goal. People said to me that they don't remember that ever happening.\" Bendtner had been chivying the kit man, Vic Akers, to get him on before the corner was taken, promising he would score. The leap and the header were impressive, but even more noteworthy was the ease with which he darted away from his marker, Tom Huddlestone, to connect with Cesc F\u00e1bregas's delivery. Wenger reasoned that Arsenal had capitalised on the \"fraction of a second\" in which the visitors failed to adjust their man-to-man marking to deal with the introduction of Bendtner. For his opposite number, Juande Ramos, it was an intolerable blunder for any professional team to perpetrate. Nonetheless, he is bringing a more assiduous Tottenham into existence. The 21-year-old Jamie O'Hara, once on Arsenal's books, added poise and solidity to the midfield in his first start, and the visitors looked a match for the league leaders. Having fallen 1-0 behind, Tottenham pursued the equaliser with conviction. Robbie Keane ought to have found the net instead of the bar from an Aaron Lennon cross, but almost immediately Tottenham pulled level. Keane backheeled and Dimitar Berbatov finished with sweet power from a difficult angle after 66 minutes. Ramos' team might have gone on to notch an exceedingly rare victory over Wenger's Arsenal. There were a few cogent appeals for a penalty in the match and the referee Rob Styles granted one for Kolo Tour\u00e9's challenge on Berbatov. Keane, a captain newly returned from suspension, is reliable from the spot but his effort here was too gentle and rose sufficiently for Manuel Almunia to save in the 72nd minute. Bendtner's goal soon doubled the punishment. Arsenal's goalkeeper has his critics within the club. The deposed Jens Lehmann last week claimed he stuffs his hands in his pockets and bunches them in frustration when watching Almunia because he believes the latter is not held to a high standard by the manager. In public, Wenger is tolerant of this backbiting. He was asked how his two goalkeepers got along. \"They go on holiday together next week,\" he jested. He seems rather to like the uncomfortable situation. Of the 20 goalkeepers picked in the Premier League over the weekend, the Spaniard was one of just three who has never been capped. At 30, Almunia's attempt to make his name is belated. \"He came here without a CV,\" said Wenger. \"I knew he was good but how can he be Arsenal's keeper? Only by playing. He has never before played for a big club and he made mistakes, but he has gained confidence and calmness. He is a good keeper.\" Wenger will be content if Lehmann's disdain has hardened Almunia. Arsenal might ultimately buy someone else but the Spaniard is satisfactory for now. Indeed, the team as a whole is living up to its status. In each of the past three seasons the club heading the table at Christmas has gone on to take the title and Arsenal have hopes of extending the sequence. Any misgivings concern the depth of the squad and Tour\u00e9, in particular, will be missed when he goes to the African Cup of Nations next month. None the less, Arsenal have been good at problem- solving. Saturday's difficulty was the humdrum tone of the match, which the side transcended with Tomas Rosicky's dart, F\u00e1bregas's backheel and Adebayor's composed shot for the opener. Arsenal, mesmerising then, more often muddled their way through but that will reinforce the confidence that they can stay the course in this title bid.
