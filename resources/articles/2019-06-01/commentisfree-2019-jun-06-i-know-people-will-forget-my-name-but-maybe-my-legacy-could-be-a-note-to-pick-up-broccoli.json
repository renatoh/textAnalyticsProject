So for clothing, books and general household things, I head straight to secondhand stores. But if I\u2019m honest, this shopping choice isn\u2019t solely driven from an environmental standpoint. Between my career choices of social work, freelance writing and depression-related unemployment (the trifecta of financial success!), I\u2019ve always been a bit \u2026 skint. If you regularly frequent op shops you might have noticed two distinct groups of customers: trendy young people searching for vintage threads while vaguely appropriating working-class culture, or people a bit down and out needing a warm coat. I tend to straddle the two categories. Over the years I\u2019ve tried to make secondhand shopping fun and it has become a hobby of mine. I try on sweaters while secretly re-enacting a shopping montage from a 90s romcom while Shania Twain plays in my head. (Let\u2019s go girls). And lately I\u2019ve started visiting these stores regardless of whether I really need anything because I\u2019ve become hooked on one element of it all: the tiny historical items left behind by previous owners. I love excitedly reaching into the pockets of a trench or trouser \u2013 will I find a treasure? More often than not it\u2019s a tissue, but sometimes I find a gem. Not an actual gemstone, but a treasure nonetheless that offers an inkling into the previous owner\u2019s life. I\u2019ve become captivated by these tidbits accidentally left behind that reveal tiny hints about total strangers. Grocery lists, receipts and once even a long letter within a book (\u201cLaura honey, it\u2019s Robert \u2026 \u201d). The letter appeared to have been left on the dashboard of Laura\u2019s car from a hopeful friend wanting to atone for some sort of mistake. I read and reread the letter, savouring the perfect handwriting and desperately wanting a conclusion I knew I\u2019d never get. These small items \u2013 essentially rubbish \u2013 become precious gifts and my mind creates stories, desperately trying to assemble a puzzle from only one or two pieces. A faded receipt can trigger a dozen questions. Why did this person buy so many jugs of milk in October 2007? Was it for baking? Did they have several cats? Were they an eccentric retiree who bathed in only the finest organic milk? It grants me permission to be nosy. I purchased this coat fair and square, I\u2019m allowed to gleefully fossick in the pockets and see what I find! It\u2019s not weird! I love this part of thrift shopping almost as much as taking home a bargain. After all, it\u2019s different from peering between curtains at my neighbours with tiny binoculars. Isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s fun, if not a little peculiar, to form connections with other people in this way even though they\u2019ll never know about it. These mementoes create tangible reminders about human nature and sometimes remind us of our similarities (pasta sauce is a very common stain, and pet hair will NEVER leave tweed). Accidental keepsakes unintentionally left behind almost feel like secret diaries, or even clues. Who was Robert? Was he worthy of forgiveness? Did Laura ever contact him, or just bury the note in a book and forget about it? I\u2019ll never know, but it\u2019s fun to daydream. A former colleague once made a disgusted face when I mentioned that most of my clothes come from secondhand stores. She yelped, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it creep you out that it may have belonged to a dead person?!\u201d Honestly? No. Seeing the face of a tired older woman dropping off armfuls of men\u2019s suits at the Salvo\u2019s does, of course, make my heart twinge. It\u2019s also just the reality of life. At 30, I can\u2019t be certain what mark I\u2019ll leave on the world, but it will most likely be a small one. People will forget my name after a while, especially if I don\u2019t have children, and I\u2019m OK with that. Perhaps my only legacy will be a grocery list buried deep within the pocket of a trouser leg, reminding myself to pick up broccoli. A receipt from the chemist when I\u2019ve wandered in for my prescription and walked out with six anti-ageing skincare products I suspect don\u2019t actually work. Or maybe just a scrunched-up tissue that will resemble the face of the person who buys my coat, long after I stopped needing it, and reaches into the pocket. And there\u2019s something oddly reassuring about that. \u2022 Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on SBS Comedy, Junkee, the ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
