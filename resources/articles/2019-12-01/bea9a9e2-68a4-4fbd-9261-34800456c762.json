Sgt Christopher Brewster was killed in Houston on Saturday. At a briefing the same day, Acevedo paid tribute to Brewster, 32, who was shot repeatedly after responding to a call from a female victim who reported her boyfriend was assaulting her and was armed with two guns. A suspect, captured at a nearby school, was charged with capital murder. Acevedo clashed last week with Cornyn over why the Violence Against Women Act was stalled in the Senate, which Republicans control. He returned to the subject on Monday, speaking to reporters before police provided an escort for Brewster\u2019s body. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the Violence Against Women Act acted upon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get in a room. I don\u2019t want to hear about how much they support law enforcement, how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives. \u201cAnd yet we all know in law enforcement that this is one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House, and getting the Violence Against Women Act, is because the NRA doesn\u2019t like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends.\u201d The NRA says the act\u2019s definition of domestic abuse is too broad. Experts disagree. \u201cAnd who killed our sergeant?\u201d Acevedo asked. \u201cA boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you\u2019re either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you\u2019re here for the NRA.\u201d Growing more emotional, he continued: \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to see their little smug faces about how much they care about law enforcement when I\u2019m burying a sergeant because they don\u2019t want to piss off the NRA. \u201cMake up your minds. Whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers? The gun lobby? Or the children who are getting gunned down in this country every single day? In our schools, in our theatres, in our colleges, on our streets, in our homes, in our businesses. Who are you coming to work for?\u201d The Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994, lapsed during last year\u2019s government shutdown. The Democratic-controlled House reauthorised it in April, adding protections for transgender victims and banning those convicted of domestic abuse from buying guns. Responding to Acevedo\u2019s comments last week, Cornyn referred to Donald Trump\u2019s current predicament when he said: \u201cUnfortunately, legislation like this has fallen casualty to impeachment mania.\u201d The Senate has not yet had to act on impeachment, as House committees continue to stage hearings before staging a formal vote. On Monday Acevedo rejected Cornyn\u2019s argument. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me, senator, with all due respect, it\u2019s about the impeachment. Because you brag every day, you and Mitch McConnell, about getting judges confirmed. You brag about every piece of legislation you care about. \u201cStart caring about cops, children and women and everyday gun violence. And that will be the last thing I say this week, because the rest of this week is going to be about Christopher Brewster and his sacrifice.\u201d Cornyn did not immediately comment. Nor did the NRA. \u201cYou are an American, and American blood is being shed every day in this community throughout this nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cDo something about it or retire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
