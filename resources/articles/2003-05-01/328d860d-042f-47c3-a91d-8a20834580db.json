In addition to emotional pain, I suffer from a feeling of intense claustrophobia when I think I'll never talk to my former partner again. Please help, Linda.' Thousands of emails come every week, but this one stopped me because treating broken hearts is one of my specialities. I remember as a student of Oriental medicine being utterly amazed watching my teacher successfully treat someone for a broken heart using acupuncture. It was proof that adjusting the levels of energy in your various vital organs can positively affect your emotional and mental state. But, as the expression 'broken heart' demonstrates, this is not just an Oriental concept. In the West we talk, for example, about being livid when angry, as in being overheated in the liver, the cause of anger, according to the Taoists, or giving vent to one's spleen, as in speaking your mind, the spleen being thought responsible for providing you with intellectual power, and we talk about having a broken heart. But, in fact, your heart cannot get broken - what actually happens, energetically at least, is a major disruption in the flow of so-called 'heart protector' energy. This, if you go with the Taoist approach, is an energetic sheath surrounding your heart, akin in Western medical thought, to your pericardium - there to protect your heart from painful information, as occurs when you're forced to part company permanently with someone you love deeply. Your heart is said to support your spirit, or consciousness, and to hold it in your body. When the energy of your heart protector becomes momentarily ruptured by trauma and shock, the heart energy itself is effectively weakened and loses control of your consciousness, which moves up out of your body and into your brain, where it gets stuck in a claustrophobic loop of self-punishing thoughts. 'I'll never meet anyone who loves me or who I'll love again; I'm useless, undesirable and unworthy; my life (which was probably perfectly fine before I met this person), will fall apart now; my life is meaningless; the light's gone out of it; I'd rather be dead' - these are all perfectly understandable thoughts for someone whose spirit, the font of life itself, has gone Awol. In fact, it is your own spirit leaving, not the other person, which actually causes these feelings, and as soon as you mend the break in the heart-protector energy and your spirit returns to your body, those awful feelings and thoughts evaporate. One way to do it is as follows: start off by spending 50 quid on a damn good massage as this will instantly draw you out of your head and back into your body. Then spend a few moments roughly six times a day, pressing fairly firmly between the two tendons that run up the midline of the underneath part of each forearm approximately three watchstraps' width up from the wrist bracelet. When you hit it accurately your hand will feel pleasantly paralysed. Stimulate this point (on the heart-protector meridian) as above for three days and the energy will mend itself. More crucially, though, use this whole episode as an opportunity for you to reacquaint yourself with yourself. For after all, it's you you came on to the planet with, it's you you experience all the ups and downs of life with, and it's you you leave the planet with when the story's finally over. In other words, it's you with whom you have your primary relationship, however distracted from it you may have been by any secondary relationships with others, so spend some time falling in love with yourself again. Then pick yourself up, dust yourself down, put on your finest party outfit, go out and dance (metaphorically and literally), and before you know it, those suitors will be banging on your door once more and the whole chest-churning fairground ride can start all over again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
