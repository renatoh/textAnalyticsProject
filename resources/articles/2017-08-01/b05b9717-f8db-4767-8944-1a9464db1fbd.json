Heyer, whose Facebook cover photo read: \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention\u201d, worked for the Virginia law firm Miller Law and regularly drew attention to cases of police malpractice and racism, as well as posting her support for Bernie Sanders in his presidential campaign. A friend from childhood, Felicia Correa, who launched a crowdfunding page and said she was speaking for Heyer\u2019s mother, who was not ready to speak in public, said: \u201cShe died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\u201d Her boss at the law firm said she had attended Saturday\u2019s counter-demonstration to send a clear message to neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan sympathizers that people in her hometown abhor their views. She was \u201ca very strong, very opinionated young woman\u201d who \u201cmade known that she was all about equality\u201d, Alfred Wilson told Reuters. However, it was testimony to the bitterness of the local situation that among scores of tributes to Heyer\u2019s principles and courage, several people posted comments laying equal blame on the anti-racist and civil rights groups as on the neo-Nazi and far-right groups whose planned rally they were demonstrating against. The crowdfunding page to raise money for her family has already far exceeded its $50,000 target, with almost 3,000 people donating within 11 hours, many leaving tributes describing her as a hero. Sheryl Hodge wrote: \u201cWe are so sad and outraged. We will not let Heather go in vain.\u201d George Christos said: \u201cVery sad that our country continues to see this hatred and that a young life was lost as a result.\u201d Her friends were organising a candlelit vigil in her memory on Sunday night. Heyer came from Greene County, one of the smallest counties in Virginia, where she graduated from William Monroe high school \u2013 motto \u201cEvery child, every chance, every day\u201d \u2013 and kept in touch with her alumni from the class of 2003. The school was originally founded from money left by William Monroe, an 18th-century immigrant from England, to provide free education for white children, but it now posts a firm commitment on its website against discrimination \u201con the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age in its programs and activities\u201d. Heyer\u2019s second last Facebook post, in October 2016, was a link to a site urging those fearful of Muslims to meet and befriend one. Since it was still open, hundreds of people added comments to it, most expressing admiration for her and condolences to her family, but a few \u2013 who instantly attracted outraged reactions \u2013 blamed her for being at the rally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
