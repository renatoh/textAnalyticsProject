Their destination was an island group named Morant Cays \u2013 a popular haunt for fishermen about seven hours from home. Patrick Ferguson, who owned the Jossette, planned on retrieving catches from fish traps that were set several days before the men departed. The rest of the crew \u2013 Robert Weir, Luther Patterson, David Williams and George Thompson \u2013 were going to help with these traps, while also angling for tuna and snapper. They traveled simply, packing their fishing gear, overnight bags and a change of clothes. Ferguson\u2019s fighting rooster, Jah Roos, also came along. They only expected to be gone one day. Instead, they wound up chained to the decks of four US Coast Guard ships for more than a month, a new lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges. They were stripped naked, had their boat burned and were then taken to Florida where they were charged with drugs offenses \u2013 which were later dropped. The men were gone for a year. At first, their families assumed they had died at sea. The ACLU says the men were ensnared under the Coast Guard\u2019s \u201cunlawful detention and mistreatment policy\u201d that \u201cramped up in 2012 as part of the United States\u2019 \u2018war on drugs.\u2019\u201d It said: \u201cUnder this policy, the Coast Guard stops boats in international waters, searches them and their crew for drugs, destroys boats, and detains crew members for prolonged periods of time in inhumane conditions, regardless of whether any drugs are found aboard.\u201d It began when the boat got lost. Shortly after daybreak a day after they left Jamaica, the wayward crew headed toward a distant land mass in the hope of finding their way \u2013 not realizing it was Haiti. A coastguard ship named Confidence spotted the Jossette. Officials said the men were spotted throwing packages of marijuana off their boat \u2013 something the men deny. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, says: \u201cThe officers wrongly suspected the boat and its crew were involved in trafficking drugs, and dispatched four armed Coast Guard officers in a high-powered speedboat to stop, board, and search the Jossette and its crew.\u201d The Jossette was intercepted at about noon as three Coast Guard officers on the speedboat had their guns pointed at the fisherman, the ACLU suit states. The fishermen told officers they were from Jamaica and had got lost. They provided ID and registration documents. The men and Jossette were searched, and no drugs were found, the ACLU alleges. But a Coast Guard officer said they were to be taken on to the Confidence and detained. \u201cShocked by this turn of events, the men initially refused to leave their boat,\u201d court papers say. \u201cBut when the officers pointed guns at them, they complied. Each of the men took his overnight bag and got into the speedboat.\u201d Two officers found Jah Roos, the rooster \u201cand, after obtaining orders to do so from their Commanding Officer, killed the bird\u201d. \u201cThe officers forced them to strip naked,\u201d providing them only with \u201cwhite paper-thin coveralls and a pair of thin, disposable slippers\u201d, according to the suit. The Jossette\u2019s crew was brought to the bow, \u201cwhere the officers chained each of them by one of their ankles to metal cables that ran the breadth and length of the ship\u2019s deck,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Thirty men were already detained at the bow. \u201cAll were dressed in the same white coveralls, and chained by one of their ankles to the metal cables affixed to the deck.\u201d When night fell, the Jossette\u2019s crew, still chained to the deck, \u201cwatched in disbelief as a Coast Guard officer fired a flare at the Jossette. The boat burst into flames and then sank after Coast Guard officers riddled its hull with bullets,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. They remain ankle-chained to Confidence\u2019s bow for four days, and were freed from the cable only \u201cto relieve themselves in buckets or over the side of the ship.\u201d Their only protection from the elements was a plastic tarpaulin hung over them. The Confidence stopped at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the men were brought on to the second of four ships where, for one month, they allegedly endured inhumane conditions. They finally arrived in Miami a month later, where each of the men pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. Those drugs charges did not stick. But the men pleaded guilty to \u201cknowingly and intentionally provid[ing] materially false information to a federal law enforcement officer during a boarding of a vessel regarding the vessel\u2019s destination\u201d, court papers state. The ACLU suit says: \u201cThey pleaded guilty because they were told that it was the quickest and surest way to get back to their homes and families in Jamaica and to put an end to their nightmare.\u201d They were sentenced to 10 months in US prison, and deported in autumn 2018. In a statement the US Coast Guard said the men had been detained because its staff \u201cobserved the crew of the vessel jettison numerous packages of marijuana\u201d, some of which it recovered from the sea. \u201cAll suspects are cared for humanely while preserving the security of both the crew and suspects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
