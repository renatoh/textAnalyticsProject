It says the refusal was based on a credit scoring system, and invites me to contact Experian if I'm not happy with the decision. I've not asked for credit from anyone in recent years, and have never had any dealings with MBNA. There are no telephone or email contact details for MBNA in the letter, and BT's directory service does not have any record of MBNA at the address given. Is this a scam? Should I write to MBNA and Experian to establish what is going on, or will this provide additional information to a criminal? WG A I can't imagine the genuine MBNA Europe would omit its contact details from correspondence sent to you. In fact, UK company law dictates that any company writing to you must do so on headed paper and include its registered address, which may be completely different from its trading address, and its VAT number. Should you wish to contact the bona fide company, the number to call is 0800 062062, which won't cost you anything to ring. Alternatively you could write to MBNA's customer services department at MBNA Europe Bank Ltd, PO Box 1004, Chester Business Park, Wrexham Road, Chester CH4 9WW, and explain your concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
