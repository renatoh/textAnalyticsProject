Grant, who is Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous Affairs editor, made the comments to the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night after being asked \u201cWhat do you think of Noel Pearson\u2019s regret that he did not enter politics some years ago? Would you consider seeking election in the federal parliament?\u201d Grant replied that the response to a speech he gave last year on Indigenous Australians which went viral, prompted him to think about entering federal politics. \u201cThe response to the speech that I gave, I found so overwhelming and overwhelmingly positive,\u201d Grant said. \u201cTo be honest, it blew me away in the first few days ... the ground sort of shifted beneath my feet. Clearly, there is a responsibility and obligation to the words in that speech.\u201d In his speech given to the Ethics Centre in Sydney last year, Grant told the audience that racism is \u201cat the heart of the Australian dream\u201d, as he delivered a sobering speech about the impact of colonisation and discrimination on Indigenous people and their ancestors. While there had been no solid offers to enter federal politics, \u201cit is in my thoughts\u201d, Grant told Q&amp;A. \u201c[Whether it\u2019s] federal politics or advocacy or staying in the media and continuing to do what I do. This is a great country and my people still suffer in this country.\u201d It follows comments made by Pearson during an address to the National Press Club last week that he regretted not going into politics 15 years ago, as he felt he had \u201chit the limit of how much influence you can have barking from the outside\u201d. Grant\u2019s openness to entering politics generated a positive response on Twitter. On Tuesday morning, Labor Senator Penny Wong told ABC radio that Grant would be \u201ca fine addition to federal parliament\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
