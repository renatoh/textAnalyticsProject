That's partly because, for all the enthusiasm he expresses for the music in a sleeve note, Fabio Romano doesn't seem to me to be a natural Schumann interpreter; his account of the inexplicably neglected Nachtst\u00fccke Op 21 seems rather laboured and self-conscious, and that of the late Ges\u00e4nge der Fr\u00fche a little too brusque for music that needs gentle, sympathetic treatment. Romano seems far more at home in Widmann's Toccata, written as a competition test piece, which puts the pianist efficiently enough through a repertoire of modish gestures \u2013 fierce clusters, manically repeated notes, percussive sounds, and lingering silences. Fleurs du Mal shares some of the same sound world, but integrates it with more traditionally pianistic material, lush figuration and fathomlessly deep pedal notes, before climaxing in an explosive moto perpetuo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
