The former Texas congressman was trailing in polls and lacked funding. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $20.5tn plan to fund Medicare for all, without a middle-class tax hike. She figures the money can be raised through higher levies on capital gains and other investments and new taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Americans, among other things. Joe Biden criticized the plan, saying that Warren is \u201cmaking it up,\u201d Biden slipped to fourth in Iowa \u2014 the first caucus state \u2014 trailing Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The Democratic candidates have all converged in Des Moines for a party fundraising dinner that has become known as a launching pad for winning candidates. Nancy Pelosi predicted public impeachment hearings would begin this month, but the House speaker emphasized that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad\u201d. Donald Trump said that Chad Wolf was the new acting DHS secretary. A DHS spokesperson said Wolf is not the acting secretary. Confusion ensued. Trump is holding a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally in Mississippi, after initially telling Louisiana \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d National security officer Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he told by a White House lawyer to keep quiet about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. But the energy secretary may not show up to his deposition. According to CNN: Department of Energy spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said Perry will not participate in the closed-door deposition. \u201cThe secretary will not partake in a secret star chamber inquisition where agency counsel is forbidden to be present,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cIf the committee is interested in conducting a serious proceeding they are welcome to send for the secretary\u2019s consideration an invitation to participate in an open hearing where the Department\u2019s counsel can be present and the American people can witness.\u201d Rick Perry, the energy secretary, is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, according to reports. Perry resigned in October amid the Ukraine scandal. He has said that he urged Donald Trump to make the phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry to offer Ukraine \u201can alternative to Russian gas\u201d \u2013 saying the whole affair had nothing to do with Joe Biden or his son Hunter. Maybe Chad Wolf isn\u2019t DHS acting secretary after all... According to the White House Pool reporters, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson contradicted Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Chad Wolf is \u201cright now acting\u201d secretary. Kevin McAleenan remains the acting secretary and Wolf is the acting undersecretary for policy, the spokesperson reportedly said. Stay tuned as we attempt to clarify. National Security official testified that he was asked to keep mum A White House lawyer instructed national security official Alexander Vindman not to discuss he concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy with anyone outside the White House, the Washington Post reports: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified that he received this instruction from John Eisenberg, the top legal adviser for the National Security Council, after White House lawyers learned July 29 that a CIA employee had anonymously raised concerns about the Trump phone call, the sources said. The directive from Eisenberg adds to an expanding list of moves by senior White House officials to contain, if not conceal, possible evidence of Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to provide information that could be damaging to former vice president Joe Biden. 2020 candidates thank Beto O\u2019Rourke for his gun control advocacy After a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people, the former congressman redoubled his commitment to ending gun violence. During his campaign, O\u2019Rourke found himself at odds with some of his running mates. Fellow Texan Juli\u00e1n Castro criticized O\u2019Rouke\u2019s immigration policies, sparring with him during a June debate. \u201cI think you should do your homework on this issue,\u201d Castro told O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke has not endorsed any of the other candidates. \u201cI can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I\u2019m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is,\u201d he said in a statement. Wolf will be the fifth person to lead the department since Donald Trump took office. Trump announced recently that acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan was leaving his post. This news was first reported by Politico, and confirmed by NPR. Trump confirmed that Wolf could take the position. According to White House pool reporters, the president said: \u201cWell he\u2019s right now acting and we\u2019ll see what happens. We have great people in there.\u201d Per NPR: Wolf would seem to be a less controversial choice than others, in that he has not publicly espoused the hard-line views on immigration that the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli has, for instance. Some advocates for immigration restrictions have raised concerns about Wolf\u2019s prior work as a lobbyist on H-1B and other employment visas - programs that Trump has opposed. Wolf would become the latest person in charge at DHS \u201cwho is not completely on board\u201d with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, said RJ Hauman, head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \u201cIf officially named, Wolf must recuse himself from work on all guest worker related issues, not just H-1B and L-1,\u201d Hauman said. Beto O\u2019Rourke was once a front runner in the Democratic primaries, who raised huge amounts of money from small donors across the country. When he ran for US senator, he earned an endorsement of Barack Obama and energized the democratic base before he narrowly lost to incumbent Ted Cruz in the Republican stronghold of Texas. But O\u2019Rourke is not expected to run for the Senate again. It\u2019s unclear what his political future holds. Following in the footsteps of Joan Didion, and Meghan Daum and Luc Sante \u2013 Donald Trump has penned his own version of the \u201cGoodbye New York\u201d essay after announcing yesterday that he had changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-lago. \u201cI love New York, but New York can never be great again,\u201d he begins. Like so many bigly figures in the literary world, Trump has written about that bittersweet feeling of leaving the iconic city. For Trump, the decision to leave stems, he writes, from his disappointment with the \u201ccurrent leadership of Governor Andrew Cuomo (the brother of Fredo), or Mayor Bill DeBlasio\u201d. Moreover, Trump continued, \u201cUpstate is being allowed to die as other nearby states frack &amp; drill for Gold (oil) while reducing taxes &amp; creating jobs by the thousands.\u201d He lamented, \u201cNYC is getting dirty &amp; unsafe again.\u201d Echoing Didion, who described the city as \u201can infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself\u201d, Trump concluded that he wants this \u201cwonerful (sic) City and State to flourish and thrive.\u201d \u201cI Love New York!\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,\u201d he said in a statement. The former Texas congressman has suffered low polling numbers and his campaign has been under financial strain. \u201cThough it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. He had not met the thresholds for participating in the upcoming debates in November and December. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden attacked Elizabeth Warren following the release of her $20.5tn plan to fund Medicare for all, claiming the Massachusetts senator was \u201cmaking it up\u201d on the cost estimate of the proposal. A new poll showed Biden slipping to fourth in Iowa \u2013 narrowly trailing Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg in the first caucus state. Nancy Pelosi predicted public impeachment hearings would begin this month, but the House speaker emphasized that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad\u201d. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he was instructed by a White House lawyer not to discuss Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Maanvi will have plenty more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Some of my Guardian colleagues will be anchoring the blog next week as I travel to Iowa to report on the Democratic presidential primary, so enjoy their coverage \u2013 and have a wonderful weekend! Joe Biden has now personally weighed in on the release of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion plan to fund her Medicare for all proposal, and his response boils down to: you\u2019re full of it. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d Biden told PBS NewsHour. \u201cNobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between $30 and $40 trillion.\u201d The former vice president once again offered Bernie Sanders the backhanded compliment of recognizing that Medicare for all would require tax increases on the middle class. \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have to go that route,\u201d Biden added. \u201cAll we have to do is go back, restore Obamacare, provide a public option.\u201d Biden noted that his plan could be implemented immediately if passed, while Warren and Sanders have proposed transitional periods to shift to a single-payer system. Elizabeth Warren defended her newly released plan to fund Medicare for all after Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released a statement accusing the Massachusetts senator of proposing a roundabout way to tax the middle class in order to pay for the sweeping policy. Warren emphasized that the cost and revenue projections outlined in the plan were authenticated by former senior Obama administration officials. She said: \u201cSo if Joe Biden doesn\u2019t like that, I\u2019m just not sure where he\u2019s going.\u201d Warren argued that her plan built on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and added: \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points.\u201d At least one of the Washington Nationals, relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, does not intend to visit the White House to celebrate the team\u2019s World Series championship. The White House announced earlier today that the Nationals would meet with the president on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory, but some winning sports teams have opted out of the traditional visit since Trump took office. When the Boston Red Sox won the World Series last year, most of the team\u2019s minority players chose not to participate in the White House visit, while most of the team\u2019s white players met with Trump. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d the House would vote to impeach Trump. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Conway went on to attack House Democrats for pursuing an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d investigation and argued the passage of the impeachment resolution did not alter the illegitimacy of the inquiry. Conway sarcastically asked: \u201cDo you think you can actually apply due process retroactively?\u201d She also applauded the two House Democrats who voted with every House Republican to oppose the impeachment resolution. Nancy Pelosi said on Capitol Hill yesterday that the procedures outlined in the resolution were \u201cfairer than anything that have gone before in terms of an impeachment proceeding.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s campaign raised $5.3 million last month as Trump repeated false corruption claims against the former vice president and his son, Hunter. The AP reports: The swell of cash was raised from 182,000 donors who made an average donation of about $28, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. It comes after his internet fundraising operation stumbled over the summer, leading critics to suggest he lacked grassroots support for his campaign. \u2018All of the Trump attacks have started to catalyze. More people understand what is at stake,\u2019 deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh said in an interview. \u2018People out there are seeing Joe Biden getting attacked day after day. They understand he needs to fight back.\u2019 The fundraising boost comes amid growing anxiety over Biden\u2019s campaign from would-be allies in the Democratic establishment, who have fretted about his prospects following underwhelming debate performances, middling fundraising success and withering attacks from rivals in his own party and from Trump. Trump\u2019s baseless attacks may continue to provide momentum to Biden\u2019s campaign, especially given that the impeachment inquiry will soon advance to public hearings. If witnesses publicly confirm that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, it could incentivize voters to offer the former vice president their support -- and maybe even some donations. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is reportedly closing her three field offices in New Hampshire as her campaign devotes the vast majority of its resources to Iowa. Harris\u2019 campaign said in an internal memo earlier this week that it was pursuing a massive overhaul in response to the candidate\u2019s dwindling fundraising and polling numbers. A number of employees in Harris\u2019 Baltimore headquarters are being laid off, and many campaign staffers have been redeployed to Iowa. However, the California senator is still struggling to gain traction in the first caucus state. A new poll out today showed Harris hitting only 3 percent in Iowa. Impeachment investigators have scheduled two more depositions next week. They intend to speak to Wells Griffith, the senior director for international energy and environment at the national security council, and Michael Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at the office of management and budget, on Tuesday. Duffey was previously asked to testify in the impeachment inquiry, but his boss at OMB, Russ Vought, tweeted that no one from the agency would be cooperating with the investigation. Given that it seems unlikely Griffith or Duffey will appear for the depositions, House Democrats appear to be running out of witnesses willing to cooperate with the investigation before it advances to public hearings. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he was told not to discuss Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Politico reports: [Vindman] told lawmakers that he went to the [White House] lawyer, John Eisenberg, to register his concerns about the call, in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, according to a person in the room for Vindman\u2019s deposition on Tuesday. Eisenberg recorded Vindman\u2019s complaints in notes on a yellow legal pad, then conferred with his deputy Michael Ellis about how to handle the conversation because it was clearly \u2018sensitive,\u2019 Vindman testified. The lawyers then decided to move the record of the call into the NSC\u2019s top-secret codeword system\u2014a server normally used to store highly classified material that only a small group of officials can access. Vindman did not consider the move itself as evidence of a cover-up, according to a person familiar with his testimony. But he said he became disturbed when, a few days later, Eisenberg instructed him not to tell anyone about the call\u2014especially because it was Vindman\u2019s job to coordinate the interagency process with regard to Ukraine policy. Einsenberg\u2019s alleged instruction not to discuss the call will likely be cited by House Democrats as evidence of a cover-up by the Trump White House. Eisenberg will almost certainly be asked about this direction to Vindman if he shows up for his deposition with impeachment investigators on Monday -- although it remains unclear whether the White House lawyer will actually appear. Trump has announced that he intends to nominate Stephen Hahn as the next commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The Washington Post reports: But in a surprise move, acting FDA commissioner Norman \u2018Ned\u2019 Sharpless, will immediately return to his previous position as the director of the National Cancer Institute, and Brett Giroir, a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services, will oversee the FDA until Hahn is confirmed, according to individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Sharpless has been acting commissioner since April, when the previous commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stepped down. However, Sharpless\u2019 term as acting agency head expires Friday. His time at FDA could be extended only if the White House officially nominated a successor, which it cannot do because the Hahn paperwork isn\u2019t finished, according to people familiar with the situation. If confirmed, Hahn, the chief medical officer of Houston\u2019s MD Anderson Cancer Center, will help oversee the FDA\u2019s efforts to crack down on vaping. Trump announced back in September that his administration would ban most flavors of e-cigarettes, but the FDA has not yet issued its policy on the matter. Democratic presidential candidates have started arriving in Des Moines for tonight\u2019s Liberty and Justice Dinner, a major campaign event in the first caucus state. The dinner comes on the same day that a poll was released showing a tight race in Iowa \u2014 with Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading over Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden. Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro announced this morning that his campaign had met its goal to raise $800,000 in the last ten days of October. Maya Rupert, Castro\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement: \u201cWe set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro\u2019s voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date. ... We will keep lifting up important issues others choose to ignore, and demonstrating by example why Secretary Castro is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump.\u201d Castro\u2019s team said last month that the former San Antonio mayor and cabinet secretary would have to drop out of the race unless the campaign saw a spike in fundraising. Fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker pulled the same gimmick a month earlier and also met his fundraising goal. In her Bloomberg interview, Nancy Pelosi downplayed the likelihood of a government shutdown as the impeachment inquiry advances to a more public stage. The House speaker said of the Trump administration: \u201cThey don\u2019t care about shutdowns because they don\u2019t believe in government. However I do think that they learned a lesson from the last shutdown, since it didn\u2019t do them very well.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer suggested earlier this week that Trump might force a shutdown to distract from the impeachment investigation. The New York Democrat told reporters: \u201cHe always likes to create diversions.\u201d Paula White, the president\u2019s personal pastor who has just joined the administration, is promoting a book in which she details her long friendship with Trump. In a Washington Examiner interview about the book, White claimed that Trump once proposed building a glass cathedral for her ministry. \u201cHe wanted to build a house of God,\u201d White said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s build this before we\u2019re too old.\u201d Trump\u2019s relationship with White has previously caused consternation among some of his evangelical supporters, and her new role in the White House will surely only escalate those tensions. The New York Times reported yesterday: Ms. White will work in the Office of Public Liaison, the official said, which is the division of the White House overseeing outreach to groups and coalitions organizing key parts of the president\u2019s base. Her role will be to advise the administration\u2019s Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which Mr. Trump established last year by executive order and which aims to give religious groups more of a voice in government programs devoted to issues like defending religious liberty and fighting poverty. As Mr. Trump campaigns for a second term, he cannot afford to lose support from the religious conservatives who voted for him in 2016 in significant numbers. Without their backing, his path to re-election would be significantly narrower. ... But Ms. White cannot be easily categorized as either a political asset or a liability. She has a large following among Christians who believe in the \u2018prosperity gospel,\u2019 which teaches that God blesses people he deems to be of strong faith with wealth, good health and other gifts. But many other Christians consider these beliefs to be heresy. And Ms. White\u2019s presence in the top tier of Mr. Trump\u2019s coterie of informal religious advisers has long been a source of contention with many evangelical Christians. For more on White, read Jessica Glenza\u2019s piece on her from earlier this year. In her Bloomberg News interview, Nancy Pelosi predicted that public hearings in the impeachment inquiry would begin this month. The House speaker said: \u201cI would assume there would be public hearings in November.\u201d Pelosi added that impeachment investigators would continue closed-door depositions as long as the interviews are \u201cproductive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the timetable will be -- the truth will set us free,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cWe have not made any decisions on if the president will be impeached.\u201d Pelosi noted that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, also told PBS NewsHour yesterday that transcripts from the closed-door depositions may be released as soon as early next week. Speaking to Bloomberg News, Nancy Pelosi questioned the wisdom of supporting Medicare for all, arguing that Obamacare was a better option. The House speaker said in an interview: \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of Medicare for all.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s comments come just hours after Elizabeth Warren released her plan to fund Medicare for all by raising taxes on the wealthy and redirecting spending on private insurance. In a statement criticizing Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to fund Medicare for all, a senior adviser to Joe Biden accused the Massachusetts senator of proposing an indirect tax on the middle class to pay for the sweeping policy. Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, argued that Warren\u2019s proposal to raise $8.8 trillion by redirecting most of employers\u2019 spending on healthcare to the federal government amounted to a tax on the middle class. Bedingfield said: \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does. Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren released her $20.5 trillion plan to pay for Medicare for all, insisting she could avoid tax hikes on the middle class by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Joe Biden has slipped to fourth in Iowa, according to a new poll of the first caucus state. Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are narrowly beating him as the race has become tighter than ever. Senior House Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, said they will \u201csoon\u201d initiate public hearings and transcript releases in the impeachment inquiry. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. The White House has just announced it will host the Washington Nationals, the 2019 World Series champions, on Monday. The announcement comes less than a week after Trump was booed at Nationals Park, as the team was facing the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the World Series. After booing the president, the crowd broke out in a chant of, \u201cLock him up!\u201d Washington is an overwhelmingly Democratic town, and there had been predictions that Trump would not be well received by the Nationals\u2019 fans, but the chant still caused much hand-wringing among certain political commentators. One Republican congressman, Don Young of Alaska, is pursuing a new strategy for responding to questions about the impeachment inquiry: headbutting the camera. The longtime lawmaker was being repeatedly asked by activists from the progressive group MoveOn.org whether it was acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to interfere in an election, as Trump is alleged to do. As one of Young\u2019s staffers tried to direct the activists to his press secretary, the congressman approached the camera and collided with it before saying, \u201cThere you go.\u201d This unusual evasion tactic is not likely to please the president, who has urged Republican lawmakers to attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry. Headbutting cameras is probably not what Trump had in mind. Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia, is back on Capitol Hill after testifying in the impeachment inquiry. Hill reportedly told impeachment investigators last month that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, oversaw a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit Trump. Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at some of his Democratic primary opponents hours after Elizabeth Warren announced her plan to fund \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The former vice president advertised the beginning of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment, warning that \u201cmany Americans can\u2019t afford to wait for far off promises.\u201d Warren said she would soon release a plan on how the country can shift from its current healthcare system to a single-payer framework, and it\u2019s unclear whether the transitional period would be shorter or longer than the four years proposed by Bernie Sanders. Bennet not sold on Warren plan at all Colorado Senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Michael Bennet isn\u2019t impressed with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s mathematics on Medicare for all, the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters writes. \u201cVoters are sick and tired of politicians promising them things that they know they can\u2019t deliver,\u201d Bennet said in a statement just earlier today. \u201cWarren\u2019s new numbers are simply not believable and have been contradicted by experts. Regardless of whether it\u2019s $21 trillion or $31 trillion, this isn\u2019t going to happen, and the American people need health care,\u201d it continued. Bennet hasn\u2019t qualified for the more recent Democratic primary debates but is still out on the trail. Instead of Medicare for all, the progressive plan for universal US health insurance paid for by the government, Bennet favors a more moderate public option that would give Americans the option to buy a government plan or keep their private sector insurance. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, told Fox News that the White House feels no need to create an impeachment war room because of the president\u2019s own messaging against the inquiry. Grisham said of Trump: \u201cHe is the war room.\u201d Asked when she might hold her first press briefing, Grisham, who assumed her role about four months ago, replied: \u201cWhenever it\u2019s time.\u201d Trump celebrated the stock market gains following news that the US economy added 128,000 jobs last month, stronger than the 89,000 predicted by economists. (Follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog for more updates.) However, a former Republican congressman noted the president was complaining yesterday that the impeachment inquiry was allegedly dragging down US markets. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said that transcripts of the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry could be released \u201cearly next week.\u201d Asked about the timing of the release, Schiff told PBS NewsHour: \u201cYou know, I think early next week is probably the realistic time. And we still need to go through some of the transcripts and excise any potentially classified information or personal information. But they will be released very soon.\u201d Nancy Pelosi also told late-night host Stephen Colbert yesterday that public hearings in the impeachment investigation would begin \u201csoon.\u201d The impeachment resolution passed by the House outlines next steps in the inquiry as it advances to a more public stage, but Democratic leadership was evasive yesterday when asked about the specific timing of hearings or transcript releases. The accelerated timeline could help the House wrap up hearings in time for an impeachment vote potentially by the end of this month. In releasing her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d funding plan, Elizabeth Warren also noted that she would soon release a proposal on how the US would transition from its current healthcare system to a single-payer framework. Bernie Sanders, who has centered his campaign around a Medicare-for-all proposal, has said the US would shift to his system over four years, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Warren proposes a shorter or longer transitional period. Progressive activists praised the release of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s funding plan for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposal, complimenting the Massachusetts Senator for not abandoning the expansive policy. Some of the other Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, have attacked \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposals for being too dramatic of an overhaul of the US healthcare system. Of course, candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders have replied that a dramatic overhaul is exactly what the US healthcare system needs. Elizabeth Warren has released a plan to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal after some of her fellow Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, criticized her not laying out how she would fund the idea. The New York Times reports: Ms. Warren would use a mix of sources to pay for the $20.5 trillion in new spending over a decade, including by requiring employers to pay trillions of dollars to the government, replacing much of what they currently spend to provide health coverage to workers. She would create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades, change how investment gains are taxed for the top 1 percent of households and ramp up her signature wealth tax proposal to be steeper on billionaires. She also wants to cut $800 billion in military spending. The plan crucially does not include tax hikes on the middle class, a question she has repeatedly faced on the debate stage. The release of the funding plan could also help Warren to address criticisms that her proposals are unrealistic. A new Iowa poll found that the Democratic presidential primary in the early voting state is a tight race as Joe Biden has lost his lead. According to the New York Times-Siena College poll, Elizabeth Warren leads the Iowa race, attracting the support of 22 percent of the state\u2019s Democratic voters. Bernie Sanders is a close second at 19 percent, and Pete Buttigieg is just behind him at 18 percent. Biden narrowly comes in fourth at 17 percent. No other candidate hits 5 percent, but a number of contenders are hoping to make a splash at tonight\u2019s Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines, as Barack Obama did in the 2008 race. However, it\u2019s worth noting that a clear group of frontrunners has emerged just 100 days from the caucus, and any of the four top-polling candidates appears capable of winning at this point. Just a day after the House passed a resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry, a new poll has come out showing Americans are evenly divided on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. According to the Washington Post-ABC News poll, 49 percent of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 47 percent say he should not. However, that 49 percent backing impeachment overwhelmingly comes from Democrats, reflecting the nearly party-line vote in the House yesterday on the impeachment resolution. These numbers could shift once the House committees leading the inquiry advance to public hearings, as yesterday\u2019s resolution outlines, and Americans are able to hear directly from witnesses for the first time. Good morning, live blog readers! There are no depositions scheduled in the impeachment inquiry today, but investigators are already planning for three major interviews next week \u2014 assuming the witnesses show up, which is not guaranteed. The AP reports: Deepening their reach into the West Wing, impeachment investigators have summoned former national security adviser John Bolton to testify next week. But they also are seeking testimony of two other political appointees \u2014 John Eisenberg, the lead lawyer for the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a senior associate counsel to the president. ... The lawyers\u2019 role is critical because two witnesses have suggested the NSC legal counsel \u2014 when told that Trump asked a foreign leader for domestic political help \u2014 took the extraordinary step of shielding access to the transcript not because of its covert nature but rather its potential damage to the Republican president. News of Bolton\u2019s requested interview made headlines earlier this week, but the testimony of Eisenberg and Ellis could prove even more damaging for the president. As the lawyers who were notified of concerns about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president shortly after it took place, Eisenberg and Ellis could provide insight into the immediate aftermath of the conversation \u2014 and why they went to such great lengths to keep it from becoming public. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will hold a campaign rally in Mississippi at 7 p.m. C.T. Democratic presidential candidates are in Des Moines, Iowa, for the Liberty and Justice Dinner. Congress is on recess. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
