Instead, they were making meat'n'potatoes rock'n'roll that you'll still want to listen to in 10 years' time. Loyalty to Loyalty, an improvement on 2006's filler-heavy debut, is a sincere, if preachy, advertisement for integrity over image."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
