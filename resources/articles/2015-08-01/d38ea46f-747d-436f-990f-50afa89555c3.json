Smith, a former staffer to Peter Costello and until now the chair of the joint standing committee an electoral matters, pledged to give all MPs a fair go but also called for an improved level of discourse. Smith, the MP for Casey since 2001, also promised to stop attending regular party room meetings \u2013 a gesture of independence that the Labor party and some within the government had suggested as a way to draw a line under Bishop\u2019s partisanship. \u201cIt\u2019s my view that the Speaker should not only be but also should be seen to be independent of the partisan day-to-day foray,\u201d Smith told parliament after his elevation to the role. \u201cI think the decision is symbolic but it\u2019s also practical.\u201d Smith was one of four MPs to seek the position at a Liberal party room meeting in Canberra on Monday morning, prior to the resumption of parliament. The house met at 10am to elect the new Speaker as its first item of business after the winter parliamentary recess. Smith was nominated by the MP for the neighbouring seat of Deakin, Michael Sukkar, and the motion was seconded by the MP for Robertson, Lucy Wicks. Sukkar said Smith had the experience, temperament and strength necessary to instil respect and trust in the institutions of parliament. \u201cHe is a Holden man through and through,\u201d Sukkar added. There were no other nominations from the floor of the parliament, leading to the declaration that Smith was elected as Speaker. Tony Abbott, who had vowed to avoid another \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d in the Speaker selection, congratulated Smith on assuming \u201cthis high and important office\u201d. The prime minister said he was confident Smith would maintain order in the house by commanding the respect of both sides of the chamber. Abbott, who moved the motion to nominate Bishop after the 2013 election, also praised the former Speaker for being \u201ca warrior for the causes that she believed in\u201d. \u201cDespite some admitted errors of judgment, she has served this parliament, our country and her party with dedication and distinction for over 30 years,\u201d he said. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, called on the new Speaker to apply standing orders fairly to both sides of the house and to ensure straightforward questions led to straightforward answers from ministers. Shorten welcomed Smith\u2019s pledge not to attend party room meetings and said he brought to the role \u201ca proud tradition of advocating for a more accountable, more representative Australian democracy\u201d. \u201cFor all our clashes with the former Speaker, we wish her well,\u201d Shorten said. The leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, added his voice to the tributes to Bishop, but said Labor parliamentarians\u2019 comments were inconsistent with their \u201cnot-so-generous remarks not long ago\u201d. \u201cI seconded her nomination two years ago to be Speaker,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cShe has been felled in most unfair circumstances by politics today.\u201d Smith recognised Bishop for being \u201ca wonderful servant of our party\u201d. \u201cCan I thank the house for the confidence you have placed in me. There is no greater honour in the parliament than to be elected by one\u2019s peers. I\u2019m a servant of this house and all of its members.\u201d Smith said he would give a fair go to all MPs in the chamber, but in return he expected a level of discourse that reflected that. He said while parliament should be a robust place because it was the arena for the battle of ideas and ideals; \u201cit needn\u2019t be rude and it needn\u2019t be loud\u201d. \u201cThat is something I\u2019d like to see improved,\u201d he said. Smith said he had friends on both sides of the chamber and he would seek to meet periodically with the leader of the house, the manager of opposition business and independent MPs to discuss the operation of parliament. Earlier, Smith said he had been humbled by the support he received from the party room. He also thanked the three other Liberal candidates for the speakership \u2013 Russell Broadbent from Victoria, Andrew Southcott from South Australia, and Ross Vasta from Queensland \u2013 saying they were his friends. \u201cI think that friendship amongst the four of us was reflected in the civility of this contest,\u201d he said after the party room meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. The house begins in about 15 minutes so I\u2019m just going to go off and prepare for that.\u201d The final vote in the Liberal party room was between Broadbent and Smith. Smith won that contest by 51 votes to 22. Abbott left the party room meeting together with Bishop, whom he kissed on the cheek in front of the cameras. The Greens MP Adam Bandt urged Smith not to forget independent and minor party MPs, saying over 20% of Australians did not vote for either Labor or the Coalition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
