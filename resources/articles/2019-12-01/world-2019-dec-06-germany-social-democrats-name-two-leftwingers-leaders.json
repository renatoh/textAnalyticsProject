Saskia Esken, a digital policy expert, and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former state finance minister, were confirmed as the first SPD leadership pairing in the party\u2019s 156-year history in a verification vote on Friday. The conference, entitled New Era, also resurrected the party\u2019s traditional symbol of a red rose. The pair used their maiden speeches to pledge an intense dialogue with the Christian Democrats and their sister Christian Social Union party over the future of the coalition. They have called for improvements on welfare and environmental policies, as well as an end to the government\u2019s commitment to stick to a balanced budget \u2013 the \u201cblack zero\u201d. But they strikingly rowed back from demanding a renegotiation of the coalition agreement with Merkel\u2019s conservatives, or the withdrawal of the SPD from the government, despite having campaigned forcefully on that issue. \u201cIt is time for an about-turn,\u201d said Esken, calling for an end to the neoliberal labour policies introduced by the former leader Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the unpopularity of which many members cite as the reason for a dramatic erosion in the party\u2019s support in recent years. Walter-Borjans, who has been likened to Robin Hood for his battle against tax evasion, said it was time to loosen the German attachment to balancing the budget in order to invest in Germany\u2019s ailing infrastructure, from schools and universities to its digital future, as well as clawing back control from financial markets. \u201cIt\u2019s not democracy that should bow to the markets, rather the markets that should bow to democracy,\u201d he said to warm applause. Olaf Scholz, the finance minister, who lost out to Esken and Walter-Borjans in the leadership race, having been widely expected to win it along with his partner, Klara Geywitz, congratulated the couple, and said the party had no choice but to stick together if it hoped to claw back some of the many millions of voters the SPD had lost, mainly to the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland over the past few years. \u201cA strong SPD is important because a society without us would be very different,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will only manage this if we stick together \u2026 and if we ensure we have a plan how to make it work.\u201d He said the party needed to recognise its achievements in government, including the introduction of a minimum wage and basic pension, which is in the process of passing through parliament. The duo, nicknamed \u201cEskabo\u201d by their supporters, have set themselves the ambitious task of increasing the SPD\u2019s voter support twofold, from the current record low of 15%, within the next year. Their threat to pull the SPD out of the government prematurely \u2013 new elections are not due until 2021 \u2013 caused Berlin\u2019s political class to hold its breath over the past week, with political observers at home and abroad braced for an earlier than anticipated departure of Merkel, who has said she will not stand again. Her conservative alliance has vehemently opposed the SPD\u2019s idea of renegotiating the coalition agreement, which took six months to reach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
