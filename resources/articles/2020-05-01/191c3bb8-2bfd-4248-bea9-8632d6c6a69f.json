Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, claims Beijing gave \u201cfalse information\u201d to the World Health Organization over Covid-19. Democratic VP contender Demings slams Trump \u2018gall\u2019 over Biden black voters gaffe. Democratic representative from Florida castigated president for having the \u201cgall and nerve\u201d to use a gaffe by Biden as a weapon on the campaign trail. China raises US trade tensions with warning of \u2018new cold war\u2019. Foreign minister accuses Washington of damaging relationship with Beijing Trump: Sessions was not \u2018mentally qualified\u2019 to be attorney general. Sessions continues to doggedly protest that only he can properly implement the president\u2019s agenda. Virginia governor Ralph Northam says masks save lives \u2013 then doesn\u2019t wear one. Democrat fails to heed own device, posing without a mask during a visit to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. You can continue to follow the latest on Covid-19 in our global liveblog: The Associated Press has reported on concerns that insufficient or faulty data is hampering the US\u2019s efforts to contain Covid-19. Here\u2019s the report: Elected officials, businesses and others are depending on coronavirus testing and infection-rate data as states reopen so that they will know if a second wave of contagion is coming and whether another round of stay-at-home orders or closings might be needed. But states are reporting those figures in different ways, and that can lead to frustration and confusion about what the numbers mean. In some places, there have been data gaps that leave local leaders wondering whether they should loosen or tighten restrictions. In others, officials are accused of spinning the numbers to make their states look better and justify reopening. In a continuing theme for the outbreak in the United States, a lack of federal leadership persists. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been lumping together tests that measure different things. Such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are infected \u201cuninterpretable,\u201d creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, \u201cIt is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they\u2019re presenting information that\u2019s accurate. And if they can\u2019t get it, then don\u2019t show the data at all,\u201d Jha said. \u201cFaulty data is much, much worse than no data.\u201d The press secretary for Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, has admitted the governor should have worn a facemask during a public appearance this weekend. Ralph Northam, who is also a qualified physician, said last week that \u201cwearing a mask could literally save someone else\u2019s life\u201d. However, during a visit to Virginia Beach Oceanfront on Saturday he was seen without a mask. \u201cHe was outside yesterday and not expecting to be within six feet of anyone,\u201d Northam\u2019s press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change we are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it\u2019s important to be prepared.\u201d Todd Gilbert, a Virginia Republican, tweeted a photo of Northam without a mask with the message \u201cPhysician, heal thyself\u201d. Deaths from Covid-19 in Virginia were at 1,135 as of Sunday. Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace is not popular on Twitter with supporters of the president after he criticised White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Fox News Sunday. Last week, McEnany questioned the religious beliefs of reporters. McEnany made the comments after Trump said places of worship should count as essential services during the pandemic. She said she found it \u201cinteresting to be in a room that desperately wants to seem to see these churches and houses of worship stay closed.\u201d On Sunday, Wallace said that \u201c[former ABC White House correspondent] Sam Donaldson and me in the Reagan White House, we were pretty tough on the White House press secretaries and we never had our religious beliefs questioned or were lectured on what we should ask.\u201d Wallace\u2019s comments are sure to irk Trump, who has complained of Wallace\u2019s coverage of his administration. In an interview with Full Measure, Donald Trump has once again blamed the Covid-19 pandemic on China and praised his own handling of the crisis. \u201cIt came out of China, whether we like it or not, it came out of China. It could have been stopped. It came all over the world, but it didn\u2019t really go to China,\u201d said the president. \u201cThey stopped their planes going into China, but they didn\u2019t stop their planes and their traffic going into the rest of the world, including the United States and Europe, and Europe is decimated. And you look at what happened all over the world, 186 countries. So now it\u2019s a very terrible thing and they could have stopped it if they wanted to, they could have stopped it. Either it was incompetent or they didn\u2019t want to, both are not very acceptable, by the way.\u201d Trump was then asked how he felt when he first heard the virus could kill millions of people. As has been his habit, he praised his own response to the pandemic rather than express any sympathy towards those who have died or lost relatives. \u201cSo I was hearing millions of people, and it would have been millions of people if we didn\u2019t shut down,\u201d said Trump. \u201c... I did a ban and nobody thought I should do it. I mean, literally I don\u2019t think anybody thought I should do it. I made that decision by myself and it turned out to be a great decision. Hundreds of thousands of lives are saved.\u201d The president also confirmed he had completed a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19, despite scientists cautioning against taking the drug to treat the virus. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard tremendous reports about it,\u201d said Trump. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019ve heard tremendous reports. Many people think it saved their lives.\u201d My colleague Richard Luscombe has news on Joe Biden\u2019s holiday weekend activities... The latest installment of Sincerely, Joe, the digital letter series launched earlier this month by the Democratic presumptive presidential candidate Joe Biden to showcase his correspondence with the American people during the coronavirus pandemic, includes the revelation that his favorite flavor of ice cream is, wait for it, chocolate chip. The detail comes in the former vice-president\u2019s reply to a young letter writer called Jack Cooney, who sent a colorful drawing of himself with Biden and a request to know: \u201cWhat was your favorite part of working with President Obama?\u201d alongside the ice cream question. \u201cKids like you, our future leaders, give me hope,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cYour curiosity and your empathy underscore the idea that as Americans, we have the power to uplift one another and improve our communities for future generations. \u201cIt is no coincidence; this was also my favorite part about working with President Obama. His hope is eternal, his friendship is true, and he has a heart as big as they come. Our friends inspire, encourage, and support us, especially on our toughest days. Often, it\u2019s as simple as being there for one another.\u201d As for the ice cream, Biden urges Jack to: \u201ccontinue to devote yourself to your studies, work hard every day, develop a genuine, life-long love of learning, and treat yourself to a little chocolate chip ice cream, my favorite flavor, every once in a while.\u201d Aides have dismissed concerns that Biden\u2019s campaign has suffered through his self-isolation at his Delaware home. He retains a 5.5% lead over Donald Trump in the Real Clear Politics national poll average for November\u2019s election. New York is making its first steps towards reopening, a fact demonstrated when Governor Andrew Cuomo gave his daily press briefing from Long Island\u2019s Jones Beach on Sunday. Cuomo said professional sports teams in New York will now be allowed to reopen their training camps and the governor said it was a sign of a \u201creturn to normalcy.\u201d While New York City has been noticeably busier in the last week, the city\u2019s beaches are still closed and many residents are expected to head to Long Island over the holiday weekend, where restrictions are less severe and beaches are open. Cuomo said that New Yorkers must still be vigilant, despite the easing however. The state recorded 109 deaths from Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, a slight rise from the previous day. \u201cWhat do we really think, this is the last time we are going to have a public health emergency?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we are better for what we have gone through.\u201d Temperatures in much of New York were cool on Sunday, but many people still wanted to be outside. \u201cPeople still make the best out of it. It doesn\u2019t matter. I guess during this pandemic they\u2019ve been practicing staying home, staying safe, so now they see an opportunity and they just want to get out,\u201d one New Yorker, Jessica M Lopez, told the Associated Press. Much of the focus on Covid-19 layoffs has understandably been on workers in the private sector. But New Jersey governor Phil Murphy today warned that state and federal workers could be at risk too. In an appearance on CNN, the Democratic governor said that some of the state\u2019s teachers, police and health workers could be laid off if New Jersey does not receive more federal assistance. \u201cWe announced a budget on Friday for the next four months and we had to cut or defer over $5bn of expenditures,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd this includes potentially laying off educators, firefighters, police, EMS, health care workers. This is not abstract. This is real. It\u2019s not a blue state issue. It\u2019s an American issue.\u201d New Jersey has the second-most deaths of any US state from Covid-19. Murphy said 52 deaths from the virus had been reported in the last 24 hours, bring the state\u2019s death toll to 11,133. UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s top adviser, Dominic Cummings, was revealed by the Guardian to have made a 264-mile trip to his parents\u2019 home while the country was in lockdown. Many expected Cummings to resign - or be fired - for contravening the lockdown. Instead, today Johnson has backed his adviser saying he was right to take the trip, which Cummings said was in the interest of his son\u2019s health after Cummings\u2019 wife fell ill. An editorial in the Guardian echoes the feeling of many in the UK: Ever get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister\u2019s friends. The stated message was: \u201cStay at home\u201d. The unstated: \u201cDo as we say, and not as we do\u201d. The breach of rules by Mr Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage. Many in the UK\u2019s civil service appear to be angry with Johnson and Cummings too. A since deleted tweet from the civil service\u2019s official account went straight to the point. \u201cArrogant and offensive,\u201d read the tweet from the @UKCivilService Twitter account, which has just over 250,000 followers. \u201cCan you imagine having to work with these truth twisters?\u201d There fears that the holiday weekend may lead to people heading to public spaces and ignoring social distancing. That certainly appears to be the case in Missouri, where video emerged of a pool party at the Lake of the Ozarks packed with people who are separated by six inches rather than the recommended six feet. A pool party may be the source of an outbreak in another state, Arkansas. The state\u2019s governor, Asa Hutchinson, said this weekend that Arkansas faces a \u201csecond peak\u201d of cases and some of those could be linked back to a high school party. \u201cA high school swim party that I\u2019m sure everybody thought was harmless,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re swimming, they\u2019re just having activity, and positive cases resulted from that.\u201d Arkansas has recently lifted some Covid-19 related restrictions but Hutchinson, a Republican, said he did not necessarily believes a rise in cases was due to the easing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think about next fall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be cloistered in our homes. That\u2019s contrary to the American spirit.\u201d After playing golf yesterday, Donald Trump was back on the fairways at his course in Virginia today. According to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, this is the president\u2019s 266th trip to one of his golf clubs since he took office. Photos from Saturday, showed the president failing to observe social distancing and shaking hands during his round as the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the US approaches 100,000. Trump\u2019s own public health experts said that golf is an acceptable activity but that players should still be cautious when playing. \u201cWe\u2019re asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, to play golf, to hike, as Dr [Anthony] Fauci said, to play tennis with marked balls and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with and to even consider sharing social distance space,\u201d said coronavirus taskforce member Dr Deborah Birx on Friday. Birx also said golfers should not touch flags on greens and added: \u201cremember that that is your space, and that\u2019s a space that you need to protect and ensure that you social distance for others.\u201d Anyone playing with Trump today may want to keep an eye on the president\u2019s scorecard too. Because, as Rick Reilly, has detailed the president does not always play by golf\u2019s rules: Donald Trump has tweeted that Covid-19 \u201ccases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!\u201d. While cases and deaths from the virus are declining across as the US as a whole, individual states have reported upticks. Deaths in New York were up over the last 24 hours, while rises have been reported in Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas and Washington DC. Public health experts are also urging Americans to remain at home, and there is a fear that the reopening of many states risks a second wave of deaths from Covid-19. Mike DeWine, Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, decried the politicization of wearing masks in public to help contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is not about politics, this is not about whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative, left or right, Republican, Democrat,\u201d DeWine said in an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. \u201cWe wear the mask, and it\u2019s been very clear what the studies have shown, you wear the mask not to protect yourself so much as to protect others. And this is one time when we truly are all in this together. What we do directly impacts others.\u201d DeWine\u2019s remarks were in response to North Dakota governor Doug Burgum\u2019s emotional address on Friday decrying the \u201csenseless dividing line\u201d between US citizens over whether masks should be worn in public. With many states like Ohio beginning to relax stay-at-home restrictions, DeWine stressed the importance of doing it carefully. \u201cOur order does say that every employee in every business unless there is some reason that they can\u2019t wear that mask, every employee\u2019s wearing a mask today,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a fundamental change in Ohio. As we go out, you know, a lot of stores you\u2019ll see 90% of the people who do, the customers are wearing masks. But we want to continue to up that throughout the state because it is really what we need as we open up the economy. \u201cLook, Chuck, this is a risk. But it\u2019s also a risk if we don\u2019t open up the economy, all the downsides of not opening the economy. We can do both these things.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar internet thing \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I can use the word meme here or not, because Richard Dawkins lost me on it years ago and I never caught up \u2013 to express comic bewilderment at the things 2020 has decided to throw at us: a pandemic, floods, murder hornets, celebrities singing Imagine in lockdown. We\u2019ve already had warnings about starving, cannibalistic rats, so perhaps new federal warnings about aggressive rats are actually only worth a side note. But, y\u2019know, Winston Smith, Orwell, Room 101, worst fears, etc. So: According to new advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201csome jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.\u201d As the Washington Post puts it, this is bad because \u201crats can transmit food-borne illnesses such as salmonella, and their urine can also worsen allergies and asthma, especially in children\u201d. So that\u2019s nice. Richard Luscombe writes\u2026 A (little) more detail on the revelations from Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, on Fox News Sunday that Donald Trump does indeed wear a mask when he\u2019s not socially distancing. It turns out to be more of an assumption on her part, in place of any hard and fast evidence. \u201cI\u2019m not with him every day and every moment so I don\u2019t know if he can maintain social distance. I\u2019ve asked everybody independently to really make sure you wear a mask if you can\u2019t maintain the six feet,\u201d Birx said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that in a majority of cases he\u2019s able to maintain that six feet distance.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Wallace if she felt Trump should be setting an example to the country by wearing one in public, Birx said: \u201cThe president did wear a mask while he was less than six feet\u2026 where that was important, while he was travelling last week.\u201d Birx was presumably referring to his visit to a Ford plant in Michigan during which he told reporters he had worn one \u201cbackstage\u201d but removed it for his public appearance because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d More generally, Birx said: \u201cThere\u2019s clear scientific evidence to show that a mask does prevent droplets from reaching others. Out of respect for each other, as Americans that care for each other, we need to be wearing masks in public when we cannot socially distance.\u201d She said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d at images of people enjoying the Memorial Day weekend on beaches and parks, in close proximity and without masks. \u201cWe know being outside does help, we know the sun does help in killing the virus, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that people need to be responsible and maintain that distance,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping to convey this very clear message to the American people. Across the country there is a virus out there.\u201d Birx faced similar questions from Martha Raddatz on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, who questioned whether her comments on Friday that people should get outside for Memorial Day was the right call. \u201cWe have to communicate through different venues, making sure that our generation sees and our Millennials can help us get that message out there, of how to be together socially yet distant,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans are amazingly innovative. And I think we really just need to have better continuous communication on how important that is.\u201d One big question from Raddatz as numbers continue to spike in some areas\u2026 will the nation need a prolonged, or second lockdown? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell and I really am data-driven, so I\u2019m collecting data right now about whether governors and whether states and whether communities are able to open safely,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of this proactive testing needs to be in place and needs to continue to be in place because that will determine safely remaining open in the fall.\u201d Val Demings, a Democratic representative from Florida who is among contenders to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in the presidential election, has castigated Donald Trump for having the \u201cgall and nerve\u201d to use a gaffe by Biden as a weapon on the campaign trail. Biden apologised after saying if African Americans \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d, a remark which prompted fierce attacks from supporters of the president and criticism from Biden\u2019s own backers. \u201cThe vice-president shouldn\u2019t have said it, he apologised for it,\u201d Demings told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cBut I really think the gall and the nerve of President Trump to try to use this in his campaign, he who has since day one done everything in his power, supported by his enablers, to divide this country, particularly along racial lines \u2026 \u201cLook, let\u2019s talk about race because we definitely need to, we see it in housing, we see it in voting rights, we see it in healthcare, we see it in education. Mr President, let\u2019s do have a serious conversation about race in America and how about working for all people that you are supposed to represent, not just the privileged few.\u201d It was the kind of fiery defence one would expect from someone talked about as a possible running mate. Biden has committed to choosing a woman and many \u2013 including the interviewer who elicited the gaffe on Friday, radio host Charlamagne tha God \u2013 think it should be an African American woman. California senator Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams \u2013 a target of retweets in dubious taste from Trump on Saturday night \u2013 are generally thought to be the most likely picks. But Demings, a former Orlando police chief, delivered a decent mini-audition for a traditional running mate role: going on the offensive. Asked about expressions of outrage from the Republican South Carolina senator Tim Scott and former Utah representative Mia Love, Demings said: \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that the president searched high and low to find [an] African American member of the Senate and a former member of Congress to speak out on this issue. It\u2019d be nice to hear other Republicans, male or female, speak out.\u201d CNN host Dana Bash asked directly if Demings wants to be vice-president. She did not answer directly, but made it clear she would serve if asked. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has also appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, to accuse China of a \u201ccover-up that they did of the virus [that] is going to go down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d. Most scientists say the pathogen that has infected 5.3m and killed more than 342,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, was passed from bats to humans via an intermediary species likely sold at a wet market in Wuhan late last year. But Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior US figures have repeatedly said they suspect the coronavirus was somehow released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Trump administration is seeking a scapegoat for a US death toll near 100,000, criticism of the president\u2019s handling of the outbreak and a cratering economy. Vice-President Mike Pence kept up the charge on Saturday, telling Breitbart News: \u201cChina let the world down and the World Health Organization was their willing partner in withholding from the United States and the wider world vital information about the coronavirus that would have made it possible to stand up a national response sooner. \u201c... Make no mistake about it that China will be held accountable for what the world has gone through because of their lack of transparency.\u201d On Sunday, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe want good relations with China and with the Chinese people, but unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing just action after action by the Chinese Communist Party that makes it difficult \u2026 we\u2019re dealing in a new world now with corona. \u201cThey unleashed a virus on the world that\u2019s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we\u2019re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus. So we\u2019re in a, we\u2019re in a very different world. \u201cThe cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history along with Chernobyl. We\u2019ll see an HBO special about 10 or 15 years from now, and so we\u2019re in a different place with China as we speak today.\u201d The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported comments from the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology about US claims the lab is to blame for the virus. Such claims are a \u201cpure fabrication\u201d, Wang Yanyi was quoted by state media as saying, adding that the institute did not have \u201cany knowledge before that nor had we ever met, researched or kept the virus. We didn\u2019t even know about the existence of the virus, so how could it be leaked from our lab when we didn\u2019t have it?\u201d The AP also said the coronavirus toll continues to ebb in Asia and other parts of the world, with China on Sunday reporting three new cases and just 79 people remaining in treatment for Covid-19. Here\u2019s an op ed about such comparisons, from a more sober standpoint: The United States will on Sunday impose a lockdown on travelers from Brazil, according to Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Covid-19 deaths have soared in Brazil as the country\u2019s foul-mouthed president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to deflect from the crisis. It seems the Trump administration has heard enough. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a decision today with respect to Brazil, just like we did with the UK and Europe and China, and we hope it will be temporary,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the people of the southern hemisphere,\u201d O\u2019Brien continued, \u201cthe people of Brazil, they\u2019ve had a rough go of it. But because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people. \u201cAs of now I\u2019d say Brazil, and we\u2019ll take a look at the other countries on a country by country basis.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not divulge details of any such lockdown. But the conversation did allow him to pick up the White House narrative of painting China as the bogeyman of the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThey allowed those folks to travel from China to Europe, and to seed the disease in Europe and have it come through a backdoor into the United States,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIn perfect hindsight, when we realized the Europeans hadn\u2019t cut off travel, sure it would have been better to cut off earlier.\u201d O\u2019Brien claimed \u201cliterally hundreds of thousands or millions of lives were saved\u201d by Trump\u2019s travel bans, and that the president\u2019s move was \u201ca profile in courage\u201d. The Washington Post reported on Saturday on how Trump\u2019s restriction on flights from Europe backfired badly. O\u2019Brien also said he expected an in-person G7 gathering of world leaders to take place in Washington in late June. \u201cWe\u2019re getting very close to the peak [of the pandemic] if we\u2019re not already, in Washington and if the situation permits it, and we think it will, we\u2019d love to have the G7 in person,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure everybody\u2019s tested, we\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s a safe environment. The leaders would love to get out of their offices and meet in person to plan the post-Covid world.\u201d Two other notable footnotes: the US presidential election will take place as planned on 3 November, \u201cno question about it\u201d O\u2019Brien says, despite speculation fuelled by comments from Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner that the administration might be looking at a postponement. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens with the virus, but we want to make sure that we have a free and fair election. That election\u2019s going to take place on election day, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, declaring that stockpiles of PPE, especially masks, were being built for election workers. O\u2019Brien also insisted there was no security risk posed by Trump, the nation\u2019s commander in chief, continuing to take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that the Food and Drug Administration says could have life-threatening side effects. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing the right regimen for President Trump \u2026 he\u2019s under great medical care,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing the right thing that he and his physician believe is good for the president. The guy\u2019s got more energy than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he added, claiming improbably that the golf-loving president was working \u201c16, 18 hours a day.\u201d Florida senator, and former governor, Rick Scott is up on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, struggling to explain why he thinks Floridians should wear masks and socially distance while the state reopens and beaches fill over Memorial Day weekend, but doesn\u2019t think there should be official mandates to do so. \u201cI trust the American public to make good decisions,\u201d Scott says. But he thinks \u201cif you\u2019re close to somebody you oughta wear a mask. We have to social distance safely \u2026 we have to do it.\u201d Asked about comments to Fox News earlier this week which were much more skeptical and, well, Trumpy, Scott insists people should not be told what to do by the president, governors, senators and other figures in authority. But should heed advice, such as that he, a senator, is giving now. Scott defends Trump\u2019s attempt to order states to open houses of worship on the same lines: people will do it safely but the government shouldn\u2019t order them to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what the president or a governor says,\u201d says the former governor and current senator. In a sense, of course, it doesn\u2019t matter what Trump says on the churches issue, because he doesn\u2019t have the constitutional power to order governors to open churches. Speaking of America\u2019s beaches, here\u2019s Ankita Rao on the subject: White House public health adviser Dr Deborah Birx is appearing on Fox News Sunday and according to Fox News Sunday, she says: \u201cPresident Trump does wear a mask when he is unable to social distance from others.\u201d Trump\u2019s reluctance to wear a mask in public or apparently in private has become a running theme of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly since cases were confirmed in the White House, close to the president himself. This week, at a Ford plant in Michigan, Trump was pictured wearing one. Not without connection to Trump\u2019s stance, the wearing of masks in public, or not, has become a new front line in America\u2019s culture war. Federal guidelines recommend it, some states demand it, and some do not. Some rightwing protesters have decried the wearing of masks. On Saturday, video spread showing North Dakota governor Doug Burgum moved to tears while pleading for people not to \u201cmask shame\u201d those who choose to cover their noses and mouths in public. North Dakota does not mandate the wearing of masks. Also from Fox News Sunday about its interview with Birx (which airs at 10am ET in New York): \u201cDr Deborah Birx says on Fox News Sunday she is still concerned with people going outside and not social distancing.\u201d Here\u2019s a picture of Donald Trump shaking hands with a golfing partner in Virginia on Saturday: Talk shows up. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett tells CNN\u2019s State of the Union he expects unemployment to go \u201cnorth of 20%\u201d before any correction, which means figures will be higher in June. Nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under the pandemic, after all. Is it possible unemployment will still be in double digits in November when the country goes to the polls, Hassett is asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation the election won\u2019t be delayed, by the way. Trump hopes an election held in an economic hole does not happen, to put it mildly, as he gears up for his election campaign against Joe Biden. Unemployment will move back slowly, Hassett says, adding: \u201cIf there were a vaccine in July I would be way more optimistic about it.\u201d There won\u2019t be. Hassett is also pressed on the prospects for the stimulus bill passed by the House but stalled in front of the Senate and the White House. He hedges but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no significant movement. Checking in on the catchweight bout of the century \u2013 or, well, today \u2013 between Donald Trump and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, better known as Jeff Sessions, the attorney general Trump tormented and fired over his recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation who is now running for his old Senate seat in Alabama while Trump torments him some more. Sessions, on Saturday: \u201cMr President. Alabama can and does trust me, as do conservatives across the country. Perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten. They trusted me when I stepped out and put that trust on the line for you. You and I fight for the same agenda. Tommy Tuberville [his Senate opponent, ahead in the polls, endorsed by Trump] is so weak he won\u2019t debate me and too weak for Alabama. \u201cAlabama will vote for you this fall, but Alabama will not take orders from Washington on who to send to the Senate.\u201d Trump, in reply: \u201cJeff, you had your chance and you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, and ruined many lives. The dirty cops, and others, got caught by better and stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big price. \u201cYou should drop out of the race and pray that super liberal Doug Jones, a weak and pathetic puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi &amp; Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, gets beaten badly. He voted for impeachment based on \u201cZERO\u201d. Disgraced Alabama. Coach Tuberville will be a GREAT Senator!\u201d So there\u2019s that: Donald Trump has no public events scheduled today. It\u2019s the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the weather forecast for Washington DC is, if not spectacular, not wet. One would think it\u2019s a toss-up whether the president stays in to rage tweet the morning shows \u2013 Dr Deborah Birx is up on a couple and seems sure to be asked about the president\u2019s choice of activity on Saturday as the coronavirus death toll neared 100,000 \u2013 or heads back to Trump National in Sterling, Virginia. While we wait \u2013 on the edges of our seats, I\u2019m sure \u2013 to find out, here\u2019s some further reading from our columnist Robert Reich, once labor secretary under Bill Clinton, on the great question of whether it\u2019s safe for states to reopen their economies (or indeed their churches, as Trump demanded they do today): \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, and of course the politics around it. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 1,613,302 confirmed cases in the US and 96,657 deaths. Around 1,000 of those deaths, and a few details about the person behind each one, are featured on a New York Times front page which is making headlines of its own this morning. Also making headlines, Donald Trump\u2019s decision to spend Saturday playing golf at his course in Virginia. On Saturday night, the conservative never-Trumper, Lincoln Project member and husband of a senior Trump aide George Conway spliced the two images together on Twitter. It was a powerful juxtaposition. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released an ad on the subject. Public health experts including the White House\u2019s own Dr Deborah Birx say golf is OK, with social distancing and other measures observed \u2013 Trump, not wearing a mask, was filmed shaking hands with a playing partner \u2013 as the country looks to open up its battered economy. So, like so much in politics, this is all about the optics. It\u2019s also all about the hypocrisy, of course, as all politics is. In this case, Trump used to batter Barack Obama for playing too much golf. In office, Trump has played more than 200 times \u2013 more than Obama did in his first term. Also, as the president played during a public health crisis it turned out, of course it did, that There Was A Tweet For That: Trump did turn away from golf in the evening, though only to deliver a characteristic tweet storm from the confines of the White House. Among his targets for caustic comments and retweets in highly questionable taste: Nancy Pelosi, Stacey Abrams, Jeff Sessions and of course Biden. Trump also once again insinuated, disgracefully, that former Republican congressman and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough might be guilty of murder. About the veracity or otherwise of that vicious claim, the Washington Post fact checker awards it its top rating of four Pinnochios and says: \u201cWe wish we had more to give.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
