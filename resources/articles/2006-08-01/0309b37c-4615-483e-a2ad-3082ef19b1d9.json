Ex-team-mates say yes (probably)", "bodyText": "Paul Parker said of his former Manchester United team-mate: \"The one thing Roy has to get into his head straight away is that he will be working with lesser players. \"People will have nowhere near the quality he had as a player or his team-mates had. He will have to restrain himself because Sunderland's players won't be able to do what David Beckham, Eric Cantona or Ruud Van Nistelrooy were capable of. \"Roy was loud and brash; a young man who just enjoyed himself for the moment and didn't worry about the next 24 hours. When he first came to United, I never thought he would become a manager but I thought the same about Mark Hughes, and look what he's done. \"Roy has changed in recent years: he has mellowed. He's a big thinker now. You can tell he is serious by trying to bring in Brian Kidd. He was the best coach I worked under and would make a big difference at Sunderland. \"He would be the best coach in the division by a mile, and would probably still be the best in the Premiership.\" Dean Kiely, the Portsmouth goalkeeper who knows Keane from the Irish squads, said: \"Roy was very vocal in the dressing room and on the pitch, and he is a perfect leader. \"He commands respect and has an aura about him. Players will respond to passionate people. \"I always react better to a manager who is straightforward and honest with me, someone who would give you a pat on the back when you'd done well, but a kick up the backside when you needed it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
