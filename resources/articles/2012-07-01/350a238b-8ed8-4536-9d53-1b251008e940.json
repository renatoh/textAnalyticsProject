With scandal, more so. And the wise business sort is always looking for an opportunity. This may explain the offer emailed to our much criticised, much maligned MPs at Westminster the other day. \"Personal protection at its best! The best bulletproof vest you can get. Israeli made. Battle proven. Light. Concealed. Tested. Introducing the Robo Level 3A Concealed vest. Less than $360!\" They know a ready market when they see one at Bulletproofvestshop.com. \u2022 Our friends in the British National party have been quiet of late \u2013 the result, some would say, of the outright drubbing they received in May's local elections. Nature's way of telling them to go away and reflect. And the matters requiring reflection mount daily, the latest of which must be the warning handed down by a judge to national organiser Adam Walker that he should prepare himself for the possibility of spending some of what's left of this year in jail. Walker is normally a stickler for law and order. But we all have days when it is impossible to fight the urge to chase down schoolchildren with a knife and to slash the tyres on their bikes, having argued with them about things they have been getting up to on a bouncy castle. Children can try the patience of a saint. Mr Walker, who is said to have brandished his knife in one child's face, clearly needed all of his experience as a former teacher in Tyne and Wear to cope with a difficult situation. The fact that he once denounced immigrants in Britain as \"savage animals\" is neither here nor there. \u2022 All change at the BBC with the ascent of George Entwistle to the top job. Not the exciting outside choice that was mooted. But in the upper echelons of the corporation, they're happy. Some review of the roles is inevitable and already we note that, according to the BBC's internal email address book, the chair of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, works at urban music station Radio 1Xtra. He's a sidekick to \"Big Dawg\" Tim Westwood, we think. \u2022 And never let it be said, meanwhile, that the government is shying away from those issues that truly confront us as a nation. This from Eric Pickles, the communities secretary: \"The Department is currently assessing responses to a discussion paper on relaxing the planning regime on flag flying and allowing people to fly more flags without having to seek and pay for planning consent from their local authority.\" On Monday, he hoisted the flag of the Cayman Islands. More to come. Exciting, isn't it? \u2022 Finally, thought for the day, and our subject is betrayal. One invests a deal of trust in the hope that it will be recognised, perhaps reciprocated. But those hopes are so easily dashed. And that's how we feel today. For four years, this column has provided a critical commentary on the doings of London mayor Boris Johnson \u2013 his hiring of a deputy mayor who was later convicted for fiddling expenses, his hiring of a deputy mayor who fiddled his CV, his embrace of Bob Diamond, that sort of thing. And it has all been good stuff, but it has been difficult to write because we were actually deployed here by Johnson to watch his back with the lefty class and provide undercover intelligence. And everything was going quite well until Wednesday, when Johnson, without warning and for reasons only he will understand, decided to expose the entire operation. \"I have to say there are some parts of the media where it is not very easy for us to gain a fair hearing,\" he told the London Assembly, during a question time discussion about his shady, undisclosed meetings with News International. \"I have some strong supporters at the Guardian. Polly Toynbee and Hugh Muir; they back me but not everyone in the Guardian backs City Hall in the way one might expect.\" His \"outing\" of Polly was pure mischief, for she is as she seems, and she truly believes the mayor is a menace, a \"serial liar\" and a \"sociopath\". But we've been quietly loyal to Bozza all these years; living this double life and consorting with the enemy. It does seem mean of him to cut us adrift.
