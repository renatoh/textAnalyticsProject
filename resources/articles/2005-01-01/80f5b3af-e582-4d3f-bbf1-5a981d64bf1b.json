The tables show that the specialist Jewish housing association Agudas Israel is the most cost-effective landlord in England. At the other end of the scale the Enabling Partnership, a housing association that supports disabled people in Hampshire, is judged to be the most costly. The Housing Corporation, which published the figures on 500 landlords, said they provided \"insights into the relative efficiency of housing associations\". But at the same time the corporation tried to claim that they were not league tables. Last summer, the corporation was roundly criticised when it published an earlier version of the exercise as a league table. Housing associations, particularly those that appeared towards the bottom of the table, claimed the figures were too crude. They also said the data only measured costs and not efficiency. In response the corporation has refined the data, and relabelled the exercise the \"operating cost indices\" rather than the \"efficiency index\". Two versions of the tables have also been published - one that includes the cost of repairs and another that does not. Peter Dixon, the corporation's chairman said: \"These indices provide a more sophisticated analysis than has previously been possible.\" He explained: \"We must all be wary of simplistic interpretation. We have presented the data in various ways, but we do not believe it is helpful to see these as league tables - not least because we are all ultimately interested in quality and value for money, not simply low costs.\" But he added: \"We will want to understand how associations are seeking to deliver improved efficiency and effectiveness.\" The figures come at a time of growing attention on value for money in public services, following the review for the government by Sir Peter Gershon into public sector efficiency. Also, in the housing sector, a Treasury study into supply by the economist Kate Barker said that more homes could be built if housing associations were more efficient. Simon Knighton, the commercial director of the Enabling Partnership housing association - now known as Enham - said: \"We are concerned about coming bottom of the list, but it distorts the true picture. We would like to work with the Housing Corporation to make the indices more representative.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
