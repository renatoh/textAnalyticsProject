I was nominated as course rep and learned good social and teamworking skills through contact with other reps. Early in the semester, I attended a networking event for all students on the course. The event was useful in bringing together people who had not met during enrolment and also brought full-time students into contact with professionals who were studying part-time. It was there I met Andrea Stevenson, a consultant at NTP Meridian. We hit it off, and she suggested I would do well in her organisation. I expressed an interest in gaining experience there and after a couple more meetings on campus she recommended me to her managing director. Shortly afterwards, I was given a placement, working two days a week. I was able to attend client workshops and give presentations; I also learned how to develop corporate relationships. I was on a steep learning curve but when I graduated they decided to hire me, in part because they were familiar with my standards and work ethos. For me, actively networking while at university definitely paid off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
