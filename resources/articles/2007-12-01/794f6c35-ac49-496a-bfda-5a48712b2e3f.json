However, she admits in this week's Radio Times that most people still just want to talk about her leg-crossing, knife-swinging incarnation as Alex in Fatal Attraction. \"They often say, 'You scared the shit outta me,'\" she reports, then adds, weirdly: \"Sometimes they say, 'You saved my marriage.'\" She is much engaged with the US presidential campaign. \"The issues are just so important, and I think I'm revving up to jump in again for Hillary Clinton.\" Republican bunnies, you have been warned. The new director of the UK branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Andrew Barnett, has an extremely British CV, including stints at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Sports Council, but was born in New South Wales, and feels he should drop in on one particularly quirky southern hemisphere project. An arts residency on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is funded from the British section of the Lisbon-based charity, which gives millions every year in social affairs, educational and cultural grants. Last year the Gulbenkian sent the artist Dorothy Cross and the actor Fiona Shaw to meet the giant turtles; Shaw came home convinced that human survival is inextricably linked to preserving the animal world. Next year's artists will be announced soon and Barnett feels he ought to check personally how they get on. \"It's on my Christmas wish list,\" he said. Eddie the Eagle, who soared to an immortal last in the ski jump at the Calgary winter Olympics in 1988, has already put his daughter Honey May on to skis on the artificial slope at Gloucester. Since Honey May is only nine months old, she may not be quite ready for Vancouver in 2010, but Sochi in 2014 must be real possibility. Many of the usual art world suspects are on the list, including Julian Opie, Yinka Shonibare, Gavin Turk, Banksy and Norman Rosenthal - and Rosenthal, the peppery exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, may be particularly outraged to find himself there, almost as cross as the perennially revolting Charles Thompson of the Stuckists. Top spot goes to contemporary art critic JJ Charlesworth. The list, compiled by the young 'uns at the art magazine Rebel, is of the \"Top 50 Least Important Art World Figures &amp; Institutions: they don't move, they don't shake, they're not hurting anybody\". maev.kennedy@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
