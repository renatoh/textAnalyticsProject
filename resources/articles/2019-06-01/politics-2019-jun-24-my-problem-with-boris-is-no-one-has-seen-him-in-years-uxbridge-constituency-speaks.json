Enjoying a lunchtime break from her job in a recruitment agency, Cherry Holliday, 26, stressed she was \u201cnot guilty\u201d of helping make Johnson the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London. \u201cI only moved here a year ago so don\u2019t blame me for getting him back into parliament,\u201d she said. Asked about the loud argument, which was reported to police after neighbours heard screaming and crashing in Symonds\u2019 flat, Holliday added: \u201cI don\u2019t want him to lead this country but do I really think that that argument will stop him? If I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t think so. \u201cIt\u2019s not us the voters who are electing him, it\u2019s his fan club who will make him prime minister and I don\u2019t think at this stage anything he does will change their minds.\u201d Her colleague Aalia Rehmanji, 23, said the incident should have stopped Johnson in his tracks but, like Holliday, she believed it would not. \u201cMaybe, just maybe, the women in the Tory party who are electing the new leader will think twice about opting for Boris Johnson but, like Cherry, I guess it won\u2019t matter,\u201d said Rehmanji. John Hooker, drinking a pint outside The Three Tuns, a pub close to Uxbridge underground station, said he was proudly pro-Brexit and had lived in the Tory-dominated constituency all his life. But Hooker, 64, described Johnson as a \u201csilly sod\u201d for refusing to make any comment about the incident with Symonds in the early hours of Friday. \u201cAll he has to do is put up his hand and say, \u2018Yes, me and the good lady had a row. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but ours and it\u2019s over.\u2019 Once he does that then everyone will move on and forget about it. My only problem with Boris is no one has seen him around here in years.\u201d While Hooker is a robust Brexiter, another member of his \u201cMonday club\u201d drinks circle Liam McNamara said he voted remain. Yet despite opposing Johnson\u2019s policy of crashing out of Europe if, under his premiership, the UK cannot secure an EU exit deal, McNamara believed the row would have little impact on the Tory leadership contest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for him but it\u2019s not going to make a blind bit of difference what happened between him and his girlfriend. That\u2019s how most people will see this,\u201d said McNamara. Elsewhere in the heart of the constituency, Lorraine Kimber\u2019s elderly German friend Helen Lipskombe raised no objections when she described her hero Johnson as a \u201cyoung Churchill\u201d. As they sipped their coffees, Lipskombe, 90, nodded her approval and interrupted Kimber\u2019s gushing over the wannabe prime minister to say, \u201cYes, I love Boris too!\u201d Lipskombe moved from Kiel in Germany to England in 1948 and until March this year worked behind the bar of the local Conservative club for 30 years. \u201cI only met Boris once in the club during an election campaign but he was very nice, lovely manners, polite to everyone,\u201d she said. Kimber was outraged on Johnson\u2019s behalf. \u201cThey are out to get Boris,\u201d she thundered. \u201cThey are trying to do him down because they are desperate to stop him. He\u2019s too intelligent for his opponent so they will resort to anything. Bless poor Boris, he doesn\u2019t deserve this, nobody does. I still have faith in him, faith that he will take us out of Europe where we will be far better off. He really does remind me of a young Churchill.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
