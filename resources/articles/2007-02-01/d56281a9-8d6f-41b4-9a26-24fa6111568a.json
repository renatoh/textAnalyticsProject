While the media may be obsessed, and there is no denying that celebrity broadcasting and publishing attracts viewers and readers, does this then translate into celebrity association being good for brand marketers? Our research would suggest not. Conducted through Marketing UK, our study asked marketers from a sample of the top 1,000 British companies which techniques they thought were the most successful at building long-term relationships with customers. Celebrity endorsements ranked last, beneath techniques such as loyalty schemes, sales promotions, effective call centres and display advertising. In response to the survey one well-known commentator on celebrity endorsement conceded that research does indeed show that celebrities are only used in about 20% of all adverts, and that they are not on balance more successful than the other 80%. For a start, how much effort really goes into asking customers what they want and using this insight to develop personalised and engaging customer experiences? And how much attention is paid to making sure that customer enquiries (hot leads) are properly pursued to close a sale? Celebrity endorsement is an expenditure that has no direct relationship with the value of the customer and according to our research fails to engage the customer or turn their experience into brand advocacy. More \"boring\" methods deliver measurable payback to brand and customer alike. So isn't it time to ditch the celebs and start delivering real customer value? Graham Ede, chief executive, Connection, Globe House, Twickenham Why 24 promotes torture How ironic. At a time when the consensus against Channel 4 is that there is no place for racism in entertainment, Joel Surnow is given space (We're trafficking in fear, January 22) to defend the use of torture in 24, the show of which he is co-creator. Surnow cannot claim immunity from the concerns of the real world. Whether he likes it or not, his show abets those to whom the rule of law is an unwelcome hindrance, and helps create the kind of climate in which human rights abuses thrive. The readiness of some to torture has always been with us, along with the readiness of some to denigrate others because of their different skin colour, or cultural beliefs. Both are aspects of the human condition that instead of indulging, civilised societies fight hard to resist. Giving up that struggle in pursuit of ratings is nothing short of a betrayal of the generations to come. Andrew Hogg, Department of Policy and External Affairs, Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, London N7 The racism test In response to Danny Cohen (Offensive, but not overtly racist, January 29). It's not racist to call someone names, talk about them behind their back, make it clear you don't like them, exclude them, or be openly critical of them. It's not pleasant, it's immature, and it's not acceptable but it's not racist. Anyone who is singled out or picked on in this way by an individual or group is likely to wonder why - is it because I'm black? If it is because they are black then it is racist.
