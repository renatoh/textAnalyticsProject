It first climbs the Black Mountain before changing tack to take in the summit of Black Hill and turning for home. Why it's special Divis and the Black Mountain provide the backdrop to the skyline of Belfast, and the views are extraordinary. Belfast and Strangford Lough lie at your feet, while the Sperrin Mountains, Lough Neagh, the Mourne Mountains, Donegal and the Scottish coast can all be seen in good weather. Keep your eyes peeled for The Bobby Stone, an erratic deposit brought here by glacial action during the ice age. It used to be just one stone, but the Ministry of Defence blew it up. In summer look out for the purple heads of devil's-bit scabious, a wild flower on which marsh fritillary caterpillars feed. Recover afterwards As you're in the wild, get the bus back into Belfast and drop in at the Crown Bar opposite Great Victoria Street railway station. It's a lovingly restored Victorian pub. If it's tipping down Take shelter in the former cattle barn that is now the Long Barn visitor centre. How to get there From Great Victoria Street, take the Ulsterbus 106 to Crumlin via Hannahstown, and jump off at the Upper Springfield Road. Step by step 1 From the car park, head towards the Divis transmitter mast. Follow the wooden boardwalk to the right, on to the summit of the Black Mountain. 2 Walk straight down to the fence line, turn right and head to the summit of the Black Hill. 3 Negotiate the stile beside the field gate. Proceed with the fence line on your left. Continue until you are upon the telegraph poles and the fence takes a sharp left. Head left to the trigonometry pillar on the summit of the Black Hill. 4 With the trigonometry pillar to your back (facing away from the city), head straight down the hill. 5 Pass over the walled remains of the old gamekeeper's cottage, crossing the fence line at the stile beside the old mill dam. Turn left and pass through the kissing gate, returning to the car park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
