Flatshares are still a cheaper option for most renters than finding a place on their own. But, as the number of people who cannot afford to buy homes grows, prices are being pushed upwards. Figures from flatsharing website EasyRoommate show that since 2012, the biggest leap in room rents has been in Oxford. There, a combination of demand from students and some of the least affordable house prices in the UK has been driving up costs. EasyRoommate said the cost of rooms in the city listed on its site had increased by 29% since 2012, to an average of \u00a3571 a month. Other towns in the south-east of England have also recorded steep rises. In Reading, costs have increased by 23% to an average of \u00a3514 a month. In Cambridge, prices are up by 21% at \u00a3552. Separate figures from housing charity Shelter showed that in the past year, one in five working adults aged 20-34 have moved back in with their parents. A further 15% have never moved out. The charity said more than half of what it dubbed \u201cclipped wing kids\u201d had moved back because of the high cost of housing. A third said they wanted to save for a deposit for a place of their own, while a fifth said simply that renting was too expensive. London remains the most expensive place to rent in a flatshare, with the average cost of a room advertised on EasyRoommate heading rapidly towards \u00a3700-a-month. The average amount asked of flatsharers in the capital has increased by nearly 14% since 2012, to \u00a3692 a month, or \u00a38,300 a year. For that price, the website is currently listing 18 rooms available to rent, including a double room in Archway, north London, in a flat with three other people, and a room in Willesden, in north-west London, billed as a twin, which has bunkbeds and a kitchenette. The average rent for a room is also more than \u00a3500 a month in Brighton and Hove. The website said a survey of tenants showed that only in Milton Keynes, High Wycombe and Maidstone was the cost of renting less than the amount flatsharers said they could afford to pay. In London, it said people were stretching to find \u00a394 a month more than they had the budget for. EasyRoommate\u2019s chief executive, Karim Goudiaby, said: \u201cOur research reinforces the urgent need to replenish the housing supply in Britain with affordable accommodation. \u201cThere is a pressing need to tackle the housing crisis to mitigate inflation with rented room prices and to ensure Britain\u2019s renters can find a room that best suits them and their budget.\u201d Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cWhen getting even a toe on the housing ladder is completely out of reach and private rents are sky-high, it\u2019s no wonder so many working young adults are having to move back into their childhood bedroom.\u201d The charity said that current government schemes such as Help to Buy and Starter Homes, which will see new properties built to be sold at 20% below market rate, did not help people on ordinary incomes. \u201cWith plans to sell off many of the few genuinely affordable homes we have left, expensive and unstable private renting or living with mum and dad are the only option,\u201d said Robb. Dan Wilson Craw, policy manager at the campaign group Generation Rent, said the housing crisis was \u201cmuch more than a London problem\u201d. He said: \u201cRents are rising anywhere the economy is growing and that makes life harder for people who are already struggling or not enjoying a wage increase. \u201cFor some, moving back in with parents while they accumulate a deposit rent-free is the only way they\u2019ll get a home of their own \u2013 but not even that works if the only jobs are at the other end of the country.\u201d For those for whom flatsharing is not driven by a desire to cut costs, EasyRoommate said its most expensive listing was a double room in a two-bed flat in central London \u2013 a short hop from Oxford Circus. The room is listed at \u00a33,200 a month, or \u00a338,400 a year, although that does not include bills. At the other end of the scale is a room in Belfast, also with one flatmate, advertised for just \u00a3165 a month. Rents for a room in the city average \u00a3278.20 a month, the website said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
