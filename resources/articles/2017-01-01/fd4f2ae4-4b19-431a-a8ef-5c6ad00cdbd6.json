United required Ibrahimovic\u2019s header in the 84th minute to share the points on Sunday after Pogba handled a corner to gift Liverpool a penalty which James Milner converted. This was the headline mistake in a disappointing display from the 23-year-old, who cost United a world-record \u00a393.2m and had been among United\u2019s best recent performers. Yet Ibrahimovic said: \u201cPressure is something I enjoy. I don\u2019t know Paul personally to be able to answer that for him. But I think he likes it also because, without pressure, we would not be on our toes at the top level. If you want to play at the top pressure is 24 hours and if you play well or better the pressure becomes even greater. So it\u2019s something that we learn from and something we have to handle because we belong to the top. Paul belongs at the top absolutely and the pressure will be there.\u201d Last week Pogba became the first footballer to have his own emoji on Twitter. This was widely publicised, including on United\u2019s website. Ibrahimovic does not believe this affected the midfielder. \u201cI think football is like that today,\u201d he said. \u201cWith social media, the media building up the game. When I started to play football there was no social media, none of these things. But it\u2019s part of the game now. What is too much, what is too little? We don\u2019t know. We just follow the game. We are professional, we train like always, try to do our best every game. For Paul the [Liverpool] game was different. It was a \u2018dirty\u2019 game, in the way we had to play more direct, by jumping over the midfield because the pressure Liverpool put on us was hard. It was difficult and the first game against them was the same. The guys told me every game we play against Liverpool looks like this.\u201d Ibrahimovic likened outside pressure on him to that from a kindergarten. \u201cI think the pressure I have all around me is nothing compared to the pressure I put on myself. I really want to do, not perfect, more than perfect, every game, even in training. I\u2019m not happy if I don\u2019t win in training so imagine what it\u2019s like in the games. That is the pressure I put on myself and so your pressure becomes like a kindergarten for me. My pressure is really high. I\u2019m not satisfied if I get what I want. What I want is to win.\u201d Meanwhile, Louis van Gaal has confirmed he intends to retire from coaching despite the former United manager receiving an offer to manage a club in Asia that would have seen him earn \u00a344m in just three seasons. The Dutchman, 65, has been out of work since leaving Old Trafford last May and but told Dutch newspaper the Telegraaf that \u201cevents in his family\u201d have persuaded him not to take up another post despite the chance to earn a lucrative salary overseas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
