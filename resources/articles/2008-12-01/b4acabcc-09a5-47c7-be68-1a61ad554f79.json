You couldn't make it up. Boris Johnson is impaling himself on the bendy bus issue and will undoubtedly come a cropper. Bendy buses are a non-issue that ridiculously became the main debate in the mayoral election because of the failure of either side to present meatier topics in a digestible way. Boris should have quietly forgotten his promise to replace the bendy bus, or ensured it was stalled in the myriad of difficulties which it will undoubtedly face. Instead, Johnson is pressing ahead into the quicksand without realising that this will rebound back on him in a big way, and the reality of introducing a new bus with a retro design that ill suits it for today's streets at vast expense could be his undoing. I am no great fan of bendy buses. They are inelegant, and some routes do take them down roads that are too narrow to cope with them, but they do a fantastic job in moving large numbers of people far more efficiently and cheaply along major arteries in London than their predecessors. Londoners are pretty relaxed about them, and there is no groundswell of opinion to bring back Routemasters. Yes, they have their fans, but so do steam locomotives. Johnson is trying to cash in on nostalgia, which has limited appeal. Yes, it was great hopping on and off buses when they were stuck in jams, but it would be better if he focused on reducing those jams. Instead, he is favouring car drivers and wasting money by scrapping the western zone of the congestion charge. Worse, he let slip in a press conference the other day that he may well consider scrapping the whole congestion charge scheme. That would ensure gridlock returns to central London streets, and would slow down the bus service too. Various attempts by Boris cheerleaders such as Andrew Gilligan to produce evidence against bendy buses have failed, as highlighted by the Boriswatch website. There is no doubt that the replacement for the bendy buses will lead to a worse service for Londoners. And it will cost a fortune to deliver a new bus design from scratch \u2013 especially one that no other city in the world will want to use because of its retro nature. The designs for the new Routemasters look pretty much like the old ones. They are the sort of thing that any design competition throws up, looking very good on paper with elegant sleek lines but in practice they cannot overcome the problem of how to get people to the upper deck easily. Moreover, it is not just disabled people that need to be accommodated. Parents with pushchairs are now able to use buses easily, but not these. These buses will slow down the traffic because it will take longer to get on and off, and will require conductors, though Johnson now suggests that Police Community Support Officers could do the job. Just the sort of madcap suggestion that has passed from his flitty brain to his mouth in a nanosecond without recourse to any sustained thought. Why should PCSOs be cheaper than bus conductors? Meanwhile, Johnson has cut a lot of potentially vital schemes to improve London's transport, such as the cross-river tram and the Oxford Street shuttle. Forward-looking schemes to pedestrianise major squares, like the successful changes to Trafalgar Square, have been ditched in his bonfire of ideas. Those people who voted for Johnson thinking he was a bit of a laugh and good on Have I Got News for You will undoubtedly turn on him if his main achievement by 2012 is to make London's traffic situation far worse than it is already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
