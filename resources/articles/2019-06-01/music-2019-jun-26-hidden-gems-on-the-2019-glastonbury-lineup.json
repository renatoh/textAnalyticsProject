IICON will have artists playing from a giant sculpture of a head, and they\u2019re a who\u2019s who of cutting-edge electronics: galaxy-cartographer Larry Heard, dub geniuses Raime, thunderously angry poet Moor Mother, junglist poet Lee Gamble, South African pairing Okzharp and Manthe Ribane, and tons of forward-thinking techno: Bruce, Zenker Brothers, Karenn and more. Sleep all day, bring a carrier bag of falafels, and you could happily spend your entire weekend here. Georgia (The Park stage, 14.00, Friday) One of the year\u2019s breakout stars: this Domino-signed pop producer was due to put out her second album earlier this year, but the runaway success of its singles \u2013 the brilliant, Larry Heard-indebted Started Out and the Robyn-worthy About Work the Dancefloor have both climbed to Radio 1\u2019s A-list \u2013 has delayed its release to give her time to build. She\u2019ll have bangers for miles on a (hopefully) sunny Friday afternoon, and give you \u201cI saw her first\u201d bragging rights in the months to come. Langa Methodist Church Choir (Pyramid stage, 11.00, Sunday) If you\u2019re feeling a bit special by Sunday morning, it\u2019s raining and you just want to drive to the nearest Harvester, this lot will get you back in the game. Even the most godless will have their souls soothed by the sweeping, swelling power of this Cape Town choir, backed by simple drumming. The Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra (The Park stage, 15.15, Saturday) Had Barry White lived long enough, he would have made the perfect Sunday legend slot. But this year has the next best thing: recreations of the lush orchestral backings of his Love Unlimited Orchestra by the British Paraorchestra \u2013 made up of disabled performers \u2013 and a host of synth players. Out front will be a remarkably diverse range of singers taking on Baz\u2019s bass: Gruff Rhys, Nadine Shah, Larry Heard and more. Babymetal (The Other stage, 14.35, Sunday) Having embraced jazz, dance music and rap years ago, Glastonbury has been slow to bring metal fully on board but this year has a sprinkling of seriously brilliant names. Venom Prison and Employed to Serve are not to be missed, while the awesome Gojira \u2013 used to playing vast outdoor gigs \u2013 can be seen at the tiny Truth stage. If you just want to dip your toe though, check out Babymetal \u2013 the Japanese duo are far from a gimmick, with recent singles such as Elevator Girl and Starlight pairing awesome high-speed drumming with pure pop melody. Koffee (The Park stage, 14.00, Sunday) Spearheading the roots reggae revival is this teenage Jamaican singer, who flips between plaintive vocals and nimble rapping with enviable ease, and who can absolutely translate her talent to the stage. Stella Donnelly (Left Field, 15.00 Friday; 18.00 Saturday) Perth songwriter Donnelly has cited Billy Bragg\u2019s \u201cvery suburban, relatable way of talking about real life\u201d as a formative influence on her own brilliantly detailed, strikingly low-key songwriting. This weekend she gets to meet her hero on his Left Field stage, participating in Bragg\u2019s Radical Roundup on Friday alongside Emily Barker and Connie Constance, and playing her own set on the Saturday. \u201cI had to tell Dad to sit down when I called him about this one,\u201d she said. The Heatwave v Butterz (Clash, 00.00, Saturday) The Clash stage will bring together different crews in chaotic, combative soundclashes, and this pairing will induce absolute pandemonium: dancehall from the Heatwave meets grime from Butterz, resulting in more friction than a pair of chafing wellies. Nil\u00fcfer Yanya (William\u2019s Green, 16.00, Sunday) The gem of Glastonbury\u2019s sweetest, most indie stage, Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s sound falls somewhere between Sade\u2019s bruised heartbreak, the xx\u2019s intimacy, and \u2013 improbably yet brilliantly \u2013 the Libertines\u2019 most chaotic and galvanising moments. Her live shows mix volatility and earnest sing-alongs, with Yanya a guitar hero in the making. Yola (Avalon stage, 13.55, Sunday; BBC Music Introducing, 18.00, Sunday) With a voice that could carry across the whole of Worthy Farm, and excellent Dan Auerbach-produced songs to do it justice, Yola \u2013 from just down the road in Bristol \u2013 should by rights be massive. See her at close quarters before she inevitably ends up that way. The jazz takeovers In addition to individual sets, a number of London\u2019s boldest jazz collectives will face off in h2h smackdowns over the weekend: the Wormhole has the Comet Is Coming v Steam Down (00.00, Friday), Ezra Collective vs Sons of Kemet (00.00, Saturday) and Kokoroko v Joe Armon-Jones (00.00, Sunday), while London\u2019s jazz space Total Refreshment Centre takes over the Stonebridge Bar (16.00 \u2013 midnight, Friday) with the Steam Down Soundsystem, Emma-Jean Thackray, Emma Warren and more. Giant Swan (The Spike, 23.30, Thursday; Glade, 21.25, Sunday) Another local act, but from the other end of the musical spectrum, this Bristol duo recently and improbably played the Albert Hall supporting the Horrors. Their tough, swampy rave tunes, menaced by echoing vocals, are extremely Glastonbury-appropriate: untamed, joyously odd and just a little bit crusty. Hollie Cook (West Holts Stage, 12.30, Sunday) On a similar reggae tip is Hollie Cook, whose third album, 2018\u2019s Vessel of Love, was criminally underrated. Singing about romance and resistance, Cook \u2013 who played in the last incarnation of the Slits in her teens \u2013 updates the 70s lovers rock sound with dirtier production from Killing Joke\u2019s Youth. A Sunday-morning balm after the previous night\u2019s excesses. Bicep (Arcadia\u2019s Pangea, 23.00, Friday) The pick of the sets at the new project from Arcadia, they of the fire-breathing spider of previous years: the Northern Irish duo are already legends to a young generation of ravers, and combined with plumes of flame they are set to deliver one of the most euphoric moments of the weekend. They also play two only slightly less eye-catching sets on Saturday, at the Beat Hotel (21.30) and the Gas Tower (01.00). Peggy Gou (Sonic, 21.30, Saturday) By now everyone knows Peggy Gou\u2019s understated house shimmy It Makes You Forget (Itgehane), probably the only song to unite the usually disparate patrons of BBC 6 Music, Radio 1 and Mixmag last year. Whether or not she chucks it into her Sonic playlist on Saturday night remains to be seen; whats guaranteed is an abundance of glorious filtered disco and extraordinarily lush vibes. Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard (BBC Music Introducing, 14.15, Sunday) Buzzard by name and buzzed by nature, this denim-loving quartet play good-times rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and just wrote a brilliant swaggering anthem for the Homeless World Cup. If you\u2019re not swinging from the tent scaffolding by the end, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Shanti Celeste b2b Moxie b2b Peach b2b Saoirse (Stonebridge, 19.00, Thursday) Four women who have helped define a joyous, breakbeat-friendly corner of the house and techno underground come together to fire the starting pistol on a weekend of dancing. Kiddy Smile (Pussy Parlure, 2.00, Saturday) Paris-born Pierre Hache was trying to make it as a dancer in the mid-2000s but rejected for his size. He decided to throw himself into his own project, and Kiddy Smile was born, evolving through DJ sets that bounced with Jersey club and house, to voguing, releasing his debut album One Trick Pony in 2018, and acting in Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s movie Climax. Last year, he even DJ\u2019d for President Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, subverting the controversial invitation by wearing a T-shirt that made his position unequivocal: \u201cFils d\u2019immigr\u00e9s, noir et p\u00e9d\u00e9\u201d (\u201cimmigrants\u2019 son, black and faggot\u201d). He plays live at the Pussy Parlure after dark on Saturday. Keith Flint Appreciation Hour (Truth stage, 04.10, Friday) Expect tears before bedtime at this late-night celebration of the Prodigy\u2019s late green-haired mischief-maker. We don\u2019t know what form this is going to take exactly, but fires will be started in everyone\u2019s hearts. Sampa the Great (Pussy Parlure, 18.30, Friday) Zambian-born, Botswana-raised, Australia-dwelling rapper Sampa the Great emerged in 2015 and has been building ever since, supporting artists including Kendrick Lamar. It\u2019s a journey that her brilliant, brassy new single Final Form traces, celebrating growth over anxiety about not having made it. Jayda G (Wow, 22.00, Thursday) One for the early ravers: Canada\u2019s Jayda G is an environmental toxicologist by day, disco house maven by night, and responsible for one of the year\u2019s best albums in Significant Changes. Her banging live sets mainline the soulful DNA that links Chicago house, disco and R&amp;B \u2013 expect a radiant start to your weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
