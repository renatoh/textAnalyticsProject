Seven people were killed and 46 wounded here, including in two multiple shootings on the west side. The first of the shootings, in the Douglas Park neighborhood early on Sunday, left seven wounded; the second, in Lawndale hours later, wounded another seven and killed one. \u201cAs a city, we have to stand up and do a hell of a lot more than we\u2019ve done in a very long time,\u201d Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in an address on the violence over the weekend. \u201cThere are no adequate words at this point,\u201d she said of the violence. Often lost in national conversations about guns are shootings occurring every day in places like Chicago, which has continued to see high levels of violence, mostly affecting its predominantly black and brown south and west sides. \u201cIn Chicago, it\u2019s just another weekend,\u201d Father Michael Pfleger, a south side pastor and anti-violence activist, said of the national response to the city\u2019s deadly violence. \u201cIt gets forgotten and pushed to the side.\u201d Where mass shootings tend to command widespread media coverage, Pfleger said, violence in Chicago tends not to make national headlines. In part, he believes it\u2019s become an \u201cold story\u201d after years of the city suffering from a devastatingly high murder rate. But it also has to do with the fact that those being affected by the city\u2019s scourge of violence are mostly black and brown Chicagoans, he said. \u201cBlack and brown life being taken by gun violence is not something America has been concerned about for a long time,\u201d the St Sabina pastor said. \u201cIt needs to get the same attention,\u201d Pfleger continued. \u201cWe have 47 people shot and seven killed. If that happened over in Iraq, that\u2019s all anyone would be talking about.\u201d To erase everyday violence from the national conversation about gun control is to lose sight of the scope of the problem, according to Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cWe do that at our own peril,\u201d Brown told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not routine for the people who live in these communities, and it doesn\u2019t have to be accepted as normal.\u201d As studies have shown, mass shootings like those in Texas and Ohio represent just a fraction of gun deaths in America. Suicides and other homicides account for the majority of firearm-related deaths. \u201cWe need to look at gun violence as the public health epidemic it is,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe have to change the cultural narrative around guns.\u201d Doing so can be challenging, though, given the unwillingness by Republicans to act on commonsense gun reforms. \u201cThe shootings that occurred this past weekend in Chicago are certainly not taken for granted by the neighborhoods and families that experience them all too often,\u201d Rob Nash, chair of the board of directors for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, said in an email interview. \u201cThe only people who have accepted gun violence as being routine are public policymakers who refuse to take action to stop it.\u201d Brown said the Brady campaign was continuing to work on changing the national narrative about guns, and Pfleger is organizing a national demonstration in Washington DC, in September in an effort to pressure lawmakers into action. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna just do it,\u201d Pfleger said of gun reform. \u201cThey have to be pushed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
