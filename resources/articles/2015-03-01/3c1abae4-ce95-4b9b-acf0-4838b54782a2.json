Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt When does it premiere? All 13 episodes are available for streaming on Friday 6 March on Netflix. What is this show? Kimmy Schmidt (Bridesmaids\u2019 Ellie Kemper) is one of four women rescued from an underground bunker after being imprisoned for 15 years by a crazy polygamist cult leader. When she emerges she knows nothing of the world and has to figure out how to live in New York. Oh, and it\u2019s a sitcom. Seriously? It doesn\u2019t sound funny. Well, then you know nothing about doomsday cult survivors. What\u2019s the show\u2019s pedigree? Tina Fey and fellow 30 Rock veteran Robert Carlock created the show as a 13-episode series for NBC. They decided that they didn\u2019t want it, so NBC sold it to Netflix, which loved it so much they already ordered a second season. How does a show transition from NBC to Netflix? It is a dodgy move and the show retains the 22-minute format that network sitcoms share, including being broken down into acts. Some work has been done to smooth over where the commercial breaks would have gone, but it follows a familiar rhythm. Also, there are no swear words or anything that dirty \u2013 which is refreshing. What happens in the premiere? Kimmy and three of her fellow \u201cwives\u201d are rescued from a bunker in Indiana. They had been living there in isolation for the past 15 years after the madman who kidnapped them told them that the apocalypse had happened and they were the only humans left alive. On a trip to New York to do an interview with Matt Lauer (of course), Kimmy decides that rather than go back to Indiana, that she wants to stay in New York where no one knows she is a \u201cmole woman\u201d. She finds an apartment being rented by Lillian (Carol Kane) who comes with a roommate, Titus (Tituss Burgess), who describes himself as the gay Tiki Barber. Now that she has a home she has to pay the rent and stumbles into the job as a nanny for the rich, vain, selfish and slightly sad Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). Kimmy welcomes her new life with a smile that can only belong to someone who has yet to learn that both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston are now dead. Is this show any good? If Kimmy Schmidt knew what emoji are, she would describe it as sun, sun, crossout, rain cloud, smiley face, winky face, dancing woman, paint your nails. But Kimmy Schmidt does not know what emoji are (yet) so let\u2019s just say that it is very good and rather funny. Most of the comedy comes from the fact that Kimmy doesn\u2019t know anything about the modern world, and what she does know is incorrect, but she states it with kind the pluck and sincerity that makes you wish she was right. This is a girl who wears light-up sneakers and doesn\u2019t say she was kidnapped but \u201ctooken\u201d. That kind of attention to detail and fine characterisation will feel familiar to 30 Rock fans. It\u2019s not just the presence of Krakowski, playing a more moneyed version of Jenna Maroney, that make this feel like an unofficial sequel to 30 Rock, but the patterns of Tina Fey\u2019s comedy so evident in the writing. When Kimmy accidentally tries to strangle her roommate while sleepwalking she says his neck was covered in grease. \u201cI fell asleep eating a Hot Pocket,\u201d he retorts. If that\u2019s not something that Liz Lemon already said, it certainly sounds like it. What differentiates it from 30 Rock, however, is the darkness just below the surface. As unwaveringly happy as Kimmy is, she still tries to strangle her roommate because she\u2019s having a dream about being locked in a bunker. She has an unexplained fear of Velcro and when a man tries to flirt with her and puts his hands over her eyes and says, \u201cGuess who?\u201d she flips out. Making Kimmy deeply damaged but still inspirational and funny is a difficult line to walk, but this show manages it with aplomb. Which characters will you love? Pretty much everyone. Kimmy, of course, is a weird ray of warped sunshine that will warm your heart. Next to Julia Louis-Dreyfuss on Veep, Kemper as Kimmy is perhaps the best comedic performance on television. Her roommate Titus is a catchphrase slot machine, the hilarious jackpots rolling out with some regularity. And, finally, good on Fey and the other producers for finally bringing Carol Kane back to television. Which characters will you hate? Xanthippe (Dylan Gelula) is the boss\u2019s 15-year-old stepdaughter who is out to expose Kimmy\u2019s secret. She sort of plays the villain but is drawn as such a wonderfully obnoxious tweeting teen that you can\u2019t help being amused by her. What\u2019s the best thing about it? It\u2019s all the little things. The chyrons on all the fake news segments about finding the \u201cmole women\u201d are hilarious, as are Kimmy\u2019s malapropisms (she calls hashtags \u201chashbrowns\u201d). This is the sort of show that could benefit from multiple viewings, because the jokes are so packed in you\u2019re sure to miss something while laughing. What\u2019s the worst thing about it? The end of each episode after just 22 minutes. Should you watch this show? I can think of nothing better than sitting through all 13 episodes in a row on a rainy afternoon when you need something to live for. That something is a cult survivor who lives in a closet in a basement apartment in Brooklyn. Just trust me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
