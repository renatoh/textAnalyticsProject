On the recording Melania Trump discusses Stormy Daniels, who the first lady calls \u201cthe porn hooker\u201d. Wolkoff released the recording on Mea Culpa, a podcast presented by Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer. Cohen has also written a tell-all but Wolkoff\u2019s book, Melania &amp; Me, has perhaps become more of a headache for the White House, as the author releases recordings of conversations with the first lady that she says she made in self-defence. Wolkoff left the White House amid investigations of fundraising for the inauguration. In February 2018, the New York Times reported that from $107m raised, a company started by Wolkoff received nearly $26m. Wolkoff reportedly banked $500,000. The Times also reported that a government watchdog accused the inaugural committee of \u201cfiscal mismanagement at its worst\u201d. Wolkoff, who denies wrongdoing, says Melania Trump refused to defend her. Speaking to Cohen, Wolkoff said she had \u201cneeded to let a reporter listen to the tapes, because [the White House] made sure that people didn\u2019t believe what I was saying \u2026 once I had already been severed and accused of criminal activity. \u201cThe White House created a narrative,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t follow along with the one they wanted.\u201d That narrative, she said, was that the Trumps did not know about fundraising for the inaugural and any alleged improprieties. \u201cNothing took place without Donald\u2019s approval,\u201d Wolkoff told Cohen. \u201cNothing took place without Melania knowing.\u201d Midway through the hour-long interview, Wolkoff played a snatch of tape in which the first lady complained about a Vogue photoshoot from 2018. \u201cGo Google and read it,\u201d the first lady says. \u201cAnnie Leibovitz shot the porn hooker, and she will be [in] one of the issues, September or October.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Wolkoff asks. \u201cStormy,\u201d Trump says. Donald Trump denies an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. But Cohen orchestrated a hush money payment in the case, an act that contributed to his three-year prison sentence arising from the work of special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Wolkoff responds on the tape. \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cIt was yesterday it came up,\u201d Melania Trump says. \u201cFor Vogue. It will be in Vogue. Annie Leibovitz shot her.\u201d Leibovitz photographed Daniels and her then attorney, Michael Avenatti, for an August 2018 story entitled Stormy Daniels Isn\u2019t Backing Down. In her book, Wolkoff writes of meeting the then Melania Knauss at the Vogue offices in New York in 2003. Speaking to Cohen, she said: \u201cI actually opened the door for her while I was working at Vogue, and I think I was more of an attraction to Melania and Donald than they were for me. Because what were they doing for me? It wasn\u2019t as if I needed anything from them. I actually saw Melania as this nice, sweet, young, striving model.\u201d Cohen also asked Wolkoff about how the first lady reacted to reports of her husband\u2019s affairs, such as with Daniels, which the model says happened shortly after the birth of Melania\u2019s son, Barron. \u201cShe told me,\u201d Wolkoff said, \u201cthat Donald had to be prepared for his whole life to be open to the media, to the world if he won [the presidency]. And in that moment I thought to myself, \u2018And so do you.\u2019\u201d Last week, the Trumps both announced they had contracted the coronavirus. On the same night, Wolkoff provided to CNN a recording of the first lady complaining about having to supervise White House decorations (\u201cWho gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff?) and being criticized over her husband\u2019s policy of separating migrant families (\u201cGive me a fucking break\u201d)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
