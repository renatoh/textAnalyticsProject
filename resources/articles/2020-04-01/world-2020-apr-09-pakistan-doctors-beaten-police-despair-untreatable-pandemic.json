One doctor who took part in a sit-in on Monday to protest against a lack of personal protective equipment said he had been \u201cbeaten and humiliated\u201d by police. \u201cIn the beginning, I thought, \u2018How could police use violence against the frontline fighters of Covid-19 when some days ago the same officers had saluted us for leading during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d said Amanullah, speaking from the police station where he was being held in Quetta, in the Balochistan region. \u201cBut we were wrong. Sticks and butts of AK-47 rifles rained down on us. We were dragged through the street and thrown into trucks.\u201d He and about 60 other doctors were held in police detention overnight and only released at midnight on Tuesday. In the hospital where Amanullah works in the emergency ward, 16 doctors, including the head of the cardio department, have already been diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that how many patients they spread the disease to,\u201d he added. Many of the patients who he and other emergency ward doctors had treated for non-coronavirus issues have since tested positive for the virus. However, doctors in the state-run hospital still have not been provided with PPE and in facilities that have not been designated as Covid-19 hospitals there are no isolation wards for doctors who have been infected. Across the whole of Balochistan, which has become the focus of Pakistan\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, there are just 19 ventilators. The country has reported 4,000 cases of coronavirus, but testing rates are low and doctors believe the real figure is much higher. \u201cThere is a lot of psychological distress and trauma, as we have no idea how many patients we have infected or will be infecting,\u201d said Amanullah. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to march and demand PPE; not for ourselves, but to save the lives of many.\u201d Younas Elahi, a doctor working in a hospital in Quetta, said that for colleagues in the region who had not been given the necessary equipment, treating coronavirus patients was akin to suicide. \u201cDoctors are killing themselves in hospitals by treating patients without PPE,\u201d said Elahi. \u201cThey have no safe equipment. On the other hand, the government is unleashing violence against doctors.\u201d Without proper safety equipment, doctors have had no choice but to refuse to treat coronavirus patients, he said, describing the situation as \u201cinsane\u201d. \u201cWe are so vulnerable and it makes me cry when I see patients begging for help when doctors can\u2019t even touch them. The health facilities here are deplorable \u2026 I think this pandemic is untreatable in Balochistan.\u201d In one of the largest hospitals designated to deal with coronavirus, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, the capital, there are only 50 or so functioning ventilators. And two-thirds of Pakistan\u2019s population live in rural communities with no access to hospitals equipped to deal with coronavirus patients, or sometimes to any medical facilities at all. Dr Zafar Mirza, special assistant on health to the prime minister, Imran Khan, said the issue was not an equipment shortage, but \u201cirrational use of PPEs\u201d. \u201cThe federal government has supplied at least three times the requested quantities, but due to irrational use and leakages they did not reach the right people,\u201d he said. Since 2010, healthcare in Pakistan has been devolved to provincial governments, where there has been rampant mismanagement and underfunding, leading to wildly varying standards across the country. The dysfunction in Pakistan\u2019s coronavirus response also appears to go to the very top, played out in a public dispute between the federal government, provincial governments and the military over the decision whether or not to implement a full lockdown. On 23 March, Khan declared that he would not implement a national lockdown because of the impact on Pakistan\u2019s poorest. But just hours later, Murad Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province, announced a full 15-day lockdown in his state \u201cto save the people of Sindh from this epidemic\u201d. The military, who wield enormous amounts of power and influence in Pakistan, then stepped in and undermined Khan by adding their support for a full lockdown. On Tuesday, the military took the unusual step of providing emergency supplies of medical equipment to hospitals in Quetta, a job that would usually fall within the remit of provincial and central government. The apparent inconsistencies were defended by Mirza, who said that \u201ccentral and provincial governments are almost on the same page. We are a federation and there can always be differences of approach.\u201d Khan has also been criticised for underplaying the impact of the virus, which doctors say is resulting in incidents such as last Friday\u2019s, when hundreds of thousands of people across Pakistan defied restrictions to attend prayers. A doctor in Islamabad described Khan\u2019s recent public remarks that coronavirus has a low mortality rate and was not dangerous to young or healthy people as \u201cillogical and unsafe\u201d. \u201cIt is to scary to keep repeating this mantra to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cImran Khan is not taking it seriously: that\u2019s why the public and his supporters are not taking it seriously too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
