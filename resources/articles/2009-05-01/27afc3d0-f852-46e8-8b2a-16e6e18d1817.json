US late night talkshow host David Letterman expressed the view of people who haven't caught the Twitter bug, when he said: \"When you don't understand something, you make fun it. You ridicule it, and that's what I'm doing.\" In the future, they will write about it thousands of years from now that Twitter was the beginning of the end of civilisation, he joked, However, at the Thinking Digital conference in Newcastle, you'll have to work to find people who haven't got Twitter. Pioneer blogger and social media expert Stowe Boyd said of comments like Letterman's: Almost without fail when you come up with ways to get connected, people from the outside will say that what we are doing is illegitimate. He calls it as the 'War on Flow' because he describes social networks like Facebook and applications like Twitter as flow apps. They present users with constant streams of information and updates from friends. Paul Smith, aka The Twitchhiker because he traveled around the world based on the kindness of strangers on Twitter, talked about how the micro-blogging application had become an almost essential part of his work and life. To say Twitter is a social network, understates its importance. Not only did he use it as the basis for a round-the-world trip, but he also uses it for leads and story ideas. It has become essential as social support and contact in the often solitary life of a freelance journalist. One of the people who helped him was in the audience. He gave Paul his first ride. Why did he do it? \"It seemed like a good idea. I wanted to be part of it, and it seemed like fun.\" Paul said Twitter was also much more than a website. \"It's this incredible user-defined infrastructure.\" JP Ragaswami of BT said that Twitter had become a people-powered search engine. Many Twitter users talk of finding out something using what they refer to as the lazy web, and JP told of how his daughter's hamster had disappeared down a hole in the floor. He asked his followers on Twitter how to tempt it out. Someone suggested broccoli, and it worked. And in the quick-moving world of the internet, Twitter has shown enormous staying power at the leading edge of social technology. Paul noted that it was the buzz of the technology conference SXSW in Austin in 2007, 2008 and now this year. But Twitter is still living off venture capital funding. It has yet to come up with ways to make money so it can keep serving its dedicated fanbase. Dan Lyons, author of the Fake Steve Jobs blog, was also on the panel. He's famous for using the satirical blog for piercing what is often called the 'reality distortion field of Steve Jobs', the almost fanatical reverence that some Apple users have for Jobs and his sleek computers, iPods and iPhones. They don't call it the Cult of the Mac for the nothing. Dan was writing a story on who would be hurt by the downturn, and one of the first companies he called was Twitter. He mocked how the company described itself as 'pre-revenue'. \"Well, yeah, so am I,\" he said. It might be curtains for the company \"when the money runs out and there is not be a bigger fool to buy them\". He pointed to Google who paid $1.65bn for YouTube. Now, he says that Google might have to write off the cost of the purchase because they are being beat by Hulu, which is streaming television and movie content from traditional networks and movie studios. But for the near term, he says, Twitter will either get more funding or get a sugar daddy to bail them out. It sounded like he doesn't think that a prospective sugar daddy will get much out of the deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
