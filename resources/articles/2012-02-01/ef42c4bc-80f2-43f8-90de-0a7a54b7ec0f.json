But then he was asked about the way the 18-year-old plays with a certain innocence and the Arsenal manager let his guard drop. \"I feel that is always a brand of top players. They just play,\" Wenger said. \"When you saw [Wayne] Rooney start he played like it was natural, the same with [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas. They are happy on the football pitch and comfortable.\" Oxlade-Chamberlain certainly looked at home on Saturday and, although these are early days to be talking about him in the same breath as two of the most talented footballers in the world \u2013 he has played only 252 minutes of Premier League football \u2013 anyone who witnessed his performance against Blackburn Rovers could not have failed to be impressed. The irrepressible Robin van Persie walked off clutching the match ball and Thierry Henry marked what could be his last appearance at the Emirates Stadium with a goal (Wenger left the door open to the forward's loan spell from New York Red Bulls being extended to include the visit of Tottenham Hotspur). But it was Oxlade-Chamberlain's intelligent movement, dextrous footwork on the left flank and composed finishing that warmed the hearts of the Arsenal supporters who gave him a standing ovation when he was withdrawn. By that point Arsenal were 6-1 in front against a dishevelled Blackburn side and Oxlade-Chamberlain had registered his first and second Premier League goals, both of which were dispatched with the conviction of a natural finisher. \"I feel he could play central midfield, he could [also] play second striker because he has something that is exceptional \u2013 he has a short back-lift and so when he has a shot on goal it's difficult to block,\" Wenger said. Van Persie was also full of praise for the \u00a312m summer signing from Southampton. \"He is a fantastic player already,\" said the Arsenal captain, whose hat-trick took him to 123 goals, two beyond Dennis Bergkamp on the club's all-time goalscorers' list. \"He has everything. He's good on the ball, he's quick, has movement, technique. He has a great future. And he's not someone who thinks about negatives, just positives, and you can enjoy the game like that. I had that as well when I was younger. I wasn't thinking about 'oh, big stadium' or 'big game'. I was just enjoying myself.\" It was a display to put a smile on the face of Fabio Capello at the end of a difficult week for the England manager, who will also have taken encouragement from the sight of Theo Walcott wreaking havoc on the opposite wing. Walcott set up Van Persie's first two goals with neat cutbacks and later danced his way through the Blackburn defence to create Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain's second. Both wingers are likely to be in the England squad for the friendly against Holland this month. Pace remains Walcott's key asset and he is not blessed with Oxlade-Chamberlain's natural ability but this was not an afternoon to pick faults with his game. \"I love him, I honestly love him,\" Van Persie said of Walcott. \"I don't understand the criticism. Sometimes I feel that people are a bit harsh on him. If you look at his assists' rate, then it is unbelievable. And trust me, he will score. He will get 20 goals at least every season. Have faith in him.\" Apart from Morten Gamst Pedersen's exquisite free-kick, there was nothing positive that could be said about a Blackburn side who capitulated. Ga\u00ebl Givet's dismissal for a reckless lunge on Van Persie will bring an automatic three-match ban and deprive Steve Kean, the Blackburn manager, of another key defender at a time when Ryan Nelsen has departed to Tottenham and Christopher Samba seems unlikely to play for the club again. \"It's a position where we'd like to get it resolved as soon as possible,\" said Kean, when asked about Samba's absence. \"I think the way we are just now is not really helpful for anybody.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
