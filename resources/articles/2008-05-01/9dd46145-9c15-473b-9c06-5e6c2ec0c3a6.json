However, with three of the four fillies lined up for the Musidora Stakes this afternoon having only raced four times between them punters are involved in something of a guessing game. Lush Lashes has shown the best form, having run an eye-catching sixth in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket behind Natagora. She made up ground that day on a track that patently didn't suit in the style of one who will be ideally suited by today's longer distance. Impressive Sandown maiden winner Dar Re Mi was also tempting given the manner of her success, but Aidan O'Brien's powerful Ballydoyle squad has such a strong hand for the Oaks that the money for Moonstone (2.40), who is currently 7-1 favourite for the Epsom event, is difficult to ignore. She looked a filly of immense potential when runner-up to a well-regarded Dermot Weld colt last month at a time when plenty of the O'Brien horses were struggling to find top form. She is a tentative slection, though, and in truth this is a watching not a betting race. O'Brien saddles US Ranger in the Duke Of York Stakes, a race the bookmakers have priced up at the overnight stage. Six furlongs on fast ground should be ideal for this classy colt, who was badly in need of the outing in the Gladness Stakes last time when the very testing ground wouldn't have helped his cause. He has the look of one who could mop up some major prizes for his connections this term but is drawn out wide today in berth 17 of 18 and that tempers enthusiasm on a sprint track which can favour those drawn low to middle. This race has gone to horses drawn in single figures for the last ten years and with confirmed front-runner Beckermet drawn seven, US Ranger could find himself on the wrong side. The O'Brien runner may prove a class above this field in time but at the odds on offer a wager on Utmost Respect (3.10), available at 9-1 with Totesport, is more appealing today. The Ayr Silver Cup winner showed what he was capable of back at his favoured six furlongs first time out this term when romping home in what was admittedly a much weaker affair. He is the most unexposed runner in the field, however, and still on an upward curve. His trainer feels he may handle today's faster conditions. The opening race revolves around Folk Opera who looked potentially high class when snapped up by Godolphin after her third in the Lingfield Oaks Trial. Godolphin won this last year, she could be thrown in at the weights and Newmarket contacts report her going well, but with her yard struggling for winners she may start too short a price this afternoon. Tastahil (1.40), who was highly tried at two and ran a race brimful of promise behind the well-handicapped Bankable on his return to the fray this season, is the alternative suggestion. The best bet of the day is the Michael Bell-trained Allied Powers (4.55) in the last. Successful in a competitive race at Chester which is likely to throw up a number of winners, the selection has been found a suitable opportunity to follow up under a 6lb penalty. Ainama (3.45) can gain compensation for an unlucky Chester defeat for his shrewd connections. Ron Cox's tip of the day Generous Thought 2.10 York Huzzah's victory at Chester last week points up the chances of Generous Thought in the second race at York today. Paul Howling's progressive three-year-old only went down by a short-head to Huzzah on his return at Newbury in April - an event that has produced three subsequent winners. Generous Thought has been raised 6lb to a mark of 94 for that defeat but Huzzah scored last week off 93."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
