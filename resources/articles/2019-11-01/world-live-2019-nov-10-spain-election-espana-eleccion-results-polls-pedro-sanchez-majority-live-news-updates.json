My colleague Sam Jones has filed a comprehensive take on the election that was supposed to unlock Spain\u2019s political impasse, but instead may well have made things worse. You can read his full story here. He concludes Spain is \u201conce again bound for months of negotiations and horsetrading as it tries to form a government at a time of unprecedented political fragmentation.\u201d Spain\u2019s politics remain in deadlock after the centre-left PSOE party of prime minister Petro S\u00e1nchez shed a handful of seats but still won the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years, but his left bloc fell well short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in parliament. Despite the far-right, anti-immigration Vox party more than doubling its previous score and the conservative People\u2019s party also making sizeable gains, the right was also left without enough seats to form a government after the liberal Citizens party lost four-fifths of its deputies and was all but wiped out. The major national parties\u2019 final scores, compared with their tallies in April\u2019s elections, were as follows: Left 157 seats: PSOE 120 (down 3), Podemos 35 (down 7), Mas Pais 2 Right 149 seats: PP: 87 (up 21), Vox: 52 (up 28), Citizens: 10 (down 47) Pedro Sanchez tells PSOE supporters the party has won a clear victory and assures those urging him not to cooperate with the conservative People\u2019s party that \u201cthis time, yes, we will have a progressive government\u201d. He called on all the country\u2019s other parties to be \u201cgenerous\u201d in helping to break the gridlock, and promised the PSOE would be too. It might be easier said than done. The leading daily El Pais sums up the results of a vote that was meant to break the deadlock in which Spanish politics has found itself since the last one seven months ago: A poll that was meant to unblock the political situation in Spain has served only to complicate it, with losses for the left, a recovery for the PP and a huge boost for the far-right Pablo Casado, leader of the centre-right People\u2019s party which made good much of the losses it suffered in April\u2019s election, has also appeared before party supporters: We have shown that we are strong, and that we will continue to serve the Spanish people. S\u00e1nchez has lost his gamble. We are going to see what propositions he puts forward, and then we will exercise our responsibility - this political gridlock in Spain can no longer continue. Albert Rivera, whose liberal Citizens party has lost 47 of its 57 deputies, says Spain had voted to \u201cvalidate the PSOE\u2019s victory. Spain wanted more Sanchez, but also more Vox - and less of the centre.\u201d Rivera added that his future was in the hands of the party\u2019s members: What we got today was an unmitigated bad result - with no excuses. Given these bad results I believe that as leader it is my duty to call an urgent extraordinary meeting of the party executive. So what coalitions might be theoretically possible to form a majority government in Spain\u2019s seemingly intractably hung parliament? El Pais columnist Jorge Galindo lists some of the options here - while noting that they may be mathematically feasible, but politically, probably not so much ... With more than 99% of votes now counted, the centre-left PSOE party of prime minister Petro S\u00e1nchez remains Spain\u2019s largest party after the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years - but his left bloc has fallen well short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in parliament. Despite the far-right, anti-immigration Vox party more than doubling its previous score and the conservative People\u2019s party making sizeable gains, the right, too, was left without enough seats to form a government after the liberal Citizens party was all but wiped out. Having been ruled since April\u2019s inconclusive poll by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker administration, which failed to forge a coalition with either Citizens or the anti-austerity Podemos, the country now faces many more weeks - or months - of political deadlock and uncertainty. The major national parties\u2019 final scores, compared with their tallies in April\u2019s elections, were as follows: Left 157 seats PSOE: 120 (down 3) Podemos: 35 (down 7) Mas Pais: 2 Right 149 seats PP: 87 (up 21) Vox: 52 (up 28) Citizens: 10 (down 47) The far-right Vox party\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, is currently addressing crowds of supporters after its leap from 24 parliamentary seats to 52, making it the country\u2019s third largest party. \u201cLet\u2019s go get them!\u201d the party\u2019s supporters roar, as Abascal put its performance down to the fact it had \u201cled a cultural and political change by opening up all the forbidden debates and told the left that the story isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d Abascal added: \u201cThey don\u2019t have any moral superiority, and we have the same right to defend our ideas without being stigmatised and insulted as we still are by the media.\u201d Not to be outdone, Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s far-right League party, has also congratulated Vox, adding: I bet the headlines are already ready - \u201cextreme right-wing victory, racists, sovereignists, fascists ...\u201d Not at all racism and fascism, in Italy as in Spain we just want to live peacefully in our own home. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far right National Rally, has congratulated Vox and its leader Santiago Abascal for the party\u2019s \u201cspectacular advance\u201d: Since its return to democracy in 1975, Spain had been considered immune to the advance of the populist, anti-immigrant and far-right parties that have seen such electoral success in much of continental Europe. Respected El Pais columnist Jorge Galindo says that era has now come to an end: the 10 November elections \u201cconfirm the end of the Spanish exception in Europe: the Vox vote is already similar to that of the far right in Austria or the Netherlands\u201d, he says. With more than 50% of votes counted, it looks like a pretty good night for the centre-left PSOE; a very good one for the centre right PP; a spectacular one for the far-right Vox; a disappointing one for the anti-austerity Podemos and a truly dreadful one for the liberal Citizens. But above all, nether left the left nor the right bloc are anywhere near an absolute majority in the 350-seat parliament. The Guardian is now running live result updates which you can follow here. Here\u2019s Spain and Latin America specialist Michael Reid of the Economist with his view of the results so far: Results are now starting to come in - and Spain counts votes fast ... With nearly 23% of votes counted, the parties\u2019 scores and seats in the 350-seat parliament look like this: PSOE (centre left) 29.2% : 121 seats PP (conservative) 20.4% : 81 seats VOX (far right) 13.6% : 46 seats Podemos (anti-austerity) 12.4% : 32 seats Citizens (liberal) 35.6% : 10 seats Mas Pais (breakaway left) 1.6% : three seats With the far-right Vox party forecast by several late polls to become Spain\u2019s third-largest party, potentially winning as many as 60 seats in the 350-seat parliament, Guardian Madrid correspondent Sam Jones send this take: Although widely anticipated, Vox\u2019s apparent vault into third place - with almost 60 seats now predicted - is dramatic. Two years ago, the far-right outfit was viewed as an atavistic irrelevance. That changed, largely due to the Catalan independence crisis, in December last year when Vox won 12 seats in the Andaluc\u00edan regional parliament. It fared a little less well than predicted in April\u2019s general election, winning 24 seats. But helped once again by renewed tensions in Catalonia, Vox now seems on course to more than double its parliamentary presence. Its rise comes as the centre-right Citizens see their support collapse and the conservative People\u2019s party experiences a bounce back. The question now is what effect Vox\u2019s surge will have on the PP as negotiations begin to try to form a government. Teneo analyst Antonio Barroso pointing out the obvious, assuming the pre-election polls now being released prove anything like correct. With neither the right bloc nor the left approaching a majority in parliament, Spain is headed for more deadlock and more uncertainty: Javier Casquiero, the political correspondent of the leading Spanish daily, El Pa\u00eds, does the sums from public broadcaster RTVE\u2019s poll: In the worst case scenario, the right \u2013 the People\u2019s party, Vox and Citizens \u2013 would win 157 seats of the 350 in parliament, and in the best case 166. The left \u2013 the PSOE, Podemos and its breakaway party M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds \u2013 would have 147 seats in the worst case, and 156 in the best. At that point, speculation would begin of possible alliances with the regional and separatist Basque Nationalist party, Canaries Coalition and the Catalan nationalists. A second poll, carried out on Saturday and Sunday for the online news site EL ESPA\u00d1OL, is predicting roughly similar results, with the PSOE set to remain the largest party in parliament with between 112 and 118 deputies \u2013 as many as 11 down on its score in April\u2019s inconclusive elections. But the centre-left party\u2019s chances of forming a government \u201cwould depend on an arithmetic even more devilish than that of April 28, since the leftwing parties are even further from an absolute majority,\u201d the website said. \u201cSpain remains lost in a maze, with this election night not producing any solution to the institutional gridlock.\u201d The RTVE poll suggests the left (the PSOE party and anti-austerity Podemos) are on set to lose seats compared to April\u2019s vote, with the conservative People\u2019s party and far-right Vox making big gains. The big loser of the night looks set to be the liberal Ciudadanos (Citizens) party, which seems to be paying the electoral price for refusing to even contemplate entering a coalition with the PSOE seven months ago. Polls are now closed. This isn\u2019t an exit poll, but a survey conducted in the days immediately before the election which could not be published during the run-up to the vote. If it\u2019s borne out it looks like being an uncomfortable night for the centre-left prime minister Pedro Sanchez \u2013 it gives the rightwing parties the most votes, although well short of a majority. The poll, for Spanish state broadcaster RTVE, was of 13,000 people, conducted between 25 October and 10 November. Perhaps as a consequence of voter apathy, turnout at 6pm was 56.8%, nearly four points down on the same figure in the April 28 poll - but this is pretty much in line with recent November elections, so may not be significant. The Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, has an evocative scene-setter for today\u2019s elections from Guadalajara, about 60km north-east of Madrid, where he found voters feeling \u201cfed up and defrauded\u201d after four elections in as many years: \u201cNone of the politicians here seems to get it. We can\u2019t go on like this. We can\u2019t go on with more and more problems and more and more unemployment. People keep saying things are getting better but they\u2019re not.\u201d You can read Sam\u2019s full report here. One thing to watch out for this evening will be the performance of the anti-immigrant, far-right Vox party. After entering the national parliament for the first time in April with 24 seats, Vox, which favours a radical recentralisation of Spain, has seen its popularity soar, largely on the re-eruption of the Catalan crisis, and could well double its previous score. The parliamentary spokeswoman for the centre-left PSOE party, Adriana Lastra, made clear that this was an election in which everyone\u2019s vote would count: \u201cWe have to stop them,\u201d she tweeted, none too subtly. \u201cGo and vote.\u201d Good evening and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Spanish general election. Polls close soon in Spain\u2019s fourth general elections in less than four years, with the centre-left PSOE of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on course to remain the largest party. But after an inconclusive result in April and unsuccessful coalition talks with the anti-austerity Podemos, which now seems to be shedding support, S\u00e1nchez again looks unlikely to win enough seats to be able to form a left-leaning government. The right, too, seems set to fall short of a majority, with pre-election polling suggesting the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) will do well and the far-right Vox could surge to become the country\u2019s third-largest party, but support for the liberal Cuidadanos is in freefall.
