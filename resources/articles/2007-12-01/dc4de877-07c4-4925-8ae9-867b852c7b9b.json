We sounded the alarm when the plans for Kamaliyev's illegal \"administrative expulsion\" became clear. A lawyer was found. Since Kamaliyev is married to a Russian citizen - and an extradition request had been turned down a year earlier - this should have been sufficient to stop his expulsion. However, after many illegal expulsions, we knew more support was needed. And more was achieved. On December 3, the European court of human rights - whose rulings apply to Russia as a signatory of the European convention - applied rule 39, halting any expulsion, since Kamaliyev was at risk of torture in Uzbekistan. The court's notification was faxed to Russia's representative 24 hours before the expulsion flight. The Civic Assistance Committee in Moscow also faxed a copy to all relevant parties, who confirmed receipt. But the relevant officials said they had not been \"officially told\" and he was expelled on December 4. The western media was more concerned with the Russian elections. The next day, when it was too late, some media reported the story. All the election questions (Election results rigged, says opposition leader, December 8) overshadow an equally important one: how could a man be illegally expelled when the European court had prohibited this? And where will it end if the Russian security services can act with such impunity?
