The first of these was the annual tournament in Leon, the ancient capital of Spain in the north east of the country. It was in Leon that Gary Kasparov first launched his then futuristic symbiosis of man and machine 'Advanced Chess'. Nowadays playing with the help of machines has become, if not a commonplace, at least a variant which is starting to gain wider currency. However after experimenting for a few years Leon returned to straight rapidplay and this year's 19th edition, which took place the weekend after Turin finished - 7-9 June - was a four-player knockout with one of the strongest line-ups imaginable: the world's top two players, Veselin Topalov and Viswanathan Anand plus two other very strong grandmasters Lazaro Bruzon (Cuba) and the top Spanish born player (though Alexei Shirov continues to represent Spain) Francisco Vallejo Pons. While he has to defer to Topalov at classical time limits, Anand is generally accepted as the strongest rapidplay practitioner on the planet. But Anand's form in Turin had been awful - just 4.5/9 - and perhaps still suffering on the back of this he was taken to the limit by Bruzon who drew all four rapidplay games and even won the first blitz play-off before Anand equalised and finally went through after winning the fourth blitz game. Meanwhile Topalov's performance against Vallejo was much more convincing on paper since he reached an unassailable 2.5/3, albeit then losing horribly in the now irrelevant fourth game. However, his success belied the Spaniard's chances for the second game below turned through nearly 180 degrees in just a single move. After all this excitement, the final on the Sunday ended up being relatively low key. Topalov had good chances in the first game but failed to convert whereas Anand was ruthlessly efficient in game two. The other two games were both draw, the third fairly quietly, Anand pressing hard in the fourth. So Anand was victorious as he's been a number of times before in Leon - last year he beat Rustam Kasimdzhanov in the final. With worldwide access via the internet there is generally at least one good tournament in progress at any time. Currently there are two events at opposite ends of Europe: the Dutch Championship and the Aerosvit Foros Tournament. Always a strong chess nation, Holland, the current European Champions, were very close to the front at the mid point in Turin though they did fade to 11th equal at the end. The championship, which is in Hilversum, isn't universally powerful but does boast four top hundred players Ivan Sokolov, Sergei Tiviakov, Loek Van Wely and Jan Timman. Play continues until this Thursday and after five of the 11 rounds Tiviakov led with 4/5 ahead of Van Wely and Sokolov 3.5. Meanwhile the superheavyweight Aerosvit Foros tournament (sponsored by the Ukrainian national airline Aerosvit and held in the Foros health spa) is under way in Yalta. This massively powerful event averages no less than 2691 (category 18) with three players in the current top dozen - Ruslan Ponomariov, Vassily Ivanchuk and Alexander Grischuk; and the whole field in the top 50. Viktor Bologan from Moldova took the early lead but in round six he was defeated by the current Russian champion Sergei Rublevsky and going into the rest day on Friday, Rublevsky led on 4.5/6 ahead of Bologan 4. Veselin Topalov (Black to play) Francisco Vallejo Pons (White) In this extremely tense position White has several pieces clustered round the Black king but they aren't all focused on the same target - while the queen and knight can combine to attack g7 the rook is pretty useless in this respect. The Black pieces, especially the queen and knight are good defenders and after something like 31...Kh8 32 Nh6 Rc7 Topalov would have been doing quite well. However he blundered with 31...Nd2? 32 Nh6+?? This 'counter blunder' loses outright. Instead 32 Ne7+! gained the advantage. The only decent reply is 32...Kh8! since if 32...Qxe7 33 Rxg6+! or 32...Kg7? 33 Qxe5 threatening the fatal 34 Rxg6++. Then 32...Kh8 33 Qxe5 Qc7! 34 Qd4 Qc3! leaves White with a small endgame advantage and (32...Kh8) 33 Rf4 is extremely dangerous though it turns out that 33...f5! holds since after 34 Nxg6+ hxg6 35 Qh6+ Kg8 36 Qxg6+ Kh8 White must take the perpetual. 32...Kg7 33 Nf5+ Kh8 34 Qh4 and Vallejo resigned before Topalov could play 34...Nf3+. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Black) Alexander Areshchenko (White to play) I particularly liked Mamedyarov's build up in this game though the explosive finish was also very pleasing. 26 Qc2 Defending the e pawn to free the knight but allowing an important exchanging operation. 26...Ng8 27 Nc4 Bh6 28 Qd2?! Areshchenko said that 28 Bxh6 was better 28...Kg7 29 Bxh6+ Nxh6 30 Nfe3 Rf8 31 b4 cxb4 32 cxb4 f5 33 exf5 Nxf5 34 Nxf5+ Rxf5 35 b5 Ref7 36 Qb4 R7f6 37 Re2 Rf4 38 Qb3 Ng5! Compare the diagram. Suddenly all of Black's pieces are active and White is in trouble. 39 Nd2 Qf5 40 Rf1 Rd4! 41 a5?! 41 Rc1 was somewhat better. 41...Rd3! 42 Qb2 Qf4! 42...Nxh3+?! 43 gxh3 Qg5+ 44 Kh2 wasn't completely clear. 43 Rc1 Nxh3+! 44 gxh3 Qg5+ 45 Kf1 If 45 Kh2 Rxf2+ 46 Rxf2 Qg3+ 47 Kh1 Qxf2 wins. 45...Rxh3 46 Ke1 Rh1+ 47 Nf1 Qg2 and Areshchenko resigned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
