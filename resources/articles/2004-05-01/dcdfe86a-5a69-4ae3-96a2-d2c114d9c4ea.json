It is 90 years since any member of the royal family first condescended to attend the FA Cup final. Although Edward VII was the FA's patron from 1901 he never attended a match and it was not until 1914, with war looming, that George V was told it might be helpful to turn up to the last final at Crystal Palace between Burnley and Liverpool. His family had long been wary of the people's game. In 1890, for instance, the Prince of Wales and the court apparently felt rudely snubbed one Saturday when he launched a battleship at Seaham harbour, to which only 2,000 turned up, whereas down the road more than 25,000 watched Sunderland play Blackburn. Six years later his brother Prince Albert, having opened Burnley's Victoria Hospital, deigned to attend Turf Moor but courtiers were shocked to discover the Burnley chairman charging exorbitantly for grandstand tickets next to the royal party for the visit of Bolton. Down the years I happened to sit two or three times on the fringe of the royal box at Wembley and could never stop wondering what the poor, glum, regal VIPs were thinking about. Huntin', shootin', fishin' and corgis, I suppose? How they seemed to dread extra-time. Boycott back from boycott Test cricket again became real genuine Test \"creek-eet\" yesterday morning and it was good to welcome back Geoffrey Boycott to television with Channel 4. Before embarking on his battle with throat cancer - happily won, cross fingers - he had been banned from the BBC commentary box following the grand guignol French farce of his court case in Provence all of six years ago. Illness has not diminished a jot the dogmatic distinctiveness of the old boy's Tyke's-trill certainties, although he might think again about the space-age sunhat. An even more loquacious microphone veteran deserves a party as well tomorrow. Saturday, May 21, 1977 was callow John Motson's day of days, his first FA Cup final as a late replacement for David Coleman. Tomorrow he will describe his 25th and in tribute it seems fitting to reprint the very first three of young Motty's entries in the Private Eye's Colemanballs column named after his predecessor: \"So different from the scenes in 1872, at the Cup final none of us can remember.\" \"Nobody could have counted the number of moves Alan Ball made. I counted four and possibly five.\" \"That shot might not have been as good as it might have been.\" Plenty of teeth in Celtic Lions This time next year the Lions will have left for New Zealand - or, that is, the first batch, those with no involvement in the plethora of cup finals or play-offs. But what if they had been leaving today? Before the Six Nations this corner feared for the end of the Lions because world champion Englishmen would fill every position. Less than four months later such a proposition is ludicrous. Would any English back deserve a first XV place? Josh Lewsey possibly, maverick Jason Robinson perhaps. Certainly not at half-back, where it would be Ronan O'Gara, pressed by Stephen Jones, with Rob Howley at scrum-half, shadowed by Peter Stringer. Could any but a one-eyed Anglo complain if the Lions team for the first Test of 2005 should be: Geordan Murphy (Ireland); Gareth Thomas (Wales), Gordon D'Arcy, Brian O'Driscoll (both Ireland), Shane Williams (Wales); Ronan O'Gara (Ireland), Rob Howley (Wasps); Reggie Corrigan, Shane Byrne (both Ireland), Gethin Jenkins (Wales); Malcolm O'Kelly, Paul O'Connell (both Ireland); Simon Easterby (Ireland), Martyn Williams (Wales), Simon Taylor (Scotland)? Torrid times on two days in May Anniversaries - and omens. Sven the solemn Swede announces his battalion for the Portuguese campaign - in the very week that commemorates England's two most baleful continental defeats. In Madrid on May 15 1929, Spain were the first foreign team to beat England (4-3). Hot weather was the excuse: \"The Spaniards were very fast and made ground by speedy dribbling, and in fairness no words can describe the torrid conditions which prevailed.\" On May 23 1954 Hungary beat England 7-1 in Budapest. No excuse - as Sir Tom Finney recalled yesterday: \"They ripped us apart. I'm afraid it was sleek classic thoroughbreds against bewildered old carthorses.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
