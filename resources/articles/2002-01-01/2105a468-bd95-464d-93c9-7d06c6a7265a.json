Scotland will provide six of the stadiums and Ireland two. \"To create four [more] 30,000-seat stadiums is not practical or desirable,\" said Scotland's first minister Jack McConnell, who told the SFA as much yesterday morning. \"It would be expensive and there are serious doubts about whether we could guarantee four new stadiums to Uefa's specification in time for 2008.\" Hampden, Murrayfield, Ibrox and Parkhead already meet the Uefa criteria, and two from a revamped Pittodrie and Easter Road and a purpose-built stadium in Dundee would make up the Scottish part of the bid. Brendan Menton, general secretary of the Football Assocaitaion of Ireland, said: \"The Scottish government are prepared to support the SFA in redeveloping two of their stadia and indications are that the Irish government will support us. We are confident we will have two suitable stadia ready.\" The Uefa deadline for bids is in June but draft proposals must be finalised at the end of next month. Other candidates include joint bids from Switzerland and Austria, Greece and Turkey, Bosnia and Croatia, and Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland - and a solo offer from Hungary. Colin Lee is expected to be named as Walsall's manager today, replacing Ray Graydon who was sacked on Tuesday. Lee has been at Wigan since resigning as director of foot ball at Torquay last summer. He led Wolves to successive seventh-placed finishes in the First Division before being sacked in December 2000. Wolves have requested a personal hearing after being charged with misconduct in their game against West Bromwich. Several players had to be separated after a two-foot tackle by Albion's Jordao on Alex Rae. \"We feel hard done by as the most threatening aspect of the whole issue was the original tackle,\" said Richard Skirrow, Wolves' secretary. Everton's Abel Xavier, out of contract in the summer, has turned down a three-year deal and been placed on the transfer list. \"With the size of our pool of players, losing him will be a blow but that is football at the moment,\" said the manager Walter Smith. Preston have signed Dickson Etuhu, 19, from Manchester City in a deal that could cost \u00a3600,000 and also borrowed Thordur Gudjonsson from Las Palmas for the rest of the season. Etuhu agreed a 3-year deal, with North End paying \u00a3300,000 and a further \u00a3300,000 depending on games. Michael Knighton has agreed to sell Carlisle United to the Irish millionaire John Courtenay after nine years in charge. \"I have taken over lock, stock and barrel and I'm absolutely delighted,\" Courtenay said. \"The Knighton family will be finished with the club. I'm not kicking them out; they are perfectly happy to go.\" It was not all good news for Carlisle, however, as the Football League fined them \u00a325,000 for fielding Sean Friars against Mansfield in November when he was registered only for the Avon Insurance League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
