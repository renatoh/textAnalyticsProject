Tesco is expected to overtake the Argos Retail Group - owner of the Argos catalogue chain and Homebase DIY outlets - by the end of 2006 and then extend its lead, says market research group Verdict. Grocers such as Asda and Tesco have expanded rapidly into fashion, electrical goods, homeware and entertainment in recent years, using their huge buying power to offer lower prices. They are now experimenting with stores that sell only home and fashion ranges, and no food. Verdict predicts Tesco will take 3.6% of the non-food market this year - against 3.2% last year. Argos Retail has 3.5%. According to the market researchers the big grocers are winning customers from almost all specialist retailers and by 2007 will be taking \u00a31 out of every \u00a310 spent on non-food items. Verdict predicts that some specialists will struggle to survive. \"Casualties from almost every corner of the market are inevitable,\" the report says, pointing to retail collapses such as electrical goods chain Powerhouse. Verdict also suggests that grocer Wm Morrison - which has refused to wade in to the non-food market - will have to catch up or lose customers. Yesterday Asda launched a range of own-brand furniture, priced from \u00a315 for a small bookcase to \u00a3300 for a leather sofa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
