The 14-run defeat by Pakistan on Monday saw England come up short in this department, delivering a shabby \u2013 and costly \u2013 fielding performance amid a febrile atmosphere at Trent Bridge. Jason Roy and Jofra Archer were both fined for on-field outbursts, while there was griping over the ball\u2019s condition from centurion Jos Buttler during the failed run chase. With Bangladesh expected to bring vocal support to Cardiff \u2013 and having got under England\u2019s skin during their one-day series in 2016 \u2013 there is every chance of another tense affair. \u201cPakistan are pretty good like that \u2013 they can get niggly,\u201d said Liam Plunkett, who missed Trent Bridge but is now expected to return. \u201cSimilarly Bangladesh, India, they\u2019re good at doing that, [like] appealing quite a lot. It\u2019s just the way they like to play their cricket. \u201cBut we\u2019ve played in big competitions, guys have played around the world \u2013 at the Indian Premier League and Big Bash in front of big crowds \u2013 so it shouldn\u2019t be too much.\u201d Plunkett was also keen to stress that defeat to Bangladesh is no longer an upset. \u201cI remember when they beat England way back when and it was a shock defeat but there are no real shock defeats in this competition.\u201d It is a point that barely needs making. In the past two World Cups they have emerged victorious over England, most notably four years ago when Mahmudullah\u2019s first-innings 103 in Adelaide helped set up a 15-run win that resulted in Eoin Morgan\u2019s side crashing out of the tournament. Like England, Bangladesh have one win and one defeat to show for their efforts this time around, similarly beating South Africa at the Oval before a battling performance that ended in defeat by New Zealand on Wednesday. Plunkett, who took two wickets against South Africa but was left out for Mark Wood\u2019s extra pace, has a strong record in Cardiff, with his 11 wickets at 16 apiece including four for 53 against Australia last year. But how he fits back into the team remains to be seen. Chris Woakes could earn a breather, despite three wickets against Pakistan his first two spells were costly, before a strong showing at the death. Another option would be to drop a spin bowler given the short straight boundaries at Sophia Gardens. If so it would likely be Adil Rashid who makes way, with the leg-spinner\u2019s five overs in Nottingham leaking 43 runs, while Moeen Ali claimed three for 50 from his 10. That said, had Rashid\u2019s seventh ball not seen Roy drop the top-scorer Mohammad Hafeez, his day could have turned out very differently. Plunkett said: \u201cMaybe there were a few nerves at Trent Bridge. We were not at our best and we let ourselves down in the field. We have had a couple of days off. Hopefully we can start again fresh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
