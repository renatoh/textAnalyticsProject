If you use every last morsel, a high-quality, plump bird can be broken down into 12 or more portions costing less than \u00a31.50 each. Your butcher may even do all the work for you, separating it into drumsticks, thighs, breasts, wings, bones, head, feet and giblets. For many butchers, the remaining carcass is a waste product that they have to pay to dispose of, so they often sell them cheaply; some may even pop one in your bag for free. You can, of course, buy individual cuts, but that usually ends up much more expensive. Wings, however, are relatively inexpensive and, if they\u2019re from a healthy, properly grown bird, yield lots of meat. Although I\u2019m vegetarian, I do cook meat for my wife, and one of my go-tos is a broth made from a \u00a31.50 organic chicken carcass; once stock veg and grains or potatoes are added, that makes about four portions. Chicken broth Easy, cheap and delicious, bone broth is a comforting and healthy pick-me-up that\u2019s full of easily absorbable nutrients. When bones are cooked for a long time, the collagen is dissolved in the water and turns into gelatine, which creates a desirable viscosity that is filling, unctuous and savoury. Collagen is also known to be very good for our health: it\u2019s thought to improve skin and hair quality, relieve joint pain and help with gut health. 1 chicken carcass, cut into four or more pieces Stock vegetables, roughly chopped (carrot, celery, leek, onions, parsley, garlic, mushrooms, bay leaves, etc), to taste Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, removing any blood, then cram into a saucepan with some hardy herbs like bay leaves, thyme or rosemary. Cover with plenty of cold water, bring to a boil and reduce to a gentle simmer for three to four hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface; if the water level drops, top up with cold water. Strain through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, then return to the pan with a variety of stock vegetables (carrot, celery, leek, onions, mushrooms, etc), and grains or potatoes. Bring back to a boil, simmer until everything is cooked through, then season to taste and serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
