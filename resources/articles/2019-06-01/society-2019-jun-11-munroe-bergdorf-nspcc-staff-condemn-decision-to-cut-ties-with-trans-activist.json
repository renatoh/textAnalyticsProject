Bergdorf, a model and former adviser to the Labour party, announced last week that she was proud to have become the first LGBT+ campaigner for Childline, the child protection charity\u2019s counselling service. After criticism on social media that Bergdorf was an inappropriate \u201csexualised\u201d role model for children, and accusations that she was a \u201cporn model\u201d because she once posed for Playboy, the NSPCC announced 48 hours later that it would have \u201cno ongoing relationship\u201d with her. In an internal memo sent on Monday, the charity\u2019s CEO, Peter Wanless, acknowledged \u201ca great deal of public feeling\u201d and added: \u201cOf course we regret any hurt caused to Munroe Bergdorf.\u201d But in a letter seen by the Guardian, nearly 150 members of the charity\u2019s staff spoke of their \u201cembarrassment and shame\u201d and condemned the decision \u201cto cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf, a black trans woman, as a Childline campaigner.\u201d They wrote: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed about the treatment of Munroe by the organisation. In particular, we are concerned at the NSPCC\u2019s decision to replicate the experience that many trans children and adults experience in being subjected to abuse and ridicule and subsequently abandoned.\u201d The employees \u2013 said to be working in a \u201csombre\u201d atmosphere after the decision \u2013 said they were alarmed that the statement provided by the NSPCC failed to articulate the reasons for the move and to \u201cexpress solidarity with Munroe in the face of significant online abuse\u201d. They went on: \u201cOverall, there is a feeling of embarrassment and shame about how this has been handled and what it means to be an employee of the NSPCC.\u201d The charity had faced criticism from some on social media for working with Bergdorf, including from an account called Safe Schools Alliance UK, which was formed in May, and from the Times columnist Janice Turner. The Safe Schools Alliance account said Bergdorf had invited children to get in touch with her directly on social media and was \u201csupportive of children dressing as \u2018drag queens\u2019\u201d. Turner asked on Twitter whether the charity\u2019s decision to recruit \u201ca porn model\u201d as a campaigner was \u201cworth the cancelled direct debits\u201d, saying that by porn model she meant \u201cmodelling for porn title Playboy\u201d. Bergdorf posed for the magazine in 2018. Bergdorf\u2019s supporters have highlighted that the NSPCC has previously worked with the glamour models Melinda Messenger and Abbey Clancy. Bergdorf said in a statement that she had never appeared in porn but that demonising those who had was unacceptable. She said she was \u201cunbelievably sad\u201d that the charity had decided to \u201cbow down to anti-LGBT hate and overt transphobia\u201d. She said the NSPCC had \u201cdecided to sever ties without speaking to me, delete all the content we made together and backpedal without giving any reason why\u201d. Bergdorf has previously been fired by L\u2019Or\u00e9al after she said in the wake of racist violence in Charlottesville that white people should acknowledge that their \u201cexistence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour.\u201d She stood down from the Labour party\u2019s LGBT advisory board last year after newspaper reports revealed comments from her in her early 20s describing suffragettes as \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d. The NSPCC\u2019s statement last week said Bergdorf had \u201csupported the most recent phase of Childline\u2019s campaign, which aims to support children with LGBTQ+ concerns,\u201d though she had never been a \u201cChildline ambassador\u201d. It said: \u201cShe will have no ongoing relationship with Childline or the NSPCC. The NSPCC does not support, endorse or authorise any personal statements made by any celebrities who contribute to campaigns.\u201d The letter from NSPCC staff was signed by 148 people by the time it was sent on Monday afternoon. Members of staff told the Guardian that the mood among some employees was \u201cpretty sombre\u201d when they saw the charity\u2019s statement. \u201c[Some of us were saying:] \u2018I feel ashamed, ashamed to be working here\u2019,\u201d said one staff member, speaking to the Guardian anonymously. \u201cNone of us have said that before. We are generally very proud of what we do \u2026people are just pretty sickened.\u201d They said the fact that it came during Pride month was \u201cthe worst possible timing\u201d. \u201cWe are worried about how we show our support for young people at Pride,\u201d they said. \u201cThis reflects on us. The decision of our trustees reflects on us, but it\u2019s an inaccurate impression.\u201d They said it appeared as if the trustees had bowed to pressure from \u201ca relatively small group of people\u201d who had been in touch to lobby them. \u201cIf the trustees make decisions like that without consultation from people who have lived experience or who know this work, then where does that end?\u201d In an internal memo to staff seen by the Guardian, Wanless said \u201ca great deal of public feeling is being expressed about Childline\u201d and added: \u201cIt is vital that we don\u2019t let this distract from our fundamental purpose to be there for all children.\u201d He said: \u201cI am very grateful to all staff who have been working on this issue over the weekend. Of course we regret any hurt caused to Munroe Bergdorf following her support of our most recent Childline campaign. Those involved will take learnings from this situation going forward.\u201d Bergdorf told the Guardian: \u201cI never doubted the hard work of the Childline staff on the ground, especially their LGBT+ employees who have been working to make the charity more inclusive. I want to say thank you for their support. I\u2019m hoping that this is a teachable moment in how transphobia poses a real threat to the progression of our community and our individual emotional wellbeing and livelihoods.\u201d She said she saw nothing wrong with letting trans children message her \u201cas a friend to turn to\u201d and argued that drag was a \u201ccultural phenomenon\u201d that had no age limit. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing wrong with kids playing dress-up if that\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d she said. The NSPCC did not respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
