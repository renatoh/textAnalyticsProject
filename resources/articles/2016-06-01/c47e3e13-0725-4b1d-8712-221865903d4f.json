You can\u2019t have missed it. It is quite the talk of all Tilling. Never mind Brexit, Bremain or Brugger Off The Lot Of You \u2013 the major question of the last week, in most households, has been whether or not it is acceptable for a shoe chain to pass comment on leg hair. It all began when the high street footwear retailer Office sent out promotional emails with the subject line: \u201cShow a little leg.\u201d The attendant email, showcasing Office\u2019s summer collection of sandals, slip-ons and those weird, cloggy platform soles that seem somehow orthopaedic and slutty at the same time, advised readers: \u201cJust don\u2019t forget to shave them.\u201d This led to a heated debate on Mumsnet, kicked off by women who had read the email as an instruction to shave their legs (rather than, as it should grammatically mean, the shoes.) Terms like \u201cbody-shaming\u201d and \u201csexism\u201d and \u201cboycott\u201d were bandied about, as they now are in all debates about anything. Battle raged, between those who were incensed to have a shoe company pass negative judgment on hairy women and those who were irritated to see a lighthearted message taken so seriously. Gun to my head, I\u2019m in the former camp. The \u201cdon\u2019t forget to shave them\u201d message is clearly a joke, but it\u2019s a weak and uninteresting joke. It swims blandly along with the culture\u2019s boring consensus on female appearance; it is a reinforcing rather than a revolutionary joke \u2013 and its failure to go against the joyless, stressful idea that girls must concentrate on keeping themselves spindly and bald is not mitigated by any chance you\u2019d actually laugh at it. It\u2019s not that kind of joke. It\u2019s not the makes you laugh kind of joke. It\u2019s the \u201cHey, calm down, I was only joking!\u201d kind of joke. However, I don\u2019t think that makes Office a sexist company. Office doesn\u2019t have an opinion either way. What Office has is a PR or marketing department that has worked out that more shoes will be sold by the concept of shaving your legs than not shaving them. If they thought people would be quicker to buy their pastel mules and mary-janes with a \u201cLet it grow!\u201d message, that\u2019s what they would have used. But their focus groups and cash registers told them that a dippy, all-girls-together, post-feminist grooming tip would spin them up more money than a challenging, punky, fist-clench. They\u2019re probably right. I mean, their shoes are incredibly boring. This is not footwear for punks and rebels. They sell \u201ctaupe ballet pumps\u201d, for God\u2019s sake. Nobody in those shoes would have the imagination to pair them with stubble. And so it\u2019s not the shaving message, I realise, that really annoys me. It\u2019s the concept of \u201cpromotional emails\u201d at all. It\u2019s the whole stupid world we find ourselves in, whereby we can\u2019t seem to stop our personal contact details falling into the hands of departments with no other purpose than to fill the air with this kind of wittering crap about shoes and bags and holidays and \u201cproduct lines\u201d: advertising disguised as cheery personal messages, inviting us to \u201cjoin the conversation\u201d. Ugh. That is what has got to stop. But never will, now. As far as whether or not to shave your legs goes, the best tip I ever had on that was from an elderly lady who worked at Frank\u2019s underwear shop in Golders Green. I popped in there, many years ago, for some fishnet tights. \u201cTake my advice,\u201d breathed the ancient sales assistant, through coral lips rendered tubular from voracious cigarette consumption, \u201cand get a pair of nice, thick, beige tights to wear underneath. Gives a smooth look \u2013 and no need to shave!\u201d Inspired by that memorable style icon, I shall finish this week with a few beauty tips of my own. You\u2019re welcome. \u25a0 Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise\u2026 is the motto of people who are in the business of selling moisturisers. Your body is already 60% water. If that\u2019s not moist enough for you, sit in a puddle. \u25a0 Never take your makeup off before bed. Sleep in it. That way, you\u2019re all ready to go if a hot postman rings the doorbell early. \u25a0 Nature made your eyebrows like that for a reason. I don\u2019t know the reason. Some people say it\u2019s to do with keeping rain out of monkeys\u2019 eyes. Whatever. The point is, if you try to redesign your eyebrows with tweezers and pens it will look terrible. I know everybody does it these days. They all look terrible. \u25a0 Emulate French women and always carry a small dog. It distracts massively from your face. \u25a0 Blotchy complexion just before a big party? The failsafe solution is to use a mud pack. And then just don\u2019t wash it off again. \u25a0 A huge zit has developed on date night? Simply glue a chocolate button over it. Hey presto! A sexy giant mole. \u25a0 If you find it difficult to draw a neat line with an eyeliner pencil, start with a big thick wonky line and then reduce it with eye makeup remover. This is serious advice. I do this every single time I put makeup on. \u25a0 Heard about expensive seaweed wrap treatments you can\u2019t afford? Why not take a dip in Britain\u2019s beautiful Atlantic Ocean for free? I recommend the English Channel at Holes Bay in Dorset or the North Sea off Aberdeen City Beach. Seaweed is not guaranteed in either, but it\u2019s pretty definite you\u2019ll get wrapped in something."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
