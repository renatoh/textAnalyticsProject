Premier League chairmen, meeting in central London, decided 19-1 against forming a second tier, to be known as the Phoenix League, because such a move would dilute the unique brand established by the Premier League at home and around the world. Although no formal vote was taken, only one chairman spoke in favour of forming a second league, the rest being happy with the present set-up. The Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: \"By definition there can be only one Premier League. We don't envisage any circumstances in which Celtic and Rangers would be parachuted into the Premier League.\" The Premier League has always denied that such a plan existed but it did admit that its chairman Dave Richards had had informal discussions with a number of Football League chairmen over the issue. But no formal proposals were ever tabled and no formal discussions held with any Premier League officials. The chairmen argued strongly that they had to maintain the brand they had estab lished and that expanding the Premier League would damage this. Their biggest concern was that, if a second division was established, money from any future television deals would have to be shared out among more clubs. Scudamore added: \"This is the end of the matter as far as the Premier League is concerned. We can't see any clear reasons why we would want to tinker with a system that has worked perfectly well for us. Why would the 20 clubs currently in the Premier League want the situation and the brand to be diluted? \"At the moment we can bring focus to our work. I can't see any reason why we would want to expand the Premier League. When clubs talk about restructuring they are talking about finance. \"This has all come about because certain English clubs as well as Celtic and Rangers want to improve their financial standing. There is nothing wrong with that but I don't see why the Premier League should be dragged into something like this. The chairmen are very content at the current set-up.\" The chairmen's meeting also heard that a strategic review of their league was being undertaken in an attempt to assess how top-level English football would develop over the coming years and what could be done to maintain its image around the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
