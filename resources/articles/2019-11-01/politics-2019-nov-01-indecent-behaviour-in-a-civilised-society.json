This will not do. His behaviour, along with that of much of the Tory party, is indeed deeply offensive \u2013 beyond the point of indecency. Yet indecency is not a decent response to indecency. And Labour, after all, is the party of decency \u2013 of a decent health service, decent jobs, decent working conditions, decent housing, decent education and decent civil rights. Of a decent chance of a fair society. The Tories\u2019 indecent stripping away of much of the decency of our welfare state and social infrastructure should be vigorously fought with composure, dignity and, above all else, decency. Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire \u2022 Thank you, Aditya Chakrabortty (Food banks used to be an aberration. Now they\u2019re in children\u2019s books, 31 October). It would be hard to read this article and disagree that \u201cthis election is really about \u2026 how we define a civilised society\u201d. The only voters who could possibly disagree would be those whom JK Galbraith defines as belonging to The Culture of Contentment, unconcerned about how civilised our society is. John Airs Liverpool \u2022 The Labour party does not need to write a manifesto \u2013 the article by Aditya Chakrabortty says it all. A copy to every household would kill off the Tory party.
