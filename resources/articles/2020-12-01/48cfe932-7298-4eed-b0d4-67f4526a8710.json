Great spirit and comeback again but it\u2019s different to the Premier League ... you can\u2019t give a goal a three-goal lead and expect to come back. I thought the character and effort were there at the end. You can\u2019t say that we were good enough. We weren\u2019t good enough. We were in a difficult group and started well and obviously the big turning point was the loss away in Istanbul. That\u2019s where we lost points we should have got... Today we had to defend crosses into the box and we just didn\u2019t deal with them. We can feel sorry for ourselves tonight but then we have to focus on the game against Manchester City this weekend.\u201d \u201cWe started the game too slow. It wasn\u2019t good enough for the first 20 minutes We weren\u2019t at it and they scored the two chances they got. They put two balls into the box and we failed to deal with them. In the second half they scored with their first attack, from another cross. So we only have ourselves to blame ... We can\u2019t keep giving goals away and falling behind. I don\u2019t want to look at excuses. As a player, there are 11 bodies out there on the pitch you have to go out there and win balls, meet crosses, etc. the basics of football. It\u2019s not about the shape.\u201d Stay tuned for all the reaction from Leipzig, including, no doubt, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s response to the inevitable questions about his job security. Manchester United have been eliminated from the Champions League. This time they could not complete the comeback. They have been punished for a dozy start to this critical game, being outclassed for long periods, and relapsed into sloppiness to concede a third. Their milling and flailing towards the end came too late to save them. 90+3 min: Pogba curls over a lovely cross from the right. Mukiele stretches to cut it out at the near post but diverts it towards his own goal ... keeper! What a save by Gulacsi! Was that United\u2019s last stand? 90+2 min: Maguire is playing as an auxiliary striker now, lumbering around up front in the hope of getting on the end of one of the balls United are launching into the box. 90 min: United have at least four more minutes to save their Champions League skins ... 89 min: Swift passing by United to work the ball to Rashford on the let. He cuts inside, ignores teammates in the area and tries to beat the keeper from a difficult angle. Gulacsi bursts that dream. 88 min: Rashford receives a diagonal pass near the left-hand corner of the box. He lays it back to McTominay, who swishes it high over the bar. 87 min: A blind pass by Pogba gifts possession to Leipzig but they fail to profit. straying offside in their over-eagerness. 85 min: Leipzig try to keep the ball down near the United corner flag but they can\u2019t hold on to it... What a leap by Pogba! He soared at the back post to meet a corner by Fernandes and his downward header struck Maguire on the way into the net. Leipzig insist it hit his harm, but the VAR review declares otherwise. That comeback is on! 81 min: In all the excitement, I neglected to mention that Tuanzebe has come on in place of Lindelof. Thank you for your understanding. With his usual hop, skip and a jump, Fernandes sends the keeper the wrong way and slots into the far corner. The start of an unforgettable comeback? Greenwood and Konat\u00e9 go shoulder-to-shoulder in the box and the smaller man goes down. That\u2019s no justification for a spotkick, but the ref disagrees. 76 min: Fernandez curls an in-swinger in from the left. Rashford tries to get little eyebrows on it, but the ball bounces harmlessly through to the keeper. 75 min: Leipzig substitution: Adams on, Kampl off. 74 min: Fernandes unloads a respectable shot from long range. Gulacsi touches it over the bar. 72 min: Rashford ghosts past two players before Haidara wins the ball with an excellent sliding tackle. But United regain it quickly and work it to Greenwood, who tries to torpedo a shot into the far corner from 12 yards. The keeper gets down well to save. 71 min: Gulacsi tips a shot by McTominay around the post for a corner, then punches said corner to safety. Dithering in the United defence is punished by Kluivert! While Maguire and De Gea wondered who would deal with a ball rolling across the six-yard area, Kluivert nipped in and beat the keeper with an artful dink! 67 min: Freekick to United near the left-hand corner to the left of the Leipzig D. Fernandes curls a beauty over the wall ... and against the crossbar! 66 min: Fernandes fires off a dipping, swerving shot from over 25 yards. The keeper plunges to his left to push it behind, though it may have been heading wide. \u201cAt the risk of lobbing an incendiary sentiment into this mbm, isn\u2019t having an underwhelming \u2018star\u201d player as much a part of the modern-era United DNA as anything else?\u201d chips in Grant Tennille. \u201cVeron, Forlan, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger... Surely you can fill in a few gaps in my memory?\u201d 64 min: Rashford drills a shot wide from over 20 yards. 64 min: Pogba flips a nice pass through to Fernandes, who sweeps it beautifully out wide to Greenwood, but Orban intervenes with an impeccably timed tackle. 63 min: Maguire sees yellow for tripping Kluivert. 62 min: Nkunku twists and turns inside the United area and gets off a shot from the left. Lindelof blocks it. Then Kluivert gets booked for trying to pull back Fernandes. United substitutions: Can Pogba be United\u2019s hero? He\u2019s on for Shaw. And Williams has replaced Matic. 60 min: Shaw\u2019s freekick from the let fails to beat the first man. United\u2019s ratio of rubbish setpiece deliveries to good ones sinks further. Leipzig substitutions: Kluivert and Poulsen on, Olmo and Forsberg off. 55 min: Fernandez sends a lovely freekick from the right bouncing across the face of goal. Maguire strains in an effort to get his head to it at the back post but he misses it\u2019s fractionally beyond him! That\u2019s the best setpiece delivery from United all night. 55 min: Fernande with an outswinging corner from the right. Nkunu heads it away at the near post. 54 min: The threat from United is growing. They are looking much sharper, passing more snappily and running more ambitiously. 52 min: Rashford zigzags in from the left, working his way to the edge of the area and then feeding it wide. But the cross is cut out. 50 min: United force a couple of corners but they\u2019re well defended. 49 min: Nice play by United. Some dinky one-touch passing in the opposing half, with Van de Beek continually making the sort of proactive runs beyond the last defenders that were missing in the first period. 47 min: Van de Beek\u2019s first touch was to give the ball away. Leipzig have started the brighter, though not to the same extent as they did in the first half. 46 min: Van de Beek is on, in place of Telles. Presumably that means United are switching to a back four. \u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting that United could go through if Basaksekir win in Paris?\u201d hollers Gordon Dempsey. That would make no difference to United, Gordon, because PSG have a better record in the head-to-head game between the two. \u201cOle has Leipzig exactly where he wants them!\u201d chirps Peter Oh. Time to enact Plan B, Ole. United looked bewildered in the first half hour of this game and found themselves two goals before they got any sense of what their opponents were up to. Indeed, they were mighty close to falling three goals behind. They improved in the last 15 minutes and worked themselves into some threatening positions. But they need to get a lot sharper and more nimble to mount a comeback here. Otherwise their Champions League campaign is over .... unless something outrageous happens in the other game. 45 min: There will be at least two more minutes before half-time... 43 min: Leipzig break after a bout of pressure from United. Shaw takes out an attacker on half-way and cops a booking. Then the ref strides over to the United dugout to administer a stern telling-off to everyone who objected to his decision. 41 min: Rashford is fouled near the right-hand corner flag. Fernandes delivers the freekick beyond the far post. McTominay nuts it back into the danger zone, and Leipzig eventually clear. 39 min: McTominay releases Rashford after United win possession in midfield. Rashford tries to weave his way between the last two defenders but magic eludes him. 37 min: Maguire gets a meaty header to a corner by Telles but it\u2019s blocked by Konat\u00e9. And the ref blows for a foul by McTominay anyway. 36 min: For the second time in the evening, poor old Wan-Bissaka tries an extravagant piece of skill and winds up embarrassing himself. This time his attempted shot with the outside of his foot at the edge of the area results in him falling over. 35 min: Sabitzer booked for taking down McTominay in midfield after a strong run by the Scot. 33 min: As if buoyed by the VAR let-off, United begin to enjoy applying a bit of pressure at the other end. But it comes to nought. United breathe a sign of relief, as Orban\u2019s goal is chalked off. He was in an offside positions when someone else\u2019s header cam back off the post, which is why he was on hand to prod in the rebound. Meanwhile, the other match in this group - between PSG and Basahsekir - has been paused because of a racist incident. More details as I get them. Leipzig think they have made it 3-0 but the video ref is checking whether Orban was offside. 28 min: Wan-Bissaka confuses himself as he tries to play his way out of trouble, coughing up possession. Leipzig sweep forward and Shaw has to scamper across to clear before Forsberg can pounce. \u201cI have a feeling that Solskier\u2019s \u2018we love to make it difficult for ourselves\u2019 comment will come to haunt him,\u201d suggests Fatsani Sonny Gunya. \u201cI don\u2019t see teams allowing United\u2019s come back kings mantra play their minds. As for this German machine, I sense it\u2019s well oiled for the knockout stages!\u201d 25 min: United have improved, which was almost inevitable. Kongate concedes a freekick wide on the left by shunting over Greenwood. Telles wafts it into the area, offering Gulacsi an easy catch. \u201cSo what do you do when you\u2019ve set your team up to be as defensive as possible and concede two in the first 20 minutes?\u201d ask Ole Gunnar Sols David Flynn. \u201cIf I know Ole like I think I know Ole, he\u2019ll spend the rest of the game looking like an extremely worried 80-year-old infant and then hope Barcelona appoint Poch before Woodward thinks to sack him.\u201d 23 min: Freekick to United, about 25 yards out, to the right of the D. Fernandes blasts it into the wall and then clips the rebound towards Maguire at the far post. It\u2019s diverted behind for a corner. Telles takes it, Greenwood nod over the bar. 20 min: United are trying to assert themselves somewhat, or at least circulate the ball a bit. But they have shown none of Leipzig\u2019s movement or pizzazz and are being kept at bay quite easily. \u201cJust read Justin Kavanagh\u2019s thoughts and one match springs to mind, the World Cup final where he scored the winning goal,\u201d recalls Harry Crane, though it would be more accurate to say Pogba scored one of the winning goals and did not dominate the game. \u201cI really can\u2019t be doing with this lazy discourse that he hasn\u2019t tried or hasn\u2019t performed for United, when he has been in the team he\u2019s been first for everything that matters (goals, assists, passes) but for some reason because he doesn\u2019t scream at people when the rest of the team around him is terrible its his fault.\u201d There\u2019s some validity to that comment, but the point really is that goals, assists and passes are not the only thing that matter (and he should often prompt faster with passing). But, you know, chances are United are going to ask him to come on and help rescue them here in the second half. He could have the last laugh yet. Whatever happens. 16 min: What do you know, Angelino is galloping down the let again like a giddy little pony in a wide open prairie. And when the cross comes in, Forsberg is in splendid isolation right in front of United\u2019s goal. He takes a touch but then prods the ball wide from 10 yards. That sloppy finish aside, United are being schooled here. Achtung! United are in a world of bother! Once again they have been left flummoxed by Leipzig\u2019s movement. This time Angelino clipped over a cross from the right and Haidara was free to run on to it and rasp a fierce shot into the net! It\u2019s remarkable how often Leipzig manage to find a free player. 10 min: Wan-Bissaka cuts out a cross from Angelino, who ran on to yet another diagonal pass. The resultant corner is cleared. 9 min: That\u2019s better from United! The chance came from a counter, of course, as Greenwood dashed down the right and cut on to his left foot as he got into the box and cracked off a low shot that demanded a save from the keeper. 7 min: Angelino, pushed very far forward on the left, collects another crossfield pass and motors into the box. This time Wan-Bissaka is quick to close him down but the man on loan from Man City still gets a shot off, without enough power to bother De Gea. 5 min: No sign of a response yet from United, who still look stodgy. Leipzig are positively effervescent in comparison. 3 min: So Solskjaer\u2019s yet again finds himself hoping for another stirring fightback. His side have hardly started so far, although Fernandes has managed to pick up a yellow card to complicate matters. Oh my, what a start! And how easy it was for Leipzig! They had all of the ball sicne kickoff and were allowed to build gradually down the right and then a send over a cross. Angelino ran on to it at the far side of the box under absolutely no pressure and walloped a terrific low shot into the far corner! 1 min: Leipzig v Man United is go! Here comes the teams. There are no fans in the stadium so the booming rendition of the Champions League jingle is solely for the benefit of the players and officials. Leipzig are in their white jerseys with red and yellow go-faster trims, while United are back in black (just in case you wanted a different ear worm to the Champions League tune). \u201cScholes might have a point if this was the first time Raiola had sounded off like this,\u201d ventures Mark Gillespie. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s been a running theme for as long as he\u2019s been at the club, unless and until he does sack him or reign him in, the only conclusion we can draw is that Pogba is happy with the statements. The agent is the representative of the player and works for him, there is no justification for giving players leeway if their agents make comments like this, as they choose who represents them in the media.\u201d \u201cThe thing I will never understand is why people in the game talk about Paul Pogba\u2019s \u2018character\u2019,\u201d notes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cName one big match, for club or country, that Paul Pogba has truly dominated? Nor have we ever really seen him directing traffic in midfield (say yelling or pointing at those around him a la Keane or Gerrard). He cannot even control his Mr. 15%, yet this guy is supposed to be an influence in the dressing room? I know he\u2019s a talented footballer (when he can be arsed) but what am I missing here?\u201d Personality is not the same as leadership. It seems to me that he is generally well liked in the dressing room because he\u2019s fun, friendly and pretty successful - a likeable teammate - but no, he doesn\u2019t seem to demand efficiency, from himself or others. \u201cWe need everyone, all the 11 player who start and the subs who come on, to perform at their best.\u201d Asked to what extent Pogba\u2019s omission was determined by his agent\u2019s comments, Solskjaer replies: \u201cMy decision tonight is obviously tactical. That\u2019s the only thing. We made a team decision way before this game. We decided on Scott and Nemanja in midfield before we played West Ham.\u201d Though he then adds: \u201cFor me you prepare for every single game as if it\u2019s your last one, more or less. We know we\u2019ve got City on Saturday but that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d \u201cWhat does Donny Van De Beek have to do to get a consistent run in this team?\u201d demands Ian Palmer. \u201cMatic and McTominay are in ahead of him. I know who I would least rather face if I were the opposition.\u201d Entirely different kinds of players, no? And Van De Beek didn\u2019t exactly seize his opportunity at West Ham at the weekend. Discussing the recent comments made by Paul Pogba\u2019s agent - to wit, that he si determined to leave Man United - Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes take slightly different views: Ferdinand thinks United should have showed Pogba\u2019s agent - and others - who\u2019s boss and refused to give them the feeling the can sound off as they please without consequences; Scholes, meanwhile, thinks the onus is on Pogba to get a handle on his agent whose utterances, according to Scholes, risk creating the false impression that Pogba is \u201ca bad lad, trouble in the dressing room\u201d (the contrary is true according to Scholes, who says Pogba should either tell his agent to shut up or sack him. Oh look, here\u2019s the first email on what is sure to be a recurring theme: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge night for Manchester United so Paul Pogba starts in his best position,\u201d blurts S Wrap. \u201cThe bench.\u201d Keep it solid and pounce on the counter-attack: that seems to be the unsurprising strategy put forward by Solskjaer, if his team selection is anything to go by. Luke Shaw returns to first-team action after injury, while there will be a rotating cast of attackers, with Rashford and Greenwood presumably flitting where the see fit. Leipzig will probably aim to be more dominant but they\u2019ll be aiming to unhinge with fast and clever movement too. This promises to be entertaining.

It\u2019s another moment of truth for Manchester United: today we discover whether they are pitiable, rudderless drifters or a re-emerging force - at least until the next make-or-break day in Ole Gunanr Solskjaer\u2019s up-and-down reign. Harry Maguire cited last season\u2019s Top Four Decider at Leicester as evidence of his team\u2019s ability to show their class when it matters most, but three semi-final defeats in the same season stand as exhibits to the contrary. Still, that\u2019s the past: what we\u2019re dealing with today is a Champions League nail-biter in which a draw or a win will confirm United\u2019s progress from an exceptionally difficult group and defeat would lead to Europa League indignity and an avalanche of abuse for Solskjaer (and/or Maguire, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, David De Gea, the suspended Fred and, oh yes, Paul Pogba). United have reason to be optimistic. They tend to be particularly dangerous away from home thanks to their awesome counter-attacking power and, what is more, they whacked Leipzig 5-0 at Old Trafford in October, when the usually excellent Dayot Upamecano turned in a performance that rather discredited all those stories linking him with a future move to Old Trafford. But Leipzig have beaten PSG at home since then and came tantalisingly close to climbing to the top of the Bundesliga last weekend before conceding a late equaliser to draw 3-3 with Bayern Munich. United\u2019s bad-first-half/barnstorming-second-half routine might just prove to be enough today. But it might not. Either way, stuff\u2019s about to go down. This could turn out to be an epic contest that will make future editions of the brilliant Untied Rewind podcast even better, or it it could be a total dud \u2013 with baleful consequences. All in all, it\u2019s on!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
