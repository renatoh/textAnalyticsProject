Distilling the fruits of 50 years' scholarly work with lucidity and charm, Vermes challengingly shows how distant John's lofty divine extraterrestrial is from the tetchy Jewish holy man portrayed 35 years earlier by Mark. The Song of the Earth Jonathan Bate Picador, \u00a37.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL While the feminist and anti-imperialist demos of the 1960s and 1970s were accompanied by parallel trends in literary criticism, the same era's nascent ecological movement bafflingly found no echo in academia for another 25 years. Still clearly unable to believe his luck in having the field almost to himself, Bate centres this pioneering venture in \"ecocriticism\" on a study of Romantic nature poetry from Wordsworth to Rilke. Although the readings of individual poems are invariably absorbing, his contention that poets alone (rather than writers in general) can \"restore us to the earth which is our home\" is unconvincing. Is The Prelude greener than Moby-Dick ? Groucho Stefan Kanfer Penguin, \u00a37.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Groucho Marx's self-acknowledged heirs today include Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld, but they seem tame conformists when compared to the Marx brothers. While other Jewish stars of the 1920s and 1930s wore assimilated, usually sentimentalised, masks, the prankster sons of a struggling tailor and a Broadway wannabe remained punk-like \"permanent outsiders battling against dignity, power and reason\". Kanfer's intelligent biography combines illuminating insights into Groucho's sneering, leering comedy with astute analysis of why every woman in his life - two wives, two daughters, one trophy mistress - ended up unhappy, except Margaret Dumont."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
