The raids \u2013 part of twin inquiries into the alleged misuse of European parliament funds and suspected funding irregularities in M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s presidential campaign last year \u2013 took place on Tuesday at the offices of his party, France Unbowed, and private apartment. In video shot by reporters at the scene, M\u00e9lenchon, 67, railed aggressively at a police officer standing in front of the door to the party\u2019s offices in the rue de Dunkerque, near the Gare du Nord, repeatedly demanding he not be touched. \u201cWe are not thugs, we are not bandits,\u201d he shouted. \u201cIn whose name are you preventing me from entering my party\u2019s office? Go away and do your work as republican police officers. I am the republic; I am an MP.\u201d The far-left leader continued: \u201cAre you not ashamed? You are the police of the republic, or you are a gang? Do you know who you are talking to? You know who I am? Do I represent nothing to you?\u201d As the officer refused to budge, M\u00e9lenchon urged parliamentary colleagues and party staff who had accompanied him \u2013 several of whom wore the red-white-and-blue sash of members of the French national assembly: \u201cKick down the doors, comrades!\u201d The group subsequently entered the offices by another door and objected forcefully to the investigators\u2019 presence, prompting them to leave before the search was completed, according to a reporter from the Liberation newspaper who was at the scene. Later, standing outside, M\u00e9lenchon called the raids an \u201cenormous operation by a politicised police force\u201d, adding in a video posted on his Facebook page that the searches were \u201ca politically motivated act, an act of political aggression\u201d. He was not afraid of anyone, he added: \u201cThese people can invade my house, my party headquarters and my movement, but they will not scare me. We haven\u2019t stolen anything. We are honest.\u201d A source close to the raids, which targeted 15 separate addresses and included another leftwing party, said they were carried out by a specialist anti-corruption unit that focuses on financial and tax irregularities. Several French parties, including Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (formerly the Front National) and the centrist Modem party, are being investigated over their alleged use of European parliament funds to pay party staff in France. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said in parliament that he \u201cunderstood the emotion and anger\u201d of the far-left leader, but that the justice system was \u201ccompletely independent\u201d and the public prosecutor had acted entirely of her own accord in ordering the raids. A justice ministry spokesman said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to prevent investigators from carrying out their work. France\u2019s penal code allows for a penalty of up to six months\u2019 imprisonment for attempting to discredit the judiciary or challenge its authority or independence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
