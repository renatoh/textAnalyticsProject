The pull of family and old friends can be resisted no longer and his original plan, lest anyone forget, was to return to Brisbane this time last year. Who can say if his treble-chasing Leicester side would be in their enviable position had he done so? On the eve of Sunday's Heineken Cup final against Wasps, however, Howard is steadfastly refusing to bask in his success. He is not the type, at 33, to boast about the multiple achievements he has already squeezed into an eventful life. Even so, it is hard to duck the spotlight when you are on the brink of becoming the first man to win rugby's European Cup as a head coach and as a player. It is not bad for a former backpacker who, after this weekend, will walk away from rugby to supervise his chain of pharmacy shops. Imagine Sir Alex Ferguson doing something similar at the peak of his power. Win or lose this weekend, history should recall Howard as a talented man whose greatest ability was to keep life in perspective. \"He's a typical Aussie surfer . . . whatever the weather, it's sunny in his mind,\" says Simon Cohen, the Tigers' director of operations. The challenge until Sunday is to ensure his team stay upright as they prepare to ride the biggest wave of all. In a way Howard has already done the hard part. Earlier this season he removed the photographs of Leicester's previous European cup-winning heroes from the walls at the club's training ground. He wanted the current team to create their own slice of history and, so far, they have obliged. The Guinness Premiership title and the EDF Energy Cup have been stowed safely away and complacency has become an opponent. \"Just as happened to Gloucester, we could easily have one great week and then not turn up the next,\" says Howard, mindful of Leicester's Premiership final thrashing by Wasps two years ago when the Tigers seemed distracted by the pre-match focus on the departing Martin Johnson and Neil Back. Given Leicester's current mood, it is hard to envisage that happening again, even if Lawrence Dallaglio has claimed Gloucester were so below par that the Wasps A team would have beaten the Cherry and Whites last week. \"That's a little bit disrespectful to Gloucester,\" says Howard. \"If we turn up and play well, we'll win. If not, Wasps are the sort of team who can give us a lot of trouble. They are a very good side when they have some momentum.\" Howard will formally unveil his final-team selection tomorrow, with the fit-again centre Daryl Gibson coming into the mix. He will depart these shores convinced England have more talent at their disposal than their recent results might suggest. His parting message to the England head coach, Brian Ashton, and the forwards coach, John Wells, is polite but firm. \"I like Brian and I know Wellsy very well but I really think they should use the success the English clubs are having and adapt to what their players are good at. My philosophy in rugby is that I don't come in with a set game plan. We match a game plan to what we've got. The English have got some really talented guys at certain things. The game's in reasonably healthy shape. I wouldn't panic too much.\" It seems inconceivable that Australia will not come knocking at some stage but, for now, the third-generation Wallaby - he was capped at 19, his grandfather and father both played Test rugby and his mother's father, Cyril Towers, is regarded as the founding father of modern Australian backplay - sounds happy enough to be stepping off the merry-go-round. He still misses playing - he is a month younger than his captain, Martin Corry - and wants to reunite his young family with their grandparents. \"Anything individual for me can wait until after Sunday. I'll deal with it sitting on a beach somewhere. Having said that, I'll have some beers with the boys after the game, assuming they want to have some beers with me.\" The Tigers will miss their laid-back leader when he hits the road back south."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
