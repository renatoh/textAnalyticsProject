From the bench of bishops comes the sound of muffled squabbling \u2013 not, this time, over gay people or women but over the pressing question of whether a bishop can be married to a divorcee. The issue has weight because a possible contender for a diocese is one of the church's few rising stars: Nick Holtam, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square, London. Holtam is an inspirational preacher, pastor and broadcaster, runs St Martin's famous shelter for down-and-outs, and has masterminded his church's highly successful \u00a336m renovation appeal \u2013 more than most cathedrals can manage. So, what's not to like? Well, he's dangerously liberal on gay and women's issues, for one thing. And for another, he's been married for the last 29 years to Helen, who had a brief earlier marriage as a teenager. And that's all the excuse conservative bishops need. There's a moratorium on considering candidates who have been divorced (though at least one, the bishop of Hull, has been) or are married to divorcees, a move spearheaded by the reactionary bishops of Winchester and Hereford. They are being backed by John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, who is perhaps more ambitious and egotistical than his cuddly public persona suggests. To his credit, Rowan Williams wants Holtam to be a bishop, and there are several dioceses queueing up to consider him. Holtam himself is apparently not sure he wants promotion \u2013 and in the circumstances, with that bunch, who could blame him? \u2022 And lo! On cue comes the BNP's Nick Griffin, with a scriptural pre-election message to voters in Barking, garlanded with a quote from Ephesians 5:11 and complete with a picture of him grinning with Pastor George Hargreaves, black leader of the Christian party. \"To vote Labour is to support the party that has done more than any other to undermine Christian values, promote ungodly lifestyles and encourage the spread of Islam. Surely no believer can vote Labour and walk with the Lord Jesus Christ \u2026 simply search your heart and ask yourself: 'What would Jesus do?',\" he ponders, cheekily. Er, I think we can guess, Nick. \u2022 What sound like murky deeds are emerging in London's Tower Hamlets council election, where a letter to voters written in Bengali on Labour notepaper, apparently in the name of the party's candidate, Motin Uz-Zaman, warns residents not to vote for his colleague, Rachael Saunders, because she is a Jew and won't help Muslims, or for Kosru Uddin, because he is a gangster. This is odd, because the letter is accompanied by a copy of a webpage clearly bearing the name of Tory councillor Ahmed Hussain. Saunders and Uddin have complained to the Electoral Commission. Saunders, who isn't Jewish, happens to be a member of the Labour Friends of Palestine. \u2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry has decided to raise the whole tone of election night by setting a little quiz to enable viewers to test their maths skills while waiting for the results to come in. Sample question: in a politician's speech there are five sentences of 14 words, three of eight and two of three: what is the average number of words per sentence? That's an easy one, others are harder. Chief executive Richard Pike says: \"There can be much more enjoyment where there is a real understanding of losses and gains as they emerge through swings in voting. All the population should have the ability to do this quiz.\" But possibly not after a few drinks at one in the morning. Nevertheless, there's a \u00a3500 prize for the winner. \u2022 I bet the two teenage children of the candidate who has changed his name to Mr None of the Above to take on Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford will be pleased when Friday comes. \u2022 One final sartorial note for the election campaign: Nick Clegg surprised some by wearing a red tie on Wednesday. Subtle hint? No, just that he only has one gold and one orange tie, and both have got a little the worse for wear recently. \u2022 Thought for the day: today is St Prudence's day. And Tony Blair's 57th birthday. Spooky, or what?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
