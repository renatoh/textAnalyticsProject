So it wasn\u2019t 28.\u2019 Living up to his first name, Zohar Atkins is a rabbi and theologian, and a poet who can rhyme \u201cmystical\u201d with \u201clisticle\u201d. His first collection, Nineveh, takes delight in bringing disciplines and dictions together to interrogate history and each other. Incantation and instruction, meditation techniques and the social media, meet in this week\u2019s poem, which takes the shape of a parodic listicle. An informal Yiddish idiom adds homeliness and an ironical shrug. Let\u2019s begin with the title, which puts the \u201coy\u201d in \u201cpoyem\u201d. David Robson contends that \u201coy\u201d is a \u201cGoy proof\u201d word (questionable, I think. No word is anyone-proof!) He explains that \u201ca thousand Chasidic oys equal one extended Buddhist \u201cOmm\u2026\u201d \u2013 a nice listicle-style aphorism in the spirt of Akins\u2019s poem, adding that \u201cA single \u2018oy\u2019 does justice to almost any crisis and every ecstasy.\u201d A thought to hold on to as we read. \u201cPoyem\u201d carries perhaps an echo of \u201cpayim\u201d from 1 Samuel 13: 21-23 where it represents two thirds of a silver shekel, the cost of sword-sharpening. Poetry, and keen speech itself, have a price? At the same time, Atkins is alive to the sheer j-oy of his art, including its significance for meditation. There\u2019s an underlying awareness of what poetry can achieve through its own self-examination, and a potential for ecstasy as well as crisis in many of his poems. This one is ultimately a demonstration of the triumph of argument. Instructions are essential to both digital communications and spiritual exercises, but the result of the proposed 28, we\u2019re told at once, is \u201cnon-mastery\u201d. That\u2019s reassuring. The satirical emphasis throughout the poem falls on the commands and the promised reward, but the couplets suggest some profound logical investigation, as well as being funny. Even the first and simplest stimulates the brain-cells with its double-take double negative: \u201cClick here for 29 reasons / you are not not Mark Ruffalo.\u201d Ethical and mystical notes enhance the flavour of stanza three. \u201cClick next to receive yourself as a coupon. / Click Play Now to become forever.\u201d The results of the two clicks seem antithetical at a first glance, but both may represent forms of hubris, one material, one spiritual. I mentioned the aphorism earlier: conjuring aphorisms is one of the skills Atkins has brilliantly not not mastered. Poetry likes them, readers love them, at least when they\u2019re not glib or otherwise unearned. There\u2019s an underlying moral seriousness to their playful deployment by Atkins, when they are playful. Sometimes, of course, they\u2019re simply serious: \u201cEach second you give to thinking // will be matched by 30 minutes / of callousness, regret, and avoidance.\u201d The poem is a fine, bright-witted balancing act. Political anger is evident in the vision of a plague of digitised consumerist ephemera that eventually annihilates conscience. Even when cynicism is overcome, the result is (you) \u201cmake millions in emerging emotional markets\u201d. There is some sad wisdom about mavericks in stanzas 11 and 12. Then the mood lightens, as challenge and discussion take over. The final \u201cnu\u201d is a shrug and a saving grace. \u2022 Zohar Atkins is the founding director of Etz Hasadeh, \u201ca programme for seekers that uses poetry, philosophy, and meditation to illuminate texts and ideas from Jewish tradition\u201d, and a David Hartman Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
