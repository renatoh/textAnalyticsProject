Stop reading if you haven't seen episode 14 \u2013 and please, please don't post spoilers if you've seen future episodes. An exciting double bill tonight, with lots of action, lots of questions and \u2013 crikey! \u2013 a cliffhanger that will leave us all on tenterhooks for the entire week. The pace seems to have really picked up, and all three elements of the story are becoming more closely wound together. I can't at all guarantee that I haven't missed things below. Do please add your observations in the comments. The investigation: what do we know? \u2022 Hartmann realises that Olav Christensen could have been booking the flat for somebody else. \u2022 Lund finds out that Christensen has been paid an extra 5000 DKK a month for \"environmental consultancy\" - it emerges that money is authorised by Hartmann, through convoluted channels. \u2022 Christensen gets panicky, threatens to spill the beans, and confronts Bremer, who he believes has been using the flat. Bremer denies it. \u2022 Christensen is run over \u2013 apparently deliberately \u2013 and dies. The car is a white station wagon with a broken left-hand wing mirror. \u2022 Nanna Birk Larsen was seen meeting a man who drove a white car. \u2022 Troels does actually have an alibi. He was in the summer cabin that had belonged to his wife, where he had attempted suicide, as Lund guessed. Brix however, does not seem convinced. \u2022 The station wagon is hidden in Jens Holck's garage \u2013 when Lund returns to the car she finds her phone and keys are gone. She takes her gun from the glove-box \u2026 The family Heartbreaking stuff. Theis clumsily trying to force Pernille to move on, as she pushes him yet further away. Her conversation with Charlotte about the importance of finding the killer was perfectly done; her reaction at the graveside a sign of how close she is coming to unravelling. And as for Theis. Drinking on his own as his daughter is buried, unable to hold his family together. I worried that the family storyline would fall by the wayside as the political elements became more important, but this was beautifully balanced. The politicians We need to talk about Troels here, and an extraordinary episode in terms of plot and acting. The scene in Bremer's office was electrifying, partly because of its perfect twist (Too perfect? I kind of saw it coming, and it felt rather like Bremer did too) and partly because of a brilliant performance from Lars Mikkelsen. I was also convinced by Hartmann's reasons for not revealing his alibi \u2013 reputation and Rie. But also, of course, we should discuss Holck, who has always struck me as kind of shifty \u2013 but then he is a politician. If \u2013 and it is an if \u2013 he is involved, it puts an interesting spin on his line: \"I won't distance myself from you, but I can't be seen with you anymore.\" The police Really lovely stuff between Lund and Meyer this week - the gentle shifts of power are fascinating to watch. Meyer's expression when Lund walked out of Hartmann's door was an episode highlight, along with the moment in the cabin when he arrived at the same conclusion as Lund. Some nice dialogue too. \"First the Norwegian, now junior, I hope your mother stays put\" was my line of the night. Also, while I imagine the supremely highly-strung Morten probably didn't appreciate Meyer waving around a fruit knife, I was just thrilled to see him eating something that wasn't either fast food or a banana. Questions \u2022 What will they find on Olav's computer? I'm guessing not much. (Also: how did Rie just magically get the password?) \u2022 There's a lot of heavy hints being dropped around Theis at the moment. He told Vagn that it was \"his fault\". And then told the man at the hostel that \"neither you nor he can help me\". Guilt at not having told Pernille about Nanna's job, or something more? Was there a reason he packed up her room? \u2022 Was Lund actually properly flirting with Hartmann? \u2022 Do we entirely believe that Bremer didn't know who Olav was? \u2022 Was the wreath really from Vagn and his colleagues, or was he simply trying to ease Pernille's worries? \u2022 Should we still be a bit suspicious of Philip Dessau? Not least because he was the person to find the document about Olav's payments. \u2022 Brix is still bothering me. Whose side is he on? \u2022 And finally: a mention for @jayelizabeth's brilliant question on yesterday's blog: What health problem does Meyer have that can be cured by eating bananas? Is it a Danish condition? Observations \u2022 Lund still hasn't read the missing women files. \u2022 Bremer might as well have shouted BUSTED! at Lund and Meyer when he turfed them out for grilling Dessau. Hilarious. \u2022 Also on a political note, are politicians really so egotistical that they'd keep so many enormous pictures of themselves in their own offices? \u2022 Lund's spooky phone call wasn't really spooky enough \u2013 it sort of ramped down the tension about her flat, I thought. Also: there appeared to be some kind of yellow ballgown on a tailor's dummy behind her in the hall. Did anyone else see that? \u2022 We got a good dose of crime fiction social commentary tonight \u2013 the community's offer of a reward and the good work of the hostel juxtaposed with the violent teenage boys and, notably girl. \u2022 Lund's voicemail to Bengt was extremely sweet \u2013 and clearly a bit of an effort for her. \u2022 People always fall for Lund's requests for lists, allowing her to get a good snoop around their places. Jumperwatch Anyone spot a new style this week? I was pleased to see a good show for the original (and best) sweater in episode 14. But did I miss any new patterns?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
