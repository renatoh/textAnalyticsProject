The parallels, it should be acknowledged, are not immediately obvious. But before Owen's lawyers get in touch I would urge them to ask themselves this: are there two athletes around today who have been so unfairly ostracised by their sport, victimised more because of the herd-like mentality of those in charge than because of their perceived failings? Let's take Bonds, who at 44 still looks fit enough to play baseball and is desperate to do so. Yet it has been almost two years since he has swung a bat in anger. Apparently, he is no longer good enough for any team, which must come as quite a shock to fans of, say, the 2009 Washington Nationals, who make 2007 Derby County look like 1999 Manchester United. No one who knows anything about baseball believes that Bonds could not do a job for a major league baseball team; no-one except those who run the 30 MLB teams. The response of the Major League Baseball Players Association has been to file a grievance on Bonds' behalf, arguing there has been collusion between the owners to keep the slugger out of the game. Unfortunately for Owen the Darwinian marketplace of top-class English footballers holds no truck with fopperies such as grievance procedures. You are on your own here, mate. The England centre-forward has come to the end of his contract with Newcastle United and, like anyone else who finds themselves in that position, he is casting around for a new job. This he, or at least his agent, has done with a refreshing lack of ego, which might sound like a strange thing to say of a campaign which has as its centrepiece a 32-page glossy brochure. Yet this is how things are done these days. It's called marketing. Needless to say, this has been brushed aside in the rush to make fun of the brochure and of Owen, who has been portrayed as Yosser Hughes with more money than sense. There are a couple of things to say about this, one of which is to make the, admittedly unoriginal, point that we in this country take an ugly delight in seeing successful and famous people torn down and it is one of our least endearing national characteristics. In the case of Owen the glee has been heightened by the news the only clubs so far indicating an interest in signing him are Hull City and Stoke City, two of the supposedly \"unglamorous\" members of the Premier League fraternity. What constitutes \"glamour\" and its usefulness when it comes to stopping Fernando Torres are questions for another day, but for today there can be no arguments over what Tony Pulis had to say when declaring his interest yesterday in signing the England international for Stoke. \"He has had his fitness problems and they've been well publicised, but if you've got a fit Michael Owen then you've still got one hell of a player on your hands.\" Not for the first time, Pulis has shown himself refreshingly unwilling to follow the herd, the likes of Wigan chairman Dave Whelan who questioned Owen's \"bottle\" the other day. Even by Whelan's low standards, this is silly. Owen has played successfully at the very highest level for more than a decade. The idea that he doesn't have \"bottle\" is ridiculous, although not quite as ridiculous as the notion that he, like Bonds, isn't capable of playing at the very highest level. Given his injury problems, he wouldn't command a fee anywhere near to the \u00a317.5 million Liverpool have just paid for Glen Johnson but as a free agent Owen's transfer fee has already been set; it's nothing. His wages won't be nothing, of course, but nor will they be anywhere near what they were in the past. These are the news realities facing the former golden boy of the English football. That he appears, in his public utterances, to have accepted as much says a great deal about his character and ambition. It also suggests the only people lacking bottle \u2013 or indeed marbles - are those within English football who cannot see the bargain he represents. Lions tours no longer have the crowds roaring Price gouging has become a feature of modern sport, with the fans being asked to pay ludicrous amounts for everything from tickets to inedible burgers. When we were all as rich as Croesus this didn't matter but now our buy-to-let holiday apartments in rural Bulgaria have lost 96.7% of their value we are more inclined to stay at home and watch the big events on the box. What is true here is also true elsewhere, not least in South Africa, where the Lions have been performing in front of a disconcertingly large number of empty seats. There are even, whisper it, tickets still to be had for Saturday's second Test in Pretoria. All sorts of explanations have been offered, and all sorts of remedies put forth. Certainly ticket prices \u2013 scandalously high by local standards \u2013 are the most obvious reason, but I wonder if the empty seats are not evidence of a more fundamental problem. Once upon a time, a Lions tour represented the pinnacle of the sport. What does it represent now? A great money-making opportunity, certainly, but it is debatable whether or not a scratch team presents as much of a challenge to South Africa as would New Zealand, or whether the current series carries the emotional weight of the Tri-Nations \u2013 both of which would explain why the locals have been less enthused by the Lions' visit than had been expected. Too much knowledge can be a profitable thing Many years ago a friend of mine who played for Swansea phoned with a hot tip. His team-mate John Williams had qualified for the final of the Rumbelows Sprint Challenge at Wembley, where he would race against other pros, all of whom were much more high-profile than Williams (which at the time wasn't hard). \"He's a flying machine \u2013 lump on,'' was my friend's instruction. Being the last of the big spenders, I trotted down to Ladbrokes to slap down a tenner on Williams. The price, I believe, was 10\u20131. Williams duly romped home, beating the famously fast England full-back Keith Curle by the length of Regents Street. I won a hundred quid, although halfway through the Spanish inquisition I got when I went to pick up the cash (Had I heard anything about the race in advance? Did I know anyone in the field?) I was almost fooled into thinking I'd won a million. Cynicism comes easy to those of us who know a little about gambling in sport. Be suspicious, and work backwards from that, is not bad advice. Yet sometimes it is simply the case that the bookies have been \"done\", not by those who corrupted the outcome of the contest but by those who simply had a little more information about those taking part. I thought of Williams yesterday as various bookmakers made their \"concerns\" known about an alleged \"sting\" surrounding J\u00fcrgen Melzer's straight-sets defeat of Wayne Odesnik at Wimbledon. The Tennis Integrity Unit will conclude its investigation in due course but don't be surprised to discover that the \"sting\" was simply a case of the bookies being bad losers. Not even a household name in his own home As has become a tradition, the winner of this week's US Open made an appearance on the David Letterman Show to read out the nightly Top 10 list. Credit to Lucas Glover, he did the job well and with good humour, although perhaps No1 in the 10 \"Things Lucas Glover would like to say\" was a bit too close to the bone: \"Even I have never heard of me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
