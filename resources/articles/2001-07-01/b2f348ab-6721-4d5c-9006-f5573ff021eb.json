Next weekend there are more than 25 races taking place up and down the country, while in London alone, 10,000 runners will be slogging their way around Kew Gardens in the Nike London 10K and a further 7,000 will be taking part in the British 10k open road race around the centre of the capital. Being able to finish a 10km course in anything under 40 minutes requires fitness and weeks, if not months, of hard training. But there is more to preparing for a race than just pounding the streets. An increasing number of runners are buying electronic gadgets and equipment that can help them go that extra mile. One of the most popular gadgets on the market is the heart rate monitor (HRM). These may sound like the sort thing that you see advertised on a TV shopping channel, but they have been used by top athletes for years. Most work by a chest strap picking up electronic signals from your heart and transmitting them to a digital display monitor worn on your wrist. Once you have determined your maximum heart rate, a target zone for training can be constructed based on age, gender and height. The monitor will track how hard you are exercising and tell you whether to increase or decrease the level of intensity. It also lets you know when you've done enough for one session. One of the most popular brands on the market is Polar, which produce a wide range of models. The Polar Beat (\u00a339.00) is an entry level, no fuss, HRM that just gives the heart rate reading. It has hands-free reading, but it doesn't beep when you go above your target zone. For more intensive training its M21 watch (\u00a389.99) has a wealth of features including a calorie counter and stop watch as well as the capacity to store information from your last exercise session. Serious athletes may prefer the S410 (\u00a3149.99) which will download information to your PC and upload to the monitor without the use of an interface. This allows for in-depth analysis of your training schedule. Cardiosport is another manufacturer of HRMs. Its GraphX (\u00a399.99) is marketed as a complex machine that is easy to use. It has a colour graphical display of training zones and a single button operation for setting. It also has a chronograph and like most HRMs is water resistant. ProActiv's most popular HRM is the Cirrus (\u00a379.99), which unlike many other monitors has five training zones already integrated into it so you simply select the one that most suits your level of fitness. If the thought of exercising while wearing a chest strap sounds too complicated, then the recently launched Mio (\u00a3103 from the Heart Rate Monitor Shop) could be the HRM for you. Here your heart rate can be obtained at any time by simply placing two fingers on MioSensers which are located on the wristwatch. Alternatively, for women, the Polar Heart bra (\u00a329.99) incorporates the transmitter strap in a sports bra. Gadgets are also available to improve your breathing power. The Ultrabreathe (\u00a316.95) is an inhaler that increases the strength and durability of the respiratory muscles. As you breathe in, resistance is created by a spring loaded valve and as the power of the diaphragm and chest muscles improve, it can be adjusted to provide more resistance. Not quite so sophisticated are Clear Sport nasal strips (\u00a31.99), plasters which when attached to the nose are said to increase the flow of air through the nasal passages and so aid breathing. Of course having lots of technical training aids is all very well but if things aren't right in the foot department, they will be no use. The key to a buying a comfortable pair of trainers is to determine beforehand whether you over pronate, whereby the foot rotates inwards and downwards as you run or supinate, the opposite. You then can select the shoe with the correct amount of support. To prevent injuries some runners go further and have insoles custom built. There are also a number of off-the-peg ones available. For example, the Superfeet Synergizer (\u00a329.95) is an orthotic sole that claims to improve the efficiency of your running style and you don't need a biomechanical problem to benefit from wearing them. With even the best trainers in the world, painful blisters can still develop. This is often due to running in poor quality socks. Many serious runners wear thin 1,000 mile socks (from \u00a36.99) which guarantee blister-free running due to a unique two-layer system; the outer one grips the shoe while the inner one holds the foot. Blisters can also develop when the feet get wet so if you want to keep them dry, it may be worth investing in a waterproof yet breathable pair. SealSkinz's mid light sock (\u00a319.99) combines a tactel/cotton inner layer with a 100% waterproof membrane. Remember though that water may still get in from the top. If you do get a blister, there is emergency relief in the form of Compeed (\u00a33.99), a plaster that relieves pressure on the blister as well as forming an anti-bacterial second skin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
