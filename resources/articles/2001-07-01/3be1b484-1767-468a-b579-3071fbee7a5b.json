The mistake happened in quarterly statements which are sent out to some account holders in addition to their monthly statements. Barclays is to send letters of apology to all the affected customers whose personal details were sent out in error. But it insisted there was not enough information on the statements for the security of their accounts to be at risk. A Barclays Bank spokeswoman said: \"Unfortunately, some customers have been issued with incorrect quarterly statements. \"We are currently investigating the cause. In the meantime we will not be issuing any quarterly statements until we find out what has been involved. \"We would like to apologise to all those customers and will write them personal letters of apology along with revised quarterly statements.\" The spokeswoman added: \"No customers would have lost any money as a result of this and no one could have done anything with the information.\" The bank has 8.3m current account holders and some 500,000 are understood to receive the quarterly statements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
