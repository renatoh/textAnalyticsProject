Do you mean plaits? No, braids. As worn by many of Nigeria's football team, including its captain Jay-Jay Okocha and top striker Nwankwo Kanu. Too many, in fact. Says who? President Otunba Olusegun Runshewe, that's who. He's also taken against footballers sporting dreadlocks and jewellery. But why? In his own words: \"Our youths are taking after our great football stars ... don't forget that in the developing world the braiding of hair has a sense of homosexuality.\" And he's worried people will confuse them with rugby players? Not exactly. He's afraid that the beautiful game, whose players are worshipped even more ardently in Nigeria than they are here, is gaying up his nation. But aren't braids part of the African tradition, reaching back to time immemorial? Tell that to senior Nigerian football administrator Ahmed Lawan, who has told youth competition referees to ban any players committing follicular fouls. Lest other players catch homosexuality from their hair? One assumes so. What does he suggest be done with the dreadlocked detritus? He recommends that they \"should be even suspended for some years\". You can't ban footballers for having hairstyles some people find offensive. What would have become of Kevin Keegan? Stan Bowles? Brian Kilcline? Banished to the fringes of footballing history, that's for sure. Where does Runshewe stand on afros? Would Cyrille Regis have been bounced off the pitch, too? There's no word yet on their place in the president's trichological semiology. But this is all nonsense. David Beckham has worn braids, and jewellery, and he's an avowed heterosexual. He's also a gay icon, so you may not want to make him the main plank of your argument. Not to be confused with: Bunches."}, "isHosted": false}}}
