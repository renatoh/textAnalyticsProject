The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) has confirmed it has received a payment from Queensland Nickel, wholly owned by Palmer, of $6.8m. \u201cThe payment reflects the debt which originally fell due in June 2013 in the amount of $6.1m, plus 20% interest per annum, through to 31 December, 2013. The amount paid clears the debt as it stood at 31 December, but it does not include interest accrued at the rate of 20% per annum since then,\u201d the CER said. \u201cA further debt in the amount of $2.27m fell due in February 2014 at the end of the final surrender period. The Clean Energy Regulator will continue to pursue the debts using appropriate means, including payment plans and court proceedings.\u201d Palmer, who has been demanding the carbon tax repeal be made retrospective, said in Perth on Tuesday that Queensland Nickel\u2019s carbon tax bill had been \u201cpaid in full\u201d. \u201cMost people pay their tax bill just before it\u2019s due,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
