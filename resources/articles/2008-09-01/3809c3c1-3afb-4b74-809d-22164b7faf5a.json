There are rumours of extra revenue from commercial sources, the promise of glory in 2012 and unlimited access to Garry Richardson. Yet surely the most persuasive argument for sticking with the amateurs would be those photos of Britain's boxing hero from four years ago in Athens, Amir Khan, slumped in the corner of the ring, wearing the stunned and bewildered expression of a man who's just merrily pulled the handle of a fruit machine, only to have a 10-ton weight land on his head. Khan had walked on to a left hand from the spindle-shanked Colombian banger Breidis Prescott that called to mind Bundini Brown's description of a particularly concussive Joe Frazier hook: \"That one blew out all the candles on the birthday cake.\" Brown's friend and paymaster, Muhammad Ali, said that whenever he fought he imagined that his opponent was trying to push him through a door into a room filled with the bizarre and the strange, a chaotic zone where nothing made sense and \"crocodiles played trombones\". On Saturday Khan looked like he had not only crossed the threshold, but was midway through playing the bongos in a jam session with a band of walking handbags. I have had my fears about Khan for some time now, partly because he has still to acquire a persuasive nickname - though as one correspondent has helpfully pointed out, Amir 'The Wrath Of' Khan has a nice ring to it and would certainly help the Bolton lightweight gain a slice of the lucrative Star Trek demographic - but mainly because he has lately started going on and on about his \"power\". \"He will not live with my power,\" he has begun saying. \"He will never have experienced anything like my power. My power is awesome.\" In my experience, when a fighter starts banging on and on about his power, you can guarantee that his lights are going to go out very soon. It can't be easy. I imagine that in boxing, going from the amateur ranks to live with the professionals must be a bit like leaving primary for secondary school. Suddenly you have left a world where everyone is looking out for you and trying to build your confidence, and entered instead a place filled with people who exhibit a baffling and frankly scary level of evil and malice (and yes, that is just the PE teachers). When the former British light-heavyweight Dennis Andries went over to train at the Kronk Gym in Detroit, he noticed that the canvas floor of the ring was slippery. \"How come this is wet?\" he asked one of the regulars. \"It's blood,\" came the reply. A decade or so ago, I was sitting in the back room of a bungalow in Stockton-on-Tees with a retired welding engineer who had once been a celebrated name in North-eastern football circles. We sat at a table covered with his scrapbooks and the programmes of big games in which he had played. Every so often his wife would come in with tea and a plate of custard creams, tut, and say: \"Are you still boring this poor lad with your blooming old stories?\" This, of course, is the ultimate fate of all heroes. Glorious deeds when oft recounted, quickly become tedious to those who have heard them most. I imagine that on Ithaca, whenever they saw the elderly Odysseus enter the taverna, the regulars would mutter a warning to strangers: \"What ever you do, for god's sake don't mention the Cyclops.\" A few years back a former Manchester City player told me that when Alan Ball was the manager at Maine Road, he had brought up the 1966 World Cup final at least once a day. After a while everybody was sick of it. \"I said to the other lads,\" the player recalled, \"I'm going to get a replica of the Jules Rimet trophy made for me. I'm going to bring it in here and the next time he mentions Sir Alf Ramsey, Bobby Moore or Geoff bloody Hurst I'm going to ram it right up his arse.\" The retired welding engineer didn't bore me at all, I should say. He was full of funny stories about pitch invasions and homing pigeons carrying the half-time results back to expectant fans. He had played for one of the famous Northern League clubs and had picked up an FA Amateur Cup winners' medal at 18. He recalled an early encounter with Shildon's legendary Alf 'Wacker' Wild, a defender of such belligerence that to this day those who saw him play wince and clutch their shins at the very mention of his name. \"I was 17 and nippy as a whippet,\" the old man said. \"I pushed the ball past Alf Wild, zipped by him and banged over a cross.\" A few seconds later, he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Wacker. \"If you do that to me again, son,\" Wild said, in a kind and paternal manner, \"I'm afraid I'll have to break one of your legs.\" When he was 20, the retired engineer signed for a League club. I asked him what he had found different about playing professionally. \"It was good deal rougher,\" he said. What, I said, rougher than 'Wacker' Wild? \"Oh aye,\" he said, with a rueful smile. \"You see, the pros didn't bother with a warning.\" Something for James DeGale to bear in mind, I reckon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
