Federal, state and territory environment ministers meet on Friday in Adelaide, where they are due to announce a timetable to end the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. The prime minister has said he expected the ban to start next year. The Queensland government announced ahead of the meeting that it planned to ban the supply of many single-use plastics, including straws, stirrers, plates and cutlery. But groups representing the waste and recycling industry and the environment were pessimistic about the likelihood of a significant plan to deliver Morrison\u2019s headline commitment of an export ban, which has been backed by all premiers and chief ministers. Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association, said a draft plan shared with interest groups included no policies or funding to help develop a local industry to process what would no longer be exported. She said the industry and environment sector were united in concern over an apparent lack of action. In a letter to ministers, Sloan applauded the vision to boost domestic recycling capacity and end reliance on exports, but said the industry was dismayed little had been done to enable the shift. She said it wanted a \u201crobust action plan\u201d for use of recycled material backed by strong, enforceable targets and matched by funding from \u201call players in the supply chain\u201d, including packaging producers. It urged the states to press the federal government to explain how it would spend $130m committed to recycling at the election, and called on them to match it. \u201cIf we are going to make real change and not just set targets we can\u2019t meet or will only meet through perverse outcomes of increasing waste to landfill, then we have to have real support packages and sensible timeframes,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWe can do this, but not at zero cost and not with a few months\u2019 notice.\u201d Australia exports about 4.5m tonnes of waste to Asia each year, more than half of which is metal. Recycling companies have struggled to find new places to export waste since China introduced strict limits on the level of contaminated recycling material it would accept nearly two years ago. In Victoria, it culminated in recycling company SKM being put in administration and up to 180,000 tonnes of recyclable material potentially going to landfill. Compared with other developed economies, Australia generates more waste than average and recycles less. Announcing the proposed ban in August, Morrison expressed concern about the amount of plastic waste ending up in the ocean and cited data suggesting just 12% of Australian plastic waste was recycled. Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, said to dealing with the problem the ministers\u2019 meeting needed to make significant commitments on the procurement of recycled products, recycling content requirements and funding to kickstart the domestic industry. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this environment ministers\u2019 meeting to issue one of those usual vague, non-specific communiques,\u201d he said. In a video statement, the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the meeting would set a timetable for the ban, as promised. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make it happen,\u201d she said. But she said it would not be achieved through \u201cgovernment grants and too much regulation\u201d. \u201cThe sector is full of really smart people, they\u2019re doing this already, they need some help to scale up and I\u2019m always interested in how we can do that,\u201d she said. Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, the Victorian minister, said the country needed \u201can urgent national plan to fund this ban so we\u2019re ready when it comes in\u201d. She said the state was investing $135m and called for a rapid injection of federal funding. Other ministers approached declined to comment on how the ban would be implemented or did not respond. In Queensland, the environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said she wanted to introduce laws next year to ban many single-use plastics, with the possibility it could be extended to cups and heavyweight shopping bags. Enoch said the state\u2019s \u201cplastic pollution reduction plan\u201d was an Australian first in scope and structure and would encourage a shift to a circular economy that minimised waste and boosted recycling. She said any legislation would be the subject of widespread consultation and flagged exemptions for the disability and aged care sectors if suitable replacement products were not available. WWF-Australia\u2019s Katinka Day said if the Queensland plan was implemented the state would become the national leader in tackling single-use plastics, and called on other jurisdictions to follow. She said a major challenge would be dealing with inefficiencies in the waste management system that led to up to 130,000 tonnes of plastic entering local waterways and oceans each year. The environment ministers\u2019 meeting is also expected to reach a decision on a delayed national nature strategy meant to cover the years 2018 to 2030. A 17-page draft \u201cstrategy for nature\u201d was posted on the web just before Christmas 2017, replacing the previous 100-page biodiversity conservation strategy. It outlined three goals and 12 objectives but few details about what state and federal governments would do to meet them, and no measurable targets. The Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation urged Ley to use the meeting to secure an agreement on a national plan to address a spiralling extinction crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
