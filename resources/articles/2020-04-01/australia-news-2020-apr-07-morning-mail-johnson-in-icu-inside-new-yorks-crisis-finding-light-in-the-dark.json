Coronavirus The UK prime minister Boris Johnson has been moved into intensive care after spending a night in hospital due to persistent Covid-19 symptoms. \u201cOver the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital,\u201d said a Downing Street spokesperson. While Johnson is not known to have any underlying health conditions, he has been open about his struggle with obesity \u2013 a known risk factor for coronavirus. Dan Sabbagh and Rowena Mason write about the UK government\u2019s repeated denials that Johnson\u2019s condition was deteriorating. In the strange lead-up to Johnson\u2019s admission to ICU, rumours flew around Westminster as aides were emphatic that his symptoms were not serious. Follow the latest developments live. A Guardian Essential poll released this morning shows Scott Morrison\u2019s approval has been boosted by his management of the Covid-19 response. With the government deploying interventionist measures that would usually be the antithesis of the Liberals\u2019 political approach, it seems that Morrison has also picked up the support of Labor and Green voters.

Meanwhile, Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a pandemic modelling expert, says Australian cases could drop to zero by July \u2013 but only if the country can record 90% compliance with social distancing rules. Australia\u2019s death toll is now 41. There was good news in Italy, as the country recorded its lowest daily rise in infections \u2013 1,941 \u2013 the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March. For the third day in a row, there was a decrease in the number of intensive care beds in use. Falling numbers in Europe may offer some hope to the US, which is about to enter the \u201cpeak of a terrible pandemic\u201d. With the country\u2019s death toll now over 10,000, New York governor Andrew Cuomo warned that his state may also be reaching an apex. \u201cIf we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a very high level. Staying at this level is problematic,\u201d he said. New York has now confirmed 130,869 cases of coronavirus and recorded 4,758 deaths.

The US president has touted several drugs as being potential cures, most famously the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, of which he said \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d Oliver Milman looks into the drug and explains why we shouldn\u2019t believe the hype.
