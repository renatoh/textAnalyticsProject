It was no revolution: it was a coup staged by young army officers. And so it has been with a series of \"revolutions\" around the Arab world in which a succession of military men went on to lead us in civilian clothes \u2013 some kept the olive drabs on \u2013 and rob generations of the real meaning of revolution. For years I looked at the Iranians with envy \u2013 not at the outcome of their 1979 revolution, but because it was a popular uprising, not a euphemism for a coup. So you'll understand why, along with millions of other Arabs, I'll forever cherish 14 January 2011 \u2013 the day Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali fled Tunisia, his 23-year rule toppled by 29 days of a popular uprising. A real revolution for a change. It's the first time Arabs have toppled one of their dictators, so you'll understand why, despite the reports of chaos, looting and a musical chairs of caretaker leaders, I'm still celebrating. Let's have no whining about how those pesky Tunisians who risked their lives in their thousands to face down a despot ruined the idyllic package-holiday-in-a-police-state for so many European tourists. The equations circling Tunisia right now are very clear: we have no idea who or what kind of coalition of leaders will emerge but there is no doubt who's rooting for the failure of this revolution: every Arab leader who has spent the past month watching Tunisia in fear. You can be sure the region's dictators are on their knees right now praying for chaos and collapse for Tunisia. Some Arab countries have simply ignored what happened: no official statement from Algeria or Morocco. Others said they respect the wish of Tunisians but filled their state-owned media with reminders that they weren't anything like Tunisia: Egypt. Leave it to Muammar Gaddafi, the world's longest-serving dictator, to best portray that panic. Addressing a nation where thousands had faced down the bullets of Ben Ali's security to protest at unemployment, police brutality and the corruption of the regime, Gaddafi told Tunisians they were now suffering bloodshed and lawlessness because they were too hasty in getting rid of Ben Ali. If every Arab leader has watched Tunisia in fear, then every Arab citizen has watched in hope because it was neither Islamists \u2013 long used by our leaders to scare many into acquiescence \u2013 nor foreign troops that toppled the dictator: it was ordinary and very fed up people. Tunisians must remember that during these days of chaos. We're hearing reports that neighbourhood watch committees have sprung up to protect against looting and violence, which many blame on Ben Ali's loyalists. Interestingly, both western observers and Gaddafi have been crediting WikiLeaks, but for different reasons. By buying into the idea that leaked US embassy cables about corruption \"fuelled\" the revolution, commentators smear Tunisians with ignorance of facts and perpetuate the myth that Arabs are incapable of rising up against dictators. Gaddafi railed against WikiLeaks because he, too, wants to blame something other than the power of the people \u2013 and cables from Tripoli portray him as a Botox-using neurotic inseparable from a \"voluptuous\" Ukrainian nurse. Gaddafi's Libya has had its own protests over the past few days. Nothing on the scale of Tunisia, but enough that his speech to Tunisians could be summarised thus: I am scared witless by what happened in your country. That's why I insist we stop and appreciate Tunisia: relish the revolution that is no longer a euphemism for a coup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
