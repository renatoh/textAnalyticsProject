Travel companies have responded to the weakest dollar rate in more than a decade (nudging $2 to the pound) by cutting holiday prices by as much as a third. Booking directly with hotels also gives you deals. For example, the Fairmont Royal Pavilion in Barbados (020 7025 1625) has a room rate of $659. Booking it last August would have cost \u00a3418 but booking it with today's exchange rate would cost just \u00a3357, a \u00a361 saving. Some companies are trying to entice us with added value rather than cut prices - for instance www.holiday-rentals.com, which has several self-catering properties in the Caribbean, is including free 4x4 car rental. Below, we list the best cut-price offers for travel in February and March. Unless otherwise stated, prices are per person for seven night breaks and are based on two people sharing. Antigua A great one for beach babes; situated in a majestic position on a headland and bluff, Curtain Bluff has the advantage of being between two distinctive beaches, one calm and one surf.

All of the 72 rooms decked out in colonial style have an ocean view, with either a balcony or garden patio.

St Barts It's tiny, it's France in the sunshine and it's the exclusive destination sought after by the likes of Mariah Carey, Puff Daddy and Beyonc\u00e9, right, but St Barts is now more affordable.
