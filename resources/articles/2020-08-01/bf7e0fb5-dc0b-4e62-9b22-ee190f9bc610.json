As Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes, prepared her team for the revival of their rivalry with Manchester City, she hailed the influx of top international players from the US to England, and to her opponents, as a \u201cdream scenario\u201d. \u201cYeah, wow,\u201d said Hayes when asked about Manchester City\u2019s signings. \u201cThey spent a tremendous amount of money, bringing in some unbelievable players. \u201cI\u2019m sure their fanbase will expect really big things from them and that\u2019s understandable because they are already a very good team that have now improved what they\u2019re doing to an even higher level.\u201d Those hoping to make their debuts for Manchester City on Saturday include the US World Cup winners Rose Lavelle and Samantha Mewis. Elsewhere, Arsenal have enlisted the talents of the Australians Steph Cately, Caitlin Foord and Lydia Williams. Chelsea set the tone in November with their purchase of the Australia forward Sam Kerr. Rather than any one side breaking through, Hayes believes that the teams are pushing each other to new levels. \u201cI expect that the competition between us will not change \u2013 it\u2019s always neck-and-neck and I\u2019m just so excited to see all this top talent come to the UK,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cIt will improve all of our players and games will be even closer because of the quality on show. This is what I wanted for the league. This is, for me, a dream scenario.\u201d Such a distinguished return \u2013 the two best teams in England broadcast on BBC One from Wembley \u2013 presents a significant moment for the women\u2019s game after a summer of unease about the effect of coronavirus on women\u2019s sports. Although Hayes is against double headers in normal times with crowds, she noted the strong decision-making of the FA and she expects it to become a regular fixture. \u201cTo think that [the Community Shield] hasn\u2019t been in place seems very strange, but to bring it back at a time when people least expect it, I think is a great move because if we have the competition on the men\u2019s side, we should have it on the women\u2019s side,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re both playing on the same day with no fans is a really great idea and one of the benefits of broadcasting differently during Covid and one where we can maximise interest in the women\u2019s game and start the season as we mean to go on.\u201d The rivalry between Chelsea and Manchester City was already the biggest in the league and it will resume bolstered by recent events. The 2019-20 Women\u2019s Super League was decided by the virus as an unbeaten Chelsea were awarded the title league by 0.1 points per game, an outcome that left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Manchester City players. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit weird when you see that number,\u201d said Steph Houghton. \u201cFor us as a team it was hard to take but, at the same time, it\u2019s probably given us a bit more motivation for this season coming. The main thing was everyone was fit and healthy over the Covid pandemic. But it\u2019s more about us being extra motivated to hopefully finish top at the end of this season.\u201d The rivalry was intense enough last season as Chelsea won their home game in November 2-1, then the final matchday before the pandemic brought a delirious 3-3 draw in February. Although the intensity may rise, cordiality will endure. \u201cWe don\u2019t hate Chelsea,\u201d said City\u2019s Georgia Stanway. \u201cWe know a lot of them internationally so we get on. We\u2019re women, we love spending time with each other and love football. It\u2019s exciting that they\u2019ve signed as many new players as we have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
