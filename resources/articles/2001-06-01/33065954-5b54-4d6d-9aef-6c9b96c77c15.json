Many attribute the low election turnout to the cynicism bred by slick marketing, which encourages a feeling that \"you can't trust any of them\". And the campaign once again saw the Millbank machine attempting to exert a stranglehold over the media, feeding favoured outlets such as the Sun while denying the Today programme the chance to quiz ministers who were about to be sacked or in danger of going off-message. Chris Smith and Clare Short were notable by their absence. All of which could explain why government plans about to be unveiled could spell the end for spin doctors as we've come to know and loathe them. Within weeks, the Cabinet Office will reveal new contracts in which the rules governing special advisers' relationships with the press will be set down in black and white. This means that contacts between journalists and spin doctors will have to obey the restrictions of this code, and those who fall foul of it could face dismissal. Whether this will be successful remains to be seen. Within the lobby at Westminster - where ministers' aides can be a lifeline, offering insights into what's going on behind the scenes and the future agenda - the general feeling is that the idea is almost laughable, and will make no practical difference at all. \"It's a silly attempt by the government to deflect the criticism that they are more spin than substance,\" scoffed one hack. The proposed contracts certainly aren't causing any lack of sleep at the Sun. \"The relationship between journalists and spin doctors is part and parcel of politics, and I don't think there is any need to curb them,\" says the paper's deputy political editor George Pascoe-Watson. \"Everyone has to play by the rules of the game, and bringing in rules to define that relationship is just not possible. We speak to them all the time, and we rely on them far more than on any civil servant.\" Charlie Whelan, who narrates a Radio 4 programme on the subject tonight, predictably believes the contract idea is \"100% bollocks\". \"It's spin about spin. It's a half-baked idea of some civil servant who has no idea how these things work.\" Some see the planned contracts as an attempt to give the special advisers a more acceptable face, and to distance them from the bullying image epitomised by Whelan during his reign as Gordon Brown's spokesman. As one commentator puts it, the general perception is that \"Whelan never really understood the subtleties of government.\" Unease has been growing that those briefing journalists have been overstepping the mark, straying from presentation into policy. Alastair Campbell's praise for Star Wars II and his deriding of \"bog standard\" comprehensives showed that their role can now far exceed that of just being their master's voice. Yet how the new rules will define acceptable conduct is still unclear. And is there any need for a code anyway? Adam Boulton, Sky News' political editor, sees possible advantages in \"legitimising\" advisers' roles. \"There is a perceived problem that spin doctors have got out of control, and that has been used by the Conservatives against the government. As there are more special advisers than ever before, who are paid for out of tax payers' money, there is an argument that it is right and proper that their role is acknowledged and legitimised. In that respect, this new contract will be significant as a point of no return in recognising the scale of their effect.\" Despite the problems spin doctors caused him in the election campaign, Today editor Rod Liddle disagrees, arguing that their efforts tend to be counterproductive and serve to make his team more scrupulous: \"When they try to exert too much control it just makes journalists resentful and paranoid, and makes them dig much harder. It also means that we exaggerate, sometimes wildly so, whenever there is the tiniest of slips in presentation.\" And contrary to their all-controlling reputation, spin doctors have a handy habit of letting cats out of bags: \"They're there to have direct contact with journalists and by and large they let something slip, they can't help themselves. Most spin doctors aren't very good at their job, they're always giving things away. Alastair Campbell's briefings, phone calls and letters reveal far more than if he had just kept his mouth shut.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
