In fact, Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell acted for Enterprise on the transaction. Apologies. Shell was plunged into further controversy last night when it emerged that \"independent\" investigators looking into how it lost 20% of its proven reserves all had close links with the group. The news came 24 hours after the world's second largest publicly listed oil major forced chairman Sir Philip Watts and his right-hand man to quit. Shares in the group closed down 2.5p to 381p after investors' reactions turned from relief about Sir Philip's departure to concern about what might happen next. The reserves review is being organised by the group audit committee headed by non-executive director Sir Peter Burt, the new ITV chairman, and five of his colleagues. Shell said it had further increased the independence of the investigation by hiring New York law firm Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell. But the website of the London arm of the firm boasts that its partners worked for Shell on the $6.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) takeover of Enterprise Oil. Shell also admitted that both former and present company employees were working with Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell and would report back \"within weeks\" to Sir Peter, Nina Henderson and the other non-executives. Energy analysts reacted with astonishment to the latest revelations, saying they would add to the belief that Shell was not on top of the situation and that more bad news might come out. \"This gives you zero confidence and makes you feel that Shell is like a supertanker without a propeller, going round and round,\" said Bruce Evers, an oil analyst at Investec Securities. \"What you need for the review is a clean, fair and independent look at what went wrong,\" said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &amp; Co brokerage in New York. \"You have to get people with no ties or vested interests in Shell. Using non-executives and former staff makes it look like the old boy network. This will not give a high degree of confidence to shareholders, who are already very nervous.\" Shell said the results of the review would be shared with US regulator the securities and exchange commission and other authorities. The oil group said on Wednesday that Sir Philip and head of exploration Walter van de Vijver were asked to go because of \"facts and circumstances\" surrounding the inquiry into how 3.9bn barrels of reserves had to be cut. Shell has upset investors by making changes to its story. This continued yesterday when it said Malcolm Brinded would act only temporarily as head of exploration and gas and power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
