RUNNER-UP Swansea's Michu: refused to let his 580-minute goal drought get him down, and instead just waited for the QPR home game to come round. Problem solved. GOAL OF THE DAY Chelsea's Ramires: one touch to control it, and one to clip it past Ali al-Habsi. MOST CARING GESTURE Gareth Barry: taking the focus off Joe Hart's ball-fumbling gaffe by slotting an even better slide-rule own goal past him. BEST/WORST CELEBRATION Jason Puncheon marked his strike against City with a unique bottom-wiping mime: a nod to last month's televised toilet break against Everton. CHAIRMAN OF THE DAY Mansfield's John Radford thanked manager Paul Cox for their 8-1 mauling of Barrow by giving him his Aston Martin. REACTION OF THE DAY Norwich's scoreboard, responding to the tedium at Carrow Road by losing interest and going blank. The game's most noteworthy incident. TWITS OF THE DAY Things we hate about modern football No1,457,876, courtesy of Melbourne Heart \u2013 who replaced the names on their players' shirts with their Twitter handles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
