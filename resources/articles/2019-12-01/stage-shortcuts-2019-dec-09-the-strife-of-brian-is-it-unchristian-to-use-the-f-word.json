Shocked audience members rushed to help, but it turned out that the 83-year-old actor had suffered only a grazed knee. Worse damage had been done to the sacred atmosphere, which still echoed from the loudest voice in showbusiness yelling \u201cFuck!\u201d into the interior of St Giles-in-the-Fields. This sort of swearing isn\u2019t very Christmassy behaviour, but is it actually unchristian? While grazing his knee, Blessed did have the presence of mind not to \u201ctake the name of the Lord thy God in vain\u201d, as prohibited by the second commandment. In the Sermon on the Mount, on the other hand, Jesus says: \u201cAnyone who says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be in danger of the fire of hell.\u201d It is hard not to feel that Blessed went a little further than that. Sadly, the Bible does not include an alphabetised list of all the worst swearwords and their associated punishments. But on the basis of what the Bible does say, is it wrong to shout \u201cfuck\u201d in a crowded church? \u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d says Ian Paul, a theologian and minister at St Nic\u2019s, Nottingham. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral transgression because it exhibits a lack of self-control.\u201d For reference, Paul points to Galatians 5:22, in which St Paul extols the \u201cself-control\u201d of the spirit in its battle against the fleshly urges, which otherwise lead towards \u201csexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like\u201d. As far as we know, Blessed has always shown exemplary self-control in most of these areas, but perhaps \u201cfits of rage\u201d needs work. Paul also says that even secular swearing is wrong \u201cbecause it is rooted in a structure of behaviour of wanting to undermine social mores, and it will cause some people offence\u201d. In this respect, Blessed looks guilty as charged. Although swearing in private, or quietly, if he can manage that, might be less serious. \u201cI must admit, if I bang my head and I use the s-word, it is always on my own,\u201d says Paul."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
