The case against British-born Omar Saeed Sheikh was adjourned for a week after his lawyers asked the prosecution to hand over copies of some of the most crucial evidence. Pakistan's military regime banned journalists from covering the case and allowed only a handful of relatives, including Mr Sheikh's father, to attend the hearing. Pearl, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal, went missing in Karachi in January while researching a story into militant Islam and al-Qaida's links in Pakistan. Emails containing photographs of the journalist in chains and with a gun to his head were sent to several American news organisations. A month later a videotape surfaced which showed Pearl being decapitated. His body has never been found. Mr Sheikh, 29, and his three co-defendants are charged with murder, kidnapping and terrorism and face the death penalty if convicted. Pakistani authorities issued arrest warrants yesterday for seven more suspects in the case. One of the defendants, Salman Saqib, complained to the judge that he had been tortured and beaten by police officers during the investigation, his lawyer, Khawaja Naveed Ahmed said after the hearing. The judge agreed to let a doctor see him. Mr Sheikh, who went to a British public school and dropped out of the London School of Economics, is suspected of masterminding the kidnapping. In a pre-trial hearing he openly told the court he had kid napped Pearl. Mr Sheikh has also been indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States and has been charged in a sealed indictment with an earlier kidnapping of four tourists in India in 1994. But Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, is unlikely to allow the US to extradite Mr Sheikh before he has been dealt with by the Pakistani courts. Meanwhile, US officials said yesterday that al-Qaida and Taliban forces were distributing pamphlets in Afghanistan which offered rewards for dead or captured westerners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
