It was 2014, and Mira Jacob\u2019s six-year-old son Z had moved on from being obsessed with Freddie Mercury (\u201cHe demanded fake moustaches for a solid year\u201d), to being obsessed with Jackson. He knew all the moves and was never without a fedora. \u201cSo my husband and I, thinking we were geniuses, got him all the albums,\u201d Jacob explains. \u201cThe problem is, when you give a mixed-race kid albums from the trajectory of Michael Jackson\u2019s career, he gets really puzzled.\u201d And so the questions started: What colour was Jackson? How did he turn white? Why did he want to turn white? \u201cThe funny part was that Z didn\u2019t even know at that point what colour he was himself,\u201d Jacob says. \u201cHe would say things like, \u2018You\u2019re brown! Daddy\u2019s white!\u2019\u201d Around the same time, Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Z started connecting the dots and \u201casking whether that\u2019s why someone would turn white \u2013 so that what happened in Ferguson doesn\u2019t happen to them? I could see it forming in his head,\u201d says Jacob: \u201c\u2018Is it not OK to be a brown person?\u2019; \u2018What is this that\u2019s happening?\u2019 Those questions are really hard to answer when Trump is rising and it\u2019s clearly not OK to be a brown person.\u201d Over the next few years, Z\u2019s questions, and Jacob\u2019s answers, turned into a graphic journal, Good Talk: A Memoir In Conversations. Z\u2019s questions growing up as a half-Jewish, half-Indian, all-American kid in Brooklyn are interspersed with Jacob\u2019s experience growing up in New Mexico, the daughter of Indian immigrants. When Jacob first pitched the book to publishers in 2015, she imagined it would be a lot funnier (although it is still a funny book). \u201cI thought the clear arc was that things are getting very tense right now but we are going to come out of this moment.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t happen. Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cSo when America changed, the book changed. \u201cFor years I had been telling myself that America was changing for the better, and that the pain and confusion I\u2019d felt growing up here would soon be a thing of the past,\u201d Jacob writes at the beginning of Good Talk. \u201cNow every question Z asked me made me realise the growing gap between the America I\u2019d been raised to believe in and the one rising fast all around us.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say, of course, that America hasn\u2019t changed for the better in many ways. It\u2019s worth remembering that interracial marriage was still illegal as recently as 50 years ago. Now families like Jacob\u2019s are increasingly common. \u201cSo Z doesn\u2019t feel singled out. But I think he thinks the president doesn\u2019t like kids who look like him. That\u2019s a complicated thing to figure out.\u201d Also complicated is trying to strike a balance between protecting your brown son from a world in which he won\u2019t always be welcome, and preparing him for it. \u201cThat is the question of the decade \u2013 and I don\u2019t have a great answer, other than I try to answer the question I\u2019m asked and not the pile of things I am anxious about in my head. \u201cPlenty of our parent friends have teenage black and brown sons, and have had to prepare them for stop-and-frisk incidents. So when Z asked me about Ferguson, I started thinking about that. My brain wants to tell him, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the thing you\u2019re going to need to know for the next 10 years of your life.\u2019 Then I have to stop myself and say, he doesn\u2019t need to know that yet.\u201d There are moments of brightness, however. Jacob remembers that one day, when Z was reeling from watching the news, she suggested they watch a Netflix special by the Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu. \u201cWe watched it [and Z] was laughing so hard, and getting this idea \u2013 which I never had growing up \u2013 that Indians are cool. \u2018Look how cool this guy is! This guy is so funny!\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Oh, thank you Hari Kondabolu \u2013 you have saved us today.\u2019\u201d How do you strike a balance between protecting a curious, news-loving child from what is happening in the world, while keeping them educated and informed? It\u2019s difficult. Jacob has resorted to turning off the news a lot lately, in an attempt to keep some of the ugliness out. But it\u2019s not always possible. In 2017, white nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, among other things: \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d Jacob remembers Z turning away from the TV and asking: \u201cIs it bad to be brown and Jewish because those are two things no one likes?\u201d \u201cAt that moment, my heart is pounding for my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m furious and terrified. Whenever I\u2019m that scared, I feel like my parental reaction is to throw myself to a very calm place so I\u2019m not projecting the anxiety I feel.\u201d Do people ever tell Z race doesn\u2019t matter? \u201cOf course. Yeah, the entire white side of the family would say that to him. It\u2019s always interesting when people who never experience something say it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s sort of like saying: \u2018Your experience, whatever you might be feeling, just doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 The line that I\u2019ve kind of stuck to with him is: all of your white family, even when they say these baffling things, they do love you. They might not always know the right thing to say, and they might say things that upset you sometimes, and you should tell them.\u201d In recent years, politics has become increasingly personal on both sides of the Atlantic. Jacob\u2019s in-laws supported Trump, but wouldn\u2019t broach the subject with her, thinking it was better not to talk about it. \u201cAnd I thought, well, that\u2019s very convenient for you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like my skin is coming off every time I walk into this house.\u201d It\u2019s hard, because of course Jacob loves her in-laws and they love her. \u201c[But] this isn\u2019t about love. I think that\u2019s the part that\u2019s hardest for them to understand. When they talk to me they say, \u2018We want you to know we love you.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I know that. You are wonderful to me on many levels. You are also ignoring this thing which is terrifying and true. You are making the country less safe for me and my son. There\u2019s no amount of you loving me that changes that.\u2019\u201d People sometimes tell Jacob that her in-laws wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump if they really loved her; she finds that idea deeply frustrating. \u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification. They are oversimplifying my life to console themselves \u2013 to give themselves the idea that people who love each other don\u2019t hurt each other. That is a ridiculous lie. People who love each other hurt each other all the time. Now what?\u201d Jacob\u2019s answer to that question is to talk. To try to have an honest and open conversation with her whole family, no matter how hard it may be. \u201cFor me \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t prescribe this for anyone else \u2013 having a conversation, despite this enormous hurt, feels like the single biggest act of resistance I can perform.\u201d \u2022 Good Talk: A Memoir In Conversations is out now, published by Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99.
