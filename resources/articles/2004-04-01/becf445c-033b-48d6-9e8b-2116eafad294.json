That was the inconclusive conclusion today following a short meeting at Lord's between the England and Wales Cricket Board management and their Zimbabwean counterparts. Both sets of officials came out speaking of a \"useful, cordial\" meeting but of nothing more specific. ECB director of corporate affairs John Read described his employers' position as \"most invidious\" as they grapple with a welter of public opinion against the tour and the threat of huge financial penalties and suspension from the world game. Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka emerged from the meeting, meanwhile, to stress the extreme importance to his country's cricket of successful tours and also that the safety of the visitors can be guaranteed. Read identified the next stage in the saga of whether England will tour as a meeting between the ECB and the Government's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell on May 4 But he gave no indication that a decision could be announced even then. \"That meeting is coming up, and we will just have to see what happens,\" he said \"But even if we are able to make a decision in six weeks' time we must retain the caveat that there is a possibility we may have to think again if the situation in Zimbabwe worsens significantly.\" In the absence of an unequivocal \"instruction\" from Government not to visit a country beset by human-rights abuses under Robert Mugabe's disgraced regime, the ECB know the only way they can avoid debilitating sanctions from the International Cricket Council is to successfully cite security concerns - rather than moral issues - as their reason for staying away. New ICC regulations stipulate the possibility of a $2m fine and one-year suspension from world cricket for any country which chooses not to fulfil its playing commitments without a just cause, as identified by world cricket bosses' criteria. Read fears that scenario would have a crippling knock-on effect on English cricket - and he estimates the overall cost at \u00a350m. \"We are not football - no other sport is - and \u00a350m is an awful lot of money which could hurt us very badly,\" said Read. \"Ninety per cent of our revenue comes from the international game, and 90% is about \u00a350m. \"That would drastically affect all parts and levels of the game from the Test team down to the grass roots.\" Read admits that the ECB have \"no reason to disbelieve\" today's assurances from Chingoka and his ZCU colleague Ozias Bvute that safety will be paramount in Zimbabwe. Chingoka was at pains to reassure his prospective autumn guests. \"All recent tours have had very good reports. They have proved very successful and safe trips. \"There is no question of security problems, and you are most welcome to come to Zimbabwe to discover that for yourselves.\" Chingoka added the ZCU hope England will commit soon to go ahead with a tour which is so important for Zimbabwe cricket. \"International cricket boards earn the majority of their income from hosting inbound tours, so it is vital for cricket in Zimbabwe that overseas teams continue to visit our country,\" he said. \"Today was an important opportunity for the ZCU to communicate directly to the people who will make a final decision on the tour. \"International cricket relies heavily on the goodwill that exists between boards in maintaining the integrity of the ICC Future Tours Programme. Zimbabwe showed that faith by visiting the UK last summer, and we are confident that England will reciprocate by confirming their tour. We look forward to an early and positive decision by the ECB.\" Chingoka and Bvute met earlier today with international players' union representative Richard Bevan and were due to speak tonight with ICC president Ehsan Mani and chief executive Malcolm Speed about the crisis which has led to 15 white players refusing to play for Zimbabwe. Deposed captain Heath Streak and several other high-profile Zimbabwe cricketers are among that number, leaving their country to field a vastly under-strength team. Chingoka has made it clear, though, that he remains willing to talk to the 15 contracted players involved in the dispute with the ZCU. The door remains open to the players and their representatives to talk to the union in an attempt to find a solution to the very serious problems we are currently facing,\" he said. \"Contrary to some media reports, the ZCU has no agenda to drive white players out of the game in Zimbabwe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
