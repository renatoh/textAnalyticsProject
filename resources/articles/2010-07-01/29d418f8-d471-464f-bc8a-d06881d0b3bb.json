Gove told the House of Commons he was \"deeply sceptical\" of the purpose of the General Teaching Council for England (GTC) and believed it \"did little to raise teaching standards or professionalism\". What a pity he did not seek the facts. I am co-chair of the Public and Commercial Services Union at the GTC. Gove should have been aware that the GTC has identified over 10,000 people who were teaching but not qualified, and has taken action to facilitate their removal from classrooms. We are still called upon by employers to clarify overseas-trained teachers' professional qualifications, and we contact headteachers to inform them if one of their staff is not suitably qualified. We have investigated more than 4,000 cases, and over 1,000 of them have been, or are being, passed to a public hearing. We have dealt with cases that involve manslaughter; drug abuse and supply; failure to apply child protection policies (in one case an individual was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for child abuse and rape within the school); possession of firearms; fraud; prostitution; and accessing hardcore pornography on school equipment. The GTC has amassed the largest database of registered teachers in the world \u2013 a database it uses to send annual patterns in the teacher workforce to local and national education organisations to help them with recruitment. Yet Gove says we have done \"little to raise teaching standards or professionalism\"? I think not. You report Gove's criticism of a decision by a GTC disciplinary panel in the case of BNP activist Adam Walker. But he should not judge an entire organisation on one case. Abolishing the current organisation only to replace it with a new one will not live up to Gove's promises to save money \u2013 given the cost of unemployment, redundancy payments, loss of taxes and any new startup. But then, on making the announcement, he could not pin down how much would be saved, or how much the rebranding of his own department has cost. Perhaps we should all be grateful that Gove got the Department for Education and not the Treasury. The worst-case scenario would be to devolve powers to individual schools, moving towards the kind of compartmentalised system of information-gathering that allowed the tragedy in Soham. How will Gove ensure that standards are applied consistently and that loopholes do not appear that could be exploited by those unsuitable to be around children? If I was a parent, having seen what has passed over my desk in the last seven years, I'd be very worried about what was to come and how safe a classroom for my child would be. That is something every parent should be asking themselves today, and then asking their MP tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
