The underspend, confirmed by the Commons public accounts committee yesterday, represents a rapid turnaround in health finances: three years ago, the organisation recorded a \u00a3500m deficit. The exceptional figures delivered under the current health secretary, Alan Johnson, are in contrast to the experience of his predecessor, Patricia Hewitt, who was slow handclapped at a nurses' conference during a debate about NHS debt. Large reserves, however, constitute a different form of political embarrassment. \"It's not the case that the bigger a surplus the better,\" said Edward Leigh, chairman of the PAC. \"Patients lose out if too much NHS funding is sitting unspent in bank accounts. \"The needs here and now of patients in parts of the country for drugs and better quality care must not be forgotten. [The surplus is] almost twice the amount planned and over \u00a31bn more than the surplus generated in the previous year.\" Janet Davies, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"A \u00a31.7bn surplus is \u00a31.7bn which must be spent on improving patient care and the government must make clear how it plans to use this money. \"While we are encouraged that the NHS is on a firm financial footing, it is absolutely vital that this surplus goes straight to frontline services.\" The \u00a31.7bn represents almost 2% of annual NHS expenditure, the PAC report says. The cash came from a number of sources, including a fall in the price of generic medicines and the underuse of contingency funds. Savings were also made by changing the habit of trusts spending all of their budget at the end of each year \"regardless of whether it [was] in the most appropriate fashion\". The NHS is forecasting that it will return a similar surplus in the year 2008-09. The Department of Health will return part of the unspent funds to the NHS at an annual rate of \u00a3400m for the next two years, providing cushioning for the economic downturn. The NHS is receiving above-average annual budget increases of 5.5% up to and including 2010\u201311. Some trusts, the committee notes, spent cash in an \"inappropriate manner\" for fear of losing it. About \u00a3280m was given by primary care trusts to NHS foundations \"where no service had been received [but] in anticipation of future services\". Despite the overall surplus a small proportion of NHS trusts and organisations - a total of 11 - recorded deficits in the year 2007-08; most were in the south-east. Barking, Havering and Redbridge hospitals trust was worst with a \u00a335m overspend. One immediate threat looming over balance sheets is a change in accounting procedures which will add in \u00a310.9bn of liabilities from the government's public finance initiatives. \"The Treasury has given a commitment that this will not adversely affect NHS funding in the period up to 31 March 2011,\" the PAC said. \"There are, however, no guarantees beyond that point.\" The King's Fund, which monitors NHS performance, said: \"'Delivering a \u00a31.7bn underspend in a \u00a3100bn service is not ideal but we should remember that only three or four years ago the NHS was overspending and in serious financial trouble. \"The finances of the health service are now in much better shape and this will be crucial, given the NHS will have to prepare at best for very low or zero growth in funding from 2011 onwards.\" Another report today claimed that NHS hospitals are subsidising treatment for private patients because they fail to charge the full costs of care. The study compared what NHS hospitals charge patients for treatment with hospitals' own breakdown of what it costs them to provide the treatment. Thirty per cent of patients were charged less than the hospital said their treatment cost, according to a survey by the Health Service Journal. The subsidy is equivalent to \u00a399 for each private patient and approximately \u00a31.7m if replicated across all acute trusts. The NHS chief executive, David Nicholson, yesterday said the organisation would have to prepare for leaner times in the future. The organisation is expected to deliver efficiency savings in the order of \u00a315bn over the three years after 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
