Under the government\u2019s proposal, a state or territory supreme court will decide if a high-risk offender remains high risk at the end of their sentence. For a high-risk prisoner to be kept in jail, the court must be satisfied that no other less restrictive measure would be effective in preventing \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d to community safety. The maximum period for which a continuing detention order can be made is three years and the person must not be detained in the same area as the general prison population . Human rights groups will present their submissions to an inquiry into the proposed criminal code amendment (high risk terrorist offenders) bill 2016 during hearings in Canberra on Friday. In one of the written submissions, Prof Ben Saul, Challis chair of international law at the University of Sydney said the scheme violates Australia\u2019s international human rights obligations by characterising continued incarceration as preventative detention. \u201cPrisons are built for prisoners, not non-prisoners \u2026 I am not aware of prison facilities where a person subject to a continuing detention order could be meaningfully separated from, and treated differently than, prisoners,\u201d he said in his statement. Human Rights Watch said in its submission there was ambiguity around what constituted \u201chigh risk\u201d. Terrorism legislation provides for up to 15 years imprisonment for non-violent offences including possessing a \u201cthing\u201d, providing material and resources, or having membership related to a terrorist group. \u201cAustralian law\u2019s overly broad definition of terrorism makes the bill particularly worrisome,\u201d the group said in their submission. Human Rights Watch said existing laws already provided for control orders that allowed tracking and surveillance of suspects. The Muslim Legal Network said in its submission the proposed scheme breached human rights obligations by providing for potentially indefinite, arbitrary and punitively retroactive punishment. Zaahir Edries, president of the Muslim Legal Network, said the measures effectively added a criminal sanction to a prisoner\u2019s sentence without the benefit of a trial. \u201cProposing this kind of legislation where there are minimal safeguards and the standards are lowered to prove them poses a dangerous and unacceptable infringement on civil liberties,\u201d he said. The Lebanese Muslim Association\u2019s submission said the government\u2019s proposed measures were counterproductive and risked creating \u201cmartyrs\u201d out of those incarcerated while further alienating Muslim youth. The office of the attorney general, George Brandis, has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
