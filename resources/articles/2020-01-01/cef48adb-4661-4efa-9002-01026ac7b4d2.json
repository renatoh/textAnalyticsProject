Top stories The bushfire crisis is the latest in a string of bad news for the Australian economy, according to Deloitte Access Economics, sapping consumer confidence along with the downturn in housing construction and prolonged drought. In the latest business outlook report, released on Monday, Deloitte partly blames the Reserve Bank for its communication of the reasons driving rate cuts and warns that poor consumer and business confidence \u201crisks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy\u201d. The report cites downturns in the retail, construction and finance sectors as cause for concern but notes that healthcare, education and the public sector are growing. The government rejected several offers from Eastern Australia Agriculture over the past decade to sell its overland-flow water rights because the deals were \u201cnot value for money\u201d, before paying $80m for the same rights, new documents show.

The program is incredible, and within a term we\u2019ve started seeing results. And we\u2019re paying an arm and a leg for the opportunity. The education doesn\u2019t come cheap.
