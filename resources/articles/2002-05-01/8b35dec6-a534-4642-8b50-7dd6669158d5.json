The pompous invective from fellow journalists and bitchy columnists paled into insignificance compared with the stinging criticism of being called 'a bad mother' and the 'mother from hell'. I realised that you can get away with all sorts of outrageous behaviour in this life, but to be called 'a bad mother' is universally regarded as unforgivable and ranks you just below child-killers and paedophiles. The whole episode forced me to re-examine my relationship with my nine-year-old daughter very closely, and I came to the conclusion that I was no earth mother - and perhaps I didn't know her as well as I should. I didn't know her favourite colour, her favourite food or her favourite pop star. Happily, I can now tell you blue is the colour, cheese and tomato pizza is to die for and Kylie Minogue is cool. I have also discovered that Miss Daisy has a wicked sense of humour, is horribly indiscreet and will sell her soul for a stick of chewing gum. I discovered all of this and much, much more during a four-week 'adventure' in the company of Daisy, 24/7. We basked on Bondi Beach, shivered in an air-conditioned Dubai taxi, got drenched in torrential rain in Afghanistan and sweated in the stifling heat of Lahore. We indulged in five-star luxury, spent an unforgettable night in an Aussie youth hostel, kipped in a Kabul guest house and were terrorised in Pakistan by cockroaches big enough to carry their own pagers. We had an amazing time together but, more importantly, I have emerged from a wonderful bonding experience with a child I am very proud to call my daughter. However, it wasn't all sugar and spice. There were painful moments, frank exchanges, frayed tempers, tantrums and tears. When we set off for Sydney from Heathrow, I was bracing myself for a dreadful experience being cooped up in economy class with a fidgety kid. However, the Emirates flight (changing planes at Dubai and a short stopover in Singapore) was a joy, with plenty of leg room. On arrival in Sydney, we checked in to the five-star Le Meridien where the staff made us feel as though we were the only guests in the 415-bed European-style hotel. We were given a suite on the thirty-second floor and were immediately struck by the dramatic skyline. Positioned in the heart of the city, we were a short stroll from the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Yet we never left the hotel. Because we're both so busy, we rarely get much time to do nothing, and we thoroughly enjoyed doing nothing together. Our next stop in Sydney was the Observatory hotel, which turned out to be Daisy's favourite residence. It is magnificently kid-friendly, from the Nintendo Game Boys and Sony PlayStations in our room to mini-sized bathrobes, loanable goldfish and a personalised 'welcome' gingerbread decorated with chocolates and your child's name. She developed a taste for five-star luxury at this 100-room Orient-Express group hotel, recently voted the eleventh best in the world. Located in the Rocks district, it was within easy reach of all the main attractions. Daisy loved the 20-metre swimming pool which she used every day. Understated elegance was the hallmark. I would've loved to have dined in the Galileo restaurant, but the Italian-inspired menu made Daisy stick out her tongue and make one of those awful noises only kids can make. Instead we stuck to room service and, because she insisted, I went to bed at the same time as her. Every night was an early night. She even ordered me to refrain from drinking and smoking (Betty Ford would've been impressed). I conceded, and reasoned that it was probably in my best interests anyway - anything for an easy life. Having arrived in Oz three days earlier and not seen so much as a kangaroo, we forced ourselves to go for a walk and within minutes were standing below the Harbour Bridge. Tourists can climb across it but thankfully the minimum age was 12, so we went off to explore the harbour area. Although we both knew what the Opera House looked like, nothing prepared us for seeing 'the real thing'. After an afternoon visiting Taronga Zoo - called 'the zoo with a view' because of its position overlooking the city - we decided to move to Bondi Beach. It may have tacky shops but it's a great, fun place to be. My water babe headed straight for the sea from the nearby Swiss Grand Hotel. I also booked a two-day tour with Oz Trek Adventures for a reasonable A$108 (\u00a340) which took in the dramatic Wentworth Falls and horse trekking through the scenic Megalong Valley, stopping overnight at a youth hostel. Neither of us had stayed in a hostel before but I thought it would do us both good to mix with the rucksack-and-boots brigade. As we approached the Wentworth Falls it was raining stair rods and a swollen river had blocked the footpath. Taking another route, Daisy fearlessly led the way and laughed as the adults struggled to balance on slimy stepping stones and winding, muddy paths. The journey back from the falls took me 40 minutes, and by the time I reached the top, most of our party had gathered around Daisy who was amusing her new best friends with the tale of how her mother was caught by the Taliban - I was being exploited by my own daughter! It was time to go to the Katoomba YHA and she giggled as I expressed reservations about staying with all those beardy, backpacking types. 'I can't believe we have to make our own beds,' I whispered as we were handed sheets. I poked my head around the bedroom door and headed back to reception. 'There are some people asleep in our room,' I gasped. The receptionist said: 'This is what the YHA is all about. It's all about sharing.' Shocked, I replied: 'Well I want an upgrade. I can't share a room with strangers. I don't even know what sex they are.' I was given two choices: take it or leave it, so we returned and Daisy made the beds. I never spoke to the others, and can tell you nothing about them other than that one snored and the other broke wind with alarming frequency. Daisy was sad to leave Australia but perked up on arrival at the five-star Taj Palace Hotel in Dubai (around \u00a360 a night). The highlight for her was a desert safari by four-wheel truck followed by a camel ride and a Bedouin-style feast. The low spot was visiting the zoo - the sight of animals in cramped cages was depressing. Three days on, we flew to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, and stayed in a modest guesthouse for around 1,500 rupees (\u00a317) a night. There were several high dramas caused by cockroaches and lizards, which greatly amused our armed guard. We spenttwo days at the Pearl Continental in Lahore, where a Pakistani friend took us to see one of his acquaintances in the walled city. 'He adores cats and dogs,' we were told. Imagine our surprise when we saw one of his 'cats' was a bloody great lion and there wasn't a cage in sight. We remained in the car and gawped. Daisy went down with Delhi belly and was thoroughly miserable for a whole day. I discovered I can't deal with sick kids, so we were both grumpy. But she quickly recovered, enabling us to travel the 30 kilometres to Wagha, the only land border open between Pakistan and India, to watch the spectacular flag-changing ceremony. There were crowds chanting on both sides of the border and it reminded me of a derby match between Newcastle and Sunderland - the passion, the tribal anger and the explosive atmosphere. Recent tension between both countries had clearly upped the ante. 'Who won?' asked Daisy when the spectacle was over. She then wandered off into India - without a visa. 'Just like her mother,' remarked one of our party as he pulled her back. I loved Lahore because it has a great buzz - a 24-hour city with fascinating bazaars, beautiful mosques and a riveting history. Daisy preferred Peshawar, the ancient frontier town which is inextricably linked with the Khyber Pass. All sorts of invaders and traders have passed through Pesh since 500BC, and you have to be on your guard because so-called guides will try to rip you off, taxi drivers will talk in tens of dollars, and landlords will think of a figure and treble it. The landlord at the Sunshine guesthouse in Peshawar, where we stayed for 2,000 rupees (\u00a323) a night, gave some helpful pointers after a driver wanted to charge $200 (\u00a3137) a day. Eventually we hired someone for 1,200 rupees (\u00a314) a day, and when we crossed the border we found an Afghan who was happy to charge the same rate. I love the drive through the Khyber Pass but Daisy couldn't take her eyes off the armed guard from the Rifles regiment who escorted us - a service offered to every Westerner. While I admit that security is a factor in this region, I would never expose my daughter to extreme danger, and I made sure that our safety was not at risk. Obviously you still need to take care, in the same way you would when walking through the Bronx, Moss Side or even Hackney. There was a great deal of excitement at Torkham as thousands of Afghan refugees were being tempted back home with $100 and a bag of wheat from the UN. Passing through the poppy fields, which have turned Afghanistan into the world's number one heroin producer, we spent the night at a friend's home in Jalalabad and drove up to Kabul the next day with two armed guards. When we arrived it was pouring down - but no one complains after suffering four years of drought. A warning to backpackers - don't go to Afghanistan unless you have a wad of money. It might be the poorest country in the world, but enterprising Afghans are not shy about charging Western prices for their services. One man wanted $100 a night for two rooms, and at the Inter-Continental I was offered the last room, which had no hot water, for $53. I asked him the rate for a room with hot water and he replied: '$53.' In the end we stayed at the Peace Guesthouse which has stunning views over the city for around $80 a night. Daisy was very excited by the atmosphere in Kabul and, like me, has fallen in love with the place. She immersed herself in the culture immediately and within three days could handle a Kalashnikov and play a mean game of poker. She was stunned into silence when we visited a school at Bagrami with the charity MedAir. There were no chairs, desks, books or pens. Daisy handed out lots of sweets and received five fresh eggs from the headmaster, Mohammed Sharif, in return. We also visited two TB-recovery hostels in Kabul but I could tell she felt uncomfortable being around the sick women and children. We manoeuvred around rubble to get into the zoo (less depressing than Dubai's), where the main attraction was the empty compound where Marjan the famous lion had lived; he died in February. There were magnificent birds of prey, a cage full of rabbits and a beautiful black bear with a nose red-raw from a grenade blast. After four days in Kabul, I drove back to Jalalabad and became the country's first female driver since before the Taliban ruled. We stopped off at Sarowbi to eat; silence fell as I walked into the restaurant where eight bearded, turbaned men and two Arabs sat. One came over and told our guide, Akbar, that he recognised me. He asked Akbar if I could recognise any of my captors. I said only if they cared to present themselves to me. He then added: 'We liked what you said about the Taliban when you returned to London. Thank you.' I nodded nervously. Daisy was acting up because she had wanted me to sit in the back of the car with her and not drive. She continued to scowl and generally misbehave. The stranger wearing the heavy turban said to Akbar: 'That child needs a good slap.' Akbar said Daisy was English and that I didn't beat her. He replied: 'I have 10 children and they get a slap every day if I have the time.' I told Daisy what he'd said, and she glared at him. That kid is fearless when she's in a bad mood. However, the love I have for 'that kid' is unconditional and, despite her off-days, I wouldn't change her one bit. We've shared a wonderful experience together and we understand each other much more. I no longer feel the need to defend my maternal skills to sanctimonious critics because my daughter's views and opinions are much more important - and she reckons I'm the best mum in the world. So there. Factfile Yvonne and Daisy Ridley bought tickets from Emirates (0870 243 2222) to Dubai, then at Dubai booked return tickets to Islamabad with Pakistan International Airlines (020 8741 8066) because this was cheaper than buying them in the UK. UK citizens need visas for both Afghanistan and Pakistan. You can purchase these from the relevant embassy in London (Afghanistan: 020 7589 8891, visa \u00a330; Pakistan: 020 7664 9200, visa \u00a340), although the Afghan visa costs less - $30 (\u00a321) - if bought from the Afghanistan Embassy in Islamabad. Advice from the Foreign Office on travel to Afghanistan is as follows: 'We strongly advise against travel to Afghanistan. There is a threat from global terrorism, including to humanitarian relief workers. Following the events of 11 September and the continuing hostilities in Afghanistan, British nationals who, despite our travel advice, are currently in Afghanistan are strongly advised to leave the country immediately.' If, however, like some backpackers, you are desperate to go, the United Nations flies from Islamabad to Kabul. Tickets cost around $1,400 (\u00a31,000) and aid workers take priority. The alternative, Afghanistan's Ariana airline, is still very unreliable. The best thing is to base yourself in Peshawar and take taxis to the border at Torkham and from there to Kabul. Set off from Peshawar at 6am in order to reach Kabul before dusk. Once there, ask your driver to take you to the Peace Guesthouse; space is almost certainly not an issue, though they will find you somewhere else to stay if they're full up. Osama bin Laden's former Kabul home is just one that has been pressed into guesthouse service recently. It is best to go into the country with a mix of rupees and dollars, although money markets will change any currency.
