Saturday's lacklustre performance against Germany, Slovakia's crushing 5-1 victory in Wales last October, the pursuit of third place in Group D and, perhaps most significantly, Craig Bellamy's desire to represent his country provide plenty of incentives for Toshack's side. That was the message Toshack and Bellamy were keen to preach last night as the Wales manager and captain dispelled any suggestion that the Slovakia game had been rendered meaningless. With Wales lying fifth in the group and trailing the second-placed Czech Republic by 10 points, qualification could be officially beyond them after tonight but that possibility will not distract Bellamy, in particular, as he seeks to make up for lost time. The striker missed the Germany defeat because of \"complications\" with his new-born daughter but, after receiving a positive prognosis on Sunday, insisted he never considered staying at home for the Slovakia trip. \"There's always a point with international games,\" said Bellamy. \"It's a chance to add another cap and play for my country and, at the moment, I've been given the role of captaining my country so that's all the drive I need to be out here. \"I am sure everyone understands your family comes first. Everyone knows how passionate I am about football. But my wife and kids mean a lot more. I was reassured from the doctors everything was great and she [Lexi] was going to be coming out in the evening [on Monday]. I would like to have been there but my wife was great about it and I knew coming out here was the only option because everything was safe back home.\" Bellamy, who admitted \"I'm catching up on my sleep and my food intake\" after spending three days at his daughter's bedside, said the prospect of leading his country did not impact on his decision. \"The captaincy had no bearing on me coming here,\" he added. \"I have [reported for Wales] when I was out for five months and Newcastle were sending letters every two minutes saying about suing me if I got injured. I would have been out here no matter what.\" That commitment will need to be replicated on the field this evening as Wales, without the injured Jason Koumas but otherwise at full strength, seek to avenge their heaviest home defeat in 98 years. \"If we had played another half-hour we would have lost by eight,\" said Toshack, recalling the 5-1 loss to Slovakia. The Wales manager, who added, \"we want to get Saturday out of our system as soon as we can\", insisted his side can still usurp the Republic of Ireland and Slovakia. \"Anything other than Germany and the Czech Republic qualifying would be a surprise,\" said Toshack. \"We have three away games [next against Slovakia, Cyprus and San Marino] and we would like to try and get nine points. From the position we are in I think finishing third would be an achievement. I don't think that is beyond us but I think anything else probably is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
