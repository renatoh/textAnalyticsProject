Out of Europe and sliding towards the wrong end of the Premier League table, this was a restorative evening's work for the Portsmouth manager as the FA Cup holders overcame a brave Bristol City side to earn a fourth-round home tie with Swansea City. It was only Portsmouth's second win in nine matches but, with Sunday's pivotal trip to White Hart Lane on the horizon, the significance will not be lost on Adams. City are entitled to feel frustrated that they were unable to force extra time, with Crouch appearing to handle twice in his own area before scoring 17 seconds later and Niko Kranjcar not adding a second until the 88th minute. A tense finale might still have ensued, but David James repelled Nicky Maynard's penalty kick to ease Portsmouth's passage. With the 0-0 draw at Fratton Park still fresh in the mind and their midfield options restricted through injuries, Portsmouth could have been forgiven for fearing another uncomfortable 90 minutes here. City had proved to be well-organised and disciplined opponents on the south coast but there were signs that the Championship side would face a much more severe examination on their own ground long before Peter Crouch tapped home seven minutes before the interval. With Glen Johnson a burgeoning presence on the right and Armand Traor\u00e9 shimmering with menace on the left, Portsmouth carried a threat on both flanks that left City gasping for breath in the opening 20 minutes as they sought to gain a foothold. Traor\u00e9's stinging 25-yard shot, which was turned behind by Adriano Basso, might have yielded an opening yet it was save at the opposite end that provided the main talking point before Crouch's goal. Marvin Elliott's diving header from Maynard's cross was destined for the bottom corner until James flung out a left-hand and saved brilliantly. City were slowly beginning to eke their way into the game but, having struck the post in the 34th minute, when David Nugent stabbed goal-bound from the corner of the six-yard box, Portsmouth took the lead moments later after an exhilarating counter-attack, but one started when Crouch juggled the ball. Nadir Belhadj fed Traor\u00e9 on the right and the winger, who is on loan from Arsenal, skipped around Liam Fontaine before cutting back for Crouch to convert a routine one-touch finish. There was a golden chance to double both his and Portsmouth's tally eight minutes after the restart, but Crouch somehow skewed wide with Basso horribly exposed. City were far from chastened, however, and seized control for a period in the second half. But any prospect of an upset disappeared when Belhadj squared for Kranjcar to slot beyond Basso."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
