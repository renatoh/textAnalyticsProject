The Arsenal manager was reacting to news that the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, intends lobbying the European Union to ensure clubs are permitted to field a maximum of five foreign players. \"That would kill the Premier League,\" said Wenger. \"It would certainly no longer be the best league in the world. I would not be happy if somebody told me that I have to say to a player: 'Sorry, you have the ability to play but you weren't born in the right place'.\" The Premier League has also come out against Blatter's plan. \"Clubs are making huge investments in their academies. Academy players are coming through at first-team level and national-team level,\" said its spokesman, Dan Johnson. \"They have to be at the requisite standard. It's better to have quality youngsters coming through than being forced to play players who frankly aren't up to playing Premier League or even national level.\" Blatter argues that imposing a core of homegrown players would preserve clubs' identities, but Wenger disputes that. \"A club's identity is linked to values, not where you come from. Personally I try my best to represent Arsenal values even though I wasn't born in London.\" Supporters of Blatter's proposal also insist that imposing a quota on foreigners would boost the development of local players and, in the case of England, help the national team to win the World Cup. But Wenger, who only twice this season has named an Englishman in a Premier League starting line-up, suggested that reasoning was flawed. \"Do you really believe that if I regularly picked five average English players, England would win the World Cup?\" he said. Citing Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand, he said that England had shown it was capable of producing world-class players and that limiting their exposure to other world-class players would be detrimental to national interests. \"It's like with schools,\" he explained. \"If you put a gifted child in a bad class he'll go down. But if you put him in a good class he'll get even better.\" The Arsenal manager pointed out that laying the foundations for successful national teams was not a club manager's job. He may be renowned for encouraging imaginative play but he insists that, when it comes to selecting his team, reason must rule, and that means being free to recruit the best players. \"The purpose is to push the level up as high as possible and to entertain,\" he said. Another part of his job is to bring success to Arsenal and his team could go further to fulfilling that brief by beating Sunderland tomorrow, keeping them top of the league and extending their winning streak to 10 matches, their best run since the \"invincible\" season of 2003-04. The visiting manager, however, pooped several Arsenal parties as a player, often amid acrimony, and Wenger has been impressed by Roy Keane's nascent career as a coach. \"As a player he had the charisma of a leader, so I always knew he would be able to handle players,\" Wenger said. \"What I didn't know was whether he'd have the patience to handle the press and directors and all the rest of it. He has seemed surprisingly calm but you could see towards the end of his playing days that he was trying to tame his more impulsive side.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
