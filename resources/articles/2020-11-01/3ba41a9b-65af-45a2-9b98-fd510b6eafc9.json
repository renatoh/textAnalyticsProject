But in 2020, it\u2019s taken on a new urgency. With many organisations subject to Covid-enforced hiring freezes, retaining key staff has become more important than ever. And without being able to rely on old mainstays such as Friday afternoon pub drinks or water cooler chit-chat, creating the sort of culture that keeps employees around is now also more of a challenge. The big question for employers is: how can you keep staff happy and engaged when you\u2019re not in the same building? \u201cI get asked this a lot,\u201d says Jason Laufer, the senior director for LinkedIn Learning and Glint in the Australia Pacific region. \u201c[This year] has really been a massive shake-up.\u201d Luckily, Laufer says, \u201cthere\u2019s a number of things you can do\u201d, starting with thinking about the tools and processes that can help with people management. Just as organisations turned to technology such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom to keep their teams connected at the dawn of the pandemic, today leaders need to consider data-led tools such as Glint as a way to stay plugged in to their staff\u2019s performance and job satisfaction. These tools go beyond just the recruitment phase of HR: they\u2019re designed to help leaders get the best out of staff across their entire employment. They also monitor whether staff feel happy and supported. Glint conducts quarterly company surveys that allow employers to pulse-check the mood among staff. That data is delivered to organisations in a number of ways: one is a heat map that shows HR how different managers are performing against peer groups or industry benchmarks. The platform is also equipped with artificial intelligence that generates alerts when it sees decreased employee performance, so leaders can intervene before they have problems. Data-led tools are also important because they reveal staff pain points. Concerns can\u2019t be addressed if employers don\u2019t know what they are. For instance, Glint data insight reports have found that burnout risk among employees reached a two-year high in August 2020, and that one in five employees feel their employers aren\u2019t doing enough to help them feel connected. That matters, Laufer says. \u201cEmployees who [say] that their employers help them feel connected are four times more likely to report feeling well supported in their organisation. So there\u2019s a direct correlation between feeling connected, feeling well supported and being productive.\u201d To that end, he recommends \u201chaving really pointed initiatives\u201d to foster connectivity, such as regular virtual huddles and one-on-ones. Offering ongoing virtual training can also help keep staff engaged. Laufer calls it a \u201csuper important factor\u201d in retention because it makes employees feel invested in. And there\u2019s a big appetite for upskilling right now: LinkedIn Learning has seen a spike in the amount of hours spent on the platform in 2020, with many of its most popular courses this year focused around remote work, time management and working from home (WFH). Essential training courses around software such as Excel have also been a big hit, as employees strive to master the tools they need to be effective while working from home.

Ultimately, using data-led tools in HR and management is about going beyond just the logistical elements of facilitating remote working and thinking long term. That\u2019s imperative for employers, because we know the WFH era won\u2019t end when the pandemic does. Laufer says employers expect almost 40% of staff to regularly work from home once the Covid threat has passed, while a majority of Australians want the option of remote work in the future. \u201cIf the pandemic was a month and then it was all over, we probably would have gone back to normal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here we are eight months, nine months in, and the world has pretty much changed forever. So organisations need to move towards what employees want around remote work.\u201d Laufer believes 2020 has revolutionised the Australian workforce. \u201cIt really has fast-tracked the work-from-home era. And what our data is showing us is that employees, albeit challenged by the pandemic and the restrictions, are actually enjoying more flexibility working from home and getting more balance.\u201d It\u2019s clear that remote work is here to stay. Now, the task for employers is creating a culture that thrives in the new normal - no water cooler necessary.
