The fragile state of many council social care budgets \u2013 coupled with growing demand for services, increasing NHS pressure, and spiralling staff costs \u2013 is highlighted in research by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). It says councils \u201ccannot go on\u201d without a sustainable long-term funding strategy to underpin social care and warns that continuing cuts to budgets risk leaving thousands of people who need care being left without services. \u201cThe overall picture is of a sector struggling to meet need and maintain quality in the context of rising costs, increasingly complex care needs, a fragile provider market and pressures from an NHS which itself is in critical need of more funding,\u201d the annual \u201cstate of the nation\u201d survey says. It reveals English councils plan to push through social care cuts of \u00a3700m in 2018-19, equivalent to nearly 5% of the total \u00a314.5bn budget. Since 2010, social care spending in England has shrunk by \u00a37bn. A government green paper on adult social care funding is expected in the next few weeks, and while councils are hopeful this could put budgets on a firmer footing over time, they warn that extra funding is needed to shore up services in the short term. \u201cSocial care is essentially about making sure we not only look after people with profound and increasingly complex needs, but also help many transform their lives. Sadly, however, this budget survey reveals, once again this essential care and support is just not being given the resources it needs,\u201d said the president of Adass, Glen Garrod. He added: \u201cWe cannot go on like this. How we help people live the life they want, how we care and support people in our families and communities, and how we ensure carers get the support they need is at stake \u2013 it\u2019s time for us to deliver the secure future that so very many people in need of social care urgently need.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe know the social care system is under pressure \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve provided an extra \u00a39.4bn over three years. We will shortly set out our plans to reform the system, which will include the workforce and a sustainable funding model supported by a diverse, vibrant and stable market.\u201d The Adass survey says the social care market is \u201cincreasingly fragile and failing\u201d in some parts of the country, with almost a third of councils reporting that residential and nursing home care providers have closed down or handed back contracts. Although councils are spending an increasing proportion of their total budget on adult social care \u2013 almost 38p in every pound in 2018-19, compared with 34p in 2010 \u2013 social care directors admit they will have to continue to reduce the number of people in receipt of care packages. The survey reveals councils are increasingly reliant on so-called \u201cself help\u201d or \u201casset-based\u201d approaches to care \u2013 in effect using networks of family and neighbourhood groups to provide volunteer support for some social care recipients. Half of local authorities overspent on adult social care budgets in 2017-18, the survey finds, with half of these drawing on council reserves to meet the overspend. The National Audit Office has warned that about 10% of councils will exhaust reserves in three years at current rates of deployment, putting them at risk of insolvency. Ministers acknowledged the financial crisis facing council adult social care services last year, when they provided \u00a32.6bn over three years through a combination of grants and by enabling councils to raise extra social care funds locally through a council tax precept. Adass says this injection of cash helped stave off financial collapse in some council areas. But it warns that the additional funding has \u201ctemporarily relieved, rather than resolved\u201d the long-term funding needs of the sector and there is a danger council services could collapse before any new arrangements are in place. Although councils have a legal duty to ensure there is a functioning care market in their area, nearly four in five say they are concerned that they are unable to guarantee this because of the fragility of many care firm balance sheets and rising care staff wage bills. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, the chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: \u201cCouncils and providers are doing all they can to help ensure older and disabled people receive high quality care, but unless immediate action is taken to tackle increasingly overstretched council budgets, the adult social care tipping point, which we have long warned about, will be breached and councils risk not being able to fulfil their statutory duty under the Care Act.\u201d Richard Murray, the director of policy at The King\u2019s Fund, said: \u201cThis latest evidence, from every council in England, lays bare once again the need for, as the prime minister put it herself, a proper plan to pay for and provide social care. \u201cOlder and disabled people and their families and carers continue to be let down by a system that is on its knees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
