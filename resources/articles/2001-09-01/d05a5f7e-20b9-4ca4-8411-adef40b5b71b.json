Matthew Johns, Wigan's current stand-off, will return to Sydney for personal reasons at the end of the year and the club chairman Maurice Lindsay has been scouring the game for a replacement. Lindsay has confirmed his interest in O'Neill, unquestionably a talented player but with a dreadful record of getting into trouble off the field. He was arrested for urinating in a Gold Coast casino while with the Brisbane Broncos, and was sacked after a single appearance for the London Broncos because the police spotted him playing when the match was screened and called him in for an offence committed during a stint with Widnes. However, he has cleaned up his act sufficiently to play for the past two years with the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville, where his form has been good enough to earn a recall to Queensland's State of Origin side. \"We all know about Julian's reputation but he can play,\" said Lindsay. But he insisted: \"We're looking at three stand-offs, and it is fair to say that one of them may have a European passport.\" That suggests Costin, a Republic of Ireland passport-holder who changed his surname from Pearson after a drugs controversy while at Canberra. He has been out standing for Huddersfield this season and signed a new two-year deal last month, since when the Giants have been relegated. Wigan have joined Hull in giving Bradford Bulls permission to put back their first play-off match by 48 hours to Sunday week with a 6.35pm kick-off. The game, against the winners of tomorrow night's Wigan-Hull qualifying play-off, was due to have been played on the Friday but Bradford City, the Bulls' landlords at Valley Parade, would not allow rugby to be played on the pitch before their First Division match the following day. \"I believe Headingley was standing by, but we thought it would be wrong to ask Bradford to give up home advantage which they have earned by finishing on top of the table,\" said Lindsay. \"We want to win the Super League title fair and square.\" St Helens' David Fairleigh has decided to retire from playing. \"He doesn't think his body can take another year,\" said the Saints coach Ian Millward, who had ruled the Australian prop out of Saturday's Super League elimination play-off against Leeds with a shoulder injury although he could return the following week if required. Warrington have signed Darren Burns, an experienced loose forward who played in Brisbane Broncos' play-off victory over St George last weekend. Burns may lose his place this Sunday to Gorden Tallis, Australia's vice-captain in last year's World Cup who is to return five months ahead of schedule after spinal surgery. Widnes have agreed a new two-year contract with Phil Cantillon, the hooker who was a key figure when they won promotion to the Super League. Martin Pearson has left Wakefield to join Pau, the French rugby union club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
