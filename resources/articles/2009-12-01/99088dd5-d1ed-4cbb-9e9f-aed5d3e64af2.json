After rising for four consecutive sessions last week, the index of blue-chip shares pushed through the psychologically important barrier of 5,400 on Christmas Eve to notch up the highest close for 15 months. At 5,402.41, the market was back to where it was before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. The market is now set for another rise as it catches up with rallies on overseas stock exchanges and gets support from higher oil prices, increases in other commodities and reports of a bumper weekend for retailers on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US stocks ticked higher at the open, as falls in airline shares \u2013 weighed by security fears \u2013 were offset by rising commodity-related stocks and big demand for retailers after news that pre-Christmas sales rose 3.6%, according to MasterCard Advisors unit, SpendingPulse. That followed a 1% rise for Japan's Nikkei to its highest in four months. Commodity prices also ended higher with oil breaking through $78 a barrel in cold weather and copper rallying on supply concerns. The few equity traders who venture into the office in this quiet post-Christmas week will be wary of taking any big positions before the end of the year and the FTSE 100 looks set to build on last week's gains. The London market has now powered ahead by 56% since reaching its nadir of 3,461 points in the dark days of March. For the year so far, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares is ahead by 22%. Many see the rise continuing in the new year. Extrabet, a sports and financial betting site, is taking bets on the FTSE 100 passing the 6,000 mark in 2010 and sees this as more likely than not. As the FTSE 100 powered higher in a pre-Christmas rally it was offering odds of 10/11 on the key level being hit next year. David Buik at the inter-dealer broker BGC Partners also sees the FTSE's rally continuing but he believes big pressures, particularly from worries over the creditworthiness of big government bond issuers including the UK, will see the index drop back in the second half of 2010. Buik says economic growth looks \"very patchy\" in the months ahead although the US is \"potentially looking buoyant\". He notes some other bright spots as well. \"Private equity may be back in the vanguard next year. Technology is in great shape with Apple's share price reaching a record level ... There is a strong feeling that IPOs [initial public stock offerings] and general M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] activity will give impetus to the growth of existing large companies,\" he says. But he sees a number of pressures on British economy, which according to official data last week is mired in its deepest recession since the second world war. He also highlighted weak UK bank lending, against a backdrop of rising unemployment and a \"brittle housing market\". In terms of what that means for the FTSE, he echoes other market experts. \"The most important factor it has going for it is that there is no correlation between the FTSE 100 and the UK's economy. The constitution of the FTSE is predominantly international \u2013 70% of the FTSE's earning power comes from abroad: mining, oil, energy, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, food, telecoms and even banking. \"The FTSE is left with a few retail operators and utility companies as barometers of the UK economy,\" he says. \"There is every chance that the FTSE will crack on for the first six months of 2010, possibly reaching close to 6,000.\" The all-time high for the FTSE 100 was 6,950 reached 10 years ago in December 1999. But sovereign debt all over the world could pose \"massive problems\" this coming year, he predicts, while big job cuts ahead in the public sector will hurt UK retailers and dent growth. Furthermore, there lies ahead the inevitable exit from the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme. Buik said: \"If the FTSE 100 closes [at the end of the year] above 5,300, investors will have had a right royal result!\" Strategists at Morgan Stanley are even gloomy. Their target for the end of 2010 is 5,000and they highlight \"nervousness about the durability of economic growth as and when policy support is withdrawn.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
