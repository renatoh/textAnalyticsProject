The 63-year-old and her 70-year-old husband John live in Tuncurry. A few years ago, the retired couple settled in the idyllic spot on the New South Wales north coast after selling their Sydney home and closing their trucking company after 37 years of hard work. She has an underlying condition that has seen her lungs collapse a few times over the years, while John has just finished 13 months of immunotherapy for melanoma. After reading news stories of Italian doctors being forced to choose which patients to treat, she\u2019s worried about their chances. The other day, she shared her fears with her young grandson, who could sense she was upset. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I can understand them saving the younger person.\u2019 I said, \u2018But I\u2019d still like a chance too.\u2019 He got it straight away, and he said, \u2018No, they won\u2019t do it, Granny.\u2019 He said, \u2018I won\u2019t let them.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s been a harrowing time for the couple. Just a few months ago, bushfires threatened their home, which is not far from bushland. Marcia remembers packing and unpacking things three times as the emergency warnings came and then abated. She only really panicked when she realised her unflappably laidback husband was concerned. \u201cThat was the very first time I\u2019ve ever seen him worried. He didn\u2019t actually say he was worried, not to me. To me, he was always upbeat and, \u2018We\u2019ll be right\u2019 ... But then I overheard him telling a friend that rang up, \u2018Mate, I\u2019m pretty scared, actually, I\u2019m pretty worried. It\u2019s looking pretty bad up here.\u2019\u201d One night, as the fires drew close, the couple took turns resting for an hour at a time. Marcia remembers lying there worrying their time was up: \u201c[I remember thinking] \u2018We\u2019ve been together all this time, we\u2019ve waited all this time to have a bit of a life together\u2019 ... And I thought, \u2018Is this, now, how it\u2019s all going to end? We\u2019re just going to be burned to death?\u2019\u201d Fortunately they came through the bushfires unscathed. But now they\u2019re doing their best to get through the coronavirus crisis, staying indoors away from everyone as much as possible. They\u2019ve already gotten used to being around each other 24/7. \u201cWe\u2019re not on top of each other,\u201d says John. \u201cOur house is a reasonable size, so we don\u2019t have to be sitting there if we\u2019re disagreeing with what show we\u2019re watching. I can just go to another room and watch my show, and Marcia will watch her show.\u201d During their 44 years together, these two have been through countless ups and downs \u2013 and they\u2019re still bantering through it. They met on January 26 in 1976 at Tralee Speedway in Canberra. Marcia was almost 19 and had never been to the car races before, while John was 26 and a hotshot Speedway driver. Marcia and her friend got talking to Daryl, one of John\u2019s pit crew and his best friend. That night after the races, the foursome met up. There was an almost instant connection between John and Marcia. He thought she was very nice and \u201cvery pretty\u201d. He remembers she had her waist-long hair tucked up into a blue cap. \u201cI\u2019m impressed he remembers,\u201d Marcia says drily. They saw each other again the following day, with Marcia introducing him to her family. But after that it was a long-distance relationship, with John based in Sydney and Marcia in Canberra. There were plenty of long phone calls and letters exchanged. So what was in the letters? \u201cThe normal rubbish that you carry on with trying to impress the girl,\u201d says John. They got engaged quickly and were married seven months after meeting. \u201cWe were over the long-distance thing and we knew we were going to be together,\u201d says John. \u201cSo better just to get married and move in together and be done with it.\u201d But it meant that Marcia had to give up her promising finance job in Canberra and move to Sydney. There was another complication: John had been married before and had the lion\u2019s share of the custody of his two children. He was a truck driver and constantly on the road, so Marcia had to look after the children. It wasn\u2019t an easy time. \u201cI thought it was going to be like the Brady Bunch,\u201d she says. \u201cI was fairly naive. And I soon came down to reality.\u201d Two years after they were married, they had a daughter. John knew it was tough on Marcia: \u201cShe was taking care of all that, bringing up the kids and the schooling and everything and it was new to her. So she did the best she could, and done a pretty good job of it.\u201d But the two retained a strong connection. \u201cOrdinarily he\u2019s the one who grounds me, and if I\u2019m too upset, he makes me laugh,\u201d says Marcia. John is rarely ruffled: \u201cNothing really worries me. I just take each day as it comes and whatever happens, happens.\u201d They\u2019re straightforward with each other and opposites in many ways, so they don\u2019t mind a hearty debate. \u201cHe does his thing, I do mine. But we yell a lot, because I\u2019m very vocal in my opinions to do with government and politics, and he\u2019s pretty vocal.\u201d It usually winds up with John walking away. Marcia doesn\u2019t always appreciate that, but things simmer down. \u201cI just storm around and play slamming doors and all this sort of stuff \u2019till I calm down. Then he\u2019ll walk back in two hours later and say, \u2018How you going, darl?\u2019.\u201d Their different skill sets came in handy when they ran the trucking company together. They built it into a thriving business with contracts with large freighting companies and employees in Sydney and Melbourne. They worked well together. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Well, I\u2019m pretty good at finances. You\u2019re pretty good at trucks and organising people, getting the maximum number of trucks and getting it up to the destination on time,\u2019\u201d says Marcia. \u201cSo you do your bit, I\u2019ll do my bit, and you just keep out of what I\u2019m doing and same. So that worked for about five minutes.\u201d They had a good cop, bad cop routine going, remembers John: \u201cI let people get away with overdue accounts and stuff like that, whereas Marcia wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d put the foot down and say, \u2018Yeah, your 30 days is up. Pay your bill.\u2019\u201d Work inevitably spilled into their home life, with both of them working six days a week, all year round. There was plenty of the pressure on the relationship. \u201cWe were like ships that crossed in the night for a lot of years,\u201d says Marcia. Although there were lots of arguments, they didn\u2019t have time for any real disagreements, says John. \u201cIf a problem came up, it had to be solved straight away. So we talked about that and came to an agreement [about] what we would do about it.\u201d Neither are good at showing weakness or asking for help. Even when Marcia was very ill with her lung condition, John didn\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 something she doesn\u2019t let him live down. But there\u2019s a sense that he would be lost if anything serious did happen. \u201cI dread the day if she does get really sick,\u201d he finally admits, before joking: \u201cI\u2019d drive you to the hospital. Let someone else look after you.\u201d She would also worry about him endlessly when he was driving trucks. \u201cInevitably, every single trip he\u2019s come home and tell me some sort of horror story ... that made it 50 times worse. So it was stressful.\u201d Eventually he decided to close up the business. It wasn\u2019t Marcia\u2019s decision but reluctantly she agreed. They sold their Sydney home and move to Tuncurry. These days they\u2019re settled in their own routines, together and doing their own thing. \u201cI enjoy my life [\u201cYou would,\u201d retorts Marcia] and enjoy the company I\u2019ve got ... I\u2019m very happy with what we\u2019ve had and hope there\u2019s a few more years left to go.\u201d They rarely discuss their relationship much: \u201cWe\u2019re too busy talking about aches and pains,\u201d says Marcia. John says: \u201cWe just take it for granted that we\u2019re together and we\u2019re stuck together, so [we] learn to live with it.\u201d They still tease each other mercilessly. \u201cWe always have a shot at each other about how you\u2019re doing this and you should be doing it a different way,\u201d says John. Not everyone would understand their jokes, particularly their colourful names for each other. \u201cIf anyone else walked in, they\u2019d look.\u201d And I\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, we\u2019re just mucking around.\u201d So they\u2019d still look. \u201cNo, no, seriously. That\u2019s how we talk to each other.\u201d \u201cI think laughter [is important],\u201d says Marcia. \u201cFinding someone that shares that weird sense of humour that you might have.\u201d John agrees: \u201cEveryone has their disagreements, but I would say: don\u2019t carry a grudge. I always say there\u2019s two sides to every story. No matter how bad the story is, there\u2019s still another side of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s seriously so annoying. He\u2019s so Mr Nice Guy,\u201d Marcia jokes. But for a moment, she\u2019s serious, describing John as fair and trustworthy: \u201cHe\u2019s a very good guy. He\u2019s got some irritating faults, like I have, but on the whole, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with anyone else.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
