The incident is believed to have happened late last night at the Millenium Plaza as the rest of Mark Hughes' squad assembled at the team hotel on the outskirts of the city. Hughes said: \"There has been an incident, but no, he has not been sent home. He didn't train on Monday but I hope he will be fit for the weekend.\" FAW spokesman Ceri Stennett added: \"We are investigating, but wish to make no further comment.\" South Wales Police issued a statement saying: \"Enquiries are on-going into an incident.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
