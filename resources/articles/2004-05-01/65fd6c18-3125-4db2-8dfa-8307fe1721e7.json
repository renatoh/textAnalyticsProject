Northamptonshire's overnight pair of Tim Roberts and Martin van Jaarsveld were cruising in the morning when Sami suddenly produced a throat ball that gave the tall South African no chance and he could only parry to first slip. This was the Pakistani fast bowler's first championship wicket and, following a rain-extended lunch break, he added three more in six balls. Roberts, after a careful 69, glanced back to see his off-stump cartwheeling. In the next over Min Patel induced a bat-pad catch from Usman Afzaal before tossing the ball back to Sami. Graeme Swann's off-stump was hit by a ball that kept low and jagged in and Gerard Brophy's woodwork was completely rearranged by a 90mph explosion. \"Get behind the line\" was the shouted advice from a satisfied Kent member safe on the balcony. From 123 for one, Northamptonshire had tottered to 147 for six. Northants, now seeking parity rather than first-innings dominance, were in the hands of their skipper David Sales, broad of beam and bat. But no one could keep him company for long and, with a second bonus point secured, Jason Brown smeared Andrew Symonds to extra-cover to give Kent a four-run advantage first time around. Sami's 22 overs had cost a mere 39 runs, with Symonds and Patel chipping in. In the evening Kent drew further ahead when David Fulton and Rob Key, blasted away early by Johann Louw in the first innings, calmly compiled an unbroken stand of 103 by stumps. David Harrison, with a career-best five for 75, helped Glamorgan into a commanding position in their Second Division match against Durham. The 6ft 4in seamer's second five-wicket haul in successive matches saw Durham dismissed for 220, 173 behind. Glamorgan did not enforce the follow-on and, despite the loss of 35 overs to rain, they stretched their lead by 77 for the loss of Matthew Elliott and Darren Thomas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
