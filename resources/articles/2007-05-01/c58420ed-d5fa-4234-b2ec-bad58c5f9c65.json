The 34-year-old scrum-half held his place in the Wallabies squad for this season's internationals but was stripped of the captaincy after the selectors named Stirling Mortlock and Phil Waugh as co-skippers. Australia's coach John Connolly did not rule out Gregan captaining the side again but said the management preferred the shared-leadership approach. \"We just thought it was the way to go,\" Connolly said.\"We've tried very hard to spread it around and I think it is the way forward.\" Gregan said he supported the change, even though he indicated last year that he wanted to lead the team to the World Cup before retiring from the Wallabies. \"It's great for both Phil and Stirling to increase the leadership right throughout the group,\" Gregan said. \"[This] is something John spoke about and the team has identified as an area we really need to strengthen. You need probably half-a-dozen good leaders in your group.\" Gregan has captained Australia a record 58 times since taking over from John Eales when he retired in 2001 but rumours about his impending demotion had been circulating for weeks. He has been increasingly criticised over the past few years for his performances, prompting mounting calls for him to stand down and make way for a younger No9. He opted to skip last year's end-of-season tour of Europe to save himself for the World Cup, and that may have proved his undoing. Mortlock and Waugh both captained the team and Matt Giteau made a brilliant impression at scrum-half. Giteau, who normally plays at inside-centre or fly-half, performed so well that Connolly said he was seriously considering playing him at scrum-half this season and moving Gregan to the bench. But Connolly added he was still torn about where to start Giteau but planned to try both at scrum-half in the two-Test series against Wales, which starts on Saturday. \"We're still resolving the half-back and inside-centre positions and, by all means, George is still in the frame,\" Connolly said. Gregan plans to quit after the World Cup to take up a contract with the French club Toulon. Fly-half Stephen Larkham is also in his final year as a Test player and will join Edinburgh in October. The half-back pair have more than 20 years of international experience and 222 Test caps between them. Connolly expects the home Tests against Wales, Fiji and the Tri-Nations will be represent an emotional finish for the two players. \"There's no doubt that we are seeing the end of two outstanding careers ... two of the game's greatest-ever players\" Connolly said. \"A series win over Wales and a Tri-Nations victory would provide a fitting farewell for George and Stephen.\" The 25-man Australia A squad includes former rugby league player Clinton Schifcofske, who joined Queensland Reds from Canberra Raiders last year.
