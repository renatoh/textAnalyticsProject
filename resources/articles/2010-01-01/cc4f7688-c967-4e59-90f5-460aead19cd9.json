The band sometimes reveals a skewed-romantic Django Bates/Loose Tubes connection that may come down through Waldmann's enthusiasm for former Tubes saxist Julian Arguelles, but they also touch on the ambiguities of Wayne Shorter, the catchy ostinato-led themes of Avishai Cohen, and the bright lyricism of Chick Corea \u2013 the latter particularly caught by excellent pianist Rob Barron. Singer Emilia Martensson unfurls the wistful theme of Unresolved (the only vocal), before Waldmann's arresting and sonorous sax enters to develop the song's melodic potential. Jasper Hoiby's powerful rising bass vamp, echoed by Barron's piano, catches the Cohen feel on Russell's Resurgence, and Waldmann's luxurious tenor sound and poised phrasing are both tradition-rooted and restlessly contemporary in the more loose-limbed episodes midway through. Kairos 4Tet mixes group-sensitive and freewheeling jazz improv and memorable themes with an elan that's likely to put it on a lot of people's \"rising UK stars\" list this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
