The editorial director of Britain's biggest magazine company is overseeing its most ambitious launch programme for a generation from the 17th floor of King's Reach Tower, surrounded by security that wouldn't look out of place in a Bond film. Staff can't come and go without special passes and there are no windows to peer through; page plans have been taken down from the walls and dummy issues removed. Security is paramount because IPC's fierce rival Emap is also planning new titles as the nation's two most powerful magazine companies resume hostilities after a five-year hiatus. The flow of new titles stalled because Emap was recovering from an ill-conceived American acquisition and IPC was retrenching after a management buyout, but both are back in growth mode now that IPC has been bought by Time Warner, the world's biggest media group, and Emap has recovered from its disastrous US foray. IPC is likely to launch at least one major magazine a year at a cost of between \u00a35 million and \u00a315m per title, at a time when the magazine market is more competitive than ever. The number of consumer titles published has increased fivefold in the last 20 years, Soutar points out, yet the number sold is the same now as it was in the mid-1980s (1.3 billion a year, to be precise). 'Magazines that are less than 10 years old account for 40 per cent of sales, so if you don't have a robust and sustainable launch programme you're going to lose market share; simple mathematics will tell you that,' he says. Soutar is an amiable if businesslike Scot regarded by many in the magazine industry as a future chief executive. Appointed to the IPC board four years ago after being poached from Dennis publishing, he previously spent 11 years at Emap, making his name as editor of the phenomenally successful men's title FHM. That gives him useful experience for the first major skirmish between IPC and Emap, taking place in the newly created weekly 'lad's mag' market. At the moment, IPC's Nuts is outselling Emap's Zoo, although both look likely to breach the 300,000 barrier by the end of the year. Cut, a third entrant launched recently by German group Bauer, has been poorly received by critics. 'I have a belief that you should never underestimate your rivals... but that really starts to stretch your credibility. The day that magazine came in, people were very quietly leafing through it in the office and kind of looking up with a puzzled look on their face,' says Soutar. Nuts editor Phil Hilton was less kind. 'It's shite,' he said. Soutar claims IPC has been galvanised by Nuts ' success, which has shown that there is a market for a weekly men's title where none previously existed. 'I think that magazine companies come alive when they are launching mags.' He has interesting observations about the challenges facing publishers in the digital age, though magazine groups are faring far better than newspapers, grappling with a slow but steady circulation decline in the face of competition from digital television and the internet. 'We wanted something that was for a generation of viewers rather than for a generation of readers, because that's what we're dealing with whether we like it or not. 'There are lots of people who have a very orthodox view of readers as people who want to read things. They don't. They want to absorb information. They want to be entertained. There are lots of different ways of doing that and the written word is only one of them, so we set out to produce a very fast-paced magazine that men could just inhale - a very disposable mag. Nuts and magazines like it will change men's expectation about the way the media presents information to them.' That has implications for tabloid newspapers, especially if - as seems likely - the likes of Nuts and Zoo begin to publish twice or even three times a week. Soutar nearly ended up in newspapers after joining a management team assembled by broadcaster Chris Evans and PR man Matthew Freud that came close to buying the Daily Star four years ago. Soutar, who would have been editor, describes it as a 'mad caper' but reveals that Evans and his venture capital backers were just four days from announcing a deal to the stock market. But when it came to the crunch, Evans's backers pulled out. Soutar knows the men's market inside out and some of his harsher critics describe him as 'a one-trick pony', although they acknowledge that growing FHM 's sales from 50,000 to 500,000 from 1994-1997 is a fairly impressive trick. 'Our strategy to begin with was... how can we catch up with GQ, which was selling 100,000 at the time. That was Himalayan, that was in the clouds. Then this absolutely phenomenal product called Loaded came in and managed to do something that no one had done before, and that was to create a mag that real men wanted to read.' Soutar acknowledges that Loaded 'inspired' FHM, which became the publishing sensation of the 1990s. 'It was a complete and utter shock. We did go from 50,000 sales to 500,000 sales in under three years. Your ears start to pop. I got the career equivalent of vertigo because I suddenly thought it would all collapse'. Soutar left to run Emap's radio station Kiss FM, his only major stint away from men's titles since landing his first big job editing Smash Hits in his early twenties. He returned to publishing after two years, doing for the US edition of Maxim what he'd done for the UK edition of FHM. '[Maxim owner] Felix Dennis called me up and showed me a large suitcase full of used tenners,' he laughs. 'For \"bloke\" in Britain read \"guy\" in America. Guy culture was invented there, so it was kind of taking coals to Newcastle, but none of the American publishing companies had the bottle to do it and Felix did - he's a buccaneer and he's got balls of solid brass.' A former colleagues says Soutar's affable manner disguises an aggressive streak and there is no doubting his ambition. This year he took a five-week management crash course at the University of Michigan, a sort of mini-MBA. Would he like to run a business again? 'Yes, I'm not overseeing businesses like I have in the past,' he concedes. Surely a shoo-in for the chief executive's role once the incumbent Sylvia Auton leaves? 'We have a fantastic chief executive and I love being on her board,' Soutar replies with a smile.
