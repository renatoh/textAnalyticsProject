With a maximum of 51 points on offer, Vauxhall Racing driver Giovanardi needs to score nine more than SEAT's Jason Plato, who qualified in 10th place, in order to secure the crown. The Italian multiple-champion, who won twice around the Indy circuit at the season opener in his Vectra, said: 'If you look at the grid, it's very tight, especially the top 11 cars. My car honestly is perfect, but with the ballast I could not set a better time - and I tried everything, changing the line and my style.' If Giovanardi triumphs today, it will be the 41 year-old's eighth top-line touring car title, following wins in the Spanish, Italian and European (now World) touring car championships. 'Me and Jason are side by side for the first race, but I'm OK about that - there are three races to do it in,' he said. 'Maybe the second race, without the ballast, will be the one as many times I've had big results like that. It's been a completely different championship this year, the team has given me a very reliable car so I've had less wins, but still I am leading the series.' Team RAC's Jelley set the fastest time of 49.297sec in his BMW 320si during yesterday's dry qualifying session at the Kent track, and will line up on the front row alongside BMW Dealer Team UK driver Mat Jackson in the same model car. Jackson is hoping to beat Jelley's team-mate Colin Turkington, who will start from sixth position, to the Independents' title but heads into the first race 22 points behind him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
