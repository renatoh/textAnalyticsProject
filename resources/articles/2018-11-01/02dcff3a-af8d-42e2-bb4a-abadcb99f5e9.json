Slightly exceeding projected revenues, with $62.9bn, the tech giant is up roughly 20% over last year. The chief executive, Tim Cook, and chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, cited strong performances from services like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, which reached an all time high of $10bn. Cook said in a statement the company was \u201cthrilled to report another record-breaking quarter that caps a tremendous fiscal 2018, the year in which we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple\u2019s history\u201d. However, Apple stocks dropped 7% in extended trading as Cook warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations. He blamed a weakness in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India for the more downbeat outlook. The fall wiped about $70bn off the company\u2019s market value, taking it below the trillion dollar mark. The emphasis on services might signify a shift in the company\u2019s focus. In the future, Apple may lean less on product sales, which have become somewhat static. In this quarter, the company shipped 46.8 million iPhones, a 13% increase over last quarter\u2019s 41.3 million sold. The iPhone XS, the latest model that was released in September, likely won\u2019t show up in sales until next quarter, but analysts are expecting an overall slowdown in sales going forward. \u201cPeople just aren\u2019t buying smartphones like they used to,\u201d Jim Cridlin, the global head of innovation and partnership at Mindshare, a media agency owned by WPP. \u201cIn addition to that, consumers are moving beyond the screen. Voice and automated reality are changing the way consumers react and interact with their phones,\u201d he added, explaining that, like its competitor Amazon, Apple might be foregoing its core business, in favor of future growth. Cridlin says ads could be the next big thing for Apple. \u201cThe model they have set up around app advertising right now is pretty compelling,\u201d he says, adding that in recent years Apple has become the largest marketplace for apps. \u201cIf you want your app to be surfaced, you have to pay for that real estate now.\u201d It has also helped that the company has increasingly been branded as one of the most trustworthy on data protection, and is not embroiled in controversy like many of its big-tech competitors. For years, Cook has criticized companies like Google and Facebook over their handling of consumer data, and called for more government oversight. It has been a winning way, positioning Apple as a leader on safety, solidifying mistrust of other companies and manifesting a regulatory environment that could cause headaches for other tech companies. In June, Apple ramped up data privacy efforts, restricting app developers\u2019 capabilities to collect data from iPhones. The move hit services like Onavo Project \u2013 a Facebook-owned data security app that promises protection while it feeds user information to its parent company\u2019s platform. In a keynote speech at an international conference on data privacy in October, Cook congratulated the European Union for cracking down on companies\u2019 use of consumer data, accusing other businesses of creating an environment where our data is \u201cweaponized against us\u201d, and called for the US to follow in the EU\u2019s footsteps. Earlier in the year, the CEO directly censured Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, warning that he believed privacy \u201cis a human right, a civil liberty\u201d and vowing that his company wouldn\u2019t monetize its customers as Facebook does. Cook\u2019s actions may help tackle the daunting data privacy issues he has raised, but they are also a boon for his business. A joint SurveyMonkey/Record poll in April found that Americans listed Apple among the most trusted companies in big tech. \u201cThis plays to Apple\u2019s strengths,\u201d Cridlin says, adding that a study his company conducted found that 80% of adults across the world care about the issue. But, he adds, the strong rhetoric from Apple\u2019s CEO will probably require the company to limit its ad offering to within Apple\u2019s own world of apps and products. \u201cThere are rumors that they have been exploring an ad network by partnering with folks like Pinterest, and Snapchat, and others,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce you do that, you open the data up to the wider platform. By keeping its ad offering, at least the way it is right now with consumer data all to itself, [Apple] can still wholly control it.\u201d If Apple doesn\u2019t expand its ads, though, the company\u2019s growth could come up against a wall. Much of Cook\u2019s criticism centers on how other companies handle data; it\u2019s still unclear how the company will better navigate the obstacles. \u201cAt that point it will be interesting,\u201d Cridlin says. \u201cWill they take a different stance so they can expand beyond their ecosystem, or not? Its stance on data privacy likely will be tested.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
