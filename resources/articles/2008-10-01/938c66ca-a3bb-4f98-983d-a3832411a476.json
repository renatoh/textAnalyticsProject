Now perhaps it is time for the boundaries of Russian song to be pushed back, too. And if anyone is going to make the sale it is surely the glamour combo of the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and pianist Evgeny Kissin. Hvorostovsky's Russian repertoire is vast and eclectic but here he concentrated on Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, as well as the latter's neglected contemporary Nikolai Medtner. And if the involvement of a prodigious pianist such as Kissin seemed a luxury in the all-Tchaikovsky first half, he was fully employed for the pyrotechnics of the two later composers. Tchaikovsky's Why?, set to Heine, set a high standard, with its carefully graded and long-spun vocal line providing a showcase for Hvorostovsky's mellow dark tones. The Love of a Dead Man, a Lermontov setting, was more melodramatic, full of the self-pity that can make the Russian song repertoire seem too unvarying. The lilting waltz Pimpinella, sung in Italian, offered a welcome lighter moment. In the Midst of the Ball, with its beguiling Onegin-like atmospherics, was the artistic highlight of this half. Medtner's songs have a wide emotional range. The swirling, stormy Winter Evening stood out, with Kissin providing a hair-raising accompaniment, as did Pushkin's To a Dreamer, a song of great drive with a bathetic close, while two demanding Goethe settings stretched even Hvorostovsky. The Rachmaninov songs provided a superb climax, with Koltsov's I Was With Her and the adaptation of Sonya's final speech from Chekhov's Uncle Vanya paving the way for the exuberance of Spring Waters to provide the barnstorming finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
