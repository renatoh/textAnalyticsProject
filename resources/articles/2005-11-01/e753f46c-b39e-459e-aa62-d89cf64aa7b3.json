Officials at Baghdad's Yarmouk hospital said four men and one woman, all Britons of south Asian origin, were brought in after the shooting at a checkpoint in the Dora district of the Iraqi capital. The British woman injured in the attack, who identified herself as Z Jafferti, said she had been ill and had gone to Iraq to pray at the shrines to Imam Ali and Imam Hussein in the holy cities of Najaf and Kerbala. \"We were just coming and all of a sudden heard shots and immediately got down,\" she told the Associated Press from hospital. \"I don't know what happened and I couldn't see anything.\" A Reuters cameraman at the Yarmouk hospital said the body of at least one British man had been brought in to the hospital. Hospital staff had a copy of the man's passport as well as of those of the other four Britons, reports said. The names of the five were not released. The attack came a day after it emerged that 74-year-old British peace campaigner Norman Kember, two Canadians and an American had been abducted in Iraq. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, today reiterated Foreign Office advice not to travel to Iraq. \"We issue very clear travel advice on the Foreign Office website which is that UK citizens should not travel to Iraq,\" he said at the Euromed summit in Barcelona. \"The only exceptions are where they are subject to proper security protection. That is clear, explicit. We hope British citizens will follow it, but we have no way of obliging British citizens to do so.\" A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Baghdad said consular and security staff were investigating reports that two Britions were killed in the shooting. \"We've heard that it could be two British nationals, but we know no more than that,\" she said. Shia Muslim civilians have increasingly become the targets of Sunni insurgents as sectarian tensions rise in Iraq. Twin suicide attacks on Shia mosques near the Iranian border earlier this month killed 77 people. The bombers struck at Friday prayers. Iraqi politics are divided along sectarian and ethnic lines, with the Shia Muslim and Kurdish majority now more powerful than the 20% Sunni population who were dominant under Saddam Hussein. Sir Iqbal Sacranie, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, told the Press Association that between 5,000 and 10,000 British Muslims made the pilgrimage to the Iraqi holy cities each year. \"The most important burial site is, of course, Medina where the Prophet himself is buried, then comes Mecca where many relatives of the Prophet are, and then, of course, come these sites in Iraq.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
