The ride-sharing company used Ripley at least two dozen times in 2015 and 2016 in countries including Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg. In one case Ripley was deployed to prevent Canadian tax investigators, who believed Uber had violated tax laws, from collecting evidence even though they had a warrant. As soon as they burst into the Montreal office, Uber staff paged the headquarters in San Francisco who remotely logged everyone in that office off their devices. Uber first developed the system, initially called the \u201cunexpected visitor protocol\u201d, after a police raid in its Brussels office, where Belgian law enforcement officers accessed the company\u2019s financial documents, payments system and worker data. A court order subsequently forced Uber to shut down its service for operating without proper licenses. It was nicknamed Ripley after a line spoken by the protagonist in the Alien movies, who decides that the only way to destroy all the murderous extraterrestrials is to destroy their entire habitat. \u201cI say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It\u2019s the only way to be sure,\u201d she says. The line has been reappropriated by information security teams to describe an extreme response to a detected threat. Uber downplayed the tool and said it was common practice to have such software to remotely change passwords or lock devices in the event they were lost or stolen. \u201cLike every company with offices around the world, we have security procedures in place to protect corporate and customer data,\u201d said an Uber spokeswoman. \u201cWhen it comes to government investigations, it\u2019s our policy to cooperate with all valid searches and requests for data. After the Montreal raid, a judge in the subsequent tax lawsuit wrote that Uber\u2019s actions showed \u201call the characteristics of an attempt to obstruct justice\u201d and that the company was trying to hide \u201cevidence of its illegal activities\u201d. Uber granted access to the relevant files once issued with a second, more specific search warrant. Albert Gidari, director of privacy at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet &amp; Society, added that companies often protect networks and computers against dawn raids where the scope of authority is in question and the data to be seized is in another jurisdiction. \u201cIf a company centralises its business data in country X and the authorities in country Y raid the local office and try to access that data through computers at employee desktops, that\u2019s a cross-border search,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also generally may permit access to areas and data not covered by any warrant.\u201d Ryan Kalember from cybersecurity firm Proofpoint added that although it is standard practice to be able to remotely lock all systems or wipe data from devices, it\u2019s less typical to develop a specific tool and to give it such an evocative name. \u201cThat\u2019s the only strange thing here to me,\u201d he said. Even so, Uber has a history of developing tools to evade regulators, some of which are facing criminal investigations in the United States. Federal investigators are looking into a tool called Greyball, which was used to ensure drivers wouldn\u2019t pick up law enforcement officials in cities where its service violated regulations and another code-named \u201cHell\u201d which was designed to track the drivers at rival Lyft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
