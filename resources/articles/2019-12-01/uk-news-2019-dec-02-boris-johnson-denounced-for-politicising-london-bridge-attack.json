Jack Merritt, 25, coordinator for Cambridge University\u2019s Learning Together initiative, which brings together offenders and those in higher education \u201cto study alongside each other\u201d, was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan on Friday, alongside 23-year-old Saskia Jones. In a powerful piece published in the Guardian on Monday, Dave Merritt tackled head on Johnson\u2019s response to the attack that took his son\u2019s life, writing: \u201cHe [Jack] would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against.\u201d Reacting to the article, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cThis morning I had the honour of meeting some of Jack\u2019s friends. They were in total shock about the loss of Jack, who was clearly a compassionate and principled young man. \u201cEverything I hear about him, from his friends and this powerful and humane article from his father David, shows his determination to confront hate and injustice in our society and help bring communities together. \u201cWe must learn from this tragedy and in Jack\u2019s memory, protect people from these terrorist horrors but also build a world of greater peace and understanding.\u201d The article prompted a wave of support on social media, with many hailing Merritt\u2019s bravery in the face of losing his son. And it increased the pressure on Johnson over his response to the attack, after he was widely criticised by experts and on social media for appearing to blame Labour for the killings. In the aftermath of the attack, which also injured three others, Johnson moved to blame sentencing regimes and automatic early release laws for the tragic incident. Johnson used a lengthy interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show to accuse Labour of responsibility for the early release of Khan and to pledge that serious offenders would not be released early in the future. On Monday, before the publication of Dave Merritt\u2019s article, Johnson insisted he felt \u201ca huge amount of sympathy\u201d for the bereaved families. But amid growing criticism of his stance, he added that he had been right to argue that the previous government\u2019s decisions were to blame, saying: \u201cI think any impartial assessment of the situation would concede that he was sentenced to a period in prison \u2013 16 years, plus five years on licence \u2013 and then was subject to automatic early release having served eight years altogether. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that was long enough in view of the gravity of his offence \u2013 which was to conspire to blow up the Stock Exchange and to cause other types of mayhem \u2013 and in view of the view that was taken of him by the initial sentencing judge, Judge Wilkie, and looking at what the judge had to say about him, it\u2019s clear he was viewed as a very serious threat.\u201d Ed Davey, the deputy Liberal Democrat leader, accused Johnson of failing to understand the reasons for the attack. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s distasteful attempt to politicise a national tragedy is compounded by the fact he didn\u2019t bother to properly understand the events that led to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a pattern of behaviour, not concerning himself with the details and displaying total disregard for the families and victims involved. The similarity to his approach to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family is striking. These are families experiencing the most awful situations and being utterly let down as Johnson blusters his way ill-prepared through his duties. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s arrogant and blundering attitude is unacceptable at the best of times, but at times like these it is appalling.\u201d Before the article was published, Johnson appeared to defend himself from accusations of using the deaths for political point scoring. Johnson told reporters: \u201cI want to try to turn people\u2019s lives around if you can. But you have to be realistic and what you must not have is a system of automatic early release and it was the automaticity that I\u2019m afraid let us down here, because in the end the law had no choice but to let him out and then to hope that things would turn out well. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was a reasonable expectation given what we knew about him.\u201d But his interpretation of what went wrong has been derided by experts in the criminal justice sector. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cMuch of the debate since has been distorted by the fact we are in the run-up to a general election. \u201cIt is right that there should be a full investigation into what happened. Any such investigation should consider systemic issues and not simply sentencing policy or the decisions of individuals. \u201cPrisons in England and Wales are overcrowded and face record levels of violence and human misery. The probation service also faces well-documented problems. For years the Howard League has warned that such pressure is unsustainable. \u201cThe answer does not lie in writing people off. The focus must be on safely fostering our human potential for change. \u201cIt lies in a criminal justice system \u2013 and a wider response from other public agencies \u2013 that looks to solve problems, rather than making them worse. Whoever forms the next government should make this a national priority.\u201d Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cAll our experience shows us that policy decisions taken in the immediate aftermath of shocking events are likely to lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences. \u201cIn criminal justice, those damaging consequences have sometimes lasted for many years, and done incalculable harm. \u201cWe do not know all of the facts about Friday\u2019s events and what led up to them. Attempting to draw conclusions in haste risks not only grave policy error, but also shows a lack of respect for those who have suffered most.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
