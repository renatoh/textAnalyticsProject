Michiel, a fresh-faced 14-year-old, yearns to join the resistance, stumbles across an injured British airman in a wood outside of town, and has to dodge the Germans to get food and medicine to the fugitive. Apparently it was a big Christmas hit in the Netherlands, and is entirely well-meaning \u2013 but it's all a little staid. Kids these days may demand a little more edge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
