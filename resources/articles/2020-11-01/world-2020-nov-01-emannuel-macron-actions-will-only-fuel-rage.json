France is now a deeply unsettled country, and Emmanuel Macron should seek to reassure his citizens. Instead, the president has ramped up tension by clashing with Islam in an attempt to make \u201cfear change sides\u201d. The French government has closed mosques, searched homes and shut down associations in a crackdown on radical Islamism that has inflamed moderate Muslims in this country and around the world. Religious tolerance is a cardinal indicator of a civilised society. Europeans have spent centuries telling others how to live, or interpret, their religion. Macron is stigmatising an entire faith based on the actions of a few violent extremists. It can have only one result \u2013 to fuel rage.
