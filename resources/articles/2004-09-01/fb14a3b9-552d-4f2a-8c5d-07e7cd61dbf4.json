The group, which runs more than 2,000 pubs including the O'Neills, Harvester and It's a Scream chains, said like-for-like sales for the 19 weeks to September were 6% ahead of the same period last year, though drinks growth had slowed to 5% because of poor weather. Chief executive Tim Clarke said M&amp;B expected to be hit with \u00a319m in increased overheads next year - most of which he linked to the rise in the minimum wage, which comes into force next month. But he expects the group to meet its trading expectations. Mr Clarke said that strong pricing pressure remained, particularly on the high street. He added that the government's position on smoking in public places was unclear and a cause for uncertainty. The group's strongest performance came from the Harvester, Toby and Vintage Inns pub restaurant chains. Its shares closed up 7.5p at 265p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
