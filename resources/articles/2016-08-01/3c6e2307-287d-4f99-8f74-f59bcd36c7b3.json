This thematically and stylistically wide-ranging collection of films reaches well above and beyond the widespread perception of the disco scene as a gaudy, lycra-slathered vessel for peppy escapism to explore its complicated relationship to gender, race, sexuality and memory. That\u2019s not to say it ignores disco\u2019s main draw: the music. Whether it\u2019s Summer\u2019s unbound performance of Last Dance in the LA-set rarity Thank God its Friday (1978), or John Travolta, as white-suited jiver Tony Manero, tearing it up to the Bee Gees\u2019 Stayin\u2019 Alive in the grittier-than-you-might remember Saturday Night Fever (1978). The centrepiece of and inspiration for the series is the new release of Derek Jarman\u2019s documentary Will You Dance With Me?, which was shot in 1984 and remained unseen until it was unearthed in 2014, some 20 years after the director\u2019s death. What Jarman captured doubles as an absorbing, evocative period piece. The footage was originally intended as a location test for a forthcoming film to be directed by Jarman\u2019s friend Ron Peck, who\u2019d debuted in 1978 with the quietly landmark film Nighthawks, which also screens here and was one of the first films to depict gay life in a non-sensationalist way. Shot on an Olympus camcorder at Benjy\u2019s nightclub in east London, Will You Dance With Me? is a grab bag of poses, halting chatter, dancing of unmistakable ambition but questionable quality, and (frequently stymied) attempts to get more than a smattering of people on the dance floor at any one point while the upbeat DJ spins an esoteric selection featuring Soul Sonic Force and the Pointer Sisters. The series is curated by Melissa Anderson, who is also a film critic for the Village Voice, and Am\u00e9lie Garin-Davet. Anderson first saw Will You Dance With Me? in the spring of 2015, and was seduced by its charms. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another film, whether fiction or nonfiction, that so perfectly captures the flow of a night at a queer club,\u201d she tells me via email. \u201cThe lulls and desultory conversation, the flirting and cruising, the anticipation of adventure (erotic or otherwise), the ecstasy of being one among many lost in the music.\u201d Meanwhile, in the light of the recent homophobic shooting of patrons at Florida\u2019s Pulse nightclub, Will You Dance With Me? carries an extra, poignant charge. It\u2019s a smeary, neon-streaked vision of a blessed safe space in all its placid mundanity, its flickering wavelengths of romantic hope and chance. Anderson concurs, citing the gay American writer Frank O\u2019Hara: \u201cAlmost 30 years before Jarman shot Will You Dance with Me?, O\u2019Hara beautifully illuminated the thrill and abandon of dancing in a gay bar in his 1955 poem At the Old Place. The refrain of the penultimate stanza is \u201c(It\u2019s heaven!)\u201d \u2013 a belief that many films in this retrospective bear out.\u201d The roots of such dreams are explored in Joesph Lovett\u2019s stylish and informative documentary Gay Sex in the 70s, which is composed of revealing first-person accounts of New York in the post-Stonewall, pre-Aids era. A bouncing disco soundtrack is the binding agent for myriad stories of wild times on the West Side piers, the Roman baths, and fabled New York dance spots like the Loft and Paradise Garage. One of the very best films in the programme is Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell, which documents the musician\u2019s immersion into the disco scene. Even though darkness is very much on the programme\u2019s agenda (see the inclusion of bleak psychological dramas Klute and Looking For Mr Goodbar), Dim All The Lights pointedly does not include William Friedkin\u2019s salacious Cruising (1980). This sordid S&amp;M serial killer-thriller starring a sweaty, leather-chapped Al Pacino still rankles for its curtain-twitching pathologising of homosexuality. It does, however, find space for Nancy Walker\u2019s Can\u2019t Stop the Music, an uproariously camp, massively fictionalised origin story of disco titans the Village People. The film, which incidentally edged out Cruising for the title of Worst Picture at the 1980 Golden Raspberry awards, features an early turn from Caitlyn Jenner, as a buttoned-up lawyer who ends up switching the office and polyester suit for the dance floor and a fetching denim shorts and crop top combo: an indelible image. I ask Anderson how she sees the diverse slate of films tying together. \u201cThey reflect the utopian promise of disco during a decade \u2013 the 1970s \u2013 that was defined by social and political advancements for marginalized groups,\u201d she says. \u201cDisco, as Alice Echols points out in her excellent 2010 study, Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture, not only integrated nightlife among races, but also played an enormous role in fostering the new relationship gay men had to public space, now that they were no longer prohibited from dancing together.\u201d Collectively, the films assume an affective, unexpectedly stately power: a multicultural, multi-gendered blast of inclusivity, and the excavation of a hope-filled past.
