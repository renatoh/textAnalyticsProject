Though Northern Ireland have made steady progress under Sanchez, suffering two defeats in 11 games, they have not won in front of their own supporters since 2001 when they thumped Iceland 3-0. Sanchez is nevertheless convinced his team are on the rise and has asked for a two-year extension to a contract due to expire at the end of the World Cup qualifiers. An offer has been made, and the situation is expected to be resolved before the next qualifier against England at Old Trafford on March 26. The IFA vice-president Raymond Kennedy said: \"We will be looking at his contract very shortly. Lawrie has helped raise our profile.\" Sanchez is expected to hand a first start tonight to the 20-year-old Aston Villa midfielder Steve Davis, who may be in contention for the England match. \"If Steve comes in and scores a hat-trick I don't think I could ignore that,\" said the manager. \"What I like about him is that he has not changed the way he plays in the first team. It is the same as if he is in the reserve or youth sides. \"We took him with us to Azerbaijan last year and since then he has gone on. He has great enthusiasm.\" The striker Andy Kirk is poised to win his sixth cap after a two-year absence. Kirk has scored 19 goals for the League Two side Boston, having left Hearts last May. Sanchez said: \"Andy took a step back but now he is in such good form that Championship sides are having a look at him. He deserves his call-up.\" Kirk looks likely to partner David Healy, the Leeds striker, having returned to training after a groin strain. Keith Gillespie and Mark Clyde also took part in training yesterday, leaving Sanchez with a clean bill of health. Canada are ranked 15 places above Northern Ireland at 95 in the Fifa rankings but their coach Frank Yallop will field an inexperienced side. The former Ipswich defender hands only a second start to the Montreal Impact goalkeeper Greg Sutton. The Hearts defender Kevin McKenna will captain the side, and Norwich City's midfielder Jim Brennan is also included. Yallop said: \"I am trying to give some players experience. I want to look at them under tough situations like this.\" Northern Ireland (probable): Taylor (Birmingham) or Carroll (Manchester United); Clyde (Wolves), Hughes (Newcastle), Murdock (Crewe), Capaldi (Plymouth), Gillespie (Leicester), Whitley (Sunderland), Davis (Aston Villa), Mulryne (Norwich), Healy (Preston), Kirk (Boston)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
