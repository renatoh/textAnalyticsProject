Matthew Healy, the band\u2019s frontman, told the Observer: \u201cYou might wonder why it is needed, and even ask yourself what exactly is everyone still scared of, but sadly, I think stigma still exists even in London and we still have some way to go.\u201d Healy, 29, added that he was surprised to find the capital city did not have a place for LGBTQ+ people to meet and support one another. New York, Berlin, Los Angeles and Manchester already have such venues \u2013 and London did once. A Gay and Lesbian Centre in Farringdon was shut down in the early 1990s, because of a lack of funding and management disagreements about its core purpose. But now a team of volunteers, including the activist and journalist Michael Segalov, are attempting to set up a new and more welcoming place for London\u2019s large LGBTQ+ community that could have a more stable future. Segalov, too, had assumed that Londoners in need of friendship, or a safe space to escape from prejudice, already had somewhere to go. The fundraising campaign won support from Hackney Council, the borough that will host the planned centre, and then from the London mayor\u2019s office. Money-raising events, ranging from club nights to community picnics, got the project off the ground, but it was Healy and his band\u2019s 11th-hour response to the project\u2019s appeal to raise \u00a350,000 that has now enabled the creation of the centre. \u201cWhen a friend of mine sent me the link, I was quite surprised that such a good idea had not yet raised enough to get over the threshold,\u201d said Healy, the son of actors Tim Healy and Denise Welch. \u201cI am a bit wary of talking about it because I don\u2019t want to appear to be virtue-signalling, but me and the others in the band all felt it was obviously a good thing to put our money towards.\u201d The musicians, who formed a group in 2002 while at school in Wilmslow and won the Brit award last year for best British band, are currently in the studio working on a third album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. In 2013, their debut album went to the top of the UK album chart. In 2016, their second album topped both the UK chart and the US Billboard 200. Yesterday, Healy said a large section of the 1975\u2019s fanbase comes from the LGBTQ+ community so the decision to fund the centre had seemed a natural choice. \u201cAside from believing in the idea, a more superficial reason is that one of our songs, Loving Someone, has become a bit of an anthem for some people in that community,\u201d he said. The new venue will host a wide variety of entertainment and group activities, from drag shows to Christmas dinners for the lonely. Key to its purpose will be welcoming older members, who are sometimes left out, and holding events that do not revolve around alcohol. The centre plans to run a cafe employing LGBTQ+ people, as well as an information and research hub. Three full-time official posts will run the operation, with new personnel selected each year. \u201cThe fundamental aim is setting up the centre,\u201d explains Segalov, adding the team has now set the online fundraising target to \u00a3100,000. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about bringing together a community that can be disparate. We\u2019re trying to bridge those gaps.\u201d More than half of London\u2019s established bars, clubs and pubs set up for the LGBTQ+ community have closed in the last decade, many of them victims of rising business rates and rents. At the same time, concerns about public safety among this community have grown. A recent YouGov national survey of 5,000 people suggested that in the last five years, verbal or physical attacks on LGBTQ+ people have increased by almost 80%. Research conducted by the Albert Kennedy Trust also found that 24% of homeless young people identify as LGBTQ+."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
