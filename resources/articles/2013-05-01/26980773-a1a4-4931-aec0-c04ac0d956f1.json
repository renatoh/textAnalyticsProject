Barack Obama, talking to the press alongside Thein Sein, acknowledged the human rights abuses but also praised him for the progress he had made towards democracy in the last two years. In a symbolic moment, Obama became the first US president to talk about Myanmar rather than Burma. The US has long resisted the change, in part because of pressure from opposition groups and human rights organisations who said Myanmar was a name used by the military junta and was not inclusive of all the country's ethnic groupings, unlike Burma. Earlier, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, anticipating the use of Myanmar, said it was not a change in policy by the US, which continued to view the name of the country as Burma, and there were no plans to officially adopt Myanmar. But there were times when its use as a courtesy was appropriate in certain settings, Carney said. The visit underlines the extent to which Burma's status has changed. Two years ago it was still viewed as an international pariah, run by a military junta. Since then, there has been a partial transfer to civilian rule, with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi being allowed to enter parliament and the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Obama, anxious to encourage reform and trade, visited Burma in November. It has been one of his few foreign policy successes, courting the country and shifting it away from China's sphere of influence. Thein Sein was until September last year on a US blacklist that would have prevented entry to the country. It is the first visit by a leader from Burma since Ne Win in 1966. Ne Win led the coup that established military rule in 1962. Obama praised Thein Sein for making a start towards establishing a democracy. \"We've seen credible elections and a legislature that is continuing to make strides in more inclusivity and greater representation of all the various ethnic groups in Myanmar,\" he said, adding that Thein Sein would be the first to admit it was a long journey and \"there is still much work to be done\". Obama said that Sein shared with him that he planned to release more political prisoners. Thein Sein told journalists: \"For democracy to flourish, we will have to undertake more economic and political reforms in the years ahead \u2026 and will need the assistance and understanding of the international community, including the US.\" Obama did not duck the human rights complaints. He said he had discussed with the Burmese president \"our deep concerns about the communal violence directed at Muslim communities inside Myanmar. The displacement of people, the violence towards them needs to stop.\" Brianna Oliver, a spokeswoman for the US Campaign for Burma, which organised protests to coincide with Thein Sein's visit, said: \"We believe that President Obama has been giving way too many concessions to the Burmese government. We are seeing sanctions being lifted and we are seriously concerned about the ethnic cleansing and human rights.\" She said the use of Myanmar was significant because Burma had been completely respectful to the rest of the union whereas Myanmar, the name used by the regime, had not been all-inclusive. \"It is very unfortunate for President Obama to concede this,\" Oliver said. Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, released a report on Monday detailing attacks against Muslims that took place in central Myanmar in late March which it said resulted in the deaths of at least 20 children and four teachers. The report said state authorities stood by watching the events unfold and were complicit in these crimes. \"President Obama must use this occasion to persuade Burma's leader that the only path from tyranny to democracy is through the promotion and respect of human rights,\" said Richard Sollom, the report's lead author and PHR's director of emergencies. \"One concrete step toward this goal is for President Thein Sein to support an independent investigation into these killings, bring perpetrators to justice, and speak out forcefully against ongoing anti-Muslim violence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
