In a strongly-worded lecture, which he will deliver at the annual Prix Italia awards on Tuesday, the veteran broadcaster accuses the Sun in particular of cynically misrepresenting the corporation to its readers because of its \u201cvested financial interest in reducing the BBC\u2019s scope and influence\u201d. The 71-year-old \u2013 the son of BBC stalwart Richard Dimbleby and brother of presenter David \u2013 will say that his employer faces an \u201cera of extraordinary uncertainty\u201d. In a broad-ranging speech seen, Dimbleby attacks opponents of free speech around the world and claims the BBC is one of the best defences against propaganda and falsehood in the internet age. He also criticises its \u201cideological opponents\u201d on the Conservative backbenches, claiming that culture secretary John Whittingdale has an \u201cagenda\u201d to cut the BBC down. But he reserves his strongest words for the BBC\u2019s \u201cenemies in the media\u201d, in particular Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper stable of the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun. He will say: \u201cPrinciple among these [enemies] \u2013 but not alone \u2013 is News UK, which is owned by News Corp, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox, which, in case you wondered, is the parent company of Sky.\u201d Dimbleby is set to claim Murdoch\u2019s newspapers deliberately exaggerate and invent BBC \u201cscandals\u201d by drumming up fake controversy with the help of Conservative MPs. He says the row over the BBC\u2019s decision to broadcast an episode of Songs of Praise from the migrant camp in Calais last month was an example of such biased reporting. He says: \u201cUnder the banner headline \u2018Hymnigrants \u2013 BBC BLASTED\u2019, the Sun reported: \u2018BBC Chiefs spark outrage\u2019. \u201cFurther down, it cited its source for the alleged \u2018outrage\u2019 \u2013 its only source: a Conservative backbencher. \u201cNever mind that the Archbishop of Canterbury welcomed the fact that Songs of Praise was to celebrate the \u2018love of Christ\u2019 in a makeshift Ethiopian church. \u201cOr that the programme contained no political content. The Sun\u2019s message was clear: the BBC is run by a bunch of lefties who are soft on immigration.\u201d Dimbleby will suggest the main reason for News UK\u2019s hostility to the BBC is commercial rather than ideological. He says: \u201cNews Corp and its ilk have a vested financial interest in reducing the BBC\u2019s scope and influence in the hope that the edifice will tumble leaving a gaping hole in the market for them to fill. \u201cThey and their cronies in Westminster care not a jot for balance or fairness but are doing their best to shape the outcome of the negotiations over the renewal of the BBC\u2019s charter \u2013 effectively its license to broadcast.\u201d Dimbleby will also hit out at Whittingdale, who published a green paper on the BBC in July. He will claim that the culture secretary has an anti-BBC agenda and that his panel of eight people to advise him on BBC charter renewal \u201chave vested interests or roles in the media or private sector\u201d. Dimbleby will assert that reducing the scope of the BBC to just a few genres such as news and drama would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d, adding: \u201cIt would tailspin down into a broadcasting vortex.\u201d Elsewhere in his lecture, Dimbleby is set to claim that the West faces an \u201cinsidious and growing\u201d threat to free speech. He will attack laws that seek to curb the freedom of expression, including the UK\u2019s Public Order Act, and criticises University College London for pressuring Nobel-winning scientist Sir Tim Hunt to resign after making an apparently sexist joke. Dimbleby resigned his honorary fellowship at the university in June over its treatment of the biologist, who prompted a Twitter backlash when he suggested women shouldn\u2019t work with men in the laboratory because they fall in love and cry. Although it later emerged his comments were intended to be tongue in cheek, his resignation was accepted by UCL\u2019s governing body. In his speech, Dimbleby will accept Sir Tim\u2019s comments were a \u201cbad joke\u201d, but will say he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the university\u2019s \u201ccraven disregard for justice and fairness\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
