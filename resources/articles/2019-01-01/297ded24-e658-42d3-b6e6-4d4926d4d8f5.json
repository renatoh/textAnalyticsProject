The Everton manager delivered an impassioned response on Friday to the majority shareholder\u2019s comment, made at the club\u2019s general meeting on Tuesday, that 11th in the Premier League is not good enough. Silva argued that Moshiri\u2019s assessment was taken out of context, with the billionaire also saying the manager retained the board\u2019s total support following a poor run of one win in eight league games. But he insists Moshiri\u2019s ambitions and demands are no different from his own, and there must be realism about the challenges Everton face to compete alongside the leading pack in the Premier League. \u201cI know what he thinks about the club and he knows my opinion about the club also,\u201d said Silva. \u201cI know what he asked me to do when I joined. It is not something that can be done in six months because that would not make sense. I did not come here to be a magician. That is not for me. I am a manager and when I came in we had many, many things to change to achieve something in the future. I am sure step by step, with some stability and doing the right things like we did we will achieve that.\u201d Silva is Everton\u2019s fourth permanent manager since Moshiri bought an initial 49.9% stake in the club almost three years ago. The high managerial turnover, he maintains, is no concern despite recent poor performances and results. He added: \u201cI understand your curiosity about this situation. What I can tell you about my relationship with our owner, with our chairman [Bill Kenwright] and all the structure of the club is very, very good. I\u2019m not here to make statements about what the club did in the past with one or three managers. I did my homework before I came here and now I am more ready and able to speak about everything at Everton. \u201cWe as a club need patience and we need stability. You cannot change the mood so easy that if we achieve fantastic form you are the best team in the Premier League and after if you don\u2019t have good form in the last four or five games it looks like you are the worst team in the Premier League. We are not the worst team. I know the club and one of the things our club needs apart from quality, good players, a good manager and ambition is some stability.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
