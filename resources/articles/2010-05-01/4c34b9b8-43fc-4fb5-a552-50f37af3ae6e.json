Newlove, from Warrington, Cheshire, has campaigned against drink-related violence since her husband's murder and launched the National Licensed Trade Association this year. The association, which Newlove chairs, aims to use campaigns, education and training for landlords and bar staff to help stop binge drinking. Her 47-year-old husband was kicked and beaten to death when he challenged a group of teenagers who had vandalised vehicles outside his home on 10 August 2007. Jordan Cunliffe, Stephen Sorton and Adam Swellings were convicted the following year of murdering the father-of-three. They were 16, 17 and 19 respectively when convicted. Swellings, had only been released from custody on the day of the attack, with one of his bail conditions being that he did not go to Warrington. Garry Newlove's eldest daughter Zoe witnessed the attack and told the court that her father's assailants were kicking him \"like you'd kick a football\". The teenagers had been drinking before attacking him and the case prompted calls for the government to help crack down on Britain's drinking culture and tackle perceived widespread anti-social behaviour. The then chief constable of Cheshire, Peter Fahy, called for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21 to combat the \"scourge of antisocial behaviour by young people\". David Cameron highlighted the case, while in opposition, as evidence of the \"anarchy in parts of the UK\" and promised to tackle \"broken Britain\" if elected. One of the steps the Tories said they would take would be to ensure tougher enforcement of underage drinking laws. Newlove, who has expressed her support for restoration of the death penalty, joined Cameron on the election trail as he visited a youth club in Bolton last month. She said of the Tory leader: \"I am impressed by David Cameron the person, not the politician. He is a good person.\" She is expected to be one of the peers created by the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition to \"balance\" the House of Lords so it better reflects the share of votes won in this month's election. At present there are 207 Labour peers, 140 Conservative and 67 Liberal Democrats. Conservative sources declined to confirm reports that she would be rewarded for her campaigning with a peerage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
