He is right to say that vouchers are only being used for asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected; but ignores why they were scrapped originally. The current bill enshrines vouchers back into law and rules out any chance of using cash, even for the small essential needs he describes. For the sake of sounding tough, the government is bringing back a discredited and harmful system. And his civil servants must be groaning at the unnecessary expense of trying to administer vouchers. We ask him to look at this issue again, and realise that \u00a335 a week cash given to asylum seekers, who have already signed up to return home, is not going to be an incentive for more asylum seekers to come here. It's merely the right thing to do. Anna Reisenberger Refugee Council"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
