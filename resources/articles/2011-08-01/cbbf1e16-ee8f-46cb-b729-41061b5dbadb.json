Boy 1 (running full pelt down the aisle toward a pair of seats with a table and throwing himself down) \"Here! Here!\" Boy 2 (joining him seconds later, then reaching an uncomfortable conclusion) \"It's wet.\" Boy 1 \"So's this one.\" Boy 2 (not to be outdone) \"This one's wetter.\" Boys 1 &amp; 2 (prepared to overlook their discomfort when it became apparent their mother and brother might take seats across the aisle) \"Can we sit here?\" Mother \"Yeah\" Boys 1&amp; 2 \"Thanks\" Mother (settling in, then realising that the two other kids were able to exploit a blind spot in her vision) \"Get over here.\" Boys 1 &amp; 2 \"But \u2026\" Mother \"Now!\" Boy 1 (having trapped his brother in the window seat) \"If you need to go to the toilet I ain't moving. [Pausing for thought] Where is the toilet?\" Boy 2 (instigating an exchange of dead arms) \"You should have gone.\" Boy 3 (staring at a DVD case of the movie Speed, as though it might somehow begin to play on its own.) \"Mum, how do you do this?\" Boy 1 \"Stupid kid.\" Boy 3 \"I'm not a kid I'm an adult.\" Mum (with authority that seemed to admonish the entire train) \"ENOUGH!\" The boys just stared each other out, wondering who would make the next move."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
