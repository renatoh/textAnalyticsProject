The Philadelphia police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, said the release of the footage on Wednesday night marked the first time in the department\u2019s history that it had done so. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, she said the two officers responsible for the shooting were Sean Matarazzo, 25, and Thomas Munz, 26. She said the officers, both of the 18th district, had been with the department since 2018 and 2017, respectively. \u201cWhile this is not a milestone to be celebrated, we truly believe that this is an important step in our commitment to transparency,\u201d Outlaw said, speaking alongside the mayor, Jim Kenney, and district attorney, Larry Krasner. \u201cThe release of this footage has been very carefully considered, with the safety of the officers and the community in mind.\u201d The distressing footage, taken from each of the officers\u2019 body cameras, shows them approaching Wallace\u2019s doorstep and shouting \u201cput the knife down now\u201d and pointing a gun at Wallace, after he appears carrying a knife. Within seconds, multiple gunshots are audible as Wallace falls to the ground in the street, prompting screams and commotion. In one of the videos, one of the officers is heard instructing the other to shoot. It comes nine days after Wallace, a 27-year-old Black man, was killed outside his home in West Philadelphia by police after his family said they called 911 for an ambulance. They said Wallace had bipolar disorder and was experiencing a mental health crisis at the time. The incident, which was also recorded by a witness in a video that has been viewed widely online, prompted protests in Philadelphia and other US cities, as police admitted they do not have the right resources to handle mental health problems. Outlaw said the videos show the officers\u2019 arrival on the scene, through to their interactions with Wallace up to the point where they took him to the hospital. She also announced a series of police reform initiatives \u2013 including a training programme for 911 dispatchers to better identify people in crisis, implicit bias training and active bystandership training for officers \u2013 and said they were working with the department of behavioral health. \u201cWithout a doubt the past nine days have been very difficult for all Philadelphians,\u201d she said. The fatal incident is currently under two investigations \u2013 one by the district attorney\u2019s office and one by the force\u2019s internal affairs unit. The announcement comes at a time of heightened tensions in the city, as mail-in votes are counted for the presidential election, and following unrest after Wallace\u2019s killing. Soon after the announcement, there were reports of two protests \u2013 one urging authorities to \u201ccount every vote\u201d, while racial justice protesters also gathered. Kenney said releasing the footage was an \u201cimportant step\u201d but called for patience from the public while investigations are under way. Calling for calm, he said: \u201cWe understand that the materials released today will be very painful. It will elicit anger, rage, distress, evoke more questions and rightfully so \u2026 But nothing is solved with more destruction and harm to our communities, neighborhoods and local businesses in the process.\u201d He added: \u201cWe know this moment is incredibly painful, given so many failures over generations to protect all of Philadelphia\u2019s residents, especially those who are Black or brown \u2026 releasing this footage is a step, but also an indication of this failure.\u201d Warning that \u201cthe stakes are very high and the world is watching\u201d, he promised the city would change. \u201cAll of it will ensure that the tragic death of Walter Wallace Jr will not be in vain. We will learn from our failings and we will do better.\u201d The decision comes after officials said last week in a joint statement with the Wallace family, who have already seen the footage, that they had agreed to release the footage by the end of Wednesday \u201cin the best interest of our city and its residents\u201d. After viewing the footage, Wallace family attorney, Shaka Johnson, said on Thursday that it showed a person in \u201cobvious mental health crisis\u201d and an officer telling the other to \u201cshoot him\u201d before they both opened fire and shot at him 14 times. He said it also shows chaotic scenes in which onlookers, including Wallace Jr\u2019s wife and mother, alerted Philadelphia police to his mental state and pleaded with them not to shoot. Johnson said Wallace was almost immediately incapacitated after the first shot by police, who were positioned \u201capproximately a car length and a half\u201d away from the victim. \u201cWhat, other than death, did you intend when you shoot a man, each officer, seven times apiece?\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon, attended by Wallace Jr\u2019s mother, Kathy Brant, and his father, Walter Wallace Sr. \u201cI saw a person in obvious mental health crisis. My auditory senses heard people shouting, \u2018He\u2019s mental, he\u2019s mental,\u2019\u201d said Johnson of the 30-40 second video. While Johnson said Wallace was holding a knife, it \u201cdoes not give you carte blanche to execute a man\u201d. Although Wallace\u2019s family believe they have been failed by the city, they are not calling for police officers to be charged with murder, Johnson said. \u201cHere\u2019s why: they were improperly trained and did not have the proper equipment by which to effectuate their job,\u201d he said. The officers did not have Taser stun guns, police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, has said. Johnson said Wallace\u2019s funeral has been scheduled for Saturday 7 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
