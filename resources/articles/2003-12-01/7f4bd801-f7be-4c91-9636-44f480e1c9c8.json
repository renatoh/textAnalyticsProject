They asked me whether I would consider working for them. Four interviews and a presentation later, I'd got the job. I've been here six years. I started working as a researcher for Austin Benn's executive search division, which meant head-hunting people. A senior colleague would source the work from large companies, and I would find and contact people we knew that would do well in that position, with a view to luring them away from their employer. It was a good introduction to the business. After three years I was promoted to my current role as consultant. I now specialise in finding sales staff for companies all over the north of England. As such I'm responsible for bringing work into the company, and then managing the recruitment process right through to the point where the candidate signs on the dotted line. A lot of my time is spent selling services to clients, which can either mean long telephone conversations or a visit to their premises. Once I'm absolutely clear in my own mind what the company is after, I go back to our database of people and start looking for candidates that match their criteria. I advertise positions both on the internet and in local and national newspapers. I also do a lot of interviewing - almost every day at some point - and although I'm looking for a proven track record in selling, I'm looking for the candidates to sell themselves to me. Once I have a shortlist of around four very good candidates, I put them before the client. Again, I'm involved in the client's interviewing process and will be there for as many interviews as they want to undertake. To those who are unsuccessful, I try to feed back the reason or reasons that they were not offered the job. The thing I always say to the interviewees is that they have to close the interview - that is, ask for the job in the same way that they would close a sale. Because it's a very competitive field, and because the company only gets paid if a candidate that we put forward is taken on, it's a pressured job, but I really enjoy it. The hours are often long, but it's varied work, and it helps that we are on open-ended commission. The more business we bring into the company, the more we earn - it makes the hard work worthwhile. Your candidate might get pipped to the post by another from a rival agency, but you quickly learn to get over it, and you immediately focus on the next. Although I'm happy staying where I am for now, I am ambitious to keep moving up the organisation. When the right position becomes available I'll know when I'm ready. miles.brignall@tiscali.fr"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
