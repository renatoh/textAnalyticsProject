He also ridiculed the suggestion, put forward by many Tory candidates, that it was possible to leave the EU on 31 October, saying they were hoping for a miracle that was not going to happen. Britain\u2019s fate after Brexit depended on the standing of its next prime minister, including whether they were respected internationally and wanted to have a global perspective, rather than just represent a faction, he said. Boris Johnson, the leading contender to replace Theresa May, has refused to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament. The former prime minister, speaking at Chatham House, said: \u201cWhen you have people suggesting that you prorogue parliament because parliament may take a different view from a particular faction in the House of Commons you are heading in very dangerous territory. \u201cWhen you look back at British history, you cannot image Disraeli, Gladstone, Churchill or Thatcher, even in their most difficult period, saying \u2018let us put parliament aside while I carry through this difficult policy\u2019 \u2026 it is fundamentally unconstitutional \u2026 and to hear that argument come from the people who in the Brexit debate talked about parliamentary sovereignty being at stake, it is not just fundamentally distasteful, it is hypocrisy on a gold-plated standard.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that can possibly be allowed to stand. I don\u2019t think the House of Commons will allow it to stand. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who proposes that, or even let it flit through their mind for a second, has any understanding of what parliament is about, what sovereignty is about, what leadership is about, or what the UK is about and the sooner the House of Commons stamps on the idea absolutely, comprehensibly and forever, the better.\u201d Asked if the next prime minister could implement Brexit by 31 October \u2013 with many Tory leadership hopefuls, including Johnson, ruling out any attempt to seek an extension \u2013 Major said: \u201cThose people who are suggesting that it can be done have their fingers crossed behind their back, whistling gently into the wind and hoping for some miracle where it might be possible.\u201d He said the false promises would only lead to future further disillusionment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
