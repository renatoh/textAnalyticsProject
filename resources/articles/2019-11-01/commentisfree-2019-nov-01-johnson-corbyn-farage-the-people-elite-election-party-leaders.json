This could end badly", "bodyText": "Imagine our collective surprise to wake up today and discover that prime minister Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t deceased in a ditch. And yet, we hadn\u2019t left the EU, as he promised, on 31 October, no ifs or buts. Like so many of Johnson\u2019s vows, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d bluster that it was true when he made it. Alas, as predicted, vast numbers of Britons took to the streets. On the night of 31 October, I myself beheld scores \u2013 perhaps hundreds \u2013 of small, black-clad and increasingly deranged beings roaming around house-to-house making demands. Antifa? Black bloc? I\u2019m hoping to read a measured analysis in the Daily Telegraph of why they\u2019ll destroy us all if they don\u2019t get whatever it is they want. This is what happens when Brexit doesn\u2019t happen when Brexiteers claim it\u2019s going to happen, and the fear of it happening if we don\u2019t \u201cget Brexit done\u201d will be weaponised by a series of absolute weapons in the coming weeks. But what of undead PM Boris Johnson, who seems to have shunned the privations of the ditch for the plush leather backseat of a prime ministerial limo. Here, he could be found recording a campaign video in which he promised do some other shit (I paraphrase very lightly). Johnson\u2019s election videos now finish with a shot of his signature, which is possibly supposed to serve as some kind of Kitemark. Shitemark feels more accurate, given his record. Only hours later, meanwhile, Nigel Farage took to a stage to offer Johnson an electoral pact with his Brexit party. \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable man,\u201d Nigel explained, deploying the precise cliche spouted by extremely unreasonable movie villains, right before they threaten to kill everyone you love or stand in constituencies across Wearside. Anyway, this incendiary press conference took place at London\u2019s Emmanuel Centre, the exact venue I watched Nigel resign as Ukip leader 10 days after the EU referendum. I wonder what keeps drawing him back to this place, other than the huge inscription on the wall reading \u201cTHOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME\u201d. On the day of that 2016 resignation speech, a Daily Telegraph columnist by the name of Boris Johnson wrote that David Cameron needed a plan to stop the political \u201cDiana moment\u201d that was the immediate aftermath of the referendum. Having Googled, I see I described this as \u201ca bit like the drunk chauffeur and 15 French paparazzi demanding to know why the Queen is still at Balmoral\u201d. I\u2019m not quite sure what the analogy is for where we currently find ourselves in 2019, other than to observe mildly that the exhumed chauffeur is now world king. Arguably the most excruciating aspects of Farage\u2019s press conference were his attempts at playing it cool about the phone sex he had with Donald Trump live on LBC last night. He never actually named the US president, preferring instead such gossamer touches as \u201cto quote a friend of mine\u201d, or \u201cI was speaking to an American friend of mine last night\u201d. Speaking of this American friend, it was hard not to think of him at Labour\u2019s launch the day before, when Jeremy Corbyn smirked: \u201cI ask our media, as good journalists, to just report what we say.\u201d For all that Corbyn\u2019s approach differs from that of the US president, his invited supporters got precisely the same message as they might from Trump, and dutifully booed the political editors of the BBC and Sky the minute they stood up to ask questions. In fact, it has been rather difficult not to think of Nigel\u2019s American friend all week, given that Johnson is pushing a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, while Corbyn is pushing for \u201cpeople versus the elites\u201d. Both of these are explicitly populist positions, with both the main party leaders claiming to speak for \u201cthe people\u201d, an apparently homogenised mass being held back by an elite establishment that doesn\u2019t include themselves. We might well be so far gone as a country not to notice this any more, but this should be a major alarm bell. Every single person buying into this \u201cpeople versus \u2013\u201d stuff, on either side, should be extremely careful. Populism, whether left or right, always ends badly. Honestly, what are the great populist success stories? Apart from Daenerys Targaryen. Oh, wait \u2026 But honestly: where in the world is it really working out harmoniously for the people governed by these guys? The rightwing horror stories from the Philippines to Brazil barely need rehashing. But \u2013 and apologies for lapsing into political technicalese \u2013 the ones on the left all turn out to be divisive shits, too. Once leftwingers couldn\u2019t eulogise Venezuela any more, their fandom transferred to Evo Morales in Bolivia. Forgive the spoilers, but if you\u2019re keeping up with the show you\u2019ll note that Evo has since trampled over liberal democracy, and Bolivia is this week mired in violent political protests amid claims he rigged the election. There are many Corbyn supporters who believe that the only way to defeat right populism is with left populism. But on what evidence? Among those who seriously study the rise of the radical and far right, this is not widely concluded to be the case. Political scientist Cas Mudde, an expert in this field, stresses that neither \u201cthe people\u201d nor \u201cthe elite\u201d should ever be homogenised and essentialised, and that \u201cpoliticians have to stop pretending to speak for \u2018the people\u2019\u201d. Our societies are pluralist, and much more complex than such dangerous simplification allows. Or as Farage put it this week: \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the establishment.\u201d Or as Corbyn put it this week: \u201cWe will take on the establishment.\u201d Or as Boris Johnson has put it: \u201cWe are the party of the people.\u201d Or as Corbyn now prefers it: Labour is \u201cthe true party of the people\u201d. Clearly, some of these claims are more credible or lunatic than others \u2026 and yet. Before the election is even formally under way, we have already seen three avowedly populist party leaders fighting over ownership of terms such as \u201cthe elite\u201d, \u201cthe establishment\u201d and \u201cthe people\u201d. What could possibly go wrong? One way or another, we seem fated to find out. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
