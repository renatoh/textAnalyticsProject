I'm also the lead verifier, so I have a direct role in the formulation of policy. All in all, it's quite a challenging post. The part I most enjoy is the teaching. I love taking students through the whole experience of land management, giving them the conservation angle and dispelling myths. It's great when students get the jobs they want at the end of the course. They might become a National Trust warden or the estate manager for their father's property, but they're all leaving with the conservation message, which is what it's all about. The courses I teach are a national certificate in countryside management and level 4 professional diplomas. I like the mix of level 3 (A-level level) and level 4 (degree level). I also teach a one-day part-time course in estate skills and countryside crafts, which is about managing the countryside traditionally, using methods and techniques that were employed before intensive agriculture. It's about bringing back the old ways and emphasising the need we have for them now, because of the mistakes that have been made through the intensification of land. That's what really floats my boat and it's what I've been concentrating on for the past 10 years or so. It's a real passion for me - I'm the boring old sod you meet at dinner parties who wants to talk about hedge-laying. There is quite a small number of staff on the campus and we're all very close. The camaraderie is incredibly strong and it's what makes Merrist Wood so special. It's been a tough year for us because we merged with Guildford College and had to sort out policies and procedures. I can already see that next year is looking better, though. We've got a strong senior management representing Merrist Wood, so I'm sure we'll do well. I'm definitely planning to stay. As long as I'm teaching I'm happy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
