And you can relive Sid Lowe\u2019s take on Messi\u2019s exploits at the weekend \u2026 Here\u2019s a bit of what Messi had to say on stage. He spoke for quite a while. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Didier Drogba by words of encouragement but the little man ought to be used to all this by now. To the journalists and my colleagues with whom I win and lose, I remember my first Ballon D\u2019Or in Paris, when I arrived with my brothers, now I pick up the sixth, and this was absolutely unthinkable. I never stopped dreaming and enjoying football like when I was a child. I hope I have more years to enjoy, although I am aware of how old I am, everything happens very quickly and I know that the moment of withdrawal (retirement) is approaching. It\u2019s a funny old game. Van Dijk doesn\u2019t look too disappointed and he explains why: \u201cI had a great season, but sometimes you come up against players like him [Messi], who are a bit unnatural. Six Ballon d\u2019Ors, you gotta respect greatness. I was close, but I lost out to someone better.\u201d Here\u2019s the top four. And Messi at the summit. Sid Lowe paid glowing tribute to the continuing brilliance of Messi in this week\u2019s blog from La Liga. Cristiano, at this point, has probably switched over to Coronation Street. The count-back was: Sadio Man\u00e9 in fourth, Cristiano Ronaldo in third (!) and Virgil van Dijk second. This might be the last time he wins this award, but perhaps the crowning achievement since there may not be any way back for Ronaldo. \u201cThank you to my colleagues from my club,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d Messi enjoyed that show, which included a message from his wife and three kids. And out comes Luka Modric to pass over the gong itself. Here is the moment of truth as it happened. Didier Drogba sits Messi down in a director\u2019s chair and they go through the year\u2019s highlights and a video package that includes Messi at home in one of those subterranean homes with no lights the top stars they all appear to live in. A double hat-trick of wins for him and he overtakes Ronaldo, back on five and coming up on 35. Here we go for the final four...Didier Drogba has the envelope in his hand. Great achievement for Lucy Bronze. Phil Neville thinks she\u2019s the best and he was almost proved right. While we wait for the big reveal, how about The Guardian\u2019s own awards season? That leaves Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Man\u00e9, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the final four. There\u2019s no sign of Ronaldo, and it\u2019s not like him to not show up and support his fellow pros. Big chance there will be no Ron and two Liverpool players in the top three. Lucy Bronze came second with Alex Morgan of the USA third in the women\u2019s award. Some words from Megan Rapinoe. It\u2019s a bummer [not to be there]. I congratulate all the nominees, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the one winning it. I want to thank my teammates, my coaches, my federation, to allow to be the person who I am on the field and off the field. Thank you to my beautiful girlfriend Sue. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t be there, I know it\u2019s going to be insane but I\u2019ll do my best to get back there next year. The men\u2019s countdown continues with Mbapp\u00e9 in sixth. She can\u2019t be there, but delivers a video message, as does her mum and twin sister, in a video package that tells the story of someone who became a global figure in 2019. Donald Trump\u2019s congratulations are in the post, no doubt. Now for the women. Here\u2019s the top ten. Miedema Lavelle White Kerr Renard Marozsan Rapinoe Morgan Bronze Hegerberg The men\u2019s countdown continues: Alisson 7th \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour,\u201d he says. \u201cI am blessed and grateful.\u201d Mrs Becker looks very happy, too. Here\u2019s the podium. Robert Lewandowski is on stage to present the Yachine award for the goalkeepers. He and Drogba enjoy some striker banter on stage before the big reveal. Alisson (Liverpool and Brazil) Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) Ederson (Manchester City and Brazil) Andre Onana (Ajax and Cameroon) Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus and Poland) Jan Oblak (Atletico Madrid and Slovenia) Kepa (Chelsea and Spain) Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia) Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France) Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany) We are counting down the men\u2019s winners\u2019 top ten from 10-8 - they are the Manchester City pair of Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva in 10th and 9th and in 8th is Bayern Munich goal machine Robert Lewandowski. He thanks his old club Ajax and his family and girlfriend and says of Messi and Ronaldo that we must enjoy them when we can. Mbapp\u00e9 is the current holder of the Kopa Trophy, the award that is now to be presented. These are the nominees: Samuel Chukwueze (Villarreal) Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix (Atletico Madrid) Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior (Real Madrid) Lee Kang-in (Valencia) Andriy Lunin (Real Valladolid) Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund) Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi (Arsenal) Moise Kean (Everton) Matthijs de Ligt (Juventus) Kylian Mbappe (PSG) Last year\u2019s winners are on stage, and that\u2019s Ada Hegerberg, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Luka Modric. The Croatian says: \u201cIt was something amazing and it will stay for the rest of my life.\u201d That\u2019s Luka done for the night. He didn\u2019t even make the top 30 this year. Didier Drogba has gone off-piste, and is talking about that Barcelona win at Chelsea in 2009. Turns out that Mbapp\u00e9 was a young man waiting for his autograph that night and DD stormed home in a huff. Now he is making up for it by having a selfie taken. Here\u2019s the nominees for the Yachin award for goalkeepers. Alisson (Liverpool and Brazil) Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) Ederson (Manchester City and Brazil) Andre Onana (Ajax and Cameroon) Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus and Poland) Jan Oblak (Atletico Madrid and Slovenia) Kepa (Chelsea and Spain) Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia) Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France) Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany) There have been props to former winners like Pavel Nedved, Hristo Stoichkov and last year\u2019s winner, Luka Modric, before the top ten for the male category are announced. Ok, here we are in the Theatre, and it\u2019s Didier Drogba who is the master of ceremonies alongside Sandy Heribert, a Eurosport presenter and who also heads up something called the Ultimate Beastmaster. Oxford, Cambridge, Hull; Milligan, Cleese, Sessions. That\u2019s what these three-men Ballon D\u2019Or podiums have often resembled in recent years, with the greatest of respect for the likes of Neymar, Antoine Griezmann and Franck Ribery having to applaud one of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as they go to collect their latest gong. Less so this time, with Virgil van Dijk having such a stellar 2019. However, the last defenders to win this award was Matthias Sammer way back in 1996, in the dwindling days of the sweeper and Fabio Cannavaro in 2006. Lionel Messi is overriding favourite, with Cristiano Ronaldo not quite at the level of 2017, the last time he won the award. The great men are locked at five each after Luka Modric stole away with it last year and there is even the possibility that Big Ron won\u2019t even make the podium. There is Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah to consider, too. For the women\u2019s award, Megan Rapoinoe is favourite, with England\u2019s Lucy Bronze in the mix. Last year\u2019s winner, Ada Hegerberg, may lose out after choosing not to go to last summer\u2019s World Cup. The venue is Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, as this award is France Football\u2019s babychild."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
