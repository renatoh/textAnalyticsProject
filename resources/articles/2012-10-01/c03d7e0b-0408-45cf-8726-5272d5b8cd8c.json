The original quartet have all returned and Craig Charles claims the show is \"back to what it does best\". See for yourself if that claim stands up by viewing the most recent episode at Dave on-demand. uktv.co.uk/dave TV: Be Your Own Boss A blending together of The Apprentice and Dragons' Den, this series sees prodigious entrepreneurial types pitch their ideas to Richard Reed, multi-millionaire and co-founder of Innocent, in the hope of earning a hefty investment. It doesn't exactly bring any new ideas to the table, but smoothie man Reed at least provides a fresher-faced, more open-shirted alternative to Lord Sugar's grouch. The series is available to view in full on iPlayer until Wednesday evening. BBC iPlayer Podcast: Nerdist The pop-culture podcast snared a high-profile special guest last week in the form of Tom Hanks who, it emerges, is a massive nerd. Listen to Hanks discussing Nasa, vintage typewriters and dressing up as a woman for the short-lived 80s sitcom Bosom Buddies over on the Nerdist website. nerdist.com TV: The Colbert Report The parodic prince of punditry received props on both sides of the Atlantic for his recent interview with/takedown of Morrissey. Yet The Colbert Report is still nowhere to be seen on our screens, meaning that the only way of catching it is by downloading episodes at \u00a31.89 a pop on iTunes or \u00a39.99 for a 15 episode multi-pass. A bit steep, sure, but how else do you expect to get your daily dose of \"truthiness\"? iTunes TV: Ruby Wax: What's So Funny About Mental Illness? \"How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy, except the brain?\" Ruby Wax follows her Channel 4 special on mental illness with a thought-provoking TED talk. Hardly your typical TED speaker, Wax nevertheless constructs a persuasive plea to end the stigma surrounding mental illness, drawing on her own experiences with depression. Illuminating. ted.com/talks TV: The Plane Crash Channel 4's latest high-concept idea proved a ratings winner: 3.2 million viewers tuned in to watch an intrepid crew of pilots smash a big metal bird into a Mexican desert in the name of science. If that sounds like your kind of thing, the whole bonkers stunt is available to gawp at in full over on 4oD. Buckle up. 4oD"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
