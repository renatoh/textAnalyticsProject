History, recent and distant, is hardly in Strachan\u2019s favour: Scotland have beaten England six times in 50 years and taken seven points from five matches in the latest quest to end a miserable absence from major championships. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a free hit, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that,\u201d said Strachan. \u201cI genuinely believe we can win the game, I really do. I\u2019d be really disappointed if we didn\u2019t get anything from the game.\u201d Pressed on what possible evidence Strachan had for this bullish approach, he referenced the 3-0 loss at Wembley in November. Scotland\u2019s showing there has routinely been worthy of more praise than is valid \u2013mainly from the manager. \u201cI take stuff from the last England game, where we would all agree that there was nothing happening and we were comfortable and doing a lot of things we had worked on,\u201d Strachan explained. \u201cWe get a couple of chances, we don\u2019t take them, we could have been in the lead. If big Grant Hanley was playing regularly, he would have put that header in the back of the net and then Gary Cahill loops one in. \u201cThat\u2019s how close we were, so I take that. Then I take the training, the enthusiasm of the training, and what the guys who have had a good season are bringing to the group, all that adds up to feeling good.\u201d If Scotland are to lose \u2013 and the manner of defeat may be more significant than whether it happens \u2013 further pressure will surround Strachan\u2019s position. There is a genuine possibility this could be his last match in charge despite, contrary to reports this week, the Scottish Football Association having no shortlist of alternative candidates. Strachan desperately needs a marquee result such as victory over the Auld Enemy to back up regular claims of progress. Strachan, as is typical, swatted aside any discussion of this game being crucial to his own situation. \u201cI\u2019m OK. I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cFunnily enough I want to win for everyone bar myself. So we\u2019re looking after one another.\u201d England\u2019s record, of an unbeaten qualifying run that stretches to 34 games, is not lost on the Scotland manager but does not seem to be a source of fear. \u201cI know for a fact that playing for England brings it own stresses and pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they have to deal with and so far they have dealt with it well. I\u2019m sure they would have liked to do better at tournaments but qualifying has been terrific. We said getting second would be fine and it\u2019s still the target.\u201d Strachan is believed to have considered a three-man defence as the most legitimate means of handling England but may feel he lacks the resources to deploy that formation. His two most serious calls would appear to be in the wide right attacking position \u2013 where James Forrest and Ryan Fraser are candidates to play \u2013and at centre-forward, with Leigh Griffiths and Chris Martin the options. Martin\u2019s late goal against Slovenia in March kept alive faint hopes of Scotland featuring in next summer\u2019s World Cup. Craig Gordon, who will start in goal for the hosts, will not lack motivation for a potential meeting with Jermain Defoe. When at Sunderland in 2009, Gordon was involved in a clash with Defoe, then of Tottenham Hotspur, which resulted in the goalkeeper sustaining a broken arm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pleased with the challenge,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cIt was a long time ago and these things happen in football. There is no way it will have any bearing on this match. I went out to dive at his feet. It was a challenge where he kicked my arm and broke it. He tried to make contact after the game but I wasn\u2019t interested in speaking to him. He did try, to be fair to him. \u201cIt had a lot of impact on the progress I was making in my career at that time. When something as bad as that happens to you in your career \u2013 and because of the problems I had after, re-breaking it, I\u2019ve still got the metal work in there from the three operations I needed to fix it \u2013 then it\u2019s obviously going to stick with you a bit. Let\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t score.\u201d One quirk of previous encounters may be on Strachan\u2019s side: the presence of his opposite number, Gareth Southgate, in the England team for the visit of Scotland in 1999 was sufficient for Don Hutchison to be belatedly drafted into the visiting lineup at Wembley. Hutchison scored to secure Scotland a 1-0 win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
