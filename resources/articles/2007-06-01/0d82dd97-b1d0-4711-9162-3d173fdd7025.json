If it were, or should I say if it ever will be or ever was, then where are all the time travellers? Where are the hordes of future folk nipping back to now and then for a glimpse of our collective lunacy? Fast forward to this time next week. It's the first official day for the new chief executive of the Scottish Football Association and the most remarkable case of poacher turned gamekeeper (or is it goalkeeper?) since, well, since the former editor of the News of the World became David Cameron's chief spin doctor. Not long then - but it is an astonishing turn of events. Gordon Smith, the former striker, coach, assistant manager, TV pundit and, latterly, football agent (cue Victorian melodrama music), will be donning the ceremonial blue blazer worn previously by some of the most spectacularly mediocre figures in Scottish football's long and colourful history. \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you care to look out of your windows you will see that we have arrived in the 21st century.\" I rang Gordon to congratulate him and, given that he's got a fuller plate than a Floridian at a buffet, I wanted to get a sense of how he was going to tackle the big issues facing the game. The national team? Grass-roots participation? And, yes, sectarianism? I didn't, though. But he was the one who brought up metaphysics, I promise. He said it with a chuckle: \"If they ever invent a time machine, count me in.\" Back to May 1983, then. \"Smith must score,\" declaimed the great Peter Jones in his radio commentary. I asked Gordon about his notorious last-minute miss for Brighton in the FA Cup final against Manchester United because I've always wondered if Chris Waddle, Stuart Pearce and others, despite the inner steel that got them to the top in the first place, ever stop hurting deep inside. I've spoken to Waddle about his penalty miss and he is a fantastically phlegmatic character who went on to have an outstanding season with Marseille in 1991. He once said: \"There were two ways to react: basically you can do a Lord Lucan and disappear or stick your chest out and prove to everybody you're a good footballer. That's the one I opted for. I certainly don't dwell on the memory.\" There is a hint, though, in the last bit. I wonder if, in the darkest night, the memory still comes knocking. Smith is candid. \"There were difficult times in the early days when it had a real effect on me.\" Not long after the Cup final he found himself in a woebegone reserve match and some nonentity started taunting him. Smith calmly looked in the guy's eyes and said: \"What does the Cup final look like on TV, because it's great to play in.\" After he retired he got a job in financial services in London and recalls the boss's phone calls. \"We've got an ex-footballer, Gordon Smith, working for us now.\" And then the sotto voce: \"Yes, that's the one.\" Smith's memory of the final is priceless, by turns the stuff of boyhood dreams and adult nightmares. He had put Brighton 1-0 up, remember. Imagine coming off that pristine green carpet at half-time and seeing your name on the scoreboard. \"I thought, 'I'll be remembered for this game.'\" How right he was. So what happened? \"It had got to extra-time and we were in the last minute. I thought low and hard would take him by surprise but he blocked it and smothered the rebound. What would I do differently? Definitely wait and see if he committed himself.\" \"He\" of course is Gary Bailey, a man still miffed that Jones didn't say: \"What a save by Bailey!\" \"I turned away and thought, shit, I could have scored there,\" remembers Smith. \"It would have been the winning goal in the Cup final. It would have won the Cup for Brighton. I should have done better.\" Brighton lost the replay 4-0 but the next season Smith was Manchester City's top scorer in their promotion drive. As Waddle said, it's all down to how you respond. Smith pointed something else out as I listened earnestly. \"The next season I signed a record-breaking 10-grand deal with Adidas.\" \"Did you?\" \"Yeah. To wear Nike.\" Now he is running the SFA and it is great news for the Scottish game. He is an impressive man and I'd hazard that's in no small part thanks to a blond-haired South African goalkeeper. Gordon, give that Tardis a wide berth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
