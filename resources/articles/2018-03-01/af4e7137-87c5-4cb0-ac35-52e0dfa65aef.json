With tears rolling down her cheeks, intermittently closing her eyes, the teenager\u2019s stillness told its own story. In the moments before, she had called out the name of each of her fellow students and teachers gunned down five weeks ago. By the time she broke her silence Gonzalez had been on stage for six minutes and 20 seconds, the same time it took a gunman to claim 17 lives at her school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, in Parkland, Florida. \u201cNo one could comprehend the devastating aftermath or how far this would reach or where this would go,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who still can\u2019t comprehend because they refuse to, I\u2019ll tell you where it went: right into the ground, six feet deep.\u201d That a teenager unknown to the country until a little over a month ago could command such quiet respect and deep introspection at a rally of this size illustrates just how powerful the student-led movement to rise from the Parkland massacre has become. Marchers from all over the United States had filled Pennsylvania Avenue from front to back, spilling over into walkways and holding signs aloft that decried endemic American gun violence, hapless politicians and the extremist gun rights movement that holds them captive. One-by-one students from Parkland took to the stage to offer a series of combative, direct and emotionally raw speeches to the throngs on the street in front of them. \u201cWhen politicians send thoughts and prayers we say no more!\u201d said 17-year-old David Hogg. \u201cI say to politicians: get your r\u00e9sum\u00e9s ready!\u201d \u201cWelcome to the revolution,\u201d said Cameron Kasky, also 17. \u201cEither represent the people or get out.\u201d \u201cWe are done hiding,\u201d said 18-year-old Ryan Deitsch. \u201cWe are done being full of fear. This is the beginning of the end. From here, we fight.\u201d The crowd responded with intermittent chants of \u201cVote them out!\u201d and at one point sang happy birthday to Nicholas Dworet, one of the students murdered on 14 February who would have turned 18 on Saturday. Thousands more rallied in cities and municipalities around the United States, including New York, Phoenix, Atlanta, Oakland and Parkland itself, with more than 800 March for Our Lives events planned at locations spanning the world. But organizers in Washington were keen to make this centrepiece rally an inclusive event, with many of the most impassioned speeches made by young gun violence victims from other areas of the US. Seventeen-year-old Edna Chavez, from Manual Arts High in South Los Angeles, walked on to stage with her right hand clenched in a first held above her head. With poise and indignation, she told the story of how her older brother was shot dead when she was a young child. \u201cI have lived in South Los Angeles my entire life and have lost many loved ones to gun violence. This is normal. It\u2019s normal to the point that I learned to duck from bullets before I learned how to read,\u201d she said, asking the crowd to chant her brother\u2019s name: Ricardo. \u201cIt was a day like any other day. The sunset was going down on South Central. You hear pops thinking they were fireworks. They weren\u2019t pops. You see the melanin on your brother\u2019s skin turn grey.\u201d Naomi Wadler, from Alexandria, Virginia, spoke with a fluency and eloquence that seemed beyond her 11 years of age. She told the marchers she was present to \u201cacknowledge the African American girls whose stories don\u2019t make the front page of every national newspaper, whose stories don\u2019t lead on the evening news. The African American women who are simply statistics instead of vibrant, beautiful girls full of potential.\u201d Teenagers from Chicago and New York as well as victims of the school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook elementary also addressed the rally. \u201cI\u2019m here to speak for those Chicago youth who feel their voices have been silenced for far too long,\u201d said Trevon Bosley, 19. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to speak on behalf of everyone who believes a child getting shot and killed in Chicago or any other city is still a not-acceptable norm.\u201d It was not just Emma Gonzalez who observed silence on the day that hundreds of thousands descended on Washington. Donald Trump, spending the weekend at his members\u2019 club in South Florida, offered no comment or tweet on the marchers. Instead, the White House issued a short statement before the rally began applauding the \u201ccourageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights\u201d, the right to free speech. Trump, who had once seemed amenable to some of the demands for gun control echoing from the Parkland tragedy, has since reneged under pressure from the NRA. The president has instead pushed arming teachers with firearms to fend off attackers. That proposal was repeatedly booed by those assembled in Washington. \u201cArming teachers will not work,\u201d said Chavez. \u201cMore security in our schools does not work. Zero tolerance police do not work. They make us feel like criminals. We should feel supported and empowered in our schools.\u201d As the rally closed, marchers melted on to the streets of downtown DC, still chanting what had become one of the major themes of the rally, one that seems likely to rattle nerves a short distance away on Capitol Hill: \u201cVote them out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
