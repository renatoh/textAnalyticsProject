Admittedly, he ran atrociously last time at Perth, but that came only two days after a far better performance when fourth at the same course. Otage de Brion should be able to add to his Plumpton win in the 3.0. He had some smart form in France before that easy win on his first run for Charlie Longsdon and he has the services of Tony McCoy in his bid to defy a 7lb penalty. Henderson has strong claims with Tinagoodnight, another French import, in the juvenile hurdle at Kempton (2.20), while her stablemate French Opera will improve for a recent outing over hurdles when he runs in the 3.25. Latimer's Place went well first time last year and should be suited by the right-handed course in the 5.05. Hoh Wotanite wins a narrow vote in a tight-knit handicap at Wolverhampton (4.25). William Buick's 3lb claim should come in handy at a course-and-distance Hoh Wotanite enjoys. Azygous looks worth chancing in the 4.55 despite a wide draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
