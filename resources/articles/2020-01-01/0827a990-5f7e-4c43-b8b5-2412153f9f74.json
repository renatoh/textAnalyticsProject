Joyous scenes engulfed Villa Park after a thrilling semi-final in which Matt Targett opened the scoring for the hosts before Kelechi Iheanacho equalised. Leicester had several chances to win before Villa got what Smith hailed as \u201ca goal made in Egypt\u201d, with Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet firing into the net from a cross by Ahmed Elmohamady. \u201cI certainly let myself go when we scored that goal,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt means an awful lot. We\u2019ve got a proud history in this competition and if we could go and lift the trophy for the sixth time for this club, then I\u2019ll be a very proud man.\u201d Villa\u2019s opponents will be determined by the outcome of Wednesday\u2019s other semi-final, with Manchester City taking a 3-1 lead into the second leg at the Etihad. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be tough against Manchester City or Manchester United but the hard part is getting to a cup final and we\u2019ve managed to do that against a very good Leicester team.\u201d Their victory was partly down to an outstanding performance by Orjan Nyland, who was restored in goal in place of the January recruit Pepe Reina, who watched from the stands owing to a minor calf injury. Nyland had also performed heroics in the first leg, and Smith admitted he now has a difficult selection decision to make for the final. \u201c[Nyland] has certainly given me a conundrum but they\u2019re the ones I want.\u201d Smith said he hoped this result will help Villa climb away from relegation trouble in the Premier League, where they are two points off the bottom three. \u201cThat win may give everybody belief in what we\u2019re doing \u2026 it shows there\u2019s an awful lot of character and quality in this squad.\u201d The Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, said he was \u201cgutted for the players\u201d after his team\u2019s defeat but said they must ensure it makes them stronger. \u201cI said to the players \u2018this is what you need as a player. This will increase your determination. You\u2019ve been brilliant, over the two games the only criticism is we could have been more clinical. But we can use it as a great motivator going forward. It\u2019s a process and this is part of it. It hurts but that hurt will help you going forward.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
