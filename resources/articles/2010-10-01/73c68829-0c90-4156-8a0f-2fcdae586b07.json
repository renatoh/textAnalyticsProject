Proficient tap dancer and flute player\" My last long-term relationship ended 12 years ago, when I was 23. We had been together for two years. I was moving to London from Manchester and he was French and wanted to move back to France. I wasn't ready to settle down at the time. We stayed friends for a long time, but he's now in another relationship and his girlfriend doesn't want us staying in touch so we don't speak any more. It's upsetting, because he was a really good friend, but I can understand how his girlfriend might feel threatened. I've dated people for months at a time since then, but there hasn't been anyone long term. I've been online dating for a few years on and off, but I haven't met the one I want to be with. There have been some real characters. Probably the worst date was late last year with a guy who was four years younger than me. Within 10 minutes of meeting he started telling me that a woman my age was too old to be single, that 23 to 24 was the ideal age for marriage and that by the time I had kids I'd be too old. He then started going on about how he was still in love with his ex. Needless to say, that was the end of that. There was another charmer who asked to meet on the outskirts of Old Street in London, just outside the congestion-charge zone because he didn't want to pay it. We went to Upper Street and were trying to decide where to go when he pointed out a pub that had a sign saying \"Two meals for \u00a38.95\". I don't want to be with someone who's so openly tight \u2013 it's really unattractive. There was a guy I quite liked, but he turned out to be a compulsive liar. He said he didn't have children and a year later I found out he had a daughter. Why would you lie about having a child? Honesty is really, really important to me. I'd like to settle down and have a family. I'm 35 now so I don't really have time to hang about. I'm not just wanting to meet someone so I can have a baby. I don't have a \"type\", I go for any nationality, but I like tall men. I'm looking for someone funny and open\u2011minded, and someone who can cook is always a bonus! I'm honest and I think I'm funny. I play the flute and piccolo, I love tap dancing and trying new things. I'm very faithful, too, and that's important to me, so no straying! I'm really busy setting up my handmade cosmetics business at the moment, so I'm not sitting around waiting for Mr Right, but I'd like to have faith that I'll meet him one day.
