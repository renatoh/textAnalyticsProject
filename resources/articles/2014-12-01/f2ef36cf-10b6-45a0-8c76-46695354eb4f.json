At the start of the unusually packed press conference, the US president joked that he would consult a \u201cnaughty and nice list\u201d drawn up by his press secretary to determine who to call on. Based on Obama\u2019s list, it was a particularly good year for female political journalists. All eight questions the president answered were from female journalists. And not just any women, but specifically print and radio journalists. The journalists asked Obama about the Sony hack, his decision to normalize relations with Cuba, and American race relations. Twitter, of course, immediately picked up on the president\u2019s preferential treatment. While the women in the room cheered the president\u2019s picks, some network journalists were overheard grumbling at not being the chosen ones this year as they exited the conference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
