Arifa has written about the arts for the Guardian for several years and has contributed to the Observer. Arifa was the literary editor of the Independent, where she also worked as a news reporter and arts correspondent. She was head of content for the publisher Unbound, where she launched and edited the long-form literary website, Boundless, in 2017. She will be leaving her role as arts editor at Tortoise Media to take up the position at the Guardian. Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, the Guardian, said: \u201cArifa is a wonderful writer on the arts, and as a theatre lover I\u2019m delighted she has agreed to become the Guardian\u2019s new chief theatre critic. Her reviews are thoughtful, evocative and insightful; they\u2019re sometimes witty and often moving. I can\u2019t think of a better writer to guide Guardian readers through all that is new and exciting on the stage.\u201d On her appointment, Arifa said: \u201cI have always loved the Guardian and it has only grown more dynamic, diverse and campaigning under Katharine Viner, not just in its political coverage but across the arts too.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s theatre is alive with imagination, passion and fury, talking directly to, and about, the world we live in. I hope to reflect that in my coverage and critiques.\u201d Arifa will succeed the Guardian\u2019s current chief theatre critic Michael Billington who announced this week that he will be stepping down at Christmas after five decades and 10,000 reviews in the role. Arifa is a trustee of the Orwell Foundation and helps to run its annual book prize. She has judged various prizes including the Costa Biography Award, the UK Theatre Awards and the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction. -ends- For more information please contact: media.enquiries@theguardian.com or 020 3353 3696 Notes to editors About Guardian News &amp; Media Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world\u2019s leading English-language newspaper websites.
