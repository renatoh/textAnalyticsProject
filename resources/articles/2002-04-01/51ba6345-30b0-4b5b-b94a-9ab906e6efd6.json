The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra's all-American programme provided ample opportunity for Christie to show what he can do, balancing Copland and Bernstein with Roy Harris and performer-composer Edgar Meyer. Copland's nostalgic evocation of a bygone age of rural community in his ballet Appalachian Spring has lost none of its gentle appeal since its premiere in 1944; in fact, the older it becomes, the more interesting it sounds. Instead of recreating the sounds of barn dances and hoedowns, Copland stylised them so that they could be used as ingredients in an \"authentic\" American classical style. Christie's relaxed, warm approach was ideal for Copland's expansive, mellow sound. It was the newest work - Meyer's Double Bass Concerto - that most demonstrated how potent the folk inheritance has been for American composers. Drawing on a range of popular music, including jazz and blues, the solo part is stunningly well written, full of the kind of improvisatory subtitles that Meyer is ideally placed to explore. The orchestral writing is less assured, though there was some beautifully crafted dialogue between bass and oboe in the slow movement. There was more than a touch of Copland's barn dance style in the finale, though in a far more authentic style, with bluegrass solos and rustic string drones. The real test piece for Christie was Harris's Third Symphony, which, at least on this occasion, was not a work the RLPO took to their hearts. It is rare for a major British symphony orchestra to play as badly as this, though it was by no means clear whether it was Christie or the orchestra who were to blame. However, it was abundantly clear why Bernstein's Symphonic Dances from West Side Story suffered a similar fate. Christie's tempi were insanely fast - faster than it would be humanly possible to sing - and he seemed astonishingly oblivious to colour and balance. Both Bernstein and the RLPO deserved better."}, "isHosted": false}}}
