An ICC knockout tournament, a three-month Ashes series and an overblown World Cup in South Africa will combine to give England their most taxing winter ever and will bring fears that more players will shun part of the winter, pleading family commitments. This winter Darren Gough and Alec Stewart both refused to tour India on the grounds that they needed a rest, Andrew Caddick and Robert Croft later withdrew because of safety fears and Michael Atherton entered what many regarded as premature retirement. Graham Thorpe also abandoned the India tour 10 days ago, on the eve of the second Test, because of marital difficulties. Confirmation of the Ashes schedule came from the Australian Cricket Board yesterday and shows that the team will begin their tour with the traditional match against the Chairman's Xl in Lilac Hill, Perth on October 22 and will finish in Adelaide on January 27 should they progress to the finals of the one-day series and it goes to a third match. Many players are privately incensed that the England and Wales Cricket Board has surrendered meekly to Australia's insistence that the one-day series should be played on either side of the Christmas and New Year Tests in Sydney and Melbourne, which are viewed as sacrosanct. That will bring all kinds of logistical problems for England, who increasingly are developing distinct Test and one-day squads. Rather than spending the maximum amount of time at home, players included in only one squad will now have to shuttle backwards and forwards across the world or, more likely, be left kicking their heels in Australia for weeks. The ICC Knockout, a fund-raiser for developing cricket nations which involves all Test countries, will take place from the end of September to mid-October. The tournament was scheduled for Bangalore but the Indian government's refusal to grant tax exemption has led to a stand-off with the ICC and the possibility that it will be switched to Sharjah. To hold it, in any event, less than six months before a World Cup, will bring charges of overkill. The Ashes series is interrupted after three Tests for early pre-Christmas matches in the one-day series, also involving Sri Lanka. England career between Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth in eight insane days. Following the tour of Australia England's one-day side will go straight to South Africa for the most extensive World Cup ever played. For England's captain Nasser Hussain and a number of others it could mean virtually six exhausting months on the road. Hussain has spent several hours with England's coach Duncan Fletcher poring over an Australian itinerary that has been designed by the marketing men, with maximum profit, not maximum wellbeing, in mind. \"We are trying to look at the Australian itinerary with the ECB and get things right,\" said Hussain. \"Just one subtle thing wrong in the itinerary - the wrong hotel or a day in the wrong place - and you might suffer for it for the rest of the tour.\" For Hussain to put his faith in the power of subtle changes is optimistic in the extreme. The second and third Ashes Tests, in Perth and Adelaide, are only four days apart and the Christmas/New Year Tests are divided by only two rest days. England are at least becoming used to it. They begin their third successive back-to-back Test in Bangalore today, needing a win to tie the series one-all. David Graveney, the chairman of selectors, tried to present next winter's programme in optimistic light. \"Matches tend to be back to back these days; that's the modern diet,\" he said. \"Most countries try and get three clear days between matches as is happening in India. It's a unique situation for next year because of the World Cup but we're very happy to be getting the right sort of rest period for our players.\" Presumably they will be allowed to go to sleep on the field.
