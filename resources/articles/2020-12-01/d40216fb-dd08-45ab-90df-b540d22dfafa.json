Although Arteta\u2019s job is not believed to be in danger at this time, Arsenal find themselves in a spiral that is becoming harder to escape with each damaging result. Indiscipline is a particular problem and they were undone against Burnley when Granit Xhaka was dismissed shortly before the hour for grabbing Ashley Westwood\u2019s throat. A Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang own goal then gave Burnley the points and Arteta was left to rue Xhaka\u2019s indiscretion. \u201cSame word\u201d he said when asked whether he would describe his midfielder\u2019s actions as \u201cunacceptable\u201d, which was the term he used after Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 was sent off for his own act of violent conduct at Leeds last month. \u201cAnd in these conditions even worse. [In] the conditions that we are in when we are not winning football matches it\u2019s even worse.\u201d Arteta appeared willing to let Xhaka off lightly in public, suggesting he had been too fired up to put Arsenal\u2019s season back on track. \u201cHonestly, I think it is unacceptable to do that action and the players are in a moment where they are so willing to do more, to fight more, to show how committed they are, to be alive in the games,\u201d he said. \u201cOn this occasion Granit has overstepped the line.\u201d Presumably Arteta will have been fuming in private and he indicated that he expects Xhaka to front up to his mistake in the dressing room, admitting the red card had \u201ccost us\u201d and that his side were \u201churting\u201d. He also addressed an incident involving Mohamed Elneny, just before the winning goal, in which the Egyptian was fortunate not to follow Xhaka down the tunnel after shoving James Tarkowski. \u201cIt looks similar and we cannot make that mistake because that\u2019s the wrong approach to what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said. Arsenal have scored twice in those eight winless matches \u2013 an Aubameyang penalty at Old Trafford and a Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es header after a corner against Wolves \u2013 but Arteta does not believe his side are playing like potential relegation candidates. \u201cA team that is struggling, we don\u2019t normally see play the way they did today, and with the way they played against Spurs [a week ago],\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave the opponent a chance and they scored, and it\u2019s about winning football matches.\u201d Arteta\u2019s opposite number, Sean Dyche, believed Arsenal should have been reduced to nine men but hailed his own side\u2019s first away win of the campaign. \u201cXhaka\u2019s getting sent off, I don\u2019t know how Elneny doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe performance was built on what we\u2019ve done so many times: that strength of unity to work for each other and then find the right margins.\u201d Arsenal face a quickfire return to the Emirates on Wednesday when they take on a buoyant Southampton. Arteta will welcome back P\u00e9p\u00e9 from suspension but Xhaka will miss the first of his three games out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
