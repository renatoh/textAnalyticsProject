Ultimately it seems that Eriksson chose Anfield on Wednesday night, instead of Old Trafford, to check on Liverpool's Jamie Carragher and Danny Murphy rather than Blackburn Rovers' Matt Jansen. None of the three made it into the squad, though at least Murphy has the consolation/anxiety of being on standby. It's Murphy's Law. Carragher, Eriksson revealed, has a knee injury, thereby providing a rational explanation for possibly the most unexpected omission. The Liverpudlian had come on for Gary Neville in England's most recent game, the friendly with Paraguay at Anfield 3 weeks ago, and when Neville suffered his metatarsal injury soon afterwards it would have been only natural for Carragher to think that one man's injury is another's opportunity. But the Liverpool midfielder has sustained an injury of his own and will fly to America for treatment on Monday while Danny Mills and Wes Brown head for Dubai on the first leg of England's World Cup journey. Otherwise it might have been Carragher and Neville G as the right-back personnel. Eriksson said that he had taken the time to telephone those he thought would be genuinely disappointed by their omission yesterday - so Ray Parlour, Graeme le Saux and Darren Anderton will not have expected a call - which presumably meant that the coach did dial Phil Neville's mobile number. This will have been the hardest call to make. Four years ago Neville was told by Glenn Hoddle that he was unwanted in France and he had to be escorted off the premises in tears by his elder brother. His star has since waned but he has been in every squad Eriksson has named, when fit. Until yesterday. \"I feel sorry for a lot of players,\" Eriksson said. \"They have been working hard and had good seasons and helped us qualify, but I've had to phone them and leave messages. You don't want to do that in life.\" Eriksson refused to divulge those to whom he had chosen to break the news personally, but one he did mention by name was Steve McManaman. He did not say how the news had been received but it showed that their relationship was closer than some people had thought. McManaman refused to speak at Real Madrid's training ground yesterday but his colleagues expressed their consternation. \"I'm very surprised,\" said Roberto Carlos. \"I wasn't expecting this. He's a top-quality guy as well as a top-quality player.\" Zinedine Zidane agreed: \"I'm very disappointed for him.\" McManaman, Le Saux and Anderton are veterans of France '98 but players such as Ugo Ehiogu, Frank Lampard and Trevor Sinclair have had no such experience and, judging by Sinclair's reaction, were realistic about making the squad. \"I found out after training this morning,\" Sinclair said. \"We were looking at Teletext in the manager's office and it wasn't a massive surprise, to be honest. I had a few caps and I gave it everything on and off the pitch but it just wasn't quite good enough. \"I have not quite made the impact I could have, although it is difficult to make that grade - everyone there is a good athlete and all quick in the mind. To make a telling contribution at international level is more difficult than it is in the Premiership. I have not quite had a massive effect on a game for England. I have not cracked it 100% at that level.\" His former club-mate Frank Lampard could have said the same and he and Sinclair must have felt a breeze of disappointment as Joe Cole and Owen Hargreaves swept past them against Paraguay. Jansen, who would have won his first cap then but for an upset stomach, should be soothed by the fact that he came so close. There was no consolation for Jansen's striking partner at Blackburn, Andy Cole; he reacted to his exclusion by announcing his international retirement. As for Nicky Barmby - whatever happened to him? The man who started on the left in the 5-1 win in Munich last September ended up being just AN Other of those left behind. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
