Team's Ladyflash sets me up for the day, puts a glint in my eye and raises goosebumps on the train journey to work; the Nancy and Lee sample lures me in from the first second of the track. Similarly, Joe Gibbs's African Dub Chapter Three crackles with the joy of making music, its playful soundscape encompassing everything from doorbells ringing to toilets being flushed. As I leave the train and make my way through the crowds, I listen to the lush, dreamy and ethereal sound of Roygbiv, by Boards Of Canada, before turning to Arvo P\u00e4rt's stately tribute to one of Britain's finest composers. My final track of the morning is Serge Gainsbourg's (pictured below) miraculous slab of orchestral funk from the Anna soundtrack, a piece of music that was made in 1967 but sounds like the handiwork of Portishead, DJ Shadow or MF Doom.
