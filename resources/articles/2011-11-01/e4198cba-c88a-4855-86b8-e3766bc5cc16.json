Not so long ago, the statistic would have been seized upon as yet more proof of Fabio Capello's acumen. The manager will hardly be exhilarated after a club career festooned with honours, but there was a reminder that his merits are not to be overlooked just because minds are turning to the identity of his successor. After the debacle of the 2010 World Cup, deductions are made from any praise of Capello. A manager would prefer trust and intermittent adulation, but this one will have to settle for less. The assumption is almost unshakeable that some countries, such as Spain and Germany, are too good to be overcome by England in next year's European Championship. This sense of proportion is welcome, even if it emerged from a slight scepticism about the national team and Capello himself. The defeat of Sweden did not inspire awe, but England attacked rather a lot and demonstrated to the Wembley audience that there are careers that may blossom in due course. It is all but mandatory to applaud the Manchester United teenager Phil Jones. He is currently a midfielder for his country, but in the long term his mobility may make him a centre-half who effortlessly makes the sort of challenges that have forwards despairing of ever being free of him. Capello is almost lavish with compliments, as if he had been hoarding them during his more severe years in management. \"I found in my career probably two players [like him],\" the manager said of Jones. \"He can play in different positions, always at the top level. He is so young. He is a big talent because when he receives the ball he plays always without fear. Good passes. I know something about football and the solution that he chooses [is] always the best.\" Capello said that, in Jones, he has an alternative should the influential Scott Parker be unavailable. There were moments when the manager ditched his normal sense of proportion. The two players he saw as counterparts to Jones were Fernando Hierro and Franco Baresi. \"They played as midfielders and after they played centre-back,\" he said. Capello still knows that Jones has far to go before he is renowned. The manager highlights someone like him to eradicate complacency. A friendly at home can be congenial and there are rigours ahead, but it is a small sign of change that you seldom hear anxious discussion of, say, Steven Gerrard's reinstatement in the national team when he is fully fit. It would be delusional to think that Capello has deleted the numbers of senior footballers from his mobile, but some will have to sweat as they await his call. That type of insecurity should hone the competition for places with England, but there were small misgivings for the manager on Tuesday. Even allowing for the unfamiliarity of some players with one another, England left themselves disturbingly open to attacks by Sweden and, on another evening, goals would have been conceded by a back four that did not get enough help from the midfield, no matter how much appreciation there was for Jones. The clean sheet would have been particularly heartening for Capello since it was the work of a partnership. Following the hard-fought 1-0 over Spain, there was perhaps a desire in the squad to relax. Experiments did not lead to major discoveries on Tuesday. It just seemed good sense that Capello should confirm the occasional merit of having available someone with the build of a target man, such as Bobby Zamora. By the same token, it was useful for the manager to let Scott Carson take over from Hart for the second half. The dangers of total dependence on the first-choice goalkeeper are glaring. Carson has had to persevere and the cap he collected against Sweden was his fourth, despite him making his debut as long ago as 2007. The manager softened enough to say he was happy for the goalkeeper. Carson's readiness to turn up when he might not have been called upon is particularly commendable since he made the fairly long journey from Turkey, where he plays for Bursaspor. That commitment would have registered with Capello. The entire fixture was a matter of small yet important checks, rather than sweeping revelations. There was further evidence that John Terry and Gary Cahill are a good blend in central defence. By the same token, Capello could watch Kyle Walker, even if it may be a little soon for the right-back to be in the party for Euro 2012. The manager is becoming enamoured of his role as mentor. \"I think when we play the Euros it will be better than now,\" he said. \"They can improve because they are young.\" Capello looks forward, in particular, to the return of Jack Wilshere. The Arsenal midfielder may be over his ankle trouble early in 2012. Jack Rodwell, another young candidate for that department of the team, was placed in the same category as Jones after making his mark against Sweden. \"Young players put something on the pitch, something new,\" said the manager, \"something more. It's important.\" On occasion, Capello comes close to fantasising that he will be spoiled for choice by the time of the European Championship. In reality, injury and misfortune will assist him in cutting back the options. He still has to reckon with the prospect of Wayne Rooney being suspended for the group phase of the finals. Neither Capello nor the player himself is expected to attend the appeal in Nyon against the three-match ban on 9 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
