The England midfielder, who missed nearly six months of last season after injuring his ankle in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 22 November, was omitted from the side who beat Chelsea 1-0 at Wembley in Sunday\u2019s Community Shield, and afterwards Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said the player would only be out for \u201cdays\u201d. However, it now appears Wilshere\u2019s injury is much worse than originally feared, with Arsenal prepared for bad news when the full extent of the damage to his left fibula is revealed by scans on Friday. Unconfirmed reports suggested he was injured by a tackle from the Brazilian defender Gabriel. If he requires surgery, the 23-year-old could be out for up to three months but could be back with six to eight weeks if not. Wilshere\u2019s availability for England\u2019s next two Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Switzerland at the start of September now appears very unlikely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
