Answer: no idea \u2013 first we need to find one willing to stand up and be counted. There has been a fair bit of talk since the election that the ALP has to rediscover the centre and stop trying to appeal to progressives. Mostly it involves imitating the Australian\u2019s Paul Kelly about needing to connect with quiet Australians and let go of fashionable causes. It all sounds very sensible \u2013 or would, if there was any real evidence that the ALP was actually progressive in any meaningful sense. The ALP mostly indulges in progressive cosplay. It dabbles but the commitment is not there \u2013 it will get pushed over by the barest mention of national security or talk of traditional values, and voters know it. In reality, most in the party are glued to the centre. This week the former US president Barack Obama suggested to college students that \u201cthis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re politically woke, and all that stuff \u2013 you should get over that quickly\u201d. His words were unsurprisingly greeted with joy by those for whom centrism is the great security blanket and by conservatives who could rejoice that Obama was calling out the \u201ccancel culture\u201d of the left. His words echoed those of Labor MP Clare O\u2019Neil, who in a speech this week to the John Curtin Research Centre, said \u201cthere is a culture developing in the progressive movement where membership is granted with a box of ideas. And if you don\u2019t accept one of the ideas in the box, you do not merely have a different opinion, you are obviously wrong, probably stupid and possibly subhuman\u201d. But the problem with criticism of the \u201ccancel culture\u201d is it ignores that the ones doing most of the cancelling are conservatives. Conservatives in this country have cancelled progressive taxation, have tried for 40 years to cancel public health and education, have cancelled any attempts to increase Newstart, been doing their best to cancel the NBN and have cancelled a price on carbon, any effective action on climate change, and tried in vain to cancel moves to allow gender equality. Most recently we had conservatives in New South Wales trying with all their might to cancel legal abortion. And of course the most egregious example of cancel culture in Australia was by the Australian newspaper, which used a short Facebook post by Yassmin Abdel-Magied as an excuse to hound her out of work and in the end the country. On the other side, progressives get annoyed when Alan Jones uses the N word, Sky News and the ABC interview Nazis or far-right extremists, and political parties continue to mouth platitudes about climate change and then seek to foster growth in the coal industry. And then we have the ALP\u2019s deputy, Richard Marles, stating that they are open to supporting new laws to outlaw the type of protest engaged by organisations such as Extinction Rebellion. A labour party not willing to stand up for the right to protest is one so utterly bereft of soul it has cancelled its own history. If you think the ALP has become beholden to leftwing university radicals, you probably think leftwing university radicals are still sitting around listening to U2. The ALP is devoid of the one thing that stamps out all progressive parties around the world \u2013 inspiration. In her speech, O\u2019Neil suggested the way to bring people together is by \u201cdefining and nourishing not who we are against but what we have in common\u201d and that \u201cJacinda Ardern\u2019s irrepressible likability and her vivid, genuine commitment to her country\u201d was a prime example. The problem, of course, is that there is no room for anyone like Ardern in the ALP leadership group. Were she in the ALP she\u2019d be told to wait her turn \u2013 such as occurred with O\u2019Neil, who is the same age as the 39-year-old Ardern but who dropped out of running for the deputy ALP position this year to clear the way for Marles. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rather than suggest Ardern is a way forward, maybe ALP types should ponder why Ardern exists in the NZLP and not the ALP. Ponder where, for example, is an Australian Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 because she sure as heck is not in the ALP. O\u2019Neil suggested her purpose is \u201cto seek out people in the community who don\u2019t share my views, listen to them and treat them with respect. Then I might be given the opportunity to have a real dialogue about Labor\u2019s perspective\u201d. But what is that perspective? She noted that \u201csome people say political correctness has gone too far, as cheap cover for racism and bigotry\u201d but then argues that \u201cnot every social change is inarguably a good one\u201d. OK, fine. Which are the bad ones? Much like political correctness going mad, it is easy to keep to generalities. O\u2019Neil referenced the time journalist Chris Uhlmann tweeted a photo of gender-neutral toilets at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. She suggested that the \u201cprime minister, who cannot find time to develop a coherent economic or energy policy, springs immediately into action. The crowd on Twitter fire up on their issue of the day. The toilet signage is changed. And the caravan moves on.\u201d Well yes, but the caravan didn\u2019t move on for those who are transgender. For them, all they saw was a conservative journalist and the prime minister band together to pick on them for reasons of spite while notionally progressive politicians thought the best response was to mock it as being a trivial issue not worthy of fighting. Cripes, show some spine. By contrast Paul Keating in 2007 said of John Howard celebrating that he had overturned political correctness, that \u201cin other words what he thought was really good was to be politically incorrect, you know, to be able to sling off at someone\u2019s colour or their religion, you know. And in a country of immigrants, this is poison for this society, poison for us\u201d. O\u2019Neil suggested this week that \u201cpolitics is about offering a compelling story about our country: who we are, where we are going. Then we talk about how we are going to get there\u201d. And yet, most voters would have no idea what the story being offered by the ALP is. Keating also noted that \u201cthe Labor party, in the end, it is an altruistic show. It always wants to do good. Now sometimes it does good better than other times but fundamentally it wants to do good, where the other show is poisoned by ideology and preference and special interests. This is not true of labour parties\u201d. That is a good place to start \u2013 but it needs to be supported by Labor MPs willing to stand up for altruism, be willing as Keating was to call out racism and defend those whom conservatives seek to marginalise and belittle. It needs progressives. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
