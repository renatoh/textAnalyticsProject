After more than a decade of pretty consistent failure at the highest level, a crushing defeat in Brisbane found commentators bereft of original long-term solutions to the problems of flawed captaincy, spineless batting and unreliable bowling. The usually tinkering suggestions were offered with an air of weary predictability, their merits obscured by the familiarity of the problem. And although some of the ideas might bear fruit over time, none addresses the urgency of the immediate problem. When Andrew Caddick miscued Shane Warne into Darren Lehmann's hands to end the match on Sunday, the clock started ticking. England's management suddenly had 10 days in which to turn things round before sending a team out for the second Test in a better frame of mind. Duncan Fletcher's blue-collar response to the crisis was immediate and wholly characteristic. \"We'll go straight into the nets,\" he said, \"and work on the problems until we've sorted them out.\" That, I suppose, is the difference between a coach and a manager. A coach takes the closest possible view and therefore sees the tiny blemishes that appear to stand in the way of perfection. A manager stands back and sees that everyone has blemishes and that what winners do is ignore or disguise them. No amount of concentration on the minutiae will put England in better shape a week tomorrow. The basic faults of men who have been playing the game since childhood should have been eradicated years before they got anywhere near a Test. Batsmen need advice every once in a while, to correct some acquired mannerism or other, and a spin bowler is never too old to add a new trick to his repertoire. But the sight of England's coaching staff sweating through what amount to intensive clinics merely sends a message of comfort to the opposition. England did not lose in Brisbane because their batsmen are playing down the wrong line to Glenn McGrath or failing to spot Warne's zooter. The bowlers did not allow Australia to get off to such a glorious start on the first day because of faults in their selection of line and length. Those errors occurred, and the match was therefore lost, because the batsmen and bowlers suffered a failure of nerve. Managers, coaches and captains can treat that problem only by working on psychology rather than technique. Having been patently unable to use the build-up to the series to instil confidence into the team, now Fletcher and Nasser Hussain need to compensate by removing the burden of guilt from their players. Australia are out to break their opponents' wills and the only way for England's players to counter their assault is to show a little willpower of their own. As Clausewitz said, attacks are most effective when directed at the enemy's centre of gravity; in this case he would aim straight for Australia's sense of superiority, which feeds on a defeated opponent's despair. Specific lessons from the home side should be limited to an appreciation of the value of approaching a match in a spirit of controlled aggression. It will have escaped the attention of no one who watched the first match that, like Alfred Neubauer's Mercedes grand prix teams of the 30s, Fred Allen's All Blacks of the 60s or Johan Cruyff's Ajax of the 70s, Steve Waugh's Australians have devised a new way to play the game and are daring their rivals to catch up. If Fletcher and Hussain need a little encouragement this week, they could look at the example of David Moyes, who has transformed Everton's fortunes to the point where even the rather washed-out blue of the players' shirts has taken on a more robust hue. Miracles do happen. And in this year of the invincibles - Schumacher, Armstrong, Woods - they might remember what happened in Los Angeles on Monday night, when Serena Williams fell to the spirited Kim Clijsters. Neither slumps nor winning streaks last for ever and sometimes they come to an end at the most unexpected times. Even the smallest achievement while the series is still in the balance will be to England's credit, if they show the right spirit. While never forgetting that, as professional sportsmen, they are required to prepare themselves properly, they should be reminded that the words \"game\" and \"play\" still apply to cricket, and they should be invited to start enjoying themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
