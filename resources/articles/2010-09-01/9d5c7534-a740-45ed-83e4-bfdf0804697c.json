Westwood, who has not played competitive golf for more than a month, is recuperating from a leg injury and Paul McGinley, one of Europe's vice-captains, conceded in an interview with the Guardian that the world No3's fitness will be \"an unknown factor until he turns up\". If Westwood is forced to withdraw from the 12-man team, his place is supposed to go automatically to the next man on the world points qualifying list, Edoardo Molinari. But since the Italian was one of Montgomerie's three captain's picks, another wild-card selection would be required, a European Tour spokesman confirmed. Inevitably, the spotlight would fall on Casey, who has risen to seventh in the world rankings, and Justin Rose \u2013 both of whom were controversially omitted. McGinley admitted that concerns about Westwood's fitness have boosted America's chances of retaining the Ryder Cup early next month. McGinley, who argued earlier in the summer that Europe were a far stronger team than America, revealed that there are still real anxieties about Westwood's readiness to play. \"A couple of months ago we were quite clear favourites,\" he said, \"but in the last two months things have changed. We have been hurt by Lee Westwood's injury. There's no doubt about that. It's going to be an unknown factor until Lee turns up that week and we see how he feels, having not competed since the Open. That's a disappointment for Europe. \"I also think the American team has got a lot stronger over the last two months and we've had some issues \u2013 none more so than Lee having been injured and not having played. He's our No1 player so I think it's going to be a very close Ryder Cup.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
