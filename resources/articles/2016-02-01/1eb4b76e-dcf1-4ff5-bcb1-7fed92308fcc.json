On Wednesday at 3.15pm Australian Eastern Daylight Savings Time (9.15am Mawson station time) the Aurora Australis broke free of its mooring lines during a blizzard. The ship is currently aground at West Arm in Horseshoe Harbour, near Mawson Station where it was undertaking a resupply mission. Its 67 expeditioners and crew are on board and safe and well, the Antarctic division said in a statement. \u201cThe ship remains watertight, with no damage to the hull of the vessel. Current blizzard conditions are hampering a full assessment of the damage, and the crew are closely monitoring the hull from inside the ship,\u201d it said. Sustained winds of more than 130km an hour were recorded before the ship broke its mooring lines. Blizzard conditions are forecast to continue for the next 24 hours. The Antarctic division said it was working with P&amp;O Maritime Services and the owners of the Aurora Australis to ensure the safety of all passengers and crew as a priority. The Aurora Australis departed Hobart on 11 January 2016 and has been undertaking marine science around the Kerguelen Plateau region. It arrived at Mawson for resupply on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
