Less than two hours later he was back in the changing room, celebrating the most glorious goalless draw in England's history with six stitches in his head. \"I feel like a black Terry Butcher,\" Ince said, but the blood-soaked bandage was merely an outward symbol. The pre-match nausea had told him all he needed to know about the special pressures that occur when England face a crunch match in a qualifying tournament. The draw ensured a passage to the 1998 World Cup finals for Ince and his colleagues. England had known exactly what they needed to do, and Glenn Hoddle - in his finest hour as a manager - concentrated all their efforts on achieving a straightforward aim. In the days before the match, Hoddle had employed black propaganda. David Beckham pulled out of final training session complaining of breathing difficulties, while Gareth Southgate did only light training. Both played, looking perfectly fit. \"Beckham did have a cold,\" Hoddle said afterwards. \"We played it up, yes, but he did have a cold . . .\" On the night, only Italy's fans needed handkerchiefs. Against opponents who had not dropped a point in their preceding 14 home matches, and whose starting XI featured the combined firepower of Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri, Filippo Inzaghi and Gianfranco Zola, England erected an impregnable barrier in which David Batty, patrolling in front of the back four as the linchpin of a midfield quintet, was the outstanding performer. \"We were very proficient and very intelligent,\" Hoddle said, and the critics concurred. The outcome cannot be as clear-cut tonight, when Steve McClaren's England face Russia at Wembley in a Euro 2008 qualifier. With four matches of their 12 remaining, Steve McClaren's squad may feel that last Saturday's 3-0 home win effectively dismissed the challenge of Israel, who are now level on 17 points but, having played a game more, lag behind in fourth place. Russia lie in second place with 18 points while Croatia top the table with 20, both having played the same number of matches as England. Perhaps it will all come down to the last round of group fixtures, on November 21, when Croatia visit Wembley, Russia go to Andorra and Israel entertain Macedonia. But the legacy of England's failure to beat Macedonia at home, and defeat in Zagreb, is that anything less than three points tonight would damage their chances of reaching next summer's finals. England have been here before during the Premier League era, and not just in 1997. Four years earlier, under Graham Taylor, they travelled to Rotterdam needing some sort of a result to give themselves a realistic chance of making it to the 1994 World Cup. After a 2-0 defeat, the manager was left cursing his luck. \"Taylor's players gave him spirit, determination and aggression throughout,\" David Lacey wrote in this newspaper the following morning. \"But the attack was too narrow, the midfield inadequate, and the guile that the suspended Paul Gascoigne would surely have provided never appeared.\" Against a team inspired by Dennis Bergkamp Taylor's players acquitted themselves well until they were undone by a moment of ill fortune. The match was an hour old and goalless when Ronald Koeman, the last defender, brought down David Platt, England's captain, on the edge of the Dutch penalty area. Koeman received only a yellow card and a minute later he was up at the other end, sending a 20-yard free-kick past David Seaman to knock the stuffing out of England before Bergkamp doubled the margin. Two points behind Holland and an unbridgeable six behind Norway, and still with only two points awarded for a win, England went to Bologna needing to beat San Marino heavily while hoping that the Dutch would lose in Poland. After putting seven goals past the amateurs, they learnt Holland had won 3-1 in Poznan. There was a better outcome in November 1999, when Kevin Keegan's team qualified for the Euro 2000 finals in a two-leg play-off by beating Scotland 2-0 at Hampden Park before losing to the only goal at Wembley four days later. And there was no respite in October 2001, when Sven-Goran Eriksson's England needed a point from their final group match against Greece in order to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Only a month earlier they had avenged the 1-0 defeat at the hands of Germany in the final match at the old Wembley, and four days after that 5-1 triumph in Munich they beat Albania 2-0 in Newcastle. Greece took the lead at Old Trafford and regained it a minute after Teddy Sheringham had equalised. The match was into its 93rd minute when Beckham's sixth long-range free-kick of the game assured England of qualification on goal difference - since Germany had failed to beat Finland in Gelsenkirchen - and himself of the BBC's sports personality of the year award. There will be no Beckham tonight - only Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and Emile Heskey remain from the 2001 squad - and there will be no sudden death or blinding miracle, but the gratitude of an apprehensive nation awaits the signal for yet another great escape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
