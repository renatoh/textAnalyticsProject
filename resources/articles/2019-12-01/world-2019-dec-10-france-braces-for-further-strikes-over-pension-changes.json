Rail-workers, teachers, air traffic controllers, doctors, national library staff and even ballet dancers marched through Paris and other cities to protest against the biggest overhaul of the French pension system since the post-war period. Numbers were down on last week\u2019s street protests when at least 800,000 people took part in one of the biggest demonstrations of trade union strength in a decade. But unions said the nationwide transport strike would continue. Philippe is expected to announce the details of the government\u2019s pensions proposals on Wednesday. But he downplayed the prospect of a speedy breakthrough in the dispute, saying there would be \u201cno magic announcements\u201d that would bring protests to a sudden halt. However, he suggested the pension changes could be gradual. Emmanuel Macron, the pro-business president who has promised to deliver the biggest \u201ctransformation\u201d of the French social model and welfare system in 50 years, sees his pension reforms as a key test. He has staked his political credibility on refusing to buckle in the face of street protests. Backing down would be to risk losing his support-base. But demonstrators said they feared France\u2019s social safety net was being unpicked. The government is concerned that protestors have taken to the street not just in big cities, but in small provincial towns, echoing the mood of the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protests earlier this year. People are angry not only with pensions but low salaries, worsening prospects, the state of public services and what one demonstrator called \u201cthe feeling of being forgotten\u201d. One local MP for Macron\u2019s party said it would be hard to tackle a protest movement that spread from pensions to several different grievances at once. Guillaume Bouslah, 32, a freight rail worker from the Paris suburbs, said: \u201cNo one is talking about stopping the strike. I\u2019ve already lost a week\u2019s pay. If we have to continue, we\u2019ll keep going, we feel supported by other professions and the public. The government clearly wants to boost private pension funds. Surely France should be defending its unique social model, not breaking it?\u201d Sophie, 48, a primary teacher in Essonne said: \u201cThe unease runs deep: a lack of staff in schools, low salaries and the feeling that public services are under attack.\u201d Across the country, transport turmoil continued with trains at a virtual halt, some flights grounded, 10 lines of the Paris metro closed and more than 180 miles (300km) of traffic jams on roads around Paris by 7am. In the greater Paris area, where more than 9 million people depend on an already overburdened public transport system each day, there were dangerous crushes on packed platforms. The government argues that unifying the French pensions system \u2013 and getting rid of the 42 \u201cspecial\u201d regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff \u2013 is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. But unions have claimed the changes are an attack on fundamental workers\u2019 rights, and fear people will have to work longer for smaller pensions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
