After that, we notified them that we no longer needed the insurance, and have bought it elsewhere ever since. We got notices about insurance from the Vernon, but paid little heed, as they weren't collecting any payments. Then in 2010 Vernon said we owed seven years' worth of unpaid insurance premiums, totalling \u00a31,944. They have no record of my cancelling the policy. They have now added the outstanding amount to our mortgage, taking an extra \u00a316 a month. NS, Sale, Cheshire Vernon says it always sent you renewal letters and every year detailed the outstanding premiums and that you should have realised you were still insured through them. It is understandable that you overlooked these as you had cancelled the policy and stopped paying premiums. However warmly a building society might feel towards its borrowers, I am surprised that Vernon continued to insure you for seven years. Vernon agreed this might seem odd but feels its actions did not conflict with its idea of positive long-term relationships with borrowers. Until now. When you complained Vernon cancelled the policy after seeing evidence you were already insured. It offered to ask the insurer to refund half the duplicated premiums, expecting your other insurers to pay the other half, for the past three years. But it won't do this until it sees confirmation you had been insured elsewhere. You appear to have difficulty producing any paperwork for previous years. I urge you to keep looking.
