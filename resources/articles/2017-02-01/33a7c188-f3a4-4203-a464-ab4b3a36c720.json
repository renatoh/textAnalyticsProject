The Department for Education is working with Oldham council to investigate allegations made by Trish O\u2019Donnell, head of Clarksfield primary school, that she feared for her safety after a string of alleged incidents that she labelled a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d plot to make her quit. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s claims were backed by the headteachers\u2019 union, NAHT, who said there was a \u201cvariety of apparent Trojan horse issues\u201d in the Oldham area. But the DfE said the investigation had nothing to do with extremism and \u201cshouldn\u2019t be referenced as Trojan horse\u201d, as did the council that produced a report into the claims. Those accused of being involved also reject the description. The term Trojan horse first rose to prominence in March 2014 after an anonymous letter to Birmingham city council alleged a plot by conservative Muslim groups to take over some of the city\u2019s schools \u2013 referring to a so-called \u201cOperation Trojan horse\u201d. After a number of inquiries, no evidence was found of violent extremism, but concerns were raised about school governance. According to the Sunday Times, a confidential report on Clarksfield by Oldham council this month said O\u2019Donnell claimed she had been subjected to a long campaign involving death threats. In an email sent to the council in December, O\u2019Donnell is said to have complained of enduring \u201charassment and intimidation\u201d in the form of \u201caggressive verbal abuse\u201d and \u201cthreats to blow up her car\u201d from people allegedly pushing conservative Muslim values. She wrote that she had \u201cvery strong reasons to believe that \u2026 a Trojan horse agenda [is] being played out\u201d. Issues arose in 2013 when Ofsted inspectors criticised levels of attainment at the school, where most of the pupils are of Pakistani heritage. The council report referred to the activities of Nasim Ashraf, a parent-governor at the time, who allegedly hosted \u201cIslamic teaching sessions\u201d on Clarksfield school premises while his wife, Hafizan Zaman, \u201cmade remarks to Asian staff members that they should be wearing a veil and covering their heads\u201d. The couple also allegedly took exception to Hindi music being played in class, were angered by sex education classes and were accused of intimidating staff and undermining the headteacher. The council reportedly said they tried to mobilise parents to \u201csecure changes at the school to reflect their interpretation of Islam\u201d. The report said officers believed the couple were trying to intimidate school staff and undermine the headteacher. It spoke of their \u201cextremely problematic\u201d behaviour in \u201cseeking to mobilise other parents and the wider community\u201d against O\u2019Donnell. The report said this did not constitute a Trojan horse-style plot and added that Ashraf was not an extremist and \u201cnot part of any wider conspiracy\u201d. There is no suggestion that he or his wife were involved in the threats of violence. Ashraf also denies any Trojan horse plot. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to keep an eye on things,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cThe school is still a failing school \u2013 we need to remove Mrs O\u2019Donnell and replace her with a better headteacher.\u201d In communication with the Guardian, his wife, Zaman, said she and her husband were seeking legal advice following the accusations and would be making a further comment shortly. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe are already aware of the allegations raised in the report and we are working closely with Oldham council.\u201d Oldham council\u2019s cabinet member for education, Amanda Chadderton, said: \u201cWe take any allegations about our schools very seriously. The report into an Oldham primary school found no basis to the Trojan horse allegations.\u201d Debbie Abrahams, MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said: \u201cAny allegations of harassment of teaching staff or of potential security threats must be taken seriously. \u201cWe must, of course, be vigilant to any issues that could conflate community tensions. This is why, along with the council, other Oldham MPs, organisations and leaders, we continually work across our diverse communities whilst tackling underlying inequalities which ultimately fuel these tensions. \u201cUnfortunately the new Prevent duty placed on educators to report people at risk of radicalisation is fraught with difficulties, as has been raised by David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
