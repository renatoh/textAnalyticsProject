The third day of the search for Sara Cooper, 45, a former childminder, was coming to an end when the body was found by a professional diver assisting police in the hunt. The body was recovered from an underwater cave at Cala Domingos on the headland just behind the hotel and then taken to nearby Porto Cristo, from where it was transferred for identification. Alfonso Jimenez Perez, the detective leading the search for Mrs Cooper, said last night: \"Absolutely all of the indications suggest that the body is Sara's. Sara's husband, Ian, will make a formal identification in front of a judge tomorrow morning at 9am. \"We had been looking for her since 10am ... All we know at the moment is that she had fallen into the water ... the sea carried her into [the underwater cave]. It seems she was in the water for two days.\" Mrs Cooper, from Foxton, Cambridgeshire, had not been seen since her seven-year-old daughter, Gianna, fell from the balcony of their hotel in Calas de Mallorca, the resort where the family was on holiday. In a statement the police said: \"We are looking at every hypothesis ranging from the theory that the woman may have pushed her child and then run away through to the idea that she saw her daughter had accidentally fallen and then left in a state of shock.\" The Cooper family took two rooms in the Samoa hotel, where the incident took place. Gianna and her mother were in one and her father and brothers, James, 13, and Jonathan, 11, shared another. The couple's eldest son Stephen, 15, was not on holiday with the family. Shortly before she disappeared Mrs Cooper is believed to have told the family that Gianna had fallen from the balcony. A source said yesterday the police were waiting to talk to Gianna, who has been in a medically induced coma since her surgery, following her 10-metre (30ft) fall. She was reported yesterday to be in intensive care in a serious but stable condition at Son Dureta hospital, in Palma de Mallorca. A police source said: \"We cannot interview [Gianna] at this stage and will not do so until we are given the go-ahead by doctors. Any interview would be extremely delicate.\" Ian Cooper, 44, earlier released a statement through the Foreign Office. \"I would like to thank the staff at the Manacor and Son Dureta hospitals in Mallorca for the excellent care they are giving to my daughter, Gianna, and the support they have given the family,\" he said. \"Gianna is now in a stable condition and she continues to improve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
