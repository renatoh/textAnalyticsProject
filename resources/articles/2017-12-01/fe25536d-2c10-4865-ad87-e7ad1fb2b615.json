Tina Gibson, of east Tennessee, was 25 when she gave birth to Emma Gibson in November. Emma grew from an embryo that was originally frozen on 14 October 1992. \u201cIf the baby was born when it was supposed to born, we could have been best friends,\u201d Tina Gibson told NBC News. The embryo was transferred into her mother\u2019s uterus by the National Embryo Donation Center, a faith-based organization in Tennessee. \u201cWe\u2019re just so thankful and blessed. She\u2019s a precious Christmas gift from the Lord,\u201d Gibson said, according to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re just so grateful.\u201d Frozen embryos are sometimes known as \u201csnow babies\u201d. After a couple goes through IVF treatment there are sometimes leftover embryos, which are frozen for potential later use. The National Embryo Donation Center encourages people to donate those embryos to other couples who are unable to conceive. The organization\u2019s website says it believes that life begins at conception and states: \u201cChristian faith is the overriding principle upon which we operate.\u201d It only donates embryos to a man and a woman, who must have been married for at least three years. The NEDC\u2019s Dr Jeffrey Keenan oversaw the embryo transfer. He said it was impossible to be sure whether it had set a record in the process of being born, but it was likely. \u201cWe had our medical library, which is very good at finding things, look to see if they could find anything older than that and they could not,\u201d Keenan told NBC News. \u201cBut it is kind of neat that this embryo was conceived just a year or so before the mother was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
