This television programme has been a long time in the making, with Panorama using material from Roger Buffham that was collected largely during his spell as the Jockey Club's head of security. If the Club do not like the invasion of privacy caused by the TV cameras, then they positively hate the fact that their former employee is spilling the beans about possible links between racing and criminals, or alleged criminals. As long ago as April, the Jockey Club told race courses that they should not allow Panorama access to film without obtaining permission from Portman Square, and crews who tried to film at Royal Ascot and York were thrown out, although they were permitted to take cameras into Warwick, the scene of a controversial two-horse race in 1996 during which the odds-on Man Mood was pulled up. The Club then attempted to obtain a court injunction against Panorama and Buffham, without success, and have been on the defensive throughout. The impression given is the usual one associated with the Club, of an ostrich with its head in the sand, an institution that refuses to move into the modern, media-friendly world. But, in short, one suspects that what they are frightened of is the harm programmes such as Panorama will do to the public perception of racing. The better way for the Club to have gone about things would have been to have opened their doors to the programme-makers, to show them the steps they have gone to to keep racing clean in recent years. Panorama producer Stephen Scott said: 'I was astonished at the extent of the corruption. This documentary will expose the biggest scandal in British horse racing since the Second World War.' That may be a piece of TV hyperbole to put bums in armchairs at 10.15pm next on Sunday, but the Jockey Club themselves are not unaware of malpractices in horse racing and they have taken positive steps to do something about it. In his Gimcrack speech in December 1999, the senior steward of the Jockey Club, Christopher Spence, said: 'A key to the future commercial success of racing is that there must be a justified belief in the underlying integrity of the sport. That requires firm regulation, both of racing and of betting. 'I do not believe the integrity of racing is under threats to which we cannot find the answers and I have no wish to be accused of scaremongering, but its vulnerability to criminal activity and corrupting influences through the betting it attracts needs to be addressed.' So, when Panorama came on the scene, asking questions and making a nuisance of themselves, as documentary-makers have to do to get themselves heard, the best thing for the Jockey Club to have done would have been to have asked them in for a cup of tea and shown them what they were doing about security with Buffham's successor, Jeremy Phipps, at the helm. Phipps, 60, a former SAS major-general, has said that part of his brief was to make sure that confidence in the Jockey Club, from professionals and the public, was not lost. He could have shown Panorama the new closed- circuit television cameras being installed to cover every stableyard at every race course, replacing outdated models. He could have asked them to join a dawn raid on stables, of which there have been several this year for random drug-testing after the suggestion that some trainers were using the drug EPO to make their horses more competitive. He could have introduced them to other members of his 65-strong team, including Robin Gow, a former jockey and trainer. After all, shortly after Phipps took over the reins, he said: 'We should be more overt rather that covert.' And Phipps's bosses could point to the Code of Conduct, issued at the start of 2001 prohibiting trainers from accepting 'special privileges or concessions', something the film- makers would have been most interested in because they appear to have 1996 letters from bookmaker Victor Chandler to trainers offering better than usual terms or even free bets. They could have shown the hands-on work that has gone on with the betting exchanges, which have sprung up recently offering punters the opportunity to lay horses as well as back them, thereby posing a threat to the integrity of the sport. But they chose instead to keep their heads in the sand, meaning that those cameras were thrown out at Ascot and York meetings in the time-honoured 'act first, ask questions later' tradition. Had the Club been more accommodating to the documentary-makers, the scandal that the Panorama team are promising us would have been toned down. Christopher Spence would have been able to say: 'We are the Jockey Club, we know skulduggery goes on in racing, but we are on top of it.' The problem with that way of doing things, of course, is that the Club would be admitting strangers over their threshold and that, it appears, is something they do not like doing. Just as the hunting fraternity insist that 'townies' cannot 'understand' hunting, so the Jockey Club do not want 'outsiders' trampling on their hallowed turf. John Maxse, the Jockey Club PR director, said of the programme: 'All we are seeking is a fair and objective study of the matter.' How much more objective the Panorama team could have been had they had the full support of the racing authorities. Spence said in April: 'The quality of people working for and with the Jockey Club is first class and I am very confident about the future.' I wonder how confident he is now. In the five months since then, the Panorama team have been putting together their programme, but Spence's organisation have missed the chance of working with them for the common good.
