In front of a visiting crowd that voiced their hopes for a brighter future, Steven Pressley's team demonstrated enough attacking vigour and ambition to prove they are worthy of a proper home from which to build. Coventry's spirit graced the evening, but Arsenal's moments of class ensured safe passage to the FA Cup fifth round. Two first-half goals from Lukas Podolski more or less settled the matter, and a pair of late strikes from the substitutes Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla added gloss. It was a satisfying night for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who last winter was outboxed in two cup competitions by lower-league opponents. Arsenal were set up to avoid any repeat of the shambolic FA Cup exit against Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates last season. They were powerful enough, and motivated enough, to exert control. The main points of interest were the return of three players who had been dogged by injury in the first half of the campaign, and need to make up for lost time by imposing themselves on this season of opportunity. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made his first start since the opening day of the season \u2013 in the central midfield position Wenger thinks is his best. Further forward, Nicklas Bendtner and Podolski were granted an opportunity to play themselves into form. The Dane endured one of those nights when there were more guffaws than applause. The German, on the other hand, seized the moment. Having reached the 15 minute mark at nil-nil, the Coventry contingent in the Clock End began to ol\u00e9 as their defenders cooly passed the ball among themselves, briefly the picture of composure. Arsenal responded to this apparent impudence with a deadly break. Mesut \u00d6zil clipped a disguised pass to the gallopping Podolski, who glided past Joe Murphy to steer in the opening goal from a narrow angle. Another goal made in Germany followed 12 minutes later. Serge Gnabry's inviting corner was glanced onwards by Per Mertesacker, and Podolski nudged in his second. He now has more goals (five) than starts (four) this season. \"When you have a goal chance you want him to have it. He has unbelievably short and quick backlift and [is] very accurate in his finish,\" noted Wenger. Hopes of a Coventry surprise felt pretty slim. Challenging as it is for the FA Cup to cling to old-fashioned romantic ideals, a moment to stir the soul came off the pitch rather than on it. A televised game gave the visitors from Coventry the opportunity to publicise their plight. They came with armfuls of printed protest notes about their ordeal, exiled from the Ricoh Arena in their heartland. In a show of solidarity, the Coventry faithful were given a standing ovation by the Arsenal support. \"Ultimately we want to get the football club back in Coventry,\" said Pressley. \"The fans have been right behind us. They are a pivotal reaosn why the team has perfomed so well this year.\" Coventry are 54 places beneath the Premier League leaders in the English game's pyramid, but despite the damaging scoreline, came out in the second half keyed up to take the game to their opponents. The speedy bursts of Leon Clarke, and the energetic and determined creativity of Carl Baker, inspired the League One side. Clarke saw one angled shot deflected by Lukas Fabianski's legs, and a venemous effort rattled against a post. \"I asked players to be brave in possession,\" said Pressley. \"Being 2-0 down at the Emirates it's easy to go under but we looked the likelier team to score. One thing for sure, for my young players, and some of the senior ones, it proved to them they can certainly play at a higher level.\" Such drive and ambition made him rightly proud. Wenger noted that Coventry's eye-catching spell coincided with the players who are working their way back to full fitness dropping physically. A couple of late changes punished Coventry at a time when fatigue took its toll on the visitors. Giroud and Cazorla finished with unerring accuracy, to turn the scoreline into a harsh one for Pressley to stomach. Wenger was pleased with a job well done, and found a moment to respond to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's critique of the Arsenal's manager's \"complaining\" about Chelsea's sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United. \"What I said was not a complaint. It was nothing to do with Chelsea. It was a just an opinion. I speak about facts and ideas, never about people.\" His focus is entirely on his squad, which was enhanced as two days short of his 17th birthday, Gedion Zelalem made his Arsenal debut. He is the first player born since Wenger took over to play for the club. Arsenal feel their future is bright. Coventry deserve a fair crack at one, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
