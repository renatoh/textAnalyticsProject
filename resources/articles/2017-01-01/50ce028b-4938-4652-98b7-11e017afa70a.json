Act two: the newspapers deliver their judgment on the judgment. In fact, the Brexit-supporting titles do not repeat the front page outrage with which they greeted the original high court ruling. Despite the decision, which confirmed that prime minister Theresa May must gain parliament\u2019s consent to trigger an exit from the European Union, they choose to see it in positive terms. Except, of course, the Daily Mail. It now turns its attention to MPs in the belief that a number of them are plotting to thwart Brexit. And it also seeks to pour scorn on Gina Miller, the woman who brought the case against the government. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page, while registering the fact that opposition parties will seek to thwart May\u2019s plans, is headlined \u201cThere can be no turning back\u201d. And the Sun, reminding its audience of another Conservative prime minister, asserts that the \u201cLady\u2019s not for turning back\u201d. Similarly, the Daily Express, always eager to ensure there will be no backsliding, quotes a Brexit minister who warns that \u201cMPs must not stop EU exit\u201d. Metro, predicting a swift political resolution, goes with \u201cReady Brexit\u201d... ... while the Financial Times reports on its front page that May will \u201ctable fast-track legislation to keep her Brexit plan on track\u201d. In the FT\u2019s view, the decision was \u201cthe most significant constitutional judgment for a generation\u201d and \u201ca triumph for Britain\u2019s judicial system and the supreme court\u201d. Noting that \u201cthe case has also been marked by intemperate and demagogic attacks on the judiciary\u201d it reminded its readers of the Daily Mail\u2019s \u201cenemies of the people\u201d headline. It commented sharply: \u201cThis argument is so grotesquely at odds with the facts and with the law that only a profound cynic, or a great fool, would profess it. \u201cMany people campaigned in good faith for Britain to leave the EU so that parliamentary sovereignty could be revitalised and important decisions about Britain\u2019s future could be brought closer to British voters. This is what the supreme court ruling has done.\u201d The i newspaper\u2019s main story, like the FT\u2019s, reports that the government will aim to pick themselves up quickly from this defeat. The Times is straightforward in noting that the supreme court judges made history in a \u201cBrexit blow to ministers\u201d. But the Guardian moves matters on a little by carrying a report about a coming split among Tory MPs about Brexit. The Guardian also thought the supreme court \u201cspoke for Britain\u201d in rejecting the government\u2019s appeal. In so doing it upheld the rule of law, \u201cnot the rule of ministers\u201d, which \u201cwas the right decision legally, constitutionally and morally\u201d. It regarded Gina Miller and her co-plaintiffs as \u201cthe heroes, not the villains, in this story\u201d. May had been wrong to appeal against the original ruling and parliament \u201cshould be much more courageous in holding her to account\u201d. In the Guardian\u2019s view, it is understandable that both the main parties are, like the voters, divided. \u201cBoth are unhealthily afraid of the bullying anti-EU press ... [but] it is parliament that is sovereign, not the referendum, let alone the Daily Mail.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
