About 100 protesters broke through a police cordon in an attempt to reach the platforms at St Pancras station. Police in riot gear used teargas and batons against the No Borders demonstrators, according to activists. Videos posted on Twitter show a melee with police officers trying to hold back a group of demonstrators until more than a dozen managed to break through onto the concourse. Once inside the station, some of the demonstrators held up a banner saying \u201cClose down Yarl\u2019s Wood &amp; all detention centres\u201d. Scotland Yard said they tried to enter the Eurostar platforms at the station, but were stopped by officers. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u201cSome protesters began to throw items at police, including smoke bombs. \u201cThese protesters were ejected from the station and later dispersed from the area.\u201d Demonstrators said two people had been arrested and that one person had been injured by police officers. Activists also claimed the demonstrators were subjected to kettling \u2013 a police tactic where groups that police wish to suppress are held in a tight cordon until being allowed to leave one by one. Pictures were published on social media sites showing police in high-visibility vests questioning people on the concourse of King\u2019s Cross station, just over 100 metres from the scuffles at St Pancras. Bystanders wrote of the chaos on social media. Joel Benjamin said: \u201cUtter carnage at Kings Cross station for migrants demo. Flares, Cops going in batons drawn.\u201d PhD student Theo Kindynis wrote: \u201cProtestors break through police lines at Kings Cross St Pancras. Protest in solidarity with refugees.\u201d British Transport police said demonstrators arrived at the station at around 6pm and began a peaceful protest, adding: \u201cAround this time a number of other individuals arrived at the station causing disorder and missiles, including smoke bombs, were thrown at police officers.\u201d It was the second pro-refugee demonstration to have taken place at St Pancras station this month after protesters threw fake blood on themselves and held up placards saying \u201cborders kill\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
