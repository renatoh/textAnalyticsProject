Now, we get Susan Boyle, G2, 20 September). But only in a design sense; to include Tessa Hunkin in your article is going too far. The mosaic craftsman treads a difficult path between a rock and a hard place. We need high-profile commissions which are our lifeblood, and we hope that our commissioners have the confidence and trust that we can design as well as we can create. Sadly, many clients departmentalise us and think that artists design and craftsman make. Actually, most craftsmen I know design and also make. Commissioning an artist to design for mosaic when they have no expertise in the medium is a folly. Mosaic artists have then to interpret the design and unless very strong-willed could be persuaded to \"copy\" the design without considering the material which will be its final form. This becomes so very obvious when you view the finished works. St Francis appears to be wearing a frat-house T-shirt emblazoned with the letter T. St David has obviously returned from Glastonbury sporting a groovy Peter Gabriel haircut circa 1975. The mosaic work is crude in style with the andimento (mosaic coursing) set in horizontal bands across areas like the arms and forehead rather than a linear flow (a more elegant style as evident in the better mosaics in the cathedral). This I am sure must be the dictate of the artist, not the mosaic craftsman. Oliver Budd President, British Association of Modern Mosaics \u2022 Germaine Greer compares the art of the Renaissance with today's modest offerings, lacing her snobbish criticisms with sneering sideswipes at Eric Gill and James MacMillan. She should know that many of the great artistic triumphs of the past were comissioned by popes such as Julius II who were \u2013 in her words \u2013 more \"morally bankrupt\" than Pope Benedict XVI. Bryan Rooney Buckhurst Hill, Essex \u2022 I'm fascinated that Greer, and all those wondering why someone such as Renee Fleming was not asked to sing for the pope's open-air mass, seem not to appreciate that Susan Boyle is among the most famous Scots in the world (Fleming is from the US), and is widely known for singing in her local Catholic church and on pilgrimages to Ireland. Even had Boyle not been famous there would be a logic to inviting her to sing at the mass. It's always nice to promote one of your own.
