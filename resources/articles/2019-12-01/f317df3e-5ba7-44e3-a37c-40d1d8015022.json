The club sought to limit any damage caused to its business in China, where it has numerous commercial interests including a chain of restaurants, by releasing a statement on Weibo \u2013 a leading Chinese social media site \u2013 as well as other platforms stressing it is apolitical and does not associate itself with \u00d6zil\u2019s views. \u201cRegarding the comments made by Mesut \u00d6zil on social media, Arsenal must make a clear statement,\u201d it read. \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d \u00d6zil had added his voice to the wave of international outrage about the treatment of the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who have been subjected to a campaign of religious and ethnic persecution by the Chinese authorities. Around 10 million live in Xinjiang and there are claims that more than a million have been held in detention camps over recent years. \u00d6zil\u2019s post had listed a range of the issues facing Uighurs in China, accusing other Muslims of staying silent on the subject. His Instagram message read: \u201cEast Turkistan, the bleeding wound of the Ummah, resisting against the persecutors trying to separate them from their religion. They burn their Qurans. They shut down their mosques. They ban their schools. They kill their holy men. The men are forced into camps and their families are forced to live with Chinese men. The women are forced to marry Chinese men. \u201cBut Muslims are silent. They won\u2019t make a noise. They have abandoned them. Don\u2019t they know that giving consent for persecution is persecution itself?\u201d It is not the first time \u00d6zil has become involved in social and political issues. His support for Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has caused controversy and he was widely criticised in 2018 after posing with him for a photograph. Erdogan was also best man at \u00d6zil\u2019s wedding in June. \u00d6zil is the second Arsenal player in as many days to air forthright political views on social media. On Thursday, with polls open for the general election, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn tweeted: \u201cYoung people across the world have a chance to change what the future can be. Today\u2019s the chance for all the British people to influence what your future and those living here holds. #FuckBoris #GoVote.\u201d On that occasion, the club did not issue a statement in response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
