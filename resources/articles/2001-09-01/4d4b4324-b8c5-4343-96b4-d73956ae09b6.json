The bill for the damage to just the buildings is likely to run into \"10s if not 20s of billions\" of dollars, said Robert Miller, spokesman for the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Other experts said compensation payouts could be as high at $10m per fatality. Risk managers said that disasters such as the $3bn Piper Alpha crisis and Hurricane Andrew were tiny in comparison. Experts were even questioning whether the attacks could be covered by insurance and asking whether governments worldwide would have to foot the bill at least in part. \"The big question is whether this is really an insurable event. There are huge implications for world economies especially if governments have to pay for it with large amounts of printed money,\" said a spokesman for the British insurer Ockham Holdings. Whatever the costs, experts say the disaster will result in the biggest insurance payout in history. A spokeswoman for the International Underwriting Association, which includes the main British insurers as well as Lloyd's, said: \"It's incredibly difficult to tell at this point what the costs will be. Lloyd's of London definitely has an exposure, as well as re-insurers across the City. It could be the biggest ever insurance claim.\" Lloyd's said it did not have information as to the losses which its market might face. The insurance market has been under pressure and recently announced \u00a31bn losses for 1998. At the time it said it expected to move into profit for the current financial year. Yesterday's events put a question mark over that confidence. HSBC insurance broker David Hudson did not rule out insurance company collapses following the crisis. \"They are likely to be the smaller companies.\" However, he stressed that the surpluses built up during the equities and bond market booms have left US insurers alone with $100bn of surplus capital. \"They should be able to weather this.\" CGNU, Britain's biggest insurer, said it had no direct exposure, after it pulled out of the United States property and casualty business earlier this year. The world's largest re-insurer, Munich Re, said that claims could be substantial but they would not threaten the company's financial stability. \"It is fair to say, based on early details that the damage claims for Munich Re could be considerable but that the group has already built in provisions, even for damages of this dimension,\" Munich Re's chief spokesman, Rainer K\u00fcppers, said. Rival re-insurer Swiss Re said it was too early to evaluate the crisis. The company said it was more concerned about the welfare of its employees, some of whom were based in the World Trade Centre. \"We will look at the costs over the next few days,\" said a Swiss Re spokeswoman. The World Trade Centre had been recently valued at $1.2bn but the insurers will need to add to the property damage their calculations of the cost of interruption to business activity over the coming weeks and months. The hijacked aircraft will have been insured - an airline typically has $1bn-1.5bn of liability cover, said Lloyd's Mr Miller, who added: \"The ones affected are going to need it.\" The cost of insuring airlines and property is likely to soar following the tragedy, say insurance analysts. In the US, terrorism is covered under standard property insurance and aviation policies. \"The future implication may well be that terrorism becomes a separately assessed coverage in the US and that property and aviation coverage becomes more expensive than hitherto,\" said one broker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
