He released a statement to the state broadcaster RTE saying he did not think it was in the best interests of the game, fans and players for him to return to Japan. \"I do not consider that the best interests of Irish football will be served by my returning to the World Cup. The damage has been done,\" he said. The Football Association of Ireland's treasurer John Delaney said the matter was now closed. Ireland's manager Mick McCarthy had suggested earlier yesterday that an apology from Keane might just be acceptable, thus leaving the door ajar for the player's late return to the squad before their opening game against Cameroon on Saturday. But Keane's statement appears to have drawn a line under the matter once and for all and he seems happy to let the players - and the management - in the Far East get on with the job. He wanted the players to be able to \"concentrate fully on their preparations for the competition, free from all further distractions. \"I wish the team and the management all the best. They have my full support throughout the competition and I urge all the people of Ireland to give their support to the team and I do not feel that any useful purpose will be served by my making any further comment.\" After Keane's emotional appearance in his RTE television interview on Monday evening, McCarthy made it clear the ball was in the former captain's court if there was to be any prospect of his returning to the squad from his banishment after the row in Saipan last Thursday. After Keane's statement, the former Ireland international Ray Houghton said: \"I think Mick would have accepted an apology. If there was one and it was sincere, I think Mick would have taken him back because he knows how important he is to the Irish squad.\" Houghton said he felt for the supporters. \"The fans, they are the ones I feel sorry for. A lot of them have gone into debt to go over to Japan.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
