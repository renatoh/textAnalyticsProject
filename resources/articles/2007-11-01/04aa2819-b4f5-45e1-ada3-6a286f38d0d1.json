The story was considered sufficiently important for the BBC's Today programme to lead with the item in its prestigious 8.10am slot. It had begun with a BBC interview. Sir Cyril Taylor, chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, was reported to have argued that up to 17,000 sub-standard teachers needed to be sacked. However, it was odd that in all the various bits of his interview I heard broadcast on the day, Taylor never actually used that figure, although it was attributed to him. Nor did he repeat it when interviewed live on the Today programme. I will come back to that. First, it is worth recalling that we have been here before. In 1995, the then chief inspector of schools for England, Chris Woodhead, called for 15,000 incompetent teachers to be sacked. Are there still as many poor teachers in our schools? And are headteachers still refusing to sack them? Somehow, I don't think it's that simple. Woodhead argued there were 15,000 incompetent teachers in total, about 7,500 in secondary schools and 7,200 in primaries. By contrast, Taylor was clearly talking only about secondary schools. Was he really claiming that the problem has doubled since 1995? After all the reforms in teacher training and the changes in school structures and management - including the fact that the majority of secondary schools are now specialist schools or academies - is it really possible that there are twice as many poor secondary school teachers as in 1995? Taylor stressed he was not producing new figures, but was relying on statistics from Ofsted's latest annual report. So, it was not exactly \"new\" news, though it was presumably considered newsworthy because of his strong criticism of headteachers for failing to sack poor teachers. So, let's look at that Ofsted evidence. The annual report said 10% of secondary schools were \"inadequate\". That is about 350 schools with about 400,000 pupils. Ten per cent of all secondary teachers in England would amount to about 17,000 teachers. Perhaps that was how Taylor reached his figure? But is it really fair to say that every single teacher in every \"inadequate\" school is sub-standard? According to Ofsted, it is not. In the same annual report, Ofsted also said that just 5% of secondary teaching was \"inadequate\". On that basis, we would have the rather more modest figure of 8,500 to 9,000 \"inadequate\" secondary school teachers. To be fair to Taylor, he gave the 5% figure in his Today interview and he also praised the \"great majority of excellent teachers\". But what is the effect on teachers, students and parents of this superficially shocking statistic of 17,000 poor teachers in charge of hundreds of thousands of pupils? In questioning this, my purpose is not to dismiss the need to do something about poor teachers. It would be utopian indeed to pretend that none existed. Where they do, they need help to improve. If they really cannot become more effective, they should leave the classroom, since children get only one chance at education. But do we really need to get ourselves into another moral panic by this sort of extrapolation of statistics? It is, of course, easily done. No one gets very excited about a figure of 5% of teachers being poor. Indeed, how many professions would better that figure? But turn that into 17,000 teachers and 400,000 pupils, and you can see why some think this makes good headlines. Taylor is right to be concerned about the 300 or so schools that are deemed \"inadequate\". But quite how the reporting of this story jumped from his expressions of concern to headlines such as \"axe for 17,000 bad teachers\" is hard to fathom. I am sure it does nothing to bring clarity and focus to the important debate about teaching quality and school standards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
