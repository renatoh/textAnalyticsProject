The Boston-based billionaire has been accompanied on the trip by the former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry, who left the club during the near-ruinous reign of George Gillett and Tom Hicks, and watched Al Wasl\u2019s game with Ajman on Wednesday. Liverpool are not believed to be the only topic on Henry\u2019s agenda in Dubai but, with planning permission recently granted for a new \u00a375m Main Stand at Anfield, and Fenway Sports Group increasing the club\u2019s commercial revenue since taking over, his visit in the company of Parry raises the prospect of a new sponsorship arrangement. Meanwhile, Liverpool have released three of the club\u2019s scouts as part of an overhaul of their scouting network. Alan Harper, Mel Johnson and Mike McGlynn have all parted company with the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
