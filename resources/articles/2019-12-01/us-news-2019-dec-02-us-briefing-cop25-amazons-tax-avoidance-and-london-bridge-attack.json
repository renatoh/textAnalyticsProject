UN chief praises youth \u2018leadership\u2019 over climate emergency As delegates from across the globe descend on Madrid for the start of the two-week COP25 climate summit, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has contrasted the inaction of the world\u2019s governments with the \u201cleadership\u201d shown by young people on climate. The annual summit is smaller than expected, after plans to hold the event in Santiago were scrapped amid Chile\u2019s political unrest. The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members face inundation by rising sea levels, issued a plea ahead of the summit, urging developed countries to take their plight seriously. \u2018World War Zero\u2019. Former Democrat secretary of state John Kerry has launched a bipartisan coalition of high-profile power-brokers hoping to address the climate crisis. Fossil fuels. Fossil fuel lobbyists are trying to water down planned EU rules designed to prevent so-called \u201cinvestment greenwashing\u201d. Meanwhile US insurers have joined their European counterparts in withdrawing cover for coal projects. Amazon accused of \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d tax worldwide Amazon and the five other major US tech firms have been accused collectively of \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d $100bn in global tax over the past decade. The online retail giant is named as the worst offender of a group that also includes Facebook, Google, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft, in a new report by the tax transparency campaign group Fair Tax Mark. The report found the firms moving revenue and profits through tax havens or low-tax countries to avoid tax, and delaying the payment of those taxes they do incur. World\u2019s richest. Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos is currently the world\u2019s richest person, paid just $3.4bn in tax over a decade during which it recorded revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn, according to the report. Trump and lawyers refuse to attend impeachment hearing Donald Trump and his lawyers have refused to take part in the house judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearings this week, after complaining about a lack of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d to the proceedings. The White House had been given until Sunday evening to say whether the president would send a legal representative to take part in the panel\u2019s consideration of possible articles of impeachment, which would see him charged with misconduct over his dealings with Ukraine. \u2018Unfair process\u2019. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to committee chairman Jerry Nadler, saying Trump could not be \u201cexpected to participate \u2026 while it remains unclear whether the judiciary committee will afford the president a fair process\u201d. Rudy Giuliani. Despite his protestations to the contrary, the man once known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d appears to face ever-increasing legal jeopardy over his involvement in the Ukraine scandal, as Tom McCarthy reports. Johnson accused of politicising London attack as election issue Boris Johnson has been accused of twisting the facts of Friday\u2019s London Bridge terror attack for electoral purposes, against the express wishes of the family of Jack Merritt, one of the victims. The UK prime minister blamed the Labour opposition for the release from prison last year of the suspect, Usman Khan. As the UK intelligence service MI5 began an inquiry into the attack, investigators said they believed Khan, 28, had acted alone and may have acquired the materials for his attack as little as 24 hours beforehand. Former associate. A former jihadist jailed with Khan over their 2010 plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange \u2013 and who, like Khan, had been released on licence \u2013 was arrested on Saturday over a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Ex-offenders. Two former offenders, included a convicted murderer, were among the members of the public who intervened to thwart Khan\u2019s attack. Cheat sheet Four police officers and 17 cartel gunmen have been shot dead over the weekend in Villa Uni\u00f3n, a town in Mexico\u2019s Coahuila state, fuelling a debate over Donald Trump\u2019s recent designation of Mexico\u2019s drug cartels as terrorist organisations.

The artist Tal R is waiting for a Danish court to decide whether a pair of art world provocateurs who recently purchased one of his paintings will be allowed to cut up the canvas to use as decorative faces for a line of limited edition luxury watches. Must-reads Liam Payne on life after One Direction Liam Payne was once known as the most vanilla member of the world\u2019s biggest boyband. But behind the scenes, he says, \u201cI was slowly losing the plot.\u201d Elle Hunt hears about his battles with alcohol and the pressures of young fatherhood. Big brother is watching in Chongqing China has just introduced a rule requiring all mobile phone users to submit to a facial recognition scan. But that sort of privacy invasion is nothing new to residents of Chongqing, the world\u2019s most heavily surveilled city, which has one CCTV camera for every six of its residents. Matthew Keegan reports. How Biden helped create the student loan problem On the presidential campaign trail, Joe Biden has repeatedly promised to fix the student loan crisis, which has saddled 45 million Americans with crippling debt that now totals a staggering $1.5tn. What Biden doesn\u2019t mention, writes Ed Pilkington, is his own role in creating that crisis. Kim steps out of his grandfather\u2019s sartorial shadow In the early years of his leadership, Kim Jong-Un dressed as if in homage to his popular grandfather and North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung. But in recent months he appears to have expanded his wardrobe and embraced a more ecletic personal style, says Justin McCurry. Opinion Donald Trump\u2019s presidency coincides with a growing public distrust in the commercially driven media. But with the facts under siege, says Robert Reich, now is the time to invest in journalism that exists solely to serve the public. Trump\u2019s lies and ongoing attacks on his critics in the media score points with his base but at the expense of a weakened democracy. If a large enough portion of the public comes to trust Trump\u2019s own words more than the media\u2019s, Trump can get away with saying \u2013 and doing \u2013 whatever he wants. When that happens, democracy ends.
