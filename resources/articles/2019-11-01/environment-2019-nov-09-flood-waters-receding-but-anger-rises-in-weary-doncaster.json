It sounds like the present continuous tense, ominous and ongoing. Twenty-four hours earlier, the body of Annie Hall, a former high sheriff of the county, had been found. She had been swept away by the River Derwent at Darley Dale, not far from Matlock. If that fatality lends a tragic note to the floods that hit the east Midlands and northern England on Friday, the streets are awash with many more mundane stories of hardship. Though the flooding has now subsided in most areas, in Doncaster people are still struggling to cope with the aftermath. In Bentley, a low-lying neighbourhood on the north side of the River Don, forlorn terraced streets are still knee-deep in water. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a hydrologist to see what\u2019s happened,\u201d a man named Paul tells me. \u201cSheffield built flood defences in 2015-16. They spent about \u00a320m protecting the lower Don. So the water has nowhere to go than the next place, Rotherham and then Doncaster.\u201d In Yarborough Terrace, the whole street remains under two feet of water. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky compared to the houses at the end,\u201d says one resident, Lee Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s come into the conservatory, but it\u2019s what\u2019s under the floorboards that\u2019s the worry.\u201d He says that residents received a \u201cred alert\u201d on Thursday night that there was a risk of flooding. He phoned an emergency number and requested sandbags. He was told that the council was not going to distribute them because the River Don\u2019s banks had not been breached. On Friday morning, the Don had burst and the street was filling with water, but all Smith could get was an answer machine message. \u201cThey brought the sandbags maybe four or five hours after the street had been flooded,\u201d he said, shaking his head. There is a lot of frustration and anger in the surrounding streets about the slow response, particularly because the area flooded in 2007. The locals speak about a \u00a315m European grant they say was awarded after that flood to build river defences. \u201cWhere did that go?\u201d asks a woman called Eve. \u201cBecause they clearly didn\u2019t put it into the areas that needed it.\u201d Some people, such as Terry Braithwaite, another inhabitant of Yarborough Terrace, say that although the council was late reacting, it was \u201ca tremendous help\u201d once staff arrived on the scene. Others complain that they brought far too few sandbags and left residents to handle the distribution. Smith speaks glowingly of the efforts of the community, who all pitched in to help one another. But he makes special mention of a teacher from outside Doncaster named Mark Ibbertson, who arrived in a wetsuit with his son, Logan, and a boat, and set about rescuing people from their houses. \u201cHe needs putting up for an award,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe was fabulous.\u201d We think of floods in a different way to how we think of fires. The latter may be created through malice or negligence. But a flood we see as more of an act of God. It is no coincidence that the adjective \u201cbiblical\u201d is often used to describe heavy rain. However, in 21st-century Britain, scene of summer droughts and hosepipe bans, it does seem a little hard to credit that major towns are still vulnerable to floods, and that the system waits for an event to take place before implementing a strategy to limit its effect. What is clear is that many people in flooded areas are hit twice: first by the flood and then by insurance companies unwilling to insure them. A couple of loss adjusters going door to door tell me that insurance companies put their premiums prohibitively high to discourage people from seeking cover. No one I speak to in Bentley has insurance. One resident tells me that \u00a31,200 a year was the lowest quote he got for insurance after the 2007 flood. \u201cYou do the maths,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s over \u00a314,000. That\u2019s more than I\u2019ve lost in this one.\u201d I go into Tina Wallett\u2019s bare council house in Wrightson Terrace. She is a single mother of three and she has been up since 5am removing ruined carpets and carrying her furniture and belongings upstairs. \u201cThe neighbours were amazing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the council that were shit, to be fair with you. We didn\u2019t get sandbags until after the water was in the house.\u201d The police, too, come in for some criticism for their lack of active involvement. I see a number of officers standing around, but they seem to be protecting the police tape that has been put up to block off the roads. \u201cI\u2019ve got an 18-year-old son who was paddling up here all day yesterday getting sandbags for people,\u201d says Gary Davison on Conyers Road. \u201cAnd the police accused him of pinching sandbags! The police were just stood about. I didn\u2019t see them carrying or helping anyone.\u201d Davison\u2019s garden, bequeathed by his late father, was destroyed, causing \u201cthousands of pounds of damage\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m on UC [universal credit],\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford insurance.\u201d A few streets away, word goes out that the floodwater is rising again on Frank Road. Sure enough, the road is submerged and the water level is rising up to the raised doorways. \u201cThis is now no longer nature doing this,\u201d says Steven McDoughall, watching his street, which was dry in the morning, succumb to the threat of flooding once more. The residents say the Environment Agency has pumped water from another village into a ditch that runs behind Frank Road and that ditch is now overflowing. No one is sure what is going to happen. Someone says she has phoned the council and they don\u2019t believe there is water in the street. It\u2019s not biblical. It\u2019s not dramatic. It may not even be a consequence of the climate crisis. But the flood that hit England last week has made life a lot more difficult for many people who didn\u2019t have it easy in the first place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
