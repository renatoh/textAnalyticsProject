The Australian loose forward, playing his first game after missing 12 matches with a shoulder injury, lasted just 90 seconds before a wincing 33rd-minute tackle by Paul Noone knocked him cold. Smith returned midway through the second half to play a token role, but by then Hull had given the Wolves a salutary lesson in anger management by wrapping up a win to lift them to fourth place in Super League. The incident was placed on report by referee Russell Smith and will be viewed on video by the Rugby Football League today, when Noone is likely to be summoned to appear before the disciplinary committee tomorrow. Noone's challenge sparked fears that Smith had smashed his shoulder but Hull's coach Shaun McRae said Smith had come through the clash virtually unscathed. The match began in fractious fashion with both teams conceding a succession of penalties, Hull's attempts to slow down Warrington proving the most costly as they fell 4-2 behind. Missing their usual goal-kicker Lee Briers, the Wolves turned to Rob Smyth and Graham Appo, who each landed a penalty after Paul Cooke had opened the scoring for Hull. Cooke also added the conversion to a fine try by Colin Best after putting the winger through on the right with a floated pass, edging Hull ahead with a second penalty before Warrington claimed a try from Appo. The departure of Smith spurred on Hull to produce their most effective play of the opening half which ended seconds after Graeme Horne had extended their advantage with a well-worked try that saw his brother Richard, Cooke and Best combine in brilliant style. Cooke could not convert but he found both line and distance soon after the restart when Best's opportunism brought him a crucial try, the Australian plucking a risky pass from Nathan Wood out of the air and racing away to touch down from 70 metres out. The sin-binning of Appo for holding down Kirk Yeaman effectively ended Warrington's hopes of a win, as Hull took control with tries by Richard Fletcher and a second for Graeme Horne. Brent Grose grabbed a late consolation try for Wolves, converted by Appo, but Hull finished the stronger and, after Cooke had kicked another penalty, the Australian second row Sean Ryan, who is set to join Castleford at the end of the season, pounced for his side's sixth and final try.
