'Royal parks,' explained a sniffy retort, 'are for families and not for homosexuals.' Happily, the gentleman with the monogrammed secateurs has now retired. He won't see next Saturday's London gay pride march culminate for the first time in a fiesta near the banks of the Serpentine. The Christian Institute - just wait - will condemn the 'cavorting' and 'flaunting' of a 'libidinous minority lifestyle' so close to the heart of the capital. (Even before someone explains to its gay-bothering followers that police officers from across Britain will be joining the parade in uniform for the first time.) But resonant evidence that gay is finally becoming mainstream, in spite of the institute's anguished howling, is furnished by the line-up of artists who will take to the Pride in the Park stage on Saturday. Not only will Liberty X and Mis-Teeq be there, so will Sarah Brightman and the Cheeky Girls. Could the latter be an even more solid test of cultural integration than the presence of 75,000 partygoers? Not only are the cool lined up to sing, but the utterly uncool, too. It hints at where gay politics now resides. There was a time when we knew exactly what gay direct action meant. Angry demos, sit-ins and Guardian readers dashing into Benetton to unfold all the neatly stacked jerseys before the security guard noticed. Just 20 years ago, the most positive public register of homosexuals was of camp game-show hosts - harmless, distant and certainly nowhere near the children - and an occasional newspaper snap of a man in a dress. In 2003, gays and lesbians live next door, teach at the local primary school and carry ministerial red boxes unremarked. The school bullying, the verbal abuse and the attacks go on, particularly away from the tolerant acceptance of inner London, Manchester or Brighton. Stonewall research has found that almost one in two gay people under 18 has experienced violence because of their sexuality. This still needs to be addressed. But one of the most potent - and unremarked - political changes taking place for gay people in Britain is their treatment in other areas once considered hostile. All too many workplaces are crucibles of unsatisfied ambition and unsettled scores heated by overlong hours and unremarked effort. Add half an ounce of prejudice, even inadvertent, and what might be a mundane working life becomes a misery. Many of Britain's largest employers have not only recognised this but are now seeking to address it. The most progressive are not necessarily in the public or voluntary sectors. JP Morgan is explicit about its motive for supporting minority staff. It's not only that it wants to reflect its client base. An investment bank's most valuable asset is human capital. If it doesn't recruit the brightest graduates to work for it, regardless of colour or sexuality, it will yield its place as a market leader. By next month, 10 FTSE-100 companies, with almost one million staff, will be working with Stonewall on diversity, as equal opportunities is now monickered. Next week, IBM will fly selected staff from Britain to a 'global lesbian and gay leadership conference' in New York. The diversity sought by these businesses has benefits for majority communities, too. JP Morgan says that it doesn't just want to recruit the sharpest lesbians, gay men and minority ethnic staff from new graduates. It acknowledges that it won't recruit the sharpest white heterosexuals either if the workplace doesn't resemble the real world in which young Britons enjoy living. The era of Edwardian workplace values, when Mr Banks left his wife and Mary Poppins at home with the children, is not only being rendered quaint. Those who still yearn for it are riding a handcart to commercial hell. Thousands of homosexuals, like their heterosexual counterparts, embrace ethical consumerism, too. They quietly move their bookings away from companies such as British Airways or Stagecoach, where figurehead directors or proprietors have backed discrimination in the past. Why go jersey-jiggling and upsetting the underpaid security staff at Benetton if you can give the finance director of BA a headache instead? That's gay direct action today. Eight years ago, the Commons debated the right of gays to serve in the military. Tory MPs derided the idea as a 'poofters' charter'. Nevertheless, this year's Iraq war was the first time that dozens of openly gay soldiers saw active service. The Ministry of Defence confirms that there was not a single instance of the compromised operational effectiveness warned of so darkly by backbencher Iain Duncan Smith, among other 'military experts', in 1995. Ten days ago, the House of Lords accepted repeal of the notorious Section 28, the offensive piece of the 1988 Local Government Act which derided long-term gay relationships as 'pretend'. The silence from the usual suspects was deafening. The Daily Telegraph, campaign newsletter for the section's supporters who had warned of all sorts of fantastical dangers to children, failed to rally. It must be dispiriting to find your prejudices undermined, your certainties dashed so swiftly. It still means that some - we must always remember the Church of England in our prayers - respond with the frustrated aggression of those the world has left behind. But for millions of gay people, the public platform on which those arguments have been rehearsed in the last 20 years has given them a visibility and a sense of civic respect for the first time. Gays and lesbians might have secured the right of everyone else to stay out of prison for having sex at 16. Long overdue civil partnership may be on the horizon. But in 2003, they have also at last won the right - even if the wish to exercise it might seem unaccountable - to pay \u00a325 to hear the Cheeky Girls sing in Hyde Park. Gay people no longer have to be 'flamboyant', 'entertaining' or 'interesting' to satisfy other people's objectification of them. Increasingly, they can feel free simply to be naff. (Apologies to the Cheeky Girls.) And ordinary. And - whisper it softly for fear of awakening those who like to monopolise our collective vocabulary - normal. Just like everyone else. \u00b7 Ben Summerskill is chief executive of Stonewall"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
