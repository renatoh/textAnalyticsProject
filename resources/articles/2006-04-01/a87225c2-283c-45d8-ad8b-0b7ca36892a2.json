There I was, ball at my feet, feinting and flying down the wing, when suddenly I was a small heap on the ground. For once a right full-back declined to step nicely aside and I was clattered, muddied, felled. I didn't want my mum exactly, but I did want sympathy. Instead, I lost my innocence. \"Get up, David!\" urged my teacher from the touchline, bellowing like Bambi's dad. \"Get up!\" This was non-swinging England in the late 60s, small-town schoolboy football in what remained of the Somerset coalfield. Permissiveness was something clever people discussed on telly, and George Best, with his dark tresses and jaguar hips, seemed of a wholly new sexual species. In such a time and place, my teacher had no need to spell out his deeper meaning. There was no shame in being knocked over. But to show it hurt you was to be a girl. My, how the game has changed. Big football's current great debate concerns how to eradicate from the field of play the widespread sharp practice of diving - pretending to have been fouled when you have not - and the related sin of feigning injury in order to trick referees into punishing opponents. Naturally, everyone in authority condemns such cheating. Naturally, the culprits do it anyway. There are subtler variants on these forms of dishonesty too: \"going down\" when only lightly fouled if doing so might \"win\" you more - a penalty or free kick - than staying upright would; taking longer than you need to recover from a minor injury in order to waste the other team's time. All the ploys above were rare among the football heroes of my boyhood. Not that top players didn't bend or break the rules back then - they did, and would soon begin to do so more cynically. None the less, some standards were different then. An unofficial code of conduct allowed certain flagrant transgressions to be justified as backhanded forms of honesty. Every team had its clogger and every other team knew why he was there - to fairly and squarely kick lumps out of your fancy ball-player. But diving, \"making a meal\" of being hurt, pretending to be injured when you weren't? Such forms of behaviour would have been seen as weak and wily, as contaminated by the \"feminine\". Now, though, in the privacy of the dressing room, they are tacitly - if not openly - condoned. They are all \"part of the game\", part of what \"professionals\" do to win. They are no longer the marks of a sissy. Instead, they've been coopted into manliness. The rise in the British game of what was once condemned as girlish has been ascribed to various things. The replacement of the Corinthian sporting outlook by the unscrupulousness of an ultra-competitive, big-money industry is an obvious umbrella cause. Xenophobia notwithstanding, so has the influence of some foreign players. But it also tells us something about what masculinity actually is when athletes as self-consciously blokey as professional footballers have so completely adopted habits that their predecessors would have considered irredeemably, shamefully, womanly. The lesson is that what we think of as being masculine can change - does change, unendingly, even in football's macho world. As a public presence David Beckham remains the great exemplar. On the pitch, for all his artistry, he is a warrior. Off it, he moves into \"women's space\". It all goes to show why today's endless media-facilitated stream of not-so-scientific \"findings\" insisting that masculinity is some measurable quality \"hard-wired\" into men's brains, hormones and genes, always obscures rather more than it reveals. If gender is so fixed by nature, why is it now ruthless and butch to hurl yourself to the turf and writhe there like a dying swan when 30 years ago it meant you were a fairy?
