Not surprisingly, it was the bookmaker's worst rugby result in its history. It also highlighted the growth of betting on rugby union, a sport most layers consider to be below the likes of formula one and American football in terms of turnover. Munster won last year's tournament after heart-breaking final defeats in 2000 and 2002 and they are 10-1 chances to retain the trophy - something that has only been done once before, by Leicester in 2002. Stade Fran\u00e7ais supporters can tell similar hard-luck stories, after both Toulouse in 2004 and Leicester three years earlier came from behind with minutes remaining to snatch European glory from the Paris club. But Stade, terrific value at 8-1 with Coral and Ladbrokes, can make it third time lucky in 2007. Fabien Galthi\u00e9's side are 11 points clear at the head of the French championship, having won 10 of 11 fixtures so far and they have been one of the most consistent teams in Heineken Cup history. As well as two lost finals, Stade can boast one semi-final and three quarter-final appearances since 2000. Their generous outright odds are probably due to a tough draw. They are general even-money favourites to win Pool Three, in which they will come up against English champions Sale (generally 11-8 to win the pool and 11-1 with SkyBet outright), Ospreys (6-1 generally and 50-1 with Paddy Power in the pool and outright betting respectively), who effectively knocked Stade out of last year's event, and Calvisano (250-1 with Paddy Power to top the section and 5000-1 with SkyBet to win the competition). Stade, still smarting from last year's early exit, should come through, though, and have the talent and ambition to go all the way. Biarritz, beaten in the final last year and semi-finalists in the two previous campaigns, are 7-2 favourites with SkyBet while three-times champions Toulouse are second in the market at 5-1 with Blue Square and Paddy Power. And with Stade Fran\u00e7ais third in the betting there is more than a decent chance that French domination of the competition is set to continue (they have had a representative in all bar two of the 11 finals). For those who prefer to back a French winner without picking one specific team, Ladbrokes offer 4-5 about a team from across the Channel lifting the trophy. Sereli Bobo is the 8-1 favourite in Paddy Power's tournament top try-scorer market. The Biarritz wing scored six tries in last year's competition as did Toulouse's Vincent Clerc (16-1 this year) and Felipe Contepomi (33-1) of Leinster. But I like the look of Mark Cueto at 16-1. The Sale wing has five Guinness Premiership tries this term and scored three in last year's competition. With a better showing expected from his team, he looks great each-way value. The most interesting pool is definitely Pool Four, in which champions Munster are general 5-4 favourites to win, former champions Leicester are next best at a general 6-4, resurgent Cardiff are 9-1 with Betfred and dangerous outsiders Bourgoin 14-1 shots with Sporting Odds (SkyBet go just 5-1). Munster's terrible domestic form in the Magners League - they've won just twice - makes them worth betting against so the selection is Leicester. On Sunday the pair play at Welford Road, where the Tigers have not lost a domestic league game for 28 matches, in what may turn out to be the early pool decider.
