Yet dozens of families with children affected in this way are helping each other through a national network called 1Voice. The group was established by Katie Clarke, mother of a disabled daughter, and speech therapist Tamsin Crothers after they saw gaps in the support for families with disabled children whose speech has been affected by conditions from cerebral palsy to profound deafness, and who use \"alternative and augmentative communication\", from hand signs to computer speech systems. Clarke says problems include isolation and frustration: \"The children and their families are often very excluded from ordinary family life. They have to cope with extremely complex lives, plus learn about technology.\" 1Voice volunteers run family support weekends, while its teenage project works on issues around self-esteem and identity to give young people a voice. The charity hopes that winning a Guardian Charity Award will raise awareness among the public and professionals of the issues and barriers faced by non-speaking disabled young people and their families. Teenage 1Voice members want to use the \u00a36,000 prize money to design, produce and distribute a DVD and leaflet with \"top tips\" on how to involve non-speaking disabled young people in making a difference in their community. The new PC that the organisation has won will immediately be used to produce newsletters, update the website and tackle admin tasks. For the future, the charity wants to find funds for a development worker so it can reach more children and involve more families. Liz and John Moulam say their daughter Beth, 12, has gained enormously from meeting others using communication aids: \"It's her support group - she calls it 'my world' - so she can be involved with people who understand how she is coping every day,\" says Liz. \"She is going to have a successful life because she knows others in her situation who have had a successful life. She has achieved that with 1Voice - there is no other charity quite like it.\" 1voice.info"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
