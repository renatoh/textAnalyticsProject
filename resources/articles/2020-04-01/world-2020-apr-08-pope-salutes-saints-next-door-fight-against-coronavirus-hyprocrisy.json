With characteristic frankness, the pope said he struggled with \u201cself-preoccupation\u201d in a largely solitary existence. \u201cOf course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there,\u201d he said in an interview published in the Catholic weekly the Tablet. He added: \u201cI\u2019m thinking at this time of the saints who live next door. They are heroes \u2013 doctors, volunteers, religious sisters, priests, shop workers \u2013 all performing their duty so that society can continue functioning. How many doctors and nurses have died! How many religious sisters have died! All serving \u2026 If we become aware of this miracle of the next-door saints, if we can follow their tracks, the miracle will end well, for the good of all.\u201d Responding to questions put to him by Austen Ivereigh, the British author of a papal biography, Francis spoke of the hypocrisy of politicians who talk about facing up to the coronavirus crisis sweeping the globe while failing to tackle the environmental emergency, supporting a \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d, and continuing to manufacture weapons. \u201cIt\u2019s true, a number of governments have taken exemplary measures to defend the population on the basis of clear priorities. But we\u2019re realising that all our thinking, like it or not, has been shaped around the economy. \u201cIn the world of finance it has seemed normal to sacrifice [people], to practise a politics of the throwaway culture, from the beginning to the end of life \u2026 It\u2019s a culture of euthanasia, either legal or covert, in which the elderly are given medication but only up to a point.\u201d The coronavirus crisis put a spotlight on people\u2019s values. \u201cI am worried by the hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons. This is a time to be converted from this kind of functional hypocrisy. It\u2019s a time for integrity. Either we are coherent with our beliefs or we lose everything.\u201d The climate crisis had been forgotten in the focus on the pandemic, he said. \u201cWho now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods? I don\u2019t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature\u2019s responses.\u201d He added: \u201cToday I believe we have to slow down our rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world. We need to reconnect with our real surroundings \u2026 \u201cLet us not lose our memory once all this is past, let us not file it away and go back to where we were. This is the time to take the decisive step, to move from using and misusing nature to contemplating it. We have lost the contemplative dimension; we have to get it back at this time.\u201d This was the moment to focus on the poor, the homeless and those on the margins. \u201cBut the poor are hidden, because poverty is bashful. In Rome recently, in the midst of the quarantine, a policeman said to a man: \u2018You can\u2019t be on the street, go home.\u2019 The response was: \u201cI have no home. I live in the street.\u2019 To discover such a large number of people who are on the margins \u2026 They are there but we don\u2019t see them: they have become part of the landscape; they are things.\u201d In Europe, he said, \u201cwhen we are beginning to hear populist speeches and witness political decisions of [a] selective kind, it\u2019s all too easy to remember Hitler\u2019s speeches in 1933, which were not so different from some of the speeches of a few European politicians now\u201d. Pope Francis described life under lockdown in the Santa Marta residence, where he lives. \u201cWe now have two shifts for meals, which helps a lot to alleviate the impact. Everyone works in his office or from his room, using technology. Everyone is working; there are no idlers here. \u201cHow am I living this spiritually? I\u2019m praying more, because I feel I should. And I think of people. That\u2019s what concerns me: people. Thinking of people anoints me, it does me good, it takes me out of my self-preoccupation. Of course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there. \u201cI\u2019m living this as a time of great uncertainty. It\u2019s a time for inventing, for creativity.\u201d People could \u201ceither get depressed and alienated \u2026 or we can get creative\u201d. But it was not easy to be confined to the home, he said. \u201cThe counsel is not to give up, but save yourself for better times, for in those times remembering what has happened will help us. Take care of yourselves for a future that will come. And remembering in that future what has happened will do you good.\u201d Asked if he had a message for the elderly who were self-isolating and for confined young people, he said: \u201cThe elderly continue to be our roots. And they must speak to the young. This tension between young and old must always be resolved in the encounter with each other. Because the young person is bud and foliage, but without roots they cannot bear fruit. The elderly are the roots.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
