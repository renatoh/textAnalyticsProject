We will leave aside the fact that Cleese lives in the Caribbean. His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain\u2019s capital. For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen\u2019s Year 3 will open there \u2013 a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London\u2019s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project\u2019s photographers have captured the full range of the capital\u2019s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros. There is a transfixing power to these pictures when laid out together. You are struck by the sheer size of the capital, its diversity in every manner \u2013 the full force of its vast and vital nature. It is hard to see how one could look at these kids, standing in rows, wide-eyed and wide-smiled, and come away with a sense of moral panic. But you know it is out there in this moment of parochial anxiety, dislocation and division. In a city with virtually the same number of non-white people as white British people (according to the last census, in 2011, London was home to 45% who described themselves as \u201cwhite British\u201d, as opposed to 40% who did not describe themselves as white at all), it provides a snapshot not just of the present, but of a future that would leave the likes of Cleese thinking: \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a telescope and microscope situation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it\u2019s also reflecting back on you, making you think: \u2018Who am I in all of this?\u2019 It\u2019s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There\u2019s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.\u201d Getting them there was no small feat. \u201cWe spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,\u201d says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition\u2019s curator. \u201cVery early on it became clear that you couldn\u2019t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.\u201d They needed the consent of every child\u2019s parent or guardian. Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. \u201cSome schools felt they didn\u2019t have the time or the capacity,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cA lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.\u201d So the Tate had to work out an \u201coffer\u201d, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project. Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cThe hope is that they come, they\u2019ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.\u201d When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs. There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class \u2013 embedded into their brood \u2013 with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. \u201cWe had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,\u201d explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light. The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them \u2013 in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork. There was little retouching \u2013 chipped walls remained chipped. \u201cI love that fact that there\u2019s a similarity,\u201d says McQueen. \u201cEveryone is regimented in the same way. There\u2019s conformity. But there\u2019s individualism, too. Each one is an individual. They\u2019re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there\u2019s still that spark there, that individuality, that questioning.\u201d This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing. \u201cIt\u2019s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform. It\u2019s not that you lose them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a whirlwind and they have to stand up in it. And the ones that can\u2019t stand up often get chopped down and disregarded. And at the same time those that can also try to sustain a bit of themselves within that system. So you see the potential and possibility in these kids\u2019 lives.\u201d The initial idea, he says, came from his own experience of primary school, which he remembers as a time of wonder, boundless energy and fearless freedom. \u201cIt was incredible. The friends I had, and the potential, the possibilities. Playing, drawing, the kinship of friends, experimenting, getting wet in the rain. I had the chance to daydream. But then you think of what could have happened and where people I knew had gone to.\u201d The whole thing makes for quite the rabbit hole. You start by looking at a picture, your eye drawn to the biggest smile, the tallest kid, the goofiest look or the teacher at the centre, who collectively offer a less diverse demographic than the children (they are mostly women), but are varied nonetheless. You scan that class, then another, then another, thinking of how unlike your own school they are, or how similar, and before long you are reaching back to yourself at that age. To how big things were and how small your world was. Trying to remember who your teacher was, or your best friend, or your arch-enemy. Recalling the more troubled kids and wondering what happened to them. What happened to any of them. Some might be grandparents by now; some could be millionaires. I have scant memories of class photo days, but I remember the sequence of events that made them unique to me and my family. The teachers would give us a letter to take home saying the photographer would be in on a certain day. I would lose it or forget it. I would generally be scruffy (that was and still is \u2018\u201cmy look\u201d), my hair a mass of tangles and knots. When the photos came back, I was always easily identifiable. I am the same age as McQueen but grew up in Stevenage in Hertfordshire and was generally the only black kid in the class. I would take the picture home and this would be the first my mum would know that a picture had been taken. She would hit the roof, pointing out how my dishevelment shamed her, sigh, and then say, \u201cI like this one\u201d and remark on my dimples or say I had my father\u2019s smile. She would buy a ridiculous number to \u201csend home\u201d to Barbados and they would take their place along with the dresses, fabric, trousers and linen she hoarded for the same purpose and that never made the journey. For McQueen, who has two children, it is also a love letter to the city where he was born and raised. He has spent much of the last two decades in Amsterdam, but loves London. \u201cI need this city because it\u2019s given me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s given me my belief system. It\u2019s given me my viewpoint on life.\u201d It hasn\u2019t always loved him back. As McQueen progressed through the secondary system during the early 80s, he felt the walls closing, seeking to bury that sense of possibility under the dead weight of institutional racism. Simultaneously laughing and shaking his head, he mentions Tam Joseph\u2019s painting UK School Report, which consists of three portraits side by side. The first, of a black youth in school blazer and tie, with a neat afro, is captioned: \u201cGood at Sports\u201d; the second youth is funkier, slightly older with twists and an earring, and reads: \u201cLikes music.\u201d The last has long locks and an open shirt above the words: \u201cNeeds surveillance.\u201d \u201cBy the time I got into high school things had definitely changed,\u201d says McQueen. This is partly why he chose year 3. It is at seven or eight, he says, that children start to shed their solipsism and navigate the structures that shape their world. \u201cIt\u2019s a limbo. It\u2019s the first time these things are being introduced to them like race, class and gender. How do they grapple with that? I don\u2019t know.\u201d If that is a challenge for the kids, it is also a challenge for London. With the interview over, McQueen \u2013 a man of few, well-chosen words \u2013 circles back to finish a thought. \u201cThis is the future. They have to make it work. They don\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d Steve McQueen Year 3 is a partnership between Tate, Artangel and A New Direction. The Tate Britain exhibition runs from 12 November to 3 May 2020. An outdoor exhibition, organised @Artangel, is on billboards across London until 18 November. #Year3Project"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
