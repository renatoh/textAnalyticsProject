Despite coming into this game in the bottom three they had already beaten the champions St Helens here and yesterday denied Leeds the chance to displace Saints at the top of the table despite failing to score a try in the second half. Hull led 14-6 at half-time thanks to a dubious penalty from Danny Tickle and an even more questionable try from Matt Sing followed by a single, uncontroversial effort from Shaun Briscoe. They extended that advantage to 10 points when Tickle maintained his 100% record over four attempts with a 43-metre penalty in the 60th minute. But Leeds spent much of the last quarter pounding the home line, cutting the deficit with a superb Brent Webb try seven minutes later but unable to penetrate the desperate home defence again. \"It was a very brave and committed effort, which is an improvement,\" said Hull's coach Peter Sharp. \"It was a bit reminiscent of last year, so maybe we're finding a little bit. We are desperately searching for the consistency the top sides have got, but we showed today we can mix it with them.\" This was Hull's first home league match since the defection of the playmaker Paul Cooke across the city to Hull KR, and after Rovers' stunning win at Wigan on Friday they needed the points to climb back above their rivals. They are still missing Cooke for his creativity, composure and especially his kicking, but Sharp praised a much-improved performance by his former half-back partner Richard Horne and an encouraging effort by Tommy Lee, an 18-year-old who has been thrown in at the deep end. However, Hull's best players were two of their overseas contingent. Out wide the Tongan second-row Willie Manu was a real handful for the Leeds defence and the hooker and captain, Richard Swain, kept up his average of more than 40 tackles a match with a rock-solid performance around the rucks. \"He's a warrior, there's not too many like him,\" said Sharp. \"He really is outstanding and a good bloke to have around the place. Leeds were left to reflect on the number of key decisions that went against them in the first half. Their supporters were convinced that Tickle's penalty had gone wide, then Sing's try seemed to come from a clear forward pass by Craig Hall. The Rhinos hit back when Jamie Jones-Buchanan collected Kevin Sinfield's flat pass on the sixth tackle, but then their stand-off Danny McGuire was sent to the sin- bin for allegedly trying to delay a Hull restart - although the referee Ian Smith's decision seemed both pedantic and harsh, especially when compared to the leniency he showed Hull's more obvious time wasting late in the match. However, the Leeds coach Tony Smith was remarkably philosophical afterwards, perhaps recognising that the luck his team enjoyed in their controversial victory over Bradford in Cardiff two weeks ago had run out. \"The game has gone, and there is nothing you can do after it to change those things,\" he said, a clear dig at the continued bellyaching about those Cardiff decisions by certain Bradford officials - which is in danger of making their club a laughing stock. \"You just cop them,\" Smith added. \"You have your weeks when you get the decisions and weeks when you don't -you've got to roll with them and be good enough to overcome them. We weren't good enough to do that today.\" Leeds have now lost twice already in Hull this season and thanks to the vagaries of the fixture list they are back again next Sunday for a second away game against Hull KR. That is another cause of frustration at Headingley, but something else they will suffer in silence. Their best moment yesterday came when the former Hull prop Jamie Thackray set Clinton Toopi free and he combined coolly with the young substitute Jordan Tansey for Webb to touch down near the posts. However, in the absorbing 13 minutes that remained the closest Leeds came to an equalising score was a thrilling scamper down the touchline by their diminutive scrum-half Rob Burrow, with Hull's full-back Briscoe racing across to pull off a fine cover tackle. That effort summed up Hull's spirit - the key to this victory, and the reason why Sharp must now be feeling a little more optimistic about the rest of the season than he has for some time.
