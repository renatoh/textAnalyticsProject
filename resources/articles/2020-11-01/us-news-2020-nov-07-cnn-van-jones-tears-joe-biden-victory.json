CNN was the first of the TV networks to call the election for Biden and moments after they did so the anchor, Anderson Cooper, asked Jones for his thoughts. Jones began to speak, stopped, gathered his thoughts and then said with heavy emotion: \u201cWell it\u2019s easier to be a parent this morning. It\u2019s easier to be a dad this morning. It\u2019s easier to tell your kids, \u2018Character matters, being a good person matters,\u2019\u201d Jones later posted a clip of the moment on Twitter. Jones then broke down and, with tears running down his face, continued, \u201cAnd it\u2019s easier for a whole lot of people. If you\u2019re Muslim in this country, you don\u2019t have to worry that the president doesn\u2019t want you here. If you\u2019re an immigrant, you don\u2019t have to worry if the president is happy your baby has been snatched away or send dreamers back for no reason.\u201d Jones continued, making no attempt to hold his emotions, carried on, \u201cThis is vindication for a lot of people who really have suffered. \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d That was not just George Floyd. There were a lot of people who felt like they couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d He added: \u201cI just want my sons to look at this. It\u2019s easy to do it the cheap way and get away with stuff, but it comes back around. It comes back around and it\u2019s a good thing for this country. I\u2019m sorry for the people who lost, for them it\u2019s not a good day. But for a whole lot of people it\u2019s a good day.\u201d Actor Mark Ruffalo was among the thousands on social media who applauded Jones for his words. NBA star LeBron James also tweeted approvingly. James was active throughout the campaign by leading a voting rights organization called More Than a Vote. Two years ago Jones was criticised by some on the left for working with the Trump administration on criminal justice reform. In 2018, Trump ratified the First Step Act, a bill which he said includes \u201creasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets\u201d. At the time, Jones told CNN host Dom Lemon: \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to give him some credit. I say the 99 times I don\u2019t agree with the president I\u2019m going to give him hell. But on this one, I\u2019ll give him a salute and applause.\u201d Jones came to prominence as an adviser to the Obama administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
