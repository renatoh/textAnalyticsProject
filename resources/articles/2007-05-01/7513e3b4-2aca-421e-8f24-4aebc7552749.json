Last week, George Bush was musing to a White House visitor about his first proper encounter with the chancellor. He was quite impressed. \"I'd been expecting a dour Scotsman,\" he admitted. His visitor warned him, \"Don't worry, you'll find Gordon does do dour.\" But he has been trying his best to be relaxed, open and friendly and, in contrast to the insiders' stories of tantrums and Whitehall Stalinism, Brown has started well. Aside from the hilarious mistake of an autocue placed so that he was two-thirds hidden - and that was the consequence of his poor eyesight - Brown's opening pitch got pretty good reviews. People liked the promise of learning from mistakes and of listening. His first policy promises - to restore powers to parliament and to build eco-towns for first-time buyers - were well-judged: it will be hard for the Tories to find anything substantial to criticise. Yet the next few weeks are going to be hard for Brown. It is a curious situation. Tony Blair is still very much in Downing Street, announcing the results of major policy reviews and touring the world. He is in office, if no longer quite in power. His obituaries have been written, yet he is still warm and breathing. Brown, meanwhile, is fighting a leadership contest that isn't. His decision to tour the country and listen is perhaps the only one open to him. He can't yet lead the country, and he can't yet really declare his agenda without treading on Blairite corns. For make no mistake, although Blair has given a full, if staccato, endorsement, and though all those ministers with hopes for their own future have sent in messages declaring they have always, really, held the chancellor in the highest regard, there is plenty of bitterness in the Blair camp. He told one close friend recently that he had wanted to stay on until 2008. On Thursday night, the uber-Blairites gathered at the home of his former adviser Anji Hunter for a wake. I'm told that the feeling that Blair was pushed, and that this is all the consequence of last September's attempted coup, the betrayal of a successful leader, was strongly expressed. The trouble is that while Brown can be sensitive and wary for a while, he cannot afford to tread warily for long. The country gave notice that it had fallen out of love with Labour this spring, and there's a lot of ground to make up. He has to mark himself out as different, to admit mistakes - he made a start yesterday, coming close to admitting he got the budget presentation wrong - and to startle bored and cynical voters with something new. The key to the strategy as it's being discussed by Brown's allies is to divide the Blair legacy into two. There will be \"bad Blair\" - the thespian preening, the love of wealth, the obsession with spin and image, the lack of philosophical substance and even the smugness. All of that is inherited, it's argued, by David Cameron, as glossy, well-off and PR-driven as you could imagine. Then there's \"good Blair\" - the record of public-service investment, the minimum wage and flexible working, the idealism, and ambition for change. That's inherited by Brown. What Blair feels about being divided down the middle, like James Bond strapped on a table as the laser beam approaches his groin, remains to be seen. Nor can Brown so easily disassociate himself from spin, or from the great disaster of the Blair years: the Iraq war. Yet it is a plausible, sellable strategy. The image of a government of ordinary people, unfazed by glamour or celebrity, will be central to the reshaping of the Brown cabinet. Brown's constitutional reform plans may not be big box-office stuff, or populist, but they will help draw a line under the worst aspects of the Blair court. In giving parliament new powers, he is likely to invite the opposition parties to take a full role in constitutional talks, an invitation they can hardly turn down, yet which makes it harder to portray him as a tribal control-freak. Alistair Darling and Geoff Hoon, as unflashy as they come, will be closely involved, the former almost certainly as chancellor. Darling is one of Brown's genuine inner circle. Hoon, a close friend of his, has begun the process of proper apology and analysis of the Iraq disaster. Following Brown's visits to the Middle East, we can expect a major economic initiative and a clearer announcement about troop withdrawals. Jack Straw wants to go back to the Foreign Office and has been running a foreign office in exile over the past year, keeping in touch particularly with developments in Iran. But as one of Brown's closest friends put it to me, \"Gordon's not stupid - of course he's going to open out to the Blairites. He has to and he knows it.\" That doesn't mean those who have attacked him personally and ferociously can now dictate terms, but it does mean, for instance, that David Miliband is regarded as a huge asset who must be given a big job. On the other side of the party, there are leftwing MPs who may unexpectedly find themselves invited in. And while I get no hint yet that Brown wants to invite a Lib Dem to the cabinet table - at least until a general election result dictates that he must - I wouldn't be surprised to see someone from business or the former Tory MP, now Olympic fixer, Seb Coe given a job. What of the deputy leadership? Brown has studiously avoided backing anyone, but the former front-runner Hilary Benn's star is waning and, according to a survey for yesterday's The World This Weekend, Harriet Harman is the current front-runner. Phones have been hot all weekend as each camp struggles for votes, but Harman is picking up some heavyweight support. Today, she can expect the endorsement of Neil and Glenys Kinnock, along with Alistair Darling and Douglas Alexander. The latter two, both enthusiastic hands-on parents, recognise the importance of the agenda that Harman has made her own: parenting and the work-life balance. Interestingly, she has already identified the next big political issue: how families and society care for the elderly. Brown knows that this is going to be a tricky period, and in the end voter reaction will be more visceral. Can he drop the controlling temper and the compulsive fiddling? Can he start to speak plainly, to listen and to apologise? The signs are good, though there is a way to go till he speaks totally fluent human. For once - and only on that subject - Bush may be speaking for the majority. jackie.ashley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
