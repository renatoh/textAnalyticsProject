This gesture by the centrally-contracted men\u2019s players is the equivalent of a combined 20% pay cut for the next three months but allows them to have a say in where some of the money goes, with the squad set to decide their chosen charities in the next week. The money, which comes from the Team England Player Partnership that distributes their pay and bonuses, has been described as \u201can initial donation\u201d and follows talks led by Joe Root, the Test captain, and Eoin Morgan, his limited-overs equivalent, on Friday. A statement issued by the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association read: \u201cThe players will continue to discuss with the ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] the challenging situation faced by the game and society as a whole and will consider how best to support the ECB and both the cricketing and wider community going forward.\u201d The PCA statement also confirmed that England\u2019s centrally-contracted women\u2019s players have volunteered a three-month salary reduction that, while unspecified, is in line with those taken by their coaches. Heather Knight, the England women\u2019s captain, who has signed up to be an NHS volunteer, said: \u201cAll the players felt like it was the right response in the current climate to take a pay cut in line with what our support staff are taking. We know how the current situation is affecting the game and we want to help as much as we can. We will be discussing with the ECB further ways we can help the game in the coming weeks.\u201d The moves by both sets of players are entirely voluntary and come while talks are ongoing between the 18 first-class counties and PCA regarding salary cuts for domestic players. The majority of clubs are understood to be furloughing their squads under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. The scale of the issue facing cricket was underlined by the ECB unlocking \u00a340m of emergency funding for the counties this week and making a further \u00a320m available to the recreational game in the form of grants and interest-free loans. Upon announcing this rescue package Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, warned that the sport faces the \u201cbiggest challenge in its history\u201d and estimated losses in the region of \u00a3300m should the entire home season be wiped out by the pandemic. There are, however, plans afoot for matches to be played behind closed doors in what have been labelled \u201cbio-secure\u201d conditions. Steve Elworthy, the ECB\u2019s director of events, has stated that internationals could potentially be staged within four weeks of getting the green light from the government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
