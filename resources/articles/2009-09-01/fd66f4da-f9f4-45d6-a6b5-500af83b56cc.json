He admits that, in terms of the result, \"God smiled on us\". If so, He wasn't the only one smiling. It was a good day out, Wray is back in love with his project, heartened by the involvement of the South African consortium he now shares ownership with, and he wants to see more of Wembley. \"I've always thought it would be great to play half a dozen games here a season,\" he said, \"so that Wembley became like a second home.\" There is talk of hosting South Africa there in a midweek game this autumn, and Saracens are trying to stage at least two other games this season. \"We play Leicester around New Year, and if Wembley is available, which I believe it is, my vote would be to get on with it. I've always felt the whole world wants to see Wembley, and if we can get a family of four there for \u00a330 or \u00a340 that's unbelievable value.\" What is more, Saracens have recorded two wins from their opening two games of the season, and the first was in front of nearly 70,000 at Twickenham. This is uncharted territory for the club that used to play in front of a few hundred on a park near Cockfosters. \"I couldn't but think about sitting in Bramley Road 14 years ago with Michael Lynagh, who was wearing a hood so he wouldn't be recognised. It was pouring with rain, there was mud everywhere and about 1,200 people there. I thought, he's never going to join us.\" Lynagh was there on Saturday as a pundit amid the sunshine and gleaming girders. He admired the spirit of his former club in holding on for the second week running to a fast-diminishing lead.It had been a ferocious encounter that neither side particularlydeserved to win, but Saracens did get away with murder at the end. Soane Tonga'uiha charged for their line with just over a minute remaining and touched the ball down on it, before Saracens ripped it away. For good measure, Courtney Lawes followed up to touch the loose ball down again. Both efforts looked good but it was understandable when the referee looked upstairs for confirmation. Dave Matthews, the television match official, has some explaining to do to a seething Northampton camp. To everyone else in the stadium and those watching at home on TV, it seemed obvious that the try was good, not once but twice. But when the gods are smiling on you, who is a TMO to buck the trend?
