In a hard-hitting meeting in Zurich, Fifa acceded to Uefa demands that it withdraw a controversial document outlining its proposals for a new transfer system and allow European football's governing body to assume full control of how the system can be amended to comply with European labour laws. The Fifa president Sepp Blatter was told by Uefa's president Lennart Johansson that unless Uefa's demands were met and the EC notified that the document would be withdrawn, Uefa would open direct negotiations with the EC and introduce its own transfer rules and regulations. Yesterday's meeting between Blatter and a Uefa delegation lasted just over two hours and left the top man in world football in no doubt that unless he conceded, relations between Fifa and Uefa would be irreparably damaged. The meeting was called after Fifa unilaterally submitted its own transfer proposal - that players should be allowed to move on three months' notice - to the EC last week, causing widespread anger within European football and prompting rumours of a possible split. Blatter apologised to the Uefa delegation and agreed to the formation of a new task force on the transfer issue which will be made up of Uefa's vice-president Per Omdal and chief executive Gerhard Aigner as well as Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen Ruffinen. In another major climbdown, Fifa has agreed that Omdal will have the final say on all matters and that nothing can be agreed unless it is rubber-stamped by him. Omdal, who is also president of the Norwegian FA, is a close ally of Aigner and a firm believer in Uefa's position on what shape the transfer system should take. The outcome of yesterday's meeting leaves Uefa firmly in the driving seat on the transfer issue and is a major victory for the organisation after its recent duel with Fifa. Even though both organisations attempted to paint the row as a spat within the football family and merely a mistake by Fifa, the outcome highlights the economical and political clout of the European game and its overall importance to world football. Much behind-the-scenes work has been carried out by Premier League officials, who enlisted the support of Tony Blair and other European politicians to bring pressure on Fifa and ensure the Uefa line would succeed. Fifa and Uefa also agreed that a joint document submitted by both of them last October would form the basis of future negotiations for the drawing up of proposals. Blatter admitted yesterday that he had made a mistake. He added: \"There has been a lot of trouble concerning the non-paper we sent to the EU. A lot of noise has been made in the media and the football family. But we have settled our differences, and negotiations with the EU will return to those based on the original document submitted on October 31.\" The new Uefa-led task force will meet next Tuesday to refine its proposals before meeting the EC next Wednesday. It will concentrate on two major points contained in the Fifa document that caused so much anger within European football. The first is about contractual stability and ensuring that players honour contracts for longer than three months, as initially proposed by Fifa. Second, Uefa wants to see a better compensation system than the one proposed by Fifa. Uefa's director of communications Mike Lee said: \"Contracts and compensation for us are sources of priority. \"We are looking forward now. There are no recriminations here; clearly Fifa made a mistake, and we are moving forward on a constructive basis.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
