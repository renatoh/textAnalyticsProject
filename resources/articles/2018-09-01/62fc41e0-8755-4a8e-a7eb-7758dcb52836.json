On Thursday, Australian judge Geoffrey Muecke, sitting as a judge of the Nauru supreme court, delivered a swingeing judgement permanently staying the trial of the so-called Nauru 19, charged over a political rally held at Nauru\u2019s parliament in 2015. The demonstrators, including a former president of Nauru, were some of hundreds protesting the banning of several parliamentarians from taking their seats in parliament for giving interviews to foreign media. Muecke said the prosecution of the Nauru 19 was \u201ca shameful affront to the rule of law\u201d and that the Nauru 19 could not receive a fair trial in the country because the executive government had already decided they were guilty, and would do whatever it could, and spend whatever money it had, to convict and jail them. \u201cMy conclusion is that the executive government of Nauru does not want these defendants to receive a fair trial,\u201d Muecke wrote. \u201c\u2026 the executive government of Nauru wishes only that they, and each of them, be convicted and imprisoned for a long time, and that the government of Nauru is willing to expend whatever resources, including financial resources, as are required to achieve that aim.\u201d Justice Muecke found that the Nauru 19 had been \u201cblacklisted\u201d by the government, and that the Australian lawyers who defended them pro bono had been abused, racially vilified and threatened. He accused the justice minister, David Adeang \u2013 who has unilaterally removed three magistrates and judges for making decisions the government did not agree with \u2013 of corrupting the justice system he was sworn to uphold. \u201cIn my judgment, the findings and conclusions to which I have just referred constitute a shameful affront by the minister for justice to the rule of law in Nauru, which he professes to operate for and give protection to the citizens of the country.\u201d But a spokesman for the Nauruan government said Muecke\u2019s decision was wrong in law and needed to be corrected by an appeal. \u201cThese are important matters which must be decided before a court of law in our country. The effect of this decision is that the evidence against the defendants cannot be brought to light.\u201d Once the government lodges its appeal, the case will go before the newly-constituted Nauru court of appeal, which this year replaced the Australian high court as the apex appellate court in the Nauru justice system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
