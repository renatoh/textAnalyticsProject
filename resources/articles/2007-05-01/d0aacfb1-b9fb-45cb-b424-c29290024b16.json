Jewell, the manager who led Wigan into the Premiership for the first time in their history, has reservations about remaining at the JJB Stadium for a third successive top-flight campaign and may decide to sever his ties while in a position of strength. He has been thinking along these lines for several months and it is clear that Wigan's chairman, Dave Whelan, will have his work cut out persuading the 42-year-old Liverpudlian to stay. Jewell, in essence, believes it will be difficult to take Wigan any further than he already has. He has a strong emotional attachment to the club, and a close relationship with Whelan, but the idea of a fresh challenge appeals to him and he is frustrated by their low gates. If Jewell does leave, it will be a crushing setback to the Lancashire club, the former Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday manager being recognised as an integral cause of Wigan's success. Whelan, in particular, will be bitterly disappointed after publicly stating this season that he would not contemplate sacking Jewell even if the club went down. It is not known whether Whelan is aware of Jewell's unsettled state of mind. The 2-1 victory at Sheffield United yesterday ensured another chapter in the Wigan success story but Jewell knows that there are limitations to where a club of their resources can go next and that, realistically, they face another battle against relegation next season. The idea of a break appeals to him but his potential availability would also have a significant impact on this summer's managerial merry-go-round. Stuart Pearce, the Manchester City manager, is likely to be sacked after finishing another difficult season only four points above the relegation zone. City, who lost 2-1 at Tottenham Hotspur yesterday, have been closely monitoring Sam Allardyce's movements but the former Bolton manager will take over at Newcastle United this week and if, as expected, Pearce is dismissed Jewell will automatically be among the list of potential candidates to replace him. Wigan will hope that it is not too late to persuade him to abandon any thoughts of leaving, but Jewell is strong-minded and is thought to have more reasons for wanting to leave than stay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
