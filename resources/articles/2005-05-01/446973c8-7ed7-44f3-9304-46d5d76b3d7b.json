Wholesale gas prices for the coming winter were already 25% higher than they had been in February and 40% above last December's levels, according to the chief executive, Sir Roy Gardner. \"If wholesale prices stay at these levels, trading conditions will be more difficult in 2005 and 2006, and a retail price increase will be necessary to maintain gross margin. \"Given the continued volatility, no retail pricing decision has yet been taken,\" he said in a statement to the group's annual meeting. Last year British Gas raised prices by 5.9% in January and up to 12.4% in September and lost more than 1m customer accounts over the year, cutting the total to 17.7m. The number of accounts does not exactly match the number of customers because some take both gas and electricity and are counted separately. BG revealed yesterday that it had lost a further 382,000 accounts in the last four months, though its \"churn\" rate - that is, customers moving to other suppliers - was better than it had been before the price increase last September. Alan Tattersall, the head of home services at uSwitch.com, a switching and comparison service, said: \"The migration of customers is likely to continue unless BG radically rethinks its pricing policy - they are one of the UK's most expensive gas suppliers and consumers have quite rightly voted with their feet and switched suppliers.\" However, Sir Roy warned that BG might not be alone in raising prices. \"We will continue to take all the steps we can to mitigate the impact on our customers but retail price rises across the whole industry cannot be ruled out,\" he said. During the annual meeting, one shareholder said the company had been undiplomatic when raising prices and had failed to reassure customers that prices would come down when conditions improved. The chairman, Roger Carr, said BG was concerned by the loss of customers but said it was a \"natural consequence\" of being the market leader. The erosion of the customer base is causing some concern in the City, despite higher profits and dividends. In February Centrica reported a 16% increase in profits, a 59% rise in the dividend and a \u00a3500m share-buyback programme. Analysts at ING said: \"Strong cash generation, substantial dividend growth and a continuing share-buyback programme cannot be ignored, but we feel fears regarding the UK energy supply division of BG residential are likely to remain in investors' minds for the next few months.\" However, Angelos Anastasiou at Williams de Broe said that while the customer churn figure was \"disappointing\" there were signs of recovery. At the meeting Mr Carr declined to be drawn on reports that Centrica had taken part in merger talks with the Norwegian company Norsk Hydro."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
