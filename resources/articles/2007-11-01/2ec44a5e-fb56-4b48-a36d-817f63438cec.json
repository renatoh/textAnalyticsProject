The darkest visions of Andrea Dunbar, a single mother whose play Rita, Sue and Bob Too was made famous by the Royal Court theatre in 1982, engulfed her family and ended in the death of two-year-old Harris Dunbar last July. The child's mother, Samaya Rafiq, daughter of Dunbar, who died in 1990 after collapsing in a Bradford pub aged 29, was jailed for three years yesterday after admitting manslaughter. Bradford crown court heard she had allowed the boy to play with bottles of methadone until he developed a craving for the drug, and the heroin and crack cocaine which she took in front of him. The court heard that the relentlessly pessimistic vision of Samaya's mother, who recorded drug-taking, crime and casual sex on the Buttershaw estate, became reality for her daughter. Known as Lorraine Dunbar until she converted to Islam, Rafiq turned to drugs and prostitution after her mother's death led to her being taken into care. Her barrister, Mukhtar Hussain QC, said in mitigation before sentencing: \"She began taking drugs when she herself was a child. Her mother had left her money but when that ran out she turned to prostitution and crime to fund her habit.\" Like Andrea Dunbar, who spent 18 months in a refuge for battered women and had her three children by different fathers, Rafiq ended up in a hostel, where the drug abuse of her son became routine. Andrew Robertson QC, prosecuting, said: \"When a friend challenged her about letting Harris play with the bottles, she responded with words to the effect that there was no harm in it. Hair tests confirmed that in the last four months of his life, Harris had actually ingested methadone in not insignificant amounts. \"One witness described him screaming and holding his arms out as his mother took her dose as if he wanted some.\" The toddler was found apparently lifeless on a bed at the hostel and was pronounced dead at Bradford royal infirmary. A postmortem found the equivalent of 358mg of methadone a litre in the boy's tissues, with additional traces of heroin and crack cocaine in his hair. His DNA was found on three of Samaya's six methadone bottles and he had also drunk from a bottle of anti-depressant. The pathetic circumstances had many echoes of Andrea Dunbar's work, which was catapulted to fame after she met the Royal Court's director, Max Stafford-Clark, at the home of her social worker in the Bront\u00eb tourist village of Haworth, near Bradford. Her graphic portrayal of what was newly known at the time as the \"underclass\", a short play called The Arbour, was a cause celebre at the Court. Even greater success came with Rita, Sue and Bob Too, which became a successful film. As well as giving a clear-eyed vision of the dismal life of many people on Buttershaw, she caught a mood by consigning the cheery, pipe-sucking world of flat-capped northerners to the dustbin. Dunbar was equally celebrated for not having her head turned and refusing to leave Buttershaw, but her lifestyle led to serious ill-health and eventually a fatal brain haemorrhage. She made no bones about believing that most of her neighbours were forced to put their own interests first in the struggle to get by. Passing sentence, the recorder, Judge Stephen Gullick, told Rafiq: \"Your doubtless overwhelming desire to satisfy your own needs meant you totally failed to carry out your duty as a parent to protect your son from harm.\" Richard Bates, head of children's services for Bradford council, said: \"An independent review undertaken by the local safeguarding children board will be identifying any lessons that can be learned from this tragic case.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
