All of Chelsea's losses will be cleared at a stroke if, just this once, they can at last beat Arsenal. The long-suffering Claudio Ranieri would no longer be asked to account for FA Cup failure against Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side in each of the four seasons since he became manager at Stamford Bridge. The fans, in triumph, would instantly be blessed with total amnesia on the topic of the 16 consecutive matches in all competitions that have gone by without a win over Arsenal since 1998. So rare is a collision of English clubs in Europe that the tie will be fascinating for the mental nuances as much as the subtle touches of the footballers. When a team develop a habit of overpowering a rival there comes a moment when, with psychological jujitsu, their strength can be used against them. Deny it as they will, every Arsenal player is bound to recognise the irony and ignominy ahead if they should happen to falter precisely when victory carries with it a bigger prize than ever. Disappointment against Chelsea is far from inconceivable. Proliferating ambitions can be destructive and the Highbury club are alert to the risk of exhausting themselves by fighting so fiercely for the FA Cup and the Premiership as well as the Champions League. The weeks to come will drain them. After beginning the quarter-final, they take on Manchester United twice in succession in the league and FA Cup, with players sacrificed between those dates to international games that include an England friendly in Sweden. The Arsenal manager does not anticipate sympathetic treatment. \"I cannot see Sven-Goran Eriksson not selecting Arsenal players and Man United players and Chelsea players because then he would be in a situation where he has no players,\" Wenger noted. \"It's certainly the most difficult [period] I have faced since I have been here.\" Arsenal have to tolerate the England fixture, conclude their business with Ranieri's team and somehow pace themselves for Premiership fixtures in April against Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds and Spurs. With those firm obligations before them, Wenger cannot spare the energy for conjecture about a possible Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid. Even when life was conducted at a more sedate tempo, he never took the domination of Chelsea for granted. \"It was always hard games,\" he said, \"and they always performed very well. Maybe we had a psychological advantage because we have beaten them [before].\" Only a clownish mistake by Carlo Cudicini - who was yesterday ruled out of both matches by his broken finger - deprived Chelsea of a draw in this season's Premiership fixture at Highbury, and Eidur Gudjohnsen gave them a first-minute lead in the match at Stamford Bridge. They were ahead, too, at the interval in the FA Cup tie despite a linesman's mistake that chalked off a valid goal from Jesper Gronkjaer. Wenger, concerned about injuries that might beset a \"compact\" squad, is steeling himself for a \"Premiership-style\" struggle with Chelsea and is a little rueful that the draw \"takes a bit of charm off a European Cup tie\" by removing the element of foreign travel. The scope for amusement is limited, although the manager did suggest that Dennis Bergkamp could use a boat for his journey to Stamford Bridge if the Dutchman, with his fear of flying, cannot tolerate a Champions League away match without unusual travel arrangements. Though Arsenal are experiencing more varied pressures, it will still be impossible for Chelsea to play as if they have nothing to lose. In particular, they could lose a manager. Tiresome as the speculation over Ranieri is, Roman Abramovich must need confirmation that his money is being put to good use, and dejection spread over all five meetings with Arsenal this season would be a dreadful return on his investment. There has been a dullness about Chelsea that sits ill with the prices paid for footballers of high reputation. If an advantage is to be gained in the home leg with Arsenal, flair is a practical necessity. Chelsea need, as best they can, to echo the panache of Thierry Henry and there will be relief if all doubts are assuaged about the form and fitness of Ranieri's best buy of the season, Damien Duff. Otherwise the team may be prosaic and, when weighed down by expectations, they have lost at home to Besiktas and hobbled through goalless draws with Sparta Prague and, last week, Stuttgart. The away form has been stronger and, with their five clean sheets in a row in the Champions League, Ranieri's team may be equipped to cramp the Arsenal style. There was nothing slick about Wenger's side at the start of this tournament when they were floundering in away matches in Kiev and Moscow. It is Chelsea's mission to remind Arsenal of weaknesses which cannot have vanished entirely. The frenzy of interest in these matches will also take its toll. English clubs have not met in the European Cup for 26 years. The unexpected success of Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest over Liverpool absorbed the nation then, but 1978 could pass for an age of innocence by comparison with the cash-crazed, celebrity-choked era in which Chelsea and Arsenal meet. Arsenal's hold over Chelsea this season Arsenal 2 Chelsea 1 October 18 2003 Premiership: Chelsea's first defeat of the season was largly down to Carlo Cudicini's horrendous fumble which allowed Thierry Henry to seal a victory Arsenal just deserved. Claudio Ranieri was forced to pair Mario Melchiot and Robert Huth in the centre of the back four, but it was Arsenal rather than Chelsea who bought a victory with the riches of their squad system. Nwankwo Kanu and Dennis Bergkamp, as substitutes, dismantled Ranieri's defence in the final half-hour. Meanwhile Ranieri, by playing Damien Duff behind the front two, confirmed his position as the Premiership's most interventionist tactician. Arsenal 2 Chelsea 1 February 15 2004 FA Cup: This was the afternoon when Jose Antonio Reyes announced his arrival. Chelsea had been superior in the first half, managing not only to stifle Arsenal but create openings. How significant it looked later that Jesper Gronkjaer had a header incorrectly ruled out for offside before Adrian Mutu gave them the lead. The belief seemed to drain from Ranieri's players once Reyes, who had been a peripheral figure, equalised with a brilliant shot in the 56th minute. Five minutes later the young Spaniard got a second to complete a dramatic turnaround and Chelsea never looked like finding a way back. Chelsea 1 Arsenal 2 February 21 2004 Premiership: The Gunners turn ugly and hit new heights. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side swapped a swashbuckling approach for a new professionalism to sweep aside Chelsea once more. Again falling behind before hitting the front, Arsenal shut up shop for the second half in a resolute defensive display which drained the hope from Chelsea's attackers. Despite a display full of passion, the Blues failed to break down the Arsenal back four, Jens Lehmann proving his worth with a succession of late high catches. A resurgent Dennis Bergkamp was Arsenal's creative key."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
