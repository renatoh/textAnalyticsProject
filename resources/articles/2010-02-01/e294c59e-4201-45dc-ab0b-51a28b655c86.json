Its UK tour provides that opportunity, but Solon has yet fully to capitalise. A superfluous preface has been added and the story's dramatic deficiencies, easy to overlook on first viewing, stand exposed. And yet, at the evening's heart, Solon's prodigious character-comedy talent is intact in this dotty publishing industry picaresque. Solon admits that the first act has been added to fulfil venues' interval requirements. It shows. Her opening salvos are tentative; what follows \u2013 an introduction to her dramatis personae \u2013 is jolly but unnecessary. Far better when those characters take centre stage: Didier Auberge, a self-infatuated Frenchman whose masterpiece dispensed with words altogether; Sir Michael Black, a former home secretary who vowed to be \"tough on the meaning of crime\", and Carol Price, whose children's book about musical mice is given an embittered sequel after her divorce. Solon's ear for character is impressive. Familiar types \u2013 the patrician proprietor, the saucy secretary \u2013 are reborn in eccentric shapes and sizes. There are zinging one-liners, most often from one-woman demean machine Marcie Blitzer, a literary agent whose conversation leaves bruises. And, if she's uneasy behind a microphone, Solon is in command when let loose on her characters. It's a shame that the story remains just a peg on which to hang these rather than a mystery in its own right. Despite its flaws, the show shimmers with idiosyncratic personality, and honours the first rule of book-trade comedies: publish, and be damned funny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
