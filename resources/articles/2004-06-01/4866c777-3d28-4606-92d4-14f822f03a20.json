I am considering whether I should use this money to invest in a 50 per cent share of a house with my son. I do not need the money to live on while I am working, and envisage living on my pensions and savings when I retire. My son is 28, still living at home and paying \u00a350 a week towards his board. He has a good job with a reputable and fast-growing company as a software engineer and earns \u00a320,000. He does not have a partner, but would like to move out and buy his own house in Nottingham. Although he should have no problems getting a mortgage, prices are such that he cannot afford to buy on his own. The cheapest house in Nottingham is about \u00a380,000 and he has no savings to put down as a deposit. He is not a debt-ridden person and wouldn't want to borrow more than he felt he could afford to pay back. My idea is that he would repay the money as and when he could and, if the house were sold, I would get the money back. The drawbacks could be if either of us wanted to release our capital from the house; if my son was unable to pay his mortgage; that I would get no income from the property unless he took in a lodger; and any profit I made would be subject to capital gains tax when the house was sold. The advantages could be that it would enable my son to get on to the property ladder and, assuming that I didn't need the capital, my inheritance would maintain its value. I work full time as a lecturer in a further education college and earn \u00a328,000. I have some savings, about \u00a310,000, in cash Isas and 16 years' investment in the Teacher's Pension Fund. I live in a four-bedroom detached house in Nottingham with no mortgage and wish to continue living there. I let out one room in the house for \u00a3184 a month. I intend to carry on working for the next four years and then retire. On retirement I will get a lump sum of \u00a320,000 and a pension of \u00a36,000 a year because I have worked only for about 20 years. I will also be entitled to a full state pension of \u00a382 a week. I might look for part-time work, perhaps as an IT consultant, because that's my line. Recently I have been so busy that I haven't able to devote any time to it. Don't give up all of your inheritance Putting your inheritance into your son's house leaves you no options. David Hollingworth, of London &amp; Country Mortgages, warns: 'Unless her son's salary rises so he can afford to buy Pauline out, the money will be tied up in the property and retrievable only by selling, which is unlikely to be desirable.' James Dalby, head of investment strategy at Bates, agrees: 'It could be a mistake to tie up her inheritance in another property as she may need it to generate an income in retirement. Although she expects pension income of around \u00a310,000 gross a year, and already gets \u00a32,000 rent, this may not be enough for a comfortable retirement.' Your pension income will be inflation-linked but many expenses, like council tax, go up by more than inflation, so you should have a good deal of capital in reserve to supplement your pension. Dalby points out: 'With a pension at retirement of \u00a310,000 and expenses of \u00a37,000, expenses are 70 per cent of gross income. If, in the following 20 years, pension grows at an inflationary rate of 2.5 per cent a year but outgoings grow by 5 per cent, expenses become 113 per cent of income.'. You could do nothing for your son and invest \u00a370,000 for yourself or you could share the money, perhaps giving him just enough for a deposit. A gift will count towards your potential inheritance tax bill for the next seven years. If he still could not afford a mortgage, you could act as a guarantor, says Hollingworth: 'Once his income has increased to the point where he can support the loan himself, Pauline can be released from the mortgage and her responsibilities as guarantor.' Hollingworth believes a family offset mortgage might suit you better. They are sold by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Newcastle Building Society and Woolwich. Your son takes an offset mortgage in his name and you put your savings in your name in a separate account with the same bank or building society. You will not receive interest on your savings but he will only be charged interest on the dif ference between his mortgage and your savings. So, if he had a \u00a3140,000 mortgage, with your savings of \u00a370,000 he would pay interest on just \u00a370,000. You can withdraw money from your savings if necessary, although that would increase his interest payments. You cannot assume that his house will increase in value so it might not maintain the value of your inheritance. But if the price goes up you will face capital gains tax when you sell if you have taken a stake in the property. If you hold less than a 50 per cent share, you would need to ensure the Inland Revenue understands this, otherwise, on selling, it will charge you capital gains tax on half of any profit. The lender will insist your name goes on the mortgage deed, making you jointly liable for repayments. Could you afford to pay the whole mortgage if your son couldn't? The alternative is to lend him the money for a deposit, with a written agreement that he will pay you back, perhaps plus interest at a set rate or plus the amount the house has risen in value. Hollingworth advises: 'Pauline could then set up a deed of trust through her solicitor to protect her equity stake.' Whatever you do, you must draw up a document so you are both quite clear about the terms on which you have given or lent him the money. Dalby urges you to keep the \u00a310,000 in your cash Isas: 'The tax-free interest together with the security of capital are important.' He then suggests you give your son \u00a320,000 and keep \u00a350,000 to invest: 'She could put \u00a330,000 in safe cash-based investments such as Birmingham Midshires' three-year fixed rate account paying 5.45 per cent gross. The remaining \u00a320,000 could become a portfolio of equity income funds, such as unit trusts, which provide exposure to British shares with healthy dividend yields. While she does not need the income now, it can be reinvested until she does. With these funds you get the potential of income growth, because as companies increase their profits they also aim to increase dividend payments. Funds to consider include DWS UK Equity Income Plus, Framlington Monthly Income, Invesco Perpetual Income and Jupiter Income.' Pauline's to do list 1. Do not put all of your inheritance into property. 2. Give (or lend) your son enough for a deposit. 3. Consider a family offset mortgage. 4. Keep most of your savings on deposit. 5. Invest some for extra income later on. 6. Put any agreement with your son in writing. Let us help you Do you need some financial coaching? We help readers to solve their financial challenges.
