That is primarily because their opponents have been plotting their own victory a matter of metres away, with the two training grounds separated by little more than a hedge. \u201cTo be honest, although it\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw away, it\u2019s light years away as well,\u201d says Troy Deeney, the Watford captain, whose club are three years into a 10-year lease on their site while Arsenal own the land next door. \u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re building, year on year. The [recently opened] media facilities, the gym, it\u2019s getting better year after year. But when you build your own facilities you can have everything straight away. I suppose it shows where both clubs are at this moment in time. They\u2019re established and ready and we\u2019re the new up-and-coming team.\u201d Watford\u2019s momentum appears to have stalled. Seventh at Christmas, they are 13th having won only twice in the league since. Given that only three teams have conceded fewer than their 30 Premier League goals, the finger of blame is being pointed squarely at the attack. Discounting the own-goal Leeds\u2019 Scott Wootton scored in the fifth-round tie at Vicarage Road, the Hornets have found the net in only one of their past seven games. While relegation remains a distant and unlikely prospect, this has nevertheless prompted talk of a crisis of sorts and an unhealthy reliance on Odion Ighalo, who has scored 14 of their 29 league goals but none since January. \u201cIn an ideal world everyone would be scoring but it\u2019s just not the way it\u2019s working at the moment,\u201d Deeney says. \u201cBut if you stopped the season right now and Watford were on 37 points, in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, Ighalo\u2019s scored 14 league goals in his first season in the Premier League, does that sound like a bad season to anybody? Although people are trying to highlight certain things, we just have to remember we\u2019re in our first year in the Premier League, having our first proper run in the FA Cup for a long time and we\u2019re doing really well. It\u2019s just because we did so well at the start of the season, now it looks like we\u2019re in a bit of a rut. \u201cA lot of work early doors in the season was based on being solid as a team. We were getting a bit of stick when we weren\u2019t scoring goals and that seems to have come full circle because that\u2019s what people are talking about again now. But the main thing is we\u2019ve been competitive in every match. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been spanked in any game. That\u2019s probably the best thing for us.\u201d When Arsenal visited Vicarage Road in October they became one of very few teams to have made Watford appear tactically naive, battling through a fairly even opening hour before scoring three times in a chaotic 12 minutes to end the game as comfortable winners. \u201cThat\u2019s the only spell this season when we were too gung-ho I suppose,\u201d Deeney says. \u201cThey scored the first goal and, instead of hanging on to what we had for the next 10 minutes and steadying the ship, we went gung-ho and you can\u2019t do that against Arsenal. They just picked us apart and, before you knew it, the game\u2019s 3-0. So we know we have to be cautious, be very smart in our play and, if we do go a goal down, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d One advantage Watford have over Arsenal, who visit Barcelona for the second leg of their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Wednesday, is the ability to concentrate fully on this one game. Given the apparent inevitability of a mid-table finish in the league, many would prefer victory on Sunday to a win in any other fixture. \u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019re playing Villa at home next month and we could send them down,\u201d says Deeney, a committed, tattooed Birmingham City fan (his son, Myles, prefers Arsenal), of that idea. Watford\u2019s frustrations in front of goal have not affected Deeney\u2019s self-confidence, even if he has gone from scoring at least 20 times in each of his last three seasons to only four from open play \u2013 plus five penalties \u2013 this season. \u201cAnybody who knows me knows it\u2019s not about the personal gain this season,\u201d he says. \u201cWould I have liked to score 20 goals? Absolutely, of course I would. But I think Jamie Vardy scored only five goals last season, he\u2019s got confidence from that first year and he\u2019s learned and now he\u2019s the hottest property in English football. I don\u2019t want to compare myself to Vardy, because he\u2019s gone on to absolutely smash it this season and it puts a lot of pressure on me, but I do believe it\u2019s just a case of learning and doing what\u2019s right for the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
