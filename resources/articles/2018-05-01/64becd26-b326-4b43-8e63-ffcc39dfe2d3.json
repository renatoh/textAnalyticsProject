The Scot is not certain to be West Ham\u2019s manager next season despite securing their Premier League safety with two games to go, and both parties have doubts about whether he should continue. Moyes is due to hold talks over a new deal this month, having replaced Slaven Bilic on a six-month contract, and David Sullivan and David Gold, the owners, are aware many supporters believe the 55-year-old\u2019s approach is too negative. West Ham\u2019s efforts when they host Manchester United on Thursday night and Everton on Sunday will be a factor in the final judgment. A positive end would strengthen Moyes but he struck a bullish tone when asked about his plans. He has already risked angering Sullivan and Gold by complaining about West Ham\u2019s culture of leaks and pulled no punches before the visit of United, saying he wants to be at a club capable of challenging for European qualification. \u201cI\u2019ve been right for a few clubs and I think I\u2019d be right for many clubs,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cProbably apart from two or three managers there\u2019s nobody who\u2019s got a better win-ratio. \u201cI have to make sure I\u2019ve got what I want to do. For most of my seasons, apart from one last year, I\u2019ve been competing at the top six or eight. I need to see if West Ham are going to get there. I want to be a manager pushing the top six or eight. You need the tools for that. I want to make sure I can give the supporters what they crave.\u201d Moyes said he remained loyal when one of West Ham\u2019s relegation rivals, believed to be Stoke City, approached him and he does not expect to be short of offers if he leaves. \u201cI could have joined a Premier League club during the season here when I was West Ham manager,\u201d he said. \u201cI chose not to. But I\u2019ve got other things if it\u2019s not renewed. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Moyes, who said Joe Hart was not guaranteed to start against United after missing Saturday\u2019s 2-0 victory at Leicester City because of illness, believes West Ham need a better infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be done on the pitch and a lot to be done off the pitch as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are a lot of things we could address, like around the training ground. My experience has allowed me to see what good really looks like off the pitch, whether it be facilities, a board of directors, the people who work round football clubs, the roles people should have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
