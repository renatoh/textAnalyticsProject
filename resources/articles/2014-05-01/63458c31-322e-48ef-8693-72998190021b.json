You may recall that Boris, invited to endorse the group's effort to start a debate about air quality, declined. It's tricky territory for the mayor. He promised an atmosphere of ski-slope freshness. Instead, he faces claims that yuck, smog and harmful gases contribute to 4,300 deaths a year. Now he's apparently ducking a chance to discuss it with MPs. An invitation to appear before the Commons environmental audit committee would appear to have been batted away. The mayor plans to dispatch an underling and MPs cannot compel him to appear because select committees lack that power. That doesn't preclude a goodwill acceptance, of course. Maybe he's heading abroad to take the Alpine air. \u2022 As the woes of the economy and an ongoing political crisis dominate French headlines, the media also flags up another debate of high importance: \"Anorexic princesses?\" The star European royal expert and radio host St\u00e9phane Bern is on the case. The Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Letizia of Spain and Rania of Jordan are all case studies, he claims. \"Before her wedding, Kate's engagement ring had to be reduced by two ring sizes to fit her shrunken finger. Because the minute her image advisers had told her the TV cameras at the wedding would add 2kg, she had begun to pay special attention to her weight.\" Rania's no better, he claims. \"I once spent several days with her, so she couldn't lie to me about what she'd been eating.\" She couldn't wish for a more reliable confidant, you might think. But then, none seem to consume in the quantities that Bern regards as appropriate. They're fortunate he's there, and willing to help. \u2022 Can't be easy being married to a man virtually everyone would seek to indict as a war criminal, but Cherie Blair makes a good fist of it. Returning to the London School of Economics, she mapped out her journey from a deprived childhood in Liverpool. Getting to the LSE in 1972 was some achievement, as was securing decent accommodation \u2013 initially, she was housed in a converted convent. But one might conclude that from those early years she developed stoicism, for the daily walk to the LSE would take her past the Royalty Theatre in Kingsway, which was at the time home to the bawdy Oh Calcutta! Most prominent was a poster of its star, Tony Booth, her father, naked as the day he was born. \u2022 John Humphrys muses in Waitrose magazine about the ordeal of sitting in that black chair for interrogation during Mastermind. He asks the questions, and wild horses wouldn't drag him into the contestant's seat. Not least because, with all the pressure, the mind goes blank. \"My favourite was when I asked this nice, easy opening question in the general knowledge round: 'What breakfast cereal do you associate with prison?' While the poor chap's eyes glazed over and panic took hold \u2013 and every viewer in the land shouted 'porridge!' at the screen \u2013 he proudly delivered his answer: 'Cheerios!'\" \u2022 Staying with the BBC early evening, the recent death of Richard Kershaw robs British television of one of its more glamorous on-screen reporters. Dubbed \"our Tony Curtis lookalike\" by colleagues less aesthetically blessed, his fame accelerated when asked to present the popular One Show forerunner Nationwide in 1980. But it was not a natural fit, with Kershaw often infuriating backroom staff by turning interesting items into dull ones. Mindful of his towering attribute, he is best remembered by old hands on the programme for his reply to a young secretary who asked how he kept good looks despite advancing years? \"Sex and lots of it,\" he replied. \u2022 Finally, ever reflectful, the Daily Mail's Stephen Glover takes to worrying about \"the utter uniformity of views, the relentless attacks and the lack of fair-mindedness\". Self flagellation? Epiphany? Alas not. He's writing in Standpoint magazine about the scuffing of Nigel Farage by the Times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
