And if they're not \"now\", can we hook their relevance on an anniversary, to make them so? Thus we're offered exemplary docs on Iraq, 10 years on, or eco-friendly homes, on oil in Ireland, or the special mela that takes place in India every 12 years. All great, in their newsy, informative way. If aliens were to come to Earth and listen to nothing but Radio 4 for a week, they'd definitely gather relevant facts and opinion about the world we live in today. Though I wonder, sometimes, how entertained they would be. But documentaries can be something else: a glimpse into another world, a brief spotlight on a life. Not the glare of a reality show, but the splash of light from the sun on a cloudy day, there for a minute, then gone. On Wednesday, in Lives in a Landscape, we met Terry and Robert. Terry is a photographer. Well, he was: he took pictures of the royal family and the Rolling Stones for newspapers until he had a stroke a couple of years ago. Robert is his carer. Terry found him by putting an advert in a corner shop in Crouch End, north London, where he lives. It read: \"Pusher required.\" Someone pointed out that he might attract the wrong type of person, so he added \"\u2026 for silly old fart in a wheelchair\". Robert is the man who can. Alan Dein followed Terry and Robert as they went about their everyday routine. And it was every day. Every day Robert manoeuvres Terry into his squeaky wheelchair. Every day they go down in the lift from his flat, and every day they wheel to a wine bar. There Terry has a \"pinkypoo\" \u2013 a ros\u00e9 wine \u2013 to be followed by lunch, and later, some mysterious \"fun\". Terry wouldn't say what such fun entailed, though we could guess, and we were right. The programme was like an Alan Bennett play. You could imagine it rewritten as one, anyway, with Terry and Robert's touching, repetitive relationship changing due to circumstance: an uninvited extra person, perhaps, or an unexpected event such as Robert becoming ill. There were so many great lines, mostly from Terry, who used the term \"thus-wise\" twice. \"The health service have a certain way. They want it done proper-style. I want it done jazzy-style.\" \"You go ahead and have a coffee, dear boy. Don't order on my tab.\" \"Life is ongoing and continuous and everywhere.\" You just don't hear voices like Terry's these days: educated, frivolous, saucy, stoic. The voice of an ageing rou\u00e9. There used to be loads of men like that, bashing about Fleet Street, lounging in the Coach and Horses, squiring women to the races and then forgetting who they came with and taking home another leggy filly. I suppose they all died. There are more Roberts around \u2013 working-class, kind, regular \u2013 but they too don't often make it to a Radio 4 documentary. Not unless something terrible has happened. What a lovely programme. It quite made my week. Jeremy Hardy doesn't make a lovely programme. Oh no. He makes a comedy show that is so rabidly leftwing that Caroline Raphael, Radio 4's comedy commissioning editor, has to go on Feedback and confess that she finds it hard to locate comics of a Tory persuasion. Don't worry, Caroline! That's because there are no funny Conservatives. Only PJ O'Rourke can do rightwing humour and he's an iconoclast. Anyway, cuddle your enemies and all that. Hardy knows who and what he's up against, and so do we. He sticks to his shtick, but gently pushes sideways: on Wednesday's programme he moved from whether it's right to compliment a woman on her haircut to checking out other blokes' trainers to going to the gym, where, he observed, there is always a man in his 70s, naked, talc-ing his privates. Not very political with a capital P. Funny, though, and that's what matters. And now, to pope-watch. There's been a lot of it going on recently, because there's not much else going on. It did seem OTT to devote the whole of The World Tonight to matters papal, though: I'm married to a Catholic and he wasn't that bothered. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Radio 4 top bods still feel guilty about sacking high church Ed Stourton from Today (as they should), and also worry about the station's representation of religion (minimal). And so whenever a Catholic matter comes up, they rush Ed to Rome and let him talk, as a way of saying sorry to all. He's a delight when he talks, of course, but still.
