A spokesman for the Academy Transformation Trust (ATT), where Ian Cleland earns \u00a3180,000 a year, declined to explain why its chief executive was absent despite recently claiming that it was \u201ccommitted to being open and transparent in all that we do\u201d. The trust\u2019s managing director, Joyce Hodgetts, was also on \u201ctemporary leave,\u201d a spokesman confirmed, but again declined to offer an explanation. Cleland was at the centre of a row during the summer, after he told staff across ATT\u2019s 20 academies that more than 30 staff roles were at risk due to \u201csignificant financial challenges\u201d. Weeks later a joint C4 Dispatches and Observer investigation revealed that the taxpayer was paying Cleland to lease and have joint insurance with his wife on an XJ Premium Luxury V6 Jaguar car. Included in nearly \u00a33,000 worth of receipts was payment for servicing the car and the purchase of new tyres. Cleland had also spent \u00a33,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money on first-class rail travel, while dining expenses racked up on his taxpayer-funded credit card include a meal with other staff at a Marco Pierre White restaurant totalling \u00a3471 and at the Bank restaurant in Birmingham, at a cost of \u00a3703.45. At the time the trust\u2019s director of finance, Mike Giddings, said that Cleland\u2019s role \u201crequires significant, regular travel throughout the regions where our academies are based, hence the maintenance costs, including tyres and vehicle health checks\u201d. He said \u201call expense claims are carefully considered to ensure that they are directly related to the operational costs of the business\u201d. Last month, a secondary-school principal at one of the trust\u2019s academies was sacked following an investigation into breaches of safeguarding rules. In a letter to parents, the school\u2019s sponsors said the decision had been taken because of what it called \u201cserious breaches\u201d in applying safeguarding procedures. However, a spokesman for ATT said that the incident was not linked to the current \u201csituation\u201d, adding: \u201cAcademy Transformation Trust\u2019s chief executive officer, Ian Cleland, and managing director, Joyce Hodgetts, are currently on temporary leave. The trust\u2019s executive team \u2013 Claire Pritchard, director of resources, Lisa Crausby, principal improvement director, and Mike Giddings, director of finance \u2013 continue to lead the organisation, reporting into the board.\u201d Cleland announced in March that ATT was seeking to save \u00a3500,000 from its schools in the Midlands and east of England and had asked staff to reapply for their jobs. \u201cThe education sector is facing a number of significant financial challenges across the country with all schools, academies and multi-academy trusts being affected,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAs a result, it is essential that we review our costs and consider where savings can be made, without impacting on the quality of education.\u201d Despite the financial strains on the education system, evidence has emerged in recent weeks of high salaries being taken by executives and principals across the country. It emerged last week that the head of a south London primary school federation earned \u00a3370,000 last year. Sir Craig Tunstall, head of the Gipsy Hill Federation, was paid \u00a3330,000 plus \u00a344,000 in pension contributions by Lambeth council in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
