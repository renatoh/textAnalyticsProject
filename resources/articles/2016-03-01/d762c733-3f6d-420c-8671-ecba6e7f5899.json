After edging ahead of Stoke City and Liverpool in pursuit of the top-six finish that should bring European qualification, Southampton\u2019s captain for the day glancedahead to Sunday\u2019s clash and beyond. No one is afraid to dream of competing for future titles with Leicester leading from the front this season. \u201cI think it gives other teams inspiration,\u201d the Ireland schemer said. \u201cWhat they have done is incredible this year, to show that kind of consistency. Everybody [was] waiting for them to slip up but they seem to have got that drive and determination. They fully deserve to be where they are, fair play to them. Maybe it gives everybody else that incentive that they can achieve something like that.\u201d Graziano Pell\u00e8\u2019s first goals in 14 games extended Southampton\u2019s decent away form \u2013 10 points from five games \u2013 as they fended off the Stoke comeback threatened by Marko Arnautovic\u2019s fine finish early in the second half and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s late dismissal for a clumsy challenge on Erik Pieters. Southampton should win their appeal against the red card as the substitute bumped rather than elbowed his opponent. \u201cWe looked at the two games before today \u2013 this game and the Liverpool game \u2013 before the international break as being very important in terms of our ambitions for the season,\u201d Davis added. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the first step in the right direction. \u201cOf course it will be a good game. They\u2019re in form. I watched them against Man United in the Europa League the other night and they played some excellent stuff. We know we\u2019ll have to be at our best to get something from the game but being at home we\u2019re confident we can show our quality and get the right result. The league as a whole has got closer.\u201d Liverpool may be sapped by Thursday\u2019s second leg at Old Trafford while Southampton, with no midweek action, will be boosted by their captain Jos\u00e9 Fonte\u2019s return from a one-game suspension. The ending of Pell\u00e8\u2019s long barren run is also a timely boost as the Italian emerged from his goalscoring hibernation, as in the middle of last season, with an excellent all-round display. With Charlie Austin hamstrung, Pell\u00e8 appears back to his best now he has fully recovered from a knee injury and has promised to learn from undermining his own cause after he played through the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s not to find an excuse, I\u2019m always a really honest guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to play with my health. I can\u2019t say: \u2018No, today I\u2019m not able to play.\u2019 At the end, with the help of the medical staff, I came back fit. It has to be a lesson for next year but now my best result is to be fit again and the goals will come. \u201cNow it seems like I\u2019m back. But that\u2019s the life of a striker. Again for me it\u2019s important to win, because when we score and we win it\u2019s always amazing to go and look forward.\u201d Man of the match Graziano Pell\u00e8 (Southampton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
