Van Gaal\u2019s team made such a struggle of beating Sheffield United, ninth in League One, in the FA Cup on Saturday there were ironic cheers after a shot at goal and Paul Scholes, in his role as a television pundit, said the manager looked bored on the touchline, along with just about everyone else watching the match. The same complaint has followed United throughout much of Van Gaal\u2019s reign but this is the first time he has confessed to finding their performances monotonous and, though he continued to defend his team against the \u201cvery negative\u201d media, he said he understood the supporters\u2019 dark humour. \u201cThere are matches that I have enjoyed very much. Against Chelsea I enjoyed it but the result was 0-0 and we could have lost. There are also matches where I\u2019m very bored or angry because we are not disorganising our opponent\u2019s defence but that is football. It\u2019s not every match that every club is playing fantastically, football that attracts the people. \u201cThey have been ironic [against Sheffield United] but that\u2019s an expression of the fans and that\u2019s good. The players were frustrated and the fans were frustrated. But the fans also have to know we can\u2019t always play fantastic football and that was also the case in former days when it didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m sorry about that, but it is like that.\u201d United are fifth in the Premier League, nine points behind the leaders, Arsenal, and endured an eight-match winless run before beating Swansea City in their last league fixture. The manager\u2019s job has come under scrutiny and it was put to him that his assistant Ryan Giggs came from the same background as Scholes and Gary Neville, another regular critic, and must want more adventurous football. \u201cI want that also,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cWe have to be able to do that. But that\u2019s why an opponent is there and they want to prevent us from doing that.\u201d Van Gaal, who will be missing the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger for the trip to St James\u2019 Park, described Newcastle as \u201cplaying very well\u201d despite their position in the Premier League\u2019s relegation places."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
