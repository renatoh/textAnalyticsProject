By far the greatest number of cases has been recorded in the US, which has reported 782,159. Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the UK have also recorded more than 100,000 cases each. The figures are likely to underestimate the true scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes. Oil prices fall to historic lows The US oil market has collapsed into negative prices for the first time in history as North America\u2019s oil producers ran out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic. The price of US crude oil fell by more than 105% as rising stockpiles threatened to overwhelm oil storage facilities. This is the lowest level since futures contracts began trading in 1983. UK hospital deaths total rises by 449 The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care said 16,509 people had died in UK hospitals since the outbreak began, an increase of 449 on the day before. A total of 386,044 people have been tested, of whom 124,743 have tested positive. WHO chief says \u2018nothing hidden from US\u2019 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said the body wants \u201call countries to get the same message immediately because that helps countries to prepare well and to prepare quickly\u201d, after criticism from the US president Donald Trump over the timeliness of its warnings about the pandemic. US anti-lockdown rallies \u2018could cause Covid-19 surge\u2019 As healthcare workers in the states of Colorado and Pennsylvania stage counter-protests against rightwing anti-quarantine rallies that continue to spread across the US, some experts have warned such rallies could cause a surge in cases. Several nurses gathered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Monday, where a protest against stay-at-home orders was taking place. The nurses carried signs urging people to go home. Spain\u2019s death rate continues to fall The country reported 399 deaths in 24 hours, lower than Sunday\u2019s figure of 410. A total of 20,852 people have died in Spain, with over 200,000 infected and more than 80,000 cured. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is expected to ask parliament to extend the national lockdown until 11 May. Italy sees fall in infections For the first time since the outbreak began, Italy announced a fall in the number of people currently infected \u2013 down 20 to 108,237. It said 454 more people had died, 21 more than the previous day, bringing the death toll to 24,114. \u201cThis is positive data as it shows the number of people who are currently positive with the virus is declining,\u201d Angelo Borrelli, the chief of Italy\u2019s civil protection authority, told reporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
