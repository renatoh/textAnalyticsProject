After one hour of trading, the shares were at 618p in Paris, below the 632p issue price for institutions but above the 601p offered to retail buyers. Although analysts cautioned against reading too much into the early stages of the flotation, the fact that Orange was launched at the bottom end of an already lowered price range will cause concern among its competitors. UK telecoms giant BT, German rival Deutsche Telekom and KPN of Holland are all planning to float their mobile phone operations and will balk at the reception given to Europe's second largest wireless company. BT is struggling to reduce a \u00a330bn debt burden and the planned flotation of its wireless division is beset with problems. These include the future of its stakes in French rival Cegetel and Spanish mobile phone company Airtel. \"It will be hard to get BT and KPN onto the market,\" said Mark James, telecoms analyst at Nomura. \"I am not even sure what is in BT's wireless subsdiary at the moment and I don't even know if their stakes in Airtel or Cegetel will be in there. BT Wireless gets smaller every time we look at it.\" Telecoms companies are rushing their subsidiaries to market in a bid to pay back the massive loans they have taken out to pay for European third generation mobile phone licences. More than \u00a350bn was spent on licences in the UK and Germany alone last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
