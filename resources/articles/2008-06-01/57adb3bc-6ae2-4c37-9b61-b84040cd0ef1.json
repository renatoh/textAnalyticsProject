I only watch certain sports, and I only watch them live - I don't think I've ever been able to watch a replay of a match or game of which the result was already decided. I feel bound to cheat and look up what can be looked up. I watch for aesthetic reasons. Some are to do with real dramatic tension. There is a story, and the end is really unknown until it comes. I have worked out that I also watch as though I was watching a kinetic sculpture or abstract light show. The things I watch are all contained in quadrilaterals, concern the movement of round balls, and the shifting lines of force and energy made by the players' movements. The games I care about are snooker, tennis, and football. The rules of rugby have changed to make the movements more fluid and exciting for the TV viewer so sometimes I watch that too. But I cannot get interested in, say, motor racing or golf. I wondered whether Euro 2008 would be exciting or gripping with no national team to support. It has, in fact, been infinitely more pleasurable, more varied, and more interesting. This has caused me to think about the emotions that go into 'supporting' a team. I myself tend instinctively to substitute northern European teams if there is no English interest. But when you look closely at 'supporting' it is a weird emotion and bears only a tangential relation to admiration of skills and courage in players. Chambers Dictionary defines 'support' as 'to bear the weight of, to hold up, to endure' - all of which, especially enduring, we had to do again and again before the English got eliminated from the competition. The dictionary also refers to 'maintaining a loyal interest in the fortunes of (especially a sporting team) usually by attendance at matches'. I have only once been this kind of supporter - only ever attended one match - when The Observer sent me to the England-Germany semi-final of Euro 1996 at Wembley, and I found myself seated among packs of Germans wearing horned helmets and tabards. It was a pleasant experience. They stood up and roared when their team did well, and then patted me comfortably on the shoulder to show they sympathised with me too. None of us enjoyed the tension of the penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won. But 'supporting' a team alone in an armchair is often a tense and dismal business. The emotions are horribly one-way. I don't quite know what they are about. I have tennis players I love to watch - Ferreiro, Kiefer and Safin - but although I admired Henman's elegance I don't think I have ever watched one of his matches through. I found things to do at my desk or in the kitchen, and peered in, anxiously, from time to time to see if he was still there. Murray doesn't bother me the same way. He is obstreperously Scottish and is his own problem. But then, so was Henman his own problem, not mine. There is something ugly in having a problem you can do nothing about. I talk to my dentist about football. I said to him before the English team's final Croatia disaster that I didn't think they would qualify. 'The English what?' he said furiously and filled my mouth with shining and stabbing things so I couldn't answer. But he was right. Compared to all the teams left in Euro 2008, the English lacked both cohesion and elegance. One would never have chosen to 'support' them if one had a choice. But one didn't, and yet felt implicated in their muddles and disasters. I knew in my guts, in that last match against Croatia, that they would not have the purpose and determination to stop Croatia scoring again. I hoped they would, and knew they wouldn't, and they didn't. No such emotions mar watching the England-less Euro 2008. I felt a kind of primitive relief when the English supporters in the stadium began to boo. I have never seen furious-faced supporters, as opposed to disappointed ones. It was ugly but cathartic. The English press, and the English team, and the English supporters always collude to tell an improbable story about what is going to happen before a competition begins. We are told we have a constellation of major players who will sweep everyone aside. We don't. We have several very good players who can't play together - they were better under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and got about as far in the last World Cup as we could, realistically, have hoped. The sad moment of truth was when Gerrard said: 'We talked ourselves up too much.' Watching Euro 2008 has been pure pleasure, unaccompanied by any gut anxieties. It began with the Dutch going forward so joyfully and making such lovely shapes, and went on with the fierce courage of the Turks, coming back twice from the very brink of defeat. The only comparable drama I have watched was when Liverpool came back from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005. I have a Turkish friend - poet, man of the theatre, professor - who is a fierce fan of Galatasaray so I take vicarious supporters' pleasure on his behalf. I remember once being kept awake all night by singing and dancing crowds all along the Bosphorus because Trebizond had beaten Aston Villa. Turkish fans and Turkish teams are ferocious in the same way. By the time the quarter-finals were over the teams I found disappointing had been eliminated - the sad, bewildered French, the wooden, blockish Italians - along with teams I had enjoyed watching - the long-legged, striding Swedes, for instance, and the Dutch, who were unexpectedly playing the kind of football they invented, a whole team moving together and understanding where everyone else was, and where they could, and would, go. When they played the Russians I would have been happy for either to win - either the quarter-final or the whole tournament. The Dutch were elegant and the Russians were startling and endlessly inventive. Both sides were better than I had expected from earlier appearances but the Russians had become a different team from the one that beat the English, 2-1, in a match the English had to win, last October. It is exciting to watch what has been a collection of clever, separate players, suddenly become an articulate whole. When the Germans played the Portuguese the armchair spectators in our house did take sides. My husband sits in the room half-watching and half-studying astronomy on his laptop - though he always manages to notice and get indignant about diving. I very much wanted the Germans to beat the Portuguese, largely because I still remember Cristiano Ronaldo's petulant display and nasty wink when Rooney was sent off in the quarter-final against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup. My husband was extraneously irritated by German politicians' heavy-handed comments, that day, after the Irish referendum, and cheered on the Portuguese. I was supporting the Turks against the Croatians simply because their failure to give up against the Czechs was the most exciting moment so far in the whole tournament. Unlike the English, they also refused to give up against the Croats. Semih's equalising goal when the Croats were already celebrating victory was one of the goals, and most dramatically satisfying moments, of the whole tournament. I surprised myself in the Turkish-German semi-final by becoming an ardent supporter for the first time and heard my own voice calling 'Come on, the Turks'. They came on, and were as brave and fierce and indefatigable as ever. The Germans were careful and intelligent but the Turks - despite so many of the players being different because of injuries and suspensions - were more than ever a team with one identity and one purpose. They so nearly managed again to take the match to extra time, which would have felt better. Lahm's last-minute goal did to them what they had done to the Czechs and the Croats. I am quite happy that Germany reached the final - they scored clever goals, and also do not give in or give up. As Ballack said, the Turks and the Germans have the same mentality. In the other semi-final, the Spanish surprised me. They had said that the Russians - unlike the Italians - played a kind of open football which would make it easier for them to play their best. They played beautifully and gracefully, making the Russians appear a little lost and confused where in earlier matches they had been full of surprises. The Spanish were smiling and we smiled with them. Watching football on TV instead of in a stadium means that the skills of the cameramen and film crews construct the story we see. They can show you how a move was put together - from many points of view - the bits you couldn't see, the lurking striker, the waiting defender. They show you also, in slow motion, the bits of drama that passed fleetly. The curve of a studded boot round a hooked ankle. The free-falling diving form, untouched by human arm or leg. One of the best flashbacks ever was when the cameras - presumably after sifting all their footage - suddenly found a wonderful image of Ballack's face when he scored his decisive free-kick against Austria, a distorted mask of focused breathing energy, like a classical sculpture of a wind god. Thinking about this has helped me to see that while penalties within a match are part of the drama - part of the text - the penalty shoot-out is peculiarly nasty because it changes the viewers' emotional relationship with teams and players. Yes, we get horribly tense, but tension is less pleasurable than excitement. And a series of two-man duels isn't really part of the game we have just seen and sensed. In the anti-climactic shoot-out at the end of the unsatisfactory Italy-Spain match, the more attractive team won, but it didn't feel like a good ending. One does not remember the winners. One remains haunted by the losers. I shall never forget Gareth Southgate's dejected hunched shoulders after he missed the crucial penalty in Euro 1996. Or watching Gerrard miss a penalty in the shoot-out with Portugal. One of the pleasures of this tournament has been watching quite different teams finding their best shape as they progressed. The Russians succeeded the Dutch and were succeeded by the Spanish. It has been an experience of watching the best teams become better and win the matches. The Germans have still got things that can get stronger whereas the Spanish seem to have played as well as they can. That ought to mean that the Germans will win. They are saving something. Byatts's best in threes Three players Germany's Schweinsteiger, Spain's Fernando Torres and Pavlyuchenko of Russia. All three players are indefatigable and have an extraordinary sense of the shape of a game. In the end Pavlyuchenko was more consistently exciting than Arshavin. Schweinsteiger is a mixture of power and clinical precision. I loved his flicked goal against the Turks. Torres turns a whole team into a work of art, and Pavlyuchenko has courage and intelligence. Three incidents \u00b7 Wesley Sneijder's wonderful fourth goal in Holland's 4-1 defeat of the French. This was the moment when I really believed that Holland were back to their former grace and glory. \u00b7 Ballack's free kick against Austria - to see him make up his mind, compose himself, and then concentrate all that exact power into one movement was truly splendid. \u00b7 The two Turkish comebacks and last-minute goals against both the Czech Republic and Croatia - these were the dramatically most satisfactory and uplifting moments of the whole tournament - indeed, the most exciting moments of football I have ever seen. Three managers \u00b7 Fatih Terim, the Turkish magician. I've never seen a manager so much part of his team. I loved his rapid, spell-casting movements with his fingers. He conveyed complete belief and willpower. \u00b7 Guus Hiddink, the Russian manager. I liked him for the opposite reasons - his unruffled calm, his philosophical approach to how good or bad his players were. And he speaks splendid witty sentences, especially when being dry about the Dutch. \u00b7 Luis Aragon\u00e9s, the Spanish manager. It is very good to see someone almost 70 years old overseeing passionate, lovely football. His face doesn't change much - he has a Spanish kind of dignity. ...and finally \u00b7 I know the Turks are not in the final but they were far and away the most exciting side - they had heart, they loved what they were doing, they went grimly on when they should have given up hope, and not only went on, but turned defeat into victory. \u00b7 The saddest team - and probably the worst - was the French, a collection of ghosts of once awe-inspiring and fluent players, who appeared lost and bewildered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
