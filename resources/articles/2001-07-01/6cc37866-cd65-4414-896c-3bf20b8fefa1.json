Fifa insiders have revealed that two high-ranking executive members - Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil and vice-president Julio Grondona of Argentina - are both directors of the South American television and marketing company. It is understood that Blatter was instrumental in awarding their company the contract for the World Club Championship and the Confederations Cup. Blatter will be quizzed during this week's Fifa congress in Buenos Aires about the appointment of Traffic, the $45 million they still owe Fifa and his sudden decision to cancel the World Club Championship, which was due to be held in Spain this summer. Traffic have so far returned only $21 million of the $66 million total that they were meant to repay to Fifa as part of their contract. Senior Fifa sources claim that Blatter's decision to call off the tournament came after Traffic began experiencing difficulties in raising funds from broadcasters and sponsors. Fifa executive committee member Abdullah Al-Dabal, chairman of the organising committee, is believed to be furious that Blatter intervened. He has told Fifa insiders that the decision to call off the event was taken by just three people: Blatter, Grondona and Teixeira. The decision to abandon the event just three months before it was scheduled to take place has been blamed on the collapse of sports marketing firm ISL, whose recent bankruptcy has left the 2002 World Cup Finals facing a massive financial deficit. But the Swiss-based firm never had any involvement in the funding of the World Club Championship. Some Fifa insiders believe ISL's difficulties were a convenient excuse to prevent the event in Spain becoming an embarrassment for Blatter. Blatter will, this week, be asked to provide a full explanation of his role, by executive members angered at the events of recent weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
