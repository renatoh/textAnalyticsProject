Matthew Hoggard bowled four no-balls in his seven-over opening spell, then dropped Jeff Cook off Richard Dawson at long-off, an expensive miss because the ECB-qualified Australian went on to launch Dawson for two sixes on to the roof of the indoor school and collected a couple more to reach 70 from 59 balls. But Michael Vaughan, who earlier had picked up where he left off for England with 63 not out from 50 balls, capped an athletic fielding performance by running out Cook with a direct hit from backward point. Cook had threatened to undo the damage of Chris Silverwood's early spell, with only 35 conceded from his 10 overs and the wickets of Mike Hussey and Russell Warren. But after Vaughan's swoop Hoggard claimed a catch, a run-out and his second wicket. Earlier Silverwood scored his second half-century of the summer from No3, a straight six off Tony Penberthy being the highlight of his 61, a one-day best. But it was Matthew Wood's 91 from 99 balls which laid the foundation for Yorkshire, continuing a curious season in which he has scored centuries in the other two one-day competitions but has yet to pass 50 in the championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
