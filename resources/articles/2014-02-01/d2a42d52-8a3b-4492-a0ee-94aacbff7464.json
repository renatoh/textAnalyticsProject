The couple, who failed to qualify on Tuesday for the final discipline of the pairs figure skating, which takes place on Wednesday, did well even to reach the Winter Olympics, having been starved of funding and forced to rely on the generosity of their parents to help them achieve their dreams. Tuesday's elimination \u2013 after the British pair finished outside the top 16 qualifiers for Wednesday's free programme \u2013 was especially hard to take, given that the road to Sochi has also been potholed with financial difficulties. King, 29, and Kemp, 25, finished 16th at the Vancouver Games in 2010, where they also became engaged, but since then their funding has run dry. Given that it costs the pair \u00a325,000 a year for coaching and facilities alone, with travel costs on top, it is little wonder that their life post-Sochi remains uncertain. \"We should be in good shape for South Korea [in 2018] but we don't want to let our parents pay for everything any more,\" says King. \"We want to go therebut whether we can afford it I don't know.\" UK Sport, the country's elite-funding agency, spent around \u00a314m helping winter athletes on their path towards Sochi, a figure dwarfed by the \u00a3315m spent on summer sports before London 2012. Figure skating, despite having been one of Britain's strongest disciplines at previous Winter Games, was awarded less than \u00a3175,000 in the four years up to Sochi, with King and Kemp receiving nothing from that allocation. The pair, who trained for five years in Poland before moving to a base in Ellenton, Florida, where they have been for three years , admit that without the financial support of their parents they would not have been in Russia. \"Since Vancouver we've had nothing,\" says King. \"We get a little bit from our federation, who pay [something] towards our flights for major events, but nothing other than that.\" \"Going into Vancouver we had brilliant funding. We were really determined to do the next Olympics in Sochi. We were getting everything well funded and when we finished Vancouver the money just stopped, every last bit of it. \"It was a shock to us. Everyone kept saying that because London got the summer Olympics, therefore the winter athletes were losing out. That's the only reason we ever heard. \"We asked our parents for advice and they said they could fund us for the next couple of years and treat it like a university fund \u2013 like we were learning our trade as ice skaters. Without them we would have had to stop straight after Vancouver.\" King and Kemp on Tuesday, have won eight British titles and secured their place at Sochi at a second qualifying event in September last year. However, were it not for the generosity of the rink owners in Ellenton, who have allowed them free time on the ice since they secured Olympic qualification, they would not have been representing Britain in the pairs. King, who is from Carlisle, insists the funding problems have not dampened his enthusiasm for the sport but says the paucity of money may well be damaging the long-term future of figure skating in the UK. \"I've seen so many talented young skaters retire because of money,\" he says. \"I think the facilities side of it in the UK is fine but then the funding is a bit more difficult. It's expensive \u2013 just the living costs, plus things that you wouldn't think about when you're earning a wage. It all adds up.\" \"Obviously some sports have more medal success and that's why UK Sport gives them funding, but figure skating has been the best medalled sport for Britain in the winter Olympics but we don't seem to get anything. \"That said, we don't complain. We're still living in Florida and with the best coaches in the world. We may not have a wage like most of the athletes we are competing against but we still try our best.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
