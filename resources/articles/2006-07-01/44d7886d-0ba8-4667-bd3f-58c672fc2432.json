Pedrosa, in only his first MotoGP season, will hope to slash the 42-point gap between himself and the championship leader, his team-mate Nicky Hayden, who will start from the fourth row of the grid. Reigning champion Valentino Rossi, who earlier appeared to be coping well with the damaged bones in his right hand, will also start from the fourth row after finishing only twelfth fastest on his Camel Yamaha, more than a second slower than Pedrosa. The Australian Chris Vermeulen qualified second fastest on his Rizla Suzuki, from Fortuna Honda's Marco Melandri."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
