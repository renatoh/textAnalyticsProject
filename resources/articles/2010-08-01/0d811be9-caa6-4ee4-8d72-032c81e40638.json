Deafening, because it has previously demonstrated that if it is not happy with media reports it will let everyone know. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Bloomberg reported that CIC may have had more than $5bn (\u00a33.15bn) of its money frozen after the US authorities blocked withdrawals from the Reserve Primary Fund. The report made a ripple in the business press: a bit in Forbes here, a mention in a New York Times blog there. But not much. Yet it prompted a long statement on the semantics relating to these reports, in which CIC stressed that it was not a shareholder in the Reserve Primary and that it was going to try to get its money back. Compare CIC's outspoken reaction then to how it responded to the many reports across the globe yesterday and there is a marked difference. Yesterday there was no official statement from CIC. There were no quotes from officials. One \"statement\" prepared by Huang's Hong Kong-based PR firm was later retracted as \"not official\". What was official was the following: \"Please be informed that there will be no media statement from Mr Kenny Huang today.\" And there you have it: until CIC says otherwise, we can carry on assuming that the \u00a3351.4m CIC has raised, as revealed by Digger yesterday, remains earmarked for Liverpool. Bates loses legal adviser Ken Bates has provided a guidebook on how to get round the spirit of the Football League's new ownership transparency rules but appears to have done so without the assistance of his long-term legal lieutenant, Mark Taylor. This column revealed yesterday how the ownership statement of Leeds United, where Bates is chairman, left fans no closer to understanding who owns their club \u2013 the very point of rules on the declaration of shareholdings above 10%. But Taylor, who for about 20 years advised Bates on the legal issues of his running of clubs in all their various incarnations (and there have been many) has apparently parted company with the 78-year-old Leeds chairman. Taylor quit as a director at Elland Road on 13 May, the same day Peter Lorimer and Yvonne Todd returned to the board, the latter this time under the name of Yvonne Allen. When Digger regrettably interrupted Taylor's lunch yesterday to ask whether he still represented Bates in any capacity, the answer was an emphatic \"no\". Yeovil fans seek answers Talking of transparency, Digger got on to Yeovil Town again yesterday, once more asking to look at the documents relating to the club's decision to separate the property assets from their football operation. The answer, again, was no. Apparently the club's chairman, John Fry, has got the hump that this column suggested fans should keep a close eye on a development that has caused problems for Crystal Palace, Southend United and others over the years. Now it looks like fans are facing a similar wall of silence. A fans' group has written an open letter to Fry asking: \"Please can you explain the benefits of pursuing the sale of Yeovil Town's property assets, potentially including Huish Park, and the splitting of these assets from those of the footballing operation? What long-term assurances can you, the club, provide us, the fans, with regarding the long-term security of Yeovil Town Football Club?\" Fry has a strong record as a good custodian of the club but the longer he maintains his silence over the asset separation, the likelier it is that people will assume the worst. HMRC's Cardiff consolation The taxman had a bad day at the high court over Portsmouth yesterday but at least HM Revenue &amp; Customs could take some cheer after it received a seven-figure sum from Cardiff City. The defeated Championship play-off finalists had faced a court date next Wednesday and were labouring under a transfer embargo. But that was overturned yesterday after the Welsh club repaid all their debts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
