Kevin Pietersen will do well because he's a big-match player: The Oval 2005 tells you that, whereas Warwickshire Seconds at Birmingham last week was never going to bring the best out of him. He is crucial because Andrew Strauss wants people to rise to the occasion, and Pietersen won't be afraid of the situation. But we will need to see a slightly different Pietersen \u2013 someone who understands the need to make big hundreds and not get out in the 90s. He loves to entertain and he wants to be loved. It annoys him that Andrew Flintoff gets more adulation than him. But Andy Flower needs to make him understand that the best way to be loved is not to raise your bat for 100, it's to make three big hundreds and win the man of the series award. Mike Gatting, former England captain Not at all. I think the spinners might have a bit to do with it, and then of course there's Fred. If England are going to beat Australia, they're all going to have to play well. I just hope Kevin doesn't put too much pressure on himself, which he can do sometimes, but then that's the nature of being the best player. Ravi Bopara has a big role to play on Pietersen's behalf, acting as a buffer zone at No3. James Anderson has been going extremely well, too. The way he's been bowling he could be the man. Rahul Dravid, India batsman Pietersen will be important for England but he can't do it on his own. If they are to win this Ashes they are going to need contributions from more than just him \u2013 like in 2005. In fact if others contribute, it will free him up and he'll be at his most dangerous if he can express himself knowing that it's not all about his runs. He is a terrific player. He's got great desire and hunger and is a big-match player, so expect big things from him at crucial stages during the Ashes. But he won't beat Australia on his own. Mick Newell, Nottinghamshire coach There's a lot more to it than Kevin Pietersen, but it would be surprising if England did win the Ashes if he had a poor series. When you look at the line-up, with five batters and a wicketkeeper at No6, then his role becomes even more massive. I think it's a bit of a risk because of the way Andrew Flintoff's batting at the moment. I'd have him below Stuart Broad at No8. But Pietersen loves the pressure. I saw both his dismissals in the warm-up game against Warwickshire and it just looked like a complete lack of interest on his part. But when the eyes of the world are on him in Cardiff, he'll be ready. Mick Newell was Pietersen's former coach at Nottinghamshire CCC Gary Pratt, substitute fielder in 2005 KP loves playing under pressure and he's going to have to perform if England are going to win. He wasn't quite born to be hated, but he loves having his back to the wall. Look at the way he played in South Africa a few years back. They hated him. If all the focus is on KP, that might take the pressure off Andrew Flintoff and someone like [Ravi] Bopara, who might be able to play more freely. But I think Graeme Swann will play a big part. The Aussies might underestimate him and over-attack. They don't think much of finger-spinners. Gary Pratt ran out Ricky Ponting at Trent Bridge in 2005 David Lloyd, former England coach No. He's a part of it. I think it's going to be a bowler who's going to bring in the special performance to win games. We all talk about 20 wickets wins the Test match, so who's the bowler? My key would be Jimmy Anderson. He's on top of his game and you can't get away from him if he stays fit. He's got reverse swing and normal swing, and his control is improving all the time. Angus Fraser, Middlesex director of cricket I don't know if he's the key. You've got to take 20 wickets to win Tests, so a bowler's more likely to be influential. That's how England won the series four years ago. But one thing Pietersen does do \u2013 apart from rising to the big occasion \u2013 is score quickly. That gives the bowlers lots of time to bowl a side out twice, and that's his real strength. And when he gets in, he makes big hundreds. He will have a huge role to play, but I think a lot more depends on James Anderson or maybe even Stuart Broad. Ray Jennings, Pietersen's IPL coach England's bowling is good but they have not been batting as well as they can, so KP will be the key. His fighting spirit is his greatest strength and he likes the limelight. All his best performances have come in big situations and the Ashes certainly is that. Plus, he has done exceptionally well against Australia before. It's the right time for England to be playing them because they are weaker than they have been for a long time. Ray Jennings coached Pietersen's Bangalore Royal Challengers during the Indian Premier League Ray Illingworth, former England captain Pietersen is certainly key from a batting point of view, but it's bowlers who decide Test matches. You need 20 wickets and that's the simple truth of it. Anderson is bowling very well and if he can control the swing, that will count for a lot. You have to control the game in the field. I think England are right to go in with five bowlers \u2013 the extra batsman rarely makes a difference \u2013 and they're right to play Matt Prior at No6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
