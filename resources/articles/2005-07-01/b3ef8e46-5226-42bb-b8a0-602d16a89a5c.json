The barley fields are golding and although the tall grasses ripen silver and bronze, their stems still taste green. Ringlet butterflies flick through the heat and small whites are dancing in groups of three or four or mating on the wing. I duck into the woods for shade and scramble down to the lower edge to sit under an old lime tree, breathing in its thick, sweetly intoxicating scent. From this point, looking south-west, I peer across hazy miles to the hills of the Long Mynd and Stiperstones. Between these charismatic ridges is the Upper Onny Valley where two streams, the West and the East Onny rise and flow through an enchanting vale to merge as one river. This then joins the river Teme at Ludlow which in turn finds the Severn further south. I've just received a book about the Upper Onny Valley, which was researched and written by 30 people in seven parishes; it's full of the history, geology, wildlife, legend and literature of life along the East and West Onny. I have a lifelong fascination with that area and it's great to have a book that speaks about it. But it's even better that the book comes from the communities that live in the valley - and it's written from the heart. These places get into your blood. As I'm sitting, watching the hills and their valleys, I'm aware of something landing on my neck. I brush it off to discover it's a type of horsefly and pretty soon I feel the effects of its bite. Although the little bugger flew off and left me with an itch I'm still scratching, I like the idea that some of my blood is flying about in the landscape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
