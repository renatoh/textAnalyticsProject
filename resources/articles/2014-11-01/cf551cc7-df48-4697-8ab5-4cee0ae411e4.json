It would only be boosted further by the prospect of thousands of Irish supporters taking seats in the home sections of the stadium. Gordon Strachan, though, has firmly rejected any sense of domestic links or familiarity being pertinent to this crucial Group D fixture. Strachan bridled at the suggestion Ireland may feel perfectly comfortable in surroundings once successfully inhabited by Martin O\u2019Neill and, for a more brief period, his assistant Roy Keane. Strachan himself took charge of Celtic for four years. \u201cTomorrow night, that is Scottish territory and you\u2019ll know it\u2019s Scottish territory,\u201d Strachan insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in no doubt where you are tomorrow \u2013 you\u2019re in Scotland and Scotland are playing, against Ireland. It\u2019s not a Celtic crowd tomorrow, it\u2019s a Scottish crowd. There are a lot of things that are different. You can\u2019t compare them, it\u2019s two different entities. I believe the atmosphere will be terrific but in a different way.\u201d Not that Scotland\u2019s manager is in any way reluctant to dismiss the value of home advantage. He was part of the process which decided upon Celtic Park rather than Ibrox \u2013 where Scotland recently hosted Georgia \u2013 for this game. Hampden is still recovering from the rigours attached to hosting the Commonwealth Games, hence the national team have been forced to do things a little differently. \u201cWe are going to get 55,000 Scots in there tomorrow,\u201d Strachan added. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done that anywhere else and that will help us. For these two games, against Ireland and England, I think we have done the right thing. \u201cIt will inspire all the players. It will manage to get another few per cent out of them. They can drink all the water they want, eat all the carbohydrates they want but the extra bit will come from our fans.\u201d That brief mention of England\u2019s upcoming visit to Glasgow rather sums up the Scottish mood. Tuesday night\u2019s friendly has paled into insignificance against the Ireland match, a matter intensified by the impressive start O\u2019Neill\u2019s side have made to their qualifying section. Three points separate the two teams; Scotland cannot afford that gap to double. \u201cIt is a pat on the back for the players that they have generated this interest,\u201d said Strachan. \u201cIt is great for them because when the game was announced against England that was the big game. But that has been put on the back burner now. So that is great \u2013 terrific.\u201d Strachan concurs with the general view that his team and the Irish are evenly-matched. Typically, though, the 57-year-old has moved to play down the wider significance of what is a rare meeting of these two nations in competitive form. \u201cI went out yesterday to the cinema and I met a lot of people. That is when the excitement started,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got it right. We don\u2019t get them too high for a game no matter if it\u2019s Germany or Georgia and we want to strike a balance. The coaches set the standard and I detach myself from the madness that surrounds it \u2013 which is a great madness for everyone bar the players. It\u2019s good to have excitement but I\u2019m totally detached from the media side of things and just get on with it. \u201cThe squads are strong. We\u2019re working in the same sort of areas, the same sort of leagues. There are some terrific players in the Irish side backed up with good players. There is no player in any squad you think is out of place.\u201d Scotland (probable) 4-2-3-1: Marshall; Whittaker, Hanley, Martin, Robertson; Brown, Morrison; Maloney, Naismith, Anya; S Fletcher.
