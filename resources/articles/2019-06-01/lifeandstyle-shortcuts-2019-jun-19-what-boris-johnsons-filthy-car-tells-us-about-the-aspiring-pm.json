The photographs of his messy car \u2013 as shambolic as its owner \u2013 will be familiar to many of us. The shots of the inside of his Toyota are a still life of slovenliness, featuring empty food cartons, water bottles, crumpled clothes, discarded children\u2019s books, crumbs and receipts. It is either homely or filthy, depending on whether or not you are the sort of person who has to apologise for the mess every time you give someone a lift. What it isn\u2019t is prime ministerly. Margaret Thatcher, a premier with a penchant for dusting, would be appalled. \u201cI\u2019m in shock,\u201d says Lynsey Crombie, the cleaning expert known online as the Queen of Clean. \u201cA tidy car is a tidy mind.\u201d Crombie only uses her car a couple of times a week, so she cleans it every month. \u201cIn a car that you use every day, you should try and spend 10 minutes on it every week. Prioritise getting the clutter and rubbish out. Take out the stuff that doesn\u2019t need to be there \u2013 do you really need to have loads of books and a sports kit that\u2019s not been washed?\u201d She recommends at least a wipe round the steering wheel \u201cwith a damp microfibre cloth with a small amount of product. Maybe once a year, look at the upholstery and give that a clean or, if it\u2019s leather, wipe it over every so often. And bash the floor mats.\u201d She adds that it could be dangerous if a plastic bottle or drinks can were to get stuck under a pedal. There may be other issues if you drive a dirty car. A study by Nottingham University in 2015 tested messy cars, taking swabs from steering wheels, gear sticks and footwells, and found evidence of Staphylococcus and E coli. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage kids to eat in cars,\u201d says cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie. \u201cCrumbly biscuits end up everywhere. Always carry an empty carrier bag in the car \u2013 it means everything can go straight in the bag and doesn\u2019t get left on the floor.\u201d But she confesses to being fairly relaxed about vehicular orderliness: \u201cWhen I had small kids, it was kind of my guilty dirty area. If we were ever on a long journey, I\u2019d be up to my knees in discarded papers and banana skins. Then you clear it all up again.\u201d Still, she thinks Johnson\u2019s car is \u201chilarious\u201d. It\u2019s partly a class thing, she says. \u201cToffs don\u2019t care about the mess they live in, and actually why would he need to worry about anything so pifflingly unimportant as the inside of his car? That\u2019s another argument, but I do think there\u2019s something about a state of chaos that\u2019s bound to spill over into his own head and life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
