He's clearly a pianist who revels in technical challenges, for Grimwood has now turned his attention to the Russian virtuoso tradition. His Wigmore recital, which replicated the contents of his latest disc and was played on a thoroughly modern Steinway, was devoted to two composers who were close friends and contemporaries: Sergei Rachmaninov and, more intriguingly, Felix Blumenfeld. The Ukrainian Blumenfeld (1863-1931) was a pianist, conductor and teacher. He conducted the first Russian performance of Wagner's Tristan, while his pupils at the Kiev Conservatory included Vladimir Horowitz. His own music is more or less forgotten now, but Grimwood disinterred two substantial works: the Six Pieces Op 38, composed in 1906, and the Sonata-Fantasy Op 46 of seven years later. Both are fluent, slightly overheated works. The set of miniatures are full of aqueous imagery, though the programme notes' claim that one of them prefigures Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit seems just a bit far-fetched, and they are couched very much in a post-Lisztian bravura style, with few specifically Russian inflections. But the sonata is definitely tougher-edged, more harmonically adventurous and full of abrupt changes of direction, distantly echoing Scriabin perhaps, more than Rachmaninov. But it was Rachmaninov and his clamorous first piano sonata that came afterwards; Grimwood obviously loves music with lots of notes and lots of noise. Technically, he's certainly fearless \u2013 there were a few moments of over-pedalling to ease him through the more treacherous passages in the Blumenfeld sonata \u2013 though his slightly wiry sound was a bit too unremittingly loud for comfort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
