They say he would not have beaten Floyd Mayweather in their heyday and he hasn't got a prayer against him now. They say he's too old, got too much stuff going on in his crazily busy life. They might be right. But tell it to Timothy Bradley. For about 80% of their fight in Las Vegas on Saturday night, the old man who has won versions of world titles at eight weights in the course of 63 fights not only reminded the younger champion how good he has been. He also put to bed the injustice of their first meeting nearly two years ago, when two judges somehow handed the unbeaten American Pacquiao's WBO welterweight belt. This time, the gap between them was obvious enough for the officials to get it right. Even allowing for a subliminal corrective urge, perhaps, on behalf of their errant colleagues who got it so wrong in the same ring in June 2012, Michael Pernick and Craig Metcalfe (both 116-112) and Glenn Trowbridge (118-110) did a competent job. Bradley was commendably gracious. Having oddly claimed he won eight of the 12 rounds in their first fight, he conceded in defeat, \"Pacquiao was the better man tonight. He still has it. I have respect for him.\" In the early exchanges, they swung like kids in the playground, short, muscled arms carving the air at the end of some ugly lunging. But once Pacquiao found his range \u2013 and it took him maybe five minutes \u2013 Bradley suffered. The American has been a good world champion, but the Filipino has a better take on the art of boxing. He's just smarter, quicker, hits harder. Even on television, you could sense Pacquiao's hunger. The Congressman is 35 and his wife will deliver him a fifth child very soon, but on Saturday night he was all business. There would be no coasting to the bell as when he gave the judges wriggle room last time. Bradley said later his calf went on him in early in the fight. Well, he hid the pain well and there was no visible evidence that it constrained his movement. In fact, he chased and harried with power and energy to take rounds three and four, and it looked like we had a war on our hands. Once that Desert Storm had blown through, however, it was difficult to give Bradley a round, even when he came to life in brief spurts. This is how I saw it: Rd 1: 10-10 Rd 2: 10-9 Pacquiao, close Rd 3: 10-9 Bradley, close Rd 4: 10-9 Bradley, clearly Rd 5: 10-9 Pacquiao, just Rd 6: 10-9 Pacquaio, with little coming back Rd 7: 10-9 Pacquiao, easily Rd 8: 10-9 Pacquiao, close, but worked more Rd 9: 10-9 Pacquiao, clearly, best round Rd 10: 10-9 Pacquiao, closer Rd 11: 10-9 Pacquiao, easily enough Rd 12 10-9 Pacquiao, ditto. Looking at that scorecard, maybe it would help clarify matters if judges had to provide a brief explanation of their score. We might then know what makes them do the weird things they do. So, could Pacquaio give Mayweather a credible argument? Certainly, but, on this and other showings since his last dominant performance (and stoppage) \u2013 against Miguel Cotto in November, 2009 \u2013 I very much doubt he would convince even sympathetic officials he had the measure of a champion who seems to get even better with age. Unlike Mayweather, Pacquiao's problem is (and always has been) his defence. The older fighters get, the more punches they take; there are two good reasons for this: they slow down and they stop caring, because one punch seems no different to the thousands that have gone before \u2013 unless it is loaded, like the short, nuclear right from Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez that exploded on Pacquaio's chin in December 2012. That knockout would have wrecked most fighters \u2013 as Pacquiao's dramatic finisher on Ricky Hatton in May 2009, effectively did for the Manchester warrior. But Pacquiao has an eerily calm resignation about his trade. Defeat does not seem to unsettle him. He is philosophically comfortable with his fate. Maybe that's down to his religion. This is, remember, a man who stands by his claim that he has actually clapped eyes on Jesus. However, he will need more than faith against Mayweather \u2013 if it ever happens. A lot of boxing people have stopped caring, because it is the fight that should have happened years ago. But they will care on the night. The fight business has no reliable memory. It sees only the bottom line, and fans will watch what they are sold because they are blood addicts. And, when the calculating Mayweather has a good look at the tape of this one, he will be comfortable offering a reduced version of his old foe a pension fight some time in 2015. Wise guy comes a cropper There are guarantees in this business \u2013 whatever the cynics reckon. Frank Buglioni, the fighter they call The Wise Guy, now knows that better than most. In the first leg of BoxNation's through-the-night coverage, from the Copper Box Arena in London, Buglioni ran into reality in his 13th fight \u2013 as he suspected he might at some point \u2013 when the gnarled old campaigner from Minsk, Sergey Khomitsky, took his unbeaten record and his WBO European super-middleweight title with a brutal stoppage in the sixth round. Khomitzky buzzed him with hooks he should have seen coming in the third, to temple and jaw, and added a couple of long rights for good measure. \"You can't keep taking them shots,\" Mark Tibbs told him between rounds. He had a better fourth, a very tough fifth and a disastrous sixth, when the self-belief seemed to drain from him. His reluctance to step up his work-rate gave Khomitsky the encouragement to unload with vicious, unanswered head shots, and Tibbs called him back to the corner on unsteady feet after a minute of minor hell. Buglioni never thought he was going to have an easy night against a durable opponent who had beaten Jamie Moore and run Ryan Rhodes and Martin Murray close in previous visits to the UK. Beforehand, the Londoner told BoxNation's Steve Lillis: \"He's a very good fighter, very experienced, he's come to win, he travels well. He's not a journeyman.\" He is not. What he is, though, is another happy veteran with a new bauble to polish. Simon Barclay's professional debut at 24 went smoothly, meanwhile. The rangy cruiser from Corby has still got some amateur stiffness but also the pedigree of two ABA titles, and he speared long, stiff jabs into the reddened face of Igor Borucha convincingly enough over four rounds to hand the 33-year-old Lithuanian his 24th loss in 32 fights. Barclay could do well. Georgie Kean is an ambitious young Islington welterweight with decent skills, and he reckoned a move across the Thames to Adam Booth's camp was what he needed after only three pro fights. But the switch (with Gary Logan in his corner) brought him his first loss when the awkward and seasoned William Warburton fiddled him out of it over four rounds, deservedly, to celebrate only his 12th win in 75 contests. As the astute Barry Jones observed, Georgie needs to relax. No guarantees indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
