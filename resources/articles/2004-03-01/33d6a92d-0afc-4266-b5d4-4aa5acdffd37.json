The deal ends three months of uncertainty since Leeds announced a financial standstill arrangement with their major creditors, and two months of detailed negotiations involving hundreds of lawyers. Krasner, an insolvency practitioner with chartered accountants Bartfields and who has been the consortium's representative over the last few weeks, has been named as Leeds' new chairman. He will head up a six-man board which includes former Leeds legend Peter Lorimer, who will become a director and be responsible for interacting with the media. Other names include property developers Simon Morris and Melvyn Helme, the latter to be corporate finance director as he was a former NatWest bank high-flier, entrepreneur Melvyn Levi and David Richmond, son of former Bradford chairman Geoffrey who has been acting as an unpaid advisor. As part of the deal, administrators have been appointed to Leeds United plc and a subsidiary company, Leeds United Holdings Ltd, companies which will later be wound up. Their debts will be taken on by Leeds United AFC at a reduced level. Geoffrey Richmond, acting as an advisor to the consortium, told said that the consortium had raised \"in excess of \u00a320million\" to seal the takeover deal. He admitted that perhaps the biggest task facing the new consortium will be to tackle the huge wage bill at Elland Road. \"We have to cut costs,\" said Richmond. \"We have 60 professionals at Leeds - that's first-year professionals right up to internationals - and 15 of those 60 professionals are on \u00a31million or more. It's unsustainable.\" Richmond revealed that one player earned in excess of \u00a33.5million a year but ruled out any suggestion that the consortium might try to renegotiate some players' contracts. \"It is impossible to renegotiate a contract. That contract was negotiated in good faith and there is no question of the club renegotiating contracts.\" \"However some contracts - \u00a311million worth of player contracts - come to an end on June 30 and it is unlikely that any of those will be renewed.\" A Leeds statement said: \"It was confirmed today that a financial deal has been reached and Leeds United Football Club has been saved from administration. \"No details will be released regarding the financial arrangements of the agreement except to say an eight-figure deal was agreed between the club and a Yorkshire-based consortium, following seven weeks of negotiations. Gerald Krasner, the face of the consortium, said: \"We want to be solely judged by our actions, there has been too much speculation. \"There has been rumour and counter rumour regarding the future of both Elland Road and Thorp Arch and, once again, we can categorically reassure fans that Leeds United will not be moving from Elland Road. \"As for Thorp Arch, contracts were already in place to sell a tract of land at the training ground which isn't currently used by the club, but there are no further plans to sell the site or move the Academy as it forms a crucial and integral part of our business strategy and the clubs future. \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has made this deal possible, specifically Trevor Birch, Neil Robson and Geoffrey Richmond, who has given substantial help as a consultant, as well as the experts at Walker Morris solicitors and Baker Tilly accountants. \"Without their input and support then we could have been looking at a very different future for the club but, instead, we are now poised to move forward and turn Leeds United around.\" The consortium has been greeted with sceptism by some Leeds fans, but Richmond insisted: \"Judge us on our actions. We are all Leeds people and I would just say to Leeds fans - don't prejudge anything.\" Richmond, who described Kranser as \"a tough cookie\" who was \"very straightforward\" stressed that he will not be joining the new board. \"I made it clear to the consortium from the beginning that I wasn't interested in being an investor, shareholder or director.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
