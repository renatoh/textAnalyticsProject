The figure should have been \u00a315.37m, rather than \u00a32.26m (In sight of victory, page 1, Technology, March 20). \u00b7 Heather Mills's charitable donations, recorded in the part of the divorce case judgment released to the public, are \u00a3627,000 and not \u00a3627 as we had it in a panel headed The assets, page 7, March 19. \u00b7 A photograph with a profile of the British windsurfer Bryony Shaw did not show her, but another competitive windsurfer, Antonia Frey (Shaw rides the choppy waves towards Beijing gold, page 10, Sport, March 19). The picture was wrongly captioned by the agency that supplied it. \u00b7 Walter Matthau was paired with Jack Lemmon, not George Burns, in The Odd Couple. He and Burns appeared together in The Sunshine Boys. Also, biblical quotations are more likely to come from the King James Version than the St James Version (Last night's TV, page 31, G2, March 20). \u00b7 The average score for The Deep Blue Sea with Greta Scacchi in Richmond should have been seven out of 10, not four (Review of reviews, page 29, G2, March 17)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
