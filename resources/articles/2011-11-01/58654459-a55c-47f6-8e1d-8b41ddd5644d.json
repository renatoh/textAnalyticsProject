Reference point, his interpreter muttered. The manager was talking about Scott Parker. He did not say much more, but for a player in the Tottenham Hotspur man's position, compliments cannot come much higher. \"In front of the back four, he's very important,\" Capello was saying. \"When the centre\u2011back receives the ball or wins back the ball, he's the point of reference.\" In an unconventional but ultimately effective formation, Parker was stationed in front of the central defenders, shielding them against the infiltrations of Spain's small, quick forwards. Ahead of him was a line of three \u2013 Theo Walcott, Frank Lampard and James Milner \u2013 with Phil Jones surprisingly deployed just in front of them, charged with disrupting the supply of passes from Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets. Four lines, then, in a 4-1-3-1 defence, squeezed most of the time into no more than 20 yards: an acknowledgement that the game would be played largely in England's half, and a means of stifling Spain's constant movement and fluent interplay, with its bewildering angles and sudden changes of rhythm. Ahead of them, and mostly out of earshot, Darren Bent waited for the set-piece from which his touch set up Lampard's goal. Parker started the game with a scar on his nose, the legacy of a hurtful connection with Steve Sidwell's elbow during Spurs' win at Craven Cottage seven days earlier. It was a symbol of the resilience that would win him the official man\u2011of\u2011the\u2011match award against Spain, along with warm applause from the Wembley crowd as he left the pitch after 85 minutes. This was a contest in which statistics turned out to be as irrelevant as Alonso's pre-match claim that tackling is not an aspect of the game to be taught to young players. The number of Parker's tackles \u2013 four \u2013 or his pass completion rate \u2013 37 out of 46, for an average of 80.4% \u2013 or even the number of times he lost the ball \u2013 11, with 10 recoveries \u2013 were less important than the fact of his presence in Capello's unusual and, in the end, justifiable formation. Yes, it was only a friendly. No, Spain are not unbeatable in such circumstances, as Argentina, Portugal and Italy have proved since the World Cup (and they are not bad company for England to be among). Certainly, Vicente del Bosque would have left Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Iker Casillas on the pitch for the second half had there been something significant at stake, and the visitors' overall intensity might have been a few percentage points higher. But thanks to a display of pragmatism and wholehearted effort, England at least took the opportunity to raise their morale by a notch or two. Managers often stress the need for unbroken concentration and few England teams can have concentrated on their appointed task as relentlessly as Capello's players did on Saturday. That narrow focus enabled them to snatch the ball away from the Spaniards on a surprising number of occasions, given the visitors' reputation for guarding it with such efficiency. It also ensured that whenever David Villa or David Silva looked like penetrating the last layer of cover, two defenders would have anticipated the danger and be in position to converge on him. Until the last 20 minutes, when first Villa and then Cesc F\u00e1bregas might have put a different complexion on the evening, Spain had few clear chances, and Parker, winning his 10th cap, played as important a role as anyone, even the two excellent centre\u2011backs, in restricting their opportunities. If his distribution in the early stages was no more precise than that of several of his colleagues, it was because England were set up \u2013 in the mind as much as on the pitch \u2013 to contain rather than expand the play. \"At times it was difficult,\" Parker said. \"We were playing against arguably the best midfielders in the world. They had plenty of the ball and they'll have some good stats but we'll take the result. Maybe we struggled going forward to retain the ball but we were working so hard to defend. Ultimately we've proved we can stick together as a team and limit them to so few chances. We learnt about ourselves tonight. This is new for a lot of us and it was very pleasing.\" It made you wonder, not for the first time, why a full appreciation of his gifts has been so slow to come. A question of late development, or of myopia among leading managers? For Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Parker could have supplied a perfect solution to Arsenal's post-Gilberto Silva weakness in the holding area, while Capello should have spotted his qualities in time to take him to South Africa as a fundamental part of the team. The Italian was full of justified praise for the performance of his younger players, notably Jack Rodwell, who seized his chance with commendable alacrity. But it was the 31-year-old in the No8 shirt who provided the point of reference, and to whom the younger newcomers can now look for an example of how to play without ego while putting every ounce of yourself into each performance. At long last, Scott Parker is here to stay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
