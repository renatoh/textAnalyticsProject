Author David Leser thinks so", "bodyText": "It was December 2017 and, like most of the world, veteran Sydney journalist David Leser was transfixed by the millions of women speaking out about sexual assault as part of the MeToo movement. \u201cIt was the biggest social movement of my lifetime,\u201d Leser tells Guardian Australia. Around the same time, the 63-year-old was asked by the editor of Nine\u2019s Good Weekend to write for the magazine. \u201cI said, \u2018The only story I\u2019m interested in writing is the Harvey Weinstein story.\u2019 That, to me, was the biggest story in the world,\u201d he says. Duly commissioned, Leser says the Good Weekend article \u2013 titled Men, Women and the Whole Damn Thing \u2013 started with the central question: \u201cCould a man \u2013 should a man \u2013 do this story?\u201d For some, the answer was yes. After all, the story of women\u2019s oppression can\u2019t be told without examining men\u2019s role as oppressors. But, for others, the thought that a man might be writing about women\u2019s pain, and might be offered significant platforms for his thoughts, was mansplaining in extremis \u2013 especially when the Good Weekend cover story was followed by a book deal. In the Australian, columnist Nikki Gemmell wrote: \u201cIt seems, uncomfortably, that men feel the need to colonise this courageous, fraught, intensely female #MeToo moment. And of course they\u2019re enabled; they always are. Men power through, drowning out our voices; they endure, cling on, mansplain to us.\u201d Van Badham told the Guardian\u2019s Amanda Meade: \u201cThis is precisely the structural sexism that MeToo has illuminated, and we\u2019re staring at it, and it\u2019s so very ugly.\u201d Elsewhere on feminist forums and social media, Australian women were incensed that the long-awaited moment of reckoning via the MeToo movement would be filtered through a male lens. Leser speaks to Guardian Australia at the Byron Bay writers\u2019 festival, where he is launching his book, also called Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing. \u201cIf you say a man shouldn\u2019t write this book, my answer to that is men are the ones are perpetrating the violence, mostly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority of them are doing the abuse, the rapes, the [domestic] violence. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on men to know why men are doing this and to talk about it and to examine the models of manhood we\u2019ve been given, so that we understand it.\u201d As for his feminist critics: \u201cThe attacks on Van [Badham] by men online have been so vile, so poisonous, so hurtful. I can understand why \u2013 at first glance, not knowing me, not knowing what my motivations are \u2013 for her to have that visceral reaction. But I think anyone that knows me, that knows my journalism, would not take that view.\u201d Leser sees his book as extending the MeToo conversation \u201cby asking what is it in men that has created so much pervasive violence \u2013 and not just against women but against other men and against themselves.\u201d The book itself is almost two in one: an examination of the MeToo movement (less an analysis, more of a recap of the major events and key players in the months after October 2017) and an exploration of the dark side of masculinity. But a common theme throughout is misogyny. Leser argues that it wasn\u2019t always this way; that once, \u201cbefore the great creation legend of Genesis, before the myths of ancient Greece\u201d, where \u201cthe feminine was venerated\u201d, there were female healers, priestesses, lawmakers and warriors. It was only with time and \u201cnewer religions\u201d Christianity, Judaism and Islam, he says, that misogyny was seeded. Leser also discusses ways in which he believes men turn misogyny in on themselves. \u201cAs boys we quickly learn that these qualities we might loosely call feminine \u2013 tenderness, gentleness, vulnerability \u2013 are devalued and they are shamed, and they are repressed and often they are removed. \u201cAnd what do we say to boys? Don\u2019t be weak, don\u2019t be a sissy, don\u2019t cry. Boys learn when they are young to remove those parts of themselves that are part of their emotional range.\u201d Leser believes that this moment is particularly potent because the misogyny that has \u201ccoursed its way through history to the present day\u201d is now butting up against the \u201cunstoppable rise of women\u201d. He points to women in leadership positions, on company boards and in the corporate world as evidence of this unstoppable rise. But is women\u2019s ascent really as linear and uncomplicated as that? For all of the gains women have made \u2013 and they have been significant \u2013 there is the sense that things have stalled or in some cases gone backwards. Just ask a women outside the white, heterosexual mainstream how difficult it is to gain access to power, let alone find justice for those wrongs that are done to them. Leser\u2019s book contains interviews with second-wave feminists such as Helen Garner, traversing the so-called grey zones of sexual assault \u2013 ground that would be familiar to readers of The First Stone. It highlights, again, the political divisions between younger and older feminists. \u201cSome young people tend to think of themselves as a bubble of rights moving around the world and they\u2019re in this little shining enclosure and that\u2019s their rights,\u201d Garner says in the book. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone with road rage: anyone bumps against them and they go berko.\u201d Meanwhile, the voices of younger feminists and intersectional perspectives are largely absent. \u201cThe book should have been called Women, Men, The Whole Damn Thing Minus All the Things I Couldn\u2019t Talk About,\u201d Leser says. \u201cI was given five months to write this book. So there will be many things that readers will think should have been in the book or should not have been in the book. I could have spent months in Indigenous communities with the most at-risk women in this country. I could have spent months looking at the whole transgender LGBTQI community. I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t have time. I did what I could.\u201d So is this book written for men or women? Leser doesn\u2019t answer the question directly. \u201cThe act of writing is the act of understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have to write without looking over your shoulder or anticipating your audience because it\u2019s a terrifying and humbling task to write about something as fraught and complex as this.\u201d After getting the book contract, Leser interviewed people from around the world who are invested in the movement, such as former New Yorker editor Tina Brown; French secretary of equality Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa; and masculinity expert Michael Kimmel. Some of his interviewees had experienced abuse, some were accused of abuse, and some had devoted their lives to trying to make things better between the sexes. \u201cWriting this book reduced me to tears,\u201d Leser says. \u201cI was made privy to so much pain but there were times when I felt immobilised by that and I didn\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d There are suggestions in this book about where to go from here, alluded to in writer Benjamin Law\u2019s cover blurb, which says the book should be \u201cair-drop[ped] onto footy ovals, boardrooms, electoral offices and boys\u2019 schools\u201d. But they involve men first recognising then giving up some of their privileges. Which privileges have you given up, I ask Leser. He talks about his 23-year marriage to a feminist woman, now over. \u201cI thought I was a progressive male. Actually, my work was more important. My projects were more important. My ambitions were more important and my needs were more important. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why my marriage foundered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to do anything about that now ... I would never make that mistake again. I would try and bed down a reciprocity and a respect and a mutual regard for each other\u2019s lives and careers. When you see you are much further from where you might have been, it\u2019s a very sobering thing.\u201d \u2022 Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing by David Leser is out now through Allen and Unwin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
