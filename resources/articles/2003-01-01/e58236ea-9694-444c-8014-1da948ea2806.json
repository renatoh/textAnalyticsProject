If you have only a week to spend in Thailand, head straight for Chiang Rai and go to Chat House (Tel: 053-711481, 1 Thanon Trairat). They offer accommodation and guided treks from three days upwards (some of the guides are the same ones used by Intrepid/Guerba locally) and they are extremely experienced. Despite the Thai government improving its policies towards hill tribes as a result of tourism, treks such as these are, however, contributing to the decline of the hill-tribe culture, particularly for some tribes, and it is therefore worth researching what is on offer before you buy a tour that might have a negative impact. Alison Cutler \u00b7 Most high street agents will arrange this for you, but if you want to do it at a fraction of the cost, the best plan is to find the cheapest flight to Bangkok. Once there, jump on one of the many daily one-hour flights to Chiang Mai (about \u00a350) and then when you arrive, go into any travel shop or hotel lobby, where you can buy tours ranging from two days upwards. And haggle the price. Two weeks ago I took a two-day tour that included walking, jeep travel, rafting, riding on elephants, staying overnight with a Karen tribe, and all food. It cost only \u00a320 per head. I am sure that if I had booked it from the UK, it would have cost five or six times as much.
