A Romanian businessman had handed over \u20ac13,000 (\u00a311,000) to onlinewimbledontickets.com in the hope of securing four tickets \u2013 a pair for each of the men's and women's semi-finals. He was informed the tickets would be sent to his apartment. When they did not arrive on the appointed date All England Club officials claim the businessman was informed that the tickets had been forwarded to the club. On making contact with it this week, he was informed that he had become the victim of a suspected fraud. There have been 50 separate reports to the club that the website had taken payment for phantom tickets, and lawyers fear more will now emerge. \"The police are involved,\" confirmed a spokesman for the All England Club. The website has some credible branding, and claims \"Online Wimbledon Tickets is a trading name of a private company with limited liability\", with offices in Madrid and London, but no such company is registered at Companies House. Dace Brennan from Kew purchased tickets from the company and said: \"The order was paid on a credit card. The charge went through on the 24 June. [They] even sent through a signed order form, which was verified with VeriSign, Visa and my bank. I called to check on my tickets, the phone started with silence then disconnected to a dial tone. However, they answered my email saying my tickets would arrive one or two days before the event, but they never did.\" BBC runs out of room The BBC's interest in picking up broadcast rights for the Golden League of athletics has had to be deferred until after Wimbledon. The rights became available in the wake of Setanta's collapse and a spokeswoman for the corporation confirmed yesterday: \"At the moment we are looking at possible coverage options but we have not made any decisions.\" Tomorrow's Bislett Games in Oslo coincides with the men's semi-finals at SW19 and there is no room on the schedules for the athletics. Over and out John Rowlinson, the All England Club's head of broadcasting, is at his last Championships before heading for London 2012 to run its broadcasting output. The highly respected Rowlinson, who spent 30 years at the BBC before joining Wimbledon in 2002, will take charge of the International Broadcasting Centre at Stratford. Parrott is not that sick Not even Stephen Fry on an iPhone could have been busier tweeting yesterday than Travis Parrott. The 2009 Eastbourne doubles finalist was eagerly spreading the word of his good health after talk he had fallen victim to swine flu. Having confirmed a report that his doubles partner, Filip Polasek, had indeed been diagnosed with the disease, Parrott then got in touch with players from Jim Courier to Andy Roddick, and the world-leading doubles specialists the Bryan brothers, with the urgent message: \"Help me spread the word that I was NOT diagnosed with swine flu.\" Thames cuts corner ATP World Tour Finals organisers, who will be hosting the \"fifth grand slam\" at London's O2 arena in December, have innovative plans for the players to avoid the traffic that has occasionally paralysed the South-east London venue. In an effort to avoid the bottlenecks the boxer David Haye walked home after defeating Enzo Maccarinelli in March but the top eight tennis players will not face such indignity. Instead they will be shuttled back and forth from their hotel at the Marriott County Hall by river ferry. '\u00a3100 says my boy wins' There have been no updates from the predictably tight-lipped tennis authorities over the investigation into the suspicious betting patterns surrounding Wayne Odesnik's first-round straight-sets defeat to J\u00fcrgen Melzer, left, last week. But at least these days there is a level of sophistication to the suspicious activity that requires in-depth investigation, unlike in days of yore. One senior tennis insider told Digger yesterday that there had been a \"highly respected and very famous coach\" who used to be a Wimbledon betting shop regular and with the refrain: \"I'll have \u00a3100 on my boy today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
