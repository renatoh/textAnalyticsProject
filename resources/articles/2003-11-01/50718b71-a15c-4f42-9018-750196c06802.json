Prosecutor Richard Latham QC, opening the Crown's case on the first day of evidence, told the court that Mr Huntley, 29, \"chose to murder\" the two 10-year-olds and then hid their bodies, hoping that they would never be found. Mr Latham told the jury: \"We understand from those representing Huntley it is unlikely to be disputed by Huntley that the girls went into his home shortly after 6.30pm that evening, that Huntley was the only other person there at the time, and that they died within a short time of going inside his home.\" Mr Latham said that Holly and Jessica died soon after they \"fell into the hands\" of Mr Huntley, who allegedly murdered them for \"some reason known only to him\". The girls disappeared in their home village of Soham, Cambridgeshire, on the evening of Sunday August 4 2002. Mr Huntley denies murdering the two friends. Mr Latham said that, because Mr Huntley had pleaded not guilty, the focus of the trial was likely to centre on whether or not \"it could be construed that the deaths while he was there with them in his house amounted to murder\". The prosecutor told the jury that he was unable to call anyone for the prosecution who could tell what had happened in that house, saying that it was the prosecution's job to prove it was murder. The barrister said: \"We assert that after the deaths Huntley knew what he was doing. He could remember, he could understand, he was a man who - insofar as anyone who has killed two 10-year-old girls can be described as rational - was acting rationally.\" Mr Latham told the court, including the families of both girls, \"There is evidence of a calculating and manipulative individual who knew precisely what he was up to. He was trying to get away with murder.\" Carr 'helped devise dishonest account' Mr Huntley's former girlfriend Maxine Carr, 26, an ex-classroom assistant at Holly and Jessica's primary school in Soham, was also on trial. She denies one charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender. Mr Latham said: \"Her part was to provide Huntley with support for a wholly dishonest account of his movements and actions during the critical period, the Sunday evening of August 4.\" The pair sat in the dock, separated by a security guard. Mr Latham told the jury that, although they were sitting together, they were to be tried separately. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Carr was directly involved with the murders, but that she was accused of aiding Mr Huntley in devising a dishonest account of events. Mr Latham said that her behaviour was not \"an isolated judgment made on the spur of the moment ... it was a calculated and cold-blooded course ... involving repeated lies throughout the period of the disappearance of the girls and her arrest\". Huntley 'not seen for four hours' Mr Latham told the jury that Mr Huntley was seen 10 minutes before the girls left a sports centre in Soham at around 6.30pm, when they were heading in the direction of his home. He was not seen again by anyone until 10.30pm that night. Mr Latham said: \"It follows, members of the jury, Huntley's whereabouts for a period of about four hours - 6.15 to 10.30 - are unknown. The journey time from Soham to the place where the bodies were found takes approximately 30 to 40 minutes in a motor car. \"To drive there and back and leave the bodies, no more than a maximum of an hour and a half - and for four hours, his whereabouts are unknown.\" Mr Latham said: \"He had the presence of mind to remove the bodies from Soham and to hide them where he hoped they would not be found. \"By this time, as we know, the search was on, being recorded. Already, many local people were helping. Many went on helping right through the night.\" Mr Latham said that, soon after the search started, a small group of men had met Mr Huntley on a footpath. \"They asked Huntley if he had seen the two girls and he said he hadn't.\" Police Sergeant Pauline Nelson was responsible for the initial police response and search when the girls went missing, Mr Latham said. She noticed Mr Huntley with an alsatian-type dog in a crowd of people. His hair was wet and she thought that he had just had a shower. He was not really doing anything, Mr Latham said, but hovering around. He said that Mr Huntley was about six feet away from Sgt Nelson, where he could hear what was on her radio. Her car door was open. Mr Latham said: \"This is a feature of his behaviour from now onwards. He wants to know what's going on and who knows what.\" Huntley 'tells woman he had seen the girls' Mr Latham said that a woman teacher noticed Mr Huntley, whom she had met the previous week. She asked whether he had seen the girls, and he said: \"I have seen two girls. One of them asked me 'how is Miss Carr?' and I told her 'she's not very good or happy at the moment because she didn't get the job'.\" She asked Mr Huntley what time he had seen them, and he replied: \"It was about ten to six.\" The woman said: \"Not before or after that?\" Huntley replied: \"It was definitely ten to six.\" Asked where they had gone, he said \"over the bridge\", pointing towards College Road. The woman said they should tell Sgt Nelson, and began to tell the policewoman, the counsel said. However, when Sgt Nelson asked Mr Huntley, he replied: \"I can't remember, my head's a real muddle. I'm tired.\" The woman left Mr Huntley talking to Sgt Nelson. Mr Latham said: \"She formed the impression that, had she not asked, he would not have volunteered what he said.\" Sgt Nelson asked Mr Huntley when and where he had seen the girls, Mr Latham said. He added: \"We then have the beginnings, we suggest, of a story.\" Mr Huntley said that he saw them at 5.45pm in the car park of the Ross Peers sports centre. Sgt Nelson asked whether he had told anyone, and he said he had told the teacher. The sergeant asked why he had not told police. Mr Latham said: \"He avoided making eye contact, using his dog as a distraction.\" Mr Huntley eventually said that the teacher he told had not considered it important. He said that no one else was in the area when he saw the girls, and claimed they had walked off towards the library. Sgt Nelson remarked that he must have known them well, as he said they had stopped to talk to him. He replied: \"Yeah, my partner was their classroom assistant.\" The policewoman asked how he was sure it was 5.45pm. He replied: \"I just know it was 5.45pm.\" Mr Latham told the jury: \"At that moment, of course, he couldn't rely upon Ms Carr providing him with an alibi ... if the police happened to go to number 5 in the middle of the night, they would find she was not there. He had to be careful about what he said or did.\" Gap in sightings of Huntley Mr Latham said there was then an \"important gap\" in sightings of Mr Huntley until around 1am, and his car was missing during this time. A police officer involved in the search for the girls arrived at Soham Village college at around 11.45pm and drove past Mr Huntley's house, where his car was normally parked, but could not remember seeing it parked there. Another witness, who went past the house between midnight and 12.30am, told police that it was in \"complete darkness\" and the car was not outside, Mr Latham said. At 1am, a police dog handler saw Mr Huntley at his house, 5 College Close, and asked him who he was, the jury was told. \"He told the officer he was the caretaker and indicated where he lived. 'Are there any problems?' he said,\" Mr Latham told the jury. \"Huntley volunteered: 'I have got the keys to the college, do you want me to open it up for you?' She expressed gratitude.\" Mr Latham said that, moments later, Mr Huntley produced a bunch of keys and told the officer that if anyone had entered the college premises, the alarm should have gone off. After entering the college, Mr Huntley said the alarm had been on. Mr Latham said that computer records showed the school alarm was deactivated at 1.15am. He said that Mr Huntley spent around an hour walking around with the police searching for the two girls - after, according to the prosecution, he had already removed their bodies and dumped them miles away. Mr Latham said that when Mr Huntley eventually claimed he had seen the girls around, it was, in his submission, someone developing \"a defence in his mind\". He added: \"If anyone came forward to say they had seen him with the girls, just for a moment, it was far safer to have acknowledged that before he was confronted with it.\" Mr Latham said that the girls were described as \"two little Beckhams\" by a witness who saw them wearing matching Manchester United football shirts on the evening of their disappearance. \"Just under a fortnight later, in the early hours of Saturday August 17, Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr, who lived together at 5 College Close, were arrested on suspicion of the murder of the two girls,\" he said He said that hours earlier, at just before midnight on the Friday, police had made a \"very significant find\". Mr Huntley's red Ford Fiesta was also described as a \"key\" to the prosecution's case. The judge adjourned the trial, which continues at 10.30am tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
