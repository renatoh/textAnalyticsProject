The remarks come shortly after prime minister Scott Morrison weighed in on the matter, calling it \u201cconcerning\u201d Mike Pezzullo allegedly attempted to silence Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick. But Dutton said he understood Pezzullo\u2019s impulse in making the phone call, characterising Patrick as someone who would \u201cseek to misrepresent\u201d what he was told. \u201cSecretary Pezzullo and I discussed the matter this morning,\u201d Dutton said in a statement published by the ABC. \u201cLike me he is disgusted at some of the outrageous lies and slander he and I are regularly subject to, but nonetheless, I advised the secretary it was inappropriate to contact Senator Patrick, even if just to point out the inaccuracies in the senator\u2019s press release. \u201cFurther, I advised it was counter productive because I have always found Senator Patrick to be a person of the sort of character who would seek to misrepresent the Secretary\u2019s words, and the Secretary agreed the contact was not appropriate and that is where the matter ends.\u201d In response, Patrick said he found Dutton\u2019s comments to be unhelpful to the debate. \u201cI work constructively with ministers and government departments all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless, I understand Mr Pezzullo has been counselled and for me, that is the end of the matter.\u201d Pezzullo has strongly rejected the suggestion he sought to intimidate Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick, but acknowledged that he asked him to reflect on his \u201cunfounded\u201d comments in the wake of federal police raids on the ABC and News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst\u2019s home. Morrison earlier told reporters in Sydney: \u201cI do find those things concerning,\u201d adding that he had discussed the incident with the home affairs minister who \u201chas had an appropriate conversation with the secretary\u201d. Political fallout from the raids is set to continue, with calls from independent MP Andrew Wilkie for a parliamentary committee \u2013 to include minor parties and independents \u2013 to review national security laws. Labor has also accused the government of secrecy and called for a bipartisan push to review national security laws but declined to nominate any concrete changes it will pursue to improve press freedom. On Tuesday Morrison suggested that \u201cpress freedom is essential to our democracy\u201d while warning that \u201cno one is above the law\u201d. He noted that the raids were conducted under the Crimes Act as in-force in 2017 and 2018, before the espionage bill added a defence for journalists where they \u201creasonably believe\u201d dealing with secret information is in the public interest. Morrison said if there was \u201cevidence or any analysis that reveals there is a need for further improvement of those laws, the government is open to that\u201d \u2013 without endorsing calls for a fresh review. Patrick has been one of the fiercest critics of the raids, including suggesting there is a double standard with leaks embarrassing to the government pursued more vigorously than others, and claiming that Pezzullo and Dutton \u201cclearly hate media scrutiny\u201d. Patrick revealed in a post on Facebook that Pezzullo called him to complain about those comments. \u201cPezzullo suggested these remarks had \u2018slandered him\u2019, though he quickly indicated he would not take that any further, before remonstrating with me for making my remarks from my position of \u2018high office\u2019 in circumstances in which he claimed he had no real ability to respond,\u201d Patrick wrote. \u201cHe took the view that while I was in my rights as a senator to comment about and indeed criticise his minister, Peter Dutton, I should refrain from commentary about him, the secretary of home affairs.\u201d The Greens senator Jordan Steele-John revealed that Pezzullo had also personally complained to him regarding criticisms of the encryption bill and \u201cthe secrecy of his department\u201d. Patrick told Guardian Australia that Pezzullo was \u201cpolite\u201d and \u201cnot aggressive or rude\u201d but felt pressure when he \u201creflected on the purpose\u201d of the call to stop his public criticism. Patrick said the phone call \u201cfrom the chief bureaucrat overseeing a national security juggernaut, effectively a ministry of state security\u201d left him with \u201cthe distinct impression of a menacing tone in his remarks and an unmistakable message that criticism and scrutiny is not welcome\u201d. \u201cIn a quiet but significant way I was the subject of the next stage of oversight clampdown where the apparatus moves from intimidating the media, who are charged with the responsibility of informing the public of questionable conduct by government officials, to intimidating members of the parliament who have a constitutional responsibility to oversight government.\u201d In a statement to the ABC, Pezzullo said he had \u201cno view and nor should I express a view on how senator Patrick conducts himself or on the issues that he chooses to pursue as a senator\u201d. \u201cMy sole request made to him by telephone was to ask that he reflect on his adverse references to my purported view of media scrutiny,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cHis comments were unfounded and not able to be responded to by me in the media as quite properly I lack the public platform that he has, and uses. \u201cI was very grateful that he took my call and appreciative of the fact that he undertook to consider my representations, which of course he was under no obligation to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
