Hotly tipped (no, really) Rough Trade signings who look set to be the next Strokes/Vaccines-type indie guitar sensation. That they sound like a hybrid of the Strokes and the Vaccines (with an old Elvis Presley riff on I Told You Once) can only help. Do we need yet another band with trendy haircuts and short, catchy, fuzzy guitar tunes? Of course, when those tunes are this instantly infectious. Rough Trade took one listen to their demo, then one look at a gig, and signed them on the spot. The band say they're on their \"dream label\"; the label hope the band will follow in the footsteps of previous Minneapolis exports Prince, the Replacements and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. Ah, they've arrived fully formed from Minneapolis, then, not Mars? Yes, and frontman Jordan Gatesmith has already fooled around in bands such as Total Babe, A-Cups and, er, Gay Animals. But the blogosphere has already gone mad for Howler's tracks posted online, and when they tour with the Vaccines later this year, there may well be a dash to see which of the two bands can pack their time on stage with the most fizzy, catchy tunes. Where can I hear them? Surf over to myspace.com/howlerjams to tide you over until their five-song EP, This One's Different, is released by Rough Trade on 20 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
