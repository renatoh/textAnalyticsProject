The tremendous efforts of Osman's friends to support him only serve to highlight the appalling failures of the British state to protect the lives of those who are here seeking refuge. The change of law which forced the charity Refugee and Migrant Justice (RMJ) into administration can be linked quite directly to Osman's suicide. As if the enduring legal limbo into which many thousands of asylum seekers are forced was not enough of a struggle, the dissolution of RMJ has meant up to 10,000 people have lost their legal representation and, for some, their hope. People like Osman often survive on charity donations and food parcels. The squeeze felt by people in Osman's position, from a loss of legal support and a lack of funds, must be unimaginably difficult and yet, to top it all off, they are vilified on a daily basis in parts of the press. If the government is serious about defending the most vulnerable in this time of austerity then it will reconsider the proposed cuts to legal aid that will not only affect destitute asylum seekers but a huge variety of vulnerable people. Matthew Butcher Nottingham Green party \u2022\u2008In the last three years at least 17 other asylum seekers (five of whom were Iraqi) have, according to our research, taken their own lives as a result of harsh asylum policies in the UK. Most were destitute after support had been withdrawn and facing deportation to countries where they feared for their safety. They \"chose\", like Osman Rasul, to decide when and how they would die. What an indictment of society. Harmit Athwal Institute of Race Relations"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
