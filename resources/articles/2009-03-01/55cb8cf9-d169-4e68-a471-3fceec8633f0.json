Ferguson was outraged by the Liverpool manager's comments, made in the wake of their 4\u20131 victory at Old Trafford, that Manchester United still commanded a huge financial advantage. And in a new twist to their ongoing feud, the United manager accused his rival of not doing things \"correctly\". Ben\u00edtez had said: \"The difference between us is maybe \u00a3100m spent on players and a big stadium.\" Ferguson responded: \"The amazing fact about them is that they have used 60 players in the reserves this season. We have signed 18 players in the last five years but eight of them are young and there is a balance about us. We do things correctly. \"We like to develop our young players but other clubs are maybe different. Rafa has a different philosophy from me about producing players but that is the great thing about football: everyone has a different way of doing things. \"You will see Rafa produce an incredible spending spree \u2013 that is an absolute certainty now he has signed his new contract. They talk of a recession but there will not be one at Liverpool. There will be a spending splurge at Liverpool, that is his [Ben\u00edtez's] way.\" Indicative of the deepening rift between the two managers, Ben\u00edtez used last week's victory at Old Trafford to take another shot at United, who are four points clear with a game in hand, saying: \"There is a massive difference in terms of the two clubs and their squads, players, transfer records and wages.\" Ferguson was so angered by these comments that he asked for a survey on the two clubs' spending patterns since Ben\u00edtez took over at Anfield in the summer of 2004. \"I was amazed when I saw his claims,\" Ferguson said. \"I talked to some people in the sports technology department and said: 'check that out'. I am sure I had not spent that much money. I worked out that in the last five years Liverpool had spent \u00a324m more than Manchester United.\" In this, Ferguson is right up to a point. Under Ben\u00edtez, Liverpool have spent \u00a3191.9m, while Manchester United have spent \u00a3172.25m in the same period. However, these are gross figures and, when sales are taken into account, Ferguson and Ben\u00edtez have net spends around the mid-\u00a380m mark. Exact figures are problematic because some transfer fees are undisclosed. Ben\u00edtez curtly told reporters to \"check the figures\" when informed of Ferguson's comments, adding: \"It doesn't matter what Ferguson says, they still have more money than us.\" In terms of revenue, United's lead is marked. Last season the champions turned over \u00a3257m \u2013 not including their shirt deal with Nike \u2013 a lead over Liverpool of \u00a390m. However, the spending patterns are very different. Ben\u00edtez has spent his money on 34 players, while in that time Ferguson has paid for half that number, at generally higher fees. Ben\u00edtez has broken the \u00a315m barrier three times \u2013 for Fernando Torres, Javier Mascherano and Robbie Keane. Manchester United have had six deals of \u00a315m or more in that time. Ferguson, however, contrasted United's record at developing their own players with Liverpool, whose academy at Kirkby has not produced a young player of note since Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher broke through in the late 1990s. Ferguson remarked that Manchester United were well able to withstand any increased spending coming from Anfield, just as they would ride out the impact of last Saturday's crushing 4\u20131 defeat. \"We don't always succeed \u2013 we had our blips a few years ago when we were rebuilding and people told me it was the end of everything and my shelf life was up. But we came through.\" Ferguson might still view Liverpool as his greatest rival for the Premier League title, but the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, believes Chelsea could be the ones to take advantage of United's weary legs in the final few months of the season. \"I think it is interesting,\" Wenger said. \"I watched a big part of the Manchester United-Liverpool game. For me, United were the dominant team but I could see they were not sharp on the day physically, and Liverpool took advantage of that, because they are very good at doing that. \"Now can you ask if Man United are going to be a little bit jaded physically for a longer period or was it just on the day? If it is for a longer period it can be open. If it was just on the day where they were a little bit tired, which I can understand, they will still win the championship easily.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
