His warning came as Pacific and Indian ocean states warned they faced annihilation if a global climate \u201crule book\u201d could not brokered. In a bruising speech before ministers and heads of state, Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, singled out the US as he excoriated major CO2-emitting developed countries for deliberately hindering negotiations. \u201cIt pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate-induced tragedies, while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris guidelines and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity\u2019s most existential threat,\u201d he said. Regenvanu said the countries most responsible for climate change were now frustrating efforts to counter it. The UN\u2019s climate change talks in Poland have been distracted by a semantic debate over whether the conference should \u201cwelcome\u201d or \u201cnote\u201d the IPCC\u2019s special report warning of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with a bloc of four oil-producing countries \u2013 the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait \u2013 insisting the report be only \u201cnoted\u201d. Documents from the conference presidency, seen by the Guardian, indicate the issue of how to acknowledge the report will be returned to later in the week and is likely to further slow progress on negotiating a final outcome. Negotiators said they are growing increasingly pessimistic that talks can be concluded by their deadline on Friday. \u201cWhether you welcome, or note, or shamefully ignore the science altogether,\u201d Regenvanu said, \u201cthe fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity, and party negotiators blocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience.\u201d He said climate change represented an existential threat to humanity, but \u201cwe have overcome greater human-induced wrongs before like colonialism, like slavery\u201d. As 193 countries at the climate talks seek to establish a \u201crule book\u201d on how to implement the commitments made in the Paris agreement three years ago, Regenvanu condemned a two-tier system that exempted high-emissions countries from reductions obligations, saying the world needed \u201cone common rule book, in which rules apply to all\u201d. The US state department declined to comment on his remarks. Regenvanu was part of a cohort of small island states in the Pacific and Indian oceans that urged greater global action on limiting global warming to 1.5C; leaders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and the Maldives argued their countries faced an impending existential threat from climate change. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Maldives\u2019 environment minister, Hussain Rasheed Hassan, said the world needed to question \u201cwhy we are continuing failing?\u201d. He said: \u201cAfter a quarter of a century of UNFCCC negotiations and three years since the historic Paris agreement, we are further from approaching our goal of stabilising emissions than ever, and \u2026 rapidly approaching the point of no return. The prime minister of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, said the countries that had contributed least to climate change were feeling its impacts first \u2013 and most acutely: \u201cTruly, but sadly, the prosperity enjoyed by a few developed countries, has become the tragedy and misery of the mess of developing countries and particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.\u201d Henry Puna, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said while the Paris agreement represented a moment of global solidarity, inaction and infighting since then had paralysed efforts to reduce emissions. \u201cI am scared for my children\u2019s future, and for the future of generations to come,\u201d he said. \u201cParties have called for action, but it is evident our current efforts are not enough.\u201d He said climate change denialism jeopardised the future of Pacific countries: \u201cSome are not willing to accept the stark realities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
