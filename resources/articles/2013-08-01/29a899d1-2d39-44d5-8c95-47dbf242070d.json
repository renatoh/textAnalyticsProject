The foreign secretary, William Hague, also rang Gibraltar's first minister, Fabian Picardo, to promise that Britain would stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the people of the territory. The potentially dangerous row has been simmering for weeks, with the Spanish imposing lengthy delays on the border crossing and accusing the British of interfering in sovereign waters. The immediate row developed when boats from Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks into the sea to create a reef for fish at the mouth of the Mediterranean. Spain said the reef would block its fishing boats. The Spanish claim a charge on vehicles crossing the border could be used to compensate Spanish fisherman who have lost out because of the new reef. Spain has imposed fresh delays at the border, forcing motorists to queue for over an hour with customs officers requesting each driver to open their boot for a cursory check. \"I want to see a solution as soon as possible because this is beyond a joke,\" said Ron Keenan, a Gibraltarian worker queuing to return home in stifling heat. \"This is worse than it has ever been. Last weekend the queue was six to seven hours.\" Feelings are running high in the British overseas territory where the authorities have accused Madrid of using the border as a political weapon. One government official complained of Spain's \"in your face tactics\". Referring to the Spanish fishing in Gibraltar's waters , he added: \"How would the Brits respond if the French fished in Dover harbour?\" \"Spain is being a bully,\" said Regina, another driver in the queue. \"The people on either side of this border get on but this is just politics that comes from Madrid.\" Howard Brereton, a local radio DJ who has tracked the dispute, said it has meant trouble for over 6,000 Spanish workers who travel to the Rock for work, as much as the Gibraltarians. \"It is a very poor area of Spain and Gibraltar is a wealth pot for the people who live here in the region,\" he said. The British government sought to lower the temperature, saying it would respond to actions not rhetoric, but Picardo strongly defended his claim that Spanish ministers were behaving like a mixture between General Franco and a North Korean dictator. He rounded on the Spanish foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo, after he warned on Sunday of plans to impose \u20ac50 (\u00a343) border fees, close airspace and interfere with Gibraltar's profitable online gambling industry. Margallo declared: \"The party is over.\" Picardo said: \" I have no regrets comparing Margallo to Franco. Everything he threatens to do Franco did in the 1960s. I think the comparison is entirely appropriate. \"As for comparing Spain to North Korea, North Korea has a reputation for making leftfield comments, and that's just how I see what Margallo said. \"It's not about fish, it's about sovereignty. The Spanish have always claimed rights to Gibraltar's waters that they don't have.\" He added that Britain had known how to defend the Falklands, and would know, if necessary, how to defend the people of Gibraltar. There is some doubt whether the Spanish would be legally entitled to impose border fees, since it might be in breach of the EU's principles of the free movement of workers. But the European commission said fees would be lawful so long as they were proportionate. With Conservative MPs demanding a firm response, Hague said he had emphasised to Picardo that \"we will respect Gibraltar's 2006 constitution and the commitments the UK has repeatedly made not to compromise on British sovereignty over Gibraltar\". He also called on Spain to respect previous agreements signed at C\u00f3rdoba in 2006 and to do everything possible not to escalate the tensions. The C\u00f3rdoba agreement included deals on issues such as border crossings and access for flights, as well as establishing a tripartite forum for regular dialogue between Britain, Spain and Gibraltar. Last Friday the Foreign Office's political director, Simon Gass, summoned the Spanish ambassador to the UK, Federico Trillo, in order to respond to anger about the delays at the Gibraltar-Spain border. But the summons appears only to have antagonised Garc\u00eda-Margallo to lengthen the border checks, which sometimes last five hours in the searing summer heat. Picardo said: \"Gibraltar has always been a convenient smokescreen for Spanish governments of whatever party when they need a distraction, especially now with the B\u00e1rcenas corruption story.\" Luis B\u00e1rcenas, the former treasurer of the ruling Popular party (PP) has been accused of providing secret illegal cash payments to political figures including Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. The British diplomatic calculation now turns on whether the foreign minister is truly speaking on behalf of the Spanish government, or has instead tried to play a rhetorical game to please an increasingly restive Spanish press. \"It could be a passing summer storm, or a harbinger of a real deterioration in relations,\" said one diplomatic source. Gibraltar has been a British territory since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
