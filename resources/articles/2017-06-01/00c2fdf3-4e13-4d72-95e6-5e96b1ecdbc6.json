Donald Trump is expected to travel to Miami on Friday to announce reversals to elements of Barack Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, which saw embassies reopen, direct flights resume and companies do business after half a century of cold war hostility. Addressing the Senate foreign relations committee in Washington on Tuesday, Tillerson testified that Obama\u2019s reforms effectively removed pressure on Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s regime to alter its behaviour. \u201cCuba has failed to improve its own human rights record, political opponents continue to be imprisoned, dissidents continue to be jailed, women continue to be harassed. \u201cSo what we have to achieve in approaching Cuba is, if we\u2019re going to sustain the sunny side of this relationship, Cuba must \u2013 absolutely must \u2013 begin to address its human rights challenges.\u201d An interagency review of Cuba policy was still under way on Tuesday but Tillerson\u2019s remarks gave the strongest clue yet as to the intentions of Trump, who has the power to undo Obama\u2019s executive actions. On Friday the president is likely to rally hardline members of Miami\u2019s Cuban exile community while potentially delivering a setback to the activities of Airbnb, Google and other companies doing business on the island. Fifty-five Cuban female entrepreneurs have sent joint a letter to the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, asking for her support for policies they say have empowered Cuban women and their families across the island. But Tillerson said the Trump administration believes that the new US approach is directly supporting the Cuban government in violation of American law. \u201cWe would love to keep the sunny side, we\u2019d love to keep it in compliance with existing statues that doesn\u2019t lead to financial support for what we can only describe continues to be a very oppressive regime.\u201d The administration wants to restore the intent of legislation designed to put pressure on the regime to change, he added. \u201cThat pressure\u2019s been, in our view, largely removed now.\u201d Trump is expected to retain some reforms and shelve others. The US embassy in Havana will remain open but trade with any Cuban entity linked to the military will be banned, according to a White House official who spoke to the Associated Press. There will also be a cut in the number of categories for which Americans do not need US government licenses to go to Cuba, the Associated Press reported, and the US will demand greater internet access and the release of prisoners and return of American fugitives in Cuba. Obama\u2019s repeal of the special Cuban immigration privileges, known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d, is not expected to change. At Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, Tillerson also testified that the US relationship with Russia is at \u201can all-time low\u201d and deteriorating further, but he warned against closing off promising avenues of communication. He told the committee that he is still reviewing a new package of Russia sanctions the Senate is considering in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and its aggression in other parts of the world, including Syria and Ukraine. At what was ostensibly a budget hearing, the secretary of state was also forced to defend the Trump administration\u2019s plans for cuts of nearly $19bn, or 32%, in the diplomatic and foreign aid allocations. He expected to have a plan for reorganising the state department at the end of the year. The former ExxonMobil chief executive said: \u201cOur budget will never determine our ability to be effective. Our people will.\u201d But Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the committee, launched a withering assault on the Trump presidency as a threat to American leadership in the world. \u201cMy concern today, quite frankly, is that your administration will go down in the history books as being \u2018present at the destruction\u2019 of that order we have worked so hard to support \u2013 and that has so benefitted our security and prosperity and ideals,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
