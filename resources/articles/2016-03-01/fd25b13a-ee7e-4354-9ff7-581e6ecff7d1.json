The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) agency \u2013 which shuttles more than 420,000 customers per weekday in San Francisco and surrounding California cities and suburbs \u2013 is considering a new rule that would formally ban riders from spreading into multiple train seats, with an offense punishable by a fine of up to $500. The controversial proposal comes as mass transit systems in dense urban centers in the US and across the globe have been forced to grapple with huge growths in ridership, which can lead to severe crowding on train cars and buses and can make poor etiquette by riders particularly bothersome. Social media shaming has also increasingly shined a light on offensive habits, with commuters publishing photos of seat hoggers and \u201cmanspreaders\u201d, referring to men \u2013 and women \u2013 who spread their legs wide enough to take up more than one seat. While San Francisco\u2019s transportation officials are considering a uniquely aggressive tactic \u2013 $100 for the first violation, $200 for a second and $500 for each additional offense \u2013 many other large transit systems have opted to raise awareness through marketing campaigns that are often humorous. New York City\u2019s metropolitan transit agency made headlines when it unveiled subway posters that said, \u201cDude \u2026 Stop The Spread, Please\u201d, and Seattle, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and other cities\u2019 transportation systems have rolled out various signs and slogans that remind riders to limit themselves to one seat. Online public shaming has also broken out in London, Toronto, Istanbul and beyond. \u201cWe feel like this has been an effective way for us to get the word out on what good manners are in transit,\u201d said Bruce Gray, spokesman for Sound Transit, a transportation agency in Seattle that used a cartoon octopus to remind riders of the \u201cone body, one seat\u201d principle. \u201cWhether or not people who are the worst offenders are actually seeing this stuff, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Joel Keller, a Bart director, said he was not aware of other transit systems that had specifically used citations and fines to fight seat hogging, though he emphasized that he expects Bart police would use this punishment as a last resort. The ordinance also contains exceptions for \u201cmedical ailments and large body types\u201d and would only apply when a passenger using more than one seat is blocking other patrons from sitting. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for ... troopers going in there looking for violations,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI would hope it would start and end with the warning.\u201d Transportation officials and riders agree that the Bart system \u2013 which has grown by more than 100,000 weekday riders over the past five years \u2013 has major capacity problems, especially during rush hour when trains can be so crowded that passengers sometimes have to let trains pass before they can squeeze in. But not everyone agrees that a new rule and steep fines would be an effective tool to help alleviate the pains of congestion. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it\u2019s too broad and the penalties are too high, particularly since the people who this will affect the most are homeless people sleeping on the train and also people who are traveling from out of the area and don\u2019t know the rules,\u201d said Rebecca Saltzman, another Bart director who said she won\u2019t vote for the ordinance in its current form. In the past, Bart has also faced accusations that riders use its customer complaint system to racially profile black passengers and to unfairly target the homeless \u2013 a problem that some worry could escalate with a new law. \u201cIt\u2019d be extremely mean for homeless people \u2013 they don\u2019t have money and they don\u2019t have anywhere to live,\u201d said Anita Smith, a 56-year-old Bart rider who lives in Oakland. \u201cIt\u2019s a little severe.\u201d Jordan Bruno, 24, said that when he asks a Bart seat hogger to make room for him, he never has a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we have to resort to fines to enforce what should be decent human behavior.\u201d Ivy Tullis, a 33-year-old passenger who commutes from the suburb of Pittsburg to San Francisco, said seat hogging is a major problem. \u201cPeople have actually gotten into arguments and gotten pretty aggressive about sharing seats,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
