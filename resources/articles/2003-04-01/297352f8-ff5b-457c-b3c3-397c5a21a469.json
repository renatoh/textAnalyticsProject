The Manchester United manager was notified at the team hotel here yesterday that he has been charged with bringing the game into disrepute for suggesting there was a conspiracy to prevent United reaching the final at Old Trafford. He had said: \"It was a nice draw for the Spanish and Italians. I think they picked it themselves. The three Italian teams have avoided each other and so have the three Spanish. \"How do you think that worked out? I can tell you - Uefa don't want us in the final, that's for sure. I don't know why they have given the final to Old Trafford because they don't want us to get there.\" Perhaps realising the extent of anger his allegations had caused, Ferguson withdrew them on Monday, admitting he had been \"wrong\" and that he had been assured \"the draw was fair\". But his rare apology is unlikely to spare him from a hefty fine when Uefa's disciplinary committee meets on May 1. \"With his remarks Sir Alex cast doubt upon the integrity of the draw for the quarter- finals,\" a Uefa spokesman said yesterday. Ferguson \"had a duty to \"conduct himself according to the principle of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". Ferguson's remarks have also caused intense embarrassment at Old Trafford at a time when the club's chief executive Peter Kenyon has been liaising closely with Uefa to prepare for the May 28 final. The irritation of Kenyon and his fellow directors is hardly likely to be eased by the knowledge that Ferguson will almost certainly want the club to pay any fine for him. Kenyon remains publicly supportive. He tried to pass off the manager's remarks yesterday as a reaction to stress. \"When you look at this period, with games against Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle and Arsenal, such is the tension, this is all part of the build-up,\" he said. This will be the second time Uefa has taken action against Ferguson. In 1999 he was fined \u00a32,000 before the Champions League quarter-finals because of remarks about Italians and Internazionale. United have asked permission to talk to a United States international goalkeeper, Tim Howard, about a move to Old Trafford, according to his club. \"United have shown an interest and he's quite a goalkeeper,\" said Nick Sakiewicz, general manager of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
