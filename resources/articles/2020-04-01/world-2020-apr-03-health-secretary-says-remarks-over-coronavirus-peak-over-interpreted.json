Matt Hancock began his media appearances on Friday by saying it was \u201cperfectly possible\u201d the peak of the disease could arrive in nine days\u2019 time. His comment led to confusion hours later at the daily Downing Street press conference as the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, asked when the epidemic was expected to peak, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201d Van-Tam said it was \u201ctoo soon to say\u201d when the peak would hit, appearing to contradict the health secretary. \u201cIt will partly depend upon how well those social distancing measures are adhered to by every one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it will be soon. We\u2019re going to watch very carefully to see when we\u2019ve hit the peak and when we\u2019re starting to turn it, but we will not take any premature actions.\u201d Easter Sunday falls on 12 April this year, and Hancock had earlier said he would not steer people away from anticipating that date as the peak in the number of fatalities in the UK, though there was still uncertainty around it. He clarified his remarks during the Downing Street press conference on Friday evening after being asked again by Sky News when he thought the peak would fall. \u201cThe truth is that we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. He claimed his remarks had been over interpreted and he had been clear that the government could not give a definitive answer in his earlier interviews. He said: \u201cActually, there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s because it depends on how people act, and this is why the absolute central message, the most important message that anybody can take away from this press conference or the entirety of the government\u2019s messaging and how we feel, is that you\u2019ve got to stay at home.\u201d The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said Hancock\u2019s 12 April suggestion did not feel accurate considering the evidence she had assessed. She said: \u201cI want to be very clear that nothing I have seen gives me any basis whatsoever for predicting the virus will peak as early as a week\u2019s time here in Scotland.\u201d Her chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, stressed: \u201cI have not been able to find that the peak will be as soon as we\u2019re hearing in the media today. Now is not the time to think that perhaps it will all be over soon.\u201d Several government ministers have come under fire for giving mixed messages to the public, including the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who incorrectly said people should only go shopping for food once a week, which was later corrected by No 10. Michael Gove also stepped in to explain that daily exercise should be a walk or run close to home after people had interpreted the government\u2019s rule as allowing them to travel further afield. The prime minister has also been criticised for talking about plans for up to 250,000 tests a day. The health secretary confirmed the immediate aim was 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
