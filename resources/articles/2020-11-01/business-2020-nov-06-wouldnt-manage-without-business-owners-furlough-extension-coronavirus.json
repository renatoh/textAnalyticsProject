Businesses will now be able to furlough staff on 80% of their salaries until March next year. The Guardian spoke to small business owners about what it means for them. Hayley Mountjoy-Hicks, beauty salon owner, Gloucestershire \u2018We wouldn\u2019t manage without it\u2019 For 35-year-old Hayley Mountjoy-Hicks, the announcement of a second lockdown in England was devastating. \u201cThis year has been so difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such high overheads with rent, and I haven\u2019t been earning any income at all. We\u2019ve had to buy PPE, and constant cleaning in the salon has meant we need more time between appointments, so we\u2019ve missed out on clients. If it goes on for much longer, it\u2019s very worrying for the survival of the business.\u201d Mountjoy-Hicks furloughed her apprentice, her only employee, at her salon in Tetbury during the first national lockdown, and did the same again on Thursday. She welcomed the chancellor\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely necessary especially if we\u2019re not allowed to open on 2 December,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t manage without it.\u201d Nicola Ferjani, soft play centre owner, Southampton \u2018I\u2019m grateful for the support\u2019 \u201cThe announcement about furlough was certainly helpful, but also shows me that this is going to go on for a lot longer than I was anticipating, so in some ways it\u2019s a bit of a blow,\u201d said Nicola Ferjani, 46, who owns a soft play centre in Southampton. She furloughed all 10 of her employees during the last lockdown and will do the same during the second. Ferjani said the lockdown was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d for her business, describing it as an \u201cabyss\u201d. \u201cWe were running on a deficit after the last lockdown, and when we reopened on 16 August we were only at 30% capacity because of social distancing, so we weren\u2019t even breaking even,\u201d she said. \u201cPlay centres are very seasonal because more people play outside in the summer, so we generate money through the winter to see us through but we\u2019re now not able to do that. \u201cWe did have preliminary conversations about redundancies, but you have to be able to afford redundancies,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to ride it out until the pot goes dry.\u201d Andrew McAllister, swim coaching business owner, Manchester and London \u2018My team could be getting 50% of what they now earn\u2019 Andrew McAllister has been forced to make five redundancies during the pandemic from his business, and has furloughed his remaining 10 staff. While he praised the scheme for helping him to maintain most of his staff, McAllister, who is 34, raised concerns about the calculation for the 80% of wages the government will pay. \u201cMany of my staff members started in January, and we have a long training process, during which they\u2019re paid a slightly lower wage,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the last lockdown, the furlough scheme was based on their wages during that period, but since we reopened over the summer they\u2019ve earned good money with us coaching lessons. If the furlough scheme doesn\u2019t account for that, they\u2019ll be earning about 50% of what they have been paid over the past three months.\u201d McAllister said that closure during a second lockdown was \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d. He\u2019d be planning to extend his business to two new locations this week in the south of England. \u201cI am hugely concerned that the longer the delay in reopening, the greater the chance some swimming pools may never reopen.\u201d Malik Aslan, Vape shop owner, Watford and High Wycombe \u2018We used to have a turnover of around \u00a315,000 per month in each shop, and that\u2019s dropped to five or six thousand\u2019 Malik Aslan, who runs two vape shops in the Hertfordshire town of Watford and High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, \u201csomehow survived\u201d the first lockdown, but was forced to pour his savings into the business. He received a government grant of \u00a310,000 and furloughed his four employees, but said this didn\u2019t make up the lost income. During the last lockdown, 37-year-old Aslan paid for 20% of his employees\u2019 salaries on top of the furlough scheme, but said he can\u2019t afford to do the same this time around. \u201cWe used to have a turnover of around \u00a315,000 per month in each shop, and that\u2019s dropped to five or six thousand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard at the moment.\u201d Without the furlough scheme, Aslan said he would not have been able to keep his staff on, and that the extension would help. Martin Jones, bar owner, Cardiff \u2018We\u2019ve been forgotten\u2019 For some businesses, however, Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t change anything. Martin Jones, 52, owns the Main Stage bar in Cardiff\u2019s city centre. He took over the bar from its previous owner in July, making him ineligible for the furlough scheme, despite the bar existing for many years before. \u201cThe bar used to employ 12 staff, but when we took it over we had to lay off all but five, including myself. I\u2019m worried for my staff. They have rent and bills to pay.\u201d The two-week \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d lockdown in Wales, which began on 23 October, forced the bar to close, and while it is due to reopen on Monday, it must shut at 10pm. Also, only four people are allowed per table, unlike the six allowed in England. Jones said he expects further lockdown measures. \u201cBefore we took over, the bar would take between \u00a310,000 and \u00a312,000 a week during the summer, but with the 10pm curfew we\u2019re struggling to take \u00a32,500,\u201d he said. \u201cIt covers the cost of buying in beer and wages, and just about pays a couple of bills, but not all of them. \u201cI\u2019m not worried abut making profits, I just want to survive. I want to come out of this and still have a business, and for staff to still have a job. To me, it\u2019s a very unfair system. We\u2019ve been left behind and forgotten about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
