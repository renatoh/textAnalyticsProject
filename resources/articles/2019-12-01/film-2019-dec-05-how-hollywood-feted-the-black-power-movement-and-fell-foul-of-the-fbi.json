The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA BBS Productions). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider. Now they were attempting to do to American life what they had done to Hollywood: brazenly tear up the rulebook and redistribute power. The producers had clandestinely shuttled Newton to Mexico, then convinced a Colombian smuggler \u2013 known only as \u201cthe Pirate\u201d \u2013 to take the black radical, who was on the run after being accused of shooting a 17-year-old sex worker, into Cuban waters. But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn\u2019t the hero\u2019s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS\u2019s most audacious production. It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers. In the late 60s and early 70s, dozens of actors, producers and directors would flirt with the revolutionary group \u2013 funding them, championing them and chronicling their rise and fall. The story of Newton and Schneider\u2019s shambolic but ultimately successful bromance is on its way to becoming a TV series in the US with the original magazine story written by Joshuah Bearman \u2013 the same journalist who recounted the real-life storytale that became the Oscar winner Argo \u2013 being adapted into a limited series. Meanwhile, Seberg \u2013 the Jean Seberg biopic starring Kristen Stewart as the American starlet \u2013 is released in the UK next month. It tells the story of the star who was plucked out of obscurity in Marshalltown, Iowa after a talent search and became a darling of the French New Wave \u2013 starring in Otto Preminger\u2019s Saint Joan in 1957 and then Jean Luc-Godard\u2019s Breathless in 1960. Seberg\u2019s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI. In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship \u2013 the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic \u2013 with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles. After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal\u2019s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who \u2013 before she became infamous after raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970 \u2013 donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg\u2019s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her \u201ca social nuisance\u201d in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn\u2019s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O\u2019Connell. They are told they must carry on hounding the actor because the orders come \u201cstraight from the top\u201d \u2013 meaning Hoover, who would sign off on the release of information to a gossip column in Hollywood that indicated that Seberg was pregnant with Jamal\u2019s child. It was a lie \u2013 she had in fact got pregnant after a fling with a young Mexican actor \u2013 but it spread before she\u2019d had a chance to explain the situation to her French husband, Romain Gary, driving a wedge between them. Seberg had a miscarriage in 1970 \u2013 the stress and paranoia that she endured having possibly contributed to it \u2013 and a mental breakdown. In a 1974 interview with the New York Times, Seberg discussed leaving the world of the black radicals behind \u2013 not because of the FBI intimidation, but because she felt her breakdown had made her a burden. \u201cI\u2019ve analysed the fact that I\u2019m not equipped to participate absolutely and totally,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a very, very bad mental breakdown, and now I realise I wouldn\u2019t want a person like me in a group I was a member of, as Groucho Marx would put it.\u201d She also discussed returning home with her dead baby to prove the child\u2019s ethnicity. \u201cWe opened the coffin and took 180 photographs, and everybody in Marshalltown who was curious what colour the baby was got a chance to check it out,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them came to look.\u201d Seberg remained in Paris where her mental health problems continued. At 40 she was found dead in her car, after an apparent suicide. The Seberg case showed the lengths the FBI would go to in order to sabotage those associated with the Panthers, but it also highlighted the pull of the group. New Hollywood stars didn\u2019t have to go as far as Seberg; they could conveniently and safely tap into the group\u2019s energy at fundraisers in Beverly Hills mansions and New York townhouses. Seberg was inspired to start acting after she saw Marlon Brando in The Men in 1950, and 18 years later the pair would be two of the Black Panthers\u2019 most vocal Hollywood supporters. Brando was a boost for the Panthers because he raised their profile, but he was also a way to financially prop up an organisation that was constantly having to find bail money and needed cash to support a rapidly expanding operation. A donor to the Panthers\u2019 cause, Brando gave the eulogy at the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a teenage Panther who was killed in April 1968 by the Oakland police while trying to surrender. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up and make a speech because you\u2019ve been listening to white people for 400 years,\u201d he said, before duly going on to give a speech in which he decried living standards for black Americans. After a fundraiser thrown by Shirley Douglas, then married to Donald Sutherland, senior Panther Bobby Seale reportedly said: \u201cWe took Marlon Brando for $10,000, we can take Jean Seberg for $20,000.\u201d They would get a lot more from the New Hollywood cohort. The list of celebrity donors to the group reads like a who\u2019s who of New (and old) Hollywood. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton signed cheques. Fonda solicited for donations to the Panthers at Taylor\u2019s Oscars party in 1970. Mia Farrow, Shirley MacLaine and Barbra Streisand all contributed. But the relationship was not a one-way street: the group found inspiration from the new breed of risk-taking film-makers. As Newton became more unpredictable and isolated as the Panthers\u2019 leader, he turned to The Godfather and would extol \u201cits protagonists\u2019 machiavellian cunning and ruthlessness\u201d. Newton also loved Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song \u2013 Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s groundbreaking 1971 film about a hustler who becomes a revolutionary and runs away to Mexico \u2013 which had more than a slight resemblance to his own story. Such fandom translated into real-life attempts at film-making. Richard Pryor was a close friend of Newton and was working on a screenplay about the Black Panther leaders\u2019 life at Schneider\u2019s LA home when an accident while freebasing cocaine left him with burns to his face and body; he abruptly kiboshed the project. Seale and Newton were also reportedly working on a blaxploitation screenplay when their relationship broke down and Seale fled Oakland after Newton allegedly had him pistol-whipped. New Hollywood documentaries detailed the Panthers\u2019 rise and contributed to their mystique. Howard Alk\u2019s American Revolution 2 follows the Panthers after the unrest at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as its leadership attempts to form an alliance with poor, disenfranchised whites. Alk\u2019s The Murder of Fred Hampton serves as an \u201cexpos\u00e9 of state-sponsored anti-black terror\u201d, with the documentary maker attempting to reveal the extent of the FBI\u2019s involvement in the young, charismatic leader\u2019s death. David Weiss\u2019s No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger makes the link between the black liberation and anti-war movements, while documenting the anti-Vietnam-war march on the United Nations in 1967. Perhaps the most potent Panthers documentary is Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s 27-minute portrait, which captures the energy of the nascent movement in Oakland during the summer of 1968. Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver articulately unpack the Panthers\u2019 Marxist ideology, while other female Panthers explain the importance of wearing their hair naturally. Fifty years later, it still feels radical and Karina Longworth, host of You Must Remember This \u2013 who dedicated an exhaustive and excellent eight-episode run of her podcast to the story of Jane Fonda, Seberg and their relationship to black radical groups \u2013 believes Varda\u2019s film represents the kind of romantic view of the group that Seberg and the New Hollywood supporters may have shared. Other films tapped into the comic potential of the Panthers, none more so than Robert Downey Snr\u2019s innovative Putney Swope. Made in 1969, the same year Easy Rider ushered in the new wave of US film-making, it\u2019s the story of a token black executive at a Madison Avenue ad agency \u2013 played by Arnold Johnson with his voice dubbed by the director \u2013 who accidentally becomes chairman and then replaces all the white employees with black revolutionaries. Advocates of the film include Paul Thomas Anderson, Louis CK and Boots Riley, who took the voice-dubbing concept to an even more surreal level in his 2017 satire Sorry to Bother You. So what became of Newton after his daring sea crossing? He was eventually released by the Cuban authorities and briefly settled down into a life of sugar-cane farming and motor repairs. At the same time, BBS Productions ran out of steam in a Hollywood that had shifted from late-60s optimism and invention into the late-70s blockbuster era. Newton\u2019s caper was effectively BBS\u2019s last act. But Schneider would have another revolutionary moment, when he appeared on stage at the 1975 Academy Awards to accept his award for best documentary for his anti-Vietnam-war doc Hearts and Minds. He offered \u201cgreetings of friendship to all the American people\u201d from the North Vietnamese government, while dressed in a white tuxedo. Meanwhile, Jane Fonda continued to promote revolutionary politics, and the 1979 Academy Awards would become known as the \u201cVietnam Oscars\u201d because of the political tensions over two New Hollywood anti-war movies, Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. It is easy to mock the radical affiliations of Brando, Schneider and Fonda as contrived bandwagon jumping. But in the 70s they risked their careers and, in the case of Seberg, destroyed them in order to support a cause. In our age of ephemeral hashtag activism, when stars can send a tweet about an issue and be celebrated for it, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate their radical chic. \u2022 Seberg is released on 10 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
