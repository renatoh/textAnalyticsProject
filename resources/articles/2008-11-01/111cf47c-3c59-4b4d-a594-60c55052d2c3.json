The decision followed months of difficult negotiations and, pending parliamentary approval, will remove a major point of contention between the two allies. A government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said all but one of the 28 cabinet ministers present at today's meeting, in addition to the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, voted in favour of the pact by a show of hands. The cabinet has 37 members and it was not immediately clear why some ministers were not present. Several of them were believed to be abroad. \"This is an important and positive step,\" said a US embassy spokesman, Adam Ereli. Dabbagh said the agreement would be submitted to parliament later today, but did not say when the 275-member legislature will vote on the document. Parliament is scheduled to go into recess at the end of the month or in early December because of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, when scores of lawmakers travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the annual pilgrimage. Dabbagh said he was \"optimistic\" the deal would be passed by parliament, but added: \"You cannot guarantee 100 percent the approval of anything.\" Iran has bitterly opposed the pact on grounds that it enshrines the US military presence in Iraq and threatens its security and regional influence. Nonetheless, Iranian state television today described the deal as \"a victory for the al-Maliki government, which was able to apply its own viewpoints\". Followers of Iraq's Shia leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, have objected to the pact. \"This agreement hands Iraq over (to the US) on a golden platter and for an indefinite period,\" said Ahmed al-Massoudi, spokesman for the 30-seat Sadrist bloc in parliament. Sadr, whose militiamen have fought US forces in three uprisings since 2003, has threatened to resume attacks on American troops if they don't immediately begin to withdraw from Iraq. The final draft of the agreement, reached after months of negotiations, is designed to meet Iraqi concerns over its sovereignty and its security needs as it continues to grapple with a diminished but persistent insurgency. It provides for the departure of US forces from Iraq by the end of 2011 and gives Iraq the right to try American soldiers and defence contractors in the case of serious crimes committed off-duty and off-base. It also prohibits the US from using Iraqi territory to attack Iraq's neighbors, like Syria and Iran . Iraqi government supporters of the pact, including Maliki's interior and defence ministers, say a continued US military presence is needed until Iraq's nascent security forces are capable of taking charge of security in the war-devastated nation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
