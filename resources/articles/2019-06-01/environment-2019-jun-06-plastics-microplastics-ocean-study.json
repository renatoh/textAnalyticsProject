Though they lived at average depths of 1,000ft, their stomachs routinely contained bottle caps, trash bags, and light sticks. \u201cIt was so strange,\u201d says Choy, who works at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cWe were seeing recognizable pieces of human society.\u201d Her concerns about plastic pollution inspired a study of waters off the coast of northern California, conducted by Choy and a team of other scientists. The findings, released today in Nature Scientific Reports, reveal a proliferation of microplastic particles, the tiny fragments left over when larger plastics break down. Most remarkably, the highest concentrations of microplastics were found about 200-300 meters (650-1,000ft) down \u2013 four times more plastic than was found in samples at the surface. That\u2019s on par, or higher, with quantities found at the surface of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The study was done in Monterey Bay, a marine sanctuary and haven for sea life including whales, otters and sharks. \u201cWe did not expect to find this much pollution at these depths,\u201d says Kyle Van Houtan, chief scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, who co-authored the new paper. The implication: microplastics could be widespread \u2013 even concentrated \u2013 in the deep ocean around the world. \u201cThis is making us realize that the problem is far more extensive than we thought, and not constrained to the surface of the ocean.\u201d Microplastic pollution has been found on almost every part of the planet, but the scientists say this is the first rigorous study of microplastics distribution at varying ocean depths. Plastic was thought to stick to the surface; Choy wanted to examine everything from the surface to the ocean floor (known as the \u201cwater column\u201d) and see how the concentration of plastic changed as animals traveled up and down. Scientists carried out their research using unmanned submarines, and sampled water at two locations and at depths ranging from five to 1,000 meters. They also sampled two marine species \u2013 pelagic red crabs and giant larvaceans (tadpole-like creatures) \u2013 both of which are filter-feeders that move from the surface to the deep on a daily migration. Microplastics were present in all the specimens\u2019 digestive tracts. Most of it was PET, the type found in single-use bottles and food containers. Reachers also concluded that plastic particles had been in the ocean for a long time, and that the majority came from land sources rather than fishing gear. Small animals such as those sampled, as well as ocean water patterns, may be part of the reason that buoyant plastic is reaching such depths, explains Choy. \u201cThere can be physical mechanisms like vertical mixing, wind, waves and biological mechanisms like an animal eating plastic at the surface and pooping it out at depth.\u201d Meanwhile, the buildup of bacteria or tiny creatures on the plastic itself changes its buoyancy and weighs it down. As animals move up and down, they circulate materials around the ocean. \u201cThe greatest migrations in Earth are not birds to the tropics,\u201d says Van Houtan. \u201cThe largest are the vertical migrations in the ocean, as creatures travel up and down the water column, to the deep and back. That\u2019s why we should be concerned about these findings.\u201d Brendan Godley, who leads the University of Exeter\u2019s marine strategy team, said the study was extremely novel but not entirely surprising. \u201cA few years ago, these findings may have shocked, but scientists are now beginning to realize that microplastics are truly ubiquitous,\u201d says Godley, who was not involved in the research. \u201cMicroplastics have been found from the seafloor to the mountain tops, to the air that we breathe and the salt we put on our meals.\u201d Choy and Van Houtan say that the public perception of the deep ocean as a far-off alien world is at odds with reality and ignores how much human society can affect it. \u201cWe rely on what happens on the deep sea every day,\u201d says Choy. \u201cIt provides a lot of commerce, substance and protein, and it makes us think about how our day-to-day habits and activities impact the deep ocean.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
