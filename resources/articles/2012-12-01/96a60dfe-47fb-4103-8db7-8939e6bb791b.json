You know this one. A sassy free spirit (Anna Kendrick) rocks up to college to help a waspish a cappella group accept their failings, embrace diversity and use what they have learned to take on warbling jocks \"The Treblemakers\" at the regional singing competition. Yet Pitch Perfect goes to ruder, stranger places than Glee would ever dare, shoop-shooping along on a script that's pickle-shot punchy. Kendrick is playful and assured in the lead role, straight-faced enough to let her troupe of kooks (including Bridesmaids' Rebel Wilson \u2013 excellent as bolshy warbler Fat Amy) hit the right notes. The soundtrack's ironic bent might dissuade older viewers (Simple Minds are venerated), but they'd be missing out on one of the best musical comedies since A Mighty Wind. The song's the same, but Pitch Perfect is a great cover version. \u2022 Peter Bradshaw will be taking your calls and donations on Saturday 22 December to raise money for this year's Guardian Christmas appeal. Call 020-3353 4368 between 10am-6pm to speak to Peter and other Guardian and Observer writers and editors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
