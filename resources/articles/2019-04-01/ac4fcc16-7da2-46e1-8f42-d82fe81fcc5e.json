The women and equalities committee accuses the government of failing to tackle challenges identified by a UN committee on women\u2019s rights last year, which found \u201csystematic violations\u201d. Abortion is legal in Northern Ireland only in a narrow set of circumstances, which do not include rape or fatal foetal abnormality. While abortion is a devolved issue, the cross-party assembly at Stormont has been suspended for two years and there are growing calls for the government in Westminster to act. Pressure for reform has intensified since the Irish Republic legalised abortion after a referendum last year. Despite a UK government-backed scheme, announced in 2017, that provides funding for women from Northern Ireland to have abortions in England, the committee found that ambiguities remained about the legal situation. The chief medical officer told MPs he believed it was unclear whether doctors would be fulfilling their legal duties if they made referrals to the scheme. \u201cThe lack of clarity about the current legal situation is creating confusion, fear and inequality,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Maria Miller. \u201cOur report sets out action which the government must take to address this.\u201d In particular, the MPs argue that the director of public prosecutions should clarify the legal situation. The report from the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women highlighted the cases of women who conceived as a result of rape, or whose child was diagnosed with a fatal foetal abnormality. The Westminster committee travelled to Northern Ireland and heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including Dawn Purvis, the former chief executive of the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast, which has closed. She told them about a 12-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape and had to travel to England for an abortion \u2013 accompanied by police who attended in order to seize the \u201cproducts of conception\u201d for evidence. The supreme court was forced to drop a case over the legality of abortion law in Northern Ireland in 2018, because the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which brought the complaint, did not have the legal standing to do so. The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, told the MPs there was an error in the official explanatory memorandum when the Northern Ireland Act came into force which failed to give the commission the appropriate status. Bradley told the committee the government was committed to rectifying the discrepancy as soon as possible, but that this would require legislation. The committee said this should happen \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d and certainly within six months. Campaigners for abortion rights welcomed the report. Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said it was \u201ca welcome and urgent intervention that the UK government cannot ignore\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
