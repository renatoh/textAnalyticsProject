Detectives in Hull are investigating suspicions that a \"noxious substance\" was administered to 79-year-old Kenneth Heaton in the city's Royal Infirmary. Records going back three years have been impounded from the hospital's ward one, a specialist unit for leukaemia, where he died last August. An internal investigation has established that the ward did not have an unusually high death rate over the period, since July 2001, when the nurse was employed. But senior staff called in Humberside police to investigate all cases involving the nurse. The woman is 25 and worked on the ward with 29 colleagues, none of whom is under suspicion. A hotline for concerned patients and relatives has been set up by the trust."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
