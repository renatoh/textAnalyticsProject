Attempting to put memories of his semi-problematic appearance on Jay Leno's Tonight show last week behind him, the president needs to use this much more formal but still somewhat unpredictable Q-and-A format to try to rein in some of the AIG anger, sell his budget and his bank rescue plans, and generally call for everyone to hold their nerves. Judging by the advance text of his opening remarks, we're in for a lot of calls for \"common purpose\" and \"patience\". Will the press take off their gloves? Will Obama convince the populace that bailing out Wall Street again is in everyone's best interests? Will he make a joke at the expense of disabled people, just for the hell of it? Well, no less a source than Rahm Emanuel stuck his head into the White House press room today to declare: \"Tonight's gonna go good!\", and who is more neutral and unbiased than Rahm Emanuel? Nobody, that's who. I'll be liveblogging here in a few minutes, from 8pm eastern time, midnight UK time. Bring your sense of common purpose and join me! 7.50pm (all times eastern): The East Room's already full -- except, of course, for the president. You may picture it in your mind's eye thusly: a big room with cream walls, two ornate chandeliers, a podium, a surprising amount of greenery surrounding the podium, and a large quantity of journalists, muttering. 7.53pm: As I mentioned earlier today, tonight's news conference is messing up the American Idol schedule, a fact that will at least present viewers with an opportunity to practice this \"patience\" thing that the president will be talking about. 8.01pm: ...And here he is, offering an initial \"update\" on the crisis. \"It took many failures to lead us here,\" and it will take plenty of time to lead us out. \"It's a strategy to create jobs, to help responsible homeowners, to re-start lending, and to grow our economy over the long-term. And we are beginning to see signs of progress.\" 8.05pm: This is earnest, decidedly unflashy stuff -- a broad summary of Obama's plans to \"restart the flow of credit to families and businesses\", rescue the banks, and \"to ensure that we do not return to an economic cycle of bubble and bust in this country... The budget I submitted to Congress will build our economic recovery on a stronger foundation, so that we do not face another crisis like this 10 or 20 years from now... in this budget, we have made the tough choices necessary to cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term -- even under the most pessimistic estimates.\" 8.07pm: More budget sales pitch. Obama's budget, he says, is \"what lays the foundation for a secure and lasting prosperity.\" 8.08pm: And so to the topic of anger: Obama was \"as angry as anybody\" about the AIG bonuses, he says, and Wall Street needs to change its ways, radically, but on the other hand, we \"can't afford to demonise\" every investor and entrepreneur. 8.10pm: Jennifer Loven of AP asks why the public should agree to yet more government aid to Wall Street, this time to the banks. Obama's answer recasts the question as a matter of making sure the government has authority over how taxpayers' money's being spent. 8.11pm: NBC's ubiquitous Chuck Todd asks an odd question that starts off focusing on how the wealthy recipients of bailout money have been cushioned from making any real sacrifices, but then veers around to asking why Obama hasn't asked the American people to sacrifice anything specific. \"Folks are sacrificing left and right,\" Obama points out. Across the board, \"people are making adjustments large and small.\" That could have been a tough question, but Todd neutralised it at the last minute. 8.13pm: Obama uses Todd's question as a springboard to lecture for a while about how we can't let the crisis force a short-term perspective: \"fleeting prosperity\" is no good; education, healthcare and innovation are crucial. 8.14pm: No, not good enough, apparently: Chuck Todd wants Obama to make \"a specific call to action\" to the American people. Huh? This, of course, just enables the president to respond with further praise for the sacrifices the American people are already making. Chuck Todd is behaving strangely this evening. 8.15pm: ABC's Jake Tapper: Will you sign the budget if it doesn't contain a middle-class tax cut, and a cap-and-trade approach to emissons trading, since Congress is moving to strip parts of these out? Obama dodges a little, talking about what he does want to see in his budget. The middle-class tax cut will be in place for the next two years in any case, he notes. 8.19pm: The dashing Chip Reid of CBS News, who seems to make Obama want to chuckle, for some reason, steps up with a question on the ever-increasing deficit. The president stresses that he's inheriting a deficit from the very people who are attacking him on the issue, and repeats his promise to cut the deficit in half during his first term. \"Our assumptions are perfectly consistent with what blue-chip forecasters out there are saying.\" The longer term future can't be known for sure -- \"but here's what I do know\": if we don't invest in healthcare, education, the environment, and infrastructure, \"we won't grow\" at all. 8.23pm: \"And there's an intereting reason why some of these critics haven't put out their own budgets,\" Obama goes on, getting a little law-professorish: it's because they don't want to admit that dealing with America's bloated and wasteful healthcare system is the only real way to make things better. \"It is going to be an impossible task for us to balance our budget if we're not taking on rising healthcare costs,\" he says. Helen Thomas looks unimpressed, but then again, she always does. 8.31pm: Pardon me: a technical hitch here at Deadline USA liveblogging headquarters, during which a Hispanic reporter asked Obama about safeguarding the Mexican border -- no newsworthiness in Obama's response -- and a nervous-seeming reporter for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes asked about where and how, exactly, he plans to make cutbacks in military spending. 8.36pm: Ed Henry, of CNN, tries to squeeze in about 18 questions into one, asking Obama -- among other things -- why he took several days after learning of the AIG bonuses to make a public statement about them, and whether Andrew Cuomo, New York's attorney general, hasn't made more practical progress on the bonus issue than has the White House. (Cuomo managed to get most of the 10 biggest AIG bonuses returned, we recently learned.) And doesn't Obama fear leaving his daughters -- or his successor as president -- an even worse economic mess? \"Of course I do,\" Obama replies, disarmingly, but again stresses that long-term investments in education, innovation and infrastructure are the way to prevent that. This is tonight's main theme, it seems. 8.37pm: Henry repeats his question: why did Obama wait one or two days to express his anger over AIG? A real flash of irritation in Obama's reply: \"I took one or two days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak,\" he says, crossly. 8.40pm: The amusing -- if not always intentionally so -- Major Garrett of Fox News asks whether Obama is concerned about the fact that the world, including \"China, which is run by communists\", seems to be losing confidence in the dollar. Obama replies, among other things, that the dollar is strong. 8.45pm: Apologies, further infuriating technical issues. 8.48pm: \"Could I ask you about race?\" asks Ann Compton of ABC Radio. Has the issue come up much in his presidency so far, or has the last 60 days been a colour-blind time? A slightly bizarre and non-specific question, which Obama essentially dismisses. \"The last 60 days have been dominated by me trying to fix the economy,\" he replies with a smile. 8.49pm: A Washington Times reporter asks if Obama personally wrestled with his decision on stem cells. \"I wrestle with these issues every day,\" Obama responds. \"By the time an issue reaches my desk, it's a hard issue.\" 8.52pm: Token British accent: an AFP reporter asking if there's any real chance of Israeli-Palestinian progress given the recent changes in the Israeli government. \"It's not easier than it was, but it's just as necessary... what we do know is this: that the status quo is unsustainable. That it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution.\" Persistence can pay off, though: look at the two sides in the Irish conflict, celebrating St Patrick's Day together in the White House last week. Obama explains that he's going to be reiterating the \"persistence\" message a lot, domestically and internationally. \"We're going to stay with it as long as I'm in this office... hopefully in four years people will look back and say, it's a big ocean liner, we're not going to turn it around immediately\" -- but we're going in the right direction. Well, I'm not sure about the \"America as ocean liner\" analogy, but Obama's message was fairly simple tonight: \"Bear with me.\" Given his recent string of media appearances, you can't fault his efforts to try to make the population at large feel involved in the process. But - as he made every effort to hammer home tonight - it's going to be a long, long process, and it's only just beginning. This liveblog, in contrast, is at an end. Here's to a future filled with patience and sober common purpose. Can't wait! Thanks for reading and commenting ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
