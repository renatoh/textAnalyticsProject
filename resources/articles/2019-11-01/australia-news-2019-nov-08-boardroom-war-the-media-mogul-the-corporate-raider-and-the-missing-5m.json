The media mogul is Anthony Catalano, the corporate raider is Nicholas Bolton and the millions? Well, the stock exchange is investigating what happened to it. Guardian Australia understands the money was to be used in Catalano\u2019s most recent play: the purchase of a stake in Australian Community Media (ACM), the old Rural Press operation that runs a string of regional papers including the Canberra Times. Two sources have said a company called Keybridge, the management of which is dominated by Bolton, handed the $5m to Catalano. Bolton, who has a string of corporate failures behind him, is no stranger to controversy. And nor is Catalano. After leaving Fairfax in 2008, he founded the Weekly Review group of suburban free newspapers, which, fuelled by a wave of real estate advertising, he built into a substantial empire before selling it to Fairfax. He rejoined Fairfax as head of its real estate listings division, Domain, and shepherded it through a successful stock exchange listing before resigning last year in controversial circumstances. Catalano and his partner Alex Waislitz, a Melbourne businessman who was formerly married into the billionaire Pratt family, bought ACM from Nine Entertainment Co on 30 June. But although Keybridge\u2019s money went into a trust account at Nine\u2019s law firm Ashurst, and then on to the media company, Keybridge has yet to receive any shares in ACM. Nor has Keybridge got the money back. It isn\u2019t even admitting that the money was supposed to be used to buy shares in ACM, instead telling the market it was for a \u201cproposed transaction\u201d that it was \u201cunable to consummate\u201d. Understandably, some of Keybridge\u2019s shareholders are concerned about what\u2019s happened to the cash, which represented about a quarter of the total assets declared in its most recent annual report. They remain worried despite assurances from Keybridge that there\u2019s nothing to worry about because the counterparty to the deal has given a personal guarantee of the money. Keybridge \u201chas been, and remains engaged, in ongoing discussions with the counterparty to the proposed transaction in an attempt to resolve impediments to the transaction completing as originally intended\u201d, the company said in its last update to the ASX on the issue. But that was on 18 October, almost three weeks ago. Adding to the uncertainty, Guardian Australia has been told that the guarantee has since expired. The cash crisis has helped provoke a boardroom brouhaha at Keybridge that has spilled over into the courts, where two groups of shareholders, each holding about 20% of the company, have been slugging it out. In one corner is Bolton, who got his start in the 2000s selling internet domain names before pulling off a famous deal at the age of 26 in 2009, when he obtained $4.5m from Thiess John Holland in a play involving a struggling toll road project in Brisbane. Sadly his management of the domain names business and several other companies was allegedly subpar, resulting in 13 of them failing and him serving a three-year ban from corporate life that expired in November. Opposed to Bolton is the Perth-based chairman of Bentley Capital, Farooq Khan, an experienced corporate raider with a long and controversial history of trying to force companies that are hoarding cash to hand their winnings over to shareholders. Watching on, and also sitting on about 20% of Keybridge, is the Wilson Asset Management group controlled by Geoff Wilson, who, in tandem with his distant relative and Liberal MP Tim Wilson, ran a successful campaign against Labor\u2019s proposal to end cash franking credit refunds in the run-up to May\u2019s election. Bolton and Geoff Wilson declined to comment.

For his part, Khan said legal proceedings meant he could not confirm a report in the Australian Financial Review that the $5m was supposed to be invested in ACM. \u201cThe heart of the dispute is that we had the agreement, [were] told we had the shares in this regional media asset, and then told on the turn of a dime no,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTo have nearly all the company\u2019s money go out the door and just have this pattern of obstruction \u2026 was just an intolerable situation.\u201d Trade in Keybridge shares has been suspended since July amid an ASX investigation. A spokesman for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the corporate regulator was also aware of the issue but the investigation was in the hands of the exchange. Keybridge\u2019s annual report, released on Wednesday, fails to identify the recipient of the $5m \u2013 but it does provide some tantalising clues. In the report, Keybridge said it handed over the money in return for all the units in a unit trust. The company that runs the trust then handed the money over in return for 16.67% of \u201can operating company\u201d. However, Keybridge says the trustee company has failed to transfer the shares into the trust. \u201cThe trustee has advised that the vesting is dependent on the consent/agreement of the other shareholders of the investee company,\u201d Keybridge said. \u201cIf their consent/agreement is not ultimately forthcoming, the trustee has undertaken to transfer $5m cash into the unit trust in lieu of the 16.67% equity interest.\u201d On 31 July the trustee company\u2019s sole director agreed to an \u201cunconditional and irrevocable\u201d guarantee of the $5m, Keybridge said. The structure described closely matches that used by Catalano and Waislitz to acquire ACM. Asic records show that when the pair first bought the media group, they used a company called 19 Cashews as a vehicle to hold the shareholdings of investors. 19 Cashews was half owned by Tiga Trading, a Waislitz family vehicle, a third owned by Kirant Media Investments, which is controlled by Catalano and his third wife Stefanie, and one sixth \u2013 or 16.67% \u2013 owned by a company called Kirant Regional Media Investments. Kirant Regional Media Investments has just one director, Antony Catalano. However, what\u2019s not clear is why Keybridge would be entitled to so much of ACM, given that the purchase price was $115m. But the other factor that has market observers pointing to the ACM deal as the likely destination for Keybridge\u2019s $5m is that Catalano and Bolton have worked together in the past. Back in November, Bolton backed Catalano in an ill-fated last-minute attempt to derail Nine\u2019s takeover of Fairfax Media. Catalano and the ACM managing director, Allen Williams, a former Fairfax executive, did not respond to calls and text messages, while Craig Smith, a longtime Waislitz employee who serves as contact point for the rich lister\u2019s investment company, Thorney Investments, and is also the company secretary of 19 Cashews, could not be reached. Back at Keybridge, the boardroom war tearing the company apart led its auditor, Deloitte, to take the rare step of refusing to sign off on the company\u2019s accounts. The Deloitte partner Ian Skelton said he and his team were \u201cunable to satisfy ourselves as to the integrity of the group\u2019s books and records and, in particular, whether certain transactions recorded in the group\u2019s accounting records were appropriately authorised and undertaken for the group\u2019s benefit\u201d. As for the $5m? \u201cWe have been unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence or the underlying agreements in respect of this advance to enable us to determine whether it will be recoverable by the group,\u201d Skelton said in his audit report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
