A review this summer is likely to see major electrification projects shelved until the next decade as escalating costs add billions to the bill. The Office of Rail and Road said it would be a \u201cvery tall order\u201d to deliver the \u00a338bn plan, and that passengers would be feeling the impact through poorer train services. Network Rail on Thursday also published annual accounts showing its debt has risen by almost \u00a35bn in a year to \u00a337.8bn. Despite political and regulatory pressure to cut costs, spending in many areas has increased, leaving other schemes in the firing line. The electrification of the Midland mainline \u2013 described by Network Rail as \u201ccritical to delivering a reliable and sustainable railway and tackling overcrowding\u201d on the line from London to Sheffield \u2013 could now be axed. The ORR report showed that more than a third of the \u201cmilestones\u201d in major enhancement projects had been missed, failing to reach 30 out of 84 targets in the first year of the 2014-19 plan. The regulator said \u201cthe high number of missed milestones has raised serious questions about Network Rail\u2019s ability to deliver future projects on time\u201d. Fewer than one in four of the renewals to overhead lines scheduled for this year have been carried out, and only a third of signalling works. Despite the backlog, Network Rail will also miss its budgetary targets by \u00a3430m. Richard Price, the chief executive of ORR, said that Network Rail had \u201csystemic issues\u201d, including wide discrepancies in how it measured its work and kept track of the state of the railway, as well as problems in planning and management structures \u2013 issues it had tried to deny in the past. Price said that Mark Carne, who took over as Network Rail\u2019s chief executive a year ago, \u201crecognises all of these points\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant step up in Network Rail\u2019s candour on these points but what we need to see is evidence of efficiency in addressing these areas.\u201d The report underlines problems at Network Rail that have caused consternation in Whitehall since the rail infrastructure owner and operator\u2019s burgeoning debt came onto the government\u2019s balance sheet last September. Annual results published on Thursday showed the debt had risen to \u00a337.8bn from just under \u00a333bn in 2014. Patrick McLoughin, the transport secretary, is understood to be resisting pressure from the Treasury to explore a possible break-up and privatisation of Network Rail, but on Thursday he refused to rule it out in response to questions in the Commons. The budget for electrification of the Great Western mainline has leapt 50% to \u00a31.8bn, from an initial estimate of \u00a31.2bn, with well-placed industry sources fearing increases of a similar scale are likely on other upgrades. Network Rail said it had \u201crecognised the scale of the challenge and has been openly reporting performance data regularly\u201d. \u201cThere are clearly opportunities to improve following decades of under-investment in the rail network. However, it is worth highlighting that we operate the safest passenger network in Europe and the railway asset reliability is the best it has ever been.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
