As the FA maintained its stance that it will not bow to pressure from the anti\u2011racism group Kick It Out and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association to hold a new inquiry into the Eni Aluko affair, discussions have started behind the scenes to choose which members of his squad should speak publicly in a choreographed attempt to help clear his name. Sampson has been accused of making two allegedly racist comments \u2013 one to Aluko and another to a mixed-race player \u2013 but earned a character reference from Gareth Southgate during a press conference to announce the latest England men\u2019s squad at St George\u2019s Park, the FA\u2019s headquarters, on Thursday. \u201cYou speak as you find and, in my view, he is an excellent character,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no hesitation in saying that.\u201d Sampson has been cleared of any wrongdoing in relation to the allegation that he asked the mixed-race player, on her first England call-up, how many times she had been arrested. However, the FA\u2019s internal inquiry and the follow-up investigation, conducted on behalf of the FA by the barrister Katharine Newton, have been described as a \u201cfarce\u201d by Aluko after an admission from the governing body that the mixed-raced player was never contacted. Aluko alleged in an interview with the Guardian on Monday that Sampson had asked her to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring Ebola to Wembley \u2013 another claim Sampson denies \u2013 and is one of three players, along with Lianne Sanderson and Anita Asante, who have criticised the culture of the FA and the England women\u2019s team. Sampson has been advised by the FA not to say anything until nearer England\u2019s next game, against Russia on 19 September, and that left Southgate to defend his colleague and address what he described as a \u201cvery sensitive subject\u201d. Asked how worrying it was that black players were questioning the culture within the FA, Southgate said: \u201cIt is very important that the culture is right and that all players feel that. There is no question we take that very seriously. We want all players to feel they belong here so that they can perform to their best when they are with us. And that we are inclusive. \u201cI\u2019ve always spoken, from when I took the job, about the importance of the culture around the team. It\u2019s crucially important we have that right in order to get the atmosphere right, and then the performances can be the best they possibly can. My feeling is the culture is very good here. I can\u2019t talk for specific camps or meetings or age groups I\u2019ve not been involved in, but I sense we are heading in a good direction.\u201d Southgate added he had met Sampson at St George\u2019s Park on Wednesday. \u201cI spoke to him on a human level, to see how he and his family are, because they have to go through all of this and that will have a big impact for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
