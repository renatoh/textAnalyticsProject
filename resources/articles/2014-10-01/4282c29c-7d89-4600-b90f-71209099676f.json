It condemns gay marriage yet supports legalised marijuana and reforms to the Pinochet-era constitution. Though the pro-Pinochet forces have been organised for at least six years as a movement known as \u201cFor My Country\u201d, after the arrest of a top Pinochet aide last week, Augusto Pinochet Molina, grandson of the dictator, stepped up formation of what supporters described as a centre-right political party. While the proposed party acknowledges that the military abused citizens, they never speak of a dictatorship but of a \u201cmilitary government\u201d followed by \u201ca witch hunt\u201d and a \u201cvendetta\u201d that jailed dozens of officers for the murder and disappearance of some 3,200 Chileans during the 17 years of Pinochet\u2019s rule. Pinochet Molina this week also sent out hundreds of invitations to the 99th birthday party of the dictator to be celebrated on 25 November. The location remains secret but among the invited guests is Cristian Labb\u00e9, a former Pinochet bodyguard charged last week with being part of a conspiracy to kidnap and murder 13 political prisoners. A former captain in the Chilean army, Pinochet Molina was kicked out of the military after an impromptu speech he made at his grandfather\u2019s 2006 funeral in Santiago, in which he applauded his grandfather\u2019s campaign to \u201cdefeat Marxism\u201d in Chile. A one time candidate for congress, Pinochet Molina is now positioning himself to run for office again. \u201cAugusto wanted to invite him because it is known that Labb\u00e9 is a grand admirer of his grandfather, so for that very reason it would be an honour,\u201d said Paolo Zarate, general secretary of For My Country in an interview. Pinochet Molina\u2019s decision to launch a political party is the latest salvo in a battle to lay claim to the now-deceased dictator\u2019s legacy. For nearly a quarter of a century, the rightwing UDI party has held a lock on what Chilean pollsters call \u201cthe military family\u201d, a conservative and influential bloc of voters. But moves to shut down a country club-style prison for imprisoned military officers and ongoing efforts to jail human rights violators has led to claims that even the pro-Pinochet UDI party has abandoned their former hero. When Labb\u00e9 was detained last week, a parade of rightwing politicians including senators went to honour their former colleague, though they sought to describe the visit as purely \u201chumane\u201d and not political. \u201cIt is a party destined to be minority and most of all fascist,\u201d said Chilean senator Alejandro Navarro in an interview with CNN."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
