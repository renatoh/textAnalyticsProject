Australia have won 11 consecutive Ashes series since Great Britain's last success in 1970, and have not lost a series in this country since 1959. But after Great Britain's 20-12 victory at the McAlpine stadium on Sunday, they are now in danger of an unwanted place in history, and with it a slice of national shame. As Chris Anderson, their coach, put it: \"I would rather not have my name associated with a losing side.\" The captain Brad Fittler, who will retire from representative rugby at the end of his third Kangaroo tour, said he could \"not even contemplate going out of rep footy as a losing Australian skipper against Great Britain . . . believe me, nobody wants to carry that burden this time\". Fittler, unlike Anderson, has been here before. On each of the last two tours, when Bob Fulton was the coach, Australia came back after losing the first Test at Wembley to take the series with wins at Old Trafford and Elland Road. Fittler remains confident they can do so again. \"I think we did enough to prove to ourselves that we can win the next two games,\" he said. \"We were a bit rusty and I'm sure we'll be better for the run.\" However, Australia may be denied the services of Jason Stevens, their most experienced forward and a born-again Christian, who has been ordered to appear at a disciplinary hearing today after being put on report on Sunday for a distinctly un-Christian stamp on the Great Britain prop Terry O'Connor. \"I was just moving forward, I didn't go out of my way to get him,\" said Stevens, whose family are due to arrive in England today to watch the second and third Tests. He remains hopeful that their journey will not be wasted, adding: \"I haven't had much to do with the judiciary over here, so I don't know what to expect. But there were about 20 incidents during the game that were just as bad as each other.\" Anderson also suggested that suspension would be harsh: \"It was a Test match, so hopefully sanity will prevail.\" But Great Britain's coach David Waite described the incident, which forced O'Connor off for 20 stitches, as \"nasty\" and his captain Andy Farrell joked that \"Michael Jackson would have been proud\" - of Stevens' footwork, presumably. Great Britain will have to contend with an Australian referee, as Bill Harrigan - better known as Hollywood for his love of the limelight - will take over from Wigan's Bob Connolly. \"Different referee, possibly different sides, one coming off a loss and the other off a win,\" added Waite. He will discover today whether Adrian Morley and Terry Newton are available after failing to recover from arm injuries in time for the first Test. But Phil Clarke, the Great Britain manager, again ruled the St Helens hooker Keiron Cunningham out of the series yesterday even though Cunningham himself is hopeful of being fit for the third Test at Wigan on Saturday week. And just when things were looking up for the financially embattled Rugby Football League, who were gleefully anticipating a rush on tickets for the last two Tests - the phone system at their Red Hall headquarters jammed up and collapsed yesterday. \u00b7Shane Richardson has resigned as Hull's chief executive after two years to take a job with Penrith Panthers in the west of Sydney. Dewsbury, though, have appointed a new chief executive, the former Wakefield Trinity coach John Harbin, on a two-year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
