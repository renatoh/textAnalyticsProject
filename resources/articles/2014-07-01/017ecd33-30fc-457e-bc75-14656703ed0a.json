It was a tradition that reached back to a time when wars were fought with swords and muskets, instead of heavy artillery that could cut men down in hitherto unimaginable \u2013 but soon realised \u2013 numbers. Although some commanding officers broke with tradition when they saw the scale of this new kind of slaughter, and started placing their pipers behind rather than before their advancing troops, nearly half the 2,500 pipers who served were killed or injured, their music \u2013 like so much else \u2013 silenced. It was a new story (at least to ignorant Sassenachs like me) and as poignant and moving as any from those four godforsaken years, but badly \u2013 badly, badly, badly \u2013 let down by a section purporting to test whether the pipes could indeed make soldiers perform better by making a group of army cadets run on treadmills and perform strength tests after hearing it. I presume that this moronic, irreverent break in mood, so pointlessly taking up time that could have been much better spent telling us more about the tradition from which the pipers sprang, was some kind of mindless lunge towards a younger audience. As if they are not capable of appreciating the ineffable. As if they cannot see that increasing respiration rates are not the same as putting heart into a man. As if the men went over the top because their blood was full of oxygen instead of courage, fear and pride. If I see anything more crass and contemptuous this centenary, I shall pipe myself straight to the BBC director general Tony Hall's office and smash it to bits. At the end, Garth Newlands played Flowers of the Forest across the fields of France on the pipes his great-grandfather Alexander Newlands had played through Ypres, the Somme and Vimy Ridge. It was written in 1513 in tribute to the dead of Flodden and still it must play on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
