The art school graduate's design for a super-slim, folding three-point plug is the stuff of design miracles. Quite why no one has beaten him to it is a mystery. Although as safe as houses, the sturdy British three-pin plug is incongruous next to the latest digital gizmos, and when travelling it is an encumbrance and a danger to other, more delicate things. It's also downright ugly. The folding plug isn't just sensible, it's a surprisingly pretty thing to look at. Unfolded, it resembles a butterfly as seen by some happily abstract artist. It is also easy to use, needing just two smooth movements to fold or unfold. The choice of the plug as the winner of this year's Brit Insurance design of the year is a particularly happy one as popular taste has begun to recoil from the over-the-top, \"iconic\" design excesses of the past decade. The plug is in a long tradition of everyday, commonplace designs, from paperclips to Post-it notes, that are as useful as they are pleasurable to look at. The list of small things that need rethinking is long. Would Choi like to look at keys? Or a gizmo that would operate all white goods, TVs or sound systems? Such things are considered trivial compared with the challenge of designing chairs, cars and even cutlery, and yet these are the very designs, or lack of them, that raise our collective blood pressure. Come and save us, Min-Kyu Choi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
