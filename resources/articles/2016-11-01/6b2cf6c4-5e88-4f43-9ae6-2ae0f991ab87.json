He wrote a family history about the experiences of African slaves in the Ottoman empire and their descendants, and was the founder of the Africans\u2019 Culture and Solidarity Association in Turkey. Mustafa was born in the Aegean town of Ayvalik, Turkey, the fifth child of Kemale, a seamstress, and Mehmet, a marble worker. He began work straight after primary school in a lathe workshop, and not long afterwards became involved in the labour movement. In 1978, he married his first wife, Sevgi, and had two children, \u00d6zg\u00fcr and Zeynep. He and Sevgi later divorced. In the 1990s, Mustafa began to put pen to paper to better understand his life experiences. As he explored his family\u2019s history, he discovered its connection to slavery. In 2002 he published a short volume entitled Kemale, his mother\u2019s life story. In it, Mustafa details the family\u2019s history, from their capture in Africa, their transport across land and sea, and enslavement on Ottoman Crete. He describes his relatives\u2019 daily life and work on Crete and their difficult journey to Anatolia. Some family members arrived before the Greek-Turkish population exchange of the 1920s; others during it. They arrived on the shores of the fledgling Turkish republic speaking only Greek, as did the majority of Muslims on Crete, and were thus subjected to harassment and had difficulty finding work. Because of her dark complexion, Kemale was excluded by the other children. She left school early to help make money for the family, and had nine children of whom Mustafa was the fifth. After further research, the book evolved into Mustafa\u2019s 2005 masterpiece, Kenya-Crete-Istanbul: Human Biographies from the Slave Coast, a personal story of the relatively overlooked history of African slavery in the Ottoman empire \u2013 that simultaneously raised the profile of people of African descent in Turkey. The book\u2019s success enabled Mustafa to organise the Afro-Turk community. In 2006, the Africans\u2019 Culture and Solidarity Association held its inaugural meeting, attended by journalists, academics and the head of the Unesco Slave Route project. The centrepiece of the organisation\u2019s activities is the Calf festival \u2013 loosely modelled on a festival of the same name celebrated by enslaved African communities throughout the Ottoman empire. This festival is now an annual gathering for people of African descent in Turkey, and we visited Mustafa there on several occasions during the course of our academic research. The 10th anniversary festival was held in June this year. It was, in many ways, a celebration of Mustafa himself, who had tirelessly devoted his life to guiding the movement. He is survived by his second wife, G\u00fcler, a primary school administrator, and by \u00d6zg\u00fcr and Zeynep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
