However, the signs are that for school governors 2007 will be a critical year, when their very existence comes under scrutiny, and, for some, it will mean the end of their service in school. As governors we all have a stake in the school we represent. We try to bring help and expertise, untainted by commercial or political agendas. The school community, in particular its pupils, must be paramount in all we do. Elected parent governors allow the voice of parents to be heard, while community, partnership, local authority and staff governors also provide unbiased commitment. Last year's Education and Inspections Act gave schools the option to become foundations with a trust that can appoint the majority of the governing body. But this has prompted a \"health warning to governors\" from Judith Bennett, chair of the National Governors' Association. Writing in the NGA's newsletter, she says: \"To follow this path, the governing body will be making an active move away from the stakeholder model. Only one parent-governor will be elected; the remainder will be appointed. This would allow the trust to choose like-minded individuals who are not necessarily representative of the parent body - and the democratic process by which parent governors have been created will all but disappear.\" She adds that a school that chooses to be run by such a trust is moving away from the balanced stakeholder representation and from local accountability. \"To me it is a loosening of ties with the community in which the school is set.\" However, in the same issue of NGA News, the schools minister Jim Knight, quizzed about the stakeholder model by the deputy chair, Stephen Adamson, says: \"We still see parents having a very important voice and a role for community governors and local authority representation. It's very important that we retain the notion of stakeholders.\" Furthermore, he stresses that it is up to existing governors to decide on their own model of governance. \"It's up to governing bodies whether they want a charitable trust to appoint a majority or minority of governors. It's up to governors, when the package is put together, to decide whether the trust appoints the majority or minority of governors.\" So are you going to vote yourself into oblivion this year? You don't want to do that. But hang on a minute, governors act for the good of their schools and not their own personal gain, don't they? There will be some very interesting debates ahead. An awful lot is at stake. \u00b7 www.nga.org.uk. Education.governor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
