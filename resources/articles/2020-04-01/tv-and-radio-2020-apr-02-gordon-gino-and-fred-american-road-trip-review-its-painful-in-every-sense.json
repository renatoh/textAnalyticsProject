The contrived scenarios. The forced banter. The woefully scripted links. The hilarious inclusion of bloopers that are neither hilarious nor, actually, bloopers. The pitifully fragile masculinity on display throughout. All of the above are of course present in the latest instalment of the Gordon, Gino and Fred franchise, Gordon, Gino and Fred: American Road Trip (ITV). For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that Gordon is Gordon Ramsay, of Gordon Ramsay fame, Gino is Gino d\u2019Acampo of \u201cbeginning his career as This Morning\u2019s chef and presenting several of his own cookery series since\u201d fame, and Fred is Fred Sirieix of First Dates fame. It is his conciliatory charm and ineffable grace that keep the two chefs from killing each other and provide balm to the soul of any viewer who would otherwise find the whole setup too pointlessly exhausting, especially in already emotionally draining times. The trio begin in Mexico, and start off drearily true to type. Gordon finds it smelly and dirty, and is grumpy. Gino is happy: \u201cThe dog shit is part of the experience!\u201d Fred is quiet and patient. They get on a coach and Gordon learns that the word \u201cavocado\u201d derives from the Mexican word for \u201ctesticle\u201d because avocados look like testicles. They go to a tequila bar in Tijuana. They drink tequila. Gordon finds a bottle with a literal rattlesnake literally pickled in it and decides it\u2019s time to find out who is \u201cBilly Big Bollocks or Billy Bullshit\u201d. It\u2019s practically all balls so far. Then it\u2019s cars for a bit. They get a big Jeep thing. Sorry \u2013 \u201cmammoth set of wheels\u201d known as \u201cBetty the Beast\u201d. They drive to a local market, and, with crushing inevitability, dare each other to eat the hottest chillies there. As the hour wears on, however, the stopped-clock-right-twice-a-day principle comes into play, and moments of humour and interest arise. The most fascinating, at least to those of us with enough miles on another clock and memories that are still just about managing to function in lockdown is the sight of what we might almost call the real, or at least the original screen version of, Gordon Ramsay. Once upon a time, children, long, long ago, Gordon was a respected Michelin-starred chef who achieved fame with a series called Ramsay\u2019s Kitchen Nightmares. And people and critics watched and called him horribly rude and aggressive. But, children, he was not. He was a respected, Michelin-starred chef who wanted idiots in charge of culinary establishments to raise their game and become competent in the field they had stupidly chosen; and so become viable business owners and happier people. At the beginning, he was a man trying to instil notions of quality and pride in people who were eight parts turnip to two parts sloth. Eventually, though, they and the people who insisted on seeing \u201chaving professional standards\u201d as the height of discourtesy broke him, and he became the raging bull we know and tire of today. The cold, clear fury with which he reacts to Gino\u2019s interpretation of ceviche and his genuine offence at his fellow chef\u2019s attitude (or ignorance, it matters not \u2013 Gordon is concerned with ends, not means) is a reminder of the good old days. As is his concentration when making a meal for all the employees at the La Cocina de Do\u00f1a Esthela in Valle de Guadalupe, whose machaca con huevos (shredded beef with scrambled eggs) holds the title of \u201cworld\u2019s best breakfast\u201d, and his compulsive insistence on everyone \u2013 especially sous chef Gino \u2013 getting it right. How you do anything is how you do everything; it\u2019s a credo only a few of us can live by and it must be \u2013 um \u2013 challenging to live with. But it\u2019s wonderful to watch. I wonder if he ever regrets letting the brand mask eat the professional face? The first episode ends with some painful \u2013 in every sense \u2013 nonsense involving local wrestlers. \u201cFuck this shit,\u201d says Gino after a few minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make guacamole.\u201d Words, overall, to live by."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
