Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who was recorded without his knowledge by a Conservative friend, said the election for Labour was \u201cdire\u201d outside urban areas. Corbyn dismissed the leaked exchange as a private \u201cbit of banter between two old friends\u201d during a campaign visit to Carlisle, a key marginal held by the Tories with a majority of 2,599 votes. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chat with Jon Ashworth, he called me straight away. He\u2019s out there campaigning for a Labour government,\u201d the Labour leader told the BBC. \u201cHe\u2019s out there defending the National Health Service. Jon has my full support. We get along great.\u201d Ashworth faced a day of questions over the leaked conversation, taped by a friend with whom he had previously been on holiday to the US. Corbyn said: \u201cHe said to me it was all about reverse psychology banter, as in football supporters, and the other person was saying the opposite about their party and it all got a bit out of hand. \u201cJon has been a fantastic shadow secretary of state for health. He\u2019s exposed what this government is doing.\u201d At a pub in Morton, a suburb of Carlisle, Corbyn was greeted by supporters singing \u201coh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. He spoke about the NHS and the picture of four-year-old Jack Willment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary, which was shared widely online after being printed on the front page of the Daily Mirror. \u201cWe have a prime minister who hides the truth when it\u2019s put in front of him with a picture, takes the mobile of somebody and sticks it in their pocket,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, they are uncomfortable pictures, but I thank those papers for printing those uncomfortable pictures, because imagine what it\u2019s like being that child, ill, wanting support.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
