At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed.\" If, like me, you haven't seen Joel and Ethan Coen's black comedy masterpiece for a long time, you might also only remember certain things. Not all the intricacies of the plot, but certainly Frances McDormand's Marge Gunderson, Steve Buscemi and (in) a woodchipper, but also the look and the feel of the whole thing, maybe even the sound. You will probably remember how much you loved it too. Which makes watching this new TV Fargo \u2013 created by Noah Hawley with the blessing of, but no creative input from, the Coens \u2013 a strange one. The story may be different, but so much is either immediately familiar or quickly rejigs. The road, a dark slash through frozen white upper mid-western wasteland, squad car pulled over; Allison Tolman's Molly Solverson is a toned-down Gunderson (though it's not her who's pregnant); the William H Macy role, the hapless, dissatisfied salesman getting sucked downward into hell, is taken by our own Martin Freeman because American acting unions now demand that every major US TV series has at least one Limey (not sure about the accent, Mart, but then I'm not really in a position to judge; I'll leave it to the good folk of Minnesota); Billy Bob Thornton is the devil, the roving hitman gloriously injecting evil into small-town insularity. Then there's the atmosphere, the humour, the hilarious horror. And the themes of human weakness, violence and masculinity, that good men can do bad stuff, and that that can be very funny. There's something almost dreamlike about the experience of watching it. Like revisiting a favourite old childhood haunt; a funfair, perhaps, because the original Fargo was so joyful. Some of the rides have moved, or been changed, or updated, but the feel of the place, the look and the sound, the terror and the laughing, is the same. It could have been a terrible idea to return, but it's not, because it's all coming flooding back, making you remember just why and how much you once loved it. New Fargo is also full of joy \u2013 the joy of artful claret, bad men, good jokes and good lines (\"Chas is working the ham\" is my favourite so far \u2013 meaning he's massaging it, grotesquely, to improve the flavour). It's finely performed (by Tolman and BBT especially). What could have been a disaster, enraging Fargo aficionados, is a respectful homage, and should quench a thirst they had half forgotten they have. What it doesn't have, of course, is originality. Not just because of Fargo 1.0, but also the Coens' more recent stuff (there's something of the Javier Bardem character from No Country for Old Men in Thornton's hitman), and all the other post-Fargo television that has delved into the murkier reaches of the human mind, from The Sopranos to Breaking Bad. That doesn't mean there's not room for more, if it's good, and so far this is. Plus, as this first episode (of 10) goes on, it appears to be growing \u2013 in pace, in confidence, in its own identity. Maybe not just a loyal homage then, but as if Hawley has taken the original and shoved it in the ole woodchipper himself. Now he's spraying it out on to the frozen white. Same style, same blood, same gory beauty and humour, but something in its own right too; unique. Hope so. Will I be coming back to see? You betcha. Ben Fogle \u2013 TV man still searching for TV niche \u2013 is also around these parts, in Storm City (Sky1, Sunday). Well, over the border at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, where he's in a climate chamber, experiencing a simulated ice storm. A machine blasts him with supercooled rain which freezes instantly on hitting him, forming icicles. Ha, he's like an ice sculpture of one of the Oods from Doctor Who. But what's with the goggles and all the protective clothing? Shouldn't he be in his pants, properly feeling the cold like the fella in Fargo? Storm City is also available on Sky 3D, though sadly I don't have the technology for that. Not that sadly \u2013 I think Ben Fogle in 3D, even as an ice Ood, could be one D too many."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
