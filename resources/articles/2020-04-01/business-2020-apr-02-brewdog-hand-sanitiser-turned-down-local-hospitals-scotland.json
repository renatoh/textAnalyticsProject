The firm said last month it would be giving away its \u201cpunk sanitiser\u201d free to charities and to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. While the sanitiser is 68% alcohol, well above the 60% minimum recommended by the Health and Safety Executive in the UK, it does not meet more stringent requirements for a medical environment. A spokesman for NHS Grampian, which includes the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, said: \u201cWe are very grateful for the offer from many local businesses, including BrewDog, to support the NHS at this time. \u201cOur supplies and equipment have to reach clinical standards before they can be put into use in healthcare settings and we have worked closely with the team at BrewDog to overcome some of these technical issues. This has been a really successful collaboration with the BrewDog team and we look forward to getting the gel fully operational in health and care settings right across Grampian. We at no time \u2018rejected\u2019 the offer, we instead chose to work together on finding a solution.\u201d BrewDog\u2019s founder, James Watt, said it had distributed 100,000 bottles of sanitiser to groups including the Archie Foundation and Aberlour children\u2019s charities and would continue to supply frontline workers and charities. He said: \u201cWe started making hand sanitiser at our distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, in response to the national shortage and are doing everything we can to help. \u201cThe production of sanitiser is completely new for us, we are working closely with the NHS to understand how we can best meet their requirements for clinical care.\u201d BrewDog began producing sanitiser last month amid shortages of the alcohol-based hand cleaner, which has been flagged as an important tool in combatting coronavirus. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2020. The headline and introduction were updated to clarify that it was the initial batch of BrewDog hand sanitiser that was turned down by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary because it did not meet clinical standards. As the text made clear, the brewer and the NHS trust hope to produce a hand gel that is suitable for hospital use."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
