The four-man commission imposed the punishments on Evra after ruling that the Frenchman had attacked the Chelsea groundsman Sam Bethell as the players conducted their warm-down on the pitch. Chelsea were fined \u00a325,000 for failing to ensure Bethell conducted himself in an orderly fashion but an allegation made by a member of the visiting team's staff that the groundsman had \"engaged in racist conduct or language\" was not proved. Chelsea, who had consistently denied the claim, were cleared of that charge. While there was a sense of vindication at the London club, United were moved to condemn the sanctions imposed upon their defender. The club released a brief statement confirming: \"Manchester United notes the announcement from the FA and is disappointed with the decision and in particular considers the sanctions against Patrice Evra excessive. Manchester United and Patrice will consider all options once there has been an opportunity to digest the full reasons for the decision.\" That hinted at a potential appeal with Evra \u2014 already banned from the game at Tottenham Hotspur on December 13 \u2014 now due to miss Premier League matches against Stoke and Middlesbrough, the FA Cup third-round tie with Southampton and the first leg of United's Carling Cup semi-final next month. That will leave the France international without a competitive game, other than the Club World Cup in Japan, between next Wednesday's Champions League tie with Aalborg and Chelsea's visit to Old Trafford on January 11. Evra had admitted pushing the Chelsea head groundsman in the chest, then running back to confront Bethell after the incident had appeared to calm down. The commission also ruled that he had struck Bethell on the side of the head. Chelsea, who described the incident as \"regrettable\", are unlikely to appeal. \"Chelsea always strenuously denied the racist allegation and that position has been totally vindicated by the FA,\" said the London club in a statement. \"Alleging racism is one of the most serious accusations that can be made in football. Chelsea has a zero tolerance attitude towards racism and is fighting hard with the rest of football to rid all forms of discrimination from the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
