Top stories The Australian defence force will have greater powers to respond to domestic terrorist incidents under changes unveiled by the federal government. Malcolm Turnbull says the changes will make it easier for ADF personnel to work with federal and state governments and their police forces in the event of a domestic terrorist attack. The move comes after his government initiated a review of the ADF\u2019s support to national counter-terrorism arrangements in 2016, after terrorist attacks around the world. He had been hinting for months of plans to strengthen Australia\u2019s counter-terrorism regime following the coronial report into the Lindt cafe siege. \u201cState and territory police forces remain the best first response to terrorist incidents, immediately after an attack starts,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201c[But] defence must be able to contribute effectively to domestic counter-terrorism efforts.\u201d Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has announced his government will continue its bloody crackdown on the alleged perpetrators of last year\u2019s failed coup attempt, vowing to \u201ccut traitors\u2019 heads off\u201d. The crackdown has been broadened to include dissidents, journalists and human rights activists, as the country entered its second year since the July 2016 moves to unseat him.

Residents, environmentalists and pastoralists have welcomed a report on fracking in the Northern Territory, which identified risks associated with the industry. The interim report said its \u201cpreliminary view\u201d was that the use of surface water for shale gas operations should be prohibited in arid and semi-arid areas and groundwater should not be permitted for use in fracking without proof there would be no adverse impacts. It also said fracking during the Top End\u2019s wet season should not be allowed at all because of the potential for storage ponds to overflow. The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the government would make its decision to either ban fracking or allow it in \u201chighly regulated circumstances\u201d once the final report was completed. The Liberal National party state conference in Queensland has voted to call for headscarves to be banned for children under 10 years old.

She said: \u2018We live in a multicultural society \u2026 They\u2019re talking about what children should wear in schools \u2013 that is the dark ages.\u201d A resolution calling for the federal government to ban immigration from countries with sharia law was defeated earlier.

Federer, 36 next month, returned from injury to win both Wimbledon and the Australian Open this year. \u201cIt\u2019s magical, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it yet.
