One was a painting by Tom Roberts, capturing the austere, sun-blasted beauty of a bush landscape; the other was a photograph of Keith Miller leaning back to put the finishing touch on a square cut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1950. Any symbolism was unconscious. Yet here, perhaps, seemed the first and last word on Menzies's country: the elemental and primal antiquity of the land, and the breezy and expansive youthfulness of its people. For no one since the second world war has fitted the bill of Australian in excelsis so exactly as Miller. An Australian might hope to have been born a Bradman, but there was only really room for one Don in the firmament. Miller not only did everything a cricketer would want to do, but the way they would want to do it, wrapped in an infectious personality that radiated carefree ease one moment and virile hostility the next. He batted with classical technique and utter abandon, playing each ball, as Raymond Robertson-Glasgow put it so exquisitely, \"just that much below its supposed merits that scratches a bowler's pride\". He could touch speeds of bowling reserved for few, so that rivals were loth to rouse him. \"The worst mistake a batsman could make,\" recalled Sir Leonard Hutton, \"was to hit him for four.\" Lounging deceptively at slip, Miller stood out even when unoccupied. He was a game of cricket in himself; he could even, when the circumstances dictated it, ooze an unstudied boredom. Though Australians distrust exhibitionism, they esteem the natural, the open, the spontaneous. And Miller was more than simply an entertainer: he had that uncanny knack of commanding attention without apparently ever seeking it. In Australia, Miller is also an historical embodiment. Just as Bradman is often seen as sporting solace of the Great Depression, Miller is associated immediately with the second world war, the warrior who beat his sword into a bat rather than a ploughshare. Defining experience A sense of destiny infests his name: Keith Ross Miller was christened as a tribute to the aviators Keith and Ross Smith, who in the week of his birth landed in Melbourne after a pioneering trip from England. And certainly, in reversing their journey at the outbreak of war as a pilot officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, Miller underwent what there is little doubt was his defining life experience. In his book Cricket Crossfire, Miller gives his war years 10 pages that read at first light-heartedly. Then you notice, dropped in laconically, phrases such as \"who later in the war was killed\", \"he crashed and was killed\", and \"six or seven of my pals had been killed\". He tells of walking away from a crash-landing with the advice: \"Nearly stumps drawn that time, gents.\" If his cricket had an air of insouciance in the face of danger, there is little wondering why. His first big cricket ensued, in fact, in the so-called Victory Tests of the English summer of 1945, where he capped off leading the batting averages with an innings of 185 for Dominions, led by Learie Constantine, against England, led by Walter Hammond. In this extraordinary three-day match of 1,241 runs, Miller's first 61, scored in the last 75 minutes of the second day, included one six on to the top tier of the pavilion. He followed it, on the third morning, with what Pelham Warner reckoned the greatest exhibition of hitting he saw in 60 years as a player and potentate. In 90 minutes of mostly orthodox but startlingly powerful batting, Miller added 124, with six further sixes: one carried to Block Q on the right of the pavilion; another landed on the roof of the broadcasting box, falling into a shrapnel hole in the roof, from which it had to be dislodged with a stick. The story goes that Miller's hitting was so violent that elderly MCC members abandoned their favourite positions and adjourned to the bar, where it was safer, though this may be fond Australian imagining. In any event, Lord's became a venue that he cherished as much as it cherished him: he made a fine Test hundred there in 1953, and harvested 10 wickets three years later. No appreciation of Miller, though, should be burdened with too much enumeration of facts. It just wasn't him. Just about every Australian can tell you Bradman's batting average; only a real aficionado can be exact about Miller's statistics. He simply stood out. In an era when cricketers did not routinely resemble athletes, he assuredly did. In an age when cricketers were not famed for being photogenic, the camera loved him, almost to distraction. Cricket, too, was the game he played during the day. He did not care to think about it too deeply in hindsight. A journalist once accosted him wanting to know how he had just taken seven for 12 in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. \"There's three reasons,\" Miller replied. \"First, I bowled bloody well. Second, I, errr ... second ...\" There was a pause. \"You can forget about the other two reasons.\" And make no mistake: Miller had \"it\". Presence, charisma, an aura - call it what you will. It was said that men wanted to be like him, women simply to be with him. He was thankful in later life that the media had in his own time been a relatively tactful institution. Over lunch in Sydney one day, a mutual friend opined that Miller would have been worth millions to the modern game and been paid accordingly. When I asked Keith if he would have wanted it that way, simply to play cricket, he looked askance. \"You know,\" he said, \"Bill O'Reilly said to me just before he died: 'Keith, we were lucky to play cricket when we did.' He didn't have to say anything else. I knew exactly what he meant.\" I have one particularly vivid recollection of that meeting, for I did something I seldom do, and asked Miller for his autograph - to sign a copy, as it happens, of that same photograph that had hung in Menzies's office. The mutual friend laughed, not without reason, that a park-cricket plodder such as I should feel an affinity with such an image. Only after returning home did I peep at Keith's dedication. It reads: \"Good shot this. Try it some time.\" Perhaps it explains something about Miller's personality that just contemplating him makes me think I ought to.
