The business, energy and industrial strategy (Beis) committee said the competition watchdog \u2013 which is due to release its final recommendations for reform of the audit industry \u2013 should consider the break-up of the country\u2019s biggest accountants by separating their audit and consulting arms. Between them, the four big players \u2013 KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY \u2013 conducted the audits at all but one of the UK\u2019s 100 biggest listed companies last year. \u201cThe big four\u2019s dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on,\u201d Rachel Reeves MP, the Labour chair of the committee, said. \u201cOur report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.\u201d The committee suggested imposing market share caps on the big four and bringing in joint audits conducted by a big four player and a challenger firm. The latter proposal is already supported by the Competition and Markets Authority. Reeves said the big four were also often using their audit work as a route to \u201cmilking the cash-cow of consultancy business\u201d. The CMA has already proposed splitting the audit and consulting at an operational level but has stopped short of recommending a full separation. But the Beis committee\u2019s report, The Future of Audit, argued for a \u201cfull structural break-up\u201d of the big four. A break-up would be more effective in \u201ctackling conflicts of interest\u201d and providing the \u201cprofessional scepticism\u201d needed to deliver high-quality audits, the committee said. \u201cWe must not wait for the next corporate collapse,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cGovernment and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension holders and the public expect. \u201cChange is needed to deliver for investors, workers and the public. The big four may not like it, they may seek to undermine the case for reform, but vested interests should not be allowed to get in the way of positive change.\u201d However, the British business lobby group, the CBI, accused MPs of being \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and warned that \u201crushing to simplistic\u201d changes would damage the UK\u2019s reputation. \u201cThe committee\u2019s idea to force a break-up of the big four jumps the gun,\u201d Josh Hardie, the CBI\u2019s deputy director-general, said. \u201cIt puts forward a heavy-handed solution rather than waiting for the evidence of the reviews investigating the state of the current market and future vision for audits. \u201cBusinesses are aware there are problems with the audit market and it is a tough challenge to fix them. High-profile corporate failures have rightly prompted searching questions. But the UK\u2019s position as a stable, evidence-based country is already under threat. So rushing to simplistic measures rather than following a clear, considered long-term approach will damage our reputation further.\u201d PwC warned that breaking up the big four would weaken resilience, increase costs and damage the UK\u2019s global competitiveness. \u201cWe recognise the need for reforms which will enhance audit quality; however, the report\u2019s recommendation to break up the largest firms risks hampering, rather than enhancing it,\u201d Hemione Hudson, PwCs head of assurance, said. \u201cArguing for \u2018break-up\u2019 sounds like action, but actually it will reduce quality, weaken resilience and distract attention from more practical steps to ensure auditing keeps pace with society\u2019s expectations. \u201cThere are likely to be significant unintended consequences from breaking up the large professional services firms, with increased cost and disruption to the economy and businesses which would be damaging to the UK\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d A separate review, carried out by the Legal &amp; General chair, Sir John Kingman, will lead to the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), being abolished and replaced with the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. An FRC spokesperson said: \u201cThe FRC shares a number of the concerns expressed in the select committee report which are consistent with the evidence we submitted to its inquiry. Long-term fundamental changes to the regulation of audit form part of the implementation programme we are developing with Beis.\u201d Liz Murrall, the director of stewardship and reporting at The Investment Association, which represents asset managers, welcomed the Beis commitee recommendations. \u201cInvestors rely on the quality and robustness of audits when making investment decisions, and a high-quality audit is vital to ensure that the markets have confidence in the information in a company\u2019s annual report,\u201d she said. \u201cThe recommendations outlined in today\u2019s report are an important step in achieving this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
