Praying for Australia at the evangelical Christian event with his wife, Jenny, Morrison addressed the government\u2019s growing internal debate about religious freedom by arguing that culture was more important than laws. The prime minister told the conference the government would \u201cdo what we need to do from a legislative point of view\u201d, according to a news report in Eternity that Morrison\u2019s office confirmed was an accurate reflection of his comments before the 21,000-strong crowd on Tuesday night. \u201cBut what all that boils down to is the culture in this country,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the laws that make freedom of religion work, it\u2019s the culture that accepts it. \u201cSo I speak about my faith \u2026 because I want everyone in this place to feel comfortable talking about faith in this country. It\u2019s not a political agenda, it\u2019s who we are.\u201d Morrison said while freedom of belief in Australia was fundamental, Christians needed to prioritise love over judgments and lectures. \u201cThat\u2019s what we all need. That\u2019s what our country needs. That\u2019s what our nation needs. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do as Christians. Not here to judge. Not here to lecture. Just here to show the amazing love of God. \u201cMy job is the same as yours: love God, love people. We\u2019ve all got the same job.\u201d He suggested the religious freedom debate was too rights-orientated. According to the report in Eternity, Morrison referenced the conditions faced by missionaries in Soviet Russia. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear stories about them complaining about their rights \u2026 They were just loving in that situation and they were out there for God. That was their response and this country needs more love and less judgment.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison prayed for veterans, young people battling suicidal ideations, Indigenous communities, people with disabilities and for rain to break the drought. \u201cOur nation needs more prayer, and humility of leadership, and the wisdom to see what He sees and to move towards that,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd to have grace. Grace really is amazing. \u201cSomeone really should write a song about that!\u201d Morrison, who worships at the Horizon church, has attended the Hillsong conference for years. His attendance this year comes as Coalition conservatives campaign for a religious freedom bill, in a drive given additional fuel by the heavily publicised dispute between Israel Folau and Rugby Australia, triggered by a social media comment from Folau that asserted that gay people go to hell. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has indicated that cases like Folau\u2019s would be captured by the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill. Porter told Guardian Australia this week that legislation will include a \u201cpowerful avenue\u201d for people of faith who face \u201cindirect\u201d unfair treatment. But Porter is holding firm against calls from conservative MPs to establish a religious freedom act, saying such legislation could see \u201csensitive public policy\u201d determined by the courts as it adjudicated competing rights. The latest Guardian Essential poll suggests Coalition MPs are more enamoured with a legislative fix than Coalition voters are. The poll indicates only 44% of Coalition voters would back a proposal like the one now being sought by a group of rightwingers in the government, and support for the idea across all the voting cohorts is even more tepid, with only 38% backing the move (16% strongly and 22% somewhat). While the poll suggests Australians are reluctant to codify freedom of religious expression, the latest poll also indicates Australians feel constrained in what they can say and are concerned about the capacity of employers to dictate behaviour outside working hours. A majority, 64%, agree that people now hesitate before saying what they really think because they are afraid of how others will react, and a majority, 58%, agree that employers should not have the right to dictate what their employees say outside of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
