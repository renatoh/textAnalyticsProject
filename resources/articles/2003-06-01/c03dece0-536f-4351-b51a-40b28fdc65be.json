The New York Times, in its threshing emotions and heedless hatreds, seems to be saying: Yes, Yes, Yes!!! It is showing us all how to make a mountain out of a dunghill. For what did a 27-year-old black reporter called Jayson Blair actually do? He invented some quotes and concocted some stories over 18 months. Nobody on the outside - the readers - seemed to notice. Nobody on the inside got very pro-active either. Then he went too far, almost certainly deliberately, and pirated a story from a reporter in Texas who knew him well. Whistles were duly blown. He went into hospital and thence into the arms of a literary agent who may or may not make his fortune. But he is, in every way, damaged goods. Is that the end of the journalistic world? Only if you let it become so. Stuff happens. Lessons are learned. Organisations move on. There is no reason in logic or commonsense why this small drama should have unseated the Times' new editor, Howell Raines, or his black managing editor, Gerald Boyd. Nor why the ludicrously overblown follow-up saga of Rick Bragg, the Pulitzer Prize-winner, who let uncredited junior reporters and freelances do his legwork., should have intensified the crisis. No reason at all .... except for an amazing swill of self-importance, fear and loathing. Joe Lelyveld, the retired editor brought back to mind the shop, was an emollient, easy-going man. He hired Blair (but nobody seems to remember that). Howell Raines is a tough, hard-driving editor. He promoted people he rated and sidelined or retired some he didn't. A necessary arrogance? Perhaps - but also a weakness in a paper so full of its reputation, and resistant to simple authority, as The Times. Blair and Bragg together gave the staff a stick to beat Raines with. He wilted. The certainty was gone and so, it seems, was the will to fight back. Only this week they were saying that they never saw him in the newsroom any longer. He and Boyd couldn't make their writ run. They were victims of the precise crisis they couldn't cope with: a crisis of their own confidence. And now? A little Lelyveld balm? A wiping away of the tears and a return to office toil rather than office frenzy? Perhaps - although the management who stood by Raines and vowed to defend him is still there. You?d be crazy to declare this nervous breakdown over. For this is a story in which the storytellers became the story itself, and the limelight has its own malignant, self-fulfilling allure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
