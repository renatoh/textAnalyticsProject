Hazel Blears, the new communities secretary, and David Cameron clearly think that it is. At the Local Government Association conference yesterday both lavished praise on decentralisation. \"I stand before you as a convinced localist,\" said Mr Cameron. \"My whole political approach... is anchored in localism and devolution,\" said Ms Blears. The shared assumption is that decision-making is more legitimate, and more trustworthy, if it is done locally. They are both certainly right that the British state is too centralised and too hard for people to influence. But they also think that breaking things up will allow people to feel more engaged. Are they right? In an urbanised, industrialised, digital society, residency is only one of many factors that shape people's identity. Where people work, their cultural interests, their religion and even the pastimes that they enjoy can create communities of interest that are as strong as those created by the accidental factor of where they happen to live. Devolution to localities is easy to arrange: councils, wards and neighbourhoods can be given neat boundaries, and new structures. Ms Blears proposed some yesterday when she set out worthwhile ideas on increasing community engagement by allowing people to decide how money is spent. But her plans also stem from a very traditional idea of identity. Born in Salford, educated in Salford, a councillor in Salford and now MP for Salford, Ms Blears is a politician with the deepest of local roots. Not everybody feels so closely connected to a local geographic community. Mr Cameron has seized upon localism as one of the answers to Britain's over-mighty state. In his speech yesterday he called for an extension of elected mayors. But even as he spoke his party was struggling find a candidate for next year's London election. Boris Johnson, now being suggested, is a clever and comic man. But his candidacy, if it happens, would have sprung from national fame, not local identity. Most of the talk is about redistributing powers that local people already have. Ms Blears did not list the powers she wants central government to surrender to town halls. Nor did she offer to cut the financial ties that have long allowed central government to control local authorities. Until that happens - and politically and practically it would be hard - the new localism will always be limited. In an age when people are less likely to define themselves in terms of class or party, and where such allegiances are becoming weaker, it is tempting to think that locality is a firmer basis for collective decision-making. In practice, it may prove as fluid as everything else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
