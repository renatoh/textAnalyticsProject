A big subject, and one she clearly hasn\u2019t exhausted, given that its follow-up, Pacific, harps on the same string. But from a new angle: this one draws on her relationship with fellow standup Catherine Bohart, in which Keyworth finds herself defaulting to the traditional male role. Or failing to do so, which frustrates her \u2013 and she\u2019s not sure why. Her reflections on the subject are thoughtful and fresh: she delivers them wearing the expression \u2013 and speaking in the deliberative tones \u2013 of a woman who\u2019s still puzzling it all out. On one level, the show tugs on a well-worn strand of humour, as Keyworth plays henpecked \u201chusband\u201d to a high-maintenance wife, meekly accepting her role as part-doormat, part-dog. On another, it\u2019s filled with novel thinking on how to divide roles and responsibilities in a same-sex relationship, particularly given Keyworth\u2019s ambivalent feelings about masculinity, toxic and otherwise. Should she be proud when \u2013 like a man \u2013 she barely notices being low-level sexually harassed? Should she be ashamed when \u2013 unlike a man \u2013 she cries all the time? As she teases out the answers with reference to a recent break-in, her partner\u2019s hoarding habit, and her sex therapist granny, it\u2019s a pleasure to tune in. It might be a greater pleasure were she to vary the tone or intensity a little \u2013 while the occasional familiar-feeling routine (her dad\u2019s ignorance of pesto; the \u201cwhich side of the bed do you sleep on?\u201d chat) dilutes the novelty. But Pacific remains a strong sophomore offering from one of comedy\u2019s most engaging new voices. \u2022 At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
