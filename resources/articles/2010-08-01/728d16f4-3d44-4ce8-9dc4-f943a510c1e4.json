The story said that in 1981 people typically received the pension for 25% of their lives. By 2000 this figure had risen to 30%, and by this year to 33%. To clarify: these figures refer to a proportion of adult life, which is defined as being from 18 onwards (State pension age must rise to 72, says thinktank, 21 August, page 37). \u2022 The source of a quote from a sister-in-law of Binyamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, was cut, during the editing process, from a report on Jerusalem's new light railway (Jerusalem rail firm wants gender divide, 24 August, page 15). We should have made clear that Ofra Ben-Artzi was talking to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. \u2022 We said that Ed Balls is to support a new campaign by the Communications Workers Union against privatisation but we did not say that the campaign is for the Royal Mail (Burnham launches blitz on 'metropolitan elite', 23 August, page 4). \u2022 Wotan did not leave Br\u00fcnnhilde on the mountainside to burn alive as we asserted in our report from Bayreuth on Katharina Wagner (The battle for Bayreuth, 24 August, page 19, G2). He created a ring of fire to protect his daughter while sleeping, until a worthy hero should come to wake and liberate her. In addition, the surname of Katharina Wagner's sister is Wagner-Pasquier and not Pasquier-Wagner as we reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
