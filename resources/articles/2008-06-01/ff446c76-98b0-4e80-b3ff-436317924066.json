The city's eight-minute presentation will feature ballet, hip hop and contemporary dancers and will include performers from the Royal Opera House, street dance theatre ZooNation and CandoCo, a company which specialises in mixing performers with and without disabilities. The handover ceremony, which will take place on August 24 in Beijing's Olympic Stadium, will commence with Mayor Boris Johnson receiving the Olympic flag. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe explains: \"He will wave the flag six times and when he does so, the eyes of the world will then move to London, and we have that large and collective sigh that goes out, 'Oh, my goodness, it's London's turn next.' In what was the new mayor's first Olympic-related news conference since defeating Ken Livingstone in the mayoral elections last month, Johnson dominated a briefing about plans for the ceremony and plans to mark the occasion in London. \"When politicians try and sum up the essence of Britain, they almost always come a cropper,\" Johnson said. \"It's a huge relief to all politicians involved in this that this immensely demanding artistic challenge of devoting the genius of the city and this country in eight minutes has been met through ZooNation, CandoCo and the Royal Opera House. It's going to be absolutely brilliant \u2014 I can't tell you exactly what's involved because we'd all have to be liquidated afterwards. I can tell you it's going to be remorselessly and cheerfully symbolic of our country.\" Details of the rest of the handover ceremony have been kept under wraps. \"We're still refining the plan,\" said Bill Morris, London 2012's director of culture, ceremonies and education. \"We are not going to reveal any more of the plans today. The three dance troupes ... are certainly an anchor throughout the performance, but it's not the only element.\" However, it is known that people are expected to congregate in The Mall adjacent to Buckingham Palace, where giant screens will be specially erected for the event. The closing ceremony will then be followed by a free concert, which the BBC will broadcast on both television and radio. Morris said further details of the concert would be revealed closer to the event, which will be held on the same weekend as London's Notting Hill carnival. Those outside London will also be able to watch the ceremony on giant screens, as similar events are planned throughout the country, whilst local councils will be encouraged to display special handover flags on Aug. 24 that are Union Jack inspired versions of the London 2012 logo. \"I am suspicious of any state-sponsored effort to promote or encourage any mood of national euphoria but I do think when you look at what is in store for us in August, I do think it will be a fantastic party,\" Johnson said. The same three dance troupes will also be involved in the closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games on Sept. 17. \"In essence, it is the same show,\" Coe said. \"We are integrated.\" Previous handover ceremonies have featured Australia's contemporary Aboriginal dancers, whilst China chose to mark their segment at the Athen's closing ceremony with a choir from Beijing university."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
