With Arsenal and Chelsea beating Birmingham and Reading respectively, and Manchester City playing Brighton in the final last-eight tie on Thursday night, United will get their first taste of life at the top of the league they are aiming to be in next season. Stoney\u2019s side beat London Bees 9-0 in the Championship on Sunday, the heavy wins a regular feature of their season, but the United manager said that brings its own challenges. \u201cIt is difficult when you are winning games by the margins we are to keep the intensity high,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re relentless with our standards.\u201d West Ham, fielding the same XI that took the lead before losing 4-2 to Arsenal on Sunday, switched to a back three for the trip to Leigh, with Claire Rafferty and Ria Percival pushed further forward. However the reshaped side struggled to have an impact in the first half. Their manager, Matt Beard, said the changes were forced by trying to work around injuries. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing well with a 4-3-3 but we had too many players not in their natural positions so we changed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take responsibility for that. We\u2019re trying to get the best available players in their best positions but it\u2019s backfired on me tonight.\u201d The hosts started on the front foot and with Kirsty Smith, Alex Greenwood and the brilliant 17-year-old Lauren James linking well on the left it was not surprising the breakthrough came from there. James raced down the wing and sent in a dangerous cross and, in the scramble to get there ahead of Jess Sigsworth, Kate Longhurst stuck out a leg and poked the ball into her own net. Jane Ross, who scored twice on Sunday, was then brilliantly thwarted by Siobhan Chamberlain from six yards, leaving Stoney full of praise for her keeper. \u201cSiobhan makes a massive save at 1-0,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we go in 1-1 then it\u2019s a different game and it mentally tests us because we\u2019ve not been behind or level much. We switched off a little and she came alive, that\u2019s why I signed her, she knows how to keep herself in the game.\u201d Not long after the restart Beard, had his head in his hands. A goal-kick from Becky Spencer was knocked down for Longhurst who rattled the post with a half-volley from 30 yards. West Ham were left ruing their luck minutes later when Sigsworth smashed the ball into the corner after the visitors were dispossessed in the final third. Beard was fuming at the lack of a free-kick in the buildup. \u201cI\u2019ve been in to see them about the second goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say it was shoulder to shoulder but Longhurst has a mark on her back. At the end of the day he\u2019s given it and we have to recover as a team on the pitch and we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d United continued to look the more dangerous side but Percival smacked an effort against the foot of the post from distance as West Ham mounted a late push. \u201cThey\u2019re a WSL team. Every player on that pitch has been playing for WSL teams,\u201d said Beard. \u201cThey made the decision to go into the Championship and it\u2019s been a good decision for them. I watched their London Bees game and the fitness levels between the two teams was night and day and it\u2019s been like that most of the season.\u201d United go into the pot for the semi-final, just five months into their first season. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy team,\u201d said Stoney. \u201cWe won\u2019t be expected to win against any of them but what a challenge for these players. I can\u2019t wait. It will give us a true barometer of where we are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
