The grey\u2019s best performance to date was when winning a Listed race over a slightly longer distance on this course at Newmarket, back in 2015. Having won for them at Chester in May and then failed to cope with a quick return to the track, Restorer has been given a preparation that looks a lot like a build-up to this day. If I\u2019m right about that, he will surely shorten from his present odds of 50-1. Godolphin\u2019s Very Talented would be a more conventional choice and seems likely to fare well. 1.50 Newmarket John Gosden\u2019s fine recent record in the Royal Lodge is a pointer to Beatboxer but neither his pedigree nor the quality of his form justify the sort of price he\u2019s likely to be here. Arthur Kitt isn\u2019t certain to want this step up in trip, so Cape Of Good Hope appeals most. This brother to Highland Reel chased home Quorto in the Superlative, form that looks a lot better now. He should be better for the break he was given while his stable was wrestling with a virus. 2.05 Haydock I\u2019m in danger of following Al Erayg over a cliff but the ex-French runner gets one more chance from me here. There was promise in his first run for Tim Easterby, a \u201cnearest finish\u201d fifth at Chester and he ran well over too short a trip next time. He\u2019s well treated when things fall right. 2.25 Newmarket In light of her Morny success, taking on Pretty Pollyanna holds little appeal. She was well on top of Signora Cabello at the line that day, with daylight back to the rest, and it is hard to imagine her getting turned over if she can run to that level again. So Perfect is one that could have more to offer, if there is a danger in the field. 3.00 Newmarket Ten Sovereigns is the obvious one and he seems likely to prove a force at the highest level. Still, the available odds overstate what he has so far achieved and there is something to be said for the claims of his stablemate Sergei Prokofiev, who clearly failed to give his running in the Phoenix. Before that, he was a close third in the Coventry, form that entitles him to the greatest respect. 3.15 Haydock This is the time of year to catch Soie d\u2019Leau, four of whose five best efforts came in September or October. His first run for John Quinn, back in May, was his best for years and there have been a couple of excuses since then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
