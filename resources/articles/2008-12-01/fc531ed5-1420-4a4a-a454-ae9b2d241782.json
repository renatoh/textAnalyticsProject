I'm blue", "bodyText": "Red or white? The question is becoming crushingly familiar, heavy as it is with the assumption that you are a wine drinker. Sometimes, if you listen hard, you can hear the unspoken, \"\u2026 or something else?\" Which is not to say you cannot ask: \"Is a gin and something out of the question?\" But you know it is, even if you are told only in crude code: \"George! Have we got any tonic left from that party 20 years ago?\" or: \"There used to be a bottle of Gordon's somewhere, but I think the dog buried it in the garden.\" Recently, I was sufficiently emboldened by having anticipated a fizzing G&amp;T all one afternoon to offer to go and buy a tonic while my host rummaged for the green bottle. He tried to dissuade me by saying the nearest shop was miles away \u2013 we were in Hammersmith, for goodness sake \u2013 and then sent me on a tortuous route that no doubt avoided two or three stores nearer by. I got back to be told there was no gin. By now, though, I would have climbed Annapurna for my draft of spirits and so struck off on another serpentine expedition to an off licence. Some years ago I realised I had been sucked in to accepting that wine-only parties \u2013 dinner or otherwise \u2013 were all right. I dutifully imbibed it without really liking it. What specifically didn't I like about it? Well, for a start it tastes like, erm, grapes that have been scrunched up with their skins on and left lying about in a cellar. And then there's the wine hangover \u2013 after drinking moderate amounts it is so much worse than the after effect of a couple of good-sized gins or whiskies. If I had been drinking wine at lunch, the dull headache and lassitude would ruin the rest of the day; in the evening, the waking at 3am with a mouth drier than a maths master's blackboard chalk would ruin the rest of the night. The only wine conversation I remember with fondness is from Brideshead Revisited when Wilcox tells Sebastian Flyte and Charles Ryder that a lot of his Lordship's old wine needs drinking up. They dutifully oblige, and the dialogue soars brilliantly: \"\u2026 It is a little, shy wine like a gazelle.\" \"Like a leprechaun.\" \"Dappled, in a tapestry meadow.\" \"Like a flute by still water.\" \"\u2026 And this is a wise old wine.\" \"A prophet in a cave.\" No wine talk could possibly improve on this, so there is no point sitting about with a stemmed glass in your hand on the off chance that it might. One worse greeting than \"red or white?\" is the one offering a glass of champagne \u2013 or, stomach-pumpingly, \"Bubbles\" \u2013 which is even more emphatic in daring you to be so utterly vulgar as to ask for a Bloody Mary with loads of Lea &amp; Perrins and Tabasco. Champagne is one of those things you are not supposed to disapprove of \u2013 others include UN peacekeepers and sunsets \u2013 but it does all the nasty things that non-sparkling wines do to you, only quicker. Searching for evidence that spirits drinkers might finally be turning back the red and white tide was depressing. Typical of what I turned up is this market research: There is a new cosmopolitanism that has helped drive \u2026 the most outstanding feature of the UK drinks markets since the 1990s \u2013 the rise and rise of wine consumption. Value sales of wine in the UK are now larger than sales of spirits \u2026 driven by rising incomes, more 'aspirational' drinking habits, a trend towards home entertaining and by a massive promotional push. The popularity of wine among women has also helped drive this impressive market growth. I'm not sure which phrase is the most odious, but now that you know you are a new cosmopolitan suffering from an aspirational drinking habit \u2013 particularly you women \u2013 perhaps you will think about reforming the home entertaining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
