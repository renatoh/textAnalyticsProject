In fact there was also a baseball team called the New York Giants until they moved to the West Coast in 1958 and became the San Francisco Giants. Plimpton also played football and was accepted by the Detroit Lions, describing his experiences in his 1966 book Paper Lion, which became a film starring Alan Alda. The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday November 23 2003 We said in the article below that Paris Review founder and editor George Plimpton had 'pitched for the New York Giants'. This would have been impossible as the Giants are a football team, not a baseball team. So-called little magazines haunt the world of books like brilliant but needy friends, dazzling you with a poem or a story while in the same breath touching you for a fiver. The greatest little magazines can shape a generation of writing: Horizon in the Forties, the New Review in the Seventies, Granta in our own time. And however influential they are, however much they sponsor a vital originality, they also consume barrow-loads of rich men's patronage. Like love-affairs, little magazines have their own life-cycle and significance. A lot of them fizzle out after the second or third issue. The good, and the lucky, ones perhaps survive a decade. But in recent years only one has reached its golden jubilee. Issue no 167 celebrates 50 years of the Paris Review , described by Time as 'the greatest little magazine in history'. The Paris Review was conceived in the cafes of the Boul' Mich by three expatriate Americans (Peter Matthies-sen, H. L. 'Doc' Humes, and George Plimpton) and first published in 1953, a year that is both near and far, another world and yet still contemporary. That was the year of James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain , of Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March , of J. D. Salinger's Nine Stories, and the year Ernest Hemingway won the Pulitzer for The Old Man and the Sea . At the same time, Lawrence Ferlinghetti opened the City Lights Bookshop in San Francisco, Beckett's En Attendant Godot premiered on the Left Bank, and a young journalist on the Times called James Morris got the scoop of a lifetime from the top of mount Everest. Frank Sinatra's song that year was 'I've Got the World on a String'; Stalin died; and another magazine, Playboy , also celebrating its jubilee, was launched. The guiding principles of the Paris Review were, says editor George Plimpton, 'disarmingly simple': to devote the magazine largely to creative work (short stories, excerpts from novels and poetry) and to put the critical stuff, which tended to dominate literary magazines, at the back. Since then the magazine has published the first writings of an extraordinary gal\u00e8re of twentieth century writers, from Jack Kerouac to Philip Roth to Jay McInerney. The Paris Review would also track down and interview important writers, then print near-verbatim transcripts of the conver sation. The first to submit to this process was E. M. Forster who caused quite a flap by discussing frankly why he had been blocked since 1924. One of the few greats to elude Plimpton's net was Thomas Mann who, the story goes, actually died as the Paris Review interviewer knocked on his door. Since then, the Paris Review interview has become a much-imitated minor art form. A winning mix of exegesis and creativity, the Paris Review was a brilliant formula, and it has hardly changed in half a century. The jubilee edition contains penetrating interviews with Paul Auster and Jim Crace, a lot of poetry, some new fiction, and some archival snippets by writers as diverse as Richard Ford, Norman Mailer and Grace Paley. It is, as you might expect, a bumper volume. But the thing that makes issue 167 such a memorably bittersweet experience, and one to linger over, is that on 26 September, the day after reviewing the galley proofs, George Plimpton died of a heart attack in his sleep, aged 76. Plimpton was the Paris Review , a classic Bostonian, described by my colleague Andrew Anthony as 'the gadfly of American letters... a journalist, soldier, playboy, film actor, novelist, gossip, sports fan, biographer, ornithologist and all-round participant'. He was also the author of The Curious Case of Sidd Finch , one of the best comic novels of recent years, and undeservedly neglected. Every great little magazine has its presiding genius. Plimpton, an immensely tall, good-looking patri cian, was that genius, a gentleman amateur in the best English sense, whose ironical nonchalance infused everything he did with a rare and radiant joie de vivre. By the end of his fascinating life he had become an offbeat celebrity, a friend of presidents and a mixer who was never afraid to join a sports team (he pitched for the New York Giants), do stand-up comedy, play in an orchestra or take part as a film extra (his contribution to Lawrence of Arabia ended up on the cutting-room floor). 'There are people who would perhaps call me a dilettante because it looks as though I'm having too much fun,' he once said in a voice so elegantly aristocratic that it's said Martin Scorsese asked the cast of his film The Age of Innocence to speak like Plimpton. 'But I have never been convinced there's anything inherently wrong in having fun.' robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
