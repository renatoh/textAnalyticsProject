This year\u2019s awards, announced on Thursday, included a record showing for Indigenous writers and writers of colour, with the Gay\u2019wu Group of Women winning the non-fiction category for Songspirals; the Darug duo of Jasmine Seymour and Leanne Mulgo Watson winning in the children\u2019s category for Cooee Mittigar; and Omar Sakr becoming the first Arab Australian Muslim poet to be shortlisted \u2013 and then to win \u2013 in the poetry category for his book the Lost Arabs. Of the 40 shortlisted authors, nine were of Indigenous heritage. \u201cIn a year like no other, never has the diverse contribution of home-grown writers been so important to every one of us,\u201d Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement on Thursday. Morrison didn\u2019t appear at the ceremony, but spoke via pre-recorded video link; the awards were presented by arts minister Paul Fletcher. Winch\u2019s winning novel, the Yield, took a decade to write. It tells the story of August Goondiwindi, who returns to her home country of Massacre Plains for her grandfather\u2019s burial, only to discover that it\u2019s set to be demolished by a mining company \u2013 and that her grandfather had been composing a dictionary of Wiradjuri language that could prove the Indigenous community\u2019s claim to their own land. The book, which was selected as one of the Guardian\u2019s Unmissable books of 2019, melds narrative voices and historical fiction with a dictionary of Wiradjuri words, which Winch learned with the help of elders. \u201cThere\u2019s no elevator pitch for the book,\u201d she told the Guardian, after winning the Miles Franklin. \u201cIt\u2019s about language at its heart. It\u2019s about decolonising the tongue.\u201d In their comments, the judges for the Prime Minister\u2019s Literary award wrote: \u201cNever didactic, Winch carefully and lovingly brings to life the story of a fractured family and their fight to retain their culture, their language and their land \u2026 A lyrical and generous writer, Winch\u2019s prose shimmers through this extraordinary tale of cruelty, dislocation, love and resilience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really shocked and grateful by how much booksellers and readers have really embraced this book,\u201d Winch said in her acceptance speech, pre-recorded from her home in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s erased the distance, and all those borders all this year; I\u2019ve felt at home.\u201d Unfortunately the live-stream dropped out halfway through the event, cutting Winch and Sakr\u2019s speeches from the broadcast. The non-fiction category was shared by two books: Sea People: The Puzzle of Polynesia by Christina Thompson, about the history of Polynesian people and their migration; and Songspirals: Sharing Women\u2019s Wisdom of Country Through Songlines by Gay\u2019wu Group of Women. Songspirals was the result of a decade-long collaboration between five Yolngu women and three non-Aboriginal women; in it, they share \u2013 in both Yolngu language and English \u2013 five \u201csong spirals\u201d: ancient narratives of landscape that are sung to \u201cawaken country and make and remake the life-giving connections between people and place\u201d, while facilitating the passing of Yolngu knowledge and culture across generations. The judges praised Songspirals as marking \u201ca major contribution to our understanding of contemporary Indigenous culture\u201d which \u201cwill surely serve as a model for future [collaborative] projects\u201d between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. The theme of Indigenous language and cultural sharing was carried into the children\u2019s category, which was won by writer Jasmine Seymour and illustrator Leanne Mulgo Watson for their picture book Cooee Mittigar: A Story on Darug Songlines. The book \u2013 which describes itself as \u201can invitation to \u2018yana\u2019 (walk) on Darug country\u201d \u2013 introduces readers to Darug \u2018nura\u2019 (country), language and the seasons and, like The Yield, also includes a glossary, so young readers can learn a new language as they read. The judges called Cooee Mittigar \u201cmoving, informative, immersive, welcoming and potentially healing ... a love song to the natural beauty of wider Australia, and the proud traditions of its original inhabitants\u201d. The Australian history category was won by Tiffany Shellam for Meeting the Waylo: Aboriginal Encounters in the Archipelago. The book tells the story of three Indigenous men who, in the mid-19th century, were intermediaries between Phillip Parker King\u2019s expedition to Australia\u2019s north-west coast and the Waylo people who lived there. The book resulted from a close and critical reading of historical texts that Shellam \u201crefuses to take at face value\u201d, the judges said. \u201cShe looks beyond the Eurocentric cultural assumptions underpinning them to determine a more subtle understanding of the cultures both of the mediators and the Waylo.\u201d Omar Sakr won the poetry category for the Lost Arabs, which was described as a collection of \u201cvital, energy-driven poems\u201d that \u201cspeak with a clear and fearless voice, a voice that is often passionate and sometimes angry, but always lucid and warmly human. \u201cSome of [the poems] are grounded in rage, others in compassion and gentleness, but all of them acknowledge the complexities of their subject matter, and many of them are works of great subtlety and beauty.\u201d Accepting the award, Sakr said: \u201cFour years ago Peter Dutton remarked that it was a mistake for the Fraser government to allow Lebanese migrants into this country. Migrants that included my family. My presence here does not in any way ameliorate his comments, which were racist and offensive. But it does give me an extra bit of satisfaction to be here despite them.\u201d How It Feels To Float by Helena Fox won in the young adult category. The child protagonist of Fox\u2019s debut novel is Biz, who is living with grief and depression that she\u2019s attempting to overcome by pretending it isn\u2019t there. The judges called it \u201ca beautifully written, poetic and heartbreaking portrayal of grief, trauma, guilt and mental illness ... although confronting and hard to read at times, it is ultimately a book about hope, resilience and survival.\u201d Each category winner was awarded $80,000, with shortlisted authors winning $5,000 each. \u201cYour work helps to define who we are as Australian and articulate what so many of us feel but often struggle to put into words,\u201d Morrison said via video link. \u201cFor most of us this has been a very tough year. A book ... has been a welcome retreat to escape to another world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
