In The Misanthrope, his masterpiece, Moli\u00e8re seems to take this tension between a writer and his invented character as the point of departure for a whole play. Alceste, the play's hero, believes it's right to tell the truth whatever the circumstances; he was originally played on stage by Moli\u00e8re himself. When he finds that human beings don't meet his impossibly high standards, Alceste walks out. So we have the possibly unique spectacle of a writer walking out of his own play and, by extension, out of human society itself. Why? What is Moli\u00e8re/Alceste so angry about? In 1666, he's angry about the smug dilettantism of the courtly elite, and the appalling arse-licking conformity that even his closest friend indulges in. He's angry about sexual hypocrisy, social game-playing and insincerity. He's angry about the disguising of true feeling beneath masks constructed of language. And, above all, he's angry because the woman he loves just happens to be the star representative of most of the above. But as Monsieur de Moli\u00e8re (n\u00e9 plain old Pocquelin and not so indifferent himself to some personal rebranding) makes his way, in 2009, out of the Eurostar terminal and heads off down Judd Street, he has a sickening thought: what if his play has become irrelevant? Look around \u2013 this isn't a 17th-century society of patronage, elitism and conformity. It's a post-industrial matrix of vigorous individualism, liberal thinking and therapeutic confession. Instead of the oppressive dictatorship of Louis XIV, he discovers a remarkable democracy in which nearly every man and woman can vote (incredible!) for whichever political party (and there are many!) represents their personal desires. As for people's feelings, these are hardly ever disguised. On the contrary: when he checks into the Covent Garden 100% smoke-free Travelodge and turns on the TV, he finds special reality entertainments in which contestants sexually and emotionally hide nothing at all. Amazing \u2013 but at the same time worrying: how can his play The Misanthrope have any purchase on a world of such egalitarian transparency? Where is the cultural space for his hero's disaffection, if the 21st century is a sunny playground of consumer choice? When I meet him the next morning, he's not happy. He hasn't slept, he put the wrong size cup under the hotel coffee machine and hot milk spewed over the edge into the slop tray. He's experiencing the self-pity that we writers prefer to call suffering or despair. \"What's wrong?\" I ask. \"I'm worried, Martin. I'm worried about the play. It's not going to work. The world's so different now.\" I try to reassure him. I explain that, however attractive it may seem in theory, a democracy like ours has its flaws: I could vote my whole life for a party that is never once elected, and yet the state will still go on claiming to represent my will. Scratch at our egalitarian facade, I say, and you'll discover inequalities of means and wealth that even Louis XIV would never have dared contemplate. I point out that the doctrine of choice \u2013 now poisoning the provision of health and education \u2013 has been slyly advanced by commercial organisations to give the illusion that the products they market (the millions of cars, mobile devices and computers) have been \"chosen\" by individuals, rather than sold to them by global advertising. I bring a copy of David Cameron's conference speech to demonstrate how the emotional frankness of confessional TV can be repackaged and exploited for political gain. Lastly, because I can see Moli\u00e8re starting to flag and scratch at his wig, I explain how, in the 1960s and 70s, there was a brief moment when a counter-cultural agenda opposed the mainstream before being swept along by it, and how today's clamouring for \"choice\" masks a society of well-tamed conformists, whose addiction to media-driven fantasies of property and celebrity distracts them from their inability to shape their own lives. In other words, I say, there's still plenty for Alceste to be upset about. \"OK, OK,\" he says. \"So what are you suggesting?\" \"What I'm suggesting is that your play will certainly work, but it needs a rewrite. What's wrong?\" \"Forgive me, but I'm not confident about writing in English.\" \"Don't worry: I'll put it into English \u2013 but the important thing is that any new ideas come from you. Let's meet back here before rehearsals begin and see what you've come up with.\" A week later, I'm sitting opposite a transformed Moli\u00e8re: he's got rid of his wig and mastered the coffee machine. \"OK,\" he says, \"here's the pitch. Let's make Alceste fall in love with Jennifer, an American film star, whose shameless manipulation of her powerful friends, strategic sexual provocation and delight in malicious chatter makes her, like The Misanthrope's C\u00e9lim\u00e8ne, represent everything he most hates. \"Furthermore, let's make this Jennifer not just terrifyingly young but terrifyingly self-possessed and intelligent, fiercely resistant to masculine control. Let's make her and her entourage significant players in the media-celebrity complex you described. Let's make her closest confidante a highly educated journalist, who turns out to be using their intimacy to obtain unguarded comment she can work into a scandalous feature; this will be a useful plot device. Let's have some good-natured fun \u2013 why not? \u2013 at the expense of critics, and even be rude about one or two of your most sacred playwrights. \"Finally, let's make Alceste a writer, Martin, like yourself. Let's give him some of the anger and eloquence you so impressed me with. But let's also \u2013 and please don't be offended \u2013 let's also reveal his slightly ridiculous side.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I'm just saying I want his earnest quest for honesty to seem maybe a little \u2013 what's the word? \u2013 outmoded. And his 'love' for Jennifer oppressive. Because you keep telling me how flawed and shallow your society is, but the fact is, Martin, I'm starting to enjoy it. I like consumer goods and fashion and texting my friends. And what's so wrong with aspiring to be rich and famous? You criticise your democracy, but you don't offer an alternative. It seems to me your critical passion is simply window-dressing for something more profound: a dangerous disdain for human nature.\" \"Disdain? Meaning what exactly?\" \"Look, what I'm saying is that, deep down, there has to be something disturbing about Alceste. He's more than just a critic: any half-baked blogger or columnist can let off steam like a screaming kettle. No \u2013 Alceste is more extreme than that. He's a man whose uncompromising view of human beings means he is incapable of living with them. That's what being a misanthrope really means. And that, Martin, is why you have to walk out at the end.\" He looks at me. \"Have I said something funny?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
