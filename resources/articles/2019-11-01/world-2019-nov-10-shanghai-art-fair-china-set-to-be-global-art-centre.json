I could never do that now: there\u2019s too much competition. They all want to break the market.\u201d The focal point of activity in China is Shanghai, which last week hosted the November art week, a host of art and design fairs and the landmark inauguration of the Centre Pompidou x West Bund Museum Project: a five-year partnership that sees the latest iteration of the Paris behemoth housed in a 25,000 sq-metre building designed by the British architect David Chipperfield. Shanghai is known for its dynamism but the buzz last week was particularly intense. According to the analysis of members of the global art community, the city is not just having a moment, it is changing the art world order. Currently the world\u2019s third largest art market, after the US and the UK respectively, and with more ultra-rich citizens than the US for the first time, China looks set to become the greatest art market of all, and Shanghai is fuelling this shift. Of course, there are caveats to the prognosis, not least the bothersome matter of how to reconcile art with the repressive Chinese state. But the general feeling among western gallerists seems to be that this is China\u2019s century. \u201cThere are some macro-economic and bureaucratic factors that have to be ironed out,\u201d says Nick Buckley Wood, the Asia director at Thaddaeus Ropac gallery. Buckley Wood is half-Chinese, grew up between London and Hong Kong and lived in Shanghai for five years. \u201cIf political tensions increase and the government continues capital controls on transferring money out of China, it\u2019s an issue. VAT was actually lowered this year, as was art tax last year, but it\u2019s complicated, and the rules change all the time.\u201d Shanghai\u2019s buoyancy, in light of these concerns, as well as issues of censorship and a sense that government controls are increasingly heavy-handed, is all the more remarkable. Art week sprang up around the openings of two museums founded by local contemporary art collectors, the Long Museum (2012) and the Yuz Museum (2014), coupled with the launch of two fairs, Art021 in 2013 and West Bund Art &amp; Design the following year. It has evolved into a major art world fixture with all the frantic activity of the best international art fairs and biennales. There is even an outpost of the Parisian nightclub Le Baron, which pops up at Art Basel Miami Beach and has become a louche signifier of substantial art world presence. Last week\u2019s launches included that of a new fair, Unique Design Shanghai, the first platform dedicated to collectable design in China, as well as 23 exhibitions at museums and foundations and 24 gallery shows. The scene-stealer, though, was the Pompidou. Billed as \u201cthe largest ever cultural exchange and cooperation project between two countries\u201d, the extensive, multidisciplinary programme will also include the training of Chinese museum professionals in curating and conservations as part of a skills exchange. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, flew in to join Xi Jinping for the launch and was received with much fanfare. Macron\u2019s speech was \u201cvery Chinese in tone, with lots of metaphors\u201d, says Morgan Morris, co-founder of Unique Design Shanghai. Morris has worked between Paris and China for almost two decades and is one of the few westerners I meet this week to have learned Mandarin. Morris founded UDS with Thomas Shao, president of Modern Media, and the boutique fair is housed in the Tank Art Park, a spectacular group of five abandoned aviation fuel tanks converted by Beijing studio Open Architects. The Tank Park is a stone\u2019s throw from the Pompidou, the West Bund fair and a slew of museums in Shanghai\u2019s burgeoning cultural district that brings art, culture and technology together in a 10km-square, government-backed waterfront development. Both the Yuz and Long museums are there, and the Yuz has just announced a collaboration with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) and Qatar Museums in Doha, which aims to share \u201cart and ideas among the three cities\u201d. Four works did not make it past the censors in the Pompidou\u2019s opening exhibition, The Shape of Time, although the president of the Pompidou, Serge Lasvignes, claims to be sanguine for now. \u201cAlmost everything got through. It\u2019s the first time that they\u2019ve partnered with a foreign museum for this long, and that\u2019s huge. The dialogue can sometimes be difficult but we\u2019re working on it and on building mutual trust,\u201d he tells me. But he has also warned this can only go so far, telling The Art Newspaper: \u201cIf we cannot do interesting things any more in the relationship we have with the Chinese authorities, we\u2019ll stop.\u201d Lasvignes claims the Pompidou will not be tempted to self-censor, but Buckley Wood suggests that in order to work in China, the art world must think about content. \u201cThe government asks every gallery to submit a list of works, and that leads to self-censorship because it\u2019s pretty obvious what they won\u2019t like. Graphic nudity would be a problem, while a beautiful black and white photograph of a naked person would probably be fine. Someone self-harming would be a no-no, as would anything overtly political or religious. \u201cOf course, artists should be completely free to express themselves in their work, but there is a way of life in China that is different to ours: they value harmony and don\u2019t want to see work that is too uncomfortable.\u201d Of the 109 galleries participating in the West Bund fair, there are 28 newcomers this year, including the London gallerist Stephen Friedman. \u201cWe have just done a two-week pop-up show in Hong Kong and wanted to use our time in Asia, so we came to Shanghai, having made a research trip last year,\u201d he says. \u201cI am extremely impressed by the facilities, which are as good as, or better than, any international fair..\u201d Friedman\u2019s sales on opening day included several works by David Shrigley and Jonathan Baldock and a large painting by Luiz Zerbini for over $100,000. Every dealer I spoke to reported healthy sales, with Timothy Taylordeclaring this year\u2019s West Bund his most successful opening day at a fair for years. Taylor sold Frank Auerbach\u2019s Reclining Head of Julia, 2006, for \u201cover $700,000\u201d, two Armen Eloyan paintings \u201cfor $100,000 and the other a bit less\u201d, an Eddie Martinez sculpture for over $100,000, and another five pieces for up to $50,000 each. \u201cAnd this is over the first day and a half.\u201d Taylor has been coming to China for years. \u201cIt\u2019s all about building relationships. There is a word in Chinese \u2013 guanxi \u2013 which literally means \u2018relationships\u2019 and refers to the support networks and goodwill generated by cooperation.\u201d But During a party for an art exhibition at the Prada Foundation, in the former French Concession, a young Chinese journalist tells me she worries that the imposition of the western art canon on China smacks of \u201ccolonialism-lite\u201d. The next day, a couple of Brits are trying in vain to attract the attention of the sales team at the Tanks gift shop. A Chinese man with the air of a collector is watching and suddenly bursts out: \u201cIf you\u2019re western, you have no traction.\u201d But the people who have spent the most time here find constant points of connection, language barrier notwithstanding. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to Chinese people, even through a translator, they always laugh exactly where I\u2019m hoping they will,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI think we have far more in common that we realise.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
