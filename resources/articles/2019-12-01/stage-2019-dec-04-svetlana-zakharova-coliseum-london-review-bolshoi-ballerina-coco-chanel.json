Strings of pearls, cigarette held just so, lips pursed in a knowing half-smile. Zakharova\u2019s long limbs cut shapes as if with the sharpest dressmakers\u2019 scissors but Possokhov\u2019s ballet offers only a limited glimpse behind her implacable facade. We see Coco dancing in cabaret clubs, finding love and loneliness, and designing for the Ballets Russes, where the cast of Bolshoi dancers \u2013 Vyacheslav Lopatin is particularly good \u2013 enjoy themselves riffing on ballet history. It\u2019s a stylish stage, entirely in monochrome with archive film setting the early 20th-century scene. Choice quotes from Chanel herself open each passage and they\u2019re often more revealing than the dancing. It\u2019s impressive to watch Zakharova held aloft in ecstatic lifts by Jacopo Tissi or dramatically swinging her legs side to side, like the balls in a Newton\u2019s cradle, but it doesn\u2019t ultimately give much insight into the woman or her art \u2013 although the subtleties of characterisation may be drowned out by Ilya Demutsky\u2019s overblown music. Also on the bill is Mauro Bigonzetti\u2019s Come un Respiro from 2009, a self-consciously modern work of warping, unpretty poses that is regally balletic but not hugely sympathetic to the Handel score that inspired it. Despite the title, the choreography doesn\u2019t breathe with Handel\u2019s limpid music, nor dance over his rhythms. Bigonzetti\u2019s mild mocking of baroque ornamentation needs a playfulness to carry it off, rather than these dancers\u2019 haughty seriousness. But an honourable mention for the reinvented tutu that looks like a Slinky wrapped round a dancer\u2019s waist. Eat your heart out, Chanel. At the Coliseum, London, until 5 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
