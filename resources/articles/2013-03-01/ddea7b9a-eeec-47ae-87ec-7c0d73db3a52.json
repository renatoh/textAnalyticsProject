And a golden opportunity for Gorgeous George", "bodyText": "\u2022 Nobody expects Labour to have an easy time balancing the various demands in the area of equality. But even with that in mind, it does seem to be making a mess of taking back the eminently winnable seat of Dewsbury. The Tory Simon Reevell sits pretty there for now, but he only won by 1,500. Most think 2015 should be the end of him. But as things stand, 2015 could be a reasonable year for him, or a stellar year for George Galloway's Respect, because on Monday Labour's national executive pronounced Dewsbury an all-women shortlist constituency, flying in the face of repeated pleas from local activists and some councillors. With a significant Muslim electorate, local strategists felt the party's best chance was one of the prominent Muslim figures, such as council leader Mehboob Khan, or cabinet member Shabir Pandor. Some wondered about the prospects of a return by the area's former MP, Britain's first Muslim minister Shahid Malik. And the problem with all-women shortlists in areas of high minority population, they said, is that minority candidates almost never win. Letters were sent and a petition was collected, but still the NEC did what it did. Pessimists talk of a house divided and a needlessly uphill struggle. Still, the national executive knows best. \u2022 As Nigel Farage tightens his grip on Tory tormentors Ukip, meanwhile, many have reason to be concerned. Farage was not in charge when many of the motley crew representing his anti-EU party toddled off to Brussels. And he is not entirely impressed. There'll be a better selection procedure next time, he said recently, reflecting perhaps on two recent defections and Tom Wise being jailed for expenses fraud. \"Well, it couldn't be worse, could it?\" the leader said. And one wonders if his eye alights on Stuart Agnew, MEP for the East of England, who does seem to be a man of peculiar enthusiasms. Of late he and colleagues have been talking up the comparative virtue of white asbestos. Labour's Stephen Hughes MEP this week took proposals before the European parliament in Strasbourg, calling for removal of asbestos from public buildings by 2028. But Agnew's not having it. He has taken out ads in regional papers attacking those who \"vilify harmless white asbestos\". He does, of course, recognise the dangers of blue and brown asbestos. The argument rages on, but one wonders if or how much Farage appreciates his party's Ukip-for-white-asbestos campaign? Doesn't seem a vote-winner. \u2022 We have been here before, with cussed types insisting that concern about white asbestos is a fuss about nothing, and accusing those who talk about dangers of running a scare campaign. The Mail was forced to end an article to that effect in 2010. In 2009, Geoffrey Podger, chief executive of the health and safety executive, wrote to the Telegraph. \"White asbestos is implicated as a cause of both lung cancer and mesothelioma, though uncertainty remains about the precise nature of how the risk changes at different levels of exposure,\" he said. \"It cannot be called safe by any sensible person.\" And yet here we are. Who do you believe, him or the man from Ukip? Another day, another lesson in morality from Conrad Black. Despite new troubles over tax said to be owed, he has been pointing the finger as part of a belated tribute to the former US president Richard Nixon. \"Nixon never accepted a fee for a speech (nor did Truman, Eisenhower, or Johnson),\" he says, endorsing an article by rightwinger Taki. By contrast, Clinton and Blair and the Bushes \"enriched themselves in consideration of their former offices\" in ways, \"to say the least, unseemly\". At least they left office first, Conrad. \u2022 \u2022 Finally, a new face at the Vatican, and in relatively short order. And while defenders of the faith watched for signs in Rome, BBC staffers braced themselves for tumultuous changes in London. \"Please be aware that smoke may also be visible from the flue on the roof of Broadcasting House,\" staff were warned by email. A new face at the top there? No, just emissions from a backup generator. Still, it allowed them to feel part of an historic occasion. Shouldn't all major appointments be announced this way?
