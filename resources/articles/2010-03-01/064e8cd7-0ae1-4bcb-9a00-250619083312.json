Third place in the table was described by Martyn Thomas, chairman of the RFU's management board, as \"clearly disappointing\" but Johnson's position has again been confirmed until next year's World Cup and the futures of his assistant coaches also seem under little immediate threat. \"The RFU has consistently said that Martin Johnson will be England team manager through to the World Cup and that remains our position,\" said Thomas. \"In that role he has to have the freedom to appoint the coaching team he thinks will best support him and equally that position has not changed.\" Johnson reiterated yesterday that his coaches had done \"an outstanding job in difficult circumstances\". A fanciful newspaper report linking Sir Clive Woodward with an imminent return to Twickenham also prompted the RFU to stress Andrew's job was safe for the moment. \"Contrary to assertions in some media, there is no planned review of the elite department or the wider RFU in July following the summer tour,\" insisted Thomas. Andrew, for his part, brushed aside suggestions from his former colleague Dallaglio that he was not doing enough to reverse England's fortunes. \"Lawrence is entitled to his views but I'm very comfortable with the job I'm doing and what we've done in the last three years.\" England's dismal performances in Rome and Edinburgh seem to have been all but airbrushed from the debate, the improved display in Paris on the final weekend having convinced the management board that Johnson is back on track. They were significantly less generous with his predecessor Brian Ashton, sacked after reaching a World Cup final and finishing second in the 2008 Six Nations, but Johnson is adamant his side are improving. \"No one has ever said it's good enough and we've not been happy with where we are. But there are things happening off the pitch that you can't necessarily see on it.\" Johnson also defended his low-risk selection policy and reserved scorn for those, including his former World Cup-winning colleague Josh Lewsey, who have questioned the credentials of his forwards coach John Wells. \"I think he's a fantastic coach and I see him coach every day. You see criticism and you think: 'What the hell do you know about it, what's your knowledge based on?' I don't think it's particularly ex-players having a go at the coaching staff, I just think it's become the thing in English rugby to criticise people. Coaches may sometimes get something wrong, but a lot of the time it's player error.\" Nevertheless, the bulk of the Six Nations squad are also poised to tour Australia and New Zealand in June, fitness permitting. Johnson is keen to give game time to fringe squad members such as Shontayne Hape, Jordan Crane, Steffon Armitage, Ben Youngs and Matt Banahan, rather than experimenting with lots of uncapped players in the three midweek fixtures. \"If I made changes it would pacify you guys but our issues as a team would still be the same. You're also trying to help the players build trust in themselves and us as a team. You don't do that with knee-jerk reactions to every little bit of criticism. The trust that's built between the coaches and the players is better than it ever has been.\" Johnson hopes the two Tests against the Wallabies in Perth and Sydney will bear him out but accepts that international management is a results-driven occupation. \"If I don't do a good enough job ultimately I won't be here very long. I understand that, that's the way it should be. We probably got things wrong at times in the Six Nations and I'll put my hand up to that. We're under no illusions about where we are and what we need to improve on but we've got a good foundation. The truth is always a bit more boring than you guys want to write.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
