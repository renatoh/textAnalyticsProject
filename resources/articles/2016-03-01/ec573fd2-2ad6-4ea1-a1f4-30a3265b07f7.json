The Workers Party figurehead \u2013 who earlier this month was briefly detained and questioned over corruption allegations \u2013 said he and President Dilma Rousseff were fighting an attempted coup by opponents who are using trial by media to try to convict them in the court of public opinion. The constant attacks, he argued, were an assault on democracy and had made governing Latin America\u2019s biggest nation so difficult that the economy was sliding towards \u201cparalysis\u201d. \u201c\u2018Coup\u2019 is the correct term to define what is going on this country,\u201d he said, comparing the current events in Brazil to past moves to unseat the leaders of Paraguay, Honduras and Venezuela. \u201cFor a leader to govern, they cannot be preoccupied with day-to-day survival. It\u2019s bloodshed every single day. [And this is supported by] a part of the Brazilian media [that] helps to worsen the environment of hatred on the streets of this country.\u201d Following a similar event by Rousseff last week, Lula was speaking to a group of about 30 foreign media journalists in S\u00e3o Paulo. It appears to be an attempt to circumvent what the ruling party sees as a hostile domestic press at the start of what looks set to be another week of intense pressure on the Workers Party administration. On Tuesday, the biggest party in Congress \u2013 the Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) \u2013 are expected to vote to leave the coalition, which will weaken Rousseff\u2019s ability to fight off an impeachment push by her opponents. Later in the week, a supreme court judge will rule on whether Da Silva is allowed to rejoin the cabinet. Tourism minister Henrique Alves, a member of the Democratic Movement, submitted his resignation late on Monday. Alves, an ally of vice-president Michel, wrote to Rousseff in a letter: \u201cThe dialogue, I\u2019m afraid to admit, has exhausted.\u201d The pressure is likely to grow. The PMDB has reportedly already prepared alternative policies, including welfare cuts, that it would implement in the event of Rousseff being impeached. Da Silva said it would be sad if the longtime ally left the ruling camp, but he hoped that the government could secure enough support from individual members to sustain a coalition. Lula, as he is popularly known, was detained and questioned on 4 March in connection with the Lava Jato investigation into a bribery and kickback scandal involving the state-run oil company Petrobras, major construction companies and dozens of politicians. Prosecutors said they were looking into allegations that the former president had received illegal benefits in the form of construction work done at two properties owned by friends or family. The judge overseeing the case, Sergio Moro, then authorised the leak of tapped conversations between him and Rousseff that showed the president had prepared a cabinet post for him. The motives for the appointment were not mentioned, but many interpreted this act as an attempt to give Lula extra legal protection and remove the jurisdiction from Moro because ministers can only be tried at the level of a higher court. Pressed on why he accepted the chief of staff position so soon after being detained by police, Da Silva said he wanted to push the government away from budget cuts and austerity and towards greater infrastructure spending and measures to improve consumer and business confidence. He said Rousseff had been trying to persuade him to join her cabinet since last year, but noted wryly that a court invalidated his appointment almost as soon as it was announced. \u201cIt was the shortest term of a chief of staff ever,\u201d he joked bitterly. Questioned about the leak, the former president suggested judge Moro \u2013 who has become extremely popular for exposing the rampant corruption among the political and business elite \u2013 had become carried away with his celebrity status. He also insinuated a \u201cproduction chain\u201d between elements of the police, prosecutors and the media. \u201cWe know there are selected leaks of information, but they are only against the PT,\u201d he said, referring to the Portuguese initials for the Workers Party. \u201cYes, we must fight corruption and investigate who took the money, but is it really necessary to make it a spectacle, to make it a Big Brother show?\u201d Taking the reality show reference a step further, he dared prosecutors to broadcast his next interrogation live because that would be better, he said, than having only selective parts leaked. From now on, he promised to produce weekly reports of misinformation in the media. The combative performance was part political self-defence, part counter-attack and part campaign speech for the next presidential election in 2018, when Da Silva has indicated he will run. Far better at communicating than Rousseff, his comments mixed anecdotes and humour. Lamenting how the atmosphere in Brazil has become poisoned, he said: \u201cSociety is very bitter. Everyone is in a bad mood, irritated, unbearable.\u201d Asked about the decline of leftwing governments in Latin America, he spoke with nostalgia of the time when he, Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Argentina\u2019s Nestor Kirchner were like \u201cMessi, Neymar and Suarez\u201d of FC Barcelona. Part of the reason for their current malaise, he suggested, was that the United States had been unhappy when Latin American nations created regional organisations without the superpower. For much of the press conference, he trumpeted the social gains of his time in office and warned passionately of the threat to Brazil\u2019s democracy with a reference to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Less convincingly, he failed to explain how he and Rousseff had managed over 14 years at the helm without noticing the huge corruption schemes that were funding the election campaigns of all the major parties. The Workers Party came to power in 2003 promising to clean up the endemic corruption associated with previous administrations. But since then two huge scandals have shown many senior party figures were sucked into dirty politics. Revelations of a massive vote-buying scheme in 2005, known as Mensal\u00e3o, led to the arrest of several prominent politicians, including Da Silva chief of staff Jos\u00e9 Dirceu. More recently, the Lava Jato investigation into money laundering and price fixing at Petrobras has exposed how billions of dollars were illegally diverted into campaign slush funds. Among those arrested or charged in a scandal that has inevitably been nicknamed Petrol\u00e3o are former Workers Party treasurer Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, and the PSDB leaders of the upper and lower houses of Congress. Lula said the Workers Party deserved credit for paving the ground for the investigation to go ahead by boosting the resources of the federal police, allowing prosecutors to choose the attorney general and enacting anti-corruption and freedom of information laws. One day, he said, historians would recognise that he, Rousseff and the Workers Party had \u201clifted up the carpet and shown what was underneath\u201d. He acknowledged the party had disappointed many of its supporters by breaking an election pledge not to impose austerity measures. \u201cPeople feel betrayed,\u201d he admitted. If judges allowed him into the cabinet, he promised to work to repair this damage, rebuild trust and tackle the division that plague Brazil. With Brazil in so much flux, it is unclear whether Da Silva will end the week in the cabinet or jail, as it is uncertain how far Congress will push the impeachment campaign against Rousseff. \u201cPeople should count to 10 because after a wrong decision things could get worse in this country,\u201d the former president said. \u201cThe last thing Brazil needs is more confusion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
