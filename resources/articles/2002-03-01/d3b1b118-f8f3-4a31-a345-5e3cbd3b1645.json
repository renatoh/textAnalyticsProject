No sooner has he marched his men up the steepest of hills than he is forced back down again and Saturday's Six Nations reverse in Paris has prompted a volley of criticism from England's most successful captain. Woodward will not lose much sleep about New Zealand knocking his side off the top of the Zurich world rankings after barely a fortnight but he could have done without yesterday's pointed attack by Will Carling, who insists Woodward is not the man to lead his side to World Cup glory next year. Under Carling England secured three grand slams in five years between 1991 and 1995, since when they have yet to repeat the trick. \"It is safe to say that if Woodward had been in charge of one of the southern hemisphere sides and had failed four years in a row in the Tri-Nations he would no longer be in his job,\" said Carling. \"Woodward has taken England a long way down the road to success and I have huge respect for what he has done, but I also have serious reservations about his ability to take us that last mile to turn the side into World Cup winners.\" Carling also accused Woodward of rushing Henry Paul into the team with indecent haste, saying it was \"blatantly unfair\" on Paul and \"stunningly disruptive\" to England's rhythm, such as it was in Paris. But Woodward's part in England's downfall was much less pivotal than some of his critics would prefer. True, he should have known that France would pore over the video of England's dazzling win over Ireland and construct their gameplan accordingly, but it was not Woodward who dropped the kick-off, failed to make the necessary forward yardage or conceded 15 turnovers. Neither did he pick the wrong starting 15 nor fail to warn his men of the French menace. After last October's defeat in Dublin, Woodward held his hands up to all kinds of misjudgments, but this time it was more a case of the players letting their coaches down. Whether some younger pack members, two of whom had never previously tasted defeat with England, fell into the trap of believing their post-Ireland publicity is a question for their consciences. Ditto the issue of whether Martin Johnson was affected by all the pre-match disciplinary ballyhoo, which resumes today with his appeal. As Will Greenwood pointed out, at least England played better than at Lansdowne Road when their 2001 grand slam went begging. Unfortunately, France were sharper and smarter. So where does this leave England? Once again their ability to change gameplans on the hoof is in question but they do have potentially another 20 Tests between now and the 2003 World Cup to address that deficiency. Of greater concern is Woodward's record of 12 defeats in 22 away games as the schedule for the next 18 months contains few of the big pressure Tests on foreign soil which separate the truly great teams from the flat-track bullies. This summer's tour of the south Pacific is still unconfirmed and, apart from a scheduled two-Test series in New Zealand in June next year when the All Blacks may choose to keep their powder dry, England will only be truly prised from their comfort zone on perhaps two other occasions. Still, at least after four missed grand slams their feet are firmly back on the ground.
