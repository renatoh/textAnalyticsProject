The National Education Union (NEU) said just 18 out of 533 constituencies would receive real terms per pupil funding increases next April, compared with 2015, even with the extra \u00a32.6bn announced by Boris Johnson. Of those, 13 are Conservative-held and include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s North East Somerset constituency. With education a key battleground in the general election campaign, the NEU, the UK\u2019s largest education union, has drawn up what it calls a constituencies league table for school funding to expose \u201cthe deep damage\u201d being done to England\u2019s schools. It concludes that schools in some of the most deprived areas will suffer increased budget pressures and cuts next year, despite the prime minister\u2019s promises. Of the 10 constituencies set to lose most, the analysis says nine are in London, where levels of funding have been higher because of deprivation. Of the 100 worst-hit constituencies, 77 are currently held by Labour, while overall Birmingham is the worst-affected city, where 99% of schools have a shortfall in funding and 89% face further real-terms cuts in April. The Conservative government said it would inject an additional \u00a314bn into schools from next year up to 2022-23, which would result in more money for every child in every school, with a minimum increase of 1.8% and far higher increases in some areas. But because there is no additional money until next April, the NEU says cash-strapped schools are having to make further cuts. Even with the extra funding, 83% of schools will have less money per pupil in April 2020 in real terms than they had in 2015, and children in 146 out of 149 local authorities will still be losing out. Kevin Courtney, the NEU\u2019s joint general secretary, said: \u201cSchool leaders are once again faced with the prospect of making impossible decisions just to keep afloat. Boris Johnson\u2019s promises on school funding will not fix the roof \u2013 it is too little, too late. \u201cSchools need a significant funding increase now, not the dribs and drabs promised from April 2020. Schools are losing support staff, dropping subjects, closing early, and cutting corners on basic maintenance, just to get by.\u201d According to NEU calculations, the worst-hit constituency \u2013 Dulwich and West Norwood in south London \u2013 faces a loss of \u00a3782 per pupil in real terms next April compared with 2015. At the other end of the table, York Outer, which is held by the Conservative Julian Sturdy, is likely to be the biggest beneficiary with a \u00a3138 gain. A total of 46 constituencies face a real-terms loss of more than \u00a3500 per pupil, of which 36 are Labour-held, including the seats of shadow cabinet members including Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington), Keir Starmer (Holborn and St Pancras) and Dawn Butler (Brent Central). \u201cOur constituency league table should send shockwaves through the country,\u201d said Courtney. \u201cThe future of education hangs in the balance. We need real solutions and in this general election we implore voters to scrutinise manifesto commitments closely.\u201d Luke Sibieta of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the NEU research was a fair representation of the picture up to 2020-21. \u201cThis analysis shows that most schools will have seen real-terms cuts in school funding per pupil between 2015 and 2020 once you account for confirmed school funding allocations and the likely costs faced by schools. \u201cFurther funding increases are already planned between 2020 and 2022, which should near enough reverse the picture of real-terms cuts over the last decade. However, this would still leave spending per pupil about the same level in 2022 as it was 13 years earlier in 2009. This represents a substantial squeeze on school resources as compared with recent history.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called for education cuts to be reversed in full and the introduction of a mechanism to ensure the education budget increases annually at least in line with actual school and college costs. \u201cThe next government must recognise that recent announcements over more funding for schools and colleges do not go far enough and the job is not done.\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said teachers and parents could not trust the prime minister\u2019s promises on funding. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives will only ever look after the privileged few \u2013 that is why pupils and schools in disadvantaged areas have quite deliberately been denied the extra funding they need, entrenching not tackling inequality.\u201d The Conservatives dismissed the NEU research as an inaccurate and misleading piece of political propaganda. Conservative MP David Morris said: \u201cThe reality is we are boosting schools funding by \u00a314bn over the next three years \u2013 meaning every pupil in every school will get more money, and funding across the country will be levelled up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
