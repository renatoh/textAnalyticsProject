Moyes, the West Ham manager, along with his assistant Stuart Pearce, the former Spurs striker Les Ferdinand and the former England Women\u2019s and current Brighton coach, Hope Powell, will all attend training at Bagshot before sitting down for a Q&amp;A session four days before Jones takes his side to Murrayfield. Jones has spoken recently of his admiration for how Moyes has set about rebuilding his career at West Ham following turbulent periods in charge of Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland after he had established his reputation at Everton. Jones has often called on football coaches previously, having arranged similar meetings with the Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, and Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola when he was with Bayern Munich. Gareth Southgate, the national manager, visited an England training session during the Six Nations last year. Jones often talks of how he utilises the training method of \u201ctactical periodisation\u201d, a theory described previously as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s best kept secret, and before the season he visited Newcastle United\u2019s academy, where he explained his keen interest in the sport. \u201cThe thing that really impresses me about football, which hasn\u2019t really happened in rugby so much, is that the players are individually highly skilled,\u201d he said. \u201cRugby has improved a lot \u2013 having been professional for only 20 years \u2013 but the skill level has not improved so much and that is something which really interests me.\u201d Jones has also been critical of how England\u2019s footballers have succumbed to a \u201cfear of failure\u201d at major competitions. England\u2019s rugby players flopped spectacularly at the 2015 World Cup but since Jones took over they have won 24 of their 25 Tests, clinching the Six Nations title for the past two years. \u201cI am sure there is a crossover in terms of sport science,\u201d said the hooker Jamie George. \u201cI know our sport scientists are very interested when [football coaches] come in, in terms of the GPS data they produce and how they measure the heart rate and all the rest of it. \u201cIt\u2019s anything with regards to what culture they are trying to produce, how they deal with setbacks. Whatever we\u2019re going through at the minute, anything we can learn from them, we\u2019ll take from them. [Footballers] are definitely under the microscope, they have to deal with a lot of pressure. Just like we do. There\u2019s a lot of hype around the Six Nations, that\u2019s a crossover you can find. I love meeting new people and trying to learn from those guys.\u201d George has fond memories of Murrayfield, having arrived off the bench during a 15-9 victory in England\u2019s first match under Jones in 2016. Four years before that, George was in the Murrayfield crowd for a friend\u2019s 21st birthday to watch his Saracens team-mate Owen Farrell make his Test debut. The question marks over Farrell\u2019s fitness after he and Joe Launchbury were absent from an open training session at Twickenham last week were removed when England declared a clean bill of health for the Scotland game. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to work with [Owen] day in, day out,\u201d George added. \u201cWe grew up together, we started playing together when we were 14. His maturity is the main thing that he\u2019s worked on. He\u2019d say himself that he was pretty raw when he first started international rugby but the way he\u2019s developed as a leader and as a player \u2013 he\u2019s showing that he\u2019s one of the best players in the world. We\u2019re very lucky to have him for club and country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
