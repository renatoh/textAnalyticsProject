Silbo", "bodyText": "It sounds a bit like the song of a blackbird played at about two-thirds of the proper speed. Earlier this week, the breathy, tuneful language of the Canary island of La Gomera was recognised as part of the world's cultural heritage. Silbo \u2013 from the word for whistle in Spanish \u2013 is thought to have about 4,000 words built from just four vowels and the same number of consonants in which pitch is a key part of meaning. It is now thought to be an adaptation of a much earlier whistling language imported by the island's first settlers, who probably came from north Africa. When Spain colonised the island in the 16th century the original settlers were driven to extinction, but the immigrants, known as Guanches, appreciated the benefits of an oral telegraph as an alternative to running up and down the island's steep valleys and craggy coastline. Silbo nowadays, the phonologists say, is closer to a version of Spanish than to an ancient African language. It has proved difficult to write, although the effort has been made; and as, say, a language of love, it has limitations. For the shepherds who use it, its main purpose is apparently to convey important instructions such as \"shut the gate\" \u2013 a bit like One Man and His Dog \u2013 but person-to-person. Greece, Turkey, China and Mexico all have a tradition of whistled languages. But in La Gomera 20 years ago it was down to the last gasp when the government put it on the primary school curriculum. Now 3,000 children know it, and every new generation will learn it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
