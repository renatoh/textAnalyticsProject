The Colombian striker completed his \u00a39.5m move from River Plate of Argentina yesterday, a transfer that will silence, at least temporarily, the fans' rising dissatisfaction with Ellis. But the Villa chairman, 77, is adamant neither age nor disgruntled supporters will force him to relinquish the job he has held for almost 20 years. \"I am chairman and I plan to remain chairman,\" he said. \"I have no intention of resigning. I am mentally alert, physically agile and can still take on anyone.\" Ellis's determination to continue suggests his tenure of office is in the lap of the gods but there is one decision that remains his: he wants Gregory to be at the club as long as he is chairman, despite reports of a serious rift between the pair. Tensions boiled over just after Christmas when Gregory humiliated his chairman by making personal criticisms of him in a Sunday paper. Yet during the inevitable dressing-down of the chastened Gregory, Ellis made it clear he wanted him to be a long-term fixture at Villa Park. \"The chairman repeated to me what he told me in May,\" Gregory said. \"He wants me to be the last manager to work under him at Aston Villa.\" Ellis hopes he has raised Gregory's chance of going the distance by sanctioning the signing of the 25-year-old Angel. \"We've backed John Gregory to the hilt on this signing in every respect,\" Ellis added. \"Payments for transfers can usually be spread but in this case we have had to pay cash and settle the account straight away. He chooses the players and he picks his team - there is no interference from us.\" Angel's arrival ends a six-month quest for a quality striker by Gregory, who now must hope a player he sees as the one to reignite Villa's season does not turn into an expensive flop. Despite Ellis's encouraging sentiments, Gregory's position must be tenuous after both his criticisms and his team's recent record. Villa have won only one Premiership game in the last 10 and with fixtures to come against Manchester United, Leeds and Ipswich he may be heading for the exit door come the end of the month. But Gregory is confident Angel can deliver - \"he can score goals of all kinds, tap-ins and spectacular ones. That's what he does. His recent record of 17 from his last 17 games speaks for itself and he is hungry for them. In one game I watched him, he had five shots in the first five minutes. \"He knows what is expected of him: he realises we've suffered in the past two seasons because we have not had someone to convert chances. He is confident he can put that right.\" Angel's arrival is set to threaten David Ginola's brief time at the club. Recently he has partnered Dion Dublin up front but, with Gregory favouring a 3-5-2 formation and Paul Merson excelling in the free role Ginola might otherwise occupy, the Frenchman may find himself sidelined. Ginola was substituted at half-time in Villa's dismal display against Liverpool on Saturday. \"I was very disappointed with him,\" said Gregory. \"The least I expect from any player is for them to come off at the end knowing they have given their all.\" With Angel ineligible to play in tomorrow's FA Cup replay against Newcastle Ginola may get another chance. But the newcomer is set to play a part at Old Trafford on Saturday. \"I've been on holiday since the Argentinian season ended just before Christmas so I am not fully match fit,\" said Angel. \"But I am very keen to get started and settled in England.\" Gareth Barry has started talks over a new contract with Villa. Gregory is keen to tie the central defender to a five-year deal that would keep him at the club until 2006. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
