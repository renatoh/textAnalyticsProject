They are a rag-tag crew of fantasists, losers and schemers whose heads are filled with crazy dreams. In the flat above lives a beautiful blonde whose flirtations threaten the gang's friendships and plans. It could almost be a 70s sitcom, were it not for the fact that in Living with the Infidels \u2013 a new comedy series launched on YouTube \u2013 the men are Bradford-based jihadists and their crazy dream is a murderous terror plot. The five-part series has been condemned even before it has been broadcast with relatives of those killed in the 7/7 attacks leading the criticism. Its writer and creator is 40-year-old Aasaf Ainapore, a former commercials director who was born into a Muslim family but says he is not himself a believer. Ainapore was inspired to make the series with his partner Kira-Anne Pelican after noticing how often the word \"bumbling\" was used to describe British would-be terrorists. \"If you read about the shoe bomber or the attempted attack at Glasgow airport there is something farcical about it,\" he says. Much of the comedy in Living with the Infidels is derived from the tensions between being both western and Muslim: the characters are torn between aiming for the 72 virgins that martyrdom will bring, or chancing their luck with Abi from upstairs. In the final episode the gang film a suicide video but are hampered when one member starts channelling his inner auteur and urges that they \"break down the fourth wall\" when filming. \"We're making a suicide video here, not some arthouse wank-romp,\" he is told. \"Don't knock it,\" he replies, \"I got plans for Sundance.\" Ainapore says he always intended that Living with the Infidels would be destined for the internet. \"I don't think any television broadcaster would be comfortable with what we are trying to do,\" he adds. Ainapore says he is interested in using the internet to \"build a brand\" for his work but he flatly denies that in choosing such a provocative subject matter he is exploiting the issue. What did he make of the criticism of those such as Veronica Cassidy, whose 22-year-old son Ciaran died in the explosion on the Piccadilly line, and who said of the series, \"If it happened to one of their children, would they be as keen to put something like this on YouTube?\" \"I am acutely aware that anyone affected by the events of 7/7 would be anxious about the series,\" he says, \"but I truly believe that it is only by ridiculing these extremists that you can hope to persuade young Muslims to turn against radicalism.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
