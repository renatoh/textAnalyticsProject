The FTSE 100 closed down 170.4 points at 6120.8, a 2.71% drop. The decline accelerated during the afternoon as Wall Street opened sharply lower, partly hit by a Goldman Sachs sell note on Citigroup. Goldman estimated that its rival may have to write off $15bn in bad debts stemming from the US sub-prime turmoil. Investors were also nervous about a US consumer slowdown ahead of the crucial Thanksgiving shopping weekend, after the DIY chain Lowe's cut its profit forecasts. Back on this side of the Atlantic, Northern Rock slumped to a new low of 104.2p, down 28.4p, as the bank made it clear that any rescue bids would be much lower than Friday's closing price. Traders also heard rumours of more banks running into funding difficulties, something which gained more credence when the three-month Libor - the level at which banks lend to each other - rose from 6.39875% on Friday to 6.4475%, the highest level since September 19. Alliance &amp; Leicester, which has been hard hit in recent days despite repeated assurances from the bank that it had no worries over funding, fell another 25.5p to 581.5p. Shore Capital cut its rating on A&amp;L from buy to sell and said: \"Underlying fears over A&amp;L's funding position have surfaced in recent weeks following reports that the credit crunch has re-tightened. While the core investment case for A&amp;L is still valid, the re-tightening of conditions in the financial markets has cast renewed doubt over its ability to source adequate funding going forward.\" There were only three firms in the FTSE 100 in positive territory and, perhaps surprisingly given the financial turmoil, one of them was a bank. Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused business, climbed 15p to \u00a316.79 on reports that three Chinese banks had approached Standard's 17% shareholder, the Singapore investment agency Temasek, about buying its stake. Standard's shares came off their best levels as the market fell and Chinese news wires carried the banks' denials. The other two risers were the consumer goods group Unilever, up 13p to \u00a317.96 as it bought back shares and Investec issued a buy note, and the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew, 2.5p better at 575p in the wake of the \u00a3935m sale of its smaller rival Gyrus. The bid for Gyrus from Japan's Olympus Corporation was pitched at about 27 times forecast earnings for 2008, compared with the 20.5 times rating for Smith's shares. Gyrus itself jumped 207p to 607p on the news. Sebastien Jantet at Investec said a counter-bid was possible but not probable. \"There is always the scope for a counter-bid, possibly from Johnson &amp; Johnson or Stryker, both of whom we believe would be interested in Gyrus,\" he said. \"However, we do not think private equity would be interested.\" Among other major fallers were the property stocks. British Land lost 69p to 820.5p on talk that net asset values had dropped sharply since September, while the housebuilder Barratt Developments fell 24.5p to 480p after its trading statement reinforced concerns about the tough housing market. Its rival Persimmon was 39p lower at 789p. Miners were weaker as base metal prices fell, with copper at a near-eight month low. Antofagasta lost 54.5p to 657.5p, while Anglo American dropped 224p to \u00a328.62. The oil group Burren Energy slumped 173p to \u00a310.15 after Italy's Eni pulled out of a possible \u00a312-a-share bid for the firm. Burren said it had been willing to negotiate but Eni was not prepared to raise its offer. ABN Amro said: \"We believe Burren's response appears to be a clear sign that it would be willing to negotiate if a bid came in at around \u00a312.50 to \u00a313. We retain our hold recommendation, and while the share's initial reaction is understandable, we would be buyers on prolonged weakness (ie down to \u00a310).\" Elsewhere, ITV slipped 1.7p to 84.3p despite a relatively positive note on the broadcaster from UBS. It cut its price target from 100p to 90p, but raised its rating from sell to neutral. The DIY group Kingfisher fell 13.3p to 160.3p on continuing speculation it would cut its dividend. After UBS suggested this on Friday, JP Morgan joined in yesterday by forecasting a 40% drop in the payout and reducing its price target from 256p to 235p. Lower down the market, Marchpole, which designs and sells clothing and accessories for luxury brands, dropped 34.5p to 65p. Its half-year profits fell from \u00a34m to \u00a3500,000, partly through the termination of its licence for Yves Saint Laurent products late last year. But health and social care specialist Care UK added 20p to 365p after a 2% rise in full-year profits to \u00a314.5m and a confident outlook statement. Last week the shares were under pressure after it lost a diagnostics contract in the West Midlands. Investec said the results had come in ahead of its forecasts, and it believed the shares had been oversold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
