Officers investigating complaints that gnomes, plant pots and animal figures were disappearing from gardens across central Scotland raided the house in Clackmannanshire and found more than 40 ornaments, including rabbits, hedgehogs, birds, frogs and a terrier. A total of 62 plant pots and 25 solar lights were also recovered, together with a decorative wheelbarrow. Central Scotland police said there had been a spate of reported thefts in Stirling, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk. A spokeswoman for the force said the raid had been part of an 11-day anti-crime operation involving CID officers, the tactical crime and drugs unit and operational staff in Stirling area command. She added: \"We can confirm that two females have been charged in relation to the discovery and a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal.\" It is understood that police raided the house after a tip-off from a member of the public. Investigating officer Detective Constable Roy Lake said yesterday: \"This was a significant achievement by Central Scotland officers. \"We have been investigating a number of reported thefts of garden ornaments across the force area over the past few weeks. Our task now is to identify who the items belong to and ensure they are given back to their rightful owners.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
