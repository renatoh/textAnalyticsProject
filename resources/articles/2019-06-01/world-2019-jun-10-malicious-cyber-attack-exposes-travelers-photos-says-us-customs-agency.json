A \u201cmalicious cyber-attack\u201d hit a CBP \u201csubcontractor\u201d that had stored \u201ccopies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP\u201d, the agency said in a statement on Monday. CBP said \u201cnone of the image data has been identified on the dark web or internet\u201d, but declined to answer questions about the scope of the attack and stolen data, and refused to name the subcontractor. The US government maintains vast databases of travelers\u2019 personal information, including passport and visa photos, and airlines have also increasingly used facial recognition technology, sharing biometric data with federal agencies that store the sensitive information. CBP has been expanding its facial-scanning systems to international airports across the country since Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 executive order expediting the deployment of this surveillance. \u201cThis breach comes just as CBP seeks to expand its massive face recognition apparatus and collection of sensitive information from travelers, including license plate information and social media identifiers,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, American Civil Liberties Union senior legislative counsel, said in a statement. \u201cThis incident further underscores the need to put the brakes on these efforts and for Congress to investigate the agency\u2019s data practices.\u201d The best way to avoid these kinds of breaches, Guliani added, \u201cis not to collect and retain such data in the first place\u201d. A CBP spokesperson declined to comment on the number of people affected and the kind of information compromised, though a government official told the New York Times no more than 100,000 people had their data stolen. The agency sought to cast blame on the subcontractor, saying the unnamed firm violated CBP policies when it \u201ctransferred copies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP to the subcontractor\u2019s company network\u201d. CBP said it discovered the issue on 31 May, and that the subcontractor had transferred the data \u201cwithout CBP\u2019s authorization or knowledge\u201d in violation of \u201cmandatory security and privacy protocols outlined in their contract\u201d. The agency has since removed all equipment related to the breach and alerted Congress and other law enforcement agencies to the incident. \u201cCBP will unwaveringly work with all partners to determine the extent of the breach and the appropriate response,\u201d the statement said, adding that no CBP systems were compromised. Privacy activists have been sounding the alarm about the potential for data to be misused as law enforcement agencies, including US immigration authorities, have escalated surveillance of license plate data, travelers\u2019 social media accounts and other private information. Last week, a coalition of activist groups launched a new tool meant to help travelers avoid invasive facial recognition technologies at airports. \u201cEven if you trust the government with your biometric information, which you shouldn\u2019t, once our faces are scanned and stored in a database, they can be stolen and used for nefarious purposes,\u201d said Jelani Drew, a campaigner at Fight for the Future, one of the groups behind the new tool. \u201cThis technology is sold to companies under the lie that [it] makes us more safe, but in fact, it makes us less safe.\u201d In May, San Francisco lawmakers voted to make the city the first in the US to ban police and other government agencies from using facial recognition technology. The state of California and other municipalities across the country are now considering similar proposals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
