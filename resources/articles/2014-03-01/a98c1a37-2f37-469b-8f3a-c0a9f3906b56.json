The care bill has admirable intentions. Its very first clause promises, uncompromisingly, to enable wellbeing. It will set limits to what an individual has to spend themselves on their care, try to build a national framework of standards for degrees of need, and create an environment where local councils and GPs work together to provide the kind of package of support that will keep older people out of hospital and in the community. But for all its high ambition, there are serious doubts that it is up to the complex and costly task ahead. Age UK's latest research sets out the realities of meeting growing need with shrinking budgets, evidence borne out by analysis from the government's own Health and Social Care Information Centre. An ever-shrinking number of claimants is referred for further assessment, 9% down on 2007, and there's an even more dramatic fall in the total number receiving care, one in six fewer than in 2010. That's what happens when councils cut \u00a3770m out of spending on social care over three years. It means longer waits for care home places and home adaptations and less home care, too often of a poorer quality. It squeezes many out altogether: according to Age UK, the needs of nearly a million people are not being met. The coalition squeeze on council budgets is set to continue, and the money newly squeezed out of the NHS budget for social care is also meant to contribute to improved primary care. But councils have been strikingly innovative in finding ways of coping with the resources crisis. Early reports of the care and wellbeing boards that will manage the new local responsibility for public health suggest they are putting real energy into new ways of delivering care. But what is most needed is clarity. The care bill is supposed to make the future affordable. The state can't do it on its own. Private finance has to be part of the mix. But for that to happen, the limits of state support have to be clearly set out so that policies allowing the better off to insure against the future cost of care are developed. Instead there is a bewildering complexity, even around fundamental questions such as the way the new spending cap of \u00a372,000 will be measured and exactly who will be entitled to it, and when. For many people, it may still mean selling the family home. This is not the framework for a sustainable, affordable system that encourages planning and saving that was needed. As a result, councils and the NHS will have to go on delivering expensive crisis care that the state can no longer afford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
