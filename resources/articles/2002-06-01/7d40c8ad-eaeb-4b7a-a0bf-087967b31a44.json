Sorry Dominic, we're out of time. But I will make two keen observations. Greg dyes his hair and his Lucy is Kat Slater's doppelganger. That's the kind of analysis you don't get on the Beeb. Third set: Rusedski 5 - 2 Roddick* (Sets: 2 - 0) Another game, another breakpoint - which Rusedski takes to go within one game of the match. Incidentally, while the Brits are certainly loving him at Wimbledon, but not everyone is keen on Britain's Greg Rusedski. \"As we see it from this side of the pond, Rusedski is a weasle who sold his home country down the river, and now has a fake accent as he pretends to be a Brit,\" says Toronto's Tony Miller. \"That's right Greg. Train in Canada, grow up in Canada, develop your game in Canada, then bail for a bit of crumpet.\" How dare you talk about Lucy like that, Tony? \"I know I speak for many Canadians when I say that I hope he gets his backside kicked around the court,\" he adds. \"At least you guys have the common sense to recognize him for the insecure, immature poseur that he is.\" Third set: Rusedski* 4 - 2 Roddick* (Sets: 2 - 0) Just when you thought it was all over, Roddick gets a breakpoint - but two thunderous aces in a row put pay to his hopes. Dan's email is working again so he is fielding your messages while I concentrate on the tennis. \"'Soft hands at the net?' Sounds like something Jilly Cooper would come up with,\" says Jo Francis. \"We'll be hearing about his 'masculine insistence' next.\" I think you've just given yourself away, Jo. Third set: Rusedski 3 - 2 Roddick* (Sets: 2 - 0) General ineptitude from Roddick - a double fault, some poor volleying and playing a ball that's going long - gives Britain's Greg Rusedski a chance. And, hats off to him, he takes it with a forehand pass. There seems to be an inordinate amount of interest in Dan's dinner party last night. Michael Scheepers asks \"How was your dinner party last night? Don't ever leave Barry in charge of a tennis match ever again. But he is a good football commentator. Greetings from a nice and sunny Milan.\" And greetings from a sweaty office with barely any conditioning to you Michael. Third set: Rusedski* 2 - 2 Roddick (Sets: 2 - 0) Well, here's a surprise - a game with some rallies. Roddick's twirling top-spin lob brings it to deuce and then he hits a brilliant pass to get break-point. Barry Glendenning's interest picks up until Roddick, yet again, blasts yet another backhand pass into the net. Elizabeth Day (the Ribena drinker/ lunch skipper as I recall) writes: \"Is it just me Daniel, or does Greg Rusedski bear more than a passing resemblance to Will from Pop Idol? I'm guessing it's the chin.\" Good call, Elizabeth. Greg's just made it 2-2 incidentally... Third set: Rusedski* 1 - 2 Roddick (Sets: 2 - 0) No sooner have I typed in the bit in bold than both players have won a comfortable service game. No emails yet - sorry, my email is still down... Third set: Rusedski* 0 - 1 Roddick (Sets: 2 - 0) Roddick wins his service game fairly comfortably, but his real problem is the Rusedski serve - he hasn't come close to breaking it. In fact, he's yet to hit one backhand winner. Second set: Rusedski* 6 - 4 Roddick (Sets: 2 - 0) Sean Ingle here. We've had severe technical difficulties, but don't worry - you haven't missed much. Just lots of wham, bam and - in Greg's case at least - thank-you maam. He's now two sets up. Second set: Rusedski* 3 - 1 Roddick (Sets: 1 - 0) There is more to Greg's game than just his serve. He has lovely soft hands at the net too. No bad gags about moisturiser please. Larry Boothe has sorted himself with a date. He wanted me to let you know. This is starting to degenerate into some kind of geeks' chat room. Stop it now. Second set: Rusedski 2 - 1 Roddick* (Sets: 1 - 0) Dum-dee-dum. Roddick wins his service game. I missed the whole thing. They are not helping me here. Second set: Rusedski* 2 - 0 Roddick (Sets: 1 - 0) Easy peasy for Britain's Greg Rusedski. Vesna and Natalie are writing in all sorts messages which I can't possibly repeat. Most of them seem to concern Barry on my left. I have just got a text from four days ago now? And there was I thinking people were just ignoring me. Maybe it has cuaght something off my Mac. Roddick is talking to himself and twitching. It is not looking good for the American. Second set: Rusedski 1 - 0 Roddick* (Sets: 1 - 0) Roddick's first serve has gone to pot. He's only getting a third of them in, which when it's your not-so-secret weapon is a bit pap. Rusedski takes him to breaking point. The American re-adjusts his reverse cap and blazes a forehand carelessly well wide of the mark. Greg has the early break. And deservedly so. Hayley writes in: \"Aren't you supposed to be at a posh Cambridge dinner? How are you going to make it? Have they chartered you a copter? Do you have a date cos I've just been stood up?\" Can anyone help Hayley out here? I'm a taken man. First set: Rusedski wins 6 - 3 Awesome play from Rusedki and, suitably enough, he wins the set with an ace. \"I think Greg's wife Lucy (are they all called Lucy? - ed) has a little too much rouge on today,\" says Andy Farrell. I'll be sure to pass on your make-up tips, Andy. First set: Rusedski 5 - 3* Roddick Shock and absolute horror. Greg breaks serve. No really. \"Gosh, just realised it's started. Is there much grunting?\" asks Jo Francis. Now that Rusedki has got the break, it has started. No grunting yet though. At least not from the players. But I wouldn't put anything past Barry who is sitting to my left. Can Roddick break back? First set: Rusedski* 4 - 3 Roddick Oh. Oh, stop it now. Too quick. I can't keep up. Guess what: more big serves which the other chap doesn't bother to return, principally because he can't see them, but also because he wants to get the game over so that he he can have a go. And why is my mobile suddenly giving me text message from three days ago? First set: Rusedski 3 - 3 Roddick* It's all going with serve thus far. And, sorry to say it, but it's all rather tedious. It's like they're just trying to outserve each other. Sean Ingle wishes it to be known that Barry is a bad man. First set: Rusedski* 3 - 2 Roddick Slow it down, fellas. If you keep serving through your games this quickly I won't be able to avail the users of such informative anecdotes as that provided by Richard Marsden who writes: \"You may be interested to know that Greg Rusedski is an anagram of 'rugged kisser'. If you're into that kind of thing.\" John McEnroe might be, by the sounds of it. What is a man of his age doing still wearing an earring anyway. Roddick hits the ball very, very hard indeed. First set: Rusedski 2 - 2 Roddick* This Roddick is a bit of a feisty one. We had a bit of afters with the eyes during this game. I've got the John McEnroe commentary in my ear. \"This is two big guys feeling each other out,\" he said. That's not very BBC is it? First set: Rusedski* 2 - 1 Roddick \"Dan, I was in the same high school and class as Greg for 7 years in Montreal,\" writes someone called Crobar from, erm, Montreal. \"Greg has worked very hard and had a great career, but a Wimbledon title would certainly ice the cake.\" Then Crobar goes off on one. \"Robert G. Miller provided some much needed funds early on from his electronics empire and provided a job for Helen thereafter. Mr. Hallowell engineered Greg's mind. Tony Wind worked his body into shape in the McGill Fieldhouse. Tom remortgaged the house and I provided the odd homework assignment. Greg has certainly paid everyone back in full, but the Brits deserve a British champ (Greg has worked hard on his accent too!). May all those early mornings and three hour practices after classes come to fruition in the form of a Wimbledon breakfast with Sir Timmy Henman 10 days from now. Greg, turn on the fire hydrant and extinguish the Roddick flames!\" I was trying to work out what the Dickens Crobar was on about while Greg was winning his second game. He made heavy weather of it though. First set: Rusedski 1 - 1 Roddick* Oh we're having laugh here alright. One of the line judges just said out in a very loud voice and everybody giggled uproariously. Meanwhile Roddick holds on to his serve. They're not wasting much time. First set: Rusedski* 1 - 0 Roddick Afternoon all, it's Dan in the commentary box first. As predicted, Greg comes up with a few unreturnable serves which Roddick, surprise surprise, cannot return. Greg wins the game. Scintillating preamble: Both these boys have big serves. Massive. Huge. You should see them going at it in the warm-up. Don't expect many rallies. The player who can return best should win out. They have renamed Henman Hill for the afternoon. It's called Rusedski Ridge. Ye gads.
