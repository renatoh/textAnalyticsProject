All year, in Wolverhampton, these words have been in italics. And the masochists at Molineux have endless theories with which to torture themselves about where, precisely, the wheels came off a campaign featuring the loss of an 11-point lead, and promotion, to local rivals West Bromwich . Of all people. Was it the home defeat to Grimsby in mid-March that started the wobble? What about Birmingham away the previous week, 2-0 up at half-time before the ceiling, literally, fell in? As the wind lifted a piece of corrugated iron off the main-stand roof at St Andrew's, down below Wolves were conceding two goals. And as it crashed to the ground, there was a temptation even then to see it as a metaphor for an inevitable fall from the summit of Division One. For Wolves fans expect to fail. The pessimism, the doom and gloom that routinely clouds Wolves' 'long-suffering' supporters might seem woven into the fabric of the club. The city's motto, represented in its team's gold-and-black colours, promises that 'Out of Darkness Cometh Light'. But while Wolves have surely done enough fumbling around in the darkness, the sunshine has just never quite arrived. The Molineux neurosis might be a kind of Seasonal Affective Disorder. And it has lasted 19 years. Of course, last season wasn't the first time Wolves have slipped, spectacularly, down the league. In 1980, Wolves finished sixth in the (old) First Division, Andy Gray burst the net at Wembley to win the League Cup and there was a (brief) run in the Uefa Cup. But of course, it was a false dawn. Instead, the club's infamous new owners, the Bhatti brothers, sucked Wolves dry. On 12 May 1984, their last game in Division One produced a 4-0 thumping by Stoke. This was just the beginning. Three consecutive relegations dumped them, bankrupt, in Division Four. The Bhattis disappeared back to Saudi Arabia, leaving the club hanging by a thread and three sides of the decaying stadium condemned. This is 1986. Offstage, Margaret Thatcher's closure of the country's industrial heartlands left widespread depressions. But whereas Liverpool and Everton offered Scousers some local pride in hard times, Wolverhampton merely compounded the anger and humiliation. Wolves' 'glorious past' of the 1950s and 1960s has offered a comfortable refuge over the past 20 years. Where West Ham are forever blowing bubbles, Wolves' song is Those Were the Days . Nostalgia is a longing for home, and Wolves fans see that place as the top division. Perhaps memories of past glories have been embroidered over time; they may even, as some say, have produced delu sions of grandeur at Molineux. None the less, aside from the trophies, until the disastrous mid-1980s, Wolves had spent only two post-war seasons outside that top flight, and aggregate league positions even up to 1997 place them in England's top 10. By 1987, having been saved by the local council, Wolves began the climb away from rock bottom. They made the play-offs that first season in the league's basement, losing to Aldershot ( Aldershot! ). A year later, Graham Turner's team had regrouped to win Division Four and the Sherpa Van Trophy. Wolves took 50,000 to Wembley. The next season, powered by the edginess and potency of Steve Bull, the Division Three championship followed. There was an inexorable symmetry, it seemed, in which the consecutive relegations of the 1980s were matched by consecutive promotions in the 1990s. So much for seeming. Wolves did make it back to Division One. But only because they renamed Division Two. The bandwagon has been stalled on that second tier for a decade. At kick-off time in Cardiff tomorrow, the ticking clock on a Wolves website will show 'Time Spent in the Wrong Divisions' to be 6,952 days, 22 hours, 16 minutes and 33 seconds (approximately). In the meantime, Sir Jack Hayward's backing has brought to completion a redevelopment of the stadium that started in 1979 and turned Molineux into a golden palace fit for glory. The capacity of 28,500 can't always cope with demand, though, and the supporters are certainly demanding. The tradition and the wealth have raised expectation, and disillusionment, to hysterical levels. The frustrated fans have created an intense, manic depressive arena at Molineux: a passionate, partisan goal-start one moment, the next a burden, bickering and sniping. It's not the despair that gets you, they say, but the hope. Many different approaches have been taken. The ex-England manager's experience, for example. The world-weary Graham Taylor (1994-95) tried hard to convince himself and everyone else that he'd conquered his England demons. He hadn't. Failure in the play-offs was followed by the sack. Wolves then tried a highly rated up-and-coming manager. Having walked out on Leicester for the 'bigger club' he saw at Molineux, Mark McGhee (1995-98) bought all their best players. Martin O'Neill rebuilt stronger on the proceeds and soon McGhee's postbag was full of smug postcards from Madrid, where the Uefa Cup had taken Leicester to Atl\u00e9tico. McGhee, meanwhile, was failing in the play-offs. Sacked. The club even tried not investing in the team, on the basis that it had worked for Derby County. New manager Colin Lee (1998-2000) cut his cloth accordingly but it came to nothing. And now Dave Jones (appointed in 2001), dour but constant, is the latest incumbent. He's already failed in the play-offs but, unusually, has avoided the sack. Jones has this season concentrated on building the team's mental strength, so lacking last year. Enter Paul Ince and Denis Irwin and an unfamiliar consistency. To attack effectively, Wolves need Colin Cameron to dart from midfield and Mark Kennedy to deliver from the left. Kenny Miller might then drop deep, spin and strike. Defensively, the club's youth scheme holds sway. Joleon Lescott, Molineux player of the season twice running, has many admirers, and those of goalkeeper Matt Murray are growing in number. On their day, as against Newcastle in the FA Cup this season, Wolves are a strong, well balanced team. Samuel Beckett's advice to failures was to 'try again: fail better'. But what else is there left to try? The play-off final is a start. In four previous attempts in the First Division, the club have never got past the semis. After 19 years, culminating in last season , nobody dares tempt fate by mentioning the 'P' word; the fans are all defiantly pessimistic. Sheffield United have scored six goals against Wolves already this season and must be favourites. But when the teams walk out at Cardiff, take a look at those 'long-suffering' fans. Shadows of doubt will lurk within. Yet, dressed in gold, they'll appear to be bathing in sunshine. And if.... just if.... everything will be illuminated. Could that be light at the end of this long, long tunnel? With United also already in a playoff position, both Dave Jones and Neil Warnock left key players out for the bigger test ahead, leaving few clues for tomorrow's final.
