Seven of those held, including the woman, were arrested in Greater Manchester while the other three men were held in Staffordshire, South Yorkshire and the West Midlands. All 10 were detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Police described the terror suspects as of north African and Iraqi Kurdish in origin. One of the raids took place in flats above a kebab shop in a university district of central Manchester. Residents reported hearing noise at around 3.30am and seeing police officers. The operation was co-ordinated by Greater Manchester police and involved the security services and the Metropolitan police's anti-terrorist branch. Assistant chief constable Dave Whatton, of Greater Manchester police, said the raids were part of an \"ongoing operation related to the threat of terrorism\". He said: \"[The operation] has been under way for some time and will continue. Police refused to comment on suggestions that the Trafford Centre in Manchester's city centre was a specific terrorist target. Part of Upper Brook Street, an area of central Manchester popular with students, was cordoned off by police. The area cordoned off affected three businesses - AK Computers, Dolphins takeaway and Funky Fones - and the flats above them. The properties are three storeys high, with the top two storeys of each converted into flats. A Manchester University spokeswoman said it was not aware that any students had been arrested. Sheikh Mohammed bal Qadri, deputy director of the Islamic Academy on Upper Brook Street, said there was no indication that any of its members were involved. He said the majority of worshippers at his mosque were Libyans and Omanis. He said: \"There is no suspicious activities at this mosque. There's full control here. Since September 11 we have been very vigilant, as mosques should be. \"If I see a person who is new, I ask him why he is here and what he is doing and ask these kind of questions. We have been established since 1974 and we have had no problems at all, nothing to do with terrorism. We are against all these evil acts. Irfaan Arif, 24, and his cousin Muhammad Tahir, 24, who run AK Computers, were woken in their flat at about 3.30am. Mr Arif said: \"We heard lots of banging and shouting and general noise. We went to the window and looked outside and there were loads of police there. There were about 10 police officers outside and some inside. \"I went downstairs and opened up the shutter of the shop but was told by an officer to go back inside.\" Today's raids were the latest in a series made as UK security agencies attempt to prevent an attack on the UK following threats from al-Qaida. Last month, raids across south-east England resulted in a number of arrests and the discovery of 600kg of ammonium nitrate fertiliser. Fertiliser has been used in bombings linked to al-Qaida, including the Bali attacks of 2002. Six British Muslims face terrorism charges following the raids, and appeared at the Old Bailey last Friday. The six, who are yet to deliver pleas, are being held in custody until July 16, when they will reappear in court. Despite numerous al-Qaida threats, and warnings by politicians and senior police that a major attack on the UK is \"inevitable\", it has not so far been targeted. A Manchester policeman, Stephen Oake, was stabbed to death last year when arresting terror suspects alleged to have possession of small amounts of the poison ricin. Tensions surrounding the possibility of an attack in Britain have increased since the March 11 Madrid train bombings, in which 191 people were killed. The Spanish attacks were blamed on a north African al-Qaida linked group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
