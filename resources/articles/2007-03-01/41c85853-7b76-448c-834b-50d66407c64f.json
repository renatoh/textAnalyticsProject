Her last 'treat' was a night in a so-so country house hotel on the outskirts of the M25 where the mock-Tudor rooms smelt of stale cigarette smoke and the restaurant had all the ambience of a motorway service station cafeteria. With Mother's Day fast approaching, I need to make amends so I opt for Chewton Glen, a hotel which is regularly voted one of the best in Britain. First impressions are good: a welcoming log fire in the entrance hall and the offer to send up tea and biscuits to the room. Our suite, the Masterman Ready (named after an 1841 seafaring novel) is gorgeous. Recently refurbished in the kind of expensive, muted shades which come with names like 'oyster 'and 'mink', it's feminine but not fussy. The bathroom is huge and there's a flat-screen TV on the wall at the end of the stand-alone bathtub, complete with waterproof remote control. Mum wastes no time in opening up a bottle of champagne and opening the doors on to the private terrace where she surveys the gardens with a look on her face that says 'I think I'm going to be very happy here'. We had imagined ourselves going for bracing walks in the New Forest, but the rain is relentless which is actually a blessing, because it means we don't have to feel guilty about spending the next two days ricocheting between the spa, the swimming pool, the sauna and Jacuzzi, in our towelling robes. The only time we get properly dressed is to go down to dinner. The menu is well thought out, with a mix of classics like grilled Dover sole and more adventurous dishes such as sea bass with pea risotto and lobster foam. My main course of roast chicken is perfectly executed and entirely without pretension while mum's dessert of poached Victoria plums renders her speechless for a whole 15 minutes. Perhaps the most surprising thing about Chewton Glen is that despite its luxury pedigree, it's not remotely stuffy. The young staff are attentive and friendly, and the public areas comfortable rather than grand. We were there during half-term holidays and the presence of several (admittedly very well-behaved) children in the swimming pool and in the restaurant in the evening added to the relaxed atmosphere. (I can't help thinking that if you are taking your kids on mini-breaks to Chewton Glen at the age of eight you are setting them up for a lifetime of disappointment.) Best of all, my mum loves it. As we drive home through the New Forest, the not entirely pleasing thought occurs to me that a line has been crossed, the bar raised, a new standard set for future weekend jaunts. I can already hear the refrain: 'It's nice but it's not Chewton Glen, is it?' We liked: everything, but the heated poolside loungers deserve special mention. We didn't like: going home The verdict: expensive but if you are looking for the classic country house hotel experience, look no further. The price: doubles start from \u00a3295 a night and suites from \u00a3572. Dinner costs \u00a362.50 for three courses including service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
