Many will have been here before. The government, clearly, hasn't. An email went out on Friday asking for volunteers to help man the borders on Wednesday. They asked for people to volunteer by 5pm. Only trouble was the email was sent out at 7.30pm. And 7.30pm on a Friday is not exactly a time when government departments are buzzing. And for those who were indeed touched by the Dunkirk spirit, another downer. The email said they'd have to train on Sunday. Few takers. Isn't this just the tightest ship? \u2022 More soul-searching at the Leveson inquiry, where there are daily revelations and not much to lift the spirits. But we have a tale arising from the hacking affair. One might view it as heartwarming. It involves Derek Webb, the former policeman who was paid by the News of the World to follow persons of interest, including lawyers representing hacking victims. He was also sent to snoop on the Labour MP and Murdochian bete noir Tom Watson. But after the NoW bit the dust the two had occasion to speak. At which point Watson pointed out that Webb, as a sole trader working exclusively for the NoW, probably enjoyed employment rights and might consider asserting them. Webb set off in search of a good lawyer. Thus can enemies become friends. \u2022 Accusations of greenwash appear to be swirling around the Green party, with a particular focus on the party's management co-ordinator and executive member, Mark Cridge. For as the party's leader, Caroline Lucas, joined the Occupy London protesters on the steps of St Paul's denouncing corporates and all things capitalist, Cridge continues to do very nicely thank you out of his day job as global managing director of communications agency Isobar, which makes a handy living out of running advertising campaigns. Among Isobar's clients are some of the world's biggest corporates, including notably News International and Coca-Cola. All firm favourites with grassroots Greens. \u2022 And just when you thought the reputation of England's rugby performance in New Zealand could sink no lower, it has. Coventry University students heard on Friday from a well-placed observer who was there in the Altitude bar in Queenstown that fateful September night with Mike Tindall, dwarves, blondes and much alcohol; and also with the \"team\" in other hostelries on other nights. Much the favourite story of the tour de farce concerned an England young buck who took a conquest back to her hostel to discuss tactics etc. Once there, he announced he had no money to pay the nightly tariff of $30 that would allow him to enter the establishment. So she paid. They discussed the finer points. Yes, they did us proud in so many respects. \u2022 Hard to express the sadness occasioned by the Sunday Times front page allegations about donations of \u00a3100,000 to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's foundation by the firm Argus Scotland. Adam Ingram, the former Labour MP and former defence minister, is a non-executive director of Argus Scotland. And brutes that they are, the Sunday Times went out of its way to point this out. We hope it all turns out for the best, for we have long since forgotten how once the bruiser Ingram sought to deflect some reasonable questions we put to him by condemning us as \"bottom feeders\". Soured relations at the time, but life's too short. If he ever needs a reference we'll vouch for him. \u2022 Finally, as a position it seemed clear enough. Officials of the Young Britons' Foundation, the self-described madrasa for young, excitable rightwing Tories, called the NHS \"the biggest waste of money in the UK\", and suggested the waterboarding of prisoners can be justified. Thus Eric Pickles sought clear blue water. \"We don't agree with these views,\" a spokesman for Pickles told us. \"The YBF organisation is independent of the Conservative party.\" But that was then. Now the YBF has its activist training conference, on 9 December. And proudly they unveil their star speaker. Will Eric turn up? Will he be able to stay away? diary@theguardian.com twitter.com/hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
