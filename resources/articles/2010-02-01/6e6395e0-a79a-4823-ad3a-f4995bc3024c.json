They are kicking off a Six Nations campaign at home for a fifth straight season \u2013 France, strangely, are preparing for their fifth consecutive opening away trip \u2013 and last week's warm-weather training camp in Portugal was a success. Their autumn injury list has also eased appreciably ahead of Saturday's Centenary Test at Twickenham when Wales will be invited to celebrate 100 years of Anglo-Saxon humility and grace. What could possibly go wrong? The answer, of course, is everything should Warren Gatland's Wales succeed in pooping the party and if Martin Johnson's team selection returns to haunt him. Few English supporters will be singing Jerusalem with any relish if their retro-shirted XV stutter to a listless defeat and the onus is on the management to pick a team prepared to take the game to the opposition. Simply waiting patiently for the Welsh to implode may not be good enough. Brian Ashton's England had the right initial idea in this fixture two years ago, only for injuries and ill-fated decision-making to allow Wales to recover from 16-6 down at half-time with the help of 20 second-half points. Had it not been for that turnaround and a subsequent grim defeat in Scotland prefaced by midweek photographs of Danny Cipriani emerging from a nightclub in the early hours, Ashton might still be England's head coach. While Johnson's immediate future, for a number of political reasons, is not quite on such a knife edge, this is a signature selection in terms of how he wants England to play in this championship and beyond. His choices, in particular, in the midfield and the front row will reveal much. There seems little point bringing in Shontayne Hape, who turned 29 over the weekend, simply to sniff the Bagshot air which suggests the ex-New Zealand rugby league international will feature in the not-too-distant future, either this week or in Rome. England need someone to neutralise Jamie Roberts, as Joe Worsley did last year, and offer a little midfield dexterity and Hape, while not the paciest in the world, might just fit that specific bill if Mathew Tait, a man with a little bit of history against Wales, is still not deemed the ideal solution. The alternative is a combination of Wilkinson, Flutey and either Tait or Dan Hipkiss. Wilkinson, interestingly, has never played alongside Flutey before; given both men will be 30 by next weekend, it underlines the whirling fates of international rugby. Neither has Flutey started a Test with Tait or Hipkiss as his centre partner, which makes pairing two Kiwis together for England seem almost rational. Flutey seems happy with his form and fitness for Brive since returning from injury and, on paper at least, should be able to help Toulon's Wilkinson steer England around the old cabbage patch. If Johnson were blithely unconcerned about the potential consequences of defeat, he would probably start with Tait at No13 and elevate Matt Mullan, Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes to the starting line-up. As it is, nagging away in the back of everyone's mind will be the desire for a win by whatever means. This may yet mean that the long-suffering Tim Payne, under the cosh for Wasps lately, is invited to take the strain against what the injured Phil Vickery described yesterday as \"the best front row in the competition\". Dan Cole is mounting a strong case in every sense for the role of tight-head but, fitness issues permitting, the Leicester man may have to settle for a place on the bench behind another Six Nations rookie, David Wilson. Both Cole and Lawes would also add value as impact replacements, a role which might also suit Steffon Armitage. England cannot rely on Lewis Moody remaining undamaged for the entire championship and Lawes could cover both the lock and blindside positions if necessary. It would be nice to see Ben Foden involved but Johnson may also have him in mind for the Italy game in Rome. The case for a spot of judicious rotation has rarely been stronger. Johnson is more likely to use the term horses for courses as he attempts to manoeuvre England past the first big obstacle of the year. If he requires further inspiration this week, ESPN Classic are showing the games from England's 1991 grand slam-winning campaign under Will Carling, an era so distant that Brian Smith was playing at fly-half for Ireland. It was also the year that England beat Wales comfortably and chose the same 15 starting players for every game. The trick, then and now, is to identify the right XV from the outset."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
