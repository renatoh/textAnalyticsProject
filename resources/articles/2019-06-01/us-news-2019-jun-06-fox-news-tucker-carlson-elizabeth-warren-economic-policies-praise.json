Carlson, a provocative presenter on Fox News and a strong supporter of Donald Trump, quoted extensively on Wednesday from Warren\u2019s economic plan, and said: \u201cShe sounds like Donald Trump at his best.\u201d Warren\u2019s progressive, interventionist plan calls for \u201caggressive new government policies to support American workers\u201d. The details were released ahead of her visit this week to America\u2019s manufacturing-centric midwestern rust belt. \u201cAmazingly that\u2019s pretty much what it is \u2013 economic patriotism,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cPure, old-fashioned economics, how to preserve good-paying American jobs.\u201d \u201cEven more remarkable, many of Warren\u2019s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,\u201d he said. \u201cShe says the US government should buy American products when it can \u2013 and of course it should. She says we need more workplace apprenticeship programs because four-year college degrees are not right for everyone. Well, that\u2019s true. She says that taxpayers ought to benefit from the research and development they pay for.\u201d \u201cSo who is this Elizabeth Warren, you ask?\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWell, not the race-hustling, gun-grabbing, abortion extremist you thought you knew.\u201d While Carlson criticized Warren\u2019s stance on social issues, he said any candidate who promoted \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d with social conservatism, such as opposition to gay marriage and abortion, would be \u201celected in a landslide\u201d. He went on to praise Trump\u2019s call for tariffs, which will be imposed on Mexico from next week in an attempt to force the nation to stem unlawful immigration over the US-Mexico border."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
