In the space of just two years she has evolved from singing flamenco standards on her death-obsessed debut album Los \u00c1ngeles, to controversially modernising that genre\u2019s folkloric traditions via the high-gloss sheen of R&amp;B on her breakthrough collection El Mal Querer, swiftly becoming pop\u2019s most exciting new superstar in the process. Last year, in a New York Times profile, the 25-year-old was hailed as \u201cthe Rihanna of flamenco\u201d. Along the way, she has picked up fans ranging from James Blake to Alicia Keys (to whom she\u2019s been giving Spanish lessons) and director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast her in his latest film Pain and Glory. That\u2019s thanks in part to the album\u2019s crossover hit Malamente, full of complex handclap rhythms and sleek electronic pulses, which landed her five Latin Grammy nominations and a performance at the MTV Europe music awards. Its head-spinning, Hype-Williams-does-Top-Gear video, featuring Rosal\u00eda executing flawless choreography in the back of a lorry, and later being lifted skywards on the prongs of a forklift, currently stands at 85m YouTube views. Its mix of industrial, modern and traditional (matadors lure motorbikes rather than bulls; cape-wearing penitents glide around on skateboards) is a perfect encapsulation of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s merging of Spain\u2019s past and present. It\u2019s been a busy 12 months, capped this weekend with a performance at Glastonbury that will see her reach a whole new audience, a la Christine and the Queens in 2016, and tighten her grip as global pop\u2019s latest innovator. If this newfound fame has unsettled her, she is not showing it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been preparing all my life for this moment,\u201d she says on the phone from a Barcelona studio. Her grasp of English is much better than she gives herself credit for \u2013 \u201cOh my God, my English is the worst!\u201d she screams in frustration at one point \u2013 considering all her songs are performed in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m working harder now than at any other point in my life because I have a fear of losing what I have,\u201d she adds. \u201cBefore, I had nothing; I didn\u2019t have any contacts in the industry, nobody around me was a musician, so it was really hard. But I also had nothing to lose so I\u2019ve always been fearless.\u201d That determination has been put to the test recently with accusations from certain sections of the Spanish media that Rosal\u00eda\u2019s use of flamenco iconography \u2013 traditions fostered by the art form\u2019s historical ties to Spain\u2019s marginalised Gypsy (or Gitanos) community in Andalusia \u2013 amounts to cultural appropriation. Rosal\u00eda was born in the more affluent region of Catalonia and critics have cited her use of Gitano vocabulary and phrasing as problematic. \u201cFlamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,\u201d Gitana activist Noelia Cort\u00e9s told Public Radio International in 2018. While Rosal\u00eda\u2019s initial position was defensive, citing in interviews the fact that she studied flamenco from a young age as proof of her passion (she has a bachelor\u2019s degree in flamenco vocal performance), she offers a slightly more balanced take today. \u201cIt is very important that people understand how important flamenco is to the Gypsy community,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cThere have been some amazing Gypsy artists. It\u2019s important that we give visibility to that, but at the same time people have to be fair and recognise that Paco de Luc\u00eda was the biggest guitar player in this style of music in the world and he wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Lola Flores was the biggest Spanish female flamenco icon and she wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Music is beyond races, beyond territories.\u201d She says she is aware, too, of her privileged position and keen to create a platform \u201cthat\u2019s helpful for all the people who don\u2019t have the opportunities\u201d. She grows angry, however, when reflecting on the implication that she is nothing more than a capitalist construct and that flamenco is merely an adornment to a campaign with a huge marketing budget; the Association of Feminist Gitanas for Diversity (AFGD) last year dismissed her as a \u201cposeur\u201d. \u201cWhen an artist becomes pop, it\u2019s because the people choose it,\u201d she says, now speaking at a canter. \u201cYes, you can have that dream to be a big pop star, but it\u2019s the audience that puts you in that position. I never had a paid marketing campaign, it was never like that. Never. The content was, and is, radical and it worked. When Malamente was released I had no label [she is now signed to Columbia]. I made El Mal Querer with my friend; we produced it together, and worked on it for more than a year and a half. If you\u2019re a creative person and use creativity a lot in the way you treat your craft then you are probably going to succeed. When people say marketing and shit like that, they don\u2019t understand; you can\u2019t force people!\u201d She lets out a half-laugh, half-gasp, suddenly aware of how frustrated she\u2019s become. Rosal\u00eda relaxes when explaining why she was drawn to flamenco in the first place. At the age of 13, she and sister Pili (now her stylist) would hang out near parks with older friends who\u2019d blare its tales of emotional blood-letting from their car stereos. She was captivated instantly. When I ask why, she hesitates, adding a \u201cthis is my personal opinion\u201d caveat, so as not to ruffle any feathers. \u201cI would say, for me, flamenco is so pure, so raw,\u201d she says. \u201cI love pop culture but sometimes I miss the root, the rawness. With flamenco, I felt like I always needed it, I just didn\u2019t know it. It\u2019s purer than anything else for me. If you don\u2019t put the truth into it, it won\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know what it will be but it won\u2019t be flamenco.\u201d If flamenco is the music of passion, of experience, of a life well lived, where does the wise-beyond-her-years sadness that permeates her songs emanate from? The answer, it turns out, is Carl Jung. \u201cHe talks about a collective unconsciousness, and I love this concept. I\u2019m a spiritual person, and I really think that we don\u2019t just die.\u201d Despite being inspired by Flamenca, an obscure 13th-century novel about a jealous husband who locks his wife in a tower, El Mal Querer (it roughly translates as \u201ctoxic love\u201d) has tracks that reference both Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me a River and Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Say My Name. \u201cJustin Timberlake was everywhere [growing up],\u201d she says. \u201cDestiny\u2019s Child was something I\u2019d hear all the time in Spain, too; same with the Spice Girls and Britney Spears. These were icons. They influenced me and I have no problem giving them credit [for that]. I love it the same way I love Mozart or Bach.\u201d Who was her favourite Spice Girl? \u201cI just loved the bus!\u201d she says. \u201cThey used to have a Spice Girls bus and I dreamed of having a bus like that.\u201d In fact, growing up in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, a small town on the outskirts of Barcelona, surrounded by factories, Rosal\u00eda would obsess over any large vehicle. \u201cI used to constantly see trucks and study the drivers\u2019 lifestyle,\u201d she says. Years later, she would subvert this \u201cvery masculine space\u201d in her videos for Malamente and the lilting Pienso En Tu Mir\u00e1, in which truck drivers bleed out through their hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting for me to explore visually; to put women in places that usually have a male energy.\u201d One of El Mar Querer\u2019s more aggressive songs, De Aqui No Sales, samples a revving motorbike to create its off beat. Growing up, her musical icons were all female: besides Britney, Bey and the Spice Girls, she loved Janis Joplin, Lola Flores and Lil Kim. The team she surrounds herself with now is mainly women, too. \u201cMy single Aute Cuture was mastered by a woman, and that was important for me. It\u2019s important we give visibility to women in an industry that\u2019s still very masculine.\u201d Obsessing over Lil Kim inspired another of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s recent visual statements: her mythical beauty gang in the Aute Cuture video are bedecked with the kind of intricate nail embellishments that turn talons into weapons. \u201cI think [having] long nails is a radical feminist symbol,\u201d she says. \u201cVery extreme. It\u2019s more than just being pretty, it\u2019s about power.\u201d Talk turns to Madonna, a similarly power-obsessed artist. In a recent interview with Spanish radio station Los 40 Principales, the star claimed she had invited Rosal\u00eda to perform at her 60th birthday party in Morocco. Things got complicated, according to Madonna, when \u201ca manager stepped in and then an agent stepped in and then five people were involved and then they wanted to charge an extraordinary amount of money and then it was 36 people [wanting to attend], and I was like: \u2018Wait, what?\u2019 so it never happened.\u201d Rosal\u00eda is keen to clear up any misunderstanding. \u201cI was very excited because I am a big Madonna fan,\u201d she starts carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this too much, but I can tell you that it was no more than eight people around me, not 36, which is crazy. I was happy to go there and sing for her, but it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d Has she listened to Madame X yet? \u201cNo because I haven\u2019t had the time. I can\u2019t wait to listen to it. I\u2019m a huge fan of Madonna and she knows it. I admire her a lot.\u201d For now, there are more pressing matters at hand. Earlier I had asked what her friends would say about her. \u201cThey\u2019d say I\u2019m a perfectionist, that I\u2019m a workaholic and that they don\u2019t see me as much as they\u2019d like to,\u201d she said. And they\u2019re right. She currently has collaborations with the likes of Pharrell, Arca, Oneohtrix Point Never, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa to get finished and the recording studio is calling. \u201cWe\u2019re hopefully going to finish all these songs soon and I can\u2019t wait to share them,\u201d she says, near breathless. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d We all should be.
