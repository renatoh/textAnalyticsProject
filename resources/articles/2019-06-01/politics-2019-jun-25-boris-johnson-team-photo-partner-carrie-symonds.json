Speaking to LBC, Johnson refused at least half a dozen times to comment on the photo of himself and Carrie Symonds seemingly sitting in the garden of a pub. He would not answer when the host, Nick Ferrari, pressed: \u201cThis is quite an old picture isn\u2019t it?\u201d Johnson also argued that the country should be \u201cmore positive\u201d on the prospects of a good Brexit outcome, and seemingly roll back on his plan to focus tax cuts on high earners. The pictures appeared in selected newspapers on Monday, and were reprinted on several front pages on Tuesday, without any details of where and when they were taken, or by whom. The presumption was they were put out by Johnson\u2019s team as a PR move in the wake of a damaging weekend of headlines. Police were called to the London home he shares with Symonds in the early hours of Friday after neighbours heard a furious row \u2013 an event Johnson has repeatedly refused to comment on. Quizzed by Ferrari, Johnson said he understood why the event had prompted media interest. \u201cYes, of course, and I readily accept that and understand that. Newspapers and other media outlets, of course, are going to want to print and to speculate what they choose,\u201d he said. Insisting again he would not disclose details about those close to him, Johnson refused repeatedly to say how or why the photos of him and Symonds had reached the press, trying numerous times to change the subject. \u201cNewspapers will print whatever they are going to print,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we spend on things extraneous to what I want to do, the bigger the waste of time.\u201d Pressed by Ferrari, he said: \u201cThere are all sorts of pictures of me on the internet, which pop up from time to time.\u201d Asked if he knew the picture was coming out, he said: \u201cI am aware of all sorts of pictures of me out on the internet, and it is entirely up to newspapers to decide what they want to print.\u201d Johnson also declined to say where and when the photo was taken, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not a state secret; it just happens to be something that I don\u2019t want to give to you.\u201d Asked why his hair seemed longer in the photo than it is currently, he said: \u201cThis is beyond satire.\u201d On the substance of his Brexit plans, Johnson dismissed the idea he could be hampered by Tory rebels, saying the party was \u201cstaring down the barrel of defeat\u201d if it did not deliver a departure plan, which would focus minds. Johnson said he would \u201cdisaggregate the elements of the current withdrawal agreement \u2013 you need to take the serviceable bits\u201d to seek a new arrangement with the EU, and prepare for possible no deal as \u201cthe other leg of the proposal\u201d. He insisted no deal would not cause a hard border in Northern Ireland, but gave no details on how this would be avoided beyond the general idea of so-called maximum facilitation checks using technology, which would not be ready for several years. Johnson also argued against the view of the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that the UK would be hit automatically by tariffs on exports to the EU in a no-deal Brexit, arguing the country could rely on article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt). \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking that it\u2019s not an option. It\u2019s certainly an option,\u201d Johnson said, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s be more positive about this. It\u2019s time this country stopped being so down about it\u2019s ability to get this done.\u201d Responding to listeners\u2019 calls, Johnson defended his tenure as London mayor, and as foreign secretary, repeating his contentious claim that a gaffe he had made about the status of the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had made no difference to her plight. On tax, Johnson dismissed an analysis that his plan to raise the earnings threshold for the higher 40p rate of tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 would most benefit the richest 10% of households, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t recognise those figures.\u201d Johnson indicated any future tax policy would be more broad, saying: \u201cWe will bring forwards a tax proposal that actually begins by lifting thresholds for those on lowest pay.\u201d In response to another question, he dismissed the idea of links to Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s controversial former campaign manager, as \u201cthe biggest load of codswallop I have ever heard\u201d. Video footage of Bannon has emerged in which he discusses having had regular consultations with Johnson last year. Johnson said: \u201cIt is perfectly true that when the president came to this country last year, Steve Bannon texted me on a couple of occasions, trying to fix a meeting. I texted back to say it was not possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
