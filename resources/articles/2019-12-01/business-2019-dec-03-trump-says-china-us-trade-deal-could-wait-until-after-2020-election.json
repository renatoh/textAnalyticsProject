Speaking at the Nato summit in London, the US president said the US was doing \u201cvery well\u201d from the trade war and he was in no hurry to sign an agreement before he runs for re-election next November. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s better to wait until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now,\u201d he said. The FTSE 100 dropped 1.75%, or more than 100 points, and US stock markets were also sharply lower, the Dow Jones ended down over 1%, as traders digested the president\u2019s view that the uncertainty surrounding the US-China trade talks \u2013 which have been blamed for cutting global trade growth by as much as three-quarters since 2017 \u2013 could drag on into 2021. Trump accused China of \u201cripping off the US for many, many years\u201d, and said it was desperate to end the trade war, which he claimed was hurting Beijing much more than Washington. In recent weeks the White House has sent mixed signals about progress towards a comprehensive trade deal between the US and China. Last month, Chinese officials said they were on course to sign a first-stage deal with the US, and Washington\u2019s silence was read as tacit approval. But only days later Washington made it clear that the two sides were still at odds and a deal depended on further concessions from Beijing. Trump\u2019s comments came only hours after he proposed import tariffs on French goods of more than \u00a31.8bn in retaliation for a new tax imposed by Paris on the sales of digital services providers. The US president said France had been wrong to hit American tech firms with a 3% levy on their global revenues. Trump denied he was \u201cin love\u201d with Facebook, Google and Twitter. But he said they were \u201cour companies, American companies\u201d, and he would defend them from punitive taxes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anyone take advantage of American companies. If anyone is going to take advantage of American companies, it\u2019s going to be us,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want France to be taxing American companies. If anyone\u2019s going to tax American companies, it\u2019s us. So we\u2019re putting a tax on their [France\u2019s] wines and everything else.\u201d Trump also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying that sometimes he did things that were \u201ccounterproductive to his country\u201d. More than 60 French products, covering food, drink, fashion, cosmetics and accessories, could incur a 100% tariff. The list also includes \u201csparkling wine, made from grapes\u201d, which appears to cover France\u2019s champagne production as well as cr\u00e9mant wines from other regions. Lipstick, eye makeup and various soaps also appeared on the list of products that the credit ratings agency S&amp;P said were worth \u00a31.83bn in the 12 months to 30 September. \u201cThat was equivalent to 4.1% of total imports from France over the same period. The largest import lines were: beauty products worth $842m and dairy products worth $202m,\u201d S&amp;P said. The list also targets handbags and cast-iron table and kitchen products, which is likely to cover Le Creuset and similar products. The US trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer said the government was exploring whether to open similar investigations into the digital services taxes of Austria, Italy and Turkey. \u201c[We are] focused on countering the growing protectionism of EU member states, which unfairly targets US companies,\u201d Lighthizer said. His statement made no mention of proposed digital taxes in Canada or Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
