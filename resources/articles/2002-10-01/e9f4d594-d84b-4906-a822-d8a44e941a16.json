A high court judge allowed the takeover to go ahead by ordering the lifting of the administration order on Railtrack obtained a year ago because of the company's insolvency. Mr Darling sought discharge of the administration order - obtained by his predecessor, Stephen Byers, a year ago after Railtrack's request for further funding was refused - which had put the company in the hands of accountants KPMG. His counsel, David Richards QC, told Mr Justice Ferris in London that the minister was satisfied on the evidence from KPMG and Network Rail that the takeover of Railtrack would put the company on a \"sound financial footing\". He said this view was supported by a review of revenue currently being carried out by rail regulator Tom Winsor. Proposed short, medium and long term financing amounted to around \u00a321bn, Mr Richards said. The sale agreement was approved by shareholders of Railtrack Group by an overwhelming majority in July and there was no opposition from creditors to the lifting of the administration order to allow the sale to go ahead. Mr Richards asked the judge to order the discharge to take place at 7am on Thursday. The only creditor represented in court was St Paul International Insurance, the insurer of various train operating companies which had claims outstanding against them, following a number of rail accidents. The company is seeking to recover the claims from Railtrack. Railtrack disputed those claims, amounting to \u00a352m, and the question of liability would not be determined until well beyond 2004, said Mr Richards. Announcing the court move last week, Mr Darling said: \"A year ago it was obvious that Railtrack could not have carried on as it was. The government had to take decisive action and build a structure that gave our railways stability. \"If the judge decides to lift the administration order the final piece of the new structure will be put in place. We supported Network Rail's take-over because passengers demand and expect more. \"That is why we are also committed to investing almost \u00a365 billion into rail. If the court agrees to lift the order the structure will be in place to ensure that money is invested efficiently and effectively. \"It will then be up to the rail industry to get on and deliver the improvement passengers expect. Everyone should feel the benefit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
