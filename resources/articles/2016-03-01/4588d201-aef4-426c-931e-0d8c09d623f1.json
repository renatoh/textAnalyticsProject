Titled Feeling Ourselves? Black Girl Power in Music, the panel ranged over subjects including Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation, Nicki Minaj\u2019s complaint over not being nominated for an award at the VMAs, and how Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk would never have been a large hit if it had been made by black artists \u2013 despite being, as one panelist said, a conspicuous throwback to black soul musicians such as the Time. The participants were Jane\u00e9 Bolden of black entertainment site Bossip, Whitney-Gayle Benta, senior vice-president of Sean Combs\u2019 music channel Revolt TV, and author and former music business executive Shanti Das. The panel was moderated by Kimberly C Ellis, famous on Black Twitter as Dr Goddess. The discussion kicked off discussing the #BlackGirlMagic hashtag that all the participants agreed was an inspiring and necessary celebration of black womanhood from Misty Copeland, the first African American woman to become principal dancer of American Ballet Theater, to Serena Williams. Ellis summed up the feeling behind it: \u201cYou suffered through the four levels of oppression \u2013 racism, class, sexism and poverty \u2013 and you still did all that? Girl, that\u2019s magic!\u201d When asked whether black women would get riled by a #WhiteGirlMagic hashtag, Bolden made the obvious but necessary point that oppressed communities have to fight to have their achievements recognised: for instance, white women are accepted as the standard of beauty. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to develop a show about white girls because there\u2019s a show called Girls and they\u2019re all white,\u201d Ellis pointed out. However, the panel had warm words about the show Girlfriends, which ran until 2008 and featured a variety of black women, and pointed out how many African American women loved The Golden Girls. The panel went on to discuss the \u201cplayful sexuality\u201d of Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicki Minaj\u2019s video for Feeling Myself, noting that it featured two women not looking for male approval. This segued into a discussion about solidarity between black women in the workplace, with Bolden saying there is a \u201csorority atmosphere\u201d at her workplace. \u201cWe love and support each other,\u201d she said. Ellis noted that arguments between men are rarely gendered in the way that disagreements between women are, still often dismissed as \u201ccatfights\u201d. The discussion then turned to cultural appropriation and whether Nicki Minaj had been justified in citing race as a factor in her video for Anaconda not getting nominated for a major award at the VMAs last year. Bolden pointed out that Kanye West was pilloried for interrupting Taylor Swift\u2019s speech at the 2009 VMAs, yet nobody even remembers the video she won for (You Belong to Me) whereas Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Single Ladies, the video she beat, to West\u2019s indignation, is a classic. Das suggested that white artists such as Sam Smith and Adele have exposure and opportunities that black performers such as Tyrese are still denied, confined to black radio stations. She doubted that Uptown Funk would have been anywhere near the smash it has been had the song been performed by the band she said it was indebted to \u2013 the Time, the Prince affiliates whose lineup included Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who went on to produce and co-write huge hits for artists including Janet Jackson and Alexander O\u2019Neal. \u201cThings have been stolen from us for years,\u201d Das said. Pointing out that white fraternity brothers at Georgia Tech now listen to trap music, and that hip-hop has broken down walls between different communities and \u201chelped us to understand each other\u201d, she had a request to white audiences and musicians: \u201cDon\u2019t act like you started it.\u201d Asked by an audience member what black men could do to assist with black women\u2019s emancipation, Das said: \u201cStop calling us bitches and hoes.\u201d Das and Bolden both detailed poor treatment by men \u2013 often artists \u2013 in the music industry who would make unwanted sexual advances towards them. Ellis also pointed out that white women are rarely degraded by rappers. When Snoop makes a record with Katy Perry for instance, it\u2019s an uplifting or inspiring one. She also pointed out that TI had defended Iggy Azalea \u2013 but the number of men publicly willing to defend black women are few and far between. The panel ended on an uplifting note, with Ellis imploring the audience to reject the Madonna/whore dichotomy and embrace and expand a feminism that respects women\u2019s whole identities. Women, she said, were conditioned to be exploited, and men were conditioned to exploit them. However, the panel had illustrated that it didn\u2019t need to be that way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
