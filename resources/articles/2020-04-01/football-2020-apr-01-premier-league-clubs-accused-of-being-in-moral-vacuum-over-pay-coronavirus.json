Before a meeting on Wednesday at which the Premier League, English Football League and Professional Footballers\u2019 Association will continue talks regarding pay, there was outspoken criticism from politicians. Julian Knight, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: \u201cIt sticks in the throat. This exposes the crazy economics in English football and the moral vacuum at its centre.\u201d Tottenham said on Tuesday they had reduced the wages of their 550 non-football staff by 20%, in some cases by placing them on furlough. Newcastle and Norwich have furloughed non-playing staff. Norwich said they would \u201ctop up\u201d the wages their staff receive under the government\u2019s furlough scheme to provide their usual salary in full. Under the scheme the government will pay staff 80% of their wages, to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. The Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, said when announcing his club\u2019s move that top-flight managers and players should help English football deal with the financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic by accepting lower pay. It is understood the Premier League will report back to its clubs at Friday\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting before confirming any agreement on deferrals. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cHighly-paid football players are people who can carry the greatest burden and they should be the first one to, with respect, sacrifice their salary, rather than the person selling the programme or the person who does catering or the person who probably doesn\u2019t get anywhere near the salary Premier League footballers get.\u201d The PFA is understood to be resisting deferment of players\u2019 wages until negotiations have been held with clubs individually demonstrating cash flow problems and a genuine need to make savings now. The players\u2019 union is also understood to be resistant to pay cuts, being prepared to discuss only deferments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
