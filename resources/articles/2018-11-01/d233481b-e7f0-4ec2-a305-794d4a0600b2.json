Kane has had his form and fitness questioned this season, having led England to the World Cup semi-finals in the summer and then, after a three-week holiday, gone straight into the new Premier League campaign. He has started in all of Tottenham\u2019s league and Champions League fixtures. The assessment of Kane has largely mirrored that of his team \u2013 good, at times, but still to really click. And yet, almost under the radar, he took his tally to 10 from 15 matches in all competitions on Tuesday with the late goals that secured the 2-1 Champions League win over PSV Eindhoven. \u201cHarry is a killer, an assassin,\u201d Pochettino said, before the visit to Crystal Palace on Saturday. \u201cHe\u2019s always in practice and he wants to kill the keeper. You need to stop him from training because he always wants to train. He is so obsessed with scoring that sometimes, when it is against him, he needs more freedom \u2013 not to be obsessed. But he is going to learn and he is starting to be really mature. \u201cKane is English and sometimes you push him to the sky and paradise and then you put him on the outside. If Harry was Italian and playing for the Italian side, he would be a bit more protected because the Italian people are more protective of their players. It\u2019s difficult to push them but when they are there, they try to keep them up there. It\u2019s similar in Spain. Here, it is more up and down.\u201d Pochettino sees parallels between Kane and his former Argentina teammate Gabriel Batistuta. \u201cHis mentality is similar. Maybe Harry is going to improve on Batistuta\u2019s stats. I know Batistuta very well and I know Harry. They are of a similar mind, focus and determination.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
