But I like it, and boats, the sea, boy's own adventure stories, all that stuff - especially if I'm warm and dry, on the sofa, with a gin and tonic in one hand and the remote control in the other. So today I'm reviewing Ocean Rescue: The Race Against Time (More4). If you don't like it, tough. So there's this sailing race, the Velux 5 Oceans - single-handed, round-the-world - and there are a couple of British guys in it called Alex Thomson and Mike Golding. I know you've never heard of them, but they're big in the yachting world, and they were two of the favourites to win the race. It's quite good, too, because they hate each other's guts - Mike even called Alex \"a prick\" in an interview before the race. That's not bad for a yachtie. So they're kind of like sailing's George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, and they're off for a rumble on the ocean wave. Excited yet? Anyway, it turns out that they're a bit rubbish, or their boats are rubbish, because while the rest of the fleet sails off down the Atlantic, Alex and Mike both have to head straight back into port for repairs. By the time they start again, the others are such a long way off that it's become a race within a race, two Brits bravely battling it out for last place. And still hating each other's guts. Then, disaster: Alex loses his keel (careless) in the Southern Ocean and has to abandon his boat. Of course, the only person near enough to rescue him is Mike, who in truth probably wouldn't mind if Alex ended up in Davy Jones's locker. But in times like these, seafaring types forget their differences, and Mike gamely goes back to rescue his old adversary. And, while they may not appear to be very good at sailing round the world, these two, they're pretty media-savvy and keep their cameras rolling. Maybe they were thinking that if they could salvage a More4 documentary from the race, then their sponsors might not cut them adrift. During the rescue, the commentary continues to remind us how bitter both the sea and the rivalry between the two men is, and does its very best to keep up the excitement: \"It's a last resort, but it's his only option ... the situation is getting critical ... any delay could be fatal ... one of the most remarkable rescues ever made.\" Is it really one of the most remarkable rescues ever made? There are a few problems: Mike's engine breaks down (are these boats really fit to go round the world?), there is trouble in getting the rope to Alex in his life raft, his finger gets hurt, and his feet get cold. But it's hardly up there with Shackleton, is it? Or even Tony Bullimore. (Remember him - that bloke who spent days in his upturned boat, also in the Southern Ocean, not knowing if anyone was coming to get him?) Anyway, it's too easy to be sneery about it, sitting here cosily, a very long way from the Southern Ocean. And I was still totally absorbed because, as I said, I'm into this stuff. Also, they're now best mates. Mike doesn't call Alex a prick any more, so there's even a happy human story there, too. Well done, everyone. What a cop-out Vic Reeves is, in The Truth About Food: How to Be Sexy (BBC2). He goes all the way to LA, to find out what smells turn guys on. And then he won't let the science dude in the caravan put a penile clamp on him, to measure the blood flow. Why won't he let a stranger in a caravan play around with his genitals? Maybe it's something his mother warned him about. Anyway, they find some other, less prudish, volunteers. And guess what aroma gives the Brits the raging horn? Apple cake and custard. There's something quite comforting about that. We also learn that, if you're a woman, and you're finding it hard to get in the family way, then smoothies may be the answer. Not chaps with silver tongues, who are going to talk their way into your knickers; but fruit, all bashed up in a liquidiser, then fed to your boyfriend over a six-month period. It will help repair any DNA damage to his sperm apparently, turning it from rubbish semen (or Thomson-Golding, as it's known in yachting circles) into able semen.
