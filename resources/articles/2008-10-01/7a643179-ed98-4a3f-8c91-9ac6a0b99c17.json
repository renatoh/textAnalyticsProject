Which would be wrong, clearly, because not only was the film originally conceived by Paul Haggis as a TV series, it is now on the small screen, appearing on the horrifically-named STARZ channel. But according to the majority of US critics this week, it was perhaps a bad idea, after all. \"It's an hour of unpleasant yet bland people occasionally bumping into each other and saying racially provocative things\", was the verdict of Alan Sepinwall in the Newark Star-Ledger. Which, at least, sounds like it's being faithful to the movie. Or at least to the bit I remember before falling asleep. \"Thus far, it seems as if 'Crash' is exploiting the film's lesser elements. The acting lacks nuance, and frequently goes over-the-top,\" said John Serba from Mlive.com. He goes on to conclude that the show is \"as much fun as a freeway pile-up\". Geddit? Because it's called Crash, yeah? Ah, it's always more fun when television-makers make life easier for critics by laying out metaphor in the show's title, isn't it? (The poorly received Worst Week remake has been finding it's own title damning it to hell in many reviews. You'd think television people would be more careful with that kind of thing.) Granted, you can't title everything \"An Enjoyable Half-Hour of Television\" in the hope that people will mash up the title with the content in their minds, but still, don't hand them it on a plate if you can avoid it. It's not like car-crash television wasn't a phrase before this show came along. Better to avoid the car metaphors altogether if you want to be truly original when reviewing the show, it turned out. Like Entertainment Weekly, who managed to pan it in no uncertain terms, without a wheel rim in sight: \"The film's episodic, interwoven tales of race relations in L.A. become a swampy mess of ludicrous dialogue, disconnected characters, and offensively stupid plotting.\" Ouch. Nothing left but to sit around and think of films that might make good television series instead (apart from 10 Things I Hate About You, I mean, they're already doing that). It's difficult to think of one that should, though. What about Snakes on a Plane? Yes, it's difficult to see how you could stretch it more than one series, but then you could have Snakes on a Train, Snakes in the Rain; Snakes in a Box, Snakes on a Fox. It almost writes itself: three, four seasons, easy. Elsewhere, there has been a buzzing around the blogs recently that NBC might be talking about a return of the characters that made Will &amp; Grace what it was: Jack &amp; Karen. The news of a potential spin-off has basically been received in a wary but generally hopeful fashion, so let's wait and see. It does bring to mind the question, though, of what Will &amp; Grace are themselves doing at the moment, Well, allow me to help: Will, aka Eric McCormack, is returning to the screen in January with Trust Me, a comedy in which he stars with Tom Cavanaugh (the bloke from Ed, JD's brother in Scrubs etc) about partners in a Chicago advertising firm. Debra Messing (Grace), meanwhile, has returned to The Starter Wife - a series about a privileged Hollywood type trying to rebuild her life after divorce. I understand that that description makes it sound unremittingly terrible, but it's not that bad: think of it as Californication without as much swearing. Or sexing. Or loose morality in general. Yeah, it's actually not that much like Californication on reflection. It IS quite fun, though, in it's own way; my only main problem being the extreme soft-focus of the camera. I keep expecting to turn over one week an find Messing's face completely unrecognisable due to the two-inch layer of petroleum jelly covering the lens. Not strictly US TV, I know, but it's still ace - I only just became aware that the Evil League of Evil had been accepting video applications from hopeful Supervillains. If you haven't already, it's well worth watching some of the entries. I'm a particular fan of Tur-Mohel, myself. One tiny thing more, and I'm done. Just in case you haven't seen this Spanish site that has done things like go through the Simpsons' pop-culture references and match them, shot for shot, to the things they were referencing. One of those labours of love that at once astounds you and makes you wonder why you don't have a life with that much time on your hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
