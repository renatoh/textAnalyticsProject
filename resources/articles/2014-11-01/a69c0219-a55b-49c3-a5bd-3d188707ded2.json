Back then there were three black managers across 92 clubs in the Football League and Premier League. Incredibly, a decade on there are two. For a group that makes up almost 30% of the players on the pitch, the numbers are disturbing. The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has shared a snapshot of data from early 2013 showing that the problem extends to backroom staff roles \u2013 physios, goalkeeping coaches, academy directors, Under-21s\u2019 coaches and technical directors \u2013 where BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) employees make up less than 4%. As the Football League prepares to commence its long-awaited review on the subject, the Observer examines an issue that is threatening to undermine the integrity of the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d says Jason Roberts, voicing the frustration of many leading black figures in the game. \u201cIn the future we\u2019ll look back at this, like we have with many things in history, and just feel ashamed that we\u2019re in this situation in 2014, that we\u2019re even discussing this.\u201d While some interpret the lack of BAME employees in strategic roles as somehow distinct from racism in football, Roberts believes it is all part of the same spectrum of prejudice. \u201cThis whole narrative about black players not being management material is a drip, drip effect,\u201d he says. Last month Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said: \u201cThere is no racism in football \u2026 If you are good, you get the job.\u201d Roberts believes black managers are good enough but that there is prejudice at work. \u201cIt starts when black players are characterised by their athletic ability. You will not hear a black player referred to in the same sentence as the words \u2018intelligent\u2019, or \u2018technique\u2019. It\u2019s always power and pace. This narrative goes right the way through. We\u2019ve seen it in the past \u2013 \u2018black players are not good in the cold\u2019, \u2018not good at certain positions\u2019. You can see how the decision-makers look at it and say: \u2018Well, he\u2019s just not the type.\u2019\u201d The former Arsenal midfielder Paul Davis is no stranger to that kind of rhetoric. The former academy coach says he was once passed over for promotion in favour of a less experienced candidate and told he had the wrong \u201cpersonality\u201d \u2013 though there is no suggestion that Arsenal did anything wrong, and their record in tackling racism is exemplary. In 2003, Davis joined the PFA as a coach educator and ever since he has been working on the issue. While the rest of football are still trying to get their heads around positive action, at the PFA it has been part of their discussions for years. \u201cIt was 2003,\u201d says Davis. \u201cRicky Hill [the former Luton midfielder, now coaching in the US] came into a meeting we had on this issue and said there\u2019s a thing happening in America in the NFL called the Rooney rule and why don\u2019t we look into it? We\u2019ve been in constant discussion with the NFL ever since.\u201d After 11 years working on this, Davis struggles to fathom the lack of action from football\u2019s key stakeholders. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk. We\u2019ve had meetings with the FA, the Premier League, the Football League. Everyone\u2019s said \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s look into this\u2019, but then nothing happens.\u201d What upsets Davis is the poor representation of the Rooney rule argument in the media. \u201cPeople think the black candidate will get an interview without any qualifications or ability,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also been a perception that black players aren\u2019t interested in going into management. But that\u2019s not the reality. They had just become really distrusting of how it all works.\u201d While Roberts says black players\u2019 chances of becoming a manager are currently \u201cslim to none\u201d, there is a group of players coming through who refuse to be swayed by the statistics. Tom Huddlestone, Liam Rosenior and Danny Webber are studying for their coaching badges, determined to carve a career out of coaching. For Rosenior, becoming a manager has been a lifelong ambition. As early as 10 years old he was producing scouting reports for his dad, the former Torquay manager Leroy Rosenior. Articulate and bright, the Hull defender discourses on everything from Pep Guardiola\u2019s football philosophy to the civil rights movement in the US. You can see why Steve Bruce has tipped the 29-year-old as management material. \u201cMy passion is football,\u201d says Rosenior, who, along with Huddlestone, is studying for his Uefa A license, while gaining experience coaching the Under 21s and reserve teams at Hull. \u201cI love the game, I think about it 24/7. The natural progression for me is to become a manager and hopefully one at the highest level.\u201d Rosenior says he spends much of his time developing his philosophy on how the game should be played. He is in a hurry to learn his trade before he retires and football forgets him. He hopes for a \u201cseamless transition\u201d into management. While Rosenior acknowledges the debate around black managers \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve talked about the Rooney rule in the Hull dressing room\u201d \u2013 he is not a supporter of positive action. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to black players who played for England about what I want to achieve and they said, \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019ve got no chance of getting a job.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing. You have to put yourself out there. It\u2019s a negative stain on the culture of football if we have to implement a Rooney rule. I don\u2019t think the Rooney rule is going to make a difference. There has to be a mindset where you see someone and want to give them the job, instead of just having that token black character that gets an interview just because the game has to fulfil obligations.\u201d Roberts says he recognises Rosenior\u2019s drive in his younger self, but that the dynamics change in management. \u201cOn the meritocracy of the football pitch you can say: \u2018I\u2019m going to score a hat-trick, you cannot deny that I\u2019m a good player.\u2019 The elephant in the room where management and coaching is concerned is how can you be a good player if you\u2019re not allowed access to the pitch? That is what you\u2019re fighting against. You can have all the determination you want, you can do all the training sessions you want, but the statistics say that you are at such a disadvantage to your white peers that it is a leap of faith for you to even take your badges.\u201d As the debate over the Rooney rule rumbles on, Professor Ben Carrington, a specialist in race and sport, condemns the inertia of the English football authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that there\u2019s a discussion in England that is 20 years behind the times about moving to something the US has already said hasn\u2019t done enough. It\u2019s remarkable to hear Richard Bevan [the League Managers Association chief executive] saying: \u2018We\u2019re not too sure about affirmative action, do we really need it?\u2019 We needed it 20 years ago. Absolutely something like the Rooney rule should be in place, and it\u2019s a scandal and a disgrace the lack of serious attention given by football\u2019s key stakeholders to address this issue.\u201d Carrington, who was once a semi-professional footballer in England but now lectures at the University of Texas, is well placed to understand the cultural nuances on both sides of the Atlantic. He acknowledges the question over whether an American invention can translate into English football culture. \u201cIt\u2019s true, they\u2019re different, a simple adoption of the Rooney rule might not work. But is that used as an excuse for not taking action? The Rooney rule sounds foreign because it is foreign. So let\u2019s rename it.\u201d He laughs and adds: \u201cThe key thing to learn from the Rooney rule is that without outside pressure sports organisations do not change.\u201d Davis and Roberts agree, calling on high-profile players to bring their voices to bear. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where the chances of people breaking through are so slim that people are more ready to talk,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cThey recognise that the governing bodies and people who are meant to be driving this issue have no stomach for this fight.\u201d Heather Rabbatts, a Football Association board member, is one of the few exceptions. As a mixed-race woman, a minority on the FA board in both senses, Rabbatts is clear on the challenges BAME candidates face and describes football as a \u201cclosed shop\u201d. She says the FA are working to change their structures \u2013 adding BAME representation to selection boards to improve the numbers on the FA-run, invitation-only Pro License course. \u201cWe\u2019re all signed up to inclusion but you can\u2019t have inclusion without representation. Where we can see there are obstacles for the development of black coaches and managers we should all be committed to removing those barriers.\u201d With BAME candidates accounting for 18% of PFA coaching course numbers, Rabbatts understands one such barrier to gaining employment is lack of experience. \u201cAt the FA I\u2019m working on how we can develop a scheme for supporting black coaches in terms of experience and mentoring within the Club England structure, and I hope to be able to say more about that in the very near future. But it\u2019s also about clubs really embracing the development of black coaches and managers by offering opportunities for them, that\u2019s crucial.\u201d For some it\u2019s already too late. The former Newcastle defender Olivier Bernard always wanted to be a coach but says he was one of many black players put off by a lack of role models, despite taking his preliminary badges. \u201cWhy would I be the only one to succeed? It made me disheartened thinking I\u2019m never going to get a chance. You find that managers getting released by clubs get appointed by another club six months down the line, it\u2019s a cycle. And to break into that cycle is very difficult. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d Bernard ended up buying a football club last year, Durham City AFC, a rare example of a black chairman in English football. If the Rooney rule were introduced would he change his view on coaching? \u201cI would look to go back into coaching because there might be an opportunity then. Because then you have a chance.\u201d Rosenior would argue otherwise, but he still pauses on hearing the comments his father gave to this newspaper in 2004 about unconscious bias and chairmen appointing in their own image. \u201cIt\u2019s weird hearing that from my dad because my dad\u2019s been through it,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember going with him to games when he was manager of Gloucester and I saw how upset he was when they wouldn\u2019t believe that he was a manager and he tried to go into the other teams\u2019 boardrooms. I\u2019ve been through things with him that have maybe made me more determined to change it.\u201d Roberts believes the biggest problem lies with the attitudes of those in charge. \u201cIt is this arrogant undertone which is really hard to take,\u201d he says, citing the LMA\u2019s statement in response to the Iain Moody and Malky Mackay text messages, and the dismissal by the Football League chairman, Greg Clarke, of the \u201cshrill voices\u201d criticising his organisation for failing to address this issue at their AGM. Clarke proposed the Football League\u2019s review after the reaction to his comments. \u201cOccasionally they let you into their mindset, that\u2019s when you see that they genuinely don\u2019t understand the issue. I have no confidence in the game moving this issue along without the players or government driving this.\u201d Helen Grant, the minister for sport whose DCMS department has been sent the PFA\u2019s latest figures, is willing to lend that support. \u201cI want to see more from the game in getting black coaches through the ranks,\u201d she says. \u201cI want a talent pool of people from all walks of life qualified and knocking on the door for the top jobs in coaching. There needs to be greater diversity across the football administration landscape more generally, too, with more people from BME backgrounds helping to shape the sport.\u201d Rosenior, meanwhile, is confident he can play a significant role in moving the game forward on this issue. \u201cThe black players of the previous generations have opened the doors for players of my generation and we owe them a great deal of gratitude for that. Now is the next step to say who is going to open the door at management level? I hope I can be one of the first to do that.\u201d How NFL embraced the Rooney Rule What is the Rooney Rule? An NFL agreement since 2003 that all teams interview at least one black or minority ethnic candidate for head coach and general manager vacancies, though there is no compulsion to hire the candidate for any role. Why was it established? To ensure minority coaches were considered for high-level positions after a report in 2002 by lawyers Johnnie L Cochran Jr and Cyrus Mehri showed a \u201cdismal record of minority hiring\u201d for NFL head coaching positions. Although 70% of players were black, only 28% of assistant coaches and 6% of head coaches were African-American. Who is Rooney? Dan Rooney, now 82, owns the Pittsburgh Steelers and was chairman of the NFL\u2019s Workplace Diversity Committee, which looked at the report in 2002 and told teams they would be given a heavy fine if they did not interview at least one minority candidate. What happened next? Before the rule, there were six black head coaches in more than 80 years of the NFL; in the decade since, 13 have been hired. The 2007 Super Bowl was a landmark meeting of two teams coached by African-Americans as Tony Dungy\u2019s Indianapolis Colts beat Lovie Smith\u2019s Chicago Bears. Rooney\u2019s own team, the Steelers, were guided to the Super Bowl by Mike Tomlin the following year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
