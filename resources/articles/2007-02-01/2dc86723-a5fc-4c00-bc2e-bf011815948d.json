The four scientists responsible - Zahid A Khan, Irfan Anjum Badruddin, GA Quadir and KN Seetharamu - are based at universities in India and Malaysia. They infuse the report with abundant technical detail and occasionally strained grammar. Their method, they assure us, \"can be used by any user to predict quickly accurate amount of heat loss from a cow\". Inevitably comes the question: \"Why would someone want to estimate the heat losses from a cow?\" Khan, Badruddin, Quadir and Seetharamu provide an answer in their first paragraph. \"In order to increase milk yield of the cows,\" they write, \"it is necessary to cool them.\" The title, A Quick and Accurate Estimation of Heat Losses from a Cow, implies there is at least one other way to estimate the heat losses from a cow, and that other method suffers from slowness or inaccuracy, or both. The main one until now - the gold standard - was developed by Kifle G Gebremedhin of Cornell University in the US and Binxin Wu of Tongi University in China. The Gebremedhin-Wu method certainly is slow. Despite making a simple assumption - that a cow is a cylinder - it requires you to do some tedious calculating. Khan, Badruddin, Quadir and Seetharamu, in introducing their own method, pooh-pooh the Gebremedhin-Wu way. They say it involves complex computer programming and, moreover, is useless to people \"who do not possess adequate background of heat and mass transfer, in addition to the computer programming skill\". The old method involved measuring or calculating a whole herd of numbers: the cow's weight; the diameter the cow would have if it were a cylinder; the diameter of a typical hair; the fur density and the fur thickness; the ratio of fur to skin surface area; the coefficient of effective radiant area; the coefficient of radiant heat transfer; the radiant emissive coefficient of the skin; the thermal conductivity of the air and, separately, that of the fur layer. The new way is simpler. You measure or calculate just four things: wetness of the cow; air temperature near the cow; wind speed; and relative humidity. And then - the great triumph of the method - you look up the answer in a table. Khan, Badruddin, Quadir and Seetharamu have removed most of the tedium by doing the calculations for you. That's why you don't have to do the calculations yourself. This triumph of simplification is reminiscent of another study, also describing a new method to replace a tedious old one, and also performed in India. In 1990, KP Sreekumar and G Nirmalan of Kerala Agricultural University published a report called Estimation of the Total Surface Area in Indian Elephants. They reaped unexpected dividends 12 years later, when they received an Ig Nobel prize in the field of mathematics.
