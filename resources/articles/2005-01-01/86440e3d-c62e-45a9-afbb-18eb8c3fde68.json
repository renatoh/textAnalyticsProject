Fast forwarding a bit, there's a period as a centre of medieval civic administration - most famous, of course, for a little local difficulty that the Sheriff had with a certain Robin Hood - and then the industrial heyday of the 19th century, when Nottingham churned out lace like it was going out of fashion. Which in fact it was. So, following the inevitable decline, Nottingham picked itself up and is now a bustling, cosmopolitan city, not short of urban problems to be sure, but enjoyable and energetic. Gown Nottingham Trent, a 1992 university, is based at three campuses: City in the centre of town, Clifton campus, four miles away overlooking the Trent, and Brackenhurst, 10 miles away, which is home to animal, rural and environmental studies and boasts its own commercial farm and equestrian centre. The buildings at City campus are a mix of old and new: the Arkwright building was home to the university's Victorian predecessor (where DH Lawrence did his teacher training), but the \u00a313m Boot library, opened in 1998, is as hi-tech as you like. Brackenhurst has a lake and landscaped gardens. Top-rated teaching departments In the league tables, Nottingham Trent performs strongly in agriculture and forestry, pharmacology, maths and media studies. Top-rated research departments A fairly solid performance in the 2001 RAE. Drama, dance and performing arts; communication, cultural and media studies; English language and literature; and professions allied to medicine all get a 5 rating. Celebrity academics Dr Cerwyn Moore is an expert on war and terrorism with current research into female suicide bombers. Professor Mark Griffiths is similarly zeitgeisty, as Europe's only professor of gambling studies. Professor Robert Rees carries out research into cancer immunology. Head count Over 20,000 under- and postgraduates, 4,500 part-time undergraduates and 9,000 non-degree students. About 90% are from state schools. Academic pay Just about in the top third. Science and art lecturers on over \u00a331,000; engineering lecturers on more than 32,000. Climate Given that it's slap in the middle of the country, it's protected from the worst excesses of British weather. But don't forget your umbrella. Transport links City campus is a mile from the city centre, so easily walkable; the others are linked by frequent buses. The town is busy - lots of buses, trams soon, and your usual quota of traffic jams. Out of town, motorways are easily accessible. Rail links to Manchester and Birmingham are quick and there are frequent fast services to London. East Midlands International Airport is close by. Entertainment All the fun you'd expect in a city of this size: theatre, dance, musicals at the Nottingham Playhouse, the Nottingham Theatre Royal and the Royal Concert Hall. Lots of cinema, including the arty Broadway and the tiny Screen Rooms. Hockley, Goosegate and the Lace Market are nice areas for a browse and a coffee; plenty of swish bars and restaurants for the evening too. Nottingham Forest, Notts County and cricket at Trent Bridge for sports lovers. And for a taste of history, visit the Galleries of Justice, the Caves of Nottingham, Nottingham Castle, or the 700-odd-year-old Goose Fair. Schools The City of Nottingham LEA performs below average in the league tables, though there are perfectly decent schools to be found if you know where to look. For primary, try South Wilford Endowed CofE primary, or Fernwood junior school. For secondary, Fernwood school is a great option, or try Trinity Catholic school. The latter, or Bilborough college, for post-16. House prices Nothing too horrific: a detached house will set you back \u00a3217,000 on average, with semis and terraces at around \u00a3127,000 and \u00a3100,000. There's nice period property to be found, but naturally you'll pay a premium for the des reses.
