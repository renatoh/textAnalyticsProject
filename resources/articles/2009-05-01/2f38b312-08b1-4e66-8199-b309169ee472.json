I could apply the same simile to a different end: too much Holmes is no more likely than too much foie gras and no less desirable. From his first appearance in A Study in Scarlett , via his most famous adventures \u2013 The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Speckled Band \u2013 to his final appearances in the very short stories making up The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, his deductions never fail to raise a smile, while his personal life and sharp temper are much edgier than commonly remembered (not just because of the cocaine he injects). Having every Holmes story collected in one volume highlights how successful a rendition of Victorian life Conan Doyle provides. The cunning villains, dedicated servants and flustered clients flitting in and out of the detective's life give the opportunity for pen portraits worthy of a renowned caricaturist. Conan Doyle is less good when it comes to women, who tend to scheme more obviously than their male counterparts. However, there are exceptions, such as steadfast, suicidal Anna of \"The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\", and an occasional coquette is pleasing to discover. This book, with a rather cursory essay by PD James, is the first of two collections being published for Conan Doyle's 150th anniversary (the other, from Penguin in November, promises an introduction by James's friend and rival Ruth Rendell). It may not have been the memorial desired by Holmes's over-satiated author, but will delight his fans, even if the book's flimsy paper is reminiscent of a phone directory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
