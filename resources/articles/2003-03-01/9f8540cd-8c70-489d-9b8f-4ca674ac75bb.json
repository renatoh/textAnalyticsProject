Oh, and Thierry Henry, arguably the best player in the world at the moment, has shaken off a calf injury and will be running around the pitch a damn sight faster than the bloke marking him, 37-year-old Brazilian relic Aldair. Arsenal really need to win this or they're in bother. A draw or a defeat tonight and they'll need something in Valencia next week for sure. A win may still not be enough, although if Ajax beat the Spanish in Amsterdam, a victorious Arsenal would be able to start preparing for the quarter-finals. The more words I'm adding to this paragraph in the interests of clarity, the less clear it becomes ... so I'll stop now. 1 min: Cassano and Totti kick off. Roma, kicking towards the North Bank (is it still called the North Bank or have Sega or O2 co-opted it?) pass it about a bit. Arsenal can't get the ball for the first 80 seconds until it sails out for a goal kick. 2 min: Arsenal still can't get the ball. Cafu takes van Bronckhorst on down the right, beats him and sends in a low cross that's put out for a corner by Keown. From the set-piece, Totti finds some room in the box; his shot's blocked easily enough. My colleague Sean Ingle is emailing me from Selhurst Park, where he's covering the Crystal Palace v Ipswich game for the paper. Get on with your bloody work, Ingle. 4 min: It's been an uncertain start for Arsenal ... but it's they who make the goalkeeper work first. Bergkamp feeds Gilberto down the right; the Brazilian's cross finds Wiltord on the left-hand side of the six-yard box. He mis-hits it, but the ball balloons off the turf and nearly goes over the head of Pelizzoli, who punches over. The corner is inept. 6 min: Henry walks past Panucci and slips a ball to Wiltord down the left channel. He's free in the box and certain to score, but the Roma back four raise their arms as one and get a totally undeserved offside decision. Hoist by their own petard, anyone? 9 min: A break in play as Cassano falls over for no reason and limps off. \"Could you please not mention the Newcastle score as its on ESPN 2 and I'm taping it to watch after work and a swim in tropical waters? Or is that too much too ask?\" asks Una Burns. Yes it is, quite frankly. \"I live in Hawaii and you'll be more than welcome to visit if you oblige.\" Ah. My lips are sealed. 12 min: GOAL Arsenal 1 - 0 Roma. Henry floats in a poor free-kick from the left which is sailing harmlessly out of play until the drummer from The Strokes, no, sorry, Damiano Tommasi needlessly pops up and heads it out for a corner. From it, Van Bronckhorst's centre is easily headed down and in by Vieira, who's standing on the edge of the six-yard box. Exactly six yards away from Pelizzoli, who is rooted on his line. 15 min: Roma try to hit back immediately by winning a corner of their own, but the over-elaborate set play they try to work is worse than useless. 17 min: Nearly a second for Arsenal as a long pass from left to right by Vieira ends up at the feet of Bergkamp, clean through. But need I tell you that the Dutchman has no pace, and Candela is on hand to whip the ball away. 19 min: Nearly a second for Vieira as a beautiful Pires cross from the left drops enticingly on the head of the Arsenal captain, who powers the ball low and to the bottom-left-hand corner of Pelizzoli's goal; the keeper dives brilliantly to Banks the ball round the post. Henry's resulting corner is awful. 21 min: Totti runs straight into Keown and is told to calm down by the ref. 22 min: RED CARD! Totti sent off. Well I don't think much of the ref's powers of persuasion, that's for sure. Totti goes up for a high ball with hard man Keown - who goes down like a sack of spuds. Totti's on his way! But what's happened? Let's see. The Italian's elbow clatters into Keown's skull! Er, hold on, replays show the Italian's hand sort of stroking Keown's tough face. Not the smartest thing Totti's ever done, but he's unlucky to go here. 25 min: Bergkamp finds Wiltord one-on-one with Lima. Apart from the Roma keeper, they're the only two players in that half of the pitch ... so of course Wiltord runs gormlessly into Lima, who doesn't even know where the ball is, never mind Wiltord, and the chance is gone. 28 min: Cassano booked for dissent. On the touchline, Fabio Capello has gone as puce as a Ferguson. 29 min: Tommasi is high-kicked to the floor by van Bronckhorst, who is booked. This could get out of hand if Arsenal are not careful. Remember, they've got the lead and extra man. 31 min: Valencia are a goal up in Ajax. \"A couple of weeks ago, when describing Arsenal - Ajax, a GU match minute-by-minute match reporter was kind enough to point out for us Americans that Ajax was pronounced 'Eye-ax',\" writes Stacy Richardson. \"Anyway, I thought other Americans who are reading this might need to know where Roma are from. Of course, the more astute of you will laugh and say, 'You don't know what city Roma' represents?' I know, it's silly that a lot of Yanks don't know that 'Roma' means 'Florence' in English. But now I've set the record straight.\" 33 min: Bergkamp is brought down on the edge of the area. Henry's free-kick is terrible and straight into the keeper's arms. You mark my words, he's been so bad with his set pieces so far tonight that he's bound to score with one later. 35 min: Pires and Bergkamp combine for a lovely one-two in the Roma box, but then they try a three ... and the ball clanks off the back of Pires's boot and into touch. This game's gone off the boil a bit since the sending off. 36 min: Henry makes a run from left to right and feeds Wiltord cutting in. There's a chance here, but his shot is low and lame and easily cleared. 39 min: An Henry corner is missed by everyone apart from Pires, who scoops the ball home with all the grace of a Chris Marsden v Wolves. But there's no goal, because everyone's been pushing each other in the centre. \"Holy God almighty,\" writes Una Burns from Hawaii. \"Thanks for not mentioning the Newcastle score - unless you were being sarcastic. After 13 years in Yanksville it's hard to determine sarcasm/irony/legitimate targets for invasion.\" 42 min: This really should have been two, as Vieira crunches Tomassi with a massive tackle and sets Bergkamp free on the right. He's all alone and bearing down on Pelizzoli, but he loses his head and slaps the ball right across the face of goal. It just about goes out for a corner. Rick Buur has kindly sent me an email, but the third word was \"weblog\" so I'm afraid I didn't get to the end of it. 44 min: Not a lot going on here at the moment. There's been a goal in the Newcastle game, by the way, but I've promised Una so you'll have to go to the Inter v Newcastle report if you want to know what's going on. 45 min: GOAL Arsenal 1 - 1 Roma Well bloody hell, eh? Emerson picks the ball up in the left-back position, wanders to the halfway line and pings an up-and-under over the top of the Arsenal back four towards Cassano. When I say \"Arsenal back four\", I mean \"Cygan wandering around in a daze on his own\". Cassano's able to chest the ball down and round the advancing Seaman in one fell swoop, before rolling the ball into the net. Half-time: Arsenal 1 - 1 Roma That's your lot for the first half. What a dreadful lapse of concentration by the Arsenal back line. I would say game on for the second half, but if ten-man Roma get a point from this, they're still in the competition, so there's a fair chance it'll be defence all the way in the second 45. \"Obviously Stacy Robertson went to the same primary schools as George W,\" says Angus Mackaskill. \"Please tell him/her (and other Yanks) that Roma is the Italian name for the city we know in English as Naples.\" 46 min: And we're off again, Roma kicking towards that Basingstoke-on-stilts otherwise known as the Clock End. \"Surely Naples is the Italian for that lovely rural town of Atalanta that nestles on the Bulgarian-Swiss border?\" wonders Bruce Currie. 47 min: A piss-poor Cygan backpass leads to a Roma corner. From it, Arsenal streak down the pitch with Bergkamp and Wiltord combining; Wiltord's one-on-one down the left! Sadly, Pelizzoli is far too good for his weak shot. Actually, I'd be too good for that shot. Now, there's already been one goal in the San Siro - but have there two others in the first two minutes of this half? I can't possibly say because of Una. 50 min: Roma are having plenty of the ball here. Arsenal keep lumping it forward only to see Roma stream back at them. There's even a half-hearted shout for a penalty as the ball sails over the head of Keown, who runs shoulder-to-shoulder with Emerson and nudges him over. 52 - 54 mins: Wiltord free on the right yet again and yet again he blazes the ball over the bar. Less than 30 seconds later, Pires picks the ball up in the centre of the pitch, edges left to right slightly, leaves two Roma defenders sprawling on the floor, and blazes the ball over the bar. And another 30 seconds later! Henry is free and blazes blah zzzzz. 55 min: Bergkamp wastes a good chance to give the ball to Wiltord on the left by over-reaching to shoot himself. Arsenal are beginning to boss this, though. \"Never mind where Roma are from, I'm afraid I can't find Arsenal anywhere on a map,\" writes Bill Dornan, who may or may not have an agenda. \"Could you tell your more ignorant readers which town they represent? My mate says they are from Woolwich but I've never seen any football grounds there.\" 57 min: Ajax have equalised against Valencia. A goal apiece from each home side and Arsenal are through. 60 min: Cafu fouls Vieira. Bergkamp fouls Panucci. That's it really. Nothing much going on at present. \"The real mystery is why Una, after 13 years in Hawaii, is still interested in anything to do with Newcastle,\" opines Matthew Sandiford. \"Surely she'd be better rewarded supported the local university's teams, which are saucily nicknamed the Rainbow Warriors.\" 62 min: Goalscorer Cassano goes off, Vicenzo Montella comes on. \"While we're educating our US friends about European clubs and cities, Arsenal's next match is against Valencia, that beautiful Spanish coastal city we English speakers know as Barcelona,\" writes Simon Barrett, from Andalucia in southern France. 64 min: Candela brings down Bergkamp just outside the Roma box on the right-hand side. Henry taps the ball to van Bronckhorst, who larrups the ball goalwards. It spoons up off a Roma defender and towards Keown's head, but the big defender's looping attempt is weak and Pelizzoli claims. Observation: if Keown had moved upwards at the same speed he'd gone downwards when Totti was sent off, it'd now be 2-1. \"Aren't Arsenal from the Italian Alps?\" asks historian/geographer Stacy Richardson \"I seem to remember paratroopers having invaded their fortress during WW2.\" 67 min: Nice series of one-twos between Pires, Henry and van Bronckhorst on the left-hand edge of the Roma area, but the final shot from the Dutchman is poor. \"And what is the English name for the city the Italians know as Napoli?\" asks Charles Goddard of Angus Mackaskill, totally losing me. 69 min: Roma are beginning to get a bit of territorial possession here. If Candala had managed to toe-poke the ball past Keown, it'd be him and Montella v Seaman - but the defender does brilliantly to stall the charge. Then Cafu is in acres down the left, but he pulls his cross behind everyone. The crowd are getting nervy. 71 min: Montella runs at three Arsenal defenders down the right and wins a corner at the expense of Cygan. It's wasted. Arsenal subs: Bergkamp and Wiltord off, Ljungberg and the jug-eared diver on. 75 min: Arsenal can't get anything meaningful going. The crowd are very edgy here. \"When I lived in London, I used to be pissed off by American tourists like everyone else,\" writes Richard Allaway. \"Funnily enough, these days I get just as annoyed by smug Guardian-reading Brits.\" That's us told. Meanwhile, Andrew Hockley thinks the English name for Napoli is Al-Quds. 77 min: It nearly looked like a goal for the Arsenal as the ball clanks around the Roma box for an age and then falls at the feet of Ljungberg and Jeffers, who get in each other's way, allowing Pelizzoli time to come out and smother. The ball's lifted back into the danger zone but by then the Roma back four have pushed out and Jeffers is miles offside. 81 min: Roma are quite happy to sit back here. Arsenal are creating nothing. I am using far too many italics at the moment. According to Stacy, Napoli is not Al-Quds. \"Once known as Stalingrad, now it is called Coventry.\" 83 min: Lucky, lucky Arsenal. Cafu springs the home back line and scampers down the right. His cross to Montella on the six-yard box is perfect (sorry) but the striker heads over from point-blank range when it was easier to score. \"And yes I am also a smug Guardian-reading Brit,\" adds Richard Allaway. 85 min: Emerson nicks the ball from Vieira and storms forward. He finds Cafu free down the right again, but the normally skilful Brazilian momentarily turns into Emile Heskey and clunks the ball into the crowd with Montella standing palms-up in the centre screaming whatever the Italian is for \"WHY?!?\" 88 min: Kanu on, Lauren off. According to James Foster, the University of Hawaii, in fear of their reputation as \"fine red-blooded paragons of heterosexual prowess\", had their football team's name changed from Rainbow Warriors to the \"terrifyingly anodyne\" Warriors. 90 min: Arsenal are passing it about from side to side, for goodness sake. 90 min +1: There will be four extra minutes. Down the left, Kanu wins a corner off Panucci ... 90 min +2: ... from which Keown nearly scrambles home a winner at the far post. Down the other end, Cygan gives the ball away to Tomassi, who feeds Candela, who wins a corner ... 90 min +3: ... which is wasted. Then, what a chance for Henry, who gets the ball to feet in the Roma box. He ridiculously decides not to shoot, but can't beat his man on the outside and runs the ball out of play. Did I say \"arguably the best player in the world at the moment\" in the preamble? Oh dear. 90 min +4: Montella and Kanu have half-chances at either end which are fully wasted. Then the ref blows up. That's it. Full-time: Arsenal 1 - 1 Roma. Arsenal's third draw in three home second-phase games, and that's not really good enough. Still, with Ajax coming back for a draw in the other Group B match, one point next week at Hungarian champions Valencia will be enough. Anyway, here's my reward for not telling Una the Newcastle score. \"OK, the easiest way to get here is, mmmh, if you're flying outta Belfast avoid Brit Midlands, they can and they will leave you stranded there for nine hours, but they will give you 10 quid for your troubles which buys a lotta Maltesers. Somehow get yourself to Heathrow, take British Airways - they are jolly nice and react well to crying sobbing persons who have just missed all their flights making a quite long journey that few days longer, they also like Malteser bribes, handy that BM had indirectly provided them. Then it's easy, fly to San Francisco, get off there, I lived there for ages so I'll find someone to put ya up, then the following day get on United (not the manure version, the actual high-flying one) and fly direct to Keahole airport, it's easy really. See ya soon!\" Eh, thanks for that, Una. I'm sure I can't go wrong following those directions. Anyway, thanks for all your emails everyone. Don't eat too many spherical candies before bedtime.
