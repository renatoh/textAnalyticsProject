In a statement unprecedented for its strength of feeling, 21-year-old William, who was also speaking on behalf of his younger brother, showed his deep pain at Mr Burrell's recent revelations. The princes said the late Diana, Princess of Wales, would have been \"mortified\" at his actions if she were alive today. They called on him to put an end to his disclosures. Mr Burrell, who worked for the princess, has made a series of claims including one that Diana feared for her life and spoke of a plot to tamper with the brakes of her car. Prince William said in the statement released by Clarence House: \"We cannot believe that Paul, who was entrusted with so much, could abuse his position in such a cold and overt betrayal. \"It is not only deeply painful for the two of us but also for everyone else affected and it would mortify our mother if she were alive today and, if we might say so, we feel we are more able to speak for our mother than Paul. \"We ask Paul, please, to bring these revelations to an end.\" In his new book, Mr Burrell also claimed the Duke of Edinburgh wrote to Diana telling her he and the Queen \"disapproved\" of the Prince of Wales's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. It was reported that Prince Philip told Diana: \"I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind leaving you for Camilla.\" Much of the book appears to be based on letters written and received by Diana, as well as Mr Burrell's experiences and observations as the princess's butler and confidante. Mr Burrell also said that Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, wrote to his sister and expressed concern for her health. He is also alleged to have acknowledged that they had lost touch over the years in the letter. A Clarence House spokeswoman said Prince William's statement was aimed at drawing the line under Mr Burrell's allegations. \"It's telling Paul Burrell that they've had enough,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
