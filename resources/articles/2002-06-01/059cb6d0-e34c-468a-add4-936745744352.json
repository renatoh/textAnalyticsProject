Virender Sehwag? Dinesh Mongia, Yuvraj Singh? To a Kent medium-pacer known among the sharper tongued as the poor man's Andrew Flintoff, they were just some rich easy pickings. James Golding, he of the kindly face and chunky thighs, ripped through the Indian top order here and finished with four for 42, his best one-day figures. And together with Mark Ealham he bowled Kent to a surprising victory on a flat pitch. Just why the Indians, who play the first of their NatWest series games against England on Saturday, found Golding so irresistible is debatable. Maybe it was just his repetitive shortish balls off an unfeasibly slow action. Sehwag knocked him to mid-off; Tendulkar dragged him on to his middle stump with the toe of his bat; Mongia lifted him 20 yards behind his head where he was caught by a running Geraint Jones; and Yuvraj fell to what seasoned observers called a long hop. And after he had made the early incisions, an old hand, someone England could have done with in Cardiff, docked the tail. Good old Ealham. Last time India were here, for the World Cup, he nearly took England to victory against them at Edgbaston. But nearly was not nearly enough; England were knocked out and slowly, very slowly, Ealham has been put out to pasture. He now has to suffer jokes about spare tyres and cream-cake consumption in the county programme. But here he was the late match-winner, as a close-fought contest reached its climax. He took four for seven in 11 balls, including, crucially, Rahul Dravid, as well as tucking in four maidens, four more than anybody else in the game. He may be too late to come to Duncan Fletcher's party but he was not too late to spoil India's. It had all looked so unlikely when Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly walked out and put on 85 exhilarating runs for the first wicket. A six over backward point here, a cover drive from standing still there, Sehwag looked unstoppable until he fell for 45 to Golding's third ball. It was beautiful to watch but it wasn't good enough for John Wright, India's coach. \"A player like Sehwag has to go on,\" he said. \"It's no good getting 30s or 40s; when you're chasing 280 the top three have to take advantage.\" A little unfair, but the result was the right one for Kent's batsmen. Robert Key made his sixth consecutive one-day fifty, thudding his bat into the crease as if to dig a small flowerbed, and pulling Ganguly for six into the car park, and Andrew Symonds looked destined for a rapid century before setting off for a single that wasn't there. Spare some sympathy, though, for Tinu Yohannan, who had a horrible last over, the penultimate of the innings, as Ealham muscled in with the bat too - 2, 4, 1, 6, 6, 6 he swished. Ganguly manfully patted Yohannan's bottom in commiseration, but Yohannan did not look happy. More miserable still when the winning margin turned out to be 21, four less than Ealham walloped off that over. \u00b7 Worcestershire Royals swept to the top of the Norwich Union League with a four-run win over Warwickshire Bears at New Road. The Bears required a six from the final ball to win but, chasing the Royals' total of 232 for seven, they fell just short when the man of the match Shaun Pollock hit a single."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
