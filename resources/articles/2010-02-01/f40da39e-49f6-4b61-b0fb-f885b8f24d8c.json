Snow shovels and ice-melting salt are sold out everywhere, the district's schools are closed for the rest of the week and most of Congress is shut down. Supermarket shelves are being picked clean of fresh meat, milk, fruit and vegetables \u2013 although there seems little prospect of anyone starving as a result. (The Whole Foods near Dupont Circle last night was cleaned out of bananas, broccoli, bagels and Green and Blacks chocolate, which says a lot about the priorities of local customers.) But how bad have things got? Local supermarkets have sold out of condoms. And the area's roofs are caving in. Good news! This being America, souvenir t-shirts are on sale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
