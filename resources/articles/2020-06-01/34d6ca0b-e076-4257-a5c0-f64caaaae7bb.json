Instead \u2013 with no warning, or chance to buy water or use the toilet \u2013 she found herself on a four-hour bus trip to Rotorua, a city 225km away, to spend her quarantine there. When she tweeted about her experience \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s government had started to use hotels in Rotorua and the South Island city of Christchurch to quarantine returning travellers as Auckland reached capacity \u2013 it didn\u2019t take long for responders to chide Ellen for what they saw as complaining. \u201cStay away from us until you\u2019re declared safe,\u201d one wrote. \u201cSo sorry if we don\u2019t care about your food needs.\u201d It was just one example of the backlash from some quarters against New Zealanders returning to the country in search of safety from the pandemic raging on other shores. In a nation in the rare position of returning to normal life free from Covid-19, New Zealanders are roiling with anxiety as coronavirus cases ratchet up in other countries, fearing the virus could be imported here. And some would rather pull up the drawbridge. \u201cIt was just baffling to me that these very fundamental, basic human needs that people would be willing to deny those in others,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cBy no means have any of us been complaining about needing to quarantine, or the sacrifices or even the quality of quarantine. We just wanted to be told what was happening.\u201d New Zealand was, until just over a week ago, free of Covid-19 after the last remaining case in the country was declared recovered, and had recorded 24 consecutive days with no fresh instances of the virus, drawing global admiration for prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government. The nation has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in total, and 22 deaths. But over the past week, a slow trickle of cases has begun at the border - as Ardern and her officials warned it would - as the number of New Zealanders returning home increases. Quarantine hotels appointed to manage their two-week isolation are filling up - there were 4,200 people quarantined in the facilities as of Monday, Ardern said, with 900 more expected in the next two days. There are currently 11 active cases of Covid-19 in the country, with none in hospital - all of them returning travellers, and all but two diagnosed during routine testing at the quarantine hotels. Tensions among New Zealanders over some of the cases exploded last week when officials were forced to admit that two of them, women returning from Britain, had been allowed to leave quarantine early on compassionate grounds without being tested. Dozens of others were also allowed to leave facilities without testing before rules were tightened up, it was revealed. Now, resentment of new arrivals for - in the eyes of some - putting the country\u2019s Covid-19 elimination status in jeopardy, combined with anger at news outlets for reporting each new quarantine bungle and complaint, has proved a potent mix. \u201cEarly on, we predicted there would be much higher levels of anxiety, but people really pulled together as this \u2018team of five million,\u2019\u201d said Dougal Sutherland, the clinical practice manager at Victoria University\u2019s school of psychology, referring to the phrase Ardern had coined to unite New Zealanders during a strict national lockdown in March and April. \u201cOn the other side, it seems like there\u2019s a few fractures and splinters,\u201d he added. \u201cThat animosity towards returning New Zealanders who might have the coronavirus is part of a fight, flight or freeze response, and the fight response really activates that anger part of it.\u201d The country was on wartime footing, he said, and threats felt heightened. \u201cThe downside of the \u2018team of five million\u2019 is that we cast people as the out-group,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone coming in from the outside is a potential threat and we respond to them that way.\u201d Only New Zealanders, their immediate families, and certain essential workers are permitted to enter the country, Sutherland added: \u201cThey all have the right to be there.\u201d The rhetoric of national unity \u2013 New Zealand together against the world \u2013 that Ardern successfully deployed to manage the national lockdown has been a unique part of the country\u2019s response, other analysts said. \u201cIn New Zealand, we had enormous buy-in to this strategy that you don\u2019t see elsewhere,\u201d said Rodney Jones, an economist based in Auckland with Wigram Capital Advisors. \u201cYou read the British papers and you see enormous societal divisions.\u201d New Zealand had been \u201cable to fashion consensus\u201d about the need for a strict national lockdown, he said. \u201cAustralia has, but not to the same degree.\u201d Now, Jones said he understood the anger about new arrivals taking issue with their conditions. \u201cFor me that\u2019s people who finally make it to the lifeboat complaining they got wet,\u201d he told TVNZ on Monday. \u201cNew Zealand is the lifeboat.\u201d The government is considering making returnees pay for part of their quarantine and Jones said pressure would continue on ministers to do so. \u201cI have seen people saying that people in quarantine should be grateful to be put in these hotels that are paid for by the taxpayers,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cPeople have said that New Zealanders have made so many sacrifices, they were in lockdown for a month, so we just have to suck it up and deal with it.\u201d She and other returning travelers also made sacrifices during the crisis, she said; she had lost her job in London and spent three months in isolation with almost no human contact in order to stay distanced from a housemate who was flouting the rules. New Zealanders have a complicated relationship with the idea of living overseas; travel is considered a rite of passage for inhabitants of the small island nation, but there is resentment about it from some, said Sutherland, the psychologist. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s a little bit of that tall poppy syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to the phenomenon of high achievers being \u2018cut down to size.\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019ve been away and you\u2019ve come back and you think you\u2019re all that, but you\u2019re not, you\u2019re just one of us, so pull your head in a bit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
