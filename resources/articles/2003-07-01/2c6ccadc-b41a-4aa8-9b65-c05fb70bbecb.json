Mushtaq Ahmed, who many considered past his spin-by date, is playing with such effervescence that he could become the first bowler for five years to take 100 wickets in a county season. There is even excited chatter that he might deliver to his frustrated employers their first ever championship when, at the start of the season, the avoidance of relegation would have represented success. The history of Sussex, oldest of all county clubs, is made exotic by its Asian associations. Ranjitsinhji, Duleepsinhji, the Nawab of Pataudi, Imran Khan and others dazzle like silk saris among the white flannels of the native yeomanry. Add, now, the name of Mushtaq, whose 11 wickets against Warwickshire recently brought his total to 52 in seven championship matches; there are nine remaining, starting with Essex at Arundel today. Only five bowlers have taken 100 championship wickets since 1991, and Andy Caddick and Courtney Walsh were the last in 1998. The championship would be an even greater achievement, not least because Surrey are the best side in the land. At Hove headquarters the ground tilts sharply towards the sea like the deck of a stricken liner and the club has foundered with every voyage. Sussex are one of only four counties never to have won the championship, along with Somerset, Northamptonshire and Durham, though they have been runners-up seven times. Mushtaq's brilliant career at Somerset, for three years between 1993-95 and again in 1997, faltered in 1998 when he played only six championship matches, taking 14 wickets. His knee injury and worries about his wife's confinement did not help as he lost his sense of direction on and off the field. Then he lost his place in the Pakistan side and there was speculation that this social animal's evening schedule was not necessarily restricted to floodlit cricket. \"I had always been a Muslim,\" he says. \"I used to read the Koran - but not consistently. Now, I'm very much practising, with cricket and my religion. I pray five times a day and read the Koran every morning. I work very hard for two years and now God gives a reward. He wanted to see my patience. \"I played well for Somerset for four years. But what happened in 1998 was my fault and I regret it. I didn't have a good time. I was mentally not there. But I was upset to be away from my family at a bad time. \"Peter [Moores, the Sussex director of cricket] took a chance with me, a big gamble by offering me a job this summer. And I am determined to repay him.\" Pakistan cricketers, like middle-aged women, are notoriously difficult to nail on the trifling matter of age. His beard is flecked with grey and he admits to 33. He is unlikely to add to his 50 Test caps \"but I am deserving to play for Pakistan\". He adds: \"I want to play to 36 and then quit. I don't want to hear people saying: 'What shall we do with the Mushy?' \"I want two more good years in England. This is my second home. I've had 10 years here, if you count five seasons with Somerset, three tours with Pakistan and some league cricket. \"We can win the championship. We're all believing in it. And I want my 100 wickets. That's 48 in nine matches. I just need two top games, maybe 12 wickets and a 10, and I'm halfway there. My flipper is my stock ball. But my leg-spinners and googlies get the wickets.\" Moores played against Mushtaq a decade ago and says: \"Leg-spinners get better all the time. They're still getting better when their bodies give out. I just love watching Mushy bowl: leggies, big leggies, googlies, top-spinners, flippers - all just rolled off his fingers. \"He contains, because he doesn't bowl bad balls. He gets them in the business area and that allows us to get men round the bat and create real pressure. \"He makes such a difference because now we can open up sides on flat pitches. We decided to play more aggressive cricket this season but we didn't expect to have won four and lost three from seven. Mushy's been brilliant. \" There is also title talk from the impressive Moores. \"We've got to have a chance, being second after seven games,\" he says. \"We've been playing for a couple of months now. We're bowling good sides out. We haven't dropped a bowling point yet.\" He wants to give credit to his other bowlers too, particularly James Kirtley, and his batsmen. But the chirpy, chuckling figure of Mushtaq remains pivotal. Here is a cricketer who appears to have achieved a certain epiphany; he's a rounded man, in every sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
