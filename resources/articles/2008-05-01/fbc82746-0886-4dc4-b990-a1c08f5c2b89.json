Forces across the country report 5,891 females were detained for the offence last year, compared with 3,847 in 2003/04. Twenty one forces found an increase and 15 found the figures static or lower, according to a survey by Channel 4 News. Chief Constable Mike Craik of Northumbria police, where arrests of drunken women rose from 1,414 to 2,101, said: \"More still needs to be done, particularly about underage drinking. \"That may well include rigorous action on the price of alcohol, a ban on advertising, increased education around the harm it can do, external regulation or even taking a uniquely harmful substance out of the normal retail chain. \"There should also be an end to discounted drinks, such as two-for-one deals, happy hours and supermarkets selling alcohol at below cost prices. There should be a ban on the sale of alcopops and no advertising of alcohol.\" The chief executive of Alcohol Concern, Don Shenker, said: \"There's no doubt that the number of women binge-drinking has gone up - they are following the example of young men. The trouble is that women's bodies cannot handle these large amounts of alcohol.\" Some of the biggest increases were in Leicestershire (from 14 arrested for being drunk and disorderly in 2003/04 to 77 last year), Cheshire (from 85 to 200), West Yorkshire (from 528 to 981), Dyfed-Powys (from 65 to 120), Essex (from 112 to 204), Durham (from 190 to 299), and North Yorkshire (from 135 to 209). In all, 38 out of 52 forces replied. In England, 17 forces reported an increase and nine a fall. In Wales two forces showed a rise. In Scotland two forces showed a rise and five a fall or no change. Northern Ireland forces reported a fall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
