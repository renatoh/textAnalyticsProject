In a letter to the editor of the London Evening Standard, Veronica Wadley, and other media organisations, the law lord said he appreciated news organisations had a \"difficult and responsible\" task to produce stories swiftly following the publication of the report on Wednesday January 28. The Evening Standard, ITN, Sky News, Reuters and the Press Association had written to Lord Hutton to try to persuade him to release copies of the report on an embargoed basis. They told him that as organisations that would be reporting instantly it would be better that they were fully informed before they went to print or on air. Lord Hutton said it was fairer to allow everyone - except those directly involved in the inquiry - access to report at the same time, which is being published on Wednesday January 28. In a letter to Wadley and other editors today he said: \"Weighing the matter, I have decided that there are powerful considerations against giving any news organisation a prior view of the report before publication (no matter what conditions or embargos might be imposed) and that the fairest course is to present the report to everyone (with the exception of the parties, who will see it 24 hours in advance, subject to strict undertakings as to confidentiality) at the same time.\" The Evening Standard, like other papers up and down the country, runs the risk of looking out of touch because of the two and a quarter hour time lag between reporters' deadlines and the arrival of the paper in the shops. The first edition of the Evening Standard goes to print at 7.45am, the second at 9.15am, the third at 12.15pm, the fourth at 2pm and the fifth at 4pm. If Lord Hutton reports at 10.30am, for example, the Standard could not cover the story until the 12.15pm edition, which does not hit London's streets until 2.30pm. Wadley told MediaGuardian.co.uk: \"We have only just got the letter, but clearly he has drawn a line and he is not prepared to move it. It does not help the Evening Standard and it doesn't help broadcasters.\" Broadcasters fear that without the luxury of time to wade through the report, they will be the victims of spin. \"Even if we haven't time to read it, we will still be under enormous pressure to be able to interpret the report pretty quickly. The BBC and Labour, which will have already worked out their line, will be saying 'go straight to paragraph 42 or to page 71'. So it will be instant spin,\" said one political editor. Many editors fear the report will be leaked to a newspaper from the Labour camp, which will be desperate to seize control of the agenda once it becomes available to a wider audience. This morning the ITV political editor, Nick Robinson, made similar pleas to Lord Hutton, who he fears is \"unfamiliar with the ways of Westminster\". He pointed out in an open letter in the Times that the foreign affairs select committee, which had interviewed both Andrew Gilligan and Alastair Campbell, was unable to keep its own report confidential. As one journalist said: \"You don't even need to know the full contents of the report. All you need is a leak saying Blair is in the clear and that's enough for a story for Wednesday morning. Blair is fighting for his political life and his camp will be trying to set the agenda.\" Sky News and ITN are concerned that the BBC, which is one of the \"interested parties\" that will get copies of the report 24 hours in advance, will have an unfair advantage in its news reporting. \"What will the BBC do, for example, if the report is leaked to the Sun or the Guardian? What will Andrew Marr do - resist reporting it and will he be in a position to get a leak from inside putting a BBC counter-spin?,\" said one journalist. Another said: \"I don't think the BBC will leak. But what I'm worried about is the nods and the winks. If you approach an executive who's seen the report, you may be able to guage by their reaction whether the angle of the story you're hearing is right or not.\" Lord Hutton said he aimed to give a clear summary of his report in his televised statement on January 28 in the high court, which he hoped would help media organisations produce accurate reports. \"In that statement, I will be seeking to summarise the report as clearly and as fairly as I can and I intend that this will have a two-fold purpose. \"First, it will assist those in the media who have to make immediate reports and prepare immediate headlines. Secondly, my summary will make it more difficult for any party or other body or person subsequently to 'spin' the contents and the conclusions of the report.\" He also revealed that he had a communication from the Leader of the House of Commons, Peter Hain, that one MP complained that it would be \"wholly inappropriate\" for the press to be informed before Parliament. \"In addition there is the very real difficulty that if a limited number of news organisations were given a prior view, other news organisations would ask for the same privilege for the same or similar reasons and it would be very difficult to draw a fair and valid distinction between various media organisations.\" And he said it would be very difficult for him to issue the report under embargo to selected news organisations experiencing particular deadline pressures. Separately lobby journalists have written to the department of constitutional affairs requesting similar embargoed instructions and at least one high-profile journalist has requested a 6am lock-in to allow the press time to read the report. \"All sorts of people have written in from various media organisations requesting different things - lock-ins, to film Lord Hutton doing his work, interviews - a whole range of things both before yesterday's announcement and since,\" said a spokesman for the inquiry. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
