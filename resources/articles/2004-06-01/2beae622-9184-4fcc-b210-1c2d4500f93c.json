Inaki Saez's side would have to lower their standards considerably and Luiz Felipe Scolari's team raise theirs for the hosts to reach the quarter-finals. Spain hold an awesome historical superiority over their neighbours. The Spaniards are unbeaten in six matches between the sides since 1981 and thrashed Portugal 3-0 the last time the sides met, in a friendly in Guimaraes last September. Portugal could re-write history - but don't bet on it. Instead, the clever market for making money is corners. Spain, who have averaged 9.5 corners per game in the finals so far, look short-priced at 4.75-5.25 corners in the match. Regardless of how the game unfolds, Saez's side will create plenty of pressure near the corner flags. At all-square, their main tactic to sap the tension from the game will be feeding Joaquin and Vicente down the wings. If they fall behind, the two wingers will be used as their main creative sources and, if Spain are in the lead as the final whistle approaches, you can expect to see them run down time by taking the ball towards the corners flags. Portugal are also experts in winning corners but a buy of their spread at 6.25 looks risky because Spain are well capable of shutting the game down. The longer the game is goalless, the more frustrated Portugal will become and, in contrast to the host nation's full-backs, Spain pair Carles Puyol and Raul Bravo are defenders first and foremost, who will relish taking on direct opponents Simao Sabrosa and Luis Figo and stand a good chance of reducing Portugal's corner count. Another option to consider, if you believe there are at least three goals in the game, is a small buy of total shirt numbers. A handful of potential goalscorers who have yet to deliver may find their form now that judgement day has arrived - Raul (7), Torres (9), Pauleta (9), Vicente (14), Deco (20) and Nuno Gomes (21) could net you a profit if you buy total shirt numbers at 25-28 with IG Index. But the safe bet is Spain corners - stick to that market to maintain a healthy lead in your Euro 2004 betting. Recommended bet: 1.5pt buy Spain corners at 5.25 (IG Index) Greece v Russia Can Russia finish with a bang? At first glance, it appears not. Coach Georgi Yartsev is putting up a brave face, but the odds are stacked against Russia gaining anything more than a point. Rooted to the bottom of the group, they have two key players suspended - captain and on-pitch commander Alexei Smertin and goalkeeper Sergei Ovchinnikov. Yartsev will have to create a new-look defence for the third consecutive game - and, given the paucity of options at his disposal, a late reshuffle hardly bodes well. There is reason to suspect, however, that Greece will play a cautious game. Giorgios Karagounis is suspended and another five players are on yellow cards, just one booking away from missing a quarter-final should the team qualify. The Greeks need only to draw to reach the knock-out stages and so Otto Rehhagel's men would be happy to escape unscathed with a point. A share of the honours would also allow Russia to exit with dignity. And the last three meetings between the sides in the past six years have ended in draws. Despite Greece's obvious superiority at the tournament so far there is, believe it or not, little difference in class between the sides on paper. With nothing except pride to play for, Russia may finally show a few glimpses of the clever, effective football that they are capable of producing. Recommended bet: 1pt draw at 9/4 (Premierbet)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
