We\u2019re basically trying to get right for [Euro] 2021, so there\u2019s going to be a lot of changes, different things, different systems, different personnel, and there may not be great performances in that. But ultimately it\u2019s all for one goal and that is to be peaking and performing for 2021.\u201d White has not played for England since the World Cup because of a knee injury. \u201cIt\u2019s been challenging watching but I\u2019ve been speaking to a lot of the girls and I understand from the whole group what we want to achieve,\u201d she said. The 30-year-old, who has 88 caps, credits Neville with developing her game, despite initial scepticism. \u201cAwful, he\u2019s horrible,\u201d she said with a big grin. \u201cNo, he\u2019s a really lovely guy. He understands what it\u2019s like to be a professional footballer, he understands what it\u2019s like to play for an international team and I think that\u2019s been great for us. \u201cThe communication has been there and he kind of tweaked bits of my game that I was a little bit resistant to start with, but I think it\u2019s really helped and I think it showed at the World Cup \u2013 being in the right place at the right time and that type of thing \u2013 so he\u2019s been a great addition to England and we\u2019re proud that he\u2019s our manager.\u201d Asked what Neville tweaked, she said: \u201cHe initially told me to stay in the 18-yard box, which I was quite resistant to because I like to run about a bit and get involved, but essentially staying in the width of the goal is where you\u2019re going to score goals. \u201cIt took a while for me to change my game a little and really understand what he meant by that. Being in the right place at the right time and the timing. At the World Cup I was surrounded by very talented players putting the crosses in, so it\u2019s having the balance of the talented players but also being in the right place at the right time.\u201d She welcomes the criticism the team have faced since the World Cup. \u201cWe want to be recognised, we want that level of attention, we want to be up there, kind of like the men, if you will. But with that comes criticism, so we just need to take it with a pinch of salt and not get too involved and not get too bogged down in it.\u201d Watching the team struggle from the sofa has been tough. \u201cSitting at home watching the games has been quite frustrating but I\u2019m really pleased to be back in the fold.\u201d Now, having returned for Manchester City, White has been switched from a non-playing squad member to being in Neville\u2019s plans, and a Wembley appearance would be emotional. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible thing to know we\u2019re playing at Wembley and to make it even more special we\u2019re playing against Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m super patriotic in terms of being very English and the rivalry between England and Germany is massive and those games are so exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration at the same time, to thank the fans for supporting us at the World Cup, and hopefully the progression of women\u2019s football to grow and to get bigger and bigger. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be crying if I\u2019m walking out, to be honest, because it\u2019s such an amazing occasion. You can\u2019t help but be swept up in that emotion. Even at the World Cup it was emotional before walking out for games. It\u2019s an amazing achievement to be part of a World Cup, to be walking out with people supporting you, and it\u2019s going to be an amazing occasion with lots of family and friends there as well. If you\u2019re not nervous I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
