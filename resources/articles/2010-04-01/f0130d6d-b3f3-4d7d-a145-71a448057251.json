Despite five days far from home and then hours flying through uncertain skies, the first passengers back into Heathrow last night exuded little more than relief and Anglo-Saxon sangfroid. Asked how the flight from Vancouver had been, one of the first passengers into Terminal 5 opted for understatement: \"Long.\" Others chose humour. \"What's been going on?\" asked Iain Swan with a smile. The 57-year-old surgeon from Glasgow, who had been booked on a flight yesterday anyway, was phlegmatic about the whole affair. \"It was just a normal flight,\" he said. \"[But] a lot of people were pleased just to be getting here, especially when we found out we weren't going to be landing at Shannon.\" Richard Bishop, a 42-year-old private equity analyst who was stranded in Vancouver for five days, said: \"We were going to be the first ones to land, so that made us a bit nervous. But the captain knew what he was doing.\" Derek Picot, who works in the hotel business, agreed. \"They were very competent, actually. BA have done a great job. The skies were very clear and we spent a lot of time over Cornwall.\" He added: \"People were delighted when we landed. People weren't cheering in our cabin, but I hope they were in the back.\" What was he most looking forward to now that he was back? \"Putting in my expenses claim.\" Chris Byrne, an oil worker returning from Lagos, said his flight had been \"tranquil\" and not even half full. \"Everyone was very calm, but I heard there was one chap at the back who nearly had a nervous breakdown.\" His priority, he said, was familial rather than commercial. \"I've missed my daughter's birthday,\" he said. Nick Bennett and his son, returning from Vancouver, said the flight had been \"difficult \u2026 it's nice to fly when you know where you're going\". The new arrivals from Los Angeles were also matter-of-fact. \"There was no panic \u2013 it was a relaxed flight,\" said Sarah Young, who was in the US on business. There had, however, been a degree of personal inconvenience. \"It's my birthday today. I'm 34,\" she said. \"I'll be planning my birthday for Thursday now.\" What else? \"I'm looking forward to seeing my family and friends.\" Television TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn Bowen arrived on a BA flight from Mauritius, where he had spent two weeks on holiday with his wife and three daughters. The family were supposed to return on Thursday. \"There was a lot of very unBritish clapping and cheering when the plane actually landed,\" he said. \"We didn't know until about 20 minutes to go that we were actually going to land at Heathrow.\" Alan Osprey, finally back from a skiing trip in Canada with his wife, was tired and relieved. \"We were a bit nervous about getting on the plane because we weren't sure it was safe to fly,\" he said. \"We'd been stranded in Vancouver for five days. The plane was a very calm plane. There were two cheers \u2013 one when they said we were going to Heathrow, and a second one when we touched down.\" If he'd had his way, they would have landed nearer his Glasgow home rather than in the English capital: \"Vancouver is a cheaper place to be stranded than London,\" he said, before dashing off to look for his wife and a hire car. For him and many others, the travelling is far from over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
