Donna Rotunno did not mention the #MeToo movement by name, but her five-hour closing arguments at the New York supreme court frequently alluded to the social reckoning over sexual violence and abuse galvanized by Weinstein\u2019s numerous accusers. Rotunno exhorted jurors to leave thoughts about the \u201cswinging pendulum\u201d of power outside the courtroom, and focus on the individual charges before them. \u201cHave the courage to make the right decision, no matter how unpopular you might be when you get back to work or your home,\u201d she said. By doing so, \u201cyou can show the world that here in New York, here in the United States, we will not allow outside forces to dictate\u201d. At times, Rotunno\u2019s speech sounded more like a rebuttal of #MeToo than it did of the specific counts of rape and sexual assault against her client. She told the jury that prosecutors had created an \u201calternative universe\u201d, ironically like a movie script, in which \u201cwomen are not responsible for the parties they attend, the men they flirt with, the choices they make to further their own careers, the hotel room invitations and the plane tickets they accept\u201d. She went on: \u201cIn this script, the powerful man is the villain, and he\u2019s so powerful and large that no woman would want to sleep with him.\u201d Weinstein, 67, faces up to possible life in prison on two counts of rape dating from 2013, one count that he forced oral sex on a then Project Runway producer, Miriam Haley, in 2006, and two of predatory sexual assault relating to sex crimes against multiple women. The jury of seven men and five women is expected to begin deliberating on its verdict on Tuesday. As he left court for the day, the movie mogul was asked by reporters what he thought of Rotunno\u2019s final statement. \u201cI loved it. I called it the Queen\u2019s speech,\u201d he replied, in a nod to one of his most successful movies, The King\u2019s Speech. In her closing arguments, Rotunno accused New York prosecutors of kowtowing to public pressure around #MeToo and forcing a criminal case in which the rules of evidence were disregarded. She complained especially bitterly that her client had been cast as an overweight monster whose naked photos were shown to the jury just \u201cto shame him\u201d. Rotunno\u2019s summing up will be followed on Friday with closing arguments for the prosecution. Then the jury will be presented with a very different characterisation of the once-powerful titan of Hollywood as a brutal serial sex offender. Most of Rotunno\u2019s speech was devoted to discrediting the two key accusers in the case \u2013 Haley and the alleged rape victim. The latter is an aspiring actor who the Guardian has not named because of lack of clarity over her desire to be identified. The alleged rape victim was depicted in defense closing arguments as a duplicitous individual who maintained a consensual relationship with the movie mogul over many years but repeatedly lied about it, only deciding to come out with her accusations of violent assault after he had been exposed by the press in 2017 and she could see an opportunity to make money. Rotunno read out an email from February 2018 in which the woman talked about wanting to \u201cpursue damages civilly\u201d against Weinstein, remarking that she did not have \u201cmuch time\u201d if she were to bring a case in New York given the statute of limitations. In total, four of the six accusers who testified against Weinstein had taken on civil lawyers, implying they wanted to sue him once the trial was over, she said. The unnamed accuser told the court earlier this month that she had twice been raped by the film producer, once in a hotel room in the Doubletree Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in March 2013 and again in the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills the following year. Over nine hours of cross-examination over two days, Rotunno was so aggressive in her investigation that she reduced the woman to a panic attack involving uncontrollable sobbing. Rotunno walked the jury through a long series of communications between the accuser and her alleged assailant beginning in 2013 and ending in 2018. \u201cMiss you big guy,\u201d the witness wrote six months after the first alleged rape; \u201cthank you for your unfailing support and kindness that helped me believe in myself,\u201d she said to him two months later. \u201cNot words you say to your rapist,\u201d Rotunno told the jury. The defense summary underlined the uphill job facing the prosecution in its attempt to secure a guilty verdict on all five counts. It is exceptionally rare for US prosecutors to go ahead at trial in cases where female accusers have maintained close and at times sexual relations with their alleged attackers years after incidents. Rotunno deployed the same tactics of character assassination against Haley, who alleges that Weinstein forced oral sex on her at his New York apartment in July 2006. The attorney suggested that the witness was \u201clying about the nature of the interaction\u201d which was entirely consensual. Rotunno dedicated the remainder of her summary to a similar take-down of the testimony of the four other women who provided supporting evidence, though their allegations are not directly being prosecuted. They are the Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra who alleges she was raped by the defendant in her Manhattan apartment in 1993-4; Dawn Dunning who recounted that he propositioned her for a threesome in 2004; Tarale Wulff who alleged she was raped in his apartment in 2005; and Lauren Young who claimed he groped her in a Beverly Hills hotel bathroom in 2013. As she wound up, the lawyer appealed to the jury to distinguish between sex addiction \u2013 an affliction that one of Weinstein\u2019s friends told the court he suffered from \u2013 and rape. \u201cTiger Woods is a sex addict, you don\u2019t see him in a courtroom. Being a sex addict and being a rapist are two different things,\u201d she said. In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at Rainn.org.
