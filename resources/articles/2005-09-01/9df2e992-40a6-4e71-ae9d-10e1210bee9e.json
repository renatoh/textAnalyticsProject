The Ofcom study found that 41% of respondents thought there was too much general election coverage on UK TV in April and May - despite the fact that broadcasters cut down on the airtime they devoted to the campaign, compared to the 2001 election. However, a majority of those polled for the survey - 52% - still thought TV news broadcasters had got the amount of coverage about right. There is further satisfaction for broadcasters in today's Ofcom study, with viewers expressing less dissatisfaction with various aspects of their general election coverage, compared to 2001. This will be seen as some vindication for broadcasters, who overhauled their coverage after the widespread voter apathy with the 2001 election. This year there was less slavish, wall-to-wall TV coverage of daily press conferences and public appearances by politicians - although this was in part because the Labour party, in particular, sought to restrict the national media's access to its top figures. Instead, broadcasters sought to be more innovative in their coverage, with Newsnight sending Michael Crick off around the country in a helicopter and Sky News dispatching Kay Burley to cover the campaign in the marginal Lancashire constituency of Rossendale and Darwen. After the 2001 election, 40% of viewers polled said they switched channels to avoid coverage of the campaign - this year that figure has fallen to 25%. Four years ago 65% said there was too much TV coverage of opinion poll results, while after this year's election the equivalent statistic is 38%. In 2001, a majority of viewers also thought TV provided too much election coverage of personalities, press conferences, walkabouts and other appearances by politicians. In addition, 61% wanted to see less election analysis by political correspondents, and 58% thought there was too much analysis of the campaign by TV pundits. This year, the proportion of viewers believing there was too much of all these elements of TV election coverage has fallen considerably, while the percentage of respondents who thought broadcasters had got it about right has risen appreciably. In terms of the amount of analysis by political correspondents, 54% thought broadcasters got it about right for the 2005 election, with only 29% complaining that there was too much. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
