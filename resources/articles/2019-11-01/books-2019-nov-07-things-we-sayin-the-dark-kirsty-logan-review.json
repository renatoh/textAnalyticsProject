Its three sections, \u201cThe House\u201d, \u201cThe Child\u201d and \u201cThe Past\u201d, focus on fears with particular resonance for women: unnatural children, lurking predators, inadequacy as a mother, and threats both within and without the home \u2013 and indeed the body. In between the stories are what purport to be authorial notes; the book is being composed in Iceland at a writing retreat where, we are told, \u201cI decided I was ready to write about my fears.\u201d Quickly, though, this construct is revealed as yet another fiction, with the \u201cauthor\u201d confessing to her own creeping terrors and sense of alienation. Her wife is not a fan of the project: \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like horror. She tried to listen. But she stopped me before the end of the first story.\u201d In \u201cMy House Is Out Where the Lights End\u201d, one of the more straightforward chillers, nature exudes a patriarchal menace. A young woman returns to the house of her dead father: \u201cBig Pop, terror of the town, half the teeth smacked out of his head.\u201d The building is surrounded by the sunflowers only Big Pop could get to grow so far north, \u201ctheir heavy heads like hoods on drooping necks, their leaves twitching like hands\u201d. But Big Pop\u2019s secret isn\u2019t just green fingers. \u201cThings My Wife and I Found Hidden in Our House\u201d mixes the contemporary and folkloric as a couple unwittingly summon up a kelpie. Stories can be brief and impressionistic, leaving the reader with a nagging lack of closure; in \u201cHalf Sick of Shadows\u201d, apparently caring parents find an apt way to rid themselves of a small child, for reasons unknown. The narrator of \u201cThe Only Thing I Can\u2019t Tell You Is Why\u201d believes her new baby is dead, even as he gurgles and burps. He grows up, \u201cand he goes and gets a job and a wife and a house\u201d, but his mother still \u201cknows\u201d her son is really dead. We\u2019re left to wonder why; is she repelled by his maleness, perhaps? The author in the framing device grows increasingly introspective and gloomy as the book progresses. The final story, the grimmest of all, sets male oppression against female compliance, with an ending balancing hope and despair on a knife edge. There are strong individual stories here, but the book also works cumulatively, building up an impressive atmosphere of dread. \u2022 Things We Say in the Dark is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a312.99).
