For those to whom chucking litres of clean drinking water down the toilet on each flush seems wildly at odds with attempts to protect the environment and slow the climate emergency, compost toilets are increasingly making sense. The idea is simple: treat human waste just as other organic matter \u2013 in a not dissimilar way to how kitchen waste is composted. At his home in France, Daren Howarth, who runs Groundhouse, which supports people building sustainable properties, has a composting loo. The liquid waste is diverted out of his house, filtered through a reed bed and into a pond \u2013 and is then used to water his veg patch. The solids are composted. For his household of four, he empties the bucket every couple of weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. If you\u2019ve got a garden, there is no reason you can\u2019t have a dry toilet system. You\u2019re going to save on your water bill, and [have] all the downstream benefits \u2013 you\u2019re not creating polluted water that has to be treated.\u201d We are the only animal, he says, that deliberately mixes water with our own waste. That\u2019s important, he says, because \u201cyou create such a treatment issue, to clean that water up. It\u2019s ecological insanity.\u201d The anecdotal signs are that people are increasingly open to the idea of composting loos. The Glastonbury festival started embracing them more widely in 2014, and last year it had more than 1,000. \u201cThere is a tub of sawdust out the front with scoops in,\u201d says Jane Healy, the festival\u2019s sanitation manager. \u201cIf you\u2019re just going for a wee you don\u2019t need to take one. If you\u2019re going for a No 2, you take a scoop with you and sprinkle [the sawdust on afterwards].\u201d Most Glastonbury-goers were nonplussed about the toilets \u2013 if anything, they are probably the cleanest and most pleasant loos to use on-site. \u201cAt festivals, people tend to get used to not being in their usual comfort zone when it comes to going to the toilet.\u201d The waste is collected and composted at a local farm. It\u2019s then distributed to other farms, including back to Glastonbury\u2019s Worthy Farm. \u201cThe word waste doesn\u2019t exist in nature,\u201d says Fin Jord\u00e3o, a biologist and compost toilet expert from the Centre for Alternative Technology in Powys, Wales, who has been one of the UK\u2019s leading champions of the idea. \u201cWaste is not a word fit for the 21st century and the ecological society we\u2019re trying to build.\u201d When Jord\u00e3o (who uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d) planted 70 trees on land around their house this autumn, they were fertilised with \u201chumanure\u201d from a compost loo. The liquid waste from the toilet and wash basin is piped to a reed bed, where it fertilises plants, such as comfrey, iris and marsh marigold. The solids, which are sprinkled with carbon-based material, such as sawdust or wood ash, cat litter or coconut coir, are collected in a bucket and emptied every few weeks on to a compost heap. Doesn\u2019t it smell awful? No, says Jord\u00e3o, \u201cIt smells like humus, like the forest floor. It\u2019s that fungus, leafy smell.\u201d Improved sanitation has saved millions of people from the threat of cholera, dysentery and numerous other diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that 2 billion people don\u2019t have access to toilets or latrines, and more than 430,000 people die each year from diarrhoea caused by poor sanitation. Millions more die or suffer from other diseases and conditions, including intestinal worm infections and diseases that cause blindness. Clean, safe water treatment cannot be taken for granted. But the environmental cost is growing. In the UK, flushing the loo accounts for nearly a third of household water consumption. We use drinking-quality water in our toilets, and spend energy and resources on cleaning it afterwards. Water treatment is responsible for about 1% of UK greenhouse gases. A recent article on the scholarly current affairs site JSTOR Daily described how before the development of an efficient sewer network in Europe, the streets overflowed with disease-ridden filth, because nobody could see the value in human compost. Europe\u2019s arable land was rich and fertile. In Japan, by contrast, where land was less fertile, humanure or \u201cnight soil\u201d was so highly valued that when the price soared disputes broke out over who had the right to collect it. In Osaka, writes Lina Zeldovich, where boats came to the city to collect night soil, \u201clandlords had the rights to their tenants\u2019 solid waste.\u201d Some desperate farmers resorted to stealing human faeces. Our agricultural soils are depleted and reliant on artificial fertiliser, so \u201cbiosolids\u201d \u2013 as treated human waste has been rebranded \u2013 could become ever more valuable. UK water companies recycle more than 1m tonnes of waste into biosolids for agricultural use. But this is strictly controlled by legislation, owing to fears about contamination from heavy metals (via industrial wastewater) and from pharmaceutical products. \u201cRight now, we flush our human waste into a water-based treatment works and it\u2019s very hard to get all of the nutrients out once we\u2019ve mixed it with this huge volume of waste water,\u201d says Abraham Noe-Hays, research director at the Rich Earth Institute in Brattleboro, Vermont. \u201cIf we can separate human waste at source, we can reclaim the nutrient value as a resource.\u201d Noe-Hays is mostly interested in repurposing urine. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of the fertiliser is.\u201d Urine is particularly rich in phosphorus, a vital component of manufactured fertiliser that is currently mined from phosphate rock, a finite resource, so focusing on liquid waste is a good first step. \u201cUrine is easier to capture and transport, store and treat,\u201d he says. Solid waste needs to be treated over a long period before it can be used. But could a whole city switch to composting toilets? Noe-Hays says urine-harvesting toilets may be possible. He worked on a project in Brattleboro, where \u201cthere are a number of people who have permanently installed urine-diverting toilets. We show up twice a year, collect [the urine] and take it to a central treatment location, where we pasteurise it and distribute it to farmers, who use it primarily to grow hay. People also use it themselves, in their gardens.\u201d In terms of changing people\u2019s attitudes to their toilet waste, urine-diversion \u201cis actually not a very high barrier. We\u2019ve had very positive reactions to it.\u201d Martin Doyle is a sales manager for WooWoo waterless toilets. His main market used to be places where there was no running water or sewage system \u2013 golf courses or allotments, for instance \u2013 but he says demand has increased in the past two years from people who are interested in installing such a loo in their homes for environmental reasons. \u201cFor the first time, building regulations [from 2010] specified that compost toilets could be used in place of flushing toilets. So there are no legal hurdles in not having a flushing toilet,\u201d he says. By not mixing liquid and solid waste together, \u201cthe poo is relatively dry and therefore smells a lot less than people imagine. And the volume is less than people would imagine, too. I totally appreciate that some people are not going to be comfortable [emptying their own buckets], but it\u2019s as simple as you can make it. The contents of the toilet can then be composted at home. In 12 months\u2019 time you have a nutritious compost that you can use in any way that you like.\u201d At the moment, says Jord\u00e3o, composting toilets are \u201cnot appropriate for the majority of people\u201d. But they could be one day. David Taylor, a roundwood timber framer for eco builder Ty Pren, has created three composting toilets for clients. They have all been in outhouses, but he can envisage a day when even urban dwellings could be composting human waste. \u201cHumanure could be collected by [residents in] a block of flats before being carted off and composted, or it could be processed through a methane digester and that energy could be used within the building itself,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cOne of the interesting things about using a composting toilet system is you\u2019re closing that loop. As westerners, we\u2019re eating a varied diet that contains lots of minerals and vitamins, and the majority of that has been taken from the soil. At the moment, we\u2019re putting all that into fresh, clean drinking water, which has gone through a heavily industrialised process. We\u2019re contaminating drinking water, while cutting away that cycle of nutrients going back into the soil, and producing fertile land to grow from.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 December 2019 because an earlier version referred to hummus, when humus was meant."}, "isHosted": false}}}
