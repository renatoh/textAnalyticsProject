When the Weimar Republic foreign minister Gustav Stresemann died in 1929, his secretary edited 300 boxes of papers down into three volumes. However, as Carr showed, the published version focused overwhelmingly on Stresemann's successes, leaving little room for the subject that, as the raw papers show, occupied most of his time: Germany's relations with Russia, in which Stresemann's record was one of total failure. The Stresemann syndrome is at work in Alastair Campbell's diaries, The Blair Years, published yesterday. We already knew that the former Downing Street enforcer's publisher required him to cut the text by three-quarters. We knew that officials demanded extensive cuts on matters of state and that Cherie Blair insisted the references to her children be excised. We knew too that Campbell had voluntarily purged his book of comments about Gordon Brown that could be of use to a political enemy. What we had not realised, though, is how much Campbell would leave out about his media day job. There is plenty about Campbell's embittered relations with the BBC - how could there not be? But an account in which Trevor Kavanagh of the Sun receives a mere four mentions in more than 700 pages and Tom Baldwin of the Times just one is in no sense a true representation of how Campbell spent nine years of sleepless service to the former Labour leader or of the crucial importance of these two reporters in Campbell's kingdom. Occasionally, a vernacular flash of the man that reporters knew and loved-hated is permitted to intrude. \"God, I hate these people,\" Campbell says of the press in June 2000. That rings absolutely true. His verdict on one journalist is tabloid-succinct: \"Twat.\" For the informed reader there is also much to be gleaned from even the heavily edited accounts of events like Brown's incandescent response to Blair's brief embrace of Will Hutton's stakeholder economy ideas in 1996. But no future historian writing an account of Campbell's relations with this newspaper, for instance, would be able to pen a very informed account of that significant subject on the basis of these diaries. There is no reference to Blair and Campbell's memorably acerbic encounter with the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and two of his staff before the 1997 election. Or to the angry and occasionally charming calls from Campbell that peppered journalists' mornings through these years. I cannot decide if the fact that Hugo Young rates no mention in these diaries says more about Campbell or Young. There is, though, a wonderful vignette of Campbell calling Blair in 1996 and discovering the Labour leader penning an indignant response to a Guardian cartoon. \"I said you're doing what? Have you gone mad? ... Tony, I said, please don't write an article in response to a cartoon. People will think you are bonkers.\" And another about a Guardian scoop the same year on party-union links: \"It was one of those sinking moments when the words 'Oh fuck' flashed right across the mind.\" There is also a vivid account of the fear that tough journalism can induce in the governmental gut over the paper's role in the Peter Mandelson loan affair. Campbell's diaries are undeniably a hugely important source on the inner workings of the Blair government. Yet they are not in any way definitive. Even a cursory comparison of these diaries with those of his spin lieutenant Lance Price shows how different their accounts of the same events can be. Like Stresemann's secretary, Campbell has presented the public with an account that is both spun and doctored. martin.kettle@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
