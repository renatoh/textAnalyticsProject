The dreams litter the interview. Bin Laden's interlocutor says that one Saudi cleric had dreamt of 'a great coup' that resulted in the march of hundreds of men towards Afghanistan. Bin Laden talks of the dream that one of his followers had about a soccer game. Not your run-of-the-mill soccer game, no. In this case, the two competing teams are 'us' (bin Laden's al-Qaeda organisation) and the Americans. 'When our team showed up on the playground, its members turned out to be pilots,' bin Laden says. And he lists more: Followers who dreamed of a gigantic building in America and a fellow al-Qaeda operative teaching karate; a devout man dreamed of a huge plane that he was dragging over his shoulder across a desert. There's even a man, bin Laden says, whose wife had seen the exact scenario of 11 September a week earlier in her sleep. So many dreams in such a short time. This sounds like a true nightmare. Dreams have long been important in Islamic cultural and religious history. Surat Yusuf, inspired by the biblical story of Joseph, is Muslim legend. Centuries before Sigmund Freud, Ibn Sirin wrote The Interpretation of Dreams, a bestseller in the Arab world even today. Imam al- Ghazzali, the eleventh-century theologian, said: 'Prophecy is no longer, only a blessed dream remains.' But the dreams of bin Laden's followers are more rooted in a perverted surrealism than the study of Islamic history or tradition. While the surrealists used dreams to enrich reality, the fundamentalists pursue their dreams to abandon it altogether. For bin Laden and company the reality of the modern world is a chaos where soccer, aircraft, skyscrapers, moonlight deserts and pilots converge. They reject it to build a new ontological structure, this time made of bits of modernity and antiquity, nature and artifice; magical realism and a fascination with gadgetry. The video shows us elements of this bizarre new reality: Prophet Muhammad's era, the wars of early Islam, names of Muslim caliphs (Abu Bakr, Uthman and Ali). Even the classical poem recited by bin Laden is full of swords, horses, drums and storms. Reality is a permanent casualty around bin Laden's table. An expert in fundamentalist movements told me about three sheikhs he had recently met in Europe: 'They had no doubt that al-Qaeda is winning the war in Afghanistan; that hundreds of American soldiers have been killed, but that these facts were concealed by the American media.' To question the authenticity of this video is understandable. But no one has the right to justify such nightmarish plots with the arbitrary mumblings of a visionary who has lost touch with reality. \u00b7 Hazem Saghiyeh is a columnist for al-Hayat newspaper.
