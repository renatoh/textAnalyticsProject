The 30-year-old Senegal forward, sold to Turkey\u2019s Trabzonspor for \u00a32.2m by Hull last summer, was close to finalising a move to Wearside on Monday night. N\u2019Doye is set to arrive on a six-month loan with a view to a permanent signing and Allardyce is hoping he can reprise his form on Humberside where he scored five goals in 12 games last season. \u201cI hope Dame can emulate that for us or do even better,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s manager, who is desperate not to follow Hull\u2019s example and end up in the Championship. \u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk. The biggest thing is the quality of the player. If you think he has got that quality to make a difference. The gamble is, can they do it straight away? If they can\u2019t, the games slip by and by the time they get used to it, it is too late.\u201d His instinct is that N\u2019Doye, who joined Hull for \u00a33m from Lokomotiv Moscow a year ago, can adapt quickly. \u201cHaving had that experience last year, when Hull were struggling, and scoring on a regular basis can be very important for him settling in straight away and scoring for us,\u201d said Allardyce, who hopes to further strengthen his squad and could play his new \u00a3750,000 former Bayern Munich reserve defender Jan Kirchhoff at Swansea on Wednesday. He spoke to Steve Bruce about N\u2019Doye and liked what he heard from the Hull manager. \u201cWhat Steve told me helped me make my decision,\u201d he said. \u201cDame is currently a frustrated player who hasn\u2019t hit it off in Turkey and wants to come back to England because they all want to come back, they all want to play in the Premier League. \u201cIf Dame hits the ground running and scores goals like he did last year his goals are going to save us. He offers us more goals. At the moment Jermain Defoe is our only player with a regular scoring record.\u201d N\u2019Doye will not be available to face Swansea because he will need a visa and a work permit before gaining clearance to play. With such formalities regarded as straightforward, Allardyce hopes to be able to include him at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
