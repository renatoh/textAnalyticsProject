Locked at three penalties apiece at half-time and looking far from the well-oiled machine that has beaten everything in its way since Twickenham last autumn, they crossed twice in the second half without ever dousing the French fire and it was no surprise when the Castres full-back Brice Dulin pulled one back to give the scoreline something better representing a game that ended with All Black backs to the wall. New Zealand's first try had an element of luck, Ben Smith's chip, following the centre's break, bouncing kindly for Charles Piutau and unkindly for Yoann Huget, the covering wing wrong-footed for the touch down. However the second did not, the flanker Kieran Read put in by a clever off load from Piutau, with a further overlap on the outside. By then Dan Carter had been replaced in his 99th Test and the arrival of Aaron Cruden as early as the 52nd minute added extra snap to the stuttering backline. There are suggestions that Cruden may wear the fly-half shirt at Twickenham with Carter moving to inside-centre. It would be a brave coach who denied Carter his 100th cap. As for France, they look to have a fly-half in R\u00e9mi Tal\u00e8s who might find continuing favour with coach Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 after making his first start against New Zealand in June. So much has happened to these coaches since the 2011 World Cup when French player-power came within a point of causing a national nervous breakdown in New Zealand, almost all good for Steve Hansen, mostly mediocre for Phillipe Saint-Andr\u00e9. The New Zealander inherited the world champions and has been on the hottest of winning streaks \u2013 28 from 30 games \u2013 while still able to drip feed new blood into the squad. There have even been sabbaticals for some as Hansen seeks to keep his big hitters around for a couple more years until the next World Cup, whereas Saint-Andr\u00e9's selections have often been noted more for the accompanying head scratching, especially over the half backs as he is now into his ninth combinations. As the All Blacks have gone 11 consecutive wins since they tripped up on their last visit to Twickenham, Saint-Andr\u00e9 has acquired a wooden spoon in the Six Nations \u2013 the worst France performance in the professional era \u2013 has only seven wins from 18 outings and after three defeats in New Zealand in June the odds were heavily against France disturbing the All Blacks' perfect year. In fact the video referee was in action before three minutes had elapsed, Carter, back in harness with Ma'a Nonu and finally full-back Israel Dagg almost putting the right-wing Cory Jane over in the corner. And that formed the pattern of the early play; Carter spreading the ball wide, not always successfully, France choosing a more direct route and winning a couple of penalties at the breakdown, the second of which Parra converted before Carter levelled the scores on 11 minutes and then inched the All Blacks ahead when France collapsed a five-metre scrum. However, things were relatively bright for France and the fans and their bands were clearly happy with the early showing, none more than when the full-back Brice Dulin and the flanker Wenceslas Lauret combined down the left, leading to yet another All Black penalty at the breakdown. When France opted for the scrum, then pushed New Zealand backwards the decibels went off the scale. However, for all that noise all France got was another penalty and the scores were level after 23 minutes, even if things were looking up for Les Blues. Carter squeezed over a third penalty a minute later, but France had a head of steam and the new boy Tal\u00e8s was showing plenty of ambition, linking well with Maxime M\u00e9dard before an All Black tackle off the ball brought France some reward. At 29, Tal\u00e8s may be a late arrival on the Test scene, but as the half progressed the Castres fly-half was becoming increasingly adventurous for a man making only his second start, first putting Wesley Fofana in space before setting up Dulin. Again adventure won a penalty, but this time Parra missed a sitter, and a half which France had edged ran out with the sides level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
