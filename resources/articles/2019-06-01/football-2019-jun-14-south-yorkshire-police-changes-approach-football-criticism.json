Some supporters at the match between Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United complained that they had been held in a crush outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles at Hillsborough, and that police officers had indiscriminately hit people caught in the crush with their batons. The change of policy to \u201ca more community style of policing, and engagement with fans\u201d is due to be launched at a meeting of the force\u2019s football policing officers on 5 July, according to an internal email seen by the Guardian. Sent by Paul McCurry, a superintendent in the force\u2019s Sheffield local policing unit command team, the email invites officers to a full day \u201ccontinuous professional development\u201d session, and explains: \u201cThe purpose of this event will be to formally launch a new approach to policing football and other crowded events across South Yorkshire. \u201cThis follows a thematic inspection into football policing and brings together best practice initiatives from other parts of the UK. Our new approach will see us adopt a more community style of policing, and engagement with fans at the heart of what we will deliver.\u201d This is seen by some football policing experts as nationally significant because the deputy chief constable of South Yorkshire police, Mark Roberts, is the national lead officer in the UK Football Policing Unit, an influential part of the Home Office. Several other forces, including neighbouring West Yorkshire police, have for some time been developing a more consultative approach to policing football, which aims to work with supporters and differentiate between offending and boisterous behaviour. The policy, Enable, emphasises consultation with supporter groups, employs trained liaison officers to communicate with supporters on matchdays and aims to encourage a better atmosphere and behaviour by communication and dialogue. Following the \u201csteel derby\u201d, the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation received 1,012 responses to a survey, in which supporters rated South Yorkshire police\u2019s post-match operation as on average 1.9 out of 10. More than 70.7% described police management of the exit from the stadium at the Leppings Lane end, which was allocated to Sheffield United supporters, as very poor. Almost 80% described South Yorkshire police as \u201cworse than average\u201d compared with other forces around the country. In responses published by FSF, supporters described the policing at the Leppings Lane end as \u201catrocious\u201d, \u201cirresponsible\u201d, \u201cintimidating and unapproachable\u201d. One supporter said of police officers: \u201cHad no idea what they were doing. Swinging batons at anyone they pleased.\u201d Another said that officers were \u201chitting people with batons when they tried to move in the crush of people,\u201d and described that as \u201clegalised assault\u201d. One supporter said: \u201cLeppings Lane policing was irresponsible, bottlenecking fans on the road at the same time caused multiple fights and distress to regular fans.\u201d The police match commander, Ch Supt Shaun Morley, issued a statement on the night of the match saying that six people had been arrested after \u201csome minor disorder\u201d and thanking his officers \u201cfor their efforts professionalism and effectiveness in keeping the public safe\u201d. Following the criticisms, however, the force is understood to have asked a senior officer from another force to conduct the \u201cthematic inspection\u201d review, which has resulted in the launch of the new approach. Dr Geoff Pearson, a senior law lecturer at Manchester university and one of the experts developing the Enable initiative, said he welcomed South Yorkshire police relaunching its approach. \u201cIt is overdue and I hope that it will in turn influence the UK Football Policing Unit to develop a more dialogue-based approach to football policing nationally.\u201d In response to an inquiry from the Guardian about the launch of the new approach, a South Yorkshire police spokesperson said that McCurry\u2019s use of the word \u201claunch\u201d was \u201cmisleading.\u201d She said: \u201cThe new approach, as you describe it, is not being launched on 5 July.\u201d In a further clarification, the spokeswoman explained: \u201cPart of the purpose of the 5 July event is to inform everyone there will be a change in approach to large-scale events, including football, and to seek other people\u2019s views and insights.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
