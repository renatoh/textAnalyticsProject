Among numerous other roles, he was the first presenter of Panorama and the antiques programme Going for a Song. For those of us growing up in the 1950s, the voices that brought us our favourite sports left an indelible memory on the ear. Television was in its infancy and it was to the radio voices of Raymond Glendenning for football, John Arlott for cricket, Raymond Baxter for motor racing and Robertson for tennis that one turned at various times of the year. I was one of the lucky few to succeed Robertson in that cramped but perfectly situated commentary position on Wimbledon's centre court, and it was difficult not to feel both privileged and somewhat apprehensive at taking over from a master at one of the more difficult arts in radio commentary. I think I got better over the years, and could probably match Robertson for knowledge of the game, but the ability to keep up with a quick-fire rally between players of the calibre of Rod Laver, John Newcombe or John McEnroe was something that put Robertson at the top of his field. Frequently I cheated by missing out the third, fifth and seventh shot in a 10-stroke rally. My predecessor rarely did. His ability to describe not just a rally but the whole scene before him with all the attention to detail that radio demands made Robertson very easy on the ear, and his fans were legion. One of those he treasured most was Keith Miller, the great Australian cricketer. Robertson was an excellent cricketer himself, and kept wicket for the BBC XI for many years. So he was especially delighted to receive a fan letter from Miller, whom he had never met, during those years that the Australian was spending his summers in England covering cricket for the Daily Express. Those who saw only the outer layer of Robertson's personality might have thought he did not need such an exalted accolade, since he could appear pompous at times and was not slow in letting people know his opinions. His demeanour was that of a pre-second-world-war public schoolboy, with vestiges of a colonial upbringing lurking in the background. What that meant, of course, was that he was not nearly as sure of himself as he appeared to be, and hid an innate shyness with a tendency to snap at ill-judged remarks that challenged his assumptions. His old-world manners led him to be the butt of many jokes among his colleagues, but, generally, he took the ribbing well. It was, in fact, what he described in his book Stop Talking and Give the Score (1987) as \"a terrible inferiority complex about the cleverness of others in my set\" that saw him leave Cambridge after just one term. But there was no doubting his kindly nature. He always wanted to contribute and to help others. This he did in innovative style when he conceived an idea he called Commonwealth Vision \u2013 an attempt to film children and their families in various parts of the Commonwealth so as to shed light on how everyone else lived in an age before mass tourism. With his wife Lisa (Elisabeth Beresford, creator of The Wombles), and a cameraman in tow, Robertson set off into the outback after covering the 1956 Olympic games in Melbourne and produced a film entitled Six Days to Sydney. That was followed soon after with a tour of islands in the West Indies called Come to the Caribbean. Both were shown on BBC children's television and were pioneering attempts at producing a documentary programme. But the enterprise cost Robertson at least \u00a32,000, a fortune in those days, as well as a hint back home that Paul Fox, head of television sport, did not take kindly to one of his top commentators disappearing for weeks. Fox did, however, help Robertson financially by ensuring that the expensive movie camera that he had bought was rented from him until much of the initial cost was paid off. They were the days when everyone in the broadcasting industry was flying by the seat of their pants, feeling their way in a black-and-white world. Robertson's good fortune was that he had fallen into it, almost by chance, and certainly by the most circuitous route. Robertson was born in Dhaka, then in East Bengal and now capital of Bangladesh, where his father worked for Indian Railways. If that sounded a mundane occupation to young Max, he was more taken with stories of his mother's family being directly descended from Flora McDonald, who had rescued Bonnie Prince Charlie. Certainly there was a wanderlust in his soul and, on leaving Haileybury college, Hertfordshire, he fretted at Clare College, Cambridge, for just that one term before consulting a clairvoyant who lived near Kings Road in Chelsea, south-west London. Already he was being drawn to the idea of joining an expedition to prospect for gold in New Guinea, and for the price of five shillings she told him: \"I think you're going to make your living by your voice.\" After finding nothing in New Guinea, Robertson drifted down to Sydney and persuaded the Australian Broadcasting Commission to let him do a set of talks entitled A Pommy in Papua. A career was born. On returning home at the start of the second world war, Robertson applied for a job with the BBC's Empire programmes and was enlisted as a newsreader for the European service that would play such a key role during hostilities. Soon he was a member of that august group, including Frank Phillips, Robert Dougall and Alvar Liddell, who were listened to on pain of death in cellars and lofts all over occupied Europe. His Wimbledon commentaries began with the resumption of the championships in 1946, and three years later he transferred to Outside Broadcasts. By then Robertson had distinguished himself by attempting a running commentary as a \"passenger\" on the British bobsleigh team as they roared down the Cresta run at St Moritz, Switzerland, which held the first postwar Winter Olympics. For once, he found himself travelling faster than he could talk. He followed Princess Elizabeth's tour of Canada in 1951 and was part of the TV commentary team, led by Richard Dimbleby, at her coronation a year later. The decision to become a freelance broadcaster in 1953 proved fortuitous, because the debut of a new programme called Panorama had been catastrophic, with a Fleet Street journalist bumbling his way through a shambolic broadcast. Robertson, now established as a smooth talker who was able to ad-lib, was available, and became the first regular presenter of a programme that started out with a more lighthearted manner than the Panorama of today. There were murmurs, however, that Robertson was too lightweight for the role, and eventually, when Malcolm Muggeridge stepped in while Robertson was engaged in Wimbledon duties, it was decided that he should continue on a permanent basis. It was in 1964, while he was commentating on tennis at Bournemouth, that George Pagan, a member of the BBC's engineering staff at Bristol, suggested that Robertson might like to take part in a new programme about antiques called Going for a Song. As an avid collector, Robertson jumped at the chance and became the face of the programme for 12 years till 1977. When the BBC terminated his contract as Wimbledon commentator in 1986 \u2013 an enforced retirement at the age of 70 which left him sad and resentful \u2013 he took to writing verse, notably The Ballad of Worple Road (1997), about Wimbledon's early years. His first marriage was to an Australian, Nancy Suttor, and they had two sons. His second marriage, to Beresford in 1949, produced a son and a daughter. They were divorced after 35 years when he could no longer stand the isolation of tax exile on Alderney, in the Channel Islands, and moved to Guernsey. \u2022 Max (William Maxwell) Robertson, broadcaster, born 28 August 1915; died 20 November 2009"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
