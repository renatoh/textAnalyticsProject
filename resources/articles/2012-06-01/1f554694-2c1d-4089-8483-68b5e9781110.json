We will keep very good memories of the player but also of the man.\" The former England midfielder worked with the new Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, when they were both at Chelsea and the 30-year-old would fit into the quick-passing style of play Rodgers is set to introduce at Anfield. Roy Hodgson brought Cole to Anfield on a free transfer from Chelsea but having failed to impress in his first season he was sent on loan to Lille by the then manager Kenny Dalglish. Dave Whelan has defended his running commentary on Liverpool's search for a new manager after being branded a \"comedian\" by the Anfield club's managing director, Ian Ayre. The Wigan Athletic chairman irked Liverpool during their hunt for a replacement for Dalglish, which ended with last week's appointment of Rodgers. He revealed Liverpool had made an approach for his manager at Wigan, Roberto Mart\u00ednez. He then detailed Liverpool's intentions to dilute the new manager's responsibilities, a plan that was ultimately altered by owners Fenway Sports Group, and caused particular consternation at Anfield with the claim that Mart\u00ednez was offered the job. Following on from criticism of Whelan by the Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard last week, Ayre said: \"Our aim from the outset was to conduct a proper, thorough search, and do it in the proper manner. From our point of view, we did all the right things. We approached the clubs we needed to approach, and conducted ourselves properly at all times. \"It is disappointing, then, that Dave Whelan felt the need to run the kind of sideshow he conducted via Sky Sports News and various other media outlets. To be honest, I always thought John Bishop was the biggest comedian in the north-west, but Dave Whelan seems to have taken that mantle over the last couple of weeks.\" Whelan, however, has stood by his comments, though he refused to be drawn into a war of words with Liverpool. He said: \"I cannot help it if some people misinterpreted what I said, which was that Liverpool wanted our manager - which they did as they asked permission to speak with him, and talked to him on a number of occasions. \"My response [to Ayre] is a simple one: I wish Liverpool all the very best with their new manager. They have appointed a super lad for the job, a very good manager, and I am very happy for them. We've kept Roberto Mart\u00ednez, so I wish them luck for next season.\" Ayre also reiterated that Rodgers was the only man offered the job of Liverpool manager, a point made at the 39-year-old's unveiling at Anfield by chairman Tom Werner. \"We make no secret of the fact we spoke with Roberto Mart\u00ednez but that is all we did. He is a great guy, and I can't speak highly enough of his professionalism and conduct,\" added Liverpool's managing director. \"But for his chairman to make suggestions like he has, and suggestions that just aren't true, well it is disappointing to say the least. We can say with absolute certainty that the only person who was made any offer by Liverpool is Brendan Rodgers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
