Post-9/11 the story of the flag and Ground Zero has taken up at least 30% of my time, and that's not counting all the hours we've spent relocating our offices, which were on the 89th floor of the first tower. The 89th took a direct hit from the plane. I saw it with my own eyes. Like me, my wife, Shirley, who I first met in the WTC in 1975, has been as equally involved in all the legal negotiations regarding the fate of the flag. Even today, we're still dealing with lawyers in drafting an agreement between us and the City of New York, as to how and where the flag should be exhibited. I was born in Greece, on the island of Ithaca, but I am an American citizen and very proud of the flag of the USA. For me and Shirley, the flag is the only good thing about that terrible day. It symbolised all the heroism that we saw; it said, \"America is here, we shall overcome\". That's why we are so concerned about its future because we believe it now belongs to the people of America. What worries me is that it could end up being auctioned into private hands, or even leaving the country. We heard that the New York fire department [NYFD] wanted to purchase it but that would mean future generations of Americans would never see it again. That's when I decided to take legal action to stop that happening. After it was removed from Ground Zero, it travelled to Afghanistan on board the US air carrier Theodore Roosevelt before being returned to New York's city hall. Now City authorities say they want to place it in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC and we have no objection to that as long as we are acknowledged as the rightful owners. A museum would be the perfect place for it because that way it would be safe, would never leave the US and every American would get to see it. It saddened me that the New York Times wrote an article stating that we were trying to establish a claim to the flag for personal gain - although in the end the paper did apologise, in another article, for implying that. I bought the flag a year or so before September 11th in a private boat show for $50. Even though it belongs to me, it is, as I have said, the pride of America now and belongs to the nation. This has been a dreadful year, emotionally, physically and economically. We lost an estimated $1.3m in business. If you don't think about those awful events once every two hours then you catch yourself thinking about them once every two days. I will, even today, make huge detours and walk blocks around Ground Zero to avoid the bad memories. But the flag has brought out all the patriotism in me; it's the one thing that makes me feel good. On August 10 New York City held a big celebration in honour of the firefighting units lost on September 11. We donated the use of our various vessels, including the Star of America, to the NYFD for the big celebration on the Hudson River. I was really honoured when the head of the US coastguard boarded the Star of America to present me and Shirley with another flag from the Capitol in Washington DC. We have now put it on the ship alongside a plaque marking the donation. It is our pride and joy. Helena Smith"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
