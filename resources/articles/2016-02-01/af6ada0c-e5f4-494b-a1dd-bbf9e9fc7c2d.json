Based on the 2009 bestseller attributed to \u201cJane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith\u201d, the film is an elaborate spoof of Pride and Prejudice, taking place in an alternative England where the undead roam the land. The haughty Darcy (Sam Riley) is a renowned zombie hunter and Lizzie (Lily James) a dazzling ninja warrior. You get the elegant badinage, and then you get the people with half-eaten faces getting their bonneted heads blown off. It\u2019s meticulously acted with deadpan attention to form \u2013 as well acted, in fact, as any conventional Austen adaptation \u2013 and it could conceivably be read as a satire of the traditional middlebrow tea-time costume drama (Andrew Davies\u2019 TV version gets a gag to itself). And there is maybe something to be said for re-imagining Austen\u2019s primly ordered world in contrast to an alien, disturbing \u201cOther\u201d (Harriet and Miss Bickerton being menaced by Gypsies in Emma could also be recast as a non-PC satirical zombie incident). But, in the end, there\u2019s something unearned and charmless and pointless about it all. Helen Fielding\u2019s Bridget Jones and Amy Heckerling\u2019s Clueless were laughing with Jane Austen. This seems like it\u2019s just laughing at Austen. It feels like anti-fan-fiction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
