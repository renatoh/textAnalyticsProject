On Sunday, just over a week after the Grand National, Dunwoody will run his first London Marathon. Twice a National winner in 1986 and 1994 on West Tip and Miinnehoma, his sudden change of discipline after his retirement from the saddle has amused his former colleagues. \"They think I'm mad; they think I'm bloody Forrest Gump,\" says the three-times champion jockey. \"But they've got their own jobs to concentrate on at the moment. I'm sure they're not that bothered about me and my running.\" This will be the 38-year-old Ulsterman's second attempt at 26.2 miles after a successful debut in New York last year. Then, on an unusually balmy November day, he hauled himself around the Big Apple in a creditable 3hr 18min. Now, having learned his lessons from that event, he hopes to be considerably quicker. \"I've learned a lot about the dehydration side of running, so I'm hoping it's going to be quite cool in London,\" says the man who has spent half his life wasting in saunas to keep his weight down. \"Because I sweat a lot I get very dehydrated so I have to really combat that. That was the biggest problem in New York. When we turned into Central Park at mile 24 I was really dehydrated and suffering from cramp. I couldn't bend down or even sit down when I crossed the finish line - but I'm still glad I did it. \"This time I just need to be really careful about the pace and not go too quick too early. I just hope I don't get held up at the start.\" It is only 2 years since a persistent neck injury forced Dunwoody to bring the curtain down on a career which boasted 1,699 winners and partnerships with countless great horses, including Desert Orchid. Now plying his trade as a football agent, he's tried his hand at numerous challenging hobbies including motor racing and powerboating. But endurance running, which he took up in the latter stages of his riding career, is the one he is pursuing most vigorously. Despite having immersed himself in what by most people's standards would be an active retirement, he has often admitted that he yearns to return to the saddle. Training for a marathon did not stop him from attempting to pick up a spare ride when the opportunity arose at the recent Cheltenham Festival. \"When Adrian Maguire broke his neck before the festival there was a ride going on Florida Pearl in the Gold Cup,\" he says. \"So I rang up on the Monday to ask if there was any chance of getting a ride. There was a swift response of 'Not a lot'.\" Mention of Maguire's name is a reminder of the epic duel the pair fought for the 1993-94 jockeys' championship, Dunwoody edging it by a mere three winners. It was the stuff of racing legend and also the point at which he reorganised his priorities as a jockey and began his dalliance with running. \"As I was getting a bit older it was more important for me to be as physically fit as I could. Running was part of that,\" he says. \"When I eventually retired I had more time on my hands and so I ran more. I remember the first half-marathon I did. At that stage it was like, 'shit, am I going to be able to run 13 miles?' But I enjoyed that one and it's gone on from there.\" Dunwoody's unwavering dedication to his new hobby inevitably raises comparisons with his obsessive approach to winning races. But he insists that running remains merely a pleasant pastime. \"The thing about running is that you compete against yourself. It's not so much about racing against other people,\" he says. \"But you do have to be disciplined, a bit like a jockey. Sometimes it's not easy to go and do a 15-mile training run if it's a wet day. But you have to do it. \"It's the same as having to drag yourself off to Sedgefield. Training for these events does take a lot of time and the body takes plenty of punishment. So it's really a case of finding the happy medium where training doesn't take over. It's a hobby; it's nice to keep improving but you have to be realistic.\" Yet it is clear Dunwoody's competitive spirit still burns brightly and he jokes that he'll give one of his marathon partners, the former jockey Gee Armytage (best time 3:17), a run for her money in the capital. And, just maybe, as he passes the pantomime horses on his way towards the Mall, his thoughts might take a surreal leap back to Aintree and battling round the torturous Elbow to victory on West Tip and Miinnehoma. \u00b7 Richard Dunwoody is running the London Marathon to raise money for the children's sporting charity Sparks \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
