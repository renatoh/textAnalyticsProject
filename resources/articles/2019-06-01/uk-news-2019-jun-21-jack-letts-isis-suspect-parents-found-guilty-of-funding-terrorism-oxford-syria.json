John Letts, 58, an internationally renowned organic grain farmer, and Sally Lane, 57, a former Oxfam fundraiser, defied police warnings and sent \u00a3223 to Jack Letts, now 23, despite concerns he had joined Isis. They knew they were breaking the law, the Old Bailey jury was told. In one message, Lane told her son: \u201cI would go to prison for you if I thought it gave you a better chance of actually reaching your 25th birthday.\u201d The couple refused to believe that Jack, a Muslim convert, had become an extremist, and sent the money because they believed he was in mortal danger. The prosecution argued that the couple \u201cdid not want to hear the truth\u201d and \u201cturned a blind eye to the obvious\u201d. The judge Nicholas Hilliard QC sentenced the couple to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. He said that in their love for their son they had lost \u201csight of realities\u201d even though \u201cthe warning signs were there\u201d. The jury was not told that Jack was believed to be in the custody of Kurdish authorities, accused of being a member of Isis. In an ITV interview from prison in February, Jack, who has dual UK and Canadian citizenship, said he doubted officials from either country would help him because \u201cno one really cares\u201d. In a statement outside court, the couple said: \u201cWe have been convicted for doing what any parents would do if their child was in danger.\u201d There was no suggestion during the trial that the money they sent was used for terrorism, they said, adding that they felt badly let down by the police and the government. They said they had pleaded with the government to help get Jack back to the UK. \u201cHaving escaped from Isis, he is in limbo,\u201d they said. \u201cThe heavy price we paid today is an indicator of the love we have for our children. We are committed to help Jack return home.\u201d His parents initially sent him \u00a3223 in September 2015. They then attempted to send another \u00a31,000 in December, claiming Jack, who has obsessive compulsive disorder, was trapped in Raqqa and needed the money to escape. Those transfers were blocked. The jury deliberated for almost 20 hours before finding them guilty of the September charge but not guilty of the December charge. They could not reach a verdict on a third charge, which will remain on file. Jack converted to Islam aged 16 and travelled to Syria in 2014, when he was 18. The couple paid for his return flight to Jordan in May 2014, believing he was on a \u201cgrand adventure\u201d learning Arabic, despite one of Jack\u2019s friends warning them about his growing extremism. Jack then moved to Kuwait and married in Iraq, before he rang his mother to say he was in Syria in September 2014. Wanting to help Jack was not a defence, the prosecutor Alison Morgan QC told the jury. \u201cOnce Jack Letts made the decision that he did to follow Islamic State to Syria and live in Islamic State territory, and to defend its ideals and goals, the normal parenting rules for what you can do to help your child change.\u201d Jurors heard that Jack said \u201cthe most appalling things\u201d on social media and in messages to his parents. In one Facebook comment, underneath a photograph posted by a former schoolfriend with young British army comrades, he wrote that he would like to \u201cperform a martyrdom operation in this scene\u201d. He said he wanted to behead the same schoolfriend, and warned British police who had raided his parents\u2019 home to \u201cdie in your rage soon you\u2019ll be the one being raided\u201d. His mother, in evidence, denied her son posed a danger, dismissing his comments as \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d. The couple claimed Jack was in immediate mortal danger because he wanted to leave and the money was to get him out of Syria. \u201cThat was the price we had to pay, and if that was the price we had to pay then we were going to do it,\u201d Lane told the court. His parents have made repeated attempts to get the UK and the Canadian governments to help get Jack out of Syria, including organising protests and staging hunger strikes to draw attention to their case. DCS Kath Barnes said investigators had \u201chuge empathy\u201d with the couple but it was not for them to choose when it was \u201cOK to break the law\u201d. Jenny Hopkins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was natural for parents to care for their son, but the couple had been warned \u201cmultiple times\u201d. \u201cThey chose to ignore that advice and at one point set up a fake identity to send him money,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to change text in the first paragraph that did not conform to the Guardian\u2019s style guidelines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
