The scenery was stunning and I did not mind that we were inching along the N2, until the reason why became horribly apparent. On a grassy verge in the middle of the motorway lay two overturned vehicles surrounded by emergency crews, and white sheets were being draped over three corpses pulled from the wreckage. Police had reduced traffic to a single lane at the scene, where a crowd of onlookers gazed in silence. There was no mention of the accident on the radio, nor in the following day's local papers. Why should there have been? It was only three dead. They were not celebrities and there was nothing spectacular about the collision. In terms of news, it was a non-event. Except in a statistical sense. Those three lives helped to nudge the road accident death toll for the holiday season to more than 1,000. A solid, round number which has alarmed South Africa. The carnage on the roads is an appalling, bloody, daily reality. From a population of 40 million, more than 9,000 people are killed annually, one of the highest per capita rates in the world. During the December break, when those not swapping cities for the beach tend to return home, the roads are busy and especially lethal. At least 1,016 have died in the past four weeks and that rate is expected to continue in January as people return to work. It as if several jumbo jets were crashing each month. Usually the accidents are shrugged off as a tragic but ineluctable consequence of society's need for vehicles and speed but the recent mayhem has jolted the authorities. \"Our safety record is really bad,\" Ntau Letebele, the head of government road safety projects, told the Associated Press. \"But while many people get angry about the Aids issue and environmental issues, we have not seen people taking a collective stand to rise and march against road accidents.\" Shortly before making these comments Mr Letebele had been forced to swerve off a highway north of Johannesburg to avoid a head-on collision with a minibus taxi van which had overtaken three other vehicles. \"I had to get off the road in order to save my life,\" he said. Why South Africa's roads are so dangerous is a controversial question. The department of transport blames badly trained traffic officers who punish speeding but not drunkenness, bad driving or unroadworthy vehicles. Drive Alive, a non-profit organisation founded in 1989 by Moira Winslow after her son, daughter and two grandchildren were killed in a car accident, says traffic police often take bribes instead of issuing tickets. In a country where many people are not trained to drive and have no licence, where brakes on 30-year-old vehicles are held together with string and mirrors are cracked, there is little fear of being caught or punished. A total of 364 foreign tourists and visitors were killed on South African roads in eight provinces in the 12 months leading up to March 31 2002. Some died when their coaches skidded and overturned, others in rented cars. Another cause is alcohol, with 60% of accidents said to be booze-related. There is not the same stigma of drink driving as in Europe and it is not unusual to see dinner parties ending with guests weaving to their cars. It doesn't help that many pedestrians are also drunk and walk along or across unlit roads. So many have been killed that officials have issued a new warning: don't drink and walk. A common culprit is the minibus taxi. Often a jalopy designed to carry light goods, it can be packed with more than 20 people without seat belts and driven by a maniac, or at least a man in a rush. When it crashes the dead are often in double digits. My own theory is that fatalism causes some of the deaths. \"If your time is up it makes no difference if you buckle up,\" a Johannesburg taxi driver told me once, grinning as he overtook a lorry and I gripped the dashboard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
