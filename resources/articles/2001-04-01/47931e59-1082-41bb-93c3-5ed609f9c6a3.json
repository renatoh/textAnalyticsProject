Fortunately, no one has mentioned this to the Stereo MC's. They ambled on stage as that group who did the song from the mobile phones ad, the 52nd best band ever (according to Q magazine) and keepers of a flame most people thought went out when Noel Gallagher was still working for British Gas. By the time they ambled off, they were heroes. Pasty singer Rob Birch exuded a dilapidated charisma, doing a remarkable job of not being upstaged by the irrepressible Cath Coffey and the rest of the female front line. Nick Hallam stayed behind his keyboards, as faceless and hunched as a techno boffin, while drummer Owen If and percussionist Kwaku Dzidzornu laid down the sort of pummelling rhythmical bedrock many drum machine-laden dance acts can only dream about. The band sounded exactly the same as it always did. The MC's are masters of melodious swagger, producing finely chiselled, diamond-hard anthems that are effortlessly streetwise and yet curiously melancholy. Put simply, for all the seamless blending of hip-hop, funk, soul and rock'n'roll, and the goosebump-inducing vocal harmonies, this is just a fantastic pop group with fantastic pop songs. The newer tracks from the Deep Down and Dirty album were slightly anonymous, but that was perhaps inevitable, given the spine-tingling familiarity of the oldies. When the sound engineer applied the Connected vocal effect to Birch's voice during his introduction to that song, a tremor of anticipation shuddered through the auditorium. As the group blasted into the opening groove, the crowd went wild, energised by the sort of emotional escapism that ageing ex-Hacienda veterans remember with a tear. The performance was so infused with energy, the overall sound so sharp and contemporary, that it was impossible to accuse the band of coasting on nostalgia. They are clearly champing at the bit, and ready, one hopes, to stick around and be brilliant for a long while to come. Anyone looking for the greatest band in the world can stop right here - the Stereo MC's have moved from number 52 to number one overnight. \u0095 Stereo MC's are at Fabric, London EC1 (020-7336 8898), tonight."}, "isHosted": false}}}
