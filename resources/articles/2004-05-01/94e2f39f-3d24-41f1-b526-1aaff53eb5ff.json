With 64 seconds left Montferrand, nursing a six-point lead by playing out time, worked possession at a ruck five yards from the Quins line, but the world's most capped player flopped his 18st frame on the wrong side and stopped the ball emerging. The action so incensed the Montferrand centre Rapha\u00ebl Chanal, who had been back on the field only seven minutes after a sin-bin stint, that he twice punched the prop's face smack in front of Hugh Watkins, the touch judge. A second yellow means red and Quins made the most of their reprieve by launching one final attack. From it they fashioned their best move of the match, George Harder and Ugo Monye creating space for Simon Keogh to split the defence and touch down under the posts, leaving Andy Dunne to kick the winning conversion. Chanal's failure to channel his frustration turned victory into defeat and summed up Montferrand's day. Patently the more proficient side, they allowed Quins to stay in touch by acts of rank indiscipline and lack of concentration at crucial times, failings which allowed Leonard to cap his remarkable career on a high. \"The sending off was out of character with the game, which was played in a good nature,\" said Leonard. \"We showed that when you have a team spirit like ours you can overcome anything. \"I am not sure what the future holds but I hope to remain involved in the game.\" By winning, Quins now qualify for next season's Heineken Cup and ensured Leicester will play in Saturday's wild-card final. But the Londoners need to beef up their front five if they are to make an impact in Europe. There were periods in the second half here in Reading when Montferrand seemed to be in permanent possession. The lead changed hands six times, with neither side ever more than a score ahead, but Montferrand should have imposed themselves from the outset when the fly-half G\u00e9rald Merceron, who by his actions seemed intent on explaining why the French club had signed the Wales No10 Stephen Jones, ignored a two-man overlap and was enveloped by a grateful defence. \"It sums up our season,\" said the Montferrand captain Tony Marsh. \"We have lacked discipline at crucial times. A big problem for us is that referees in France let players get away with far more than officials in Britain do.\" Harlequins kept the trophy in England for the fourth consecutive season but the disappointing crowd of little more than 13,000, one-quarter of that which watched the Powergen Cup final at Twickenham two months ago, indicates that the Parker Pen Challenge Cup is not indelibly inked on the minds of supporters. That is a pity because from the quarter-finals onwards it matches the competitiveness of its big brother and is a more meaningful route for Heineken Cup entry than wretched wild-card play-offs which reward losers. Quins became the first team to win the trophy twice. \"We have made a habit of finishing games strongly,\" said Quins' director of rugby Mark Evans, who introduced Leonard, still troubled by a foot injury, in the 78th minute. Montferrand held all the aces until the prop's flop, proof that nothing counts more than experience.
