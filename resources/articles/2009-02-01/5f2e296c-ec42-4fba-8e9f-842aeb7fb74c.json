David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that the British and US governments had agreed his return \"as soon as the practical arrangements can be made\". Mohamed, expected to arrive in the UK on Monday and described recently by his US lawyer as \"all skin and bones\", ended his hunger strike last week as British officials visited him at the US camp in Cuba. A medical assessment undertaken by a British doctor showed him to be fit to return, Miliband said. The foreign secretary said the government had asked the US to release and return all \"former legal UK residents\" detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in August 2007. That request was made after \"full consideration to the need to maintain national security and the government's overriding responsibilities in this regard\". But he said the return of the Ethiopian-born 31-year-old \"does not constitute a commitment by the home secretary that he may remain permanently in the UK\". His immigration status would be reviewed following his return, Miliband said. Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 as he tried to fly back to London. He was subsequently secretly flown by the CIA to Morocco, where he says he was tortured. He was later flown to Afghanistan before being renditioned to Guant\u00e1namo. The high court has heard evidence that an MI5 officer interrogated him when he was being held incommunicado in Pakistan. MI5 later agreed to give the CIA information about Mohamed even though the CIA refused to say where he was being held and in what conditions. Mohamed was accused by the US of conspiring to make a \"dirty bomb\", but he says his confessions were made under torture and the US dropped all charges against him last year. Confidential evidence about the role of British security and intelligence officers in the case is with Lady Scotland, the attorney general, and Mohamed's lawyers are fighting Miliband's refusal to disclose US documents which high court judges say contain \"powerful evidence\" relating to their client's ill treatment and British government knowledge of it. Clive Stafford Smith, director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has represented Mohamed, described news of his impending release as \"truly wonderful news\". He said Mohamed wanted \"nothing more to return to normal life in Britain\". He also thanked the Foreign Office for working \"long and hard to secure Binyam's release\". William Hague, shadow foreign secretary, tonight stepped up pressure on Miliband, saying a summary of the secret evidence about Mohamed's treatment and who knew about it must now be released. \"The serious questions about the British government's role in Binyam Mohamed's detention will not simply go away,\" he said. Edward Davey, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: \"With Mr Mohamed back in the UK, the government will have to come clean over any British role in his alleged rendition and torture. \"The attorney general has a huge responsibility on her shoulders ... Britain's international reputation is on the line.\" Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International, said: \"We also need a proper independent inquiry into Binyam's case and allegations of a cover-up over torture, as well as into the wider practice of rendition and secret detention. \"The UK government should also now press for the release of Shaker Aamer and Ahmed Belbacha - two other men with longstanding links to the UK \". Yvonne Bradley, Mohamed's US military lawyer, said: \"I've repeatedly requested a full mental health evaluation from the camp authorities for Binyam, but they've flatly refused. It's now time for Binyam to get expert healthcare in aiding his full recovery from what has been an unbelievable personal ordeal for him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
