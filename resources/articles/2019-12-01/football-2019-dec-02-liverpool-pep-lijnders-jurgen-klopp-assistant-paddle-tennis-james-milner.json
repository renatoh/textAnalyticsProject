It comes back in every drill\u2019", "bodyText": "Long before Liverpool reached last season\u2019s Champions League final, preparations for a possible showdown in Madrid were being made by Pepijn \u201cPep\u201d Lijnders. The semi-final against Barcelona had not been played but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s assistant was already contemplating the ideal preparation. He thought about inviting a team who could mimic Ajax\u2019s or Tottenham\u2019s style, to give Liverpool an idea of what they could expect if they overcame Bar\u00e7a. The location was decided. Marbella\u2019s weather was similar to Madrid\u2019s and it would be relatively easy to fly a team there secretly. \u201cI really wanted to organise a game because otherwise it would have been three weeks without any competitive action,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cI wanted us to play a similar team to the opponents we could face in Madrid. The idea was to privately invite a team to train three to four days in the way we wanted them to play us in the friendly.\u201d Lijnders\u2019 efforts proved well worth it after Liverpool overcame a 3-0 deficit to reach the final. \u201cBenfica B came over and everything remained secret,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cWe gave a presentation to their manager about how they had to play. It had to be like Tottenham, with their set pieces, footballing intentions and defensive organisation. We played that game behind closed doors. We even built higher shields so no one could see anything. The match took place exactly one week before the final and we prepared everything like we would do during the day of the final.\u201d Liverpool, who defeated Benfica B 3-0, secured the Champions League by beating Spurs 2-0. When watching the buildup to the early goals in both those games there is a recognisable pattern, with Liverpool winning possession on the halfway line and playing a long ball to Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cIn both moments you could clearly see how we positioned ourselves to be able to dominate the second-ball game and directly searched for Sadio into the free space behind the last line.\u201d Lijnders is speaking at the Melwood training ground. Dressed in a club jumper featuring six stars symbolising the European Cup victories he explains how the technical staff work on a daily basis. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen [Klopp] is the leader and face of the team, the one who defines the character and who stimulates everyone. Pete [Peter Krawietz] is responsible for the analysis and prepares everything in regards to videos which are shown to the players. I\u2019m responsible for the training process. \u201cTogether we decide what kind of aspects we want to develop for the team and then I create the exercises. It\u2019s quite simple; it\u2019s just about the continuing stimulation of our mentality to conquer the ball as quick and as high up the pitch as possible. That element comes back in every exercise. We as staff always try to find ways so the players can be more spontaneous and more creative.\u201d The high counterpressing has become the identity of the modern Liverpool. Lijnders works to refine its model and creates exercises which help players master the system. For example, in training a rule can be that a goal counts only when all the players have crossed the halfway line. \u201cPurely to stimulate the team to push up quickly and be ready to counterpress; counterpressing is only possible when you are together at all times. People say Liverpool are good at this or at that but I always say the main thing we are good at is that we are always together.\u201d Lijnders explains there are a lot of formats. \u201cLet\u2019s take the five-v-two rondo, which in fact is a pressing rondo. Our game is about movement and speed, and with only five players those five have to run non-stop. The two guys in the middle are encouraged to make an interception within the first six passes. If they succeed, they can go out both at the same time, otherwise only the player who intervened is allowed to leave the middle. This all stimulates our counterpressing vision where we try to disrupt the buildup of the opponent inside their first few touches.\u201d Lijnders explains how they often continue a session with other rondo-esque exercises, such as two teams of three competing against one team of three, until the latter wins the ball and replaces the team who lost the ball. That exercise is about instant transition and not dwelling on disappointment after losing possession. Lijnders argues those drills help shape Liverpool\u2019s identity. \u201cThe players first have to understand the importance of counterpressing to our team. They have to feel it, not with the head, but with the heart. They start the exercise with the idea to keep the ball, but in the event of losing it they have to be directly on top of things. \u201cWhen a team lose the ball in training, you will hear me, J\u00fcrgen or Pete screaming: \u2018Go! Get it back! Don\u2019t stop!\u2019 It\u2019s so loud they\u2019ll even hear that in Manchester, haha. They have to understand why it\u2019s so important. That power and emotion is our game. Because our identity is intensity. That comes back in every drill. And that\u2019s what I like about coaching: that you can stimulate certain common behaviour and create a lot by specific team training. That\u2019s what I live for.\u201d Lijnders is only 36 but has been coaching for years. At 17 he was forced to quit playing after sustaining a serious knee injury. He quickly moved into coaching and after starting at the amateur side SVEB in the Netherlands he moved to PSV as a youth coach. In 2007 he went to Porto to become their academy\u2019s head of individual development and coached the youth team. After a few seasons Manchester United were keen to take him but that failed to materialise when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and Lijnders joined Liverpool in 2014, with responsibility for the Under-15s and Under-16s. A year later he was promoted to the first team by Brendan Rodgers. Lijnders says he is often inspired by the players when creating exercises. \u201cThe five-v-two rondo is a good example. It\u2019s actually called Milly\u2019s rondo now, after I got inspired by James Milner, because he always intercepted the ball within the first few passes. He was really quick and brought the focus of the rondo to another level. I was like: \u2018How can I come up with a rule that everyone will execute with his kind of intensity?\u2019 So I gave an extra incentive for the two players in the middle if they would intervene within the first six passes. So I told Milly: \u2018This is your idea!\u2019 The other players loved it.\u201d Lijnders strongly believes in the power of role models and says the manager and captains reflect the identity of the club. \u201cThe heart of the team is the heart of the coach. So the character of the coach will become the character of the team in the long term. That\u2019s it. Because there is no stronger weapon than your own example. If I\u2019m a disciplined coach, then I don\u2019t need to discipline the players. Our captains Hendo [Jordan Henderson] and Milly, together with Virgil [van Dijk], are so disciplined, which means the rest of the group doesn\u2019t need to be disciplined. There is a saying from [Theodore] Roosevelt which says: \u2018People don\u2019t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.\u2019 \u201cJ\u00fcrgen does really care about the squad and his staff. Players will understand and absorb more of our philosophy when they feel how much we care about them.\u201d The philosophy is about playing football in its most attacking shape. \u201cWe always focus on ourselves, attack the opponent with \u2013 but especially without \u2013 the ball; a chasing attitude over 95 minutes. \u201cSo our way of playing is central element in our training sessions. But I also look to details of opponents which can give us an advantage, like spaces they might leave open or other weaknesses which we can exploit. I always try to interweave those elements in our sessions without the players noticing it.\u201d He believes, though, that \u201c75 % of the opponents we\u2019ve played against so far in the Premier League changed something in their formation beforehand\u201d. In his first season at Liverpool Lijnders was occasionally invited to Melwood by Rodgers to talk about counterpressing and Lijnders\u2019 interpretation of 3-4-3. Lijnders impressed Rodgers with his tactical insights and accepted an offer to join the first-team staff but stayed connected to the academy, where he had created a group in which the best players from different age groups were brought together. One player to emerge from this pool was Trent Alexander-Arnold. Rodgers left shortly after promoting Lijnders but Klopp kept the Dutchman as first-team coach. They appeared to complement each other, so the manager was sad to see Lijnders leave in January 2018 for a managerial role at NEC in the Netherlands. So upset, in fact, that he swiftly offered Lijnders the chance to return as his assistant. \u201cHe was convinced we could conquer a lot together,\u201d says Lijnders, who accepted Klopp\u2019s offer and left NEC after half a season at the end of which the team lost in the promotion play-offs. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen can touch someone straight to the heart. He knows exactly what he wants and when we were on the phone it felt just right.\u201d Since then Liverpool have become even better, with an increased tactical flexibility and intensity. Lijnders picks out another Klopp strength: \u201cHe is able to give a completely different perception to a situation inside a few minutes.\u201d Lijnders gives an example of the game at Barcelona last season. \u201cWe lost 3-0, but afterwards J\u00fcrgen said in the dressing room: \u2018The only team in the world who can overturn this defeat against Barcelona is us.\u2019 It gave the squad a boost, also because of the way we had played that night. When the players walked towards the coach there was already a different feeling.\u201d Lijnders\u2019 bond with Klopp goes beyond a professional relationship. Occasionally they meet at their homes but most of the time they are at Melwood, where they spend even their down-time together. A glass cage adjacent to the Melwood building was specially built for Klopp and Lijnders to house a paddle tennis court. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of tennis and squash and because of the glass walls the ball can bounce, which keeps it in play,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cThe court is actually meant for two v two, so it\u2019s not only a battle against each other, but also yourself.\u201d The initial idea was to build a court beside one of their houses, at a time when they lived close to each other, but a court at the club made more sense. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. Perhaps we play two to three times a week, sometimes more often.\u201d On the day of this interview they have a paddle tennis match scheduled just after a joint meeting and a few hours before they lead training. \u201cA perfect way to switch off,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cYou can\u2019t play without 100% concentration. For us it\u2019s great to just think about nothing during those games. And sometimes it is in these moments that we find a brilliant solution for something.\u201d In everything Lijnders does preparation is key. He has learned the smallest details can make the biggest difference. On the day of the return leg against Barcelona he sent a message via club staff instructing the ball boys to throw back balls as quickly as possible. \u201cThey can make a difference tonight, we need everyone on the top of their toes,\u201d Lijnders wrote in his message. The decisive fourth goal came after Alexander-Arnold received the ball very quickly from a ball boy to take a corner which Divock Origi slotted home. So the final became a reality and enabled Lijnders to continue working on his preparations for Madrid. And there, after 21 seconds, he realised that those early investments had paid off.
