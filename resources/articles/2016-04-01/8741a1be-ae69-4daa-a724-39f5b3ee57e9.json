Downing Street said \u201cintense lobbying\u201d by British officials had helped stop the European commission from tearing up the so-called Dublin regulation, which says refugees have to claim asylum in the first European country they arrive in. But the proposals to be unveiled by the commission on Wednesday, which have been seen by the Guardian, do not point to such a clear outcome for the UK as Downing street has claimed. Instead, plans to scrap the Dublin regulation is still on the table as one option, in a move that would pave the way for a mandatory redistribution system for asylum seekers based on a country\u2019s wealth and ability to absorb newcomers. A second option would preserve the existing rule, but add a \u201ccorrective fairness mechanism\u201d so refugees could be redistributed in times of crisis to take the pressure off arrival states. The \u201ccorrective fairness mechanism\u201d would be based on an existing scheme, where member states have agreed to resettle 160,000 Syrian refugees from Greece and Italy to other EU countries. But in the first six months of operation, barely 1,000 refugees have been resettled under the scheme, raising questions about its viability. EU officials have stressed that since January the UK, could opt out of EU asylum policy but has chosen not to do so. Successive governments have preferred to opt into the Dublin regime because it allows the UK to deport asylum seekers to the first EU country they entered. A government source said: \u201cWe have lobbied hard to ensure that we can retain the right to return asylum seekers to the countries where they arrive and it looks like we\u2019ve succeeded in persuading the European commission to put this into the proposals. \u201cIt shows that when you stand up for Britain in Brussels, we can get what we need.\u201d Officials are trying to use the situation to make a pro-EU argument by saying the UK has achieved the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d \u2013 keeping its seat at the table but avoiding opting in to what he described as \u201cmigrant relocation\u201d. \u201cA vote to leave the EU would mean the Dublin regulation would be gone for good, so thousands more asylum seeker reaching our shores would have the chance of staying put,\u201d the government source said, adding that the powers had been used to return 12,000 asylum seekers since 2005. But Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said: \u201cBeing subject to the Dublin regulations result in hardly any removals from the UK but do leave EU judges in complete control of our asylum system. Just like the \u00a3350m we give to Brussels each week, that represents a bad deal for Britain. \u201cIf we want a humane asylum policy that we can hold accountable and ensure is in our national interest, the only safe option is to vote leave.\u201d Campaigners have described the push to maintain the Dublin regulation and not share the burden of the refugee council as appalling. They are likely to be outraged that the government has been actively lobbying in this way. It comes after Cameron rejected a call by the House of Lords to take 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the liberal group in the European parliament, urged member states to agree \u201ca new EU asylum system based on a fair distribution scheme\u201d. He said: \u201cThe overhaul of the Dublin agreement is an essential step if we are to put in place a much-needed collective European response to the refugee crisis. Under the Dublin regulation, we have witnessed a race to the bottom in which Member States compete to become the least attractive for refugees; but this has paralysed Europe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
