Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back shortly for Kevin Mitchell\u2019s full match report. Djokovic is into a seventh US Open final, which ties him with Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors for third most in the Open era. He\u2019s now won seven straight grand slam semi-final matches since a 2014 loss on this very court to Kei Nishikori, who will face Stan Wawrinka in today\u2019s second match. A workmanlike win for Djokovic but questions over his serve will persist after one ace and seven double faults. \u201cHumid,\u201d he says during an on-court interview when asked to describe the match. \u201cI think that\u2019s all we were thinking about and feeling the last couple of sets. Conditions were quite different from most of the days of this tournament. It\u2019s the same for the both of us we kind of expected it.\u201d Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 Monfils Djokovic is two points away from the finish line after a backhand winner followed by a Monfils unforced error. Monfils misses on a backhand volley and he will face three match points. Djokovic then crushes a forehand winner to break Monfils at love \u2013 of course \u2013 and move through to the final! Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 5-2 Monfils* (*denotes next server) At 30-all, Djokovic pounds a forehand winner then forces Monfils into an error for the hold. Monfils will now serve to stay in the tournament. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 4-2 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils double-faults followed by a Djokovic error, but another double fault puts him in a 15-30 hole. He forces Djokovic into an error for 30-all, but an unforced error on a backhand volley gives Djokovic a break-point chance. Monfils saves it, then forces Djokovic into another error for game point. Unforced error by Monfils returns it to deuce, but a pair of unforced errors costs him the break. It\u2019s a medical timeout, which explains why Monfils has left the court. The trainer is working on Djokovic\u2019s right shoulder. He\u2019s apparently also requested an ice blanket. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 3-2 Monfils* (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Monfils pushes Djokovic way back with a forehand and forces an error for 15-30. A half-chance here for the Frenchman to get back on level terms in the fourth. Djokovic makes another error and now Monfils has a pair of break-point chances. And Djokovic double-faults! Looks like he\u2019s cramped up. The trainer is out to treat him during the changeover. Monfils has left the court. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 3-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) Danger zone for Monfils as he loses three straight points from 15-0 and now faces a pair of break points. He saves the first but commits an unforced error on the second and Djokovic has the break. Finish line in sight for the world No1. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 2-1 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Djokovic with a reasonably easy hold. Monfils orders a Coke during the changeover. Unreal. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 1-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils takes a seat \u2013 it\u2019s not a changeover, mind \u2013 and the trainer comes out but he receives no treatment. OK, then. He falls behind love-40 for a second straight service game and faces triple break point. Can he escape it once more? Saves the first by forcing Djokovic into a forehand error then the second and third on unforced errors by Djokovic from the backhand side. Monfils pounds a backhand winner for game point but follows with a double fault for deuce. But a Djokovic error followed by a Monfils forehand winner gives the Frenchman a hold from love-40 down for the second consecutive service game. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 1-0 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils fights back from 40-15 on Djokovic\u2019s serve for deuce then crushes a forehand winner for a break-point chance. Djokovic saves it and Monfils is doubled over. Is he tired or playing possum? Then a pair of errors by Monfils gives Djokovic the hold. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-6 Monfils Monfils loses another point on his second serve then commits an unforced error for love-30. Another forced error by Djokovic and he will have three looks at a break point. All three of these came on Monfils\u2019 second serve, where is 13 of 34 (38.2%) on the afternoon. He saves the first when Djokovic sends a backhand long, then the second on a forehand volley winner, then the third when Djokovic misses on a forehand. Monfils wins the next point to earn a set point and ... well, there\u2019s no other way to explain it but to say Djokovic has just torn his shirt in anger. It\u2019s dangling on his torso like a tunic. Monfils then coolly hits a backhand winner to take the second set and now the shirt has come off completely. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-5 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Djokovic blinks during a 16-stroke rally to lose the opening point. He rattles off three straight for a game point, but Monfils hits an overhand winner for 40-30. The Frenchman sprints across the court to retrieve a drop shot and Djokovic hits the volley out for deuce. Now Djokovic nets a forehand early in the rally and Monfils has a break point to take the third set! The crowd swells. Djokovic tries another drop shot which Monfils manages to retrieve but this time Djokovic places the volley perfectly for a winner. Djokovic wins the next point and Monfils pauses on the baseline with a tow, looking a bit winded. Now a booming serve by Djokovic that Monfils can\u2019t return into the court and the Serb has the hold. Monfils now will try to serve out the third set. Third set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-5 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils backs up the break with a stress-free hold. He\u2019s won 20 of the last 27 points. Djokovic now to serve to stay in the third set. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-4 Monfils* (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Monfils hits a pair of winners to set up a pair of break-point chances. The crowd, who had jeered his perceived apathy earlier this set, is really buzzing now. Djokovic saves the first but an unforced error on the second gives Monfils the break! Third set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-3 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils crushes a 132mph ace on the opening point. He walks up to inspect the mark and looks to chair umpire Eva Asderaki to challenge, but she rules that he\u2019s taken too long. Doesn\u2019t look very happy about it. Djokovic levels at 15-all on a Monfils error, but the Frenchman wins the next three points \u2013 the third on a 138mph ace down the middle \u2013 for the crucial hold. Now can he make any headway on the top seed\u2019s serve? Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-2 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Serving at 15-all, Djokovic double-faults and then sends a backhand sailing. Two break-point chances for Monfils. Djokovic saves the first with a hard backhand that Monfils can\u2019t handle, but Monfils converts the second with an angled forehand volley on the run to cap a 10-stroke rally \u2013 perhaps the point of the match! \u2013 and they\u2019re back on serve in the third. A massive service game for the Frenchman forthcoming. Third set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) Signs of life for Monfils as he booms a 126mph ace, then forced Djokovic into an error for 30-love. Drops the next point on an error but closes out the hold with consecutive aces of 129mph and 133mph \u2013 his eighth and ninth of the match. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-0 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils hits a winner for love-15, but Djokovic rattles off four quick points to consolidate the break. He\u2019s won 12 of the last 14 points. Third set: *Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 1-0 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils\u2019 first serve is short-circuiting again. He falls behind love-30 and 15-40 then double-faults to surrender the break. A completely listless performance from the Frenchman and he\u2019s hearing it from the crowd. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2 Monfils Another easy hold for Djokovic, who won 14 of 16 first-serve points and took the set in 29 minutes. Alarmingly, Monfils came up limping badly after dropping the last point. Monfils is 2-18 when dropping the first two sets at majors. Both wins came in the first round of the Australian Open: against Thiemo De Bakker in 2011 and Lucas Pouille last year. Meanwhile, Djokovic is 165-1 when winning the first two sets in grand slam play. Second set: *Djokovic 6-3, 5-2 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils sprints out to 40-love but then goes double fault, netted volley, double fault for deuce. He\u2019s able to dig out the hold but not without more unnecessary drama. Djokovic will try to serve for a two-sets-to-none lead. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 5-1 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Another elementary hold for Djokovic. Monfils hasn\u2019t been able to get a whiff on the world No1\u2019s serve since the final game of the opener. Djokovic has won 12 of 14 points on his serve this set. Second set: *Djokovic 6-3, 4-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) Two more unforced errors by Monfils, who has lost 15 of the last 16 points. He crunches back-to-back aces out wide \u2013 114mph and 132mph \u2013 but then makes unforced errors to end a pair of lengthy rallies and he\u2019s broken again. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 3-1 Monfils* (*denotes next server) A stress-free hold for Djokovic, the only blemish a forehand into the net. The top seed is dealing now. Second set: *Djokovic 6-3, 2-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) More pressure on Monfils as he falls behind love-30. Then he commits two more unforced errors on backhand volleys at the net and Djokovic breaks at love. The world No1 is back after a brief walkabout. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 1-1 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils couldn\u2019t get a first serve in to save his life earlier but he\u2019s done better of late. Gets the first four in here as they trade points for 30-all. Djokovic forces Monfils into an error and he will have a break-point chance, but he saves it with a service winner. Monfils wins the next point then caps a 21-stroke rally with a backhand winner for the hard-won hold. First set: Djokovic 6-3 Monfils Djokovic falls behind love-15 when he misses a backhand volley at the net, but then crushes a 118mph ace out wide for 15-all. Now Monfils pounds a backhand winner down the line and it\u2019s 15-30. Now an unforced error by Djokovic gives Monfils two break-point chances. Djokovic saves the first when Monfils sprays a backhand wide, then the second with a booming serve that the Frenchman can barely get a racket on. A forehand overhand winner by Djokovic sets up a fifth set point and this time he converts it. He\u2019s won the first set and Monfils will serve to open the second. Here\u2019s an email from reader Maria Zubair: Djokovic losing his cool so early in the game. So uncool. If Monfils creates and upset today, it\u2019ll all be on Djoker. First set: *Djokovic 5-3 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils starting to get his first serves in. He wins the first two points, double-faults, then hits a backhand winner for 40-15. Then he pounds and overhand winner at the net for the stress-free hold. Suddenly, a important service game for the world No1. First set: Djokovic 5-2 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Djokovic races out to 40-love and he will have three set points. Djokovic squanders one on a double fault, then a second on an unforced error at the net. Then Monfils saves the third with an attempted forehand pass that Djokovic nets for deuce. That\u2019s the fourth set point he\u2019s saved. Djokovic then snaps at somebody to \u201cpay attention a little bit\u201d \u2013 possibly chair umpire Eva Asderaki? It\u2019s unclear. But he\u2019s clearly distracted. Now Djokovic double-faults again and Monfils has his first break-point chance. He saves it with a big first serve that Monfils can\u2019t handle, but another careless forehand error gives Monfils a second look at a break. This time he converts when Djokovic double-faults for the second time in seven points. First set: *Djokovic 5-1 Monfils (*denotes next server) Djokovic falls behind love-30 and he\u2019s two points from a bagel. He fights back for 30-all but then mixes in an unforced error to give Djokovic a set point. The Frenchman saves it with a second-serve ace that clocks at 126mph. A forehand winner to cap a 15-stroke rally \u2013 longest of the match so far \u2013 gives him a game point. Then he pounds a 130mph ace out wide to get on the board. Djokovic now will try to serve it out. First set: Djokovic 5-0 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils keeps step with Djokovic for 30-all, but makes another unforced error on the backhand side and then is forced into a forehand error. Now he will serve to stay in the first set and avoid a bagel in the opener. First set: *Djokovic 4-0 Monfils (*denotes next server) Monfils double-faults again for 15-all and falls behind 15-40. His serve, normally an area of strength, is really betraying him early. He fights back for 40-all, but Djokovic forces him into an error for another break-point chance. Then Monfils double-faults again! And he\u2019s down a double break hardly 10 minutes in. A nightmarish start. First set: Djokovic 3-0 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Djokovic holds at love. But during the changeover, he complains to the chair umpire about the LED lights. He\u2019s told they are on for television since the match will likely end under darkness. \u201cGuess TV is more important than the players. It\u2019s not the first time,\u201d he says. First set: *Djokovic 2-0 Monfils (*denotes next server) From 30-all, Monfils double-faults ... then double-faults again. Oh dear. He\u2019s broken in his first service game. Not the most auspicious start. First set: Djokovic 1-0 Monfils* (*denotes next server) Monfils loses the opening point with an unforced error on the backhand side and Djokovic follows with one of his own for 15-all. Monfils hits a forehand winner to put Djokovic in a 15-30 hole, but another unforced error levels it at 30-all. Backhand volley winner by Djokovic sets up game point. He goes appears to miss on a forehand winner, but a challenge confirms the ball was in and the top seed holds to open. It\u2019s 93F on court with 60% humidity. Thunderstorms in the forecast between 3 and 8pm, so this one could finish under the roof. Monfils won the toss and he opts to return first. And the players are on court for their warm-ups. The top-seeded Serb has won all 12 meetings against Monfils at the tour level, though the Frenchman did beat Djokovic in the quarters of the Italy F4 Futures in 2004. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today\u2019s first men\u2019s semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Ga\u00ebl Monfils. While we wait for the players to take the court, here\u2019s a look at some notes on the matchup courtesy of the ATP: Thus far this season, Novak Djokovic tied an all-time record with his sixth Australian Open championship, became the first tennis player to surpass $100 million in prize money, and joined Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men to hold all four major titles at once. But this week in Flushing Meadows, he\u2019s making a different kind of history. Injuries to Jiri Vesely\u2019s forearm, Mikhail Youzhny\u2019s hamstring and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga\u2019s knee made Djokovic the first men\u2019s player in the Open Era to reach a grand slam semi-final following three retirements and/or walkovers. Djokovic\u2019s nine sets and 84 games completed are the fewest en route to a semi at any major in the Open era that featured a 128 draw and only best-of-five set matches. Should Djokovic win his third US Open, the numbers to beat belong to John McEnroe, who played 16 sets and 150 games to secure his first major title at the 1979 US Open. Djokovic\u2019s opponent on Friday, No10 seed Ga\u00ebl Monfils, has enjoyed a smooth road of his own to the semi-finals. Monfils is the 10th player in the last 25 years to reach the US Open semi-finals without dropping a set. However, eight of the previous nine players did not win the title, and no US Open champion during the Open era has ever had a perfect set record. The bad omens only start there for Monfils, who is 0-12 against Djokovic dating back to the 2005 US Open. Both 18 years old at the time, Monfils and Djokovic engaged a five-set, first-round match that lasted four hours and two minutes. Djokovic overcame shoulder pain and cramps to win 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(5), 0-6, 7-5. Monfils\u2019 four-set loss to Roger Federer at 2008 Roland Garros started a string of eight straight defeats suffered by Frenchmen in grand slam semi-finals. Djokovic was responsible for two of those losses, beating Tsonga at 2011 Wimbledon and Richard Gasquet at 2015 Wimbledon as part of his 53-1 run against French opponents. Currently, Djokovic has won 16 straight matches overall against Frenchmen and 22 in a row at grand slam tournaments. Plenty more to come from Flushing Meadows. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a full match! Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, read how Serena Williams\u2019s bid for the title was ended by Karolina Pliskova: An eerie hush fell over Arthur Ashe Stadium after Williams double-faulted on match point in the second-set tiebreaker, closing the show at 6-2, 7-6 (5) and ensuring Pliskova\u2019s shock passage into Saturday\u2019s final after 86 minutes. The outcome cost Williams not only a chance at a history-making 23rd grand slam title to eclipse Steffi Graf\u2019s professional-era mark for major championships but also the No1 ranking that she\u2019s held since February 2013 \u2013 a span of 186 weeks that equaled Graf\u2019s record for consecutive weeks on top. It marks the second straight year Williams has fallen at the penultimate hurdle in a bid for history at the season-ending major. Last September, a three-set loss to the unseeded Italian Roberta Vinci torpedoed her challenge for a calendar-year grand slam. On Thursday, the saboteur was a slender Czech all but unknown to casual observers due to her chronic underperformance in the early rounds of the sport\u2019s four bedrock tournaments.
