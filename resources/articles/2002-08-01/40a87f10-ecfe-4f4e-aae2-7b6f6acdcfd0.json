Now, 14 months later, everyone in golf knows who Beem is: the winner of the 2002 US PGA Championship here in Chaska, Minnesota. His win is perhaps the most shocking in a major championship since Paul Lawrie won the Open at Carnoustie in 1999. Furthermore he held off one of the greatest finishes ever seen when Tiger Woods, who had been five behind after 14 holes, completed his round with four successive birdies. It was too late, but only just. Beem arrived on the 18th with a two-stroke lead and could afford to three-putt that green - which he did - and still win. His total of 278, 10 under par, was good enough to beat Woods by a solitary stroke and win him $990,000 (\u00a3650,000). That three-putt was his only one of the week and, as it did not matter, hardly counts. Beem was the best player on the green with a total of 107 putts, two fewer than Jim Furyk, who finished ninth, and David Duval, who tied for 34th. Beem putted beautifully all week, but in the final round it was the timing and the length of the ones he holed that was important. The biggest, in length and importance, was the 50-footer at the 16th. It came in the middle of the Woods birdie binge and meant he could bogey the last and still win. \"I told you guys that if I arrived at the 16th leading by a couple I might puke,\" Beem, an engaging free spirit, told reporters at his post-championship press conference. \"But when I got there, leading by a couple, I was actually as committed to the tee shot as I've been to any shot I've ever hit. I hit a beautiful little seven-wood out there, a nine-iron in and what can I say about the putt? It was unbelievable.\" Earlier he had described some of his other thought processes. At the long 7th, for instance, he hit a good drive and knew that he had a birdie chance. He also knew there was a pond on the left of the green waiting for a mishit. \"I had, like, 260 to the hole or something like that and my caddie goes, 'Well what do you think?' \"I go, 'Well we really haven't backed off all week. Do you think we ought to now? I don't think so.'\" Nor did he. A three-wood found the green and bravery was rewarded. Eventually he reached the par-four 18th knowing he could take five. \"I took a deep breath on the tee,\" he said, \"and just whacked that sucker right down the middle. \"As I told you all week I had no expectation of playing this good. I didn't know if I had what it took to win and I'm actually still surprised at myself. Just to win any tournament is unbelievable and right now I'm so flabbergasted about this you have no idea.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
