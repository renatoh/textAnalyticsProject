The number attending seemed to be lower than for previous collaborations \u2013 one regular queue-goer estimated that it was about half that of previous years \u2013 but there was still a small snake of people outside H&amp;M Oxford Circus in London before the collection\u2019s 8am launch. Alexandra Lindblad, 26, had been waiting since 4am, while others had been there since midnight. \u201cThey have only 100 pieces of each, so if you\u2019re not here early, you don\u2019t get anything \u2013 and the website always crashes,\u201d she said. The haute couture-inspired collection, which also launched at other big stores across London, Dublin, Manchester and Birmingham (as well as online) is perhaps the fanciest of H&amp;M\u2019s designer collaborations so far. As Valli told Vogue earlier this year: \u201cI was very surprised and flattered [by H&amp;M\u2019s interest]. The idea is to bring the Valli DNA of extraordinary, of one-of-a-kind, of uniqueness, of couture.\u201d Shoppers described how they felt about having the chance to get their hand on his designs \u2013 popular with celebrities such as Rihanna, Amal Clooney and Ariana Grande, they usually go for thousands of pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s not really in my price range,\u201d said Lindblad, \u201cso any couturier, especially from Paris, is exciting.\u201d The collection\u2019s 41 pieces for women and 31 for men \u2013 the first time Valli has branched out into menswear \u2013 include embroidered coats for \u00a3299.99, a leopard print hoodie (\u00a359.99), logo tights, pearly jewellery and floaty floral dresses. There are jumpers decorated with rose prints and historical figures in ruffs (\u00a379.99), and knee-high socks adorned with pink hearts (\u00a314.99). This is a collaboration perhaps geared more towards the fashion-heads than previous H&amp;M offerings, as evidenced by those in the queue. Fashion student Nadia Roberts, 21, loves Valli\u2019s work: \u201cIt\u2019s just very beautiful, well-made couture.\u201d She had been queueing since 6.30am for a faux fur-trimmed aviator coat from the collection. Lindblad, who works for Christian Dior, thinks his work is interesting for being \u201ca little bit different shape-wise compared with what you normally find\u201d. While Anne-Marie Buckley, who has worked in fashion and has been familiar with his work for a long time, thinks \u201cit\u2019s very elegant and very feminine. I think at the moment things are very unstructured and hard-wearing, and I think he\u2019s delicate and fluid.\u201d It is, she said, a savvy pre-party season collaboration. Announced in May at the amfAR Gala in Cannes, the collection was unleashed at a show at Rome\u2019s grand palazzo in late October, where the model Kendall Jenner took over the runway in the collection\u2019s most hyped dress \u2013 large, red, frilly and available for \u00a3299.99. In recent years, Valli\u2019s couture collections have doubled down on the froufrou tulle frocks that found mainstream fans when a similarly voluminous Molly Goddard dress was worn by Jodie Comer in Killing Eve. Often compared to millefeuille, these colossi don\u2019t shout high street \u2013 and many in the queue admitted they were there for the more understated pieces. Lindblad knows she wouldn\u2019t be able to wear the Jenner dress: \u201cI\u2019m not fancy enough to go anywhere where that would work.\u201d On the other hand, Roberts thinks it\u2019s amazing, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone; you have to be going to somewhere very special. I wouldn\u2019t buy it because I\u2019m short.\u201d Other people were feeling bolder. A 21-year-old student Tara Genovese was at least hoping to try on the big red dress. But \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to have the occasion to wear that, so I\u2019m more looking at the red shirt or the little dress with flowers\u201d. Elina Sharifi\u2019s boyfriend told her the pink tulle dress she was planning to buy would \u201cmake her look like a bonbonniere, but I think for a special occasion it will be very beautiful.\u201d While Pam Oushal, 51, planned to wear the dress to a big wedding she is attending soon. Of its impracticality, she said: \u201cDarling, fashion is impractical. If it\u2019s day clothes, sure, but things like that are occasion-wear.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
