During a long-awaited confirmation hearing to make Dan Coats, until recently an amiable GOP senator from Indiana, the next director of national intelligence (DNI), several senators wondered whether Coats possesses the grit and the influence to represent the intelligence agencies amid an ongoing row with the White House over Russia and concern over the DNI\u2019s place in the national-security firmament. \u201cMy only concern about your nomination is you\u2019re one of the most likable, affable, easygoing people I\u2019ve ever met, and I liked traveling with you and working with you on this committee. I\u2019m not sure likability and affability are the qualities I want in this position,\u201d said Maine independent senator Angus King. King said he preferred \u201csomebody who\u2019s crusty and mean and tough\u201d, particularly when dealing with fractious intelligence agencies and Trump, \u201cwho may or may not want to hear what you have to say\u201d. Oklahoma Republican James Lankford echoed King: \u201cI really want the DNI to be able to be tough when it requires being tough and to be clear when it\u2019s time to be clear, because the policymakers around you need clarity, need straightforward facts.\u201d Coats, who was not close to Trump during the 2016 campaign, said that he had extensively discussed his position with the president and emphasized his independence. He said he told Trump: \u201c\u2018You need to fully understand my role. My role is to provide you the best intelligence to formulate policy, not formulate policy or be a spokesman for any political decisions that are made.\u2019 I have made this clear, and I will continue to make this clear.\u201d Coats is the first DNI nominee not to come from either the professional military, intelligence community or diplomatic service. He seeks to step into his role at a fraught time for US intelligence after being on the sidelines as Trump\u2019s early national security policies and priorities have coalesced. There is a palpable fear in US intelligence of being marginalized or pushed out as retaliation for assessing Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election for Trump\u2019s benefit. Those fears have been amplified by a potential intelligence review by a finance expert, Stephen Feinberg, close to chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Many in intelligence circles are trying to understand whether Coats will have influence with Trump or whether Trump prefers his CIA director, Mike Pompeo. Coats told senators he believed any review Feinberg conducts ought to fall under the DNI\u2019s authority. Continuing a months-long feud with the US intelligence agencies, Trump has accused career intelligence officials of leaks about his associates\u2019 closeness with Russia and castigated them as holdovers from Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees have begun inquiries into the Trump-Russia ties, though partisan factionalism on the panels has emerged into public view. Coats pledged to extensively cooperate with the congressional probes, saying the Russia question \u201cneeds to be investigated and addressed\u201d. Coats\u2019s absence from policy debates, according to Capitol Hill sources, derives in part from the Senate panel opting to thoroughly vet an old colleague. But it followed reports during the transition that Trump would diminish the role of the office of the director of national intelligence, whose incumbent at the time, James Clapper, was the public face of the Trump-Russia assessment. Though Trump aides denied those reports, Trump\u2019s restructuring of the National Security Council through executive order removed a permanent seat for the director on the powerful principals committee and ultimately gave it to CIA director Pompeo. That restoration of the centrality of the CIA director, reversing a trend set by a 2004 structural reform emerging from the 9/11 commission, has raised questions about Coats\u2019s relevance. Coats said he had received verbal assurances \u201cover and over and over\u201d from Trump and his staff that he will have full access to the NSC committee: \u201cI was informed that the drafting of that executive order was not intending to not have the director of national intelligence as part of the principals committee.\u201d But under questioning, Coats appeared misinformed about a subsequent modification of the order that give Pompeo a seat. Coats said he had delivered to the White House \u201cinformation as to how to modify\u201d the NSC order \u2013 but did not know a date by which it would actually be modified. He also seemed willing to take the DNI position even without its full NSC principals-committee authorities. \u201cMy concern is that there has been no indication or assurance given that you will, if confirmed, actually be a member of that body and I\u2019d like to know, from you, if that does not happen, will you be prepared to still assume the responsibilities without the authority that you would have if you were a member of that body?\u201d asked California Democrat Kamala Harris. \u201cI\u2019m fully prepared to assume the responsibilities,\u201d Coats replied. Harris appeared puzzled: \u201cEven if you are not \u2013 if the executive order is not modified?\u201d \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019ve been assured that I have the authority to be a member of that committee and be at that committee at every one of its meetings,\u201d Coats said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly comfortable with it, because I trust them and I believe what they\u2019ve told me and I intend to do this.\u201d On a critical surveillance issue, Coats said he considered the reauthorization of an expiring legal authority for the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance dragnets a 2017 priority. But he equivocated on providing to the committee a long-sought estimate of how many Americans\u2019 communications have been caught in those nets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
