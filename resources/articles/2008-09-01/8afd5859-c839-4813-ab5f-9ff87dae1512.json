In recent seasons under the influence of its creative director, Frida Giannini, the Italian label has undergone a more feminine recalibration and its new focus can be summed up as the \"deluxe rock\" look. On the catwalk last night the Gucci Exotica collection took the form of brightly coloured skinny rock-boy trouser suits mixed with tropical print shirts and topped off with trilby hats. The trousers were loosened around the hips, then tapered and turned up at the ankle. A shape that looks right, partly because it can already be found on the high street at the moment, which suggests this cut could be stale come next summer when these clothes go on sale. Best were the accessories. Unsurprisingly, they are the main reason why Gucci continues to thrive in uncertain economic conditions. By next summer expect Gucci fans to be wearing platform high-heel sandals fastened with a triple strap at the ankle and carrying super-luxurious leather rucksacks. Earlier in the day, 72-year-old Roberto Cavalli opened his show with a selection of white breezy chiffon long-sleeve dresses buttoned to the neck - demure in shape but entirely see-through. Bustles created from multiple frills appeared on the rear of many of the shorter hemmed dresses; imagine a pair of fussy retro tennis knickers and you get the picture. The collection was inspired in part by Brigitte Bardot in the 1965 film Viva Maria! It is the story of a girl who joins the circus and accidentally invents striptease. The Bardot influence could be seen in the tousled hair and smoky-eyed make-up but the overall effect was more Little Bo Peep meets Saint-Tropez It-Girl."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
