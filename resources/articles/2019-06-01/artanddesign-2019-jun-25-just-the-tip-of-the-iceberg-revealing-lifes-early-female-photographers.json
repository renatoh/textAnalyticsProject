Among them, \u201cto see man\u2019s work \u2013 his paintings, towers and discoveries\u201d. What we don\u2019t realize is his vision was partly captured by the female gaze and now, the photography of six women, who were on staff at Life, will be on view at the New York Historical Society. The exhibition, Life: Six Women Photographers, features more than 70 images by the women who worked there between the 1930s and 1970s \u2013 a time when female photojournalists were a rarity. \u201cMany of these women are not known, they\u2019re not even in photography history books,\u201d said Marilyn Kushner, who co-curated the exhibit with Sarah Gordon, Erin Levitsky and William J Simmons. \u201cThese women have not gotten their due, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d Kushner wanted to draw attention to the work of these overlooked women by featuring some of their best work; from war photos to weddings, from capturing women\u2019s housework to images of soldiers and labor unions. Their contribution to the magazine inevitably expanded, or changed, Luce\u2019s initial vision of putting the lens on \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d. Kushner and her curatorial team started out by sifting through thousands of photos at the Life Picture Collection. \u201cOne thing that came to mind was what about the women photographers; who were they?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt turns out, there were less than 10 women photogs on staff, so we wanted to highlight them as an integral part of what was going on at the magazine.\u201d The exhibit features the works of the Bronx-born photographer Margaret Bourke-White, one of the founding photojournalists at Life, whose photo of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana graced the cover of the magazine\u2019s first issue. She was also the first American female photographer to cover the second world war. There are also the works of the German photographer Hansel Mieth, who fled her hometown at the age of 15, to live in America. She covered working-class America in the 1930s and 1940s, and in 1938, she did a series about the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers, where she captured lively shots of female workers, many of who were smiling. \u201cThese photos have a female outlook,\u201d said Kushner, \u201cand some of these stories are best told by women.\u201d Also on view are photos by Lisa Larsen, who covered the cold war. She was assigned to cover the Kremlin visit of Yugoslavia\u2019s President Josip Broz Tito in 1956. While working in America, Larsen had also covered John F Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier\u2019s wedding in Newport in 1953. Life was a window to the world for many Americans. While photo-driven magazines were more common in Europe at the time, Life was the first of its kind in the US. What made Luce\u2019s vision so unique, was that he wanted photos to tell a story, rather than illustrate the words of writers. The photos were central to the magazine\u2019s success, and entire pages were filled with shots, alongside headlines and photo captions (in its early days, photographers were not credited directly beside the photos on the magazine\u2019s pages). This weekly news magazine ran until 1972, then, as a monthly until 2000. Among the more controversial photos at the time, Martha Holmes, who started shooting for the magazine in 1944, photographed the mixed-race crooner Billy Eckstine alongside a gaggle of white female fans in 1950. It was what Holmes considered to tell \u201cwhat the world should be like\u201d, the photographer once said. \u201cWhen that photo was taken, they weren\u2019t sure if they should put it into the issue \u2013 a white woman embracing a black man,\u201d said Kushner. \u201cBut Luce put it in there because he said: \u2018This is what the future is going to be. Run it.\u2019\u201d When the series of Eckstine were published, the photos garnered vicious letters to the editor, and it was said to have damaged Eckstine\u2019s career. One thing remained. \u201cLuce believed in America and he wanted to tell the stories about it,\u201d said Kushner. As America\u2019s first picture-driven magazine, it was so popular, people would wait every week to buy the magazine for a dime and look through the photos. \u201cA picture could tell a thousand words, if you could tell how to read it,\u201d she said. These women were not the first photojournalists. Women began shooting as early as the late 19th century, but that\u2019s another exhibition altogether, one that Kushner could be working on in the future. For these female photographers, they were just doing their jobs \u2013 to get the shot. \u201cWhen they tried to get a picture, they\u2019d have 10 men pushing them out of the way,\u201d said Kushner. \u201cAll they were worried about was taking the best photos they could get.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
