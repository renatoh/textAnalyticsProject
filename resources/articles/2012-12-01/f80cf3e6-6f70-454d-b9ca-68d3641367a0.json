Sterling turned 18 on 8 December without finalising the terms of his first professional contract, a situation that had alerted Chelsea and Manchester United among others to the possibility of signing the teenager for a compensation fee. Liverpool, however, had repeatedly insisted that Sterling, who won his first senior England cap against Sweden last month, would eventually commit his future to Anfield and a compromise deal was agreed during talks between Ian Ayre and the player's representatives this week. Confirmation of Sterling's new five-year contract is expected to be announced by the club within the next 48 hours. Sterling has been ever-present in the Premier League since making his full debut against Manchester City in August, although the manager, Brendan Rodgers, was reluctant to meet wage demands that had inflated following the winger's progress to the England senior team. The two parties have reached a compromise deal that will see the winger increasingly rewarded should he continue to progress at Anfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
