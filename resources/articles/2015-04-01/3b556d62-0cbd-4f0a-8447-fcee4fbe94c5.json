Crawley\u2019s 2-0 win lifts them from 22nd to 19th and drops County from 21st to 22nd. The position will be clearer after Tuesday, when five of the nine sides trying not to join Yeovil in relegation play their match in hand and everyone has two to play. County are at home to Preston but their home form is the worst in the division, with only one win since beating Crawley 5-3 in October. They ended that month in fourth, with 26 points from 14 games, before four wins in 23 saw the back of Shaun Derry as manager four weeks ago. The loan system may have backfired on them. Crawley, mid-table at the end of October, changed manager sooner. They had gone eight games without a league win when John Gregory stood down for heart surgery after Boxing Day. Dean Saunders, who replaced him, needed six games to end the run. He is still \u201cinterim\u201d manager which, in the nature of the game, most are as it happens. In a year and a half since taking Doncaster and Wolves down from the Championship he had identified players he would like to work with when he next got a chance. \u201cI was able to bring nine players in,\u201d he said last week. \u201cYour own players want to do well for you.\u201d His team as a whole have shown spectacularly erratic form, following a 5-0 defeat with a 5-1 victory in February, but this win was in line with three in a row against fellow strugglers in eight mid-March days and followed another 5-0 defeat, at Walsall. Moreover three of his own players were at the heart of it, two on loan \u2013 Andrew Wordsworth in his last game before returning to Ipswich and Darren Ward from Swindon \u2013 and Kelly Youga in his third game since joining from Wimbledon last month. The goals came in three minutes around the quarter-hour, each from a set-piece delivery by Wordsworth\u2019s deft left foot from the right. Youga, the left-back, met his corner with a stunning overhead volley. Ward, a centre-back, met his free-kick with a strong header. Both were unopposed. Roy Carroll, already surprised perhaps to find he was the junior goalkeeper at 37, had no time to blink. For the rest of the half Brian Jensen, 39, was the busier keeper, making sharp saves to deny headers by Jimmy Spencer and Garry Thompson and a late-sighted shot from Gary Jones. Thereafter Crawley were so well organised that County did not muster a shot. In fact the local Tory MP, Henry Smith, who went between the posts for the half-time kids\u2019 kickabout, could have stayed there for the second half, despite looking pushed to save even his own deposit. If his orange jersey did not betray Lib-Dem tendencies, he may have won a few votes for his team. Crawley were particularly interesting down the right where another Saunders signing, Mathias Pogba from Pescara, two years older than his brother Paul, shared the flank with Lewis Young, Ashley\u2019s brother, fore and aft of Josh Simpson, returning from five-month injury. He is the club\u2019s longest-serving player, dating from promotion to the League in 2011. So this was a meeting on frantic level terms between the oldest club in the world playing at professional level and one of the League\u2019s newest, each emerging from recent financial trauma in Middle Eastern hands \u2013 been there, done for that \u2013 though Crawley\u2019s Majeeds were born in Brighton. \u201cWe\u2019ve bounced back again, scoring two great goals from set plays we\u2019ve practised,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWe used the wind down the pitch, then managed the game really well.\u201d County, who for once were missing Liam Noble through injury not suspension (11 matches, three red cards, 13 yellow), escaped relegation on the final day last season. Such is their turnover that familiarity may be of no benefit. Moniz, his tight, shiny, black curls suggesting a poodle chasing a lost cause in water, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t create as much the moment Jamal [Campbell-Ryce] is injured.\u201d Of his pre-match remark he added: \u201cWe are dead now. Tomorrow we stand up.\u201d He had also said: \u201cYou have to step out of the past.\u201d And County have rather a lot of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
