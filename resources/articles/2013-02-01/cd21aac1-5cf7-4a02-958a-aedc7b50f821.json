A naturally ebullient character is measured and even a tad detached. He quickly tires of questions about Dublin 2011, a day that started with England on the trail of the grand slam and finished with the players, after a chastening 24-8 defeat, forced to watch the night match between France and Wales in Paris before being able to proclaim themselves champions. Not that they felt champion. \"It felt flat and it was not the way we wanted to win the title,\" says Ashton who, when he scored his try against Scotland last Saturday, moved into the top 10 on England's all-time list with 17. \"There was a big build-up to the game in the week and there was pressure on us. A few of us had not played in Dublin before and did not know what to expect. It went wrong from the start. We were hammered in the first half and Ireland did exactly the same to Wales last week. It is hard to come back from that.\" It continued to go wrong for the rest of the year, even if England returned to Dublin before the World Cup and won handsomely. They struggled to marry ability and attitude, walking on the wild side and falling some way short of a third successive World Cup final, although Ashton was the joint-top tryscorer in the tournament with France's Vincent Clerc. \"This England team is better than we were in 2011,\" says Ashton. \"Rather than looking back to what happened two years ago, we reflect on the game with Ireland last year when this side was together. It just feels different with England now. \"The team feels a lot closer together, everyone knows what we are aiming for and buys into the culture of the environment. The attitude of everyone is different to what it was then. I do not think we will see a repeat of what happened in Dublin in the 2011 Six Nations. We have not been beaten like that since the current group of coaches took over and changed both our step and the path we were on.\" Ashton ended a 14-month try drought for England when he scored against New Zealand at Twickenham in December. Then, as against Scotland, he came off his wing looking for the ball. Had he remained stationed on the right last Saturday, he would not have been involved much after an early blindside pass from Ben Youngs went slightly behind him. The Ireland wing Simon Zebo reacted to a similar pass against Wales by flicking the ball with the outside of his left boot and catching it without breaking stride. \"He is left-footed and I am not,\" says Ashton. \"I had never seen anyone do that and it showed he is a skilful bloke. My first reaction would have been to go for the ball with my hands. I would never have thought of doing what he did.\" Ireland are without Tommy Bowe on the wing, Andrew Trimble has been dropped and Luke Fitzgerald is making his way back after a long time out injured. Zebo and Craig Gilroy may be inexperienced, but they have profited from Ireland's conversion last autumn to a wider, faster-paced game. \"Zebo has been outstanding for Munster and Gilroy has taken his chance,\" says Ashton. \"We will have to watch out for them. I hope my try-scoring carries on: it is part of my job description, but the main thing is to play well and stay in the team. It was difficult to go so many games without getting a try, but being in this side makes you confident every time you have the ball because people will put you away in the right places. \"It is an honour to make the try-scoring top 10. I have only been involved for three years. I intend to be around for a long time and hope to top the list one day, but given the way the game has changed it is more difficult to score tries these days. What matters is that England are a good all-round team heading in the right direction.\" The showdown at the Aviva Stadium is being seen as a potential title decider, with France losing on the opening weekend and having to travel to Twickenham and Dublin in the next two rounds and the champions, Wales, in all sorts of disarray, fourth in the 2011 World Cup, first in the 2012 Six Nations but 10th in the first world rankings of 2013. \"It is way too premature to say that whoever wins on Sunday will go on to take the title or get the grand slam,\" says Ashton. \"This is a completely different tournament to what it was even five years ago, as Italy showed in beating France. Everyone can defeat anyone on their day and it is not about one match. \"We are away from home. We won our three matches on the road last year and playing in Dublin is not different to Paris or Edinburgh, and no more difficult than playing in Wales. Their fans are mad on rugby and want their team to win and, while much is being made of what happened to us two years ago, I think last year, when we beat Ireland at Twickenham, is more relevant. It was achieved by the current group of players and coaches and we can take a lot from it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
