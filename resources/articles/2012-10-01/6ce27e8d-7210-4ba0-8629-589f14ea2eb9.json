Gossip \u2013 plus police nods and winks \u2013 landed the press in the mire over the McCanns and Chris Jefferies. Gossip isn't proof of anything, no defence in a libel or any other court. I don't doubt that Jimmy Savile was a sordid reprobate. Enough slime has crept under the door. But the need to beware remains. ITV's Exposure was a television special, not silence in court. Witness victims, with one exception, stayed anonymous. People who said they burst into Savile's dressing room didn't ask how old the girls on his knee were, or take names and addresses. The most senior-sounding BBC witness, Wilfred De'Ath, is famous in later life mostly for doing two stints in prison after conning hotels out of goods and services. You can't see the DPP launching a prosecution on evidence like this. You can see a house libel lawyer reaching for his red pencil, fast. It's sickening as paedophilia turns to necrophilia along this avenue: but it shouldn't be instant mob justice meted out while bashing BBC \"cesspits\" as per usual. The corporation does have harshly difficult questions to answer, and has made a rare hash of its hapless voyage from no inquiries to three. But, failing the discovery of damning paperwork in Broadcasting House, the silt of decades will probably cover past omissions. What's more immediately relevant, though, is self-strangulation by codes of practice. Why didn't Newsnight air its toxic 12 minutes last November? Cesspit sniffers suggest a shrinking embarrassment over Savile tribute shows; a platoon of independent investigators prepare to move in. But, given the way reporters at the BBC or elsewhere get their stories out regardless, secret edicts seem far too much of a stretch. What is more glumly convincing is the first of the reasons Peter Rippon of Newsnight gave: that his programme doesn't do celebrity expos\u00e9s, so they'd had to look for a \"public interest\" angle \u2013 in this case, the allegation that Surrey police hadn't investigated Savile diligently enough. But when it was decided that the police had done a reasonable job, it wasn't a Newsnight\"issue\" any longer, just a plain old, dirty old sensation. Ugh! Take it away\u2026 But whose story was it anyway? Only a couple of regular BBC TV programmes supposedly delve below the surface of events: Newsnight, strong on debate and eurozone policy, but not on less discursive events; and Panorama, flagship of pomp and circumstance. Should the Savile gossip have come its way from the start? Not unless it had been fully tested. Think of the fuss if the BBC had begun digging up its erstwhile hero's grave within a few days of his death. But now, please note with a sigh, Panorama is able to do a programme \u2013 because there's \"public interest\" in seeing what happened at Newsnight. Here's the curse of the codes, then. You can never do a straightforwardly interesting story because straight-forward lacks proper portent. You can never find a celebrity far out of order unless his tale carries weighty lessons. You can't touch a screaming-headline saga of human beastliness unless some otherwise deplorable organ has broached it first. Our upmarket press hardly questioned Sir Jimmy through the decades. Our downmarket press didn't manage to turn \"everyone knows\" into anything they could print. And so the beastliness went on. A redtop failure, you may say (as they had the brass neck to imply on Newsnight itself last week), a failure to act in the public interest. But why, from Langham Place down, are we doomed to sit mum over stinky things unless the ghost of the News of the World gives us an excuse to dig? The most fundamental public interest is finding out what's going on, basic and unadorned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
