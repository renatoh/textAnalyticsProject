After Jones\u2019s side failed to complete consecutive grand slams, Gatland also suggested Hartley, who is still among the bookies\u2019 favourites to be Lions captain, was under increasing pressure from England\u2019s backup No2 Jamie George. Hartley has started all 18 England matches under Jones but came into the championship lacking match sharpness and was replaced by George before the hour mark in all five Six Nations games. Brearley was England\u2019s inspirational captain during the 1981 Ashes series but while his leadership was lauded, his batting stats \u2013 he failed to make a Test century in his career \u2013 were not up to scratch, prompting continued debate over whether he warranted a place in the side. \u201cDylan is an outstanding captain. I\u2019m not discussing Lions selection but he is an outstanding captain for us and does a super job. There\u2019s no reason why he won\u2019t continue to do a super job,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when Mike Brearley captained the England cricket team; everyone questioned him, then he won the Ashes and no one questioned him. \u201cI thought he was better than he was in November \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason why, the next time he comes in, he can\u2019t be better than he was this time. As long as he keeps improving, he\u2019s in the right direction, like every other player.\u201d Jones is adamant England\u2019s 2019 World Cup plan remains intact despite a first defeat under his and Hartley\u2019s tenure. \u201cIt\u2019s not great to lose but it\u2019s a great learning experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no scar there at all. Those sorts of things harden you because you learn from them and you don\u2019t want them to happen again.\u201d He brushed off England\u2019s failure to surpass New Zealand\u2019s 18-match winning streak by pointing to the All Blacks\u2019 24-year wait to win the World Cup. Without what Jones believes may be as many as 15 players on the Lions tour of New Zealand, Jones will take a developmental squad to Argentina in the summer before an autumn campaign that he hopes will kick off with the mooted fixture against the All Blacks on 4 November. \u201cYou guys know the history of rugby. You know what the All Blacks had to go through to win the World Cup in 2011,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lost the semi-final against us in 2003 in Australia, they lost the quarter-final in 2007. They got to the final in 2011 and they had to have a very kind referee to get them home. That\u2019s how hard it is for them to win. So to lose the grand slam game when we\u2019ve already got the trophy is hardly a scar, it\u2019s a learning experience. \u201cI think New Zealand are there for the taking. You\u2019ve got to play well against them; play smart against them, but the sort of personnel the Lions could field against them, could be the sort of team that could do that. But you\u2019ve got to win that first Test. That is winner-takes-all. If you don\u2019t win that first Test, you\u2019re out of the series. I\u2019m sure Warren knows that. As I said we are very keen to play that game [on 4 November] and if it comes across we will be well prepared.\u201d Jones also challenged his side to make history by winning a third consecutive Six Nations title next year. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever won three [Six Nations] in a row,\u201d he said. \u201cTo win grand slams you\u2019ve got to be at your best five games in a row. There\u2019s a cycle to performance and it\u2019s hard to put together more than three games. Look at Word Cup games \u2013 the teams that win World Cups always have a performance that is slightly off.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
