The Australia international, a close friend of his compatriot, the Everton midfielder Tim Cahill, is a free agent after failing to agree an extension to his \u00a380,000-a-week contract at West Ham in the summer. Proposed moves to Sunderland and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid also collapsed over the 31-year-old's personal terms but Everton hope the defender's ongoing search for a club will persuade him to accept a deal of about \u00a340,000 a week. The manager, David Moyes, is desperate for reinforcements at right- and left-back, with the new \u00a36.3m signing John Heitinga likely to be required in central midfield following the loss of Phil Neville to a serious knee injury at Fulham on Sunday. He will be out for three months. Negotiations between Everton and Neill's representatives are continuing and, if concluded swiftly and should the defender prove his fitness, he could make his debut against his former club Blackburn on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
