It brought to an end Glenn Hoddle's dogged pursuit of the elegant, injury-plagued 28-year-old and returned Redknapp to the club where it all began for him as a schoolboy. The midfielder has been released by Liverpool, but will not figure for Spurs until next season with the move to White Hart Lane taking place well beyond the transfer deadline. But Redknapp is more than happy to bide his time and is chuffed with his move to the capital. \"I'm delighted. It's all happened quite quickly over the last couple of days,\" said Redknapp. \"There has been a lot of speculation because I was running to the end of my contract at Liverpool and they knew I was a free agent and was maybe going to leave but they've been fantastic with me - as they've always been.\" The midfielder is looking forward to renewing his working relationship with Hoddle, having played for the Tottenham manager during his time as the England national coach. \"I've got on with him [Hoddle] very well in the past and he's keen to get me here. I'm positive about things - I've had injuries but I'm fit now and I want to come and do a good job for Tottenham,\" he said. Although he was Liverpool's longest-serving player, it was typical that Redknapp only made eight appearances this season and when he returned to the team last August it was for the first time in a year. Hoddle admired Redknapp's vision and ability to open games up with his long-passing game, plus his capacity for the occasional spectacular and powerful shot. Those talents won him 17 England caps. It is likely Hoddle will use him both in midfield and as an occasional sweeper in Spurs' 3-5-2 system and Redknapp's main competition will come from Goran Bunjevcevic, who was signed last summer but has also been plagued by thigh, ankle and cheek injuries. Redknapp's departure is the start of an Anfield clearance as G\u00e9rard Houllier prepares to sign new players, who include Feyenoord's Brett Emerton. Patrick Berger and Vladimir Smicer, like the Coventry-bound Gary McAllister, may also leave Anfield. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
