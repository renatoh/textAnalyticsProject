Now Torak is on the trail of Renn, who has disappeared without a word. \u201cTracking was what Torak did best, and even by starlight he found Renn\u2019s three-day-old trail. To his alarm, it didn\u2019t lead towards the valley where the clan was camped, but down to the River Blackthorn where he and Renn kept their canoe. The canoe was gone,\u201d Paver writes, before sending her stone age boy and his wolf on a quest to the far north, where they\u2019ll be hunted by ice bears, and face their most evil enemy yet. It\u2019s wonderful \u2013 sheer escapism, for children and adults alike. \u201cI missed them acutely when I finished Ghost Hunter,\u201d says Paver now, who has spent the interim years publishing a handful of critically acclaimed novels for adults, from the terrifying ghost story Dark Matter and Thin Air, where five Englishmen set out to climb Kangchenjunga and which was described as a \u201ca heart-freezing masterpiece\u201d by the Observer. \u201cIt was immersive and great fun to be writing an adult gothic, or a ghost story, but even when I was writing them, Torak and Renn and Wolf didn\u2019t go away. They\u2019d pop into my head at odd moments, and that is very different to other books.\u201d On a trip to the Malangen fjord in northern Norway, she went out into the snow one night and the northern lights appeared: \u201cNot the massively lurid ones you see in documentaries, but it was like a twisted arrow or arch pointing north, and it gave me an idea. What if one of the trio leaves? And that\u2019s when the ideas started fizzing.\u201d Paver was in the middle of research for another adult novel \u2013 Wakenhyrst, about a lonely child growing up in the middle of the marshes in Edwardian Suffolk \u2013 so she had to put the germ of an idea for what would become Viper\u2019s Daughter aside. But she\u2019s no stranger to letting ideas percolate until they find their time: while studying biochemistry at Oxford in the late 70s, she found herself getting increasingly interested in writing and attempted a Mills &amp; Boon. \u201cIt was absolute rubbish. I was so arrogant. I had complete contempt for Mills &amp; Boon and thought it must be easy, so wrote it in three weeks and sent it in. Of course it got rejected.\u201d The next thing she wrote was set in Viking-age Norway about a boy, a wolf and a large bear. That got rejected, too \u2013 but 23 years later, while looking through her old manuscripts she realised there was something there. She shifted the story to the stone age and wrote Wolf Brother, the first book in the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness, which opens as Torak and his father are attacked by a demon bear. In the interim, she \u201ctook a bit of a wrong turn\u201d, becoming a biotechnological patents lawyer for 13 years. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m quite good at exams, why don\u2019t I do law for a couple of years and maybe I\u2019ll be published by then?\u2019\u201d After years of trying to write in the evenings and at weekends, and not really wanting to be a lawyer at all, she \u201chad to jump off the treadmill\u201d. She resigned without a book deal. During her six months\u2019 notice period, she landed one. \u201cMy earnings fell off a cliff. I went from six figures to earning less than a student teacher. But it was unbelievable how much it felt like the right thing. I didn\u2019t have to dress up in Armani trouser suits, I could just wear jeans.\u201d She was writing historical novels when her agent told her to consider other genres. That\u2019s when she came across her old manuscript. She wrote her agent a page-and-a-half, and he rang the next day to say \u201cdrop everything\u201d. She did, and worked solidly on the story for six weeks: Wolf Brother sold in a \u00a32m book deal. Paver takes her research seriously, getting to know the wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust, swimming with orcas, eating raw seal liver and whale blubber to better imagine how her characters would have experienced life. Torak\u2019s world is a long way from her home on Wimbledon Common, where she\u2019s currently writing the next two books in what will be a trilogy. She still starts out in longhand, before typing up her books on her 21-year-old computer, backing up on floppy disk and steering well clear of the internet and email. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a religion with me not to do email. I love the fact my computer is not accessible,\u201d she says. \u201cI know for lots of people that would be impossible for their work but at a time like this, I\u2019d be the same as everyone else, going on to 24-hour news and seeing what the latest on the coronavirus is.\u201d For Viper\u2019s Daughter, she went to Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off the coast of British Columbia, crawling into an ice cave under a glacier as she researched the climax of the novel, and to Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean, the last home of the woolly mammoth, flying to the far side of Siberia and taking an icebreaker to get there. (She\u2019s since curtailed travel, wanting to reduce her carbon footprint.) She had thought that mammoths had died before Torak\u2019s time, but discovered they\u2019d actually lingered on for a couple of thousand years more. Walking around Wrangel Island, watching out for polar bears, she was taken to see a mammoth tusk sticking out of the dried river bed. In the middle of a howling gale, a snowy owl hovered over her party. \u201cAll the time I was getting ideas for the story,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reason I do this research is that it makes readers of any age feel they\u2019re really there \u2013 eating blubber, smelling a fire, seeing the colour of a snowy owl\u2019s eyes, this strange, baleful yellow outlined in black, or the feel of knowing a polar bear is swimming near your boat. Research can sound like a boring word \u2013 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s going to teach children about the stone age\u2019 \u2013 but really, it\u2019s all in service of the story.\u201d Viper\u2019s Daughter by Michelle Paver is published by Head of Zeus (\u00a312.99). It is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a310.91."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
