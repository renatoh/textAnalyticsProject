She will be replaced by Paul Jackson, the Virgin Radio programme director, who did the job in an acting capacity before Ms Hazlitt's appointment in August 2005. Ms Hazlitt's departure comes as SMG is involved in talks over a potential merger with industry peer UTV, the owner of TalkSport. In the event of a merger, UTV may push for its radio chief, Scott Taunton, to head a combined radio operation. Ms Hazlitt was once tipped as a potential candidate for SMG chief executive, a vacancy that has not been filled since Andrew Flanagan's departure in July. The search process has been suspended while the UTV talks continue. \"I've had a fantastic time at Virgin Radio and I feel privileged to have been able to work with such talented people, but I have other things in my life that I want to achieve and it's time for me to move on,\" Ms Hazlitt said. \"I wish Paul and the whole team all the success they deserve.\" Ms Hazlitt joined SMG in August 2005 as chief executive of radio from Yahoo! UK and Ireland, where she was managing director. Mr Jackson has been Virgin Radio's programme director since 2001, and has been responsible for hiring presenters such as Christian O'Connell and Suggs. Donald Emslie, the SMG acting chief executive, said: \"She's been an inspirational leader for Virgin Radio and her knowledge of the radio and online world has taken the station to the next level,\" he said. \"This has provided Paul Jackson with a very strong platform from which to continue to develop the station.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
