Andrew Watson, Burnley's chief executive, made a point on Saturday of scotching rumours concerning the sale of Turf Moor but these are the sternest of economic times, with the 24 First Division clubs having been particularly hard hit by the collapse of ITV Digital. Last year, when Burnley were top of the table, albeit in a patently false position given the quality and strength of that squad, there was eager talk of Premiership football. The triangular constellation of Blackburn, Bolton and Burnley had twinkled brightly in the northern night skies before and if those other Bs could do it again, then why not Burnley as well? Such optimism, such covetous thoughts of Premiership gold being banked in their Pennine fastness, now seem mere illusion after Saturday's limp victory. The creditors are at the gates of all but a handful of the 72 Football League clubs, and the days of just muddling through appear numbered. A verbal indiscretion last season meant that Stan Ternent, the Burnley manager, was confined to the stands and, worse still, to the directors' box where, he observed, too many of the occupants believed they knew how to manage the team. This can hardly have come as a surprise, although the fact that this was Burnley's 10th match without defeat may have silenced most of the know-alls. Had Burnley not lost their opening four matches of the season, including a 3-1 home defeat by the now-bottom Brighton, they might have been close to the top again, although even given the absence of Dimitrios Papadopoulos and Gareth Taylor, on international duty, they looked a long way short of being promotion challengers. Walsall have saddled up players from Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Australia and Jamaica and had this united nation displayed a little more bite up front they could have seriously troubled Burnley. Much of Walsall's approach work was neat and inventive, and their promising 21-year-old Gary Birch should have headed a late equaliser, having previously scored his first League goal with 11 minutes remaining. Two lapses of defensive concentration cost Walsall dear, Robbie Blake scoring just before half-time and then Steve Davis, who had made Blake's goal, adding a second just as Walsall seemed on the verge of equalising. \"We didn't fold, but we only have a small squad,\" said their manager, Colin Lee. Better a small squad than no squad at all. Man of the match: Steve Davis (Burnley)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
