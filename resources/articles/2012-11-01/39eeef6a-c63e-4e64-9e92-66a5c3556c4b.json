Federer, who played magnificently on Sunday night after a slow start, won 7-6, 6-2 to rapturous applause and reaches for his seventh title in the Barclays ATP World Tour finals on Monday night against Novak Djokovic, the Serb having earlier accounted for Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in three absorbing sets. For all that the notion of Swiss neutrality is an historical clich\u00e9 \u2013 and those waving the Red Cross flag were proud and entitled to cheer for their representative \u2013 the noise throughout most of the packed arena seemed inordinately in favour of the world No2 against Murray for the hour and a half it lasted. Indeed, from this perch it would not be unreasonable to put it at 60-40. Two incidents stood out. After breaking Federer in the first game of the match Murray dropped serve to allow him back into the contest and, when deep in a fightback at 5-4, was heckled in mid-serve. He double-faulted but held and said later it did not affect the result, although it did prompt a plea from the umpire for silence. Then, towards the end of an enthralling tie-break, trailing 4-6, Murray changed rackets and a tiny section of the ground whistled and booed, an unedifying spectacle. At other moments minor errors were cheered, his better efforts sometimes only politely received. It was not the sort of homecoming an Olympic gold medallist and US Open champion might have expected in front of what was a largely British audience. While the Scot might have thought he could count on at least something like a fair shake against the most popular player of modern times, he declined to complain about any perceived slight. \"Almost all the times when you play Roger anywhere in the world he gets great support,\" he said. \"He deserves that because of everything that's he's achieved.\" He was similarly philosophical about the result, as well as the slight tailing off in his remarkable season. \"I don't think the results have been that bad,\" he said, of tight defeats in Tokyo, Shanghai and Paris, \"or that I played poorly or not responded well to winning the US Open. I would have liked to have finished with a win, obviously. But it's been the best year of my career by a mile. So it would be silly to look back on that negatively, because I've achieved things I've never achieved before.\" All that said, Federer played on a different level towards the end of the first set and most of the second. Once the rhythm of his tennis grew, he was pretty much irresistible and Murray's tennis did not survive a brutal examination in a clinical finish. The beast in Djokovic, meanwhile, has been stirred. Even as he was handing out chocolates to journalists after qualifying, one guessed the charity would end right there. The Christmas gift to his regular inquisitors was a nice gesture by a most interesting man but there will be no sentiment in the final. The Serb arrived in London from Paris understandably preoccupied by worries about his father's health but encouraging news on that front looks to have cleared his mind and he was back to near his ruthless best on Sunday afternoon, content, relaxed and dangerous. The reinstated world No1 will be tougher to beat on Monday night than he might have been a week ago. This was tennis which touched the heights, two uncompromising ball strikers leaving nothing but sweat on the court, stretching muscle and mind to the limit in a tense three-setter that lasted two hours and 11 minutes. Djokovic won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 pulling away. However, the Argentinian looked dominant in the first set and stayed on level terms until early in the second when, after a period of sloppy tennis, Djokovic came to life. The ball left his racket with more certainty, the near-misses of the first spell now clipped lines down the channels and deep, as the rush of a champion's desire coursed through him. \"I had a little, let's say, crisis from four-all in the first set to two-all in the second,\" he said, \"where I didn't feel so good on the court, struggling to find my momentum and my rhythm. Also, when mentally you're not confident and you're not in control of the match, your energy level drops. So I tried to be positive and push myself to fight for every point. I always believe I can come back.\" It should be some final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
