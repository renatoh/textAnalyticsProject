But the animals are making our isolation more enjoyable too. Exhibit A: the BBC sports commentator Andrew Cotter who, bereft of actual sports to commentate, has turned his attention to his two labradors: the older Olive and the younger Mabel. \u201cSo into the final minute and Olive in possession \u2013 but this is where Mabel is strong, chasing the game, using that intensity,\u201d Cotter begins, deadpan and calm, with that recognisable Scottish voice heard at Wimbledon, the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics. The dogs he films are engaged in a quiet power battle over an orange rubber bone that appears to have been in contention for some time. Olive holds strong for a while but then gets cocky, loosening her grip and positioning the toy up lengthways to give it a little lick. This turns out to be the moment of her downfall. With a steady intensity of focus \u2013 \u201cbuilt on patience and sheer belief\u201d \u2013 Mabel snatches it away, winning the title of \u201cvery good dog\u201d. Shared on Thursday night, the short clip was viewed more than 3m times in less than five hours \u2013 testament perhaps to a widespread craving for joy around the world. But the contest between these \u201cgreat rivals\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off: it\u2019s the second match in what we can only hope will be an ongoing series. The first game \u2013 an eating competition posted on 28 March, in which Olive (\u201cfocused, relentless, tasting absolutely nothing\u201d) reclaimed her title against the rising star \u2013 was viewed 9m times, retweeted by Ryan Reynolds and featured on ESPN. \u201cNone of this has changed Mabel or Olive,\u201d Cotter told the Telegraph in the wash-out from the first contest, \u201calthough a few friends have said Mabel was robbed, because I messed up getting her bowl down. There are demands for a rematch.\u201d \u201cIt just shows how much we are all missing sport and what we term \u2018normal life\u2019,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe absolutely take it for granted and we are at last realising that. I believe when sport returns, there will be a huge outpouring and it will not nearly be as cynical as before. Hopefully, that will be soon, as I am unemployed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
