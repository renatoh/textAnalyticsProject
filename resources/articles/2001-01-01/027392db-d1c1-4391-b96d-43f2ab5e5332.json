It is not only because he \"can't see us losing\" to Chelsea on Sunday; he knows that when Kent wakes up to a cold day this morning he will be in the sun. Having had 16 stitches removed from a wound big enough to keep his mobile phone in, the 35-year-old received an unexpected all-clear to join his squad in La Manga. With its pristine pitches and lush golf courses the Spanish resort seems a perfect place to prepare for the Cup holders' visit, provided the fire extinguishers are locked up. In fact Hessenthaler trusts his players not to follow in Stan Collymore's foamsteps and sounds undaunted by the thought of pitting his wits against Claudio Ranieri, who was in charge of Napoli when the late-developing midfielder was working on a building site in 1991. He did not book the trip to get a little continental coaching experience. \"Last week preparing for Crystal Palace we were outside one day and the rest had to be indoors because of the state of our training pitches with the weather we've had,\" he says, and the decision to go abroad looked all the wiser this week when Gypsies set up camp at the training ground. Limping round his office, Hessenthaler does not hide his disappointment at missing the Chelsea match, yet there is relief in his voice as well. He knows that the excruciatingly painful injury he sustained at Bournemouth in the previous round, which required two operations and had him still on 24 tablets a day this week, was close to ending his career. \"Luckily it was just as if someone had cut me with a razor blade,\" he says. \"If it had gone into the joint of the knee I would probably still be in hospital now and basically they said I would have had to pack up playing.\" Instead he can watch from the bench as his team try to avenge a 5-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in last season's quarter-final. Hessenthaler walked off that day clutching Didier Deschamps' shirt for his young Chelsea-supporting son, and 11 months on the then managers, Gianluca Vialli and Peter Taylor, have gone in very different directions. Hessenthaler has continued Taylor's good work since stepping up from player-coach in June. Gillingham are a creditable 14th in their first season in the First Division and hopeful of upsetting a side without an away win since April. \"I can't see us losing, I really can't,\" says Hessenthaler, who helped Watford knock the league champions Leeds out of the Coca-Cola Cup in 1992. \"We have gone seven games unbeaten, there's a lot of confidence in the team and we've got to exploit their away form. We're going to make sure our tempo is good from the start and stop them playing. \"If we let them dictate the game it could be very hard for us but if we make it into a bit of a battle I believe my players can do them. It's only a small ground which will be packed with 11,000 - we could have sold it three times over - and a few of their players have probably not experienced a place like Gillingham or even heard of Gillingham.\" Sheffield Wednesday and Bradford lost at Priestfield in the FA Cup last season, and although only a division divides Sunday's opponents the contrasts are enormous. Gillingham's record signing stands at \u00a3600,000, Chelsea's at \u00a315m; the \u00a32m Gillingham pay a year in wages must be topped by Chelsea every month. Hessenthaler may start without his leading scorer Carl Asaba, even though the striker's move to Crystal Palace fell through yesterday, and is banking on his good friend Taylor to help him along after Leicester's 2-0 win at Chelsea in September. \"We've spoken briefly,\" he says, \"and I'll be on the phone to Pete on Friday.\" Taylor signed him for Dartford and gave him his break into professional football when he was assistant manager at Watford in 1991. Hessenthaler took a wage cut to pursue that dream and now turns to Taylor for advice on tactics and dealing with players. Keeping up with Ranieri's changes of formation could be tricky but after those years running up and down ladders in the building trade, Hessenthaler knows how fortunate he is just to be part of Sunday's match. \"I do have to pinch myself sometimes,\" he says. \"If we had been sitting here 12 years ago and someone had said, 'You'll be managing Gillingham against Chelsea in the FA Cup,' I would have thought,no chance.\" Now, to the worry of his Chelsea-supporting son, he senses the best is yet to come. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
