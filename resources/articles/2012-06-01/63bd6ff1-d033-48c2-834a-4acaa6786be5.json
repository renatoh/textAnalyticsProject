When he visits the club to practise between tournaments, when the place is empty of all but the staff and office workers, he invariably takes time to sit alone with his thoughts in this centre of the game and wonder about what might have been and what is yet to come. \"I have spent a bit more time there in the last year than I normally would have,\" he says. \"It's very quiet. Sometimes I want to get out of the way and not be bothered, just do my own thing. I have sat on Centre Court with no one there and thought a bit about the court, the matches I have played there. \"If I had done that five or six years ago I would not really have known what I was looking at. It was just another court. But, when you have played so many matches, you have a lot of memories from that court. It means a lot to me. I want to make sure I feel as good as possible so I have a good tournament. \"I've done it many times for the last four or five months. When you sit down you think about all the matches you played, not just one\u2026 seems like a long time ago since the first time.\" It was seven years ago. Murray, not long turned 18, entered on a wild card, ranked 312, and in the first round beat the Swiss George Bastl (who had ended Pete Sampras's wondrous Wimbledon odyssey with a shock win five years earlier). Murray went out in the third round to David Nalbandian, the 2012 villain du jour, but his grand adventure was up and running. On Tuesday the fourth seed opens his campaign against the Russian Nikolay Davydenko, once No3 in the world, now lurking at 47 \u2013 not quite so dangerous, but not to be taken lightly either. Nobody is. Ask Sampras, who vowed to return after losing to Bastl but never did. Murray has reached the semi-finals three years in a row and the British public, fuelled by unquenchable musings on his chances, grow more restless by the year. It is inevitable as well as regrettable that not all the frenzy is positive. When Murray sits alone on Centre Court, he shuts out the negativity, the sniping off-stage about his attitude and all the other detritus of fame. \"I don't care about that any more \u2026 You have to be yourself \u2026 Everybody is different. Roger is completely different to Rafa, and he is completely different to Novak.\" Can he still enjoy his tennis, though, in such a hot house, the way he did when he was a kid in Dunblane? \"No,\" he concedes. \"It's something you reflect on after you have finished a match or a tournament. I've yet to see Rafa, Roger or Novak laughing in a semi or a final of a slam. People say I am not smiling on the court but I didn't see that once in the semis at the French. Winning is what you have to enjoy. You can laugh and joke with your team afterwards and it's time to celebrate. [During a match] you can enjoy specific shots or points that you play, when you play a great shot and win the point. But it is important when it's done you view the next one as just as important.\" Murray knows other British sportsman are even more harshly scrutinised. Wayne Rooney has been tweeting him messages of condolence and support from the European Championship, although they have never met. \"I think my brother met him in a nightclub somewhere,\" Murray says, \"because a few of the Manchester United players were in there. I don't know any footballers. The only one I have met is [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas. I haven't met any of the England players. You never know all the people that are watching you play at big events [but] you understand when you see [sporting celebrities] who have come along to watch big tennis events that it is such a global sport. I'm glad to be a part of it.\" He is even happier, sometimes, to be away from it, though \u2013 sitting by himself on Centre Court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
