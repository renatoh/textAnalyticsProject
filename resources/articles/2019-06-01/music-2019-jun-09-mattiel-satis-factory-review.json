But Mattiel Brown need fear no accusations of cookie-cutter insincerity. The genre she and the band that bears her name have chosen \u2013 punky garage rock with a Dirty Water Club-style vintage finish \u2013 attracts many a paper-thin stylist, but could they deploy the line \u201cyou want to submit it all for peer review\u201d with the aplomb Brown does on the irresistible strutting rockabilly of Rescue You? For all the Tarantino growl and spaghetti western shlock of opener Til the Moment of Death, this second album carries itself with more assurance than last year\u2019s eponymous debut, with songcraft and witty wordplay coming to the forefront. There\u2019s much here to love for fans of Holly Golightly and affiliates, or formative influences the White Stripes and the Black Lips. Yet Mattiel have mastered their own mischievous energy on the likes of Millionaire\u2019s narcotic bluesy balladry with deadpan backing vocals lifted from the Velvet Underground\u2019s Femme Fatale, the finger-clicks and semi-spoken Tom Tom Club vocal of Food for Thought, or the skittery-cymballed, funky Heck Fire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
