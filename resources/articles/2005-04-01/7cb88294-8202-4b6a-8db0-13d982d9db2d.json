The motivation of a European place should be enough to see off Aston Villa. David O'Leary's side have won four away games this season but all victories came against sides lower in the table at the time. Southampton to beat Norwich City in the Premiership 1pt at 23/20 (William Hill) Saints were appalling at Portsmouth last weekend but this is their last chance of survival and you can expect a fighting performance. Their chances will increase if Peter Crouch plays, but even without the lanky striker, they should have enough to see off a side without a single away win all season. Back Saints to claim the points. Birmingham City vs Blackburn Rovers draw in the Premiership 1pt at 9/4 (generally available) Only West Bromwich Albion have drawn more games in the Premiership than these two sides - 37% of all games involving Birmingham and Blackburn have finished all-square, whereas the odds suggest a 31% draw rate. Blues have drawn three of their last four outings while Blackburn have drawn their last two Premiership games - bet on shared honours again here. Preston North End vs Wigan Athletic draw in the Championship 1pt at 23/10 (William Hill) A draw would suit both sides here - a point would keep Preston firmly among the play-off places while the same result would consolidate Wigan's second place in the table. The visitors would do well to avoid defeat - Preston have lost only two games at Deepdale this season. As end-of-season nerves jangle a bet on honours shared is the value option. Cagliari to beat Reggina in Serie A 1pt at 7/4 (Totalbet, UK Betting) It's the silly time of year in Serie A when draws are priced at odds-on - the bookies fear that games between teams with little to play for will fizzle out into stalemates. The draw here, usually around 2/1, is actually odds-on - you should use that to your advantage by backing Cagliari, who have the best home record outside the top three (AC Milan, Juventus, Inter) and have lost just once in 16 games. Normally you'd expect to find Cagliari at around evens, so take the value price here. Auxerre to beat Toulouse in Ligue 1 1pt at 8/11 (generally available) Auxerre may have suffered a 3-0 reverse at home to Lyon last week but manager Guy Roux will refuse to let his side give up on their Uefa Cup chances. Auxerre are usually impressive at home against similar or weaker opponents and have an excellent chance to get back on track against a Toulouse side who have lost their last three matches and won just one in six."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
