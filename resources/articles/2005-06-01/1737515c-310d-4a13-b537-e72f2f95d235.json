If you didn't manage to commit to this festival fashion show in time, fear not. There's no reason to miss out on the beauty benefits of a couple of days spent in a muddy field, thanks to All Made Up's At Home Glasto Day Spa programme. Start with a clay cleanser (mud, clay, whatever, it's all muck), then move on to a good old-fashioned mud mask. Barielle's foot thingie gives the ultimate festival experience, except you get to rinse it off in a clean bathroom. Eating greasy noodles and swilling warm beer while doing all of this is, as ever, your call.
