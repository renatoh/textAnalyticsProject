Last year at the Labour conference he gave the speech of his life - a sweeping, messianic call for action in the face of global crisis that helped set in place a new political age. This year he once again looked beyond the Labour party conference in a speech that called for the renewal of that crusade but at times drowned in an avalanche of abstractions. A year on from the stark events of September 11, Mr Blair's language was troubled by uncertainties and his impact consequently less startling. The absolute confidence that so marked him last year at a time when world confidence seemed to have been blown away in New York has been replaced by sobre determination. Mr Blair still has no doubts about his purpose but he hedged this in with defences to convince a sceptical party and nation that his cause remains the right one. This was still the speech of a strong leader - but not a speech that will be remembered by historians, as last year's will. His opening jokes set the tone: he praised Europe's victory in the Ryder cup. \"Me and George Bush on different sides,\" he said - unexpected informality not seen from him in the same speech a year ago. The casual style was to set the tone for the words to come. So did the setting. Standing on a red podium that jutted out into a sea of delegates Mr Blair was presented as a leader among his people, not above them. For the first time since the mid-1980s, a Labour leader spoke with a backdrop that included real people, not images. The intention was to present him as an accessible persuader not a demi-god. It was a modern version of the soapbox. The opening message was relentlessly and simplistically internationalist. \"Our values aren't western values they are human values and anywhere they are given a chance they embrace them as their own,\" he said. But this year - unlike last - Mr Blair did not paint himself as the world's sole saviour but only as one of its many leaders, steeling himself for a difficult task that only the weak could consider shirking. One of the keywords was \"coalition\", and its repetition stressed his new approach. As in his speech to the TUC conference in the same hall three weeks ago, and his speech in the House of Commons last week, Mr Blair appealed to reason - not inspiration - carefully justifying his case. The ease with which he did this is a tribute to the prime minister's prowess: no other active politician shares his range, or the sense of political mood. He held back from absolute assertion, instead hesitating, explaining and justifying himself. The new caution shone through in his passage on anti-Americanism and in another praising the need for coalition. In part this change in tone came from the changed mood in Blackpool. The Labour party is still giving the prime minister the benefit of the doubt on Iraq, and - although less so - on the public services, despite the difficult headlines and troubles of yesterday's debates. But it also marked a change in the prime minister's own style. Some language reverted to the staccato simplicities of an earlier phase in his political career: \"Influence is power is prosperity\". \"We are at a crossroads. Party. Government. Country\". The prime minister seemed at times almost to be reassuring himself as well as his audience, defending his basic belief in the morality of interventionism and defending too his record in power. He also aped the themes that took Bill Clinton to power in 1992. Then, the US presidential candidate said he \"still believed in a place called hope\". \"I sometimes think the whole battle in politics can be reduced to a battle between pessimism and hope,\" Mr Blair said a decade later. He stressed, too, the power of individuals working in partnership: \"Out goes the 'big state'. In comes the 'enabling state'\". But that was given little meaning by passages on domestic policy that relied too much on boasts about the government's record. Strikingly, he hardly mentioned the opposition parties: a sign of how strongly Labour now dominates the political landscape. The prime minister's enemies are now issues such as crime - given three pages in his text, more than he gave to Iraq - and the public services, not with other political parties in the House of Commons. Nowhere in his long address did the prime minister reach the heights he has achieved in previous years with the same theme of action, renewal and leadership. \"Pessimism or hope. Despair or confidence. Decline or renewal. At our best when at our boldest,\" he concluded. Today Mr Blair was not at his best or boldest. But he stood before his party as a leader whose mastery of politics remains undiminished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
