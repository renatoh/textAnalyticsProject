The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has asked Australia to toughen its stance on Tehran and play a key role in a new \u201cglobal coalition\u201d against the regime. Tensions between the US and Iran are at their worst point since the White House pulled out of what the president said was an \u201cunfair\u201d nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action in May last year. Before the G20 summit in Osaka, Pompeo called on Australia to join what he described as a \u201cglobal coalition\u201d against Iran, which last week shot down a US surveillance drone. Iran has said the drone was in its airspace. But as the Trump administration escalates its sanctions and rhetoric, Pompeo said the US would welcome a move from Australia to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran. \u201cI think Australia is an important player here,\u201d he told the Australian. \u201cI think they carry a lot of weight in the sense that they, like many nations, suffer from the fact the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror continues down the path of building its missile program in a way that threatens not only the Middle East but the entire world. \u201cAustralia is an important economic player so the imposition of more autonomous sanctions would be welcomed as well.\u201d With the temperature rising, Morrison was asked by the ABC on Friday whether the US had sought or discussed the prospect of Australian involvement in military action when he met Trump and senior administration officials for dinner in Japan on Thursday night. Morrison said nothing had been sought but Australia was watching developments closely. \u201cThere are no requests and at this stage I think those issues are a bit premature but we are obviously concerned,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe will obviously work closely but any request like that will be dealt with in the normal way.\u201d Pressed on whether he would rule out Australian military support, Morrison said: \u201cWe would deal with any request from an ally such as the United States seriously and on its merits.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on Friday morning Australia had not decided to pursue further economic sanctions but they were under consideration. \u201cThe situation is troubling,\u201d he told ABC Radio. Birmingham said the government was continually looking at whether Australia\u2019s current sanctions were \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and was examining the \u201cadditional steps\u201d taken by the Trump administration. The US and Iran have edged closer to conflict after the downing of a Norwegian tanker and a Japanese tanker in the Gulf of Oman. The US has blamed Iran, which denies any involvement. Trump called off an airstrike against the country last week after the downing of the US drone, instead choosing to impose additional sanctions on Tehran. In a tweet, he threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d the Middle Eastern country. Britain, France and other European leaders, meanwhile, have been urging Tehran to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium at levels that would breach the the Obama-era nuclear deal. While the US has removed itself from the deal, other countries, including Australia and China, still support it and opposed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said on Thursday Trump\u2019s belief he could stage a \u201cshort war\u201d with Iran were wrong. In a tweet, he said: \u201cSanctions aren\u2019t alternative to war; they ARE war,\u201d adding: \u201c\u2018Obliteration\u2019=genocide=war crime. \u2018Short war\u2019 with Iran is an illusion. Whoever begins war will not be the one ending it. Negotiations and threats are mutually exclusive.\u201d Trump praised Morrison on Thursday for his election victory in May. Australia\u2019s focus at the G20 summit is trade and encouraging both the US and China to desist from their current dispute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
