Over the past month, BT has upped the amount it charges for its most basic line rental; it was immediately followed by its biggest competitor, Talk Talk. A previous Guardian Money favourite, the internet-based cheap calls provider, Call18866 sneaked through another price rise, while the Post Office has come to consumers' aid with a new \u00a350 cashback offer. Tesco has announced it is entering the \"voip\" voice over internet market. And if all that wasn't enough, the industry regulator has announced it is considering relaxing price controls \"before the end of the year\", which should bring call costs down even further. Ofcom's announcement was partly prompted by the recent takeover of OneTel and Tele2 by Talk Talk, the home-phone arm of Carphone Warehouse. The deal effectively created a company big enough - with 2.4m customers - to mount a serious challenge to BT. Such a move would mean BT would be freed from price restraints that have been in place since 1984, leaving the market to set prices. Most analysts are expecting a price war to be the likely outcome, with the consumer the most likely winner. That will all seem like a long way off for millions of BT's option one customers who now pay \u00a311 a month (up from \u00a310.50) for their line rental. Similarly, Call18866 customers who were being charged 3p for all domestic landline calls now find themselves paying 4p for the same unlimited call. So where is the smart money heading in the face of the shake-ups? If you really use your phone very infrequently, and don't make long calls when you do, the Post Office's deal is probably the best on offer at the moment. Sign up before March 31 and the Post Office will credit your account with \u00a350. Customers also enjoy a \u00a31-a-month saving over BT's line rental. Fans of Call18866 should simply switch to its sister company 1899.com. This works in exactly the same way - you dial 1899 before every call. This is still charging 3p for all domestic calls, although you have to question how long this will last given this company's record on putting up prices. However, anyone who uses their phone a considerable amount should switch to a company called Primus. It is offering free calls in the evenings and weekends for anyone agreeing to route all their other calls through it. Users keep their existing BT line and continue to pay the \u00a311 a month line rental. Call charges in the day are low (2p a minute - 4p minimum), but the free calls offer means most users will see their bills fall - to the extent moderate to heavy callers will save \u00a360 to \u00a3100 a year. You do need an email address to receive bills, but it does operate a call centre: dial 0800 036 0094 and ask for Saver Option Two. If you are thinking of also signing up for broadband, bear in mind that your provider may have a bundled package that also brings down the cost of calls. Tiscali broadband users can get all their landline calls for an extra \u00a35 a month - they pay \u00a319.99 for the internet package plus all the landline calls they can make. Lastly, is it worth considering the growing number of voice over internet (known as Voip) services? A number of big name firms including BT, Wanadoo and most recently Tesco have all launched Voip packages. Guardian Money has looked long and hard at them and despite all the headlines, we can't see that it makes sense for most phone users - unless they phone abroad a lot. The savings in domestic call charges are so minimal that they don't appear to justify the extra hassle, including going to your PC to make the call. International calls are only significantly cheaper if you're phoning outside Europe. Calls to UK mobiles can be cheaper. Each Tesco internet phone pack contains a phone handset, an installation CD, an installation guide and \u00a35 of free airtime, but costs \u00a319.97. Call charges are 2p a minute regardless of whether you call Bradford or Belgium. However, Primus customers calling the former during an evening pay nothing. Call18866 customers are charged 2p to all European destinations and even Iran is only 9p a minute. Tesco promises free calls between Voip customers, but so does Talk Talk, and a number of other providers. Families who spend all day talking to each other should collectively switch to such a firm. 3 offers payment for receiving calls Get paid to receive phone calls! That's the lure of a new service from mobile phone company 3 this week. But is it an offer that's too good to be true? The cashback deal is open to pay-as-you-go customers enabling those who receive, but make very few, calls to effectively operate a free phone. The new service called WePay rewards customers with a cash credit for all calls and texts they receive. Those signing up get a 5p credit for every full minute of a received call, and 2p per text, which they can claim each time they purchase a top-up voucher. The credit can then be used to purchase any 3 services, from texts and calls to buying music tracks and watching television. Critics of the company have suggested that the reason 3 has introduced the cashback option is as a way of offsetting its relatively high call charges. WePay users pay 30p a minute to call mobiles on rival tariffs, compared with the 15p charged by Tesco (Value SIM) or the Carphone Warehouse's Fresh service. 3's texts cost 10p each compared to the others' 5p. Anthony Ball, of mobile phone tariff comparison website One Compare.com says: \"It seems to be targeted as a way of pushing mobile users into the 3G world of video and games. They are essentially offering free usage of the more advanced features that the 3 network is capable of (television clips etc) that customers might not have wanted to pay to try otherwise. For trying out the services, it's great - but it's a matter of whether you carry on using them that matters to 3.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
