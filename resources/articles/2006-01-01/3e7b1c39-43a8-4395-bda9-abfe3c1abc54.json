Which? said the schemes were \"expensive, inflexible and leave homeowners with little or no equity in the property, severely limiting choices later in life\". The group added that they were \"high-risk products\" which should only be used as a last resort. Two types of scheme exist: equity release mortgages, most of which offer borrowers the chance to roll up their interest payments, and reversion schemes which allow them to sell all or part of their home but continue to live there. The Which? report focused on roll-up mortgages and calculated that someone borrowing \u00a380,000 through a typical scheme could end up owing \u00a3256,570 to the lender after 20 years. This sum would have to be paid back through the proceeds of the sale of the house. Which? said the way some of the products were advertised was irresponsible, citing promotional material from Norwich Union which suggested spending the money on a trip to New York or \"something for the family\". And it pointed out that someone who took a minimum loan from Norwich Union of \u00a315,000 would owe around \u00a328,000 after 10 years. \"Lenders want to sell you a lifestyle dream, but the reality can be very different,\" said Which? magazine's editor, Malcolm Coles. \"These schemes could turn into a financial nightmare which can stay with you the rest of your life.\" But Jon King, chairman of Safe Home Income Plans (Ship), a professional organisation representing 18 equity release providers, said the alternatives suggested by Which? - downsizing or borrowing money from family members - would not suit everyone. \"Borrowing from family and friends and downsizing may not always be the easy option that Which? implies it is. \"Which? does not appear to have considered the emotional attachment that clients may have to their home and the way that equity release can help them stay there if they wish without having to sacrifice their lifestyle. \"Equity release also reduces the value of an estate for inheritance tax purposes - an increasing concern for many UK homeowners whose main asset may already exceed the IHT thresholds.\" Mr King said Which? had failed to mention the part played by Ship in the industry, or the Ship code which offers consumers certain guarantees about schemes, including a promise that they will never owe more than their property is worth. \"Ship recognises that equity release deals with a potentially vulnerable class of consumer and would always advise clients to look at all viable options before taking out an equity release scheme,\" he added. \"However, we would stress that equity release is not just an option of last resort but can allow many people to enhance their lifestyles post-retirement by capitalising on their main asset.\" Phil Veale of the financial services arm of the charity Age Concern, which offers an equity release scheme from lender Northern Rock, said he agreed with Which? that alternatives should be considered but pointed out that many poorer homeowners did not have a choice. \"The report does not, in our view, fully take on board the benefits of most equity release schemes for less well off older homeowners needing to supplement low incomes or pensions,\" he said. Equity release mortgages are regulated by the City watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA); legislation to bring reversion schemes under the FSA's jurisdiction is currently going through parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
