At 8pm tonight the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup kicks off in Paris with an opener between hosts France and South Korea. The month-long tournament that follows will be a kind of test of whether footballing equality \u2013 or something approaching it \u2013 can ever happen for women. The teams taking part in the competition know what they have to do: win a football match, and then keep winning matches until they lift a trophy at the final on 7 July. But the rest of us are also being watched. The real answer to whether women\u2019s football can ever advance beyond minority-sport status lies with the spectators. Until now, not enough people have watched women\u2019s football \u2013 or even cared that it exists. The top players don\u2019t yet have the celebrity of their male counterparts, and there remains a somewhat unfair prejudice that the women\u2019s game is inherently less enjoyable. (Come on, it\u2019s at least 47 years since the FA graciously lifted its ban on women\u2019s football!) Will anything have changed at the end of this tournament? I truly hope so: a newfound appreciation for women\u2019s football would be an even greater turnaround than the deification last year of Gareth Southgate for his feats in charge of the England men\u2019s team. If mass audiences do start to watch women playing top-flight football, the rest \u2013 equitable sponsorship, packed stadiums, decent player salaries, not asking the world\u2019s best forward to twerk \u2013 may follow. Viewers might even discover they prefer it to the men\u2019s game. There is less diving, faking and arguing with the ref. It is perceived as being more accessible, according to the European Club Association, \u201cbecause women players tend to behave in a more genuine way\u201d. One of the major problems women\u2019s football (in Britain and beyond) faces is exposure \u2013 but not this month. Tonight\u2019s opening game, and all the subsequent matches, have primetime coverage on BBC One. The last major event in the sport\u2019s calendar \u2013 the daftly named SheBelieves Cup, a four-team tournament held in the US in February \u2013 had half-empty stands, a rather drab atmosphere and was shown after 10pm on BBC Four. (England won, in case you missed it.) Exposure on the main channel, a decent line-up of pundits \u2013 ex-England defender Alex Scott is among the best \u2013 and a European time zone for all the matches should maximise eyeballs here. And yet, where is all the publicity that should be supporting the terrestrial coverage? Yes, it\u2019s great that the woman-led Offside Rule podcast will be doing daily reports, but over on the newspaper back pages and main sports bulletins it\u2019s hardly wall-to-wall hype and pap shots of off-duty players. For those who already follow the sport, today is a real moment of hope and determination that 2019 might mark the start of a new era. Next year the Tokyo Olympics will showcase women\u2019s football (Japan, ranked seventh in the world, is the toughest competitor in England\u2019s group D). And in 2021 the Uefa Women\u2019s Euros are set to be hosted in England. By then, we might know if the great women\u2019s football experiment will ever succeed here or not. It all comes down to fandom. The World Cup could be the best chance yet for female footballers \u2013 but also specifically England\u2019s Lionesses and Scotland \u2013 to gain home support. The top domestic league, the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL), is now fully professional. Five or six years ago the best players were paid almost nothing, forcing them to take second jobs. Tales of players paying for their physio and travel were not uncommon. The best talent emigrated to the US college system, which is still one of the most lucrative destinations for an upcoming female footballer. (This month the youngest ever pro soccer player, Olivia Moultrie, was signed to the Portland Thorns, at the age of 13. Premiership academies sign boys at nine.) It doesn\u2019t really help matters to make comparisons with the Premier League. Today, women\u2019s salaries barely match H\u00e9ctor Bellerin\u2019s monthly wardrobe allowance (WSL pay is around \u00a325,000 per annum, roughly doubled with an England salary). Media coverage and sponsorship in the WSL is patchy. But young female talent has strengthened, with some of the finest England players \u2013 look out for star defender and vice-captain Lucy Bronze and 25-year-old forward Nikita Parris \u2013 transferring to Olympique Lyonnais, the world\u2019s best women\u2019s team. (Earlier this year, in the course of researching a profile I wrote about Bronze, I kept count of who, out of various football-loving friends and acquaintances, had heard of her: there was a generational divide, with her 11-year-old-boy fanbase surprisingly strong.) England\u2019s current strength is one of the most compelling reasons to believe that the sport could at last gain support here, the birth nation of football. The Lionesses are now ranked third in the world. Manager Phil Neville, who took over in 2017 after the ignominious sacking of Mark Sampson, has made himself popular with his players, proving that professional management experience (he didn\u2019t have much) can sometimes matter less than empathy, years of actually playing the game and sheer energy. He will know, as his players do, that success at this World Cup would bring more than a trophy home. It would inject the oxygen of publicity and popularity into a sport which has flagged over recent decades, as funding, sponsorship and crowd numbers fluctuated. England have a good chance of going deep into the competition, hopefully bringing along with them a watching nation who might be willing to give this burgeoning sport a shot. Let\u2019s see how we all do. \u2022 Susie Rushton is a writer, editor and sports fan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
