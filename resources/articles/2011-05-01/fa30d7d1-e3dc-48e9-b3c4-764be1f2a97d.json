People, he said, would be going to supermarkets to stock up on food and drink, and this would be good for the \"hard-hit retail sector\". What I fail to understand is, if sitting in front of the telly getting bladdered and shoving kettle chips down our gullets is so good for the economy, why don't we all do it all the time? I decided to take his advice anyway, hoping the general principle would hold true even if it were not the wedding I was watching. Problem was, the family wanted to watch it, so I caught bits, before my furious flipping drove them from the room. It is not the royal family per se that I object to \u2013 although I do not think they are anywhere near as funny as they used to be \u2013 but the never-ending torrent of forelock-tugging gush from the likes of Huw Edwards. The wedding, said Huw, \"makes a powerful statement\", something about Kate bringing a \"refreshing informality\" (copyright: all newspapers, radio, TV) to the old firm. Like most commentators, Huw, who had had his brain removed for the day \u2013 I think it's the law \u2013 and replaced with a clockwork mouse channelling the thoughts of the late Barbara Cartland, marvelled at the marvellousness of everything. As Kate was driven through Admiralty Arch, he noted approvingly: \"Through the narrow arch, safely negotiated.\" Blimey. I live near a private school where most of the mums turn up in 4x4 vehicles to collect their precious ones, and seem about as familiar with the width of their cars as they are with the cut-price offers at Iceland, and even 20 or 25% of them, I wager, could drive through Admiralty Arch. I shall tell you what is a difficult skill: piloting one ton of rampaging water buffalo in a race over 110 metres at speeds of up to 50 kilometres an hour. That is what I was watching Dan Yansri do in Thailand's Chonburi province at the very moment vows were being exchanged at the abbey \u2013 which I felt was making a pretty powerful statement in itself (although not quite as powerful as Wakefield's refuse collectors, who were emptying my wheelie bin during the ceremony. Good work, chaps). The buffalo race is a tradition going back 140 years. In the 1870s, when Chonburi was the trading capital of the eastern seaboard, farmers would use the beasts of burden to transport their goods to market, arguments ensued about who had the best buffalo, and the annual race stemmed from that. The province, 70 kilometres south of Bangkok, is also home to countless wild monkeys. Yes, I have been watching Transworld Sport. I love Transworld Sport because it reminds me of the entirely random short films that used to accompany the main feature at the cinema. You would turn up for the latest Carry On or Bond movie, and find yourself watching a 25-minute short about laying pipelines in the Philippines. I got the impression that the buffalo race is every bit as important a tradition in Chonburi as dressing up and talking tosh about the royal family is here. \"For us farmers round here, it's the main sport,\" (they don't get Channel 4 there, so they have to make their own fun), said jockey Sumit Puamkhun. \"We sometimes even have buffalo races back on our farms.\" On the Extreme Sports channel, meanwhile, (my family have tried hiding the remote) there were several episodes of Mantracker to divert those of us not buying into the nationalfestival of sycophancy, but without any bin-emptying to occupy us. Mantracker is a reality show where two people are released into the wilds of the Yukon, and two expert trackers on horseback hunt them down. \"The Yukon is one hostile territory,\" went the narration, \"slippery slopes, ice-cold glacial lakes, valley floors that snag both foot and hoof, and very few branches of Starbucks.\" (I may have made the Starbucks thing up, but the wilderness does seem to be suspiciously near roads and traffic). The most politically incorrect TV I have ever watched \u2013 including any comedy show from the 70s you care to mention \u2013 was on Mantracker, when two black guys running through the woods were being chased by two grizzled white rednecks \u2013 with ropes, for goodness sake \u2013 on horseback. The cultural resonances seemed to have been entirely missed by the production team. It was one of those things you watch open-mouthed, like the front row in Mel Brooks's The Producers. On royal wedding day, though, they were hunting down an estate agent (what is not to like?) and a woman described as \"a maverick chicken farmer\". Was it the chickens that were slightly off the wall, I wondered, or their custodian? It seemed to me a more interesting question than the colour of the Queen's hat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
