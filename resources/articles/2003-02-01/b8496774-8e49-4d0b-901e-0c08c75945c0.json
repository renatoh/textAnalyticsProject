Even more worrying, Nasser's not playing. But fear not, he hasn't come home in a huff, he's just got a stiff neck. Irani's come in as a replacement, but apart from that it's the same team which humbled Holland. Trescothick gets off the mark unconvincingly with an edge down to third man, off Snyman's medium pace. 2nd over: England 1-0 (Trescothick 1, Knight 0) More dodgy fiddling around from Tresco, who can't believe how slowly van Vuuren is bowling. He literally plays two shots to the first ball, the second of which produces an edge off the back of his bat which just fails to carry to van Schoor, behind the stumps. 3rd over: England 12-0 (Trescothick 12, Knight 5) After a couple of dodgy overs, Trescothick seems to have found his range, cover driving Snyman for four. The Namibian seamer is a bit riled by this, and throws in a bouncer next ball, which Tresco hooks for six. A bit more like it, Marcus. 4th over: England 18-0 (Trescothick 12, Knight 5) Uma Venkatraman, in Singapore, writes in to ask if we're providing over-by-over updates for the India-Zimbabwe match? The simple answer is no, though I'll attempt to keep you posted. \"How do you expect me to survive at work without your pithy comments? The England-Namibia match result should be a foregone conclusion. India's match is a make-or-break affair.\" Have you seen England recently, Uma? Knight gets in on the act and cracks a four through the covers. 5th over: England 25-0 (Trescothick 17, Knight 6) India have started well against Zimbabwe, racing to 32-0 off five overs. Andy Flower took to the field with a black wristband. He wore a black armband in the team's opening game in protest against Robert Mugabe's government but was asked to stop wearing it by the cricket authorities. Back in Port Elizabeth, England are progressing nicely, and Trescothick is starting to time the ball nicely, playing a beautiful straight drive to the ropes. 6th over: Wicket!!! England 26-1 (Trescothick 17, Vaughan 1) Oh dear. Knight attempts a bit of a flashy pull from van Vuuren, but catches it high on the bat from where it flies to Burger at cover, who gobbles it up with relish (get it?). Maybe we should have covered the India game after all... 7th over: England 37-1 (Trescothick 17, Vaughan 11) Vaughan appears untroubled by Knight's early departure, and cuts a sway through the Namibian fielders, playing a glorious cover drive, followed by a lazy pull, both of which speed to the boundary. Incidentally Uma, the very latest from Harare sees your boys at 82-0 off 12 overs. Tendulkar and Sehwag are opening, a decision which looks like it's paying off. 8th over: England 39-1 (Trescothick 18, Vaughan 12) \"Perhaps it's a bit early to be asking if there's something better on, but any chance of over-by-overs on the India/Zimbabwe or, more importantly, Sri Lanka v. Canada?\" enquires James Keirstead. No problem, James, I'll just flick between the three games and provide an incisive analysis of each, simultaneously, shall I? Tell you what, I'll have that conference call with Hans Blix, George Bush and Saddam Hussein while I'm at it and sort out that nonsense. Or I could just tell you that India are 82-0 off 14 overs, with Tendulkar and Sehwag opening, a decision which looks like it's paying off. Canada, meanwhile, are struggling just a bit against Sri Lanka, at 11-3. 9th over: England 43-1 (Trescothick 19, Vaughan 14) Not much happening in Port Elizabeth. Maybe we should move to the Sri Lanka/Canada clash after all... 10th over: WICKET!!! England 43-2 (Trescothick 19, Stewart 0) Sensible batsmen learn from others' mistakes, how the pitch is playing, how the bowler's bowling, that sort of thing. I've always had Vaughan down as pretty sensible, until now. Remember how I told you a few overs back that Knight tried a bit of a flashy pull from van Vuuren, but caught it high on the bat from where it flew to Burger at cover, who gobbled it up with relish? Well exactly the same's happened here, with Vaughan the culprit. 11th over: England 46-2 (Trescothick 20, Stewart 0) Burger, fresh from his two catches, has been rewarded by being given a bowl. He trundles up and sends down a few gentle medium pacers. Tendulkar's out, and India are 99-1 off 16. Canada, would you believe, are 12-6. And that's not a misprint. 12th over: England 47-2 (Trescothick 21, Stewart 2) Stewart, who's taken over as skipper in Nasser's absence, is off the mark, and, in light of the West Indies' frustrations yesterday, John Walsh thinks he's spotted an innovative tactic from The Gaffer. \"It seems clear that England are going to get themselves bowled out for about 120 so they will have time to get the Namibians out before the rain comes. Excellent thinking.\" 13th over: England 48-2 (Trescothick 22, Stewart 2) Just one off the over, making it a whopping 11 off the last 6. On the subject of Canada (who have now steamed on to 21-6), I recall one team we used to play during my schooldays, who were so bad that we always had to bat first, just so the game wouldn't be over in half-an-hour. I seem to recall we racked up about 200-odd against them, before bowling them out for four. Chopper West got a century. I'll stop now, I'm getting a bit nostalgic. 14th over: England 56-2 (Trescothick 26, Stewart 2) Trescothick looks to get on with it, and finds a couple of gaps through which to sneak two leg-side clips to the boundary. Just as well he did find gaps, as both shots were a bit uppish. 15th over: England 59-2 (Trescothick 26, Stewart 5) Sean Carless writes in to ask if he is right in presuming the Namibian team is made up of lads of Afrikaan descent, \"or is there some ethnic diversity?\" Phil Jeffery is a little more succinct: \"As Namibia are an African country, how many black players are there in their team?\" The answer is that most Namibian players are of Akrikaans extraction, so there are few players 'of colour' (I think I can say that). However, this is not necessarily a reflection of any prejudicial selection policy on the Namibian selectors behalf, since most of the players in the country are probably ex-pat Dutch, judging by their names. I think Namibia is an ex-Dutch colony. I imagine the situation, in terms of the profile of the country's cricketers, is not unlike that of Zimbabwe. 16th over: England 64-2 (Trescothick 33, Stewart 6) I was misled on the India/Zimbabwe front. Tendulkar's not out, Sehwag is. In fact Sachin is smashing the ball to all sides of the park, and is currently on 65, with India 117-1 off 20. Canada's mighty eighth wicket stand has finally come to an end, alas, and they're 24-7. 17th over: England 69-2 (Trescothick 37, Stewart 7) Trescothick has not entirely convinced in his innings so far, but he's still there, approaching 40, and cracks a four through the covers. Stewart's also approaching 40, and looking every year of it in this heat. 18th over: England 80-2 (Trescothick 38, Stewart 16) As if riled by my gentle jape, Stewart plays a trademark pull (you know, that one where he cocks his leg a little) over the infield for four, his first boundary of the innings. He then follows this up with a front-foot drive back past the bowler for four more. Well played Alec. 19th over: England 89-2 (Trescothick 42, Stewart 23) Tresco forces back the field with some pinch-hitting. Niall, in Munick, claims I'm 'wrong again', in saying Namibia is an ex-Dutch colony, when it is, in fact, an ex-German colony. Thus I'm grateful to John Bains, who's provided this potted history of Namibia: Spaniards were in in 1484 Dutch in 1793 Germans in 1884 British in 1915 Ongoing \"problems\" with South Africa from 1960 Independent in 1990 Population 1.6 million 6.6% white 7.4% mixed race 86% black So not entirely wrong, eh Niall? 20th over: England 93-2 (Trescothick 43, Stewart 23) The skipper, Deon Kotze, has brought himself on, bowling leg-spin. 21st over: England 97-2 (Trescothick 46, Stewart 27) Berger is bowling from the Duck Pond End, which gives you some idea of the scale of this ground. 22nd over: England 101-2 (Trescothick 49, Stewart 28) We now have scorecards for the Canada (36 all out) and India (142-2) games on the front page of the sport site, so I'm going to concentrate exclusively on this game from hereon (apart from when it gets a bit dull, and there's a colonial/ethnic debate to be had). Unfortunately, our England scorecard isn't working yet, so you'll have to make do with this commentary instead. 23rd over: England 109-2 (Trescothick 50, Stewart 34) That's fifty for Trescothick. Not the most authoratative of half-centuries, but he's battled through well. Stewart's starting to enjoy himself too, and tucks into Burger, carting him over the top 24th over: England 113-2 (Trescothick 50, Stewart 34) Adam Aldridge asks about England's decision to bat first, given the poor weather forecast. An easy query to field that one, since it was in fact Namibia's decision. They won the toss and put England in. 25th over: Wicket!!! England 124-3 (Stewart 39, Collingwood 3) Jan-Berry Burger comes on to replace Louis Burger. Bowling leg-spin, he sends down a full-toss, which Trescothick swats for four, then an innocuous straight one, which also goes to the boundary. Trescothick's eyes light up when he sees another full-toss on its way, but, trying a sweep that's not on, he gets a top edge, which flies straight to Louis Burger, at leg gulley. Tresco's gone for 58, caught Burger, bowled Burger. A double burger you could say. In fact Louis Burger has now taken three catches, making it a triple Bur.... oh OK, I'll move on... 26th over: England 125-3 (Stewart 39, Collingwood 4) England regroup after Tresco's calamity. 27th over: England 137-3 (Stewart 44, Collingwood 9) The gaffer's enjoying himself out there. You get the feeling he's revelling in the responsibility, not just of stepping in for the stricken Nasser, but also of steadying England's ship after the first three batsmen threw themselves overboard. He's carted another boundary off Burger, who's erratic, to say the least. 28th over: England 139-3 (Stewart 45, Collingwood 10) You're not going to believe this - there's a bowling change. And who's coming on? Yep, it's Burger, the third. This is Sarel Burger, Louis's brother. Apparently he's a quantity surveyor. Not much quantity for him to survey in that over, just a couple of quick singles. 29th over: England 143-3 (Stewart 46, Collingwood 12) I'm being beseiged by emails asking me to point out that, in the temporary absence of our scoreboard facility, the anoraks can get a ball-by-ball scoreboard on various rival sites. Which may be true, but you don't get the pithy comments on the likes of bbc.co.uk. I mean, \"A forward defensive from Collingwood\" - where's the fun in that? Crazy guys, those BBC lot. 30th over: England 152-3 (Stewart 53, Collingwood 14) I've been reliably informed that the scoreboard is now working. So there. Stewart's got his fifty, and brings it up in style, swatting the bowler (no doubt one or other of the various Burgers on offer) over the top for six. 31st over: England 155-3 (Stewart 56, Collingwood 14) 32nd over: WICKET!!! England 161-4 (Collingwood 19, Flintoff 0) Just as Stewart was threatening to cut loose, smacking another four, this time off the back foot, he perishes. It must be said that the gaffer has gone down in flames, though, sweeping high down to deep square, but that will only annoy him further. He's gone for 60, and all four dismissed batsmen have been caught in the outfield, most of them playing pretty loose shots. 33rd over: England 166-4 (Collingwood 20, Flintoff 2) Flintoff has just played the most studious forward defensive ever, holding his text-book position for a good few seconds after connecting. I'm sure they'll be getting excited over at bbc.co.uk 34th over: England 168-4 (Collingwood 21, Flintoff 3) The Namibian fans are getting pretty boisterous out there, and why not? On the pitch, Collingwood gets all tied up trying to fend off Burger's nagging leg-spin, and dollies one up off bat/pad which falls just short of the sprawling keeper. 35th over: England 173-4 (Collingwood 26, Flintoff 3) All these spinners and gentle medium pacers are playing havoc with my rythm. I can't even remember how to spell rhythm. I think that's right. The trouble is, the overs are going so quickly that there's no time to consult the dictionary, or, indeed throw in any of your witty, disparaging comments. Let alone mine... 36th over: England 183-4 (Collingwood 28, Flintoff 11) Freddie Flintoff's cutting loose, and heaves a huge six straight down the ground, to the delight of the locals. 37th over: England 183-4 (Collingwood 28, Flintoff 11) Geoff Arnold writes in with an interesting point: \"Can you declare in a one dayer? And if so has anyone ever done so? Say you were put in to bat and knew that a storm was forecast for 4 hours hence, and you needed the points, what do you do?\" It's a fair point, and you wonder what Sri Lanka would have done had that been the case against Canada today... Meanwhile, some bookies are offering a special Fat Freddie v The Burgers wager, says Simon Guild. Flintoff needs to score more runs, and take more wickets and catches than Namibia's combined Burgers. 38th over: England 186-4 (Collingwood 31, Flintoff 13) Burger's been taken out of the attack, which will surely affect the bookies' odds. I wonder if the skipper told him to Burger off... 39th over: England 192-4 (Collingwood 34, Flintoff 13) England are racking up the runs, and it looks like Burger and his Namibians will be looking at a bit of catchup. It could make for a feast of cricket though... 40th over: England 202-4 (Collingwood 38, Flintoff 20) Flintoff hadn't scored a run for four overs, and then goes and swats a MASSIVE six over long on to bring up the 200. 41st over: WICKET!!! AND ANOTHER ONE!!!! England 205-6 (Blackwell 1, White 0) Facing Snyman, Collingwood tries to put his foot on the gas, but succeeds only in picking out extra-cover, and a fifth England batsman has gone, caught in the outfield for 38. Then would you believe it, Flintoff fails to read a slower ball, is on the stroke way to early, and spoons one up to the same fielder, who takes it with glee. Freddie's gone for 21 and England aren't making it easy. 42nd over: England 209-6 (Blackwell 5, White 2) White takes an ambitious second run down to third man, and gets home by the skin of his teeth. 43rd over: England 220-6 (Blackwell 8, White 7) White gets a leading edge, but the dodgy Burger can't claim the catch. He'll be grilled about that later. On the subject of declaring in a one-day game, Mark from Moscow recalls how Somerset once declared at 0 for 0 after 1 ball in a B&amp;H game to ensure that their opponents, Worcestshire, couldn't overtake them on run rate. The practice has since been outlawed, says our man in the know, Lawrence Booth. 44th over: WICKET!!! BUT IT'S DISALLOWED!!! England 227-6 (Blackwell 13, White 9) Louis Burger is brought back to beef up the bowling attack, and draws a false stroke from White, who dollies it straight to square leg. Just as the Namibians are celebrating, though, the umpire signals a no-ball, since they only had three (and not four) fielders in the circle. 45th over: England 232-6 (Blackwell 14, White 13) England are grinding on, happy to pick up singles, which the Namibians, employing a defensive field, are seemingly happy to give them. 46th over: England 237-6 (Blackwell 16, White 16) They're not exactly making mincemeat out of Burger, more making a meal of it, but the England all-rounders are at least pushing on to a halfway respectable total. 47th over: WICKET!!! England 246-7 (White 24, Irani 1) Blackwell looks to slog through mid-wicket, gives himself room, opens up the face, and nicks it to the keeper. He's gone for 16. 48th over: England 255-7 (White 29, Irani 5) Van Vuuren's back, thank God, so the puntastic commentary gives way to a more sober analysis. I've been inundated with emails, too many to mention individually, so here's a summary of your thoughts: England have battled stubbornly to a total which should be more than enough (Namibia were all out for 84 against Pakistan) but their batting remains far from convincing. That said, quite a few of you notice how some of the major Test-playing nations are being undone by trundling bowlers from non-Test playing teams, who don't come onto the bat as quickly as the more established bowlers. In which case, expect Freddie Flintoff and Ronnie Irani to have a field day, so to speak. 49th over: England 262-7 (White 33, Irani 8) The England boys are having a bit of fun throwing the bat out there, and with Namibia posting several fielders on the boundary, it makes for a decent spectacle (if, like us, you're not a purist). White nearly succumbs here, picking out Jan-Berry Burger at long on, who spills it. 50th over: SLOG!!! WICKET!!! SLOG!!! WICKET!!!! SLOG!!! WICKET!!!! England 272 all out A typically farcical final over. White eventually gets his comeuppance, heaving Van Vuuren to long-on, where the catch is safely taken. Irani then swats a four, before going for a six, which he skies to extra cover. Caddick comes in, deftly sweeps a boundary, and then goes for the big one off the final ball, which goes straight through to rattle the furniture. Van Vuuren has five wickets, and looks chuffed with his haul. He has now represented his country in two World Cups. Nothing special about that, you may think, until I tell you that the other was the Rugby World Cup..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
