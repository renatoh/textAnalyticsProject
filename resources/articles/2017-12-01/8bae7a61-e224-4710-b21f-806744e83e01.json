If it does not feel quite as homely as Nottingham or Manchester, Melbourne has been the site of many great English moments \u2013 as well as, inevitably, a few grisly nightmares. Perhaps the greatest of those 55 Tests, and surely the most thrilling, came in 1982, with England 2-0 down after three matches but the destination of the urn still undecided. It was, the England spinner Geoff Miller said, \u201cthe best and most exciting Test match I ever played in\u201d. Australia\u2019s final pair, Allan Border and Jeff Thomson, needed 74 runs to win the match and with it the Ashes. England\u2019s tactic was simple: offer Border easy singles and wait for Thomson to get himself out. \u201cThere was no pressure on me,\u201d Thomson would later tell Cricinfo. \u201cEveryone expected me to play a stupid shot and get out. But it didn\u2019t happen that way. I can still picture the England side\u2019s growing anxiety. They had stupid fields, bowled badly and everything was in the batsmen\u2019s favour.\u201d Slowly, the target got closer; England took the new ball with Australia 33 runs from victory, but still the wicket they needed would not come. Eventually, Australia needed four more runs to claim victory. Thomson was on strike, and Ian Botham bowling. \u201cI thought I would get a single, so AB could hit the winning runs,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cIt was a half-tracker and a bit of an away swinger. A bad ball really. I just tried to push it out for a single rather than smash it.\u201d It caught his edge and flew to Chris Tavar\u00e9 at second slip. He could not hold it but the ball popped up behind and Miller caught it at first slip. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk about it for years,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cIt was one of the all\u2011time low moments in my life.\u201d That match still sits joint-third on the list of closest Test finishes, of which nine of the top 15 came in Ashes contests. The 1998 MCG Test is at No13, another slender England victory \u2013 by 13 runs \u2013 memorable for Alec Stewart\u2019s first Ashes century, Mike Atherton\u2019s first Test pair and a classic last-innings collapse by Australia. Set an eminently achievable target of 175 the home side fell from 130 for three to 140 for seven and 162 all out with Dean Headley achieving career\u2011best figures of six for 60, his only Test five-for. The finest English bowling performance in Melbourne, however, came in 1954-55 when Frank \u201cTyphoon\u201d Tyson, described by Don Bradman as \u201cthe fastest bowler I have ever seen\u201d, finished the match with a spell of six for 16 in 6.3 eight-ball overs to tilt the series in England\u2019s favour. The Guardian\u2019s Denys Rowbotham wrote that this was a victory \u201cso violent and unexpected \u2026 that three hours after its accomplishment the mind and senses have not quite recovered from the shock of it\u201d. Brian Statham took five wickets in the first innings and Rowbotham noted: \u201cThe speed of both bowlers was simply too much for the Australian batsmen\u2019s techniques,\u201d a now unlikely sounding occurrence that they have avenged many times since. In March 1977, the MCG hosted a special one\u2011off match to celebrate the centenary of the first ever Test. The victors, Australia, were the same in each match. Much more remarkably, England\u2019s margin of defeat in both games was 45 runs. There was some drama along the way, though: Australia were skittled out for 138 on the first day, with the opener Rick McCosker\u2019s dismissal particularly unusual: he mistimed a hook and was hit in the face by a Bob Willis bouncer, which not only broke his jaw but the ball also dropped on to his stumps. Richie Benaud opined: \u201cThere has never been a more disastrous day for Australian cricket in the 100 years the game has been fought between the two countries,\u201d but the following morning Dennis Lillee took six wickets as England were bowled out for 95. In the second innings three Australians scored fifties and Rod Marsh hit an unbeaten 110, while McCosker, swathed in bandages, unexpectedly returned at No10 to hit a doughty 25. England\u2019s target was 463 \u2013 60 more than the record successful chase at the time in Tests. Derek Randall made 174, in terms of balls faced the longest England innings in Melbourne, and at 346 for four the improbable was suddenly possible. Randall\u2019s innings proved in vain but was unforgettable (though for sheer endurance Bob Cowper\u2019s 12\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011hour triple century in a draw in 1966 puts it to shame). The MCG was Shane Warne\u2019s home ground and it was where he took his 150th, 350th and 700th Test wickets. The last of these was a particularly emotional moment, coming in December 2006 soon after he had announced his retirement from international cricket. \u201cThere are some special days that happen in your life and some special things that happen and that is definitely one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe birth of your children, getting married, playing your first Test, they\u2019re pretty special. From an individual point of view that\u2019s got to be one of the best days I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Another came at the same ground 12 years previously when Warne claimed his only Test hat-trick as England, chasing an unlikely target of 388, were bowled out for 92. It was the MCG\u2019s fifth Test hat-trick, all taken in pursuit of the Ashes, but the first for more than 90 years. The one Englishman on that list is Willie Bates, another spinner, whose performance in 1883 must rank among the finest in Melbourne: coming in at No8 in the first innings he scored 55, the second-best score of the match, and he then took seven wickets in both Australia innings, including a hat-trick in their first knock. On another tour of Australia five years later, Bates was struck in the face by the ball during a nets session, the injury leaving him with vision so badly affected that he never played first-class cricket again. He died, aged 44, 12 years later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
