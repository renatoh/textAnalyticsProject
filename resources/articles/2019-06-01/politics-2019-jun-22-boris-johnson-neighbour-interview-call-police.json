After hearing a row involving smashing and screaming in the early hours of Friday morning, the individual says they discussed how to respond with their partner, out of concern for the safety of those involved. \u201cThe very last thing I\u2019d heard was a loud bang and screaming. First I knocked on their door to make sure everyone was OK,\u201d they told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cThere was no response at all, I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I knocked three times. Then I went back, discussed further that there was no response and we decided to call the police.\u201d The neighbour, who was waiting up for a takeaway delivery, described loud shouting that could be heard throughout the vicinity, an account backed up by other residents in the area. Another neighbour, a nursery teacher who lives with her husband and four-year-old son in the top flat next door, told the Times that she could hear \u201cshouting and screaming\u201d. Fatimah, 32, said: \u201cIt was really loud, loud enough to make me turn down the TV and see what was going on. I could hear shouting and screaming from a lady, she sounded really angry. There was a man\u2019s voice too, but he was much calmer and he was telling her to calm down but she was still chucking things about,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cIt went on for about 10 minutes. I\u2019ve never heard anything like it. I was considering calling the police but then a [police] van and car came.\u201d The neighbour who called the police said: \u201cI\u2019d heard the screaming and shouting that sounded like it was from the street before I went to get my food. It became clear as I returned that it was coming from inside.\u201d They said that they began recording \u201cpurely out of instinct\u201d. \u201cI had my phone on me because I\u2019d gone to pick up a Deliveroo so I was on the phone to the Deliveroo driver. If I saw someone who I thought was in danger on the street I would start filming while seeking help. I was inside my own flat hearing shouting, screaming and banging so I pressed record. \u201cIt felt like if there was something dangerous happening that having a recording of it would be important as evidence. The screaming maxed out the volume of the microphone on my phone through two doors, which is why we became concerned. \u201cWe called the police and they called back to say thank you for everything that you\u2019d done and luckily no one was hurt. \u201cThe first shouting could be heard from my own living room. I have never heard any other noise in the building, other than the front door opening and closing. People upstairs and on the street could hear it.\u201d They also said they had no involvement with low-key protests about Johnson\u2019s presence from other local residents, despite claims online that neighbours had been hostile. \u201cI have not put anything up. I saw that a poster had been put on his car and obviously saw the same posters across the street. People locally know that Boris Johnson has been there but I have not made any protest about Boris Johnson being a neighbour.\u201d They said they hoped anyone would call the police if they failed to receive a response from a neighbour after hearing such an altercation. \u201cI am not a member of a political party. I\u2019m frustrated politically by the last few years across the board but this was nothing to do with politics, I would hope that anybody that I know \u2013 friends, neighbours \u2013 would have their back if they heard something that sounded scary and frightening,\u201d they said. \u201cI would like to think that we have a duty to look after and look out for neighbours. \u201cI am glad that I recorded everything of the event. I\u2019m glad that the police were satisfied that nothing happened. They said \u2018there\u2019s been a row\u2019 but nobody was hurt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
