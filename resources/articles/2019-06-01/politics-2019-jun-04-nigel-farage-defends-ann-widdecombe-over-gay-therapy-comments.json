The Brexit party leader also claimed that \u201cmany many\u201d Muslims had more extreme views on homosexuality than Widdecombe. \u201cThese things are matters of conscience, I don\u2019t think they are matters for party leaders to support or condemn,\u201d Farage told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. He added: \u201cAnn Widdecombe is a devout Christian and there is nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.\u201d Widdecombe was widely criticised after she appeared to endorse gay conversion therapy in an interview over the weekend. Farage criticised the way she had been \u201chounded\u201d by the media and politicians, and said they failed to show the same vitriol to people of other faiths. He said: \u201cIf we start to attack and condemn people because of religious conscience we are going to cause all sorts of problems, not just with Roman Catholics but with many many others of Muslim faith who have even stronger feelings on this subject than Ann Widdecombe. \u201cWhat\u2019s intolerant is when the pack mentality decides that a certain group of people have a view that is not acceptable in the mainstream and they should be hounded out of public office for having a different point of view.\u201d He added: \u201cLet\u2019s have more people in public life who\u2019ve got their own views on things rather than being told what they should think by mainstream media or their party leaders.\u201d When it was pointed out to him that homosexuality was a matter of fact rather than conscience, Farage said: \u201cPeople\u2019s views on it are a matter of conscience.\u201d And in reference to parents who have objected to school lessons about same-sex relationships, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen outside those schools in Birmingham, Muslim parents protesting.\u201d Farage said he was hoping to meet Donald Trump at some point during his state visit to the UK. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for the call this afternoon,\u201d he said. He also praised the way the US president had conducted himself on the trip, despite Trump\u2019s insults to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Farage said Trump \u201cbehaved with great dignity yesterday. He gave a speech that said all the right things.\u201d He claimed Trump was more popular in the UK than Labour and Conservative leaders. He said: \u201cPeople in this country are seeing an American president who got elected making a series of promises and actually carrying them out. And the contrast between that and the two parties here who write things in manifestoes that they never intend to deliver, is also one of the reasons why Trump\u2019s popularity is much higher now than it was back at the time he was elected.\u201d And he warned Boris Johnson that he would be punished in the polls if he were elected as Conservative leader and then reneged on his promise to leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October. Farage said: \u201cIf Boris wins and he marches his troops up to the top of the hill with the expectation that we are leaving on 31 October and then we don\u2019t and they are marched back down again. In those circumstances in a future general election the Brexit party would produce a result even more stunning than it did in the European elections.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
