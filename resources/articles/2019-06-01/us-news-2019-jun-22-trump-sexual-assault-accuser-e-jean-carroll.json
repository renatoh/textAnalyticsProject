The photo was included in the New York magazine article in which Carroll, a writer and celebrated advice columnist, made public her allegation that Trump assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. \u201cI have no idea who this woman is,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, as he left for weekend meetings at Camp David. When a reporter reminded the president that he and Carroll had appeared in a photo together, he replied: \u201cStanding with my coat on in a line, give me a break. With my back to the camera. I have no idea who she is.\u201d In the article \u2013 an extract from her new book, What Do We Need Men For? \u2013 Carroll alleged that in late 1995 or early 1996, Trump asked her for advice on a gift to buy a female friend. In a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, Carroll wrote, Trump lunged at her and for the next three minutes sexually assaulted her. \u201cHe seizes both my arms and pushes me up against the wall a second time, and, as I become aware of how large he is, he holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights,\u201d she wrote. Carroll said there was then a \u201ccolossal struggle\u201d as Trump opened \u201cthe overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway \u2013 or completely, I\u2019m not certain \u2013 inside me\u201d. New York magazine said two of Carroll\u2019s friends \u2013 prominent but unnamed journalists \u2013 said she told them about the alleged assault at the time and that they had full recollection of her account. On Friday, Trump responded to the allegation for the first time, saying in a statement: \u201cI\u2019ve never met this person in my life. \u201cShe is trying to sell a new book \u2013 that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim that the two had never met was not true. The New York article included a photo of Trump next to his then-wife Ivana Trump and facing Carroll and her then-husband, TV news anchor John Johnson, at a party sometime around 1987. More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Carroll listed 15 of them in her article: Jessica Leeds, Kristin Anderson, Jill Harth, Cathy Heller, Temple Taggart McDowell, Karena Virginia, Melinda McGillivray, Rachel Crooks, Natasha Stoynoff, Jessica Drake, Ninni Laaksonen, Summer Zervos, Juliet Huddy, Alva Johnson and Cassandra Searles. Trump and his allies have dismissed each accusation as a lie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
