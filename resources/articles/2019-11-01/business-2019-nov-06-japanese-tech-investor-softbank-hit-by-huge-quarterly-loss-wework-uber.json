SoftBank\u2019s first quarterly loss in 14 years comes after a dreadful quarter for the tech companies backed by Masayoshi Son\u2019s Vision Fund, a $100bn (\u00a377bn) investment vehicle backed by Saudi sovereign wealth. SoftBank\u2019s operating loss was because of the \u201cdecrease in the fair values of investments including Uber and WeWork\u201d held by its Vision Fund, it said. \u201cMy investment judgment was poor in many ways,\u201d said Son. \u201cI am reflecting deeply on that.\u201d Son revealed he had been admonished by SoftBank board members over its $10.3bn investment in WeWork, and admitted his faith in Neumann was misplaced, in a presentation to investors on Wednesday. He said: \u201cI overestimated Neumann\u2019s good side. I turned a blind eye to [his] bad side on things like corporate governance. I have learned a harsh lesson.\u201d Neumann was forced out of WeWork in October, after the company \u2013 which takes long leases on buildings, invests in trendy decor and then rents out to tenants on short-term agreements \u2013 was forced to abandon its plan to float on Wall Street at the end of September. Potential investors had queried the $47bn valuation given to the nine-year-old business, and raised corporate governance concerns about Neumann and his control of the company. The valuation was more than halved before it was completely abandoned. SoftBank then led a $9.5bn rescue bailout of WeWork and Neumann received an exit package worth $1.7bn. The company is now restructuring and up to 4,000 jobs are expected to go. The company started to tell staff in its EMEA region \u2013 Europe, Middle East and Africa \u2013 about proposed job losses on Wednesday. Up to 1,000 are expected to be made redundant in the region. WeWork said it was \u201cin conversation\u201d with staff \u201cas we make changes to our operating model and workforce in light of our refocused strategy\u201d. It said it was \u201ccommitted to treating our colleagues fairly and with respect\u201d. Son said he was hoping for a \u201chockey stick\u201d recovery in profits, referring to a rapid rise after a period of stagnation. He insisted that WeWork was not a \u201csinking boat\u201d, but needed to cut spending. Shares in Uber, which listed in May and is also a Son investment, fell to a new record low on Tuesday as it posted yet another loss. Some investors in its stock market float are now able to sell their shares for the first time, as a lock-up period has expired. Son\u2019s personal net worth has plunged by about $6bn since July, when it peaked at about $20bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks billionaires\u2019 wealth. The difficult quarter could complicate Son\u2019s efforts to raise a second Vision Fund if investors question his high-risk strategy of making big bets on high-spending, young companies, in the hope that they can expand rapidly and dominate their sectors. Many of the first Vision Fund\u2019s investments are advanced technology companies such as games development platform Improbable and healthcare companies such as gene-sequencing 10x Genomics, but it also includes massive bets on more surprising sectors, such as storage company Clutter and a $300m investment in Wag, which provides dog-walking services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
