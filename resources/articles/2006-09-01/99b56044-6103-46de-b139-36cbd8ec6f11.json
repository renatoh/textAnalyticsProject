Difficult to work with. Someone lacking in courage, without enough 'bottle' to do the country's top job. He's got 'psychological' issues he should tackle. His claims to like the Arctic Monkeys and expressed desire for England to win the World Cup suggest a fake or deceiver at work. Charles Clarke's extraordinarily brutal dissection of Gordon Brown has again thrust the questions about the Chancellor's personality that have persisted at Westminster since the early days of New Labour's time in power back to the forefront of the political agenda. The Observer's political commentator Andrew Rawnsley first raised the issue when he quoted someone close to Tony Blair describing the Chancellor as having 'psychological flaws'. Now it has flared up again, thanks to a senior former cabinet colleague, just as Brown seems closer than ever to swap Number 11 for Number 10 Downing Street. One of Brown's closest allies yesterday angrily dismissed Clarke's comments as an ignorant outburst from a man who neither knew the Chancellor well nor had ever worked closely with him. 'The picture Charles Clarke paints of Gordon is totally untrue,' the ally said. 'He's thoroughly decent, very kind and a good guy to work for, as Ministers who have worked with him at the Treasury, and advisers and civil servants there, would say. This stuff about him being a control freak and uncollegiate is total nonsense. He's a team player, very interested in hearing what people have to say, very open to ideas and thrives on discussion.' Barbara Roche, a former Treasury minister, said she had worked alongside Brown 'very happily. He is a very rigorous boss but a very good boss. The idea that Gordon is not collegiate is absolute nonsense. I saw Gordon listening to fellow ministers, listening to officials.' Giving the Bank of England the independence to set interest rates, his first decisive act as Chancellor in 1997, showed that he was prepared to take risks when necessary, added the ally. A friend said that the death of Brown's daughter Jennifer from a brain haemorrhage at just 10 days old in 2002 also disproved Clarke's claim. 'He's unfortunately had to demonstrate courage in the most difficult and tragic circumstances,' said the friend. But Derek Scott, a former adviser to Brown on economics, said: 'Some of the descriptions that Charles Clarke has used do reflect the way I saw Gordon Brown behave in Whitehall with other ministers and particularly with the Prime Minister - to some extent a control freak. 'There are aspects of Gordon's personality which will make it difficult if he is Prime Minister, if he doesn't change.' Dr Ian Cockerill, an experienced chartered psychologist, said: 'There's a paradox here in that Gordon Brown has never been more fulfilled as a father and as a family man yet has never seemed more unfulfilled as a politician. To me his behaviour is born of frustration that in his mind he was promised the ultimate prize but now feels there's a possibility that it could be snatched from him.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
