Hans Blix said the Iraqi representatives have said \"that they accept all the rights of inspections that are laid down\" in previous resolutions authorising UN inspections. The agreement, thrashed out in Vienna, comes ahead of any new UN security resolution on weapons inspection which is currently being sought by Washington and London. A new UN resolution may change the Iraqi position and there have been reports that sources close to the inspection team fear this could undermine their mission. The main progress for the inspectors was on practical details such as an agreement that the UN team will now be allowed to fly into Baghdad's main airport, rather than one further way. The decision on whether to amend the agreement will be taken by the UN security council when Mr Blix reports back on Thursday. If the UN security council formally approves the mission it could begin by the third week of October. Suggesting that little stood in the way for the resumption of inspections, Amir Al Sadi, the head of the Iraqi negotiation team, told reporters: \"We expect the advance party to arrive in Baghdad in about two weeks.\" Mr Al Sadi declined to outline specifics on what was agreed but suggested terms of the inspection would be regulated by previous security council resolutions. That would keep spontaneous inspection of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces - a US demand - off the agenda. The negotiations were to determine how far Iraq will let the UN inspect government buildings and presidential palaces but also to amend a 1998 UN-Iraq agreement on inspections that restricted the inspectors' access to eight presidential sites. The Bush administration is pushing for a resolution that would eliminate the conditions from an earlier agreement in 1998, saying that failure to comply would result in grave consequences. Mr Blix said the talks focused on practical aspects of the renewed inspections such as, \"Where do you fly into Baghdad ... what are the customs controls ... the accommodation of inspectors in Baghdad ... the movement within Iraq. We have talked openly about them, and we have gone through what you can at this stage,\" he said. President Saddam pledged unconditional access to sites across Iraq last month but Baghdad has since rejected the notion of a new UN resolution - that would broaden and toughen the inspection regime. An Iraqi cabinet spokesman said today that threats of war will not force the country to accept any new UN resolutions it finds objectionable. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said in a television interview yesterday that before inspectors returned to Iraq, Mr Blix would have to wait and see whether the security council came up with new guidance or additional resolutions that might require him to modify his plan. \"I'm pleased that he is in that state of readiness and we'll have to see how things develop over the next couple of weeks with respect to a resolution with new requirements,\" Mr Powell said. Meanwhile, delivering his keynote speech at the Labour party conference in Birmingham, the prime minister, Tony Blair, was unwavering in his stance on Iraq and his support for the US. Mr Blair said: \"My vision of Britain is not as the 51st state of anywhere, but I believe in this alliance and I will fight long and hard to maintain it.\" He went on: \"Let us lay down the ultimatum. Let Saddam comply with the will of the UN ... but here is the hard part: if he doesn't comply, then consider ... sometimes, and in particular dealing with a dictator, the only chance of peace is a readiness for war.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
