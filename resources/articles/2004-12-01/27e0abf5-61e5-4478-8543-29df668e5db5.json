Also known as \"greenies\" or \"crank\", amphetamines have been an accepted part of the sport for so long that many clubs used to keep jars of them in the locker room and the phrase \"beaned up\" has entered the lexicon. Up to 75% of major leaguers are estimated to be regularly ingesting substances which the game's governing body currently is not even allowed to test for. On Tuesday, representatives of the players' union, Major League Baseball Players Association, met those of Major League Baseball in New York to begin discussions about revamping the sport's toothless drug-testing policy. For all the media hysteria induced by the continuing Balco scandal, in which baseball's Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield have been caught up, many observers feel that the most graphic illustration of a serious intent to clean up the game would be a decision to ban amphetamines. Though the union has to this point refused to admit that \"greenies\" are even performance-enhancing drugs, the evidence suggests otherwise. \"This is all going to be very interesting,\" said one Major League club manager in an interview with New York's Daily News last Sunday, \"because if we do get steroids out of our sport, which we should, and we get amphetamines out, it will be real interesting to see what it does to the level of play. I know that's a scary statement but it's true.\" Amphetamines were widely used in the second world war as a means of helping soldiers fend off the onset of fatigue, and traces were found in the cyclist Tommy Simpson's blood when he collapsed and died during the 1967 Tour de France. The drug is prohibited by the International Olympic Committee and American football's NFL, and baseball's amphetamine culture was first exposed in Ball Four, Jim Bouton's classic 1970 diary of a season in the major leagues, one of the best-selling sports books ever. Bouton incurred the wrath of his peers for writing candidly about, among other things, the way players casually popped \"greenies\" before games. The authorities reacted by condemning the messenger and ignoring the message. Just how little changed in the ensuing decades was demonstrated by the comments of the former San Diego Padre Tony Gwynn last year. \"People might think there is a steroid problem in baseball but it's nowhere near the other problem; the other, it's a rampant problem,\" said Gwynn, who retired in 2001. \"Guys feel like steroids are cheating and greenies aren't. Sooner or later it's going to get out that there's a greenie problem, and it's a huge one. Guys feel like they need an edge. It didn't seem like there was a lot of it earlier in my career but I know that coming down to the end of my career it was rampant in my club. I would just laugh at the guys. I'd be like: 'You're 23 years old. What the heck, look at me, I'm in my late 30s, and I'm taking two aspirin and saying, let's go'.\" Like Bouton 30 years previously, Gwynn was roundly criticised for his candour, yet when the dust settled the substance of his allegations remained intact. \"I would say he is pretty accurate in that statement,\" the Atlanta Braves outfielder Chipper Jones said of Gwynn's comments. \"There is probably a little bit more of a problem as far as that goes than with the steroids. This is a tough, tough lifestyle. Guys are paid a lot of money to show up at the right time and do their job and sometimes they need a little help.\" A gruelling 162-game regular-season schedule that criss-crosses the continent, often punctuated by double-headers (when they play an afternoon and a night match at the same venue), may at least explain why amphetamines have long been accepted as a necessary evil. Many regard them as a way for players to pep themselves up when the strains of the travelling and marathon matches lasting up to five hours a night take their toll. \"Amphetamines belong to a class of drugs called sympathomimetic amines or stimulants that cause the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, to stimulate the central nervous system,\" said Dr Gary Wadler, a New York University professor of medicine and a consultant with the World Anti-Doping Agency. \"They are controlled substances commonly called \"uppers\" and induce false feelings of power, strength, self-assertion and enhanced motivation. \"Amphetamines are most often taken orally, with blood levels peaking in one to two hours and effects appearing in 30 minutes and lasting in excess of three hours.\" A poll of baseball fans this week indicated that 61% of them now feel that players who test positive for performance-enhancing drugs should be banned. Whether the players' union is ready to get in line with the rest of the sporting world and admit amphetamines are exactly that remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
