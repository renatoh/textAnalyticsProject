Walter Smith's side led 1-0 from the first leg at Ibrox and were last night indebted to the goalkeeping heroics of Allan McGregor and some resilient defending during 90 minutes of intense football. Rangers could even have won the game as Jean-Claude Darcheville had the best chance of the second half but the Frenchman missed the target. \"I thought that we team-wise worked very hard,\" Smith said. \"It was always an awkward game for us, right from the very start.They looked to get the ball forward early and put our defence under pressure and McGregor and the back four handled it very well. \"The midfielders had to work extremely hard but we got what we wanted in the end and are delighted to be in the Champions League. It was a good performance overall in terms of work ethic - this team's had that since the start of the season.\" Smith used his usual European 4-5-1 formation but had to rely on McGregor for a number of important saves, starting in the fourth minute when he blocked Igor Burzanovic's low shot. The home side continued to look threatening and Darcheville looked ominously isolated up front. Crvena Zvezda should have gone ahead when Filip Dordevic's shot was deflected into the path of Dusan Andjelkovic but the defender sliced his right-footed shot well over the bar from 10 yards. McGregor then kept Rangers ahead in the tie with another save from a goal-bound drive from 15 yards by Andjelkovic. Darcheville, with three goals in his past two games, had his clear opportunity to put Rangers 2-0 ahead on aggregate in the 57th minute. The former Bordeaux forward peeled away from his marker to give himself a run towards the goalkeeper Ivan Randjelovic but he drilled a left-footed shot across goal and wide of the post. Lee McCulloch also came close from 25 yards but his low shot was diverted wide by the goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
