Their awkward second album, News and Tributes, didn't exactly capitalise on that brief skirmish with fame and their label dropped them. This self-released third album is packed with all the skew-whiff terrace shout-alongs missing from their second effort. 'The Beginning of the Twist' is an album-opening call to arms; elsewhere, you can hear the Futureheads' frenetic post-punk de-evolving into Clash- shapes. It's not an unqualified success, but this simpler, bolder approach ensures the world will continue to take an interest in the foursome. Kitty Empire Martina Topley Bird - The Blue God (Independiente) \u00a310.99 It took Martina Topley Bird nearly a decade to step out of Tricky's shadow and go solo. Her debut, Quixotic, was a disappointment, summoning up little of the vocal magic she cast on Maxinquaye. Now, five years later, she's back with a second, and The Blue God sounds as unrushed as its gestation. This time, Topley Bird has teamed up with many-handed producer Danger Mouse, whose understated compositions evolve with each listen. It's a much better effort than her debut - 'Baby Blue' and first single 'Carnies' are fine tracks - but it never really smoulders the way it should. Killian Fox The Pigeon Detectives - Emergency (Vital) \u00a310.99 Just a year after football stands first shook to their platinum-selling debut Wait for Me, Pigeon Detectives return with more bloke rock for terrace boys to roar along to. From the rough (turgid lead single 'This Is an Emergency') to the faux-smooth (slimy break-up ballad 'Nothing to do With You'), Emergency proves exactly the second album you'd expect from a band that once encouraged female fans to get involved with onstage wet T-shirt competitions. It's warm lager and sunburn stuff, all boisterous guitar duelling and aren't-women-incomprehensible ranting. Henry Barnes Bonnie 'Prince' Billy - Lie Down in the Light (Domino) \u00a310.99 In a career spanning 15 years, Will 'BPB' Oldham has provided moments of great solemnity (the abyss-gazing folk of 1999's I See a Darkness) and greater silliness (last year's turn as a tractor-cruising hick-hopper in an alternative Kanye West video). Such extremes are largely absent here. Oldham's alt-country has never felt less alt or more homely on tracks such as 'You Want That Picture'. But the warmth of the sound, laps of pedal steel and percussive patter, compensate for a lack of bite. As ever, there's buried treasure in his lyrics, which rub against the grain of these oak-aged arrangements. Ally Carnwath Mick Hucknall - Tribute to Bobby (Simplyred.com) \u00a311.99 Although Bobby Bland, 78, is the most sophisticated blues singer of his generation, he's never received the acclaim he deserves. Hucknall seems an improbable champion of Bland's intense vocal style, but he rises to the occasion. Wisely, Hucknall declines to ape Bland's originals, delivering signature songs like 'I Pity the Fool' and 'Farther up the Road' in cooler, more melodic fashion while bringing a gravitas and a sense of timing he rarely showed with the now-defunct Simply Red. A subtle slim-down of the original big band arrangements completes an accessible, worthy act of homage. Neil Spencer Tom Richards - Orchestra Smoke and Mirrors (Candid) \u00a311.99 Tom Richards plays saxophone and keyboards on tour with Jamie Cullum, which some may consider a full-time job, but he clearly has a lot more music in his head and, at 26, the energy to bring it to light. These seven tracks are exceptional by any standards. To start with, this is a true orchestra, not a conventional 'big band'. Richards draws a wealth of delicate textures from the 23 players, seamlessly weaving together improvised solos and written ensemble. As a composer, Tom Richards sounds only like himself, but if pushed to suggest a comparison, I would cite the work of the late, great Neil Ardley.
