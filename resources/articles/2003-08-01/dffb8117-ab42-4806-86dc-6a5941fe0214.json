For the past few seasons Jean Pierre Guillambert, 20, has proved to be a natural in the saddle, and Nick Littmoden's 5lb claiming apprentice is currently on 27 winners. \"The JP\" as he is known to his colleagues is a son of Parisien Jean-Luc, a former amateur jockey who rode alongside some of the biggest names in the business and married Wendy, three-times winner of the Miss Watney beauty title, after they met at his former Brighton restaurant. Now their daughter Francoise, 25, a leading show jumper, has sold her horses - Starman and Sparticus - and decided to join her brother in the Sport of Kings. She has received her amateur licence and will join Newmarket trainer Paul Howling. Her mother said: \"My husband had been trying to persuade her to ride as an amateur for a long time and now in the light of Jean Pierre's success she has done it.\" Her father was a crack amateur jockey over jumps, riding out for Josh Gifford, but his fortune was made elsewhere. His Ascot Supreme Horseboxes are at the luxury end of the equine transport market with fitted showers and all mod cons for staff taking horses to meetings. \"I'm proud of Jean Pierre after what he has done and he will go a lot further as he rides for London trainer Andrew Reid as well as Nick's stable. I got a tremendous kick when he won a \u00a310,000 handicap at Lingfield on one of my horses, Lakota Brave.\" JP has risen through the ranks in an unusual way. He was never going to stay at Epsom College for the sixth form as he was long gone before breakfast every morning, slipping away to ride out at Geoff Lewis' stable before lessons. At 16 he left school, spending time at the predominantly jumping establishments of champion trainer Martin Pipe and Mark Pitman before moving to Jamie Osborne's yard en route to Littmoden. Pipe thought he had natural talent, but felt he was too light for a jumping career and advised him to go on to the Flat for a couple of seasons before returning the National Hunt. However, having no trouble in keeping his weight to 8st 3lb, he has decided to stay on the level where he is sporting a 13 per cent strike rate in the jockey's table and the only claiming rider above him is the unstoppable Ryan Moore. Guillambert said: \"The weight can be a struggle, but at the end of the day I would rather miss a dinner than end up falling off as you tend to do jumping. My aim is to end up as leading all-weather apprentice and I'm well clear with 21 wins on the board at present.\" He is looking forward to his sister's participation. \"As kids we used to show-jump together and there was always a bit of competition. Now that I have progressed in racing she is hoping for a bit of the limelight too.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
