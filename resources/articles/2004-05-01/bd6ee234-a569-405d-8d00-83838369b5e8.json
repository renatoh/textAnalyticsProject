The top eight countries in the 2003 tournament are automatically involved in 2007, plus 12 qualifiers. England, Australia, New Zealand and France, the top quartet in 2003, will comprise the first 'band' of four but the second tier - Ireland, South Africa, Wales and Scotland - are not seeded and will be drawn at random. With the qualification stages not yet under way, the third tier is set to comprise the top-rated qualifiers based on the IRB world rankings - almost certainly Italy, Argentina, Samoa and Fiji. The fourth tier will work on a similar basis, with the last two places in 'band five' going to the winners of the repechage round (US and Tonga in 2003).
