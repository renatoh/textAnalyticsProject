Sam Allardyce, who was sacked after a 2-1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers and felt that his deputy had betrayed him, was at Ewood Park to see Kean's downfall. \"Big Sam,\" yelled the home and away ends at the club's owners, who were thousands of miles away. \"You should have kept Big Sam.\" In the end, everything was against him. His local paper, the Lancashire Evening Telegraph, had demanded his sacking; so too had his MP, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw. When, with seconds remaining, Chris Samba directed a header inches wide, Kean gave a tired half\u2011smile. Then, when it was all done, he went to shake Owen Coyle's hand, taking tiny steps towards the Bolton manager, who would not have expected to survive long had Blackburn won. Then, as Kean and Coyle turned down the tunnel, one received a hug from his chairman, the other had a shirt thrown in his face by a supporter. Kean's wife was among the crowd and she would not have been human had she not wondered if any job was worth this. Given what was at stake for both teams, this was an occasion \u2013 but only in the sense that a backroom, bare-knuckle fight or a stag hunt is an occasion. It was bloody and brutal and in the end it was Coyle, the boy from the Gorbals, who was the one left standing. Given that his job, too, may have depended on the result, Coyle had made a big call before kick-off, dropping Kevin Davies, a footballer who at Bolton occupies something near the stature of a modern Nat Lofthouse, to the bench. Had Bolton lost the match, it might have echoed Ruud Gullit's dropping of Alan Shearer just before the rain-sodden Tyne-Wear derby that sealed the Dutchman's fate as Newcastle manager. \"I just thought that Kevin was trying too hard,\" said Coyle. \"The club meant too much to him.\" As it was, another Davies, Mark, ripped Blackburn's makeshift defence apart before five minutes were up. In Kean's defence it should be said that he had precious little to choose from. Ga\u00ebl Givet was recovering from a heart condition, while Scott Dann had ruptured a testicle during Saturday's defeat by West Bromwich Albion. They are not usual injuries but they are the kind that tend to afflict managerial regimes careering towards their doom. Kean did, however, have the option to select M\u00edchel Salgado, a full-back good enough to have won a European Cup with Real Madrid. However, the 36-year-old had been told to find another club \u2013 he could hardly have done worse than some of his replacements. On Saturday, Morten Gamst Pedersen had played left-back for the first time in his life. If it was one of the last decisions of Kean's managerial career at Ewood Park, it was among his least inspired. The Norwegian was responsible for West Brom's winner on Saturday and on Tuesday he was nowhere near David Ngog as the striker slipped in the area and was allowed to recover his footing and then pick out Davies, who shot fiercely past Paul Robinson. Kean stood open-mouthed in his black raincoat, as well he might. There had been five Blackburn defenders in the area, including one on the line. It took Blackburn until the 34th minute to mount a coherent attack, and that finished with Simon Vukcevic shooting into the side-netting. Furthermore, by then Bolton were two goals up. The second was at least well worked as Nigel Reo-Coker exchanged passes with Martin Petrov and finished off the Bulgarian's return. The midfielder was allowed a suicidal amount of space between the inadequate figures of Grant Hanley and Pedersen. Coyle punched the air wildly in celebration. There was, however, one thing running in Blackburn's favour. They were two goals down against a side whose defensive inadequacies have been as nakedly obvious as their own this season. There has never been a serious suggestion that Kean has ever lost his dressing room but during the interval he lost his temper completely. With Junior Hoilett shifted to the left flank, suddenly his players threw themselves forward. Steven Nzonzi looked distraught after shooting over but then Yakubu Ayegbeni, whose four goals had saved Kean from what would have been a terminal defeat against Swansea earlier this month, burst beyond Gary Cahill to finish exquisitely past Jussi Jaaskelainen. There was a flare of hope but in Pune, where Venky's directors were watching a live feed, it was nearly two in the morning and Kean's time was almost up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
