The firm that grew into a small empire from a single shop in Brighton, said it was in preliminary discussions with a \"number of interested parties\". An attempt by The Body Shop to sell itself to the Mexican firm, Omnilife, for \u00a3290m earlier this year collapsed. Confirmation of takeover talks followed an announcement two weeks ago in which The Body Shop, founded by Anita Roddick, had been approached by various parties. Possible buyers have been tipped to include private equity house Schroder Ventures. Today's announcement also came as The Body Shop reported a slump in profits over the last half-year period. Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to September 1 fell to \u00a32.6m, from \u00a36.8m, while turnover rose 5% to \u00a3167.1m. In an update, the group added worldwide retail sales had been affected by the terrorist attacks in the US, which increased overall uncertainty about economic stability and consumer confidence. In common with many other retailers, it added that its outcome for the full year was \"highly reliant on trading during the Christmas period\". However the firm is sticking with its previous profit forecasts made a week after the US attacks, when it said it expected full-year profits to be \"broadly in line with last year\". The group however showed like-for-like sales for the half year fell 2%, with the largest decline seen in the UK and the Republic of Ireland - 4% lower. Chief executive Patrick Gournay said: \"Our results are in line with what we announced two weeks ago and the reason for the profits difference is coming from two areas - one is the timing of sales to franchisees and secondly is because we had a few one-off items. Altogether, we are maintaining our forecast for this year broadly in line with last year.\" To boost sales in the UK, he said the group was planning to open new stores, launch new products and boost marketing. Mr Gournay said 50 new stores will be opened in the UK and America, and 50 others will be refitted. An aggressive marketing campaign targeting customers aged 20 to 30 will focus on eight cities - Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, London and Bristol. Commenting on the effect of the terrorist attack on the business, Mr Gournay said the group had an advantage in that its operations were internationally spread and that it was the more prestigious brands which tended to suffer in a downturn. \"Our business is very international and balanced,\" he said. \"If there was any downturn it would affect more prestige brands than brands like us. We have seen that in the past, particularly in the Asian crisis, where our brands have been a lot more resilient.\" The Body Shop achieved iconic status in the 1980s with its natural products and socially conscious attitudes. But other retailers have invaded its niche market, and its share price has slumped. British supermarkets have been taking an increasing share of the health and beauty market away from specialist stores. By 2006, according to Verdict Research, supermarkets will have doubled their market share to 60%. The Body Shop now operates 1,900 shops in 50 countries and makes most of its profit in Asia. Anita Roddick, a proponent of \"ethical capitalism\", is said to have become disillusioned with the company. She has come under fire from investors for lacking business nous and has been pressured into taking a more hands-off role as joint chairperson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
