The man who had caused them was Usman Khan, a 28-year old delegate from Staffordshire who was released from prison last year after pleading guilty in 2012 to offences including planning to create a terrorist training camp in Kashmir. He had attended the morning session of Cambridge University\u2019s Learning Together conference, which had explored the importance of storytelling and creative writing in reforming criminals. It was a thoughtful scene in grand surroundings watched over by a celebrated portrait of the Queen. Bryonn Bain, an American playwright and prison activist, had just left delegates with the inspiring thought that \u201cwithout vulnerability there is no courage\u201d when Khan made his transformation from delegate to killer. Jack Merritt, 25, a course coordinator and Cambridge graduate, went to investigate the shouts and was the first person to confront Khan at the door, Bain said on Monday. Khan launched a lethal attack, slashing and stabbing with a pair of knives, at least one of which was taped to his wrist. Under his jacket he had a fake bomb vest and he reportedly threatened to blow up the building. He killed Merritt, who Bain said was \u201cthe first line of defence\u201d and was brave. He also killed Saskia Jones, 23, another Cambridge graduate who was volunteering for the project. Bain told the BBC he went to investigate too. \u201cI saw people die,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw things I am never going to be able to unsee.\u201d Among those who responded first were some of the ex-offenders, said Cambridge University, which runs the programme. They managed to get Khan away from the main conference area. The screams from the attack were heard in the basement, where a Polish kitchen porter, \u0141ukasz, was cleaning glasses, according to Commodore Toby Williamson, the clerk of the City of London livery society, who gave a detailed account of the attack on Monday. \u201cThe scream is so loud that as a first aider he makes a choice,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cHe goes towards the trouble on the first floor of the building and it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s a bad guy. He\u2019s got two knives in his hands, there is blood, there is screaming, there is chaos. \u201c\u0141ukasz pulls off the wall this long stick, he charges towards the bad guy and impacts him on the chest and there\u2019s clearly something here that is protective and it doesn\u2019t make any sort of impact. But he is buying time. He allows others to escape to adjacent rooms. \u201cHe has about a one-minute one-on-one straight combat,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cThis guy, we now know by the name of Khan, he works his way up \u0141ukasz\u2019s pole, slashing with his knife. He [\u0141ukasz] takes five wounds to his left side.\u201d Khan hacked into \u0141ukasz\u2019s arm, Williamson said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s hurt badly but doesn\u2019t flinch for a minute.\u201d By Williamson\u2019s account, \u0141ukasz bought time for two delegates to get involved, one of them understood to be Marc Conway, an ex-offender at the conference. \u201cThey come and join the fight and it\u2019s pretty gruesome,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cI think the terrorist decided he was outnumbered. He runs for it. He goes down the main staircase and the next bit of hell is at reception. He can\u2019t get out the front door. \u201cOur guy called Gareth, who is the reception doorman, is pushing the door shut as good as he can so that Dawn, a yard behind, can get on the telephones, hit the alarms \u2013 exactly as her training has told her to do.\u201d There was a \u201cgreat showdown in the entrance hall\u201d involving Andy, a maintenance man, \u201ca Ministry of Defence ex-policeman and pretty cool customer\u201d, who had to weigh up whether to let Khan out on to the street. \u201cHe makes exactly the right choice,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cThe doors opened. Out the terrorist falls and the first one after him is \u0141ukasz shouting at everyone to get out of the way, get back. \u201cBut I tell you what, members of the public, they just don\u2019t do that nowadays. They do what they needed to do. They join in \u2026 \u0141ukasz is losing strength on his left side at this point but I tell you what, his job is done.\u201d Another who chased Khan as he ran southwards over London Bridge was James Ford, who was jailed for life in April 2004 for the murder of Amanda Champion, a 21-year-old woman with learning difficulties. Other members of the public also joined the fray, including Thomas Gray, 24, a Mini driver for a tour based on the film The Italian Job. Khan was pulled to the ground as one man sprayed him with a fire extinguisher. \u201cI saw that he had a knife in each hand so I decided to stamp on his left wrist as hard as I could to try to free one of the knives off as it appeared to be taped to his hand,\u201d said Gray. \u201cThe only thing that we heard from the suspect was \u2018get off of me\u2019. The overall resounding message from the chaps involved was that it\u2019s not going to happen. We just kind of held him there and did what we could until the police arrived. I grew up on rugby and the mentality, be that on the pitch or off the pitch, is it\u2019s one in, it\u2019s all in. \u201cI saw that something was going on, so originally, before even knowing what the incident was, I wanted to separate the incident and make sure someone wasn\u2019t getting beaten to a pulp. While I was there and then realised what was going on, I was kind of like, \u2018I can\u2019t run away now, I\u2019ve got to stick it out and help out as best I can.\u2019\u201d With armed City of London police officers on the scene, Khan was surrounded. One police officer could be heard shouting: \u201cHe\u2019s got a bomb, mind your backs!\u201d The men quickly stepped back and the officer shouted at Khan: \u201cDo not move!\u201d Within moments, the attack ended when officers opened fire, onlookers hearing multiple shots. Shortly afterwards Bain, by now well away from the scene, took a moment to compose a tweet: \u201cBomber is dead. Shot by London special forces. Another killed. Two injured. Evacuating to a survivors\u2019 center. I\u2019m ok. Be grateful for every day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
