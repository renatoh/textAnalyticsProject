Hodgson publicly challenged Inter to meet the \u00a325m asking price for Mascherano on Wednesday, having grown tired of the uncertainty surrounding the Argentina captain. Hodgson later attempted to resolve the impasse with a call to Moratti, whom he worked under during two spells at San Siro in the 90s, and was informed the European champions would not be making an offer. Representatives of both clubs had met previously to discuss the transfer and Moratti also confirmed the Italian club will not pursue interest in Kuyt, despite the Dutch international's agent claiming yesterday that a move remains possible. Rob Jansen said: \"There is real interest from Inter, but Dirk has not yet decided if he wants to leave Liverpool.\" Hodgson has now discounted the possibility of Kuyt and Mascherano joining their former manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez in Milan, but admitted that there was genuine interest from the Italian champions. The Liverpool manager said: \"I spoke to Massimo Moratti on Wednesday about the fact they are not going to buy Liverpool players, and Dirk comes into that category doesn't he? I believe Inter were only interested in two of our players and they are not going to buy them. Moratti said they are not going to do that.\" Barcelona's sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, has ruled out a bid from them for Mascherano, who was priced out of a move to Spain last summer but promised he could leave in this window providing a suitable offer materialised. That now appears extremely unlikely, leaving the 26-year-old little option but to remain at Liverpool, where his wife and young family have failed to settle, and to reconsider signing a contract extension that has been on the table since the end of last season. Inter's withdrawal is an unexpected boon for Hodgson, who arrived at Anfield fearing he would lose at least one of Mascherano, Steven Gerrard or Fernando Torres this summer but now, for varying reasons, is likely to retain all three. The Liverpool manager does not believe the Argentinean's personal difficulties will prove a lasting problem for the club given they have not received an offer to reject. The Italians' decision, however, does raise questions over Liverpool's recent \u00a34.5m purchase of Christian Poulsen, the 30-year-old Denmark international who, like Mascherano, operates as a defensive midfielder. Transfer funds are limited at Anfield and Hodgson wants a left-back plus cover for Fernando Torres, although he hopes to reduce numbers in midfield and the wage bill by allowing Aquilani to return to Italy on a season-long loan. Aquilani has been a disastrous acquisition so far. Signed from Roma for \u00a318m last summer to replace Xabi Alonso, the Italy international did not make his debut until October due to an ankle injury and started only nine Premier League games as he failed to make an impact. Liverpool are now in talks with Juventus. \"That is the offer that excites us,\" said the midfielder's agent, Franco Zavaglia, and the loan deal may include an option for the 26-year-old's permanent transfer. Hodgson explained: \"After last year, when he came here injured and hardly played, it would be a disaster for him to have two years of hardly any football. If he can get regular games for a top Serie A team, it gives him the football he needs and protects the value of the player. But first we need to get him back to being the player he was when he came over a year ago. We're doing it with a view to bringing him back. \"He came here to play every week as a very expensive signing, the first name on the team sheet. But with Steven Gerrard, Javier Mascherano and Joe Cole, it's going to be very hard for me to say: 'You'll always be the first name on that team sheet,' so he would risk not getting enough games again.\" Liverpool travel to Manchester City on Monday night, when Torres could make his first start for the club since 8 April. \"He's been ready to start all the games this season,\" said Hodgson. \"It's just a question of making sure we don't rush things, and with David Ngog and Ryan Babel we don't have to.\" The Liverpool manager also hopes to have Mascherano and Daniel Agger available, after the pair suffered a calf injury and concussion respectively against Arsenal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
