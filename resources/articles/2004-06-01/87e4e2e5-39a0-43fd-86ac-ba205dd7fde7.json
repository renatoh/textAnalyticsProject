The resolution receives a more cautious welcome elsewhere. Spain's El Pa\u00eds leads on how Madrid has been put on the defensive by the resolution. The government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero came to power promising to pull the more than 3,000 Spanish troops out of Iraq if there was no UN agreement on the handover by June 30. It withdrew them last month assuming that no deal was to be made. Mariano Rajoy, the opposition leader, the man the previous prime minister wanted to succeed him, is quoted by the paper accusing Mr Zapatero of lying to the Spanish people over the prospect of a resolution. The foreign minister, Miguel \u00c1ngel Moratinos, tells the paper the resolution confirms \"100% the validity of the Spanish government's decision to withdraw the troops.\" In neighbouring France, the country that pressurised Britain and the US into accepting changes to the earlier drafts, George Bush remains the main focus of the story. This is not a case of re-united nations but, as left-of-centre Lib\u00e9ration has it, the UN voting for Bush. In spite of this supposed US victory, New York Times columnist William Safire is worried that the price will be paid by the Kurds. A Transitional Administrative Law, drawn up by the US-appointed governing council in February, laid the groundwork for a permanent constitution that would respect minority rights, but Safire says Washington has since abandoned it under pressure from Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Iraq's most senior Shia cleric said a text \"legislated by an unelected council in the shadow of occupation\" could not be included in the resolution. A subsequent letter from Kurdish leaders told President Bush the Kurds would always be friends of America but had concerns what that friendship would mark them out for if \"the forces of freedom\" did not prevail elsewhere in Iraq. \"I ran this pained appeal past John Negroponte, who will move from his post as our UN representative to be our ambassador to the new Iraq, at his farewell lunch yesterday,\" Safire writes. \"He pointed to a line in the preamble to the UN resolution welcoming an unspecified commitment 'to work towards a federal, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq, in which there is full respect for political and human rights'. Fine 'preambular' words, but outside the action section of the resolution. That eviscerates the protective law, just as Sistani demanded.\" Further down the United States' east coast, the Washington Post says the resolution has shown the security council has \"moved beyond its bitter fight\" over Iraq, but an article on its comment pages wonders what will happen if the country shows no sign of becoming a stable democracy. \"What if Iraq can't be fixed? What are the options?\" asks Daniel Serwer. \"Partition is one. But then what happens in Baghdad, where perhaps 800,000 Kurds live, quite separated from their beloved Kurdistan? ... Another option is the strongman: King Abdullah of Jordan suggests we find someone like that to preside over a relatively benevolent and modernising autocracy. But what do we do if he turns out not so benevolent, or falls to rebellion ... Aggressive internationalisation is another approach, with the European Union and the UN playing stronger roles. Are others prepared to ante up? I talked with European experts on Iraq recently in Brussels. The political debate throughout the continent, they said, is mainly about withdrawal.\" Of course, Serwer's preferred course of events is for Iraq not to get to the stage where it \"can't be fixed\" - and he says the US should stick to its course, supporting Iraqis who want to build a strong civil society. \"Even if you think the war was wrong, the peace should still be right. Success in the effort to give Iraqis a chance to build a free society will set back extremism in the Muslim world and be a major step.\" Rami Khouri, a writer for Lebanon's Daily Star, detects a change in the US's outlook. From the all guns blazing invasion of Iraq last year, propelled by cries of regime change and neo-conservative ideology, it has since shown flexibility in its dealings with the interim government, brought the UN back into the transition process and negotiated with the most rebellious Iraqis instead of fighting them to the end. \"Perhaps Washington has learned the negative consequences of treating the world's countries primarily as markets and targets,\" he writes. \"This may be only a short-term tactical move to get the US out of Iraq, and get President Bush re-elected in November. Yet we should not rule out the possibility that it may represent the start of a qualitative change in America's dealings with the world, with realism replacing romanticism, the possible replacing the ideal, and negotiated compromises replacing dictates made at gunpoint.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
