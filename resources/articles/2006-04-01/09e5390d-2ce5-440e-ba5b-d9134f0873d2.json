A spokesman for Real Fathers4Justice said two members had climbed about 18m (60ft) up the abbey in central London. They were carrying a dummy on a cross to signify that fathers are being crucified by the state, he said, \"They had Roman soldier costumes, but the police have snatched them.\" The group appealed to the church to intervene on behalf of fathers. The police confirmed that \"an incident\" had taken place at the abbey, but gave no details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
