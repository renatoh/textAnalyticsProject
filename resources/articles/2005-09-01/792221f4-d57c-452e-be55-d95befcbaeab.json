And the worst customer-relations experience was being asked by the cinema's pick-'n'-mix fascists if there was any 'outside' (ie affordable) food or drink in my bag at the entrance to Screen One. Yes, they called me sir, but so did the stewards at Gillingham - twice. Very impressive, I thought, until they turned silly and chucked out three Portsmouth fans who were just having a bit of banter with a number of barely-post-pubescent local chavs. 'Have your bollocks dropped, have your bollocks dropped?' they sang, to the tune of Middle of the Road's timeless classic, 'Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep'. A somewhat different dialogue to Sunday night, when an audience devoid of male teenagers heard one Bennet sister tell another, 'He is what a young man ought to be, sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! So much ease, with such perfect good breeding!' Not so good-humoured was the Gillingham steward who, the away fans decided, looked like the Milky Bar Kid. They sang Milky Bar songs all night - hats off to all who knew the entire song from the original advert - and that may have led to the early exits. Cinema or football, there's trouble with chocolate. The singing was often more diverting than the game which, despite three goals, a missed penalty, and two sensational goalkeeping errors, wasn't up to much. It certainly wasn't worth three cinema tickets, not for a seat on a stand made of scaffolding behind the goal. The pleasant surprises were that you could buy a (plastic) bottle of beer inside the ground, and the pies were good. The tea was \u00a31, the homemade pies \u00a33, the beer \u00a32.50, and a Twix 50p - and no one stopped me taking it to my seat. Being in Gillingham is pretty depressing whatever the weather: if it had rained it would have been unbearable. Fewer than 5,000 turned up. Cinema 1, Football 0 Red Eye at Apollo Regent Street, London, \u00a38.50 Grays Athletic v Cambridge, \u00a310 Some critics have hailed Wes Craven's political assassination thriller for its psychological and sexual subtext as a female hotel manager duels with a blue-eyed terrorist on a flight to Miami - but there was more panache and subtlety down at the Recreation Ground, where Grays' direct, effective football yielded four goals before half-time. Both venues have had a revamp. The Apollo has changed its regulation multi-screen livery to a sub-Blade Runner aesthetic featuring glittering stairways, in-toilet digital TVs and a bar lit like Stringfellows - mineral water \u00a31.50, coffee \u00a32. Down in deepest Essex, \u00a35.10 buys a pint of Foster's and a vodka and orange in Grays' spruce new bar, while it's \u00a32.50 for an unconvincing burger (long queue, and the food ran out during the second half). Apollo staff were young and friendly; at the Rec the atmosphere was barrow-boy done good. This is Grays' story, too, courtesy of local businessman Micky Woodward, who began investing five years ago and now has a full-time squad, a wage budget of \u00a38,000 a week and annual bar takings of \u00a3750,000. The pitch is pristine, the ground a gleaming blue, and the club are second in the Conference, their highest position in their 115 years. It was enjoyable to stand close to the pitch, and the apartments that overlook one side offer individual charm. By the end of Red Eye, I was trying not to disturb the other four viewers with my laughter as Cillian Murphy's hilariously unscary terrorist had been reduced to croaking like a man in need of Lemsip rather than one hell-bent on murdering the heroine. It lacked the wit, even, of Cambridge United supporters singing 'What a load of rubbish!' to their own team. 1,543 turned up to see Grays win 5-3 and while it was hardly live theatre, it was certainly better than theme park cinema. Cinema 1, Football 1 Green Street at Castleford Cineworld, \u00a35.80 Sheffield Wednesday v West Ham, \u00a310 OK, cards on the table. I fully expected to enjoy the flicks more than a trip to watch the worst team in the Championship take on a second- or even third-string West Ham. I mean, be honest - would you bother buying tickets to see a star-studded production of Hamlet knowing the understudy's understudy will be performing on your night? Yet Hillsborough, I have to say, proved to be an absolute blast. The entrance fee was just \u00a310. A TENNER! I was so stunned the gate man had to call me back for my change from a \u00a320 note, some of which then went on a beer (\u00a32.20) and a burger (\u00a31.50). Fair play to West Ham, who entered into the spirit of things by conceding twice having gone 3-0 up, then allowing Wednesday to come within a crossbar's width of an equaliser before scoring a fourth. A big not-worthy also goes to the home fans for refusing to moan (even at three down) and sportingly applauding a spectacular Bobby Zamora volley that effectively ended the game as a contest. The only minus was the size of my seat. If I wanted to spend 90 minutes with my knees up around my ears I'd go pot holing in the Yorkshire Dales. As for the cinema? Well the film was enjoyable enough and leg room wasn't a problem - when you're one of three people inside a 260-seat arena, it tends not to be. But 29 minutes of adverts and previews is, in my book, 29 too many. Yes - my mobile phone is turned off. No - I'm not planning on making a pirate copy of the film, but thanks for asking. Yes - mention 'Orange Wednesdays' once more and I'm going to pre-empt Elijah Wood's downward spiral into football hooliganism by smashing up everything within a 200-yard radius. Just roll the bloody film! I would've killed time by helping myself to a second hotdog, had the first not set me back \u00a33.
