He had a 67 yesterday, four under, to share the Volvo Masters lead with his fellow Spaniard Jos\u00e9 Manuel Lara and give himself the chance to add to what is already an exceptional season. This year Garc\u00eda has won twice on the US Tour, two weeks ago he won the Mallorca Classic, and in the Ryder Cup in September he played way over his stature, physically and metaphorically. Altogether he has 11 wins worldwide in professional events and, incredibly, has 11 points from the 15 matches he has played in the Ryder Cup, 4 of them coming at Oakland Hills this year. He has already achieved a record that many professionals would be happy to accept at the end of their careers, and given that Vijay Singh has just had his year of years at the age of 41 there is no knowing what Garc\u00eda might do before he is finished. Yesterday firm fairways and a pesky breeze were only a little alleviated by soft greens. Only 12 of the top 54 golfers in Europe broke par and the 12 members of Europe's Ryder Cup team were a collective 22 over par, with only Garc\u00eda and Luke Donald, at four and two under respectively, breaking par. \"The real par,\" the Spaniard said afterwards, \"what with the wind and everything, was probably 73 rather than 71. It was a tough day; not easy to play out there.\" But it is in such conditions and on difficult courses such as this that Garcia feels most at home. As with all really talented professionals, he hates courses that are so easy that the tournament becomes a putting contest, with victory going to whoever holes the most that week. \"There are some courses,\" he said, \"where if you don't make every single putt you don't have a chance. At Valderrama if your ball-striking is good you can shoot a level-par round, maybe one under, something like that, and you're still in the tournament. I've always enjoyed that kind of play, like in the majors when they are playing tough.\" He has yet to win one of those, of course, but in what was a fine round yesterday two shots really stood out. Off the 8th tee, needing to keep the ball low under the wind and avoid trees on the left, he drew a two-iron round the corner of this 351-yard hole, leaving a straightforward 117-yard pitch which he almost holed. Another punch shot came into play at the 16th, where his drive left him needing to keep the ball low under some branches and fade it some 15 yards in the 150 yards he had left. He hit a wonderful little half-shot with a four-iron and fully deserved the birdie that came when he holed from 25 feet. \"Last year,\" he said, \"I had a similar shot and I hit it stiff. So the vibrations were good.\" Donald, two behind, is another good ball-striker but he needed a homeward half of 32, four under and joint best of the day with Lara, to counteract a poor front nine. At that point he was two over but he said: \"I knew that wasn't so bad. The breezes were tricky and par was a good score.\" The European Tour could hardly be less appropriately named, as the schedule for the 2005 season shows. The first tournament is in China, the second in Hong Kong and the third South Africa. Thereafter it visits, in successive weeks, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, California, Dubai and Qatar before finally making a European landfall in Madeira. Little wonder that Lara, who was hitherto a fringe tour player from Valencia but has just acquired a sponsor, says: \"The year starts with very, very long trips and, if you don't have someone supporting you, players get scared and wait for tournaments nearer home.\" There are no fewer than four events in China next year, the same number as in Scotland and two more than in Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
