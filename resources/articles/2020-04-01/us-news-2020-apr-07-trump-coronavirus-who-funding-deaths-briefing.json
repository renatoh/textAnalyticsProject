The US president contradicted himself within minutes, first vowing to put \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on his government\u2019s funding of the WHO, then insisting such a freeze was only under consideration. Trump\u2019s early inaction has come under renewed scrutiny in the past day after a New York Times report that Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade adviser, warned in a memo in late January that the virus could put millions of Americans at risk and cost trillions of dollars. Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, told the Washington Post that Trump\u2019s missteps \u201ccost tens of thousands of American lives\u201d. The president has repeatedly denied responsibility and sought to blame China, the Obama administration and the media. On Tuesday, with the US death toll exceeding 12,000, he unleashed a tirade at the WHO, even though it raised the alarm in January, after which he made statements downplaying it and comparing it to the common flu. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wrong about a lot of things,\u201d Trump said at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cAnd they had a lot of information early and they didn\u2019t want to \u2013 they seemed to be very China centric\u201d \u2013 implying that the WHO had toed the line of Beijing\u2019s early efforts to minimise the scale of the outbreak. Shaking his head peevishly, he added: \u201cThey called it wrong, they called it wrong. They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know. So we\u2019ll be looking into that very carefully and we\u2019re going to put a hold on money spent [sic] to the WHO. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we\u2019re going to see. It\u2019s a great thing if it works but when they call every shot wrong, it\u2019s not good.\u201d But soon after, Trump was asked if the middle of a pandemic was the time to suspend money for the WHO. \u201cNo, maybe not,\u201d he replied, backtracking from his earlier remark. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to do it but we\u2019re going to look at.\u201d A reporter interjected: \u201cYou did say that \u2013\u201d Trump retorted: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, I said we\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019re going to investigate it, we\u2019re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding, yeah, because you know what, they called it wrong, and if you look back over the years even, everything seems to be very biased toward China. That\u2019s not right.\u201d The WHO declared Covid-19 a public health emergency on 30 January, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d, and proclaimed: \u201cOne day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle - it will disappear.\u201d He eventually declared a national emergency on 13 March. Trump has long been sceptical about multinational organisations. In its most recent budget proposal, in February, his administration requested a reduction of the American contribution to the WHO from an estimated $122.6m to $57.9m. On Tuesday, the president also played down January and February memos from Navarro, saying he had not seen them at the time but did \u201cmore or less\u201d what his trade adviser suggested by imposing travel restrictions on China. (It was reported this week that nearly 40,000 people have flown from China to the US since the partial ban came into effect on 2 February.) He would not have wanted to act prematurely, Trump added, when it was not clear how bad the situation would become. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create havoc and shock and everything else. I\u2019m not going to go out and start screaming: \u2018This could happen, this could happen.\u2019 I\u2019m a cheerleader for this country.\u201d Meanwhile Wisconsin went ahead with an in-person primary election on Tuesday after Republicans and the US and state supreme courts blocked efforts to postpone it. Trump declined to criticise the move and claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting is rife with fraud. \u201cMail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they\u2019re cheaters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go and collect them, they\u2019re fraudulent in many cases, you gotta vote \u2026 The mail ballots are corrupt in my opinion.\u201d When it was pointed out that Trump himself used a mail ballot to vote in last month\u2019s Florida primary, he retorted: \u201cBecause I\u2019m allowed to. That\u2019s called out of state. You know why I voted? Because I happen to be in the White House and I won\u2019t be able to go to Florida and vote.\u201d Research has found that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. In the five states that have moved to an entirely vote-by-mail systems, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Sean Eldridge, the founder of the grassroots community organisation Stand Up America, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s baseless attacks on vote-by-mail are a pathetic attempt to suppress the vote in the middle of a national crisis. He is demanding that voters choose between protecting their health and participating in our democracy.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump himself voted absentee in the last two elections. His comments tonight show he is a liar and a hypocrite. Congress must intervene now to provide states with the resources they need to implement mail-in voting, online registration and expanded early voting.\u201d Evidence is also emerging that people of colour have been hit disproportionately hard by the virus for socioeconomic reasons and vulnerability due to underlying conditions. Black people make up a third of Louisiana\u2019s population but about 70% of the state\u2019s deaths. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the pandemic has shined \u201ca bright light\u201d on the racial disparities. \u201cWhen all this is over, and as we\u2019ve said, it will end, we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
