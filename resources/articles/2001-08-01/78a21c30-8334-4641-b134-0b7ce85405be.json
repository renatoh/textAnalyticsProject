A further cut to borrowing costs will be good news for Britain's 11m mortgage payers, and is likely to push up property prices, already rising at more than 10% a year. But while homeowners are still celebrating last week's unexpected cut in rates, new data suggests the economic outlook is darkening. Government figures re leased this morning are expected to confirm that manufacturing has suffered two quarters of falling output - the accepted definition of a recession. City analysts believe there is more pain to come for exporters as the world downturn gathers pace. \"We still think the worst of the industrial slowdown is yet to come as manufactured exports - which have held up surprisingly well so far - finally start to give way,\" said Jonathan Loynes, from Capital Economics. The global slowdown is no longer just a problem for manufacturing but has spread to the services sector which had been keeping the economy afloat, according to a business survey published last week. Service sector firms account for two-thirds of economic output. \"If [this] survey is right about services output, there is a good chance that overall GDP actually falls in the third quarter,\" said Mr Loynes. He predicts rates, which were cut last week to 5%, will reach 4.5% by the end of the year, their lowest level since 1963. The nine-year decline in unemployment which has taken the jobless figures to a 25-year low, could be ending, another survey published today suggests. Recruitment advertising is sliding at its fastest pace since the last recession, a sign that unemployment could be on its way up, according to figures from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. Its advertising index has fallen by nearly 20% over the past year, the fastest rate of decline since September 1991. Analysts watch the survey closely as the number of job advertisements is a leading indicator of the state of the labour market, and in the past similar slumps in recruitment have quickly been followed by rising unemployment. \"Forward looking indicators of unemployment do not make encouraging reading,\" said Ciar\u00e1n Barr, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. \"Any hint that a deteriorating labour market is eroding consumer demand will result in further monetary policy easing.\" A rise in unemployment could also threaten the property boom currently being fuelled by lower rates. House sales have dropped by more than a third over the past year, according to information group Experien, suggesting the housing market is about to run out of steam. The number of houses sold has declined during the past 12 months from 270,579 in the second quarter of 2000 to 175,244 in the first quarter of this year, and the trend is set to continue, according to the group. \"The decline in sales is affecting every section of the housing market and every area of England and Wales,\" said Bruno Rost, of Experian. \"It has yet to be seen whether this signals the beginning of a substantial downturn in house values, or a plateau in a generally upward market. \"But if combined with growing economic depression, job losses and declining corporate profitability, then it is highly probable that a period of subdued or reducing house prices is on the cards.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
