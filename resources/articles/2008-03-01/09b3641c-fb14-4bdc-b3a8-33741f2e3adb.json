From 1966 to 1968, and again in 1970, he lived the Vietnam war from the inside, sharing the conditions of soldiers and civilians, putting himself at immense personal risk. In 1971 he assembled his reportage into a book, with his own scathing captions, entitled Vietnam Inc, which played a key role in changing public perceptions of the conflict, especially in the United States. The level of impact the book had is indicated by Noam Chomsky's recent comment: \"If anybody in Washington had read that book, we wouldn't have had these wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.\" They needed also to read Vietnam at Peace, the follow-up 25 years later, exploring the legacy and how it takes another generation to begin the recovery. Jones Griffiths had a happy childhood as a native Welsh speaker in rural north Wales. He was born, one of three boys, in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, played prop forward in the rugby team, and was educated at local schools. It was typical of his modesty to regard reading pharmacy at Liverpool University as down to chance rather than ability. But that training stood him in unexpectedly good stead, providing a passport to work in the local chemist, and in obtaining his transfer to Boots in Piccadilly, London. There he found the opportunity to process customers' films and peruse the Photography Annual - and finally to engage in his vocation. He had already dabbled with wedding shoots and freelance submissions to the Rhyl Leader in the 1950s. At university, he contributed to the Manchester Guardian, and as a cameraman to Granada Television. At this stage he originated his own photo-stories, including one on English evacuees to Wales, and another on the dispossessed youth of an impoverished teenage generation. Significantly, he later told me: \"I got all that beautiful landscape stuff out of the way in north Wales and was ready for the rest of the world.\" By 1961, Jones Griffiths had met Ian Berry, the former Drum Magazine photographer and early Magnum member, and later started work with the Observer, building a fulltime career with the glossy magazines Town, Queen, Look, Life, McCalls, as well as the Sunday Times and New York Times colour supplements. He continued to freelance for the Guardian. He began to travel on assignments - from Northern Ireland to Rhodesia, Algeria to Israel, Zambia to Cambodia. And it was in Phnom Penh that he got a major break, photographing Jackie Kennedy on holiday. It made him enough to fund his whole Vietnam project. To Jones Griffiths, Vietnam was another country where \"a mechanised monster had despoiled an innocent landscape\". He related it to Goya's etchings in The Disasters of War; indeed, his hero Henri Cartier-Bresson - the man whose picture had first inspired the 16-year-old Jones Griffiths at the Rhyl camera club - later wrote: \"Not since Goya has anyone portrayed war like Philip Jones Griffith.\" His portraits of soldiers in action or, as often, at ease, have an insider's conviction. The result is a work of extremes in which horror alternates with humanity: the soldiers on the point of raping a Vietnamese girl or the wounded civilian so swathed in bandages her identification is reduced to a label reading \"VNC female\". In an interview last month, and in confirmation of his insider status, Jones Griffiths told me: \"I truly felt at home there, among family.\" Almost paradoxically, Jones Griffiths chose to live mostly in the US. It was a good professional base and he became Magnum president from 1980-85, the longest term ever served by a single member. At the time of his death he was fully engaged in fresh projects. He had settled in London and in addition to his Philip Jones Griffiths Foundation for the Study of War, there was his work on Cambodia, documented between 1973 and 1975, which he was again rediscovering. He was also enthusiastic over his visit last year to Damascus. And he had just completed a new book of Recollections, images of British daily life from the 1950s to the 1970s. In his mind, he repeatedly returned to Wales, that small country once so brutally colonised by the English that, he claimed, the experience helped him to identify with oppressed countries everywhere. Jones Griffiths never married - he regarded marriage as the \"bourgeois option\". He is survived by Fanny Ferrato and Katherine Holden, his daughters from two long-term relationships. Martin Woollacott writes: Travelling with Philip Jones Griffiths, as I did during a long trip to Vietnam and Camb-odia in 1980, was an experience at once exhausting and illuminating. Few western reporters had been to Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975, and hardly any had been allowed into Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge had been toppled by the Vietnamese. Philip's understanding of post-1975 Indochina was that the war might be over, but the crime continued. The deformed babies fathered by veterans exposed to Agent Orange, the crippled ex-soldiers in homes all over Vietnam, and the tragedy of Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, were all examples. His overarching subject was the terrible damage that had been done - damage for which the authors were still refusing to accept responsibility. He used to do a little sketch featuring an American general in a helicopter with an unctuous aide observing \"Fine day for bombing, sir\". That was the political and moral framework in which his extraordinary talent operated. Working with him, you were drawn into the mystery and ritual of his craft, beginning with the choice of film (neither too new or too old), the inviolate rules (a picture that had to be cropped was not worth printing) and ending with the intense scrutiny of the negatives. Every night, every single piece of camera equipment was laid out on the bed, disassembled, cleaned with little brushes, reassembled and repacked. Only then could we eat, or even talk. Every day, Philip's eye ranged the scene until he intuited some combination of landscape, people, light and meaning he wanted to capture. Sometimes he would seize it instantly; as often as not, he would wait for 10 minutes, even an hour. Philip had an anarchist's delight in authority flouted. Once, in the company of our interpreter and a communist official, we were watching a group of young Vietnamese women digging out a roadside ditch. \"Don't look disrespectfully at the foreigners,\" the official instructed the girls. One of them promptly deposited a spadeful of mud within a couple of centimetres of the man's polished shoes and said, \" Why not? We've got eyes, haven't we?\" Philip loved that incident, and the fact that he relished it so much told you volumes about him. \u00b7 Philip Jones Griffiths, photographer, born February 18 1936; died March 18 2008 \u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday April 1 2008.
