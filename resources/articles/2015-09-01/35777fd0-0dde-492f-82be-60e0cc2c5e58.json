Smooth South African Trevor Noah saunters into shot, smiling, while the show\u2019s trio of regular comedy sidekicks, Jessica Williams, Hasan Minhaj and Jordan Klepper, play around with a vuvuzela and some basic rugby terminology in a lame effort to ingratiate themselves with the new star. Noah reassures them: \u201cIt\u2019s still The Daily Show. Nothing is going to change.\u201d Across America and beyond, fans of the show share the nervousness of his co-stars. Is Noah a worthy replacement after 16 years with Jon Stewart in the hot seat? Can the new host deliver a similarly potent mix of smart and silly political lampooning? Noah\u2019s arrival at the show, which enjoys a devoted international following, was confirmed in March as Stewart prepared to step down from a role that had seen him followed as a guru for the politically educated tribes. By then, Noah had become a frequent contributor and had also appeared as a guest on the Jay Leno and David Letterman shows. All the same, the response from some regular viewers was bewilderment: the question \u201cTrevor who?\u201d trended on Twitter for a while. What is more, Noah\u2019s signing came just as the race for the White House was set to hot up. How will an outsider, Americans wondered, sense the subtle shifts in the mood of our nation? It is an apprehension that does not seem to shared by the 31-year-old comic. His customary shtick is cool and unruffled, so it is fitting he has prepared for his debut by honouring several commitments to appear at international venues, including a stint at the Edinburgh fringe last month. At the close of the new trailer, Noah corrects his fellow performers on their pronunciation of the word \u201czebra\u201d \u2013 shortening the first vowel sound. It all serves as a fitting taster for his brand of humour, where much of the comedy lies in the amused delineation of cultural difference. It is, after all, his birthright. Born in Johannesburg, he grew up in the township of Soweto and was brought up by his mother, Patricia, and his grandmother, Nomalizo, attending a private Catholic school in the city. Three years ago, he introduced himself to British audiences with a story about how, when he was a toddler, his mother had to drop his hand in the street whenever white people approached. She is a Xhosa-speaking black woman and he was termed \u201chalf-caste\u201d, having a Swiss father. Such intermingling of races was still illegal then (\u201cWhy half-caste anyway?\u201d Noah complains. \u201cWhy not twice as good?\u201d). At one point in his standup set, he regularly claimed that all he ever wanted was to be properly \u201cblack\u201d. Yet he also has fun with the notion that he wanted to get closer to his white, German-speaking father, inadvertently learning an overly emphatic version of the language from listening to recordings of Hitler\u2019s speeches. It is not surprising this performer is interested in cultural difference. It has marked out his life so far and is likely to prove key to his commentary on racial tensions in America. \u201cI\u2019ve lived a life where I\u2019ve never really fitted in,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cEven now, people still debate on what I am. People say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re black\u2019 and then someone will turn around and say, \u2018But he\u2019s not black, he\u2019s coloured.\u2019 And then coloured people will say, \u2018But you\u2019re not coloured.\u2019\u201d In 2009, Noah had to cope with the aftermath of a near-fatal gun attack on his mother. Her second husband \u2013 the father of Noah\u2019s two half-brothers \u2013 shot her twice, only stopping when his weapon jammed. The comic has since spoken of the incident in public to highlight what he sees as an endemic domestic abuse problem in the townships. Although pretty dramatic, Noah\u2019s life story is not yet very long. Indeed, his youthful race to fame has shocked some of those who have watched from the sidelines. \u201cAlthough he has made the US his base since 2011, and has worked really hard on the club circuit on both coasts he\u2019s not a household name in the way that Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais have become,\u201d says comedy critic Veronica Lee, who attended his recent Edinburgh show, during which he teased the lack of diversity in the almost uniformly white audience. For Americans, there is quite another appeal. Yes, Noah is African, but he sounds so different to African Americans \u2013 and he may also, Lee suspects, benefit from \u201ca faint association with Nelson Mandela \u2013 in popular terms the only South African the average American could name\u201d. The American television networks have developed a thing for foreign performers in recent years. The Scot Craig Ferguson recently completed a long and illustrious stint on CBS\u2019s The Late Late Show, while Birmingham-born John Oliver\u2019s regular appearances on The Daily Show have earned him his own HBO slot hosting Last Week Tonight and Londoner James Corden has just boosted ratings at the wheel of The Late Late Show. Noah is not only foreign, but black too. And yet, because he is not a woman, his appointment has gone down badly in some quarters of America, where female comics Tina Fey, Sarah Silverman and the two Amys, Poehler and Schumer, are all rightly judged A-list talent now. One of Noah\u2019s heroes is Richard Pryor, but he is nowhere near as wild. \u201cThe reality is that Noah has never been a shock comedian or a taboo buster,\u201d wrote Geoffrey York in Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper. \u201cHis act lacks the anger and outrage that often fuel Stewart\u2019s routines. He leaves his audiences feeling warm and content, rather than discomforted or challenged.\u201d In South Africa, Noah is an established figure with a track record as a TV presenter, with his own chatshow under his belt. His speedy international success has been tough for some other South African comedians to stomach. Experienced performer Mel Miller once suggested that young black comics \u201cmustn\u2019t come bitching about apartheid\u201d, while David Kau, another established standup, has sniped that he never need appear on American TV now since, thanks to Noah, most of his jokes already have. Watching Noah\u2019s show in Johannesburg in July, David Smith of the Guardian and Observer was impressed by his \u201ccharm and polish\u201d, as well as \u201chis surging self-confidence and his mercurial talent for accents, mimicry and physical comedy\u201d. Targets included South African call centres, Jacob Zuma\u2019s antics in parliament and the Fifa scandal. In the week of his appointment this spring, Noah had to face down a brief scandal of his own, albeit on Twitter. Some internet archaeology had unearthed a few yellowing tweets from 2012 that showed him poking fun at stereotypical Jewish financial acumen (in his defence, his mother has Jewish parentage), at white women\u2019s slight bottoms (\u201cA hot white woman with ass is like a unicorn. Even if you do see one, you\u2019ll probably never get to ride it\u201d) and even at domestic violence. He tweeted that December: \u201cOriginally when men proposed they went down on one knee so if the woman said no they were in the perfect uppercut position.\u201d Some called for The Daily Show to reconsider his appointment and the Guardian\u2019s comedy critic, Brian Logan, also took a fairly harsh line. Conceding that comedians should be allowed to function like \u201ccanaries in the mine, testing on our behalf what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s beyond the pale\u201d, he went on to argue this does not license them to say whatever they want. Twitter, he suggested, is \u201ca context-free zone\u201d and should always be handled with care. Suddenly, the stakes could not be higher for Noah. He will be playing on one of the world\u2019s biggest comic stages. But it seems that his mother can be relied upon to maintain his sense of perspective. When he told her he had got The Daily Show job, she pointed out that his 11-year-old brother had been made headboy at school: \u201cI\u2019m so happy \u2013 both my boys are doing big things.\u201d The Noah file Born Johannesburg, South Africa, on 20 February 1984, the \u201cillegal\u201d mixed-race son of Patricia, a Xhosa-speaker from Soweto township, and his Swiss father, Robert. Raised by his mother and grandmother, he attended the private Catholic school Maryvale College. His mother was jailed and fined over her relationship with his father. Best of times Hearing this spring that he had been chosen to take over from Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. Worst of times 2009, when his mother was shot twice by her second husband, Ngisaveni Shingange. His recent Twitter shaming over remarks in 2012 using racist, antisemitic and misogynist stereotypes was a minor blip in comparison. What he says \u201cYou just find a cliff and jump off, and you keep doing it, and if it works on a small cliff, then you move on to a higher one, and a higher one, and then finally you get to a big audience and you go, \u2018Fine, OK, I\u2019m happy with this material\u2019. So I do test it out on the audience and if it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. Crashing is part of flying, so\u2026\u201d What others say \u201cRare is the comic who can unite a diverse audience in laughter while making potentially divisive comments.\u201d Dominic Cavendish, Daily Telegraph critic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
