She refused to comment further. She had arrived from the Malaysian city of Kota Kinabalu, where she was detained, and will continue to the UK. The four, who include two Canadian siblings and a Dutch man, were found guilty of an \u201cobscene act\u201d by posing nude on the top of Mount Kinabalu, which has a spiritual significance for indigenous people. Pictures were posted on social media, causing a national uproar. Some Malaysians have suggested the act caused an earthquake that killed 18 people days later. The four were sentenced to a 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (\u00a3860) fine and three days in jail from the time of arrest, which meant they were free to go on the same day. Hawkins\u2019s lawyer said the group were ignorant of local customs and stripped off to \u201cchallenge each other\u201d at the top of the mountain. After her conviction, Hawkins\u2019s father, Timothy, said the sentence his daughter received was \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
