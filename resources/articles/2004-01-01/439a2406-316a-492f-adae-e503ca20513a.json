It was particularly agonising for Ritchie Foran, who made his debut for them on loan from Carlisle United. The controversial Foran was signed as a replacement for Julian Alsop, who is serving a five-match suspension. If anything, Foran has an even worse disciplinary record. He was recently convicted of threatening behaviour following his involvement in an incident last season in a Carlisle match - against Lincoln. Looking ahead to yesterday's match, he said: 'I do get frustrated sometimes. I am aggressive, but in a winning side I think you'll see that is controlled aggression and I won't lose my head.' He used it quite well, in fact, after coming on as a substitute against Lincoln after 66 minutes. He came agonisingly close to breaking the deadlock with a header that hit the woodwork. Nobody can have been surprised that Hull beat Darlington . Earlier this season, Hull fielded virtually a reserve team for their home LDV Vans Trophy clash with them, and were still good enough to send a full-strength Darlington crashing to a 3-1 defeat. On this occasion, Darlington faced them with the unenviable recent record of only one goal, and one point, from their previous five matches. Four of those games were lost 1-0, and it was the same story this time, with Stuart Elliott getting the only goal. The big surprise was Bury 's 2-0 win over Swansea City , which ended a run of nine successive defeats. Bury's caretaker-manager, Graham Barrow, was worried about Swansea striker Lee Trundle, the division's leading scorer. Recalling the Trundle performances he saw when the player was in local non-League football, Barrow said: 'He had lots of ability, but to be honest, I didn't think his career would take off like it has. He stands out as the player who is likely to pose the biggest threat to us.' However, Trundle did not score and Swansea's hopes of avoiding defeat were effectively swept away when Richard Duffy was sent off.
