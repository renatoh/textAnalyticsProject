The figures, which were prepared for a secret internal government review earlier this year, reveal a system in crisis as tens of thousands of women are reluctant to pursue their alleged attackers when faced with invasive disclosure demands, a lower likelihood of securing a conviction and lengthy delays in seeing their case brought to court. The report, which has emerged during an election campaign in which the Conservatives are making fighting crime a central tenet of their election strategy, suggests a lack of resources, owing to austerity, is impacting the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to pursue rape cases. Reported rapes are on the rise. However, police are referring fewer cases to the Crown Prosecution Service, which in turn is prosecuting even fewer cases. The highly sensitive data was assembled earlier this year by the prime minister\u2019s implementation unit as part of an urgent investigation into the dramatic fall in rape prosecutions in England and Wales. Rape prosecutions are at their lowest level in more than a decade. The briefing shows senior civil servants acknowledging the way the criminal justice system deals with crimes \u201cis particularly poor for rape\u201d and expressing suspicions \u2013 never publicly aired \u2013 that problems may be due to lack of resources. The document, marked as \u201cofficial \u2013 sensitive\u201d, notes: \u201cPolice are assigning certain unsuccessful outcomes after shorter investigations than in previous years.\u201d It also says: \u201cThe drivers for this are unclear, but it may be indicative of \u2018rationing\u2019 of police time and resources to more \u2018solvable\u2019 cases.\u201d While recorded rapes increased by 173% between 2014 and 2018, the police referred 19% fewer cases for charging decisions and CPS decisions to prosecute fell by 44% in the same period. One of the most concerning changes is the growing proportion of cases resulting in \u201coutcome 16\u201d, whereby a suspect has been identified after a police investigation but the victim does not support further action. The document reveals that from 2015 to 2018, the proportion of cases dropped owing to an outcome 16 rose from 33% to 48%. Last year, more than 20,000 women \u2013 an average of one every 30 minutes \u2013 decided not to proceed with a rape investigation, even when the suspect had been identified. Campaigners believe the sharp rise may reflect victims being discouraged from pursuing complaints because they face disclosure of their intimate, private life through requests for the contents of their phones and laptops. The sheer length of time from offence to completion at court, which has increased by 37% to an average of two years since 2014, may be deterring others. Claire Waxman, who is London\u2019s first victims\u2019 commissioner, said the figures highlighted significant problems in the way the criminal justice system deals with rape. \u201cThere is such inconsistency between police forces and areas over the way they handle rapes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did a survey in London with the Met of 500 cases and found that in 58% of them victims withdrew complaints. The main reason we are seeing that is [threats] to privacy from disclosure. People feel very pressured to consent. Victims don\u2019t want to share all their personal details even if it\u2019s only with the CPS and police. It\u2019s a risk they don\u2019t want to take.\u201d The report also reveals regional variations in accessing justice for rape victims. Figures show not a single police force in England and Wales has referred cases in line with the increases in recorded rape between 2014 and 2018. The lower number of cases referred to the CPS has been compounded by a further decline in the charging rate. The majority of CPS areas showed a decline in the charge rate for rape between 2014 and 2018. Overall 11 of 14 CPS areas showed significant falls in the rate of charging suspects and three \u2013 Wales, the south-east and east Midlands \u2013 showed increases. This effectively results in further variation in a victims\u2019 chances of seeing their case prosecuted. The review also shows the amount of time taken by the CPS to produce a decision on whether or not to charge a suspect has doubled since 2013-14, when it was on average 30.6 days, to 2018 when it reached 86.2 days. Katie Russell, a spokesperson for Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales, said: \u201cThe criminal justice process takes far too long and can be re-traumatising for those who\u2019ve already been subjected to the trauma of sexual violence or abuse. \u201cThere are wide disparities in the way sexual offences are handled in different areas. And perhaps most alarmingly, charging rates are declining despite numbers of reports to the police being at an all-time high. The bottom line is that only a tiny fraction of sexual offenders are being brought to justice and victims and survivors of these serious crimes are being failed.\u201d A legal challenge has been launched against the CPS over its failure to pursue rape cases after a collapse in rape charges. The challenge follows reporting of allegations by the Guardian that prosecutors have been advised to \u201ctake the weak cases out of the system\u201d, prompting concerns of a undeclared change in its approach to prosecution. A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cThe growing gap between the number of rapes recorded, and the number of cases going to court is a cause of concern for all of us in the criminal justice system. We consider every case referred to us by the police and the CPS will seek to charge and robustly prosecute whenever the legal test is met. \u201cMost CPS Area teams deal with multiple police forces and any variation in referral numbers will lead to differing charging rates. The cross-government review will explore the issue of regional variation and we are working with police to continue to improve how we manage these complex cases.\u201d The 24-page long \u201cend-to-end review of the criminal justice system\u2019s response to rape\u201d was circulated among cabinet, senior civil servants, senior police officers, prosecutors and victims\u2019 groups involved in the review, which is being coordinated by the Criminal Justice Board. The CJB is chaired by the justice secretary, now Robert Buckland QC, and brings together the home secretary, currently Priti Patel, law enforcement agencies and the senior judiciary. Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) lead for adult sex offences, said: \u201cEveryone with a role in investigating and prosecuting these crimes acknowledges there is more to be done in increasing the number of cases brought before the courts. \u201cOnce we understand what is causing these trends, we and our partners are committed to making real and lasting improvements across the whole system.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
