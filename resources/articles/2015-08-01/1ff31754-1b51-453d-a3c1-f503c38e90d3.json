There are a few more ties tomorrow, and the second round draw is on Thursday night. We\u2019ll be seeing more of each other later in this tournament I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s certainly been as eventful, and occasionally as slapstick, as you\u2019d expect from this stage. Goodnight, and thanks for reading! (PS - an epic shoot-out at Glanford Park has just been won by Barnsley, 7-6!) Meanwhile, York have beaten Bradford 4-2 on penalties and Rochdale have beaten Coventry 5-3 on penalties. Curtis Davies scores confidently for Hull; MATT CROOKS SKIES A RUGBY CONVERSION FOR ACCRINGTON AND HULL WIN 4-3! NO! He sends the goalkeeper the wrong way....but drags it wide! Gornell then converts for Accrington. 3-3, sudden death! Jakupovic saves again and now Hull have the advantage at 3-2. David Meyler can win it... Barnet have beaten Millwall 2-1. Shock! So it\u2019s 2-2 with two apiece to take. Akpom for Hull.... ......scores coolly, 3-2. Harry Maguire smashes it over the bar for Hull! 1-1! Then Josh Windass \u2013 son of Hull legend Dean \u2013 scores for the hosts! 2-1 after two apiece. Then Tom Huddlestone scores for Hull....and Jakupovic saves from Billy Kee! 2-2! Mingoia for Accrington...just under the goalkeeper Jakupovic and in...1-1. Shall we watch the penalties at Accrington together? Luer scores Hull\u2019s first, straight down the middle. 1-0! Carlisle have made it nice and safe against Chesterfield \u2013 Kevin Osei makes it 3-1 there in stoppage time. And that\u2019s full-time there now. Shock! Reading may well have pinched it at Colchester, which is cruel on the home side. Chris Gunter in the 115th minute... And Sevilla just came *so* close to levelling it at 5-5 in Tbilisi, but I think that\u2019ll be that...and indeed it is. What a game that was! Accrington v Hull goes to penalties too, after a 2-2 draw! Rochdale v Coventry, which has finished 1-1, will also go to spot kicks. Spot kicks at Spotland. York v Bradford will be resolved by penalties \u2013 2-2 full-time. Well, well, well. Penalties loom at the Wham! Oxford manager Michael Appleton after winning 4-0 at Brentford: \u201cWe knew we had to get off to a fast start and within 10 minutes the scoreline couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d Barcelona have scored! It\u2019s now 5-4 and it\u2019s Pedro, in perhaps his final game for the club, who snaffles up a rebound after yet another Messi free kick! Five minutes to go in Tbilisi! Goal at Carlisle! They now lead 2-1, Jabo Ibehre again, against a Chesterfield side that is down to 10 men. At this rate we now have four ties heading to shoot-outs... Colchester and Reading are still goalless, in case you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve not heard a peep from there. Sounds tight there, with half-time in extra time approaching. Hull have gone back in front at Accrington \u2013 a really good leap and header there from Greg Luer after a characteristically dangerous Elmohamady cross. Simon McMahon gathers himself to continue: \u201cEspecially after their keeper tipped one onto the underside of the bar before they broke and scored with the last kick. Football, eh? Bloody hell.\u201d I hope your drinks cabinet is well stocked. Joe Ludlam raises valid questions about both this MBM\u2019s popularity and Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s ability to count: \u201cYou did well to keep your money in your pocket, a deceptively high attendance of 14,000 at Hillsborough tonight. I\u2019ll check my account when I get home and make sure I didn\u2019t accidentally buy 5000 tickets instead of 5.\u201d I suspect Wednesday have won our little battle. Word Errr...WHAM! That was the noise Matt Crooks\u2019 header made as it plonked into the net from an accurate right-wing cross. Barnet have taken the lead at Millwall in the 102nd minute! Andy Yiadom from point-blank range! This, too, would be a shock. Ye gads, that\u2019s seven Championships sides out, most of them losing at home. I have received a piece of correspondence from Simon McMahon beginning with \u201cB\u201d and ending in \u201cS\u201d. But I\u2019m just glad he is still with us. That must have been a bit gutting. There are several games in extra time now (including, incidentally, the European Super Cup, which is incredibly 4-4), so we\u2019ll barrel on. Bit late to that amid all the fun, but: shock! Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday, Brighton, Exeter (shock-ish!), Wolves, Bury, Peterborough and Rotherham have all won too. I\u2019m hearing incredible rumours that Accrington\u2019s ground is now called the Wham Stadium. Now Burton are at it! Ben Amos\u2019 poor kick put Bolton under pressure but he couldn\u2019t do a lot about the shot, seconds later, from Matthew Palmer that deflected and flew to the wrong side of him. Could this be six Championship sides heading out? What a game! Hull have scored just inside extra-time at Accrington, Chuba Akpom scoring. Meanwhile Ipswich and Birmingham have both won, as have Charlton and Hartlepool. Shock! Wow! Walsall were clinging on, absolutely clinging on.....but suddenly they went down the other end, won a penalty and Bradshaw converts it for his hat-trick with the last kick of the game! Another shock! Shocks! Oh, what drama there! McPake converts a rebound at the very, very end gives Dundee the draw amid raucous scenes at Tannadice! The home fans look devastated! And Michail Antonio has made it 3-3 at Forest v Walsall! They\u2019ve come back from 3-1 down! And MK Dons have scored another late one, meaning they lead Orient 2-1! Carl Baker at the end! Accrington v Hull goes to extra time, it\u2019s 0-0 there. St Johnstone drew with Notts County. Bradford have equalised at the death at York through James Hanson, 2-2! And Brighton have won at Southend in injury time, via Kazanga Lua Lua! QPR have won 3-0 at Yeovil, and Sheffield United have won at Morecambe. But MK Dons have forced extra time against Orient \u2013 a Mathieu Baudry own goal makes it 1-1! First confirmed shock of the night. And Bury have nicked it at the death in Wigan! Leon Clarke makes it 2-1! Sheffield United appear to have stolen it late on at Morecambe \u2013 Neill Collins making it 1-0 at Morecambe. Stevenage aren\u2019t happy about that penalty incident.... Gillingham have scored another at Plymouth! Jake Hessenthaler at the far post, 2-1 to the Gills! Modou Sougou has put Mansfield to bed \u2013 4-1 to Wednesday there. Marcus Tudgay has equalised for Coventry at Rochdale. Emmanuel Dieseruvwe has equalised for Chesterfield at Carlisle. Bradley Dack has equalised for Gillingham at Plymouth. All of these are now 1-1 and extending the life of this blog. Confusion at Portman Road, when the linesman awards a penalty to Stevenage for a foul by Berra, but then has a long chat with the ref and it's reversed. Looked as if it would have been soft if given, to me. Did it cross the line? Didn\u2019t it? I think it did \u2013 Byron Moore converting from 10 yards and, while a defender got it out, it seemed to have just sneaked in. Another shock is on! Meanwhile, Michail Antonio has given Forest hope with a stunning goal \u2013 3-2 to Walsall. Mini-shock for York on the cards now \u2013 the League Two side beating League One Bradford 2-1 thanks to James Berrett. That should confirm the shock there! Sawyers with Walsall\u2019s third from a rebound. Greg Stewart has made it very interesting with a fine curler... Much more importantly, it is Plymouth 1-0 Gillingham. Craig Tanner in the 78th. So, it\u2019s now Barcelona 4-4 Sevilla! Yevhen Konoplyanka has tapped in to complete the turnaround from 1-4! You can check in with Jacob for that \u2013 link above. Ipswich have turned it around against Stevenage \u2013 Jay Tabb with a simple finish from a David McGoldrick assist. 2-1, blushes spared? Millwall have equalised against Barnet \u2013 it\u2019s Steve Morison. Charlton are 4-1 up on Dag &amp; Red, it\u2019s Reza Ghoochannejhad. Carlisle, of League Two, are beating League One\u2019s Chesterfield \u2013 Jabo Ibehre makes it 1-0. Hang on \u2013 Gill Swerts? Gill Swerts who played for Belgium and can also do this? Yes, \u2018tis he, playing for Notts County now. Bristol City have one back at Luton. Callum Robertson scores but they are 3-1 down. Ipswich knocking on the door against Stevenage \u2013 Chris Day, all 40 years of him, is thwarting them at Portman Road. 1-1. Meanwhile, Notts County\u2019s Gill Swerts has been sent off at Huddersfield, where the League Two side lead 2-1. I\u2019m hoping the excitement hasn\u2019t got to Simon McMahon. Dagenham &amp; Redbridge have one back at Charlton through Christian Doidge. And Sevilla have a penalty in the Super Cup...which is scored by Gameiro! 4-3 to Barcelona there! Birmingham have hushed Bristol Rovers\u2019 noise \u2013 Andrew Shinnie makes it 2-1 there. Fulham have taken the lead at Wycombe. And it\u2019ll be worth it just to hear Iain Dowie try and say \u201cKacaniklic\u201d again when describing the scorer. Ellis Harrison has made it interesting there.... The youngster is on fire here \u2013 that\u2019s two for him. Well then, Dundee taken apart on the counter straight after conceding and Spittal sidefoots home superbly! More from Joe Ludlam in Sheffield: \u201cNot a lot to report from Hillsborough other than a gentleman\u2019s agreement between both teams not to defend crosses. Wednesday are dominant but the game and both defences are enjoyably open.\u201d Jonathan Obika has pulled one back for Swindon against Exeter, so it\u2019s 1-2 there. The \u201cwell-travelled\u201d Leon Clarke has equalised for Bury at Wigan. What a finish from Spittal!! Lovely footwork on the edge of the box and an opportunistic toe-poke to set Tannadice alight! Bristol City look like crying the crocodile tears of a vanquished Championship outfit. Wolves have made their own turnaround against Newport \u2013 a Benik Afobe penalty for 2-1. Andrew, writing from Maine, says: \u201cListening online to Southend v Brighton. Sounds excruciatingly dull. Back to the scoreless Albion of last season. We do have a player called Bong though.\u201d The striker scores his second and turns this one right around the the League Two side! Goals everywhere now. Jacques Maghoma has made it Bristol Rovers 0-1 Birmingham. And in Tbilisi, a glimmer for Sevilla? Jose Antonio Reyes \u2013 remember him? \u2013 makes it Barcelona 4-2 Sevilla. Ipswich have equalised against Stevenage \u2013 young defender Josh Yorwerth with a header on his debut there. And it\u2019s Peterborough 2-0 Crawley, Marcus Maddison with that one. Hartlepool lead at Fleetwood through Billy Payner, and Zakaraya Bergdich has made it Charlton 3-0 Dag &amp; Red. That\u2019ll be that. Result of the night if it stays like this. The fourth was tucked away nicely from 10 yards by John Mullins. QPR have, I think, wrapped it up at Yeovil \u2013 it\u2019s 3-0 and it\u2019s a Nedum Onuoha lash into the roof of the net after a corner wasn\u2019t cleared. It is now Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 Mansfield, Kieran Lee with the goal. Simon McMahon senses blood! \u201cUnited looking livelier at the start of the second half, Rankin forcing a good save. A goal could be on the way ...\u201d Scunthorpe have equalised at Barnsley with the latest in this interminable sequence of penalties. A Paddy Madden penalty. Stat. St Johnstone have equalised against Ross County \u2013 the goal coming from Graham Cummins. It is now Barcelona 4-1 Sevilla. Your goalscorer: Luis Suarez. In case you\u2019re wondering, it is still Brentford 0-3 Oxford. Those three goals all came in the first 12 minutes! And Wigan have scored at the DW Stadium! Will Grigg from the penalty spot against Bury, to make it 1-0. It is also Scunthorpe 0-1 Barnsley, also from the spot. Josh Scowen scored this one. York have equalised at home to Bradford \u2013 a Luke Summerfield penalty. Except at Bolton, where it\u2019s half-time and goalless. Nothing that\u2019s happening in these games so far really changes the view that you can\u2019t really read anything into them. But let\u2019s think positively: how is the game you\u2019re watching going? Is your team tumbling out? Craig Noone has scored for Cardiff \u2013 they lead AFC Wimbledon 1-0. And it\u2019s goalless at half-time in the Dundee derby. Maybe not so lively at Wycombe then.... The former Ipswich striker has put the Hatters ahead against the Championship side. And it\u2019s Rochdale 1-0 Coventry \u2013 a belter from Donal McDermott. Sounds lively at Wycombe v Fulham but it\u2019s still goalless. Hull still goalless at Accrington too. A goal at Rotherham on the stroke of half time though, Jordan Bowery making at 1-0 against Cambridge. And Mansfield have one back at Hillsbrough! Ryan Tafazolli makes a game of it. Parity for the men from League Two. Still looking fun at Tannadice; Dundee just whizzed a fizzing cross across goal but nobody was on hand to convert. But Barcelona are now 3-1 up against Sevilla \u2013 Rafinha. Oh, and Exeter are 2-0 up at Swindon in our League One v League Two mini-shock. That one was scored by David Wheeler. Charlton are 2-0 up over Dag &amp; Red \u2013 Karlan Ahearne-Grant from the edge of the box. Another own goal from a Championship defender. At the moment you\u2019d think none of these clubs wanted a long cup run. Joe Ludlam is at a game! \u201cI\u2019m at Wednesday-Mansfield, and have also viewed your report. That\u2019d be a score draw as far as your target goes, except that I\u2019ve got four friends with me and not one of them has had their phone out yet. Crowd is pretty thin, despite a healthy showing in the Mansfield end. Put your money on the MBM hit counter.\u201d At the moment my money\u2019s staying in my pocket. Ooooh, that\u2019s a bad miss from Bolton\u2019s Gary Madine, fluffing a header just five yards out against Burton. Still goalless in the 8pm kick-off. Exeter lead at Swindon, which goes down as a surprise. Alex Nicholls with the goal. Huddersfield have become another of those rare beasts \u2013 Championship teams in the lead. Murray Wallace has scored against Notts County: 1-0. Ipswich have an abysmal record in this competition of late. This would be five consecutive exits to lower-league teams in a row. Dean Gerken parried Dean Parrett\u2019s shot, but right against the shins of Christophe Berra. In it went. Tyler Walker has scored for Nottingham Forest! It\u2019s Forest 1-2 Walsall. Doesn\u2019t matter who scored the last one, because Tyrone Barnett has definitely put this one away! A left-foot lash inside the near post, and the shock is back on. Blackburn have equalised against Shrewsbury \u2013 looked like a Nathan Delfouneso header but could have been an own goal. Luis Suarez has just had a goal disallowed for Barcelona, presumably because it wasn\u2019t a direct free-kick. Blackpool, those paragons of stability, are 3-0 down at Northampton now. Sam Hoskins did the business. Stevenage have apparently started well at Ipswich. Meanwhile, Tony Watt has made it Charlton 1-0 Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. All of which means none of those shouty goal updates from me for a while now, after that early rush. A quiet minute or two, now....although Northampton are now 2-0 up over Blackpool, Dominic Calbert-Lewin with the second. That\u2019s sensitive information. Bradford lead at York. Jose Semedo has put Sheffield Wednesday two up over Mansfield, so that one might be done and dusted 19 minutes in. Northampton lead Blackpool through Chris Hackett. And J.R. has just seen Jay Emmanuel-Thomas make it Yeovil 0-2 QPR. Nice far-post finish from him. J.R. in Illinois is keeping it real (ish): \u201cHere in the U.S. the Capital One Cup game they are televising is Yeovil Town versus Queens Park Raisins. Of my own free will, and with no particular interest in either team, I have chosen to watch the game at Huish Park instead of the UEFA Super Cup. What do you make of that? \u201c(OK, bit of a confession. Got the Super Cup up on the computer and keeping half an eye on it. Messi with two brilliant free kick goals to Banega\u2019s one in the first sixteen minutes. The skill level in that game seems to be a bit higher than the one at Yeovil)\u201c More from Simon McMahon at Tannadice: \u201cVery open start at Tannadice, real end to end stuff here, Nick. Dundee have had the best chance and look dangerous, but have been forced to make an early change. Wouldn\u2019t like to be making any predictions about how this one will end.\u201d Tallies with what I\u2019m half-watching \u2013 good tempo to the game there. In the other SPL match, Craig Curran has just put Ross County a goal up at St Johnstone. In Tbilisi, Lionel Messi has just scored ANOTHER free-kick and it\u2019s now Barcelona 2-1 Sevilla, all three goals coming from direct free kicks in the first quarter-hour! In Wolverhampton, it\u2019s now Wolves 1-1 Newport thanks to Nouha Dicko. Eventful start to this evening, eh? QPR have taken the lead at Yeovil. Their striker, Sebastian Polter, bustled down the left and squeezed a shot just under the home goalkeeper. Tom Bradshaw scores for the League One side, and it would currently be quicker to list the Championship sides that aren\u2019t losing at home. Sheffield Wednesday have just scored against Mansfield, mind you \u2013 big-money signing Lucas Joao makes it 1-0. Errrm, right. This was a cracking strike from 45 yards by Kemar Roofe, reacting to a header out from the home goalkeeper Jack Bonham and whacking it into the vacant net! Crikey. Dundee just had a great chance at Tannadice, home \u2018keeper Zwick forced into a sharp double save. And Barnet lead at Millwall with a John Akinde penalty. Was this a smart idea? Catastrophic from Brentford, who concede another with a bizarre ricochet off Danny Hylton. Like that one \u2013 James Collins with a cool finish from a rebound in a deserted-looking Griffin Park. I think what we\u2019ll do tonight is make big deals of goals like this, that look shock-worthy, and selected others. Barcelona have equalised in Tbilisi and we\u2019re just seven minutes in! It\u2019s Lionel Messi, and it\u2019s also a luscious free-kick. Peterborough, in fact, may have struck a few seconds before that \u2013 taking the lead against Crawley through Conor Washington. A sharp finish from the edge of the box by the League Two side\u2019s Liam Sercombe at Griffin Park! Sevilla have taken the lead against Barcelona! A luscious Ever Banega free-kick. Simon McMahon writes in from Tannadice: \u201cCracking atmosphere at a packed Tannadice for tonight\u2019s Dundee derby. Come on United!!!\u201d Cracking stuff Simon, keep us posted. I can see Dundee making the very early running on my screen. They\u2019re underway in Tbilisi and about to get underway in Dundee, so I\u2019ll bet most of our cup ties are underway too... A reminder: do write or tweet in. Your Capital One Cup first round experience should be a shared experience. Strong-looking Hull side at Accrington: If you\u2019re supporting, say, a Championship team tonight, how important is this game to you? Bothered? Completely under your radar? Excited that it\u2019s possible to get quite a long way in this tournament with little let or hindrance, should you apply yourselves properly, and get yourselves a genuine shot at Wembley? Or are you more concerned with scraping \u00a314m together for James Vaughan, or whatever the latest nonsense is. So...errrr.....this has happened: Do you have Georgia on your mind? In that case, the road leads back to Jacob Steinberg\u2019s MBM of Barcelona v Sevilla in the European Super Cup, taking place in Tbilisi. You are allowed to keep both windows open at once. We have a correspondent At The Game. Ipswich\u2019s team to play Stevenage. This is a team sheet for Colchester v Reading. Another bit of fun team news! The Tyler Walker in question is the son of Des. Bit of team news from what we\u2019ll grandiosely call one of our \u201cfeatured games\u201d. Tonight\u2019s games all kick off at 7.45pm, by the way. Except for Bolton v Burton, which starts at 8pm. If that one goes into extra time then \u2013 not gonna lie \u2013 I\u2019m promising you nothing. On which subject \u2013 that serves as clarification that tonight\u2019s cup ties do indeed go straight to extra time and, if necessary, penalties if they\u2019re level after 90. Are you? Let\u2019s hope so, because there are 32 (thirty-two) items Capital One Cup ties afoot this evening and we, reader, are about to commence a wild rodeo ride through the tournament\u2019s badlands \u2013 a wild place, populated by very few, where literally anything might happen. That\u2019s not untrue, because shocks \u2013 such as they are \u2013 are very common at this stage due to the number of players rested, the rattly emptiness of some of the bigger clubs\u2019 stadia and, dare one suggest it, an early-season drop in intensity from those who feel they ought to be somewhere else. So it\u2019s hard to confidently call too many of this evening\u2019s games, even if the reverse might seem true on paper. You can see a full list of tonight\u2019s matches here. But here are some of the chewier bits of marshmallow in tonight\u2019s rocky road: Yeovil v QPR \u2013 A Championship fixture two seasons ago; now League Two meets newly-relegated-from-Premier-League. What could possibly go right? Wycombe v Fulham \u2013 Well-managed League Two play-off final tragics host possibly-getting-their-act-together-but-it\u2019s-early-days Championship outfit. Port Vale v Burnley \u2013 Burslem meets Burnley in an acid test of whether Sean Dyche and co really want anything more than instant promotion. Accrington Stanley v Hull \u2013 For similar reasons to the above, minus the assonance and Sean Dyche. Ipswich v Stevenage \u2013 Teddy Sheringham bats for an upset against Mick McCarthy, who helpfully announced his starting lineup yesterday. Wigan v Bury \u2013 Because it sounds like a local derby, so I\u2019m sure the DW Stadium will be packed out. There are also a couple of games in Scotland. St Johnstone play Ross County and, perhaps more excitingly, there\u2019s a Dundee derby! It\u2019s at Tannadice between Dundee United and Dundee, and we\u2019ll be keeping you abreast of that. There we go. I\u2019m aiming for this blog to get more hits than there are paying spectators at \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 Sheffield Wednesday v Mansfield, so let\u2019s help each other towards that aim. If you\u2019re at a match tonight, let me know which one, how it\u2019s going; tell me a story, send me a picture. Let\u2019s interact. Nick will be here shortly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
