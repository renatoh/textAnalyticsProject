Moore's decision to play for Australia in the Olympics instead of his club in the first leg against CSKA, which Rangers lost 2-1, was resented by many fans. McLeish stripped him of the captaincy and put him on the transfer list. McLeish refused to confirm Moore's return yesterday, but the Australian is likely to be called upon as Rangers need to rejig their defence to allow the right-back Fernando Ricksen to fill in for the midfielder Alex Rae, who is suspended. \"Craig Moore is fine,\" McLeish said. \"He is 100% fit, has played in some games in Athens and has had some sharp tests against some quality players. \"I don't want to get involved in the Moore issue and I'm keeping my cards close to my chest. But I think whoever plays for Rangers should get 100% backing from the crowd because it's a night when we need them more than ever.\" McLeish has also asked fans to be patient if his team do not go out with all guns blazing as they have to be careful not to concede. \"We certainly don't want to play a scared game but we will be disciplined,\" he said. \"If we get an early breakthrough then great but if it takes us the entire 90 minutes - or 120 - we are prepared to do what we have to do to get through.\" Dragan Mladenovic, the summer signing from Red Star Belgrade, is in contention for a place in the starting line-up after making his long-awaited debut against Hibernian at the weekend. The 20-year-old winger Chris Burke, however, remains sidelined by the virus that saw him collapse in the first game of the season, the 0-0 draw at Aberdeen on August 7. He has not played since and has lost four kilograms. McLeish said: \"He has been given a special course of vitamins and iron to improve the minerals in his body, which will help him get his strength back. The virus has hit him hard and we have to be careful with him.\" Rangers (4-4-2, probable): Klos; Moore, Khizanishvili, Boumsong, Vignal; Arveladze, Ricksen, Hughes, Lovenkrands; Novo, Prso. CSKA Moscow (4-4-2, probable): Akinfeyev; V Berezutsky, Ignashevich, A Berezutsky, Rahimic; Gusev, Aldonin, Jarosik, Zhirkov; Olic, Vagner Love."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
