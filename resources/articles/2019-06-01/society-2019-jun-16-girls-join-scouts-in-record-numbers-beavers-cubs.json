Among them is nine-year-old Florence Cooper-Seel, who joined the group this year because she loves the outdoors and sleepovers. It is her first night away from home so she is nervous, as are her fathers Andy and Nigel. \u201cI woke up soaking because I\u2019d slept against the side of the tent,\u201d Florence says afterwards. Cub scouts are made of stern stuff, though, and the next day they went hiking, played dodgeball and at night sang songs round a campfire, toasting marshmallows and chocolates on sticks. \u201cI did miss my family but I made loads of new friends,\u201d she says. A boys-only club for decades, it\u2019s now girls like Florence who are shaping the scouts\u2019 future \u2013 joining at a rate six times faster than boys. A record 187,000 girls have swelled the ranks of beavers, cubs and scouts \u2013 nearly a third of members \u2013 and there is a waiting list of thousands more. It was only 12 years ago that the scouts made it compulsory to accept girls. For Florence\u2019s fathers, the scouts was a deliberate choice. \u201cWe don\u2019t like the idea of gender segregation,\u201d Nigel says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen in the real world. We gave her the choice, but Florence said she wanted to go to a club with girls and boys.\u201d Chief scout Bear Grylls says people who only know the scouts of old would be surprised by how much it has changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since Scouting for Boys,\u201d he says. The big influx of girls is partly because scouting is now basing itself in community centres and schools, he says, where its new mantra of \u201cdiversity is our strength\u201d is seen as much more inclusive. \u201cWe\u2019re going to where young people already are. We don\u2019t expect them to come to us,\u201d Grylls says. That is exactly how it works at Brookhouse primary school in Blackburn, where Nisbah Hussain set up the community\u2019s first scout group five years ago. She knew little about scouts but had heard the organisation was becoming more welcoming. Hussain was desperate, she says, to set up something that could be a hub for young Muslim families in the community \u2013 a place where children could come together and have \u201creal outdoorsy adventures\u201d. \u201cThere are lots of things you can\u2019t teach kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to learn it from experience.\u201d Scouts certainly weren\u2019t on the radar of most Muslim people because it was regarded as an organisation for white middle-class boys. But once families realised it was open and affordable \u2013 they charge \u00a32.50 a week \u2013 children came in great numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s a collective feeling that we\u2019re bringing up our kids together,\u201d Hussain says. Girls have been the revelation, though. Hussain says they make up more than 70% of members, and there\u2019s a waiting list that would double their size. \u201cWe\u2019re really girl-heavy. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says, as she rattles off the list of activities on offer, from axe-throwing to rifle-shooting and trekking. \u201cBut it\u2019s always the girls first at it.\u201d Hussain believes scouts have made the whole community more sociable and cohesive. It is having an impact on school life too, she says. \u201cThe teachers tell us it\u2019s really obvious which children go to scouts because they\u2019re more independent and very good at problem solving.\u201d CJ Ledger, a mother of two and a scout leader in Ashford, Middlesex, says scouting had to move with the times or fade into obscurity. A girl guide as a teenager, she believes that the \u201cwild child\u201d outdoors ethic of scouting is what gives it the edge over girl guides and brownies. \u201cIn a society which is so risk-averse, I think scouting gives kids a chance to do things their parents probably wouldn\u2019t allow them to do \u2013 but in a safe environment,\u201d she says. Girl guiding is still Britain\u2019s biggest youth organisation for girls, with around 400,000 members, according to Ruth Marvel, the group\u2019s deputy chief executive. But numbers are down on last year, and about half of what they were in the 1970s heyday. Marvel says that this is more to do with a shortfall of volunteers and less about the rising popularity of scouts. But she concedes that the guides movement has to evolve to stay relevant. To that end it recently asked 70,000 of its guides to identify the issues they cared about most. \u201cThey told us about gender stereotyping and gender discrimination all the way through to animal rights and the environment. So we have taken that on board,\u201d she says. And there are new badges for skills such as vlogging, aviation and campaigning. But would the guides consider the ultimate update and allow boys in? \u201cIt\u2019s something we think about quite a lot,\u201d says Marvel. But when it was put to the members, she says, the overriding response was that they value their \u201cgirls-only\u201d space. \u201cWhat we offer is more relevant than ever in terms of giving girls opportunities to genuinely explore who they are and what they want to be, and without having anyone telling them that that\u2019s not OK,\u201d she says. Facts and figures \u2022 Scouts were founded in 1907; today there are 640,000 in the UK and 50 million globally \u2013 making it the world\u2019s largest youth movement \u2022 In 2019 there are 451,555 boy and 187,243 girl scouts \u2022 The number of girl scouts has risen by 18,499 from 2017 and boy scouts by 3,063 \u2022 There are 160,000 adult volunteers, from scout leaders to minibus drivers \u2022 Barack Obama, David Beckham, Paul McCartney, the Duchess of Cambridge, Richard Branson and Jamie Oliver were all scouts \u2022 11 of the 12 people to walk on the moon were scouts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
