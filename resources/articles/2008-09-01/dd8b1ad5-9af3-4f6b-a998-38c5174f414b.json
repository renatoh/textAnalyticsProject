When I did my weekend late show on local stations in the north, the comedian Michael McIntyre, who was a studio guest, said that I reminded him of Alan Partridge. I explained how Steve Coogan was born and brought up just a few streets away from me in Manchester, and his accent, allied to his skill in catching those little radio intonations, meant that our voices sounded very similar. \"No, not the voice,\" said McIntyre, \"the whole thing.\" You live with it. It is Coogan's genius to have created a character only a tad away from reality, and if you can retain just a glimmer of blue sky between yourself and Norfolk's early morning chief of chat, that is a result of sorts. We all have Partridge moments, however, which thankfully in the days before YouTube and social networking sites were private grief into which few got the chance to intrude. No longer. Now, if you open your mouth before an open microphone and put your foot in it, the world can be listening within minutes, as BBC WM's Les Ross knows to his cost. For those yet to hear Ross's interview on Birmingham's morning show with the author and comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli, all you need to know is that it is a woefully under-researched five-minute piece on local radio down an ISDN line with some guy off the telly who has written a book that the presenter has not read. You can probably hear half a dozen of them any morning you switch on your BBC local. What lifts it out of the rut is that Kohli, who is a charming, witty man (and occasionally writes for this newspaper, but that is not why I am saying it), is clearly not having any. After enduring a couple of minutes of banalities, he says: \"This is not working for me,\" and excuses himself. The old interview walkout, always good for a laugh. Ross, it should be said, is a very good disc jockey, a legend even in the West Midlands - if playing gramophone records and making a few jokes entitles you to legendary status. He made his name as an off-the-wall breakfast host on Birmingham's commercial stations - he probably had a car at one stage with his name on the side - where, as is the nature of the beast, it was all about Les. When he reached an age where wackiness was no longer exactly comme il faut, Ross and the BBC will have fallen conveniently into each other's arms, they in the hope of stealing a few Rajar points, he for a surprisingly large amount of money. Problem is, the kind of ego-driven presenting on which Ross built his career does not fit in when you are on a conveyor belt getting your 10 minutes with an author down the line from London, which happens an awful lot on BBC local radio. Only this week, I heard two stations trumpeting the fact that Sheila Hancock would be \"in the studio\", neglecting to mention the studio was in London, and she would be trotting out rehearsed answers about her latest volume of memoirs. It is asking for trouble to hire someone such as Ross and expect him to stick to this careworn formula. So, hard lines Les. I feel you took one for the team, so it is only fair I share my favourite - happily pre-YouTube - Partridge moment. I was presenting an evening show across several northern local radio stations, combining news and sport. My guest was the former Liberal MP Michael Meadowcroft, newly returned from former Yugoslavia, where he had been advising on how democracy could be brought to the region. Alongside my conversation with Meadowcroft, I was to take regular reports from numerous midweek football matches across the north. While I was lining up the football reports, I half-listened to the internationally renowned expert on democracy explaining how unstable the situation is in the Balkans, and how it was essential for the future of Europe that a lasting peace was achieved. \"The Balkans,\" he said, \"is where the flame was lit that ignited the Great War, and it is no exaggeration to say that if we do not get this right, it could lead to a confrontation from which the world might not recover.\" To which I responded with the immortal words: \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to interrupt you there, there's been a goal at Chesterfield.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
