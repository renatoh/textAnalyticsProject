Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Kusnirova, were found shot dead in their home last weekend in a killing that police have said is likely to have been related to his investigative work. The summary, published by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), focuses on the alleged activities in Slovakia of people associated with the Italian organised crime group \u2019Ndrangheta. Entitled The Model, the Mafia and the Murderers, it was jointly published with the Czech Centre for Investigative Journalism (CCIJ), the Investigative Reporting Project Italy, and Aktuality.SK, a team of investigative reporters in Slovakia with whom Kuciak was working when he was killed. The report describes how the project began with an investigation into why the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, hired M\u00e1ria Tro\u0161kov\u00e1, a then 27-year-old former topless model and Miss Universe contestant, as one of his assistants despite what it described as her relative lack of political experience. \u201cHis press department had refused to release her job description, to clarify her position in government, or to say whether she got a security clearance,\u201d the summary said. The investigation took a dramatic turn after it emerged that Tro\u0161kov\u00e1 had been a business partner of Antonino Vadala, 42, an Italian living in Slovakia with alleged close ties to the \u2019Ndrangheta. According to the report, in 2001 Italian police issued a warrant for Vadala\u2019s arrest after wiretaps caught him discussing the logistics of hiding a fugitive drug trafficker and killer in his home in Calabria. The charges were dropped, however, after Vadala avoided arrest, having already moved to Slovakia. According to reports in the Slovakian press, Vadala has not responded to requests for comment. A CCIJ reporter who knew Kuciak told the Guardian the investigation revealed that Italian organised crime members had \u201centered into business with regional politicians\u201d, forming what was effectively a mafia syndicate. The investigation was about to enter what Kuciak regarded as the \u201cdangerous phase\u201d, as he and colleagues from the CCIJ based in Prague were preparing to confront the key players. This hadn\u2019t happened at the time of Kuciak and Kusnirova\u2019s killings in their home in Vel\u2019k\u00e1 Ma\u010da, 40 miles (65km) east of Bratislava. Kuciak focused mainly on tax evasion stories for Aktuality.sk and had been investigating the suspected theft of EU funds destined for eastern Slovakia by the Italian mafia. The shootings have shocked the central European nation, with Andrej Kiska, the Slovakian president, saying he was left \u201cshaken and terrified\u201d by the \u201ccold-blooded murder\u201d. A group of Slovakian editors-in-chief said the murder was \u201cdirected against the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to control the powerful and those who violate laws\u201d. Culture minister Marek Madaric, who is a member of Fico\u2019s party, resigned on Wednesday, telling reporters: \u201cAfter what has happened, I cannot imagine just calmly sitting in my minister\u2019s chair.\u201d Fico, however, warned at a press conference on Tuesday against the \u201cpolitical abuse of a tragedy\u201d, after opposition politicians alleged that members of his ruling party were linked to the killings. In response to questions about the associations of members of his inner circle, Fico did not mention Tro\u0161kov\u00e1 by name, but warned the press not to jump to conclusions. \u201cYou are connecting innocent people to a double murder. That\u2019s crossing the line.\u201d The prime minister drew condemnation for what one journalist described as a \u201cvulgar\u201d publicity stunt during the conference, as Fico, the interior minister, Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k, and the president of the police, Tibor Ga\u0161par, stood next to an ornate table bearing large bundles of cash guarded by a masked and armed police officer: the \u20ac1m (\u00a3880m) reward Fico has promised for information leading to the arrest of the killers. Filip Struh\u00e1rik, an editor at the daily Denn\u00edk N, criticised Fico for implying that he had taken personal control of the investigation. \u201cCash on the table is one thing,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201cbut it is also weird for him to say \u2018we\u2019 are investigating this, \u2018we\u2019 have this hypothesis, \u2018we\u2019 are pursuing these lines of inquiry. There is no \u2018we\u2019; this needs to be an independent investigation, especially when members of the prime minister\u2019s own office have been linked to these stories about the Italian mafia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
