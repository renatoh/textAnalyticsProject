In that time he has seen council support and funding ebb away, as poverty and deprivation among the families his school serves has grown. The result is that the needs of his pupils have become greater, but he worries that as cuts bite he will be able to help them less. Downshall (motto Dream, Persevere, Succeed) is a large, popular primary school serving a mixed, disadvantaged community. On Tuesday morning, the children are playing boisterously in the playground. The rain has held off, toys are scattered and sunflowers are growing apace in their pots. The school is rated \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted, praised particularly for the way in which it nurtures all aspects of pupils\u2019 development. The children are predominantly from minority ethnic backgrounds with 3% white British pupils and they make strong progress in their time at Downshall. Behind the scenes, however, the school is struggling to make ends meet. \u201cInitially when I started here there was strong council support,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cThere were very good systems in place to support the school with development, special needs, safeguarding and curriculum.\u201d But with government cuts to council funding and growing pressure on education budgets, Bennett is being forced to axe what he regards as vital services, in particular the pastoral care team that supports the neediest children, enabling them to cope with their anxieties. It was the school\u2019s lead pastoral care worker, Amanda Redmond, who put in the application to BBC Children in Need, with Bennett\u2019s support. She\u2019s now scrutinising the Turn2us charity website to see if there are more bids she can make. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cWe so desperately need pastoral care in this school, with all the social issues and the asylum seekers. We desperately need to keep the team together to make sure these children get the support they need.\u201d She describes the sort of challenges facing some of the children she works with in the school. \u201cWe have a young man whose grandfather was shot dead abroad. He could not cope with that. He was angry. He would not stay in class. He was running around the playground crying. \u201cI picked him up and worked with him. We did a bereavement book. He still has his moments but he is back in class learning and meeting his expectations,\u201d says Redmond. Bennett adds: \u201cHe probably would\u2019ve ended up excluded without that help.\u201d Other children struggle with the effects of parental drug abuse, domestic violence and unstable, overcrowded housing. \u201cIt petrifies me,\u201d says Redmond. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to those children? They desperately need extra support.\u201d Bennett agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s very shortsighted to cut back on schools because it will come back to bite everybody. We have to go the extra mile for those who have not had the best start in life. Once they get to secondary it\u2019s so much harder.\u201d A spokesperson for Redbridge council said: \u201cWe have considerable sympathy with the views expressed by Ian Bennett. The government has progressively reduced the funding available for local authorities to support schools and this has meant that authorities have either had to concentrate increasingly limited resources on those schools that need the help the most or trade services to schools. \u201cWe believe that this policy is shortsighted and it is to the credit of Redbridge schools that they have maintained such high standards in an increasingly difficult funding situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
