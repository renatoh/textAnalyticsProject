Never mind piffling about with surveys on staplers and whose turn it is for the tea round. This week we're getting serious, starting with the new personal profile tool at jobsite.co.uk. This nifty online questionnaire miraculously revealed what I have always believed: it's not me who's annoying, it's my colleagues. Based on something called \"Gravesian psychology\", which may or may not turn out to be totally made up, the questionnaire will tell you whether you are a Contender, a Supporter, a Balancer, a Believer or a Survivor - and, more importantly, precisely why you find your colleagues infuriating. Sadly, however, with only five personality pigeonholes, there's simply no room for Dave from IT (a Bore), Sally from downstairs (a Nasty Gossip) or Jane, your line manager (an Egomaniac Workaholic). But we expect you get the general idea. \u00b7 Next up on the science front, there's great news from somebody called David Kirsch. Apparently, Kirsch has just launched a new product called Hoodia Supreme. Naturally, my initial thought was that this must be part of Tony Blair's grand plan to put Respect at the centre of our national life (Granny Giles: \"Don't come a step nearer, young man, I've got Hoodia Supreme!\" Young Man: \"Aaghh!\"). So you can imagine my surprise on discovering that Hoodia Supreme is, in fact, a diet aid that claims to help you \"Beat Hunger, Burn Fat, Stay Energised and Focused\". Just what I need for those slow, post-blowout-lunch afternoons at my desk. Although I loved the slogan, I was slightly disturbed to read that side-effects can include \"mild aphrodisiac and anti-depressant qualities\". All good things in themselves, I'm sure ... \u00b7 I'd much rather be scoffing biscuits than diet pills (and yes, it shows), but astoundingly it seems I haven't been scoffing biscuits properly. McVitie's has just employed Muryel Boulay as chief bescoitier, whose job will be to instruct us in the dark arts of dunking and dipping. Her first task in the job has been to launch a booklet entitled \"How to Eat a Biscuit\". Crumbs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
