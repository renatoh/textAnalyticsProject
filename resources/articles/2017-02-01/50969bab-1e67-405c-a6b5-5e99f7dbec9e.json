Injuries, at one stage or another, to Jonny May, Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell have meant that the head coach has not been able to pick two from those three in any of his 15 matches in charge. He has broadened his search beyond that trio \u2013 Marland Yarde, Semesa Rokoduguni and latterly Elliot Daly have all been played on the wing and it is a quirk of Jones\u2019s team selection that he has not named the same wings for consecutive matches in England\u2019s last six games. But for the first time he can pick from May, Nowell, Daly and Watson against Italy on Sunday. Last week the indications were that Mike Brown may hang on to the No15 jersey and Daly would switch from wing to outside-centre, leaving the two wide spots up for grabs. So far in the Six Nations, May started against France but lost the place to Nowell for the Wales game and the two have not started together under Jones. Indeed the last time they did was in 2014, against Italy. On Sunday, however, Nowell is likely to play the role of workhorse, leaving May competing with Watson to be the speed option. \u201cI guess me and Ant would be under the racehorse category, so I guess we are competing for spots with one another there,\u201d May said. \u201cWe\u2019re both quick guys and it\u2019ll be for Eddie to decide who he wants.\u201d So who is quicker? \u201cHonestly I don\u2019t actually know but we\u2019d be the quickest in the squad, I\u2019d say. Elliot\u2019s got gas as well, he\u2019s been on the left wing doing well and it just shows \u2013 he probably wasn\u2019t a winger but he\u2019s come in and done really well. We have got to be at our best at training and on game day if we want to play. It\u2019s that tight for spots.\u201d While Jones is always at pains to point out that no one\u2019s place in his side is safe, his willingness to chop and change his wings is magnified by the fact Brown has started all but one of the past 15 matches. Out wide, on the other hand, as well as Watson, Nowell, May and Daly, Jones has on four occasions called on Yarde to add extra power and he gave Rokoduguni his second cap against Fiji. Sooner rather than later, however, the whole back three is likely to become more fluid with Watson and Daly both earmarked as long-term successors to Brown at full-back. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, you honestly don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to play,\u201d said May. \u201cBut we want to be the best team in the world and it\u2019s only going to make us better players, competing with one another to get in that team. Eddie can choose who he wants to win certain games. \u201cEddie just said he wanted a different type of player for the Wales game in Jack, and he was awesome against Wales, he was strong, carried hard. We\u2019ve all got to be our best and work incredibly hard and hopefully we\u2019ll get a chance.\u201d Such competition for places means there is little room for error. Daly\u2019s two starts on the wing, against France and Wales, demonstrate that his red card against Argentina in the autumn has not been held against him but May believes his early yellow against Les Bleus did him no favours. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t a good thing, is it? We always get judged on what we do out on the pitch and that\u2019s a negative impact on the game, whether it\u2019s a penalty or a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t use that as an excuse, you can\u2019t say it was just a bit of bad luck. It may be a bit annoying that those things happen but at this level it can\u2019t happen so I can\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d May\u2019s eccentricities and elastic running style make him a popular figure on and off the field and as revealed earlier this month, he and Ben Te\u2019o have hit it off over discussions about North Korea. But May was suitably diplomatic over Te\u2019o\u2019s claims the pair were set to pack their bags for Pyongyang. \u201cWe were only joking around, I didn\u2019t actually want to go to North Korea. But it\u2019s an interesting place and we watched a few documentaries on it. It\u2019s pretty scary what goes on there. It\u2019s an eye-opener,\u201d May said. \u201cYou start watching a couple of things and you get into it and you think, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019ll watch a bit more\u2019 and I watched a few documentaries on YouTube about it and it is fascinating \u2013 it\u2019s scary how different their lives are over there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
