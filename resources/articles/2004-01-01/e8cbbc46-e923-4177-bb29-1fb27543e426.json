Not so at Bolton, where Sam Allardyce was so overcome by a scuffling victory that moved his side nine points clear of the bottom three that he was heard to speak in a strange tongue. Big Sam's press conference was routine fare, all about \"digging out a win\", but his delighted outpouring on BBC GMR provided entertainment for thousands of supporters as they queued to get out of the biggest car-park jam in football-land. Big Sam revealed: \"We had a pedantic tempo in the first half. We tittered on the edge of nervous stability.\" But, he recollected, they had defended well, and Bolton are not exactly known for that. Or, as he preferred to put it: \"That's better than this irate attacking football that we keep doing and getting bugger all from it.\" At Manchester City, Blackburn and, lo and behold, even at Everton, the shivers at the prospect of relegation cannot be suppressed. Yet, courtesy of this victory, Bolton lie 10th. They are closer to a Champions League spot than relegation, but that does not matter. There is no doubt which way they are looking. Allardyce has earned his satisfaction at days like these. But it has to be said that an \"irate\" Bolton are much more appealing. They mangled their passes like Big Sam mangled his words, inhibited by a cloying, uneven surface. The first half was a complete bore; the second, when they showed more appetite, just about presentable. Portsmouth, still seeking their first Premiership away win after 12 attempts, deserved a draw. They might have got one too, had not Shaka Hislop made such a feeble attempt to save Kevin Davies's winner. Youri Djorkaeff deftly fed Nicky Hunt on the right and his low cross was weakly turned past the goalkeeper by Davies from four yards. Davies led Bolton's line combatively and Djorkaeff, not for the first time, was the most alert player on view. But Jay-Jay Okocha seemed mentally departed for the African Nations Cup. He then surprised everyone by suggesting that he might even stay on for Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final first-leg against Aston Villa, even though he must captain Nigeria in their opening match against Morocco in Monastir only six days later. It sounds unlikely. It will take that long to find BBC3. Portsmouth have already played most of the top sides away from home, and on this evidence a first win on the road will not be long coming. They have scored only three away goals, and were unlucky not to swell that number on the hour. Ivan Campo's flimsy challenge set up a chance for Yakubu Ayegbeni, but his shot deflected off Emerson Thome and trundled against a post. Portsmouth's most stupid moment came in stoppage time when Dejan Stefanovic, angered by a perfectly acceptable challenge by Davies, swore at the referee and was sent off. Portsmouth's manager, Harry Redknapp, was scarlet at his stupidity. \"Players who get sent off for dissent don't deserve to get paid,\" he said. Stefanovic doubtless learned a few more English oaths by the time Redknapp had underlined the point. \u00b7 Mario Jardel has left Bolton to joined Ancona , winless and bottom of Serie A, on loan. The 30-year-old Brazilian has yet to score a Premiership goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
