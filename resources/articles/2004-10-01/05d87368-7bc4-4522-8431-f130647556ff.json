A dispute has emerged over the BOA's insistence that official Adidas-sponsored Team GB kit must be worn during the parade and subsequent presentation at Trafalgar Square. Nike, which sponsors Lewis-Francis, and Reebok, whose kit is endorsed by Holmes and Campbell, point to the fact that the contractual obligation for their athletes to sport federation uniform expired seven days after the Olympic Games' closing ceremony. \"We were made aware of the parameters and we like to feel we've obliged [in the agreement],\" said a Nike spokesperson yesterday. \"But now we are continuing our contracts and if it is in a sporting context, our athletes must wear Nike.\" Reebok adopted a similar position, saying in a statement last night: \"We respect our athletes wearing competitor kit in competition and are therefore disappointed that a competitor has chosen to place our athletes in a potentially compromising position.\" The BOA claims that it has come under no pressure from Adidas, but is determined to fulfil what it considers to be its obligation to the sportswear manufacturer, whose sponsorship funds assisted Team GB in its 30-medal haul in Athens. The deal with Adidas stipulates it is the only kit company that may be associated with British Olympic success and, since the athletes will wear their medals, its clause would be triggered. The federation also considers it important that athletes wear their Team GB tracksuits at an event being staged while London bids to host the 2012 games. Any athlete not prepared to wear the official kit will be barred from attending. None the less, it is clear that neither Nike nor Reebok are ready to back down with just six days to go before the parade, which culminates in a visit to Buckingham Palace for the medallists. They have offered a compromise position, allowing their athletes to wear the Ben Sherman suits that are set to be worn at the Palace in the evening. However, the BOA counters that these suits are not available to the Paralympians. \"If manufacturers are trying to apply pressure on these athletes, they are making a very big mistake in the eyes of the British public,\" said the BOA's Philip Pope. \"We have one option as a team. We will be appearing as united, all in the apparel available to both teams. Other manufacturers do not have the right to connect Olympic success to their brand.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
