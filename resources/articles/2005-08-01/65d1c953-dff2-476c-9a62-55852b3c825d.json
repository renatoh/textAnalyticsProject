In 2004, Alcott got a call from the actor (and cousin of New Zealand cricketing brothers) Russell Crowe, before the filming of the Ron Howard-directed movie Cinderella Man. Crowe had dislocated his shoulder and flew Alcott out to the film set in Toronto to work on him for the next five months. Alcott, a long-time employee of the Australian cricket team, had inevitably been recommended to Crowe by the Oscar-winner's buddy, Shane Warne.
