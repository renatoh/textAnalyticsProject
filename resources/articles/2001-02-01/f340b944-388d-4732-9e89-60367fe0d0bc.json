It may be clutching at straws but it is a notion the Premiership must cling to. It is a trait of this declining title race that many of United's lessers have seemed almost frightened to offend when confronted with Sir Alex Ferguson's embarrassment of riches. It is a fine line. While going gung-ho against the champions is usually the prelude to going belly-up, the popular stifling tactic of clogging defence and hoping for the best has proved a futile exercise. United, after all, have failed to score in only two of their last 51 home games. Liverpool got the balance right to snaffle a 1-0 win at Old Trafford before Christmas and West Ham did so exquisitely in the FA Cup eight days ago. Everton, too, refused to hoist the white flag on Saturday. Of course, there is always the suspicion that when the mood takes them, United's bloated resources are such they can dismiss any of their challengers without so much as a cursory look back. They have also been operating on what is known in America as the iceberg theory, that the bulk of their most devastating power remains hidden beneath the surface. Producing only a fraction of their awesome force yet emerging as victors is not a bad habit either but it has been noticeable of late that visitors to Old Trafford have been playing with a deal more adventure and self-belief. Will it last? Everton accepted the challenge with surprising relish and the impertinence of it all unsettled United and unnerved their fans. \"We're one of the smaller teams at the moment and it must be difficult for the likes of David Beckham and Ryan Giggs to get up for it,\" said Richard Gough. \"I know myself from being at Rangers that, when you are dominating everything, it is hard to motivate yourself against the smaller clubs.\" As Ferguson views complacency as something of a dirty word, he would doubtless recoil at the suggestion that some of his players had allowed it to creep in unnoticed. Yet it has been a long time since his team failed to manoeuvre a single shot on target in a match anywhere. \"Come to Old Trafford for excitement, eh?\" he asked, dryly. The absence of Roy Keane deprived United of their driving influence and once Paul Scholes had suffered a recurrence of a rib injury the midfield skirmish was won by Thomas Gravesen and Scot Gemmill. Gough is 39 going on 21 and Michael Ball was outstanding alongside him as the left-sided centre-back in a five-man defence. Walter Smith's limited but willing side deserved better than the two deflections that cost them. Andy Cole's diagonal shot was drifting wide until it ricocheted off Steve Watson's heel to loop over Paul Gerrard whereas, when Joe-Max Moore's shot struck Jaap Stam, the deflection wrong-footed Fabien Barthez but the ball spun over the crossbar. All of which means United need 22 points to make certain of their seventh title in nine years, one that has come so easily that the rest of the Premiership should be squirming with embarrassment. For the time being clutching at straws is about the only thing left. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
