Unexpectedly they uncovered claims of sexual assault against the BBC\u2019s own staff. The corporation sent an anonymous survey to 247 employees who work for assembly members in April. Thirty people responded, with three saying they had been sexually assaulted in their workplace. One said they had been \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d by a BBC employee, while another said they had been sexually assaulted by a BBC worker. A third person reported sexual assault by an assembly member. The survey submissions were all anonymous, meaning it is difficult to check the claims. The survey covered staff who work in the assembly\u2019s Cardiff Bay headquarters and also in constituency offices. The BBC will broadcast the allegations on Wednesday night in an edition of the BBC Wales Live programme. It will include the testimony of a further six employees of assembly members who said they had experienced workplace bullying or sexual harassment. One of these individuals used the survey to complain they had been \u201caccosted aggressively by a BBC journalist\u201d while doing their job. Rhodri Talfan Davies, the director of BBC Wales, emailed staff before the broadcast and urged them to come forward with any concerns. He said: \u201cWe obviously take these matters very seriously and \u2013 although anonymous allegations of this nature are extremely difficult to verify \u2013 we will of course look carefully at the information that has been broadcast. \u201cIn the meantime, if anyone has any concerns they would like to raise confidentially, we wanted to remind you about the support that is in place. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we have a positive culture here \u2013 one where you\u2019re confident you\u2019ll be heard, listened to and supported in dealing with any serious issues.\u201d Not all the accusations by assembly members\u2019 staff were about the BBC. There was also an anonymous complaint about being \u201cshouted or sworn\u201d at by an assembly member and another complained about having to endure an \u201cawful toxic environment\u201d. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cIf anyone has any information they think could assist us in these matters, they can access our details on the BBC Whistleblowing website \u2013 which provides options to contact the BBC directly or via an independent organisation, Expolink. \u201cWe are also reminding staff of the BBC\u2019s policies should they wish to raise any concerns confidentially.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
