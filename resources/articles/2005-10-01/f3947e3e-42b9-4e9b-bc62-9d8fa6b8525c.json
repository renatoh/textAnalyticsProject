And if, as the boss's PA, you end up being the last guard against their appalling people skills, their inability to use email and their barely passing acquaintance with the business, you would not be blamed for wondering why you don't have his or her job. Unfortunately, getting yourself appointed top dog is not straightforward. Matt Jevon, a performance management adviser, has worked with everyone from top managers at blue-chip companies to the UK Olympic team. He reckons wanting your boss's job is healthy, but that many people have an incomplete idea of what their manager does. \"If you're serious about moving up, it's essential to research your boss's job thoroughly,\" he says. \"Look beyond the bits that relate to you - their job may be more complex than you realise.\" Abbie Gadd, a marketing manager at the educational publisher iPledge, started out as a PA and now manages four people. \"I don't think that I had a plan when I started my first job,\" she admits, \"but I did have a gut feeling that I wouldn't be satisfied as a PA.\" After gaining experience in a number of different PA roles, she decided to specialise in advertising and marketing. It didn't take long before she was promoted out of administration and into her first management role, as an account executive. Gadd says working for a small, hands-on company and her readiness to take opportunities for more experience made all the difference. \"When I was still a PA, if I was the only one in the office and a decision had to be made, I had to make it,\" she says. \"It was a bit hairy and sometimes I felt way out of my depth, but it had to be done - and I did secretly enjoy it.\" Gadd believes her PA skills stood her in good stead. \"My first ever client as an account exec was incredibly hard work,\" she explains. \"She had more experience than me, but by always making sure I maintained good relationships, I was eventually able to gain her respect.\" Olivia Lawson started as a PA to figure out exactly what kind of job she wanted. Joining the BBC's production panel (the internal PA pool), Lawson was posted to departments across the BBC before landing a permanent non-PA role as an internal communications executive. \"When I graduated, I decided that all the media schemes looked very competitive and inflexible,\" she says. \"I didn't know which part of the industry I wanted to work in, so going in as a PA meant that I got to work everywhere from Woman's Hour to Football Focus.\" Lawson thinks the contacts she made during her time as a PA were key to climbing the ladder. \"I made loads of contacts because I worked all over the place, and I still maintain them now, even if it's just through an email to say hello every six months,\" she says. \"And because it's such a competitive industry, good contacts mean I get to hear about all the jobs that are only advertised internally.\" Both Lawson and Gadd won promotion by being positive about their skills, but can skulduggery and plotting your boss's dismissal be equally effective? Not according to career coach Joanne Mallon, who has advised everyone from BBC staff to former MPs. \"If your manager is incompetent, you're not going to be the only person in the organisation who will have noticed it,\" she points out. \"In that situation, it's vital to work out how you can fill their gaps - if you work to your own strengths and boost your own profile, you are bound to rise.\" Jevon agrees. \"There are situations where it can work, but it is a very high risk strategy,\" he confirms. \"Never forget that your manager can fire you and if you undermine them, they'll sideline you.\" If your manager is drawing more attention to his penchant for client lunches than to the skills of his team, you may have to be creative to raise your profile. Mallon believes that selling yourself as if you were Del Boy trying to get rid of some questionably procured Cava won't do you any favours. \"People often think profile-raising is all about a 'hard sell' every time you run into anyone with any power,\" she says. \"People promote and recruit those they like and know, so a much more effective long-term approach is to build relationships with them and those around you.\" She also thinks that the small things can make a difference. \"Dressing for the job you want, and dressing smartly, can be effective, provided it's still your own style, and not a costume that you put on for work,\" she says. In fact, having PA experience can be an advantage as you inch yourself up the greasy pole, as Gadd points out. \"Because I started my career as a PA it's much easier to manage my team,\" she says. \"They know I'm not asking them to do anything that I haven't done myself.\" Making the leap from PA to boss may be challenging but it's not impossible. So the next time your manager submits the wrong end-of-year figures, or sets the whole team on hourly productivity goals, just remember that his days might be numbered. After all, even David Brent was sacked in the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
