That book is now a global bestseller, and Kay a celebrated author whose gory and shocking anecdotes have drawn attention to the struggling NHS and its overstretched staff. His new book is going to hurt with tinsel on top. Obstetrics and gynaecology on Christmas Day (and Kay worked six of them) is the same bloody mess, but more so. Hospitals are understaffed and medics exhausted but babies don\u2019t stop coming, alcohol doesn\u2019t help anything, A&amp;E is full of abandoned grannies and \u201celderly patients who\u2019ve gone full Jenga on the ice, shattering their hips like bags of biscuits\u201d, and patients just won\u2019t stop inserting objects into intimate places from which world-weary medics have to remove them. There is plenty here for fans of the \u201cdisgusting\u201d: the woman who used peanut butter as a lubricant, only to discover that her nut allergy affected her; the man who \u201cdesiccated himself to the human equivalent of a Ryvita\u201d by going to a Christmas party as a turkey, wrapped in tinfoil; the woman subjected to Johnny Mathis during a forceps delivery who yelled at the radio: \u201cNo, Johnny. That is not what happens when a child is born.\u201d There\u2019s also the time when Kay loudly set off his novelty Christmas tie while breaking the worst news to a family. And when he carried out a late termination of a pregnancy to save a woman\u2019s life \u2013 a story he kept from his first book because he couldn\u2019t face thinking about it again. It is horribly upsetting, and Kay doesn\u2019t hold back. It\u2019s incidents like this \u2013 and the lack of care that the NHS shows staff who have to cope with them \u2013 that led to his leaving medicine. Kay is equally outspoken about the politics of the NHS: the \u201cevil\u201d health secretaries, the underinvestment, the stupid efficiency initiatives (from scrubs dispensers to voice-activated switchboards) and the damage done by spending one\u2019s entire career in an \u201cemotional brace position\u201d. But the worst part is how relationships outside work buckle under the pressure. A career in medicine is not just for life, it\u2019s for Christmas, and this year half a million NHS staff will be spending the day at work. They\u2019ll be working Christmas miracles; the least the rest of us can do is read this funny, sympathetic and eye-opening book, be overwhelmed with gratitude, and avoid off-label uses of condiments at least until the new year. \u2022 Twas the Night Before Christmas is published by Picador (\u00a39.99).
