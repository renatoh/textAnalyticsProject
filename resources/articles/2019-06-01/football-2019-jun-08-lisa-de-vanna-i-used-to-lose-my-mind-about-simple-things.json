Never afraid to speak her mind, the 34-year-old has had almost as many clubs as years spent as a professional footballer. Yet as she approaches the twilight of her playing career there\u2019s a sense a more self-contented De Vanna has finally come to terms with her emotions. Ahead of her first World Cup, De Vanna was described by her then coach Alistair Edwards as \u201chigh maintenance\u201d, \u201ca brat\u201d and possessing mood swings \u201clike the stock market crash of 1987\u201d. It was a tempestuous relationship, and Edwards was not alone in having difficulties with De Vanna. But coaches around the world continued to persist for one simple reason: the lightning-quick forward was prodigiously talented. An outsider who endured a challenging upbringing, De Vanna makes no apologies for her previous behaviour. \u201cI was never a sheep when I was younger,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve always been my own person. And if I didn\u2019t like something I was quite happy to say, \u2018nah, I\u2019m leaving\u2019. I didn\u2019t feel any peer pressure because I had such a big strong personality.\u201d Yet there\u2019s an increasingly reflective quality to De Vanna \u2013 as if finally she\u2019s more assured of herself, and her place in the world. \u201cI\u2019m not the best communicator, I don\u2019t know how to express my emotions. A lot of the time, I don\u2019t understand how you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m thinking. How can I see something as not good enough, and you don\u2019t?\u201d A notorious perfectionist, the biggest source of De Vanna\u2019s frustrations was a perceived lack of professionalism around her in an era when women\u2019s football in Australia was moving from amateurism to semi-professionalism. One of the first to crack the professional women\u2019s scene in the United States with Washington Freedom in 2009, De Vanna was caught between two worlds when returning to an Australian context that appeared light-years behind. \u201cI used to lose my mind about simple things,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, how do you not want to work hard, how do you not want to play with pride? Because I was in that environment when I had the best in the world, with Abby Wambach and Sonia Bompastor \u2013 these legends of the game \u2013 and they drilled it into my head, to be the best you have to train the best. \u201cIn the past [other Matildas] didn\u2019t care \u2013 but I cared. So then I\u2019m the one blowing up because I wanted the best for myself, I wanted the best for my team and I expected better from my teammates.\u201d Part of De Vanna\u2019s frustrations arose from the challenges she overcame to represent the national team, not least financial hardship. From buying her first pairs of shoes, second-hand for $3, to working at petrol stations around a busy schedule of private training to top up the teams\u2019 preparations ahead of her first World Cup, De Vanna has had it tough. \u201cI missed most of my teenage years, I gave up everything for football, but the good thing was I had good people around me. My friends who were going out partying turned around and said, \u2018nup, go home\u2019. They never got me involved in that environment because they knew from the way I talked about football that this was something I always wanted.\u201d And with the game around her professionalising rapidly, De Vanna now feels more in step with her surroundings. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had a conversation about \u2018developing a winning mentality\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had that winning mentality. I was like that 10 years ago but I got in trouble for it \u2013 and now I was turning away from that because my whole life I was told that it\u2019s not acceptable to blow up!\u201d Twice removed from the Matildas set up for behavioural issues, De Vanna has overcome every obstacle set in her path, and now stands on the cusp of becoming Australia\u2019s most-capped footballer, surpassing Matildas legend Cheryl Salisbury\u2019s mark of 151 appearances. Approaching her fourth World Cup, and with the chance to join an elite club of players to have scored at all four, De Vanna now finds her role changing \u2013 less an impassioned motivator of her fellow players and more of a mentor for the next generation. \u201cEllie [Carpenter] might get a little bit cheeky, but she\u2019s also young \u2013 she hasn\u2019t been in the game long enough to understand the maturity of it,\u201d De Vanna says. \u201cMary Fowler, she goes and plays NPL and scores six, seven goals, has this confidence, goes and plays young Matildas, kills it, but now she\u2019s in an environment that\u2019s a little tense \u2013 it\u2019s high pressure, and she\u2019s now realising, \u2018wow, I need to up my game\u2019. \u201cIn terms of mindset she\u2019s such a humble kid, who just purely wants to do great things \u2026 But it\u2019s been a good wake-up call for her as well. A couple of weeks ago we were doing sprints and I said \u2018I\u2019ll go with Mary\u2019 and I made sure I beat her on every single one just to bring her back down to earth a little bit.\u201d A strong adherent to what she calls \u201cold school\u201d ways, De Vanna also wants to imbue the next generation with traditional values: work hard, train hard, never let your passion for the game be distracted. \u201cEverything\u2019s so superficial now \u2013 it\u2019s all about social media, and I don\u2019t like that. I think you have to have a little old school in there. Everyone\u2019s looking for acceptance and approval from people they don\u2019t know, and I just feel like you have to be happy within yourself. If you start letting people who don\u2019t know you make opinions about yourself then you\u2019ll never be successful.\u201d Despite her stellar career, it\u2019s been a frustrating few years both on and off the pitch for De Vanna, who for the first time in her career failed to score a single goal during an injury-ravaged W-League season with Sydney FC. But the belief of new coach Ante Milicic in backing the veteran star has helped lift the mercurial striker. \u201cJust how I\u2019m feeling at the moment, I think my mindset is probably the best it\u2019s been in the last few years, and I know it\u2019s probably my last one so there\u2019s nothing to lose really, is there? \u201cI just want to walk off the field knowing I\u2019ve given it everything; and I\u2019m happy because the last 10-15 years of football have been stressful because I\u2019ve expected so much. But now I don\u2019t feel like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
