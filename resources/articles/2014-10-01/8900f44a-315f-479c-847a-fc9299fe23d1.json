That said, O\u2019Brien\u2019s ability to find the right horse for the right race is unequalled, and Jacobean, the runner-up to stable-mate Royal Navy Ship on his debut in a big field at The Curragh earlier this month, should improve significantly having taken time to realise what was required. He is clearly held in high regard and can show why this afternoon, but whether that will be enough to beat Elm Park (3.50) is another question. Andrew Balding\u2019s colt, a shrewd purchase by Qatar Racing before his victory in the Royal Lodge last time out, was much better than the warm favourite Nafaqa at Newmarket and can give Andrea Atzeni his first Group One in the colours that he will be wearing as Qatar Racing\u2019s No1 jockey next season. Newbury 1.50 There have been far better renewals of the Horris Hill than this one, and Not So Sleepy, the least-exposed runner, may well be good enough to beat his more experienced opponents. Stamina will certainly not be an issue and he won his maiden with something to spare. Aintree 2.00 Broughton was not up to Grade One juvenile company last year but looked good at Musselburgh in February and has a fair mark at a track that should suit. Doncaster 2.10 Salt Island looked a colt of some potential on his successful debut at Windsor two months ago and his yard has a nice string of two-year-olds in the stable this campaign. Newbury 2.20 Sky Hunter had been gelded prior to his win in a Listed event at Ayr last month and it may prove to be the making of him after joining Saeed bin Suroor from Andr\u00e9 Fabre at the end of last season. Doncaster 2.40 David O\u2019Meara has enjoyed a breakthrough season and his string remains in form, making Open Eagle the obvious choice here. The five-year-old stays the trip, acts on the ground and even after his latest win at York, remains well handicapped on his best form. Aintree 3.00 Rajdhani Express was below form over this track and trip back in April but is a fresh horse today and has an obvious chance on his third place in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham. Doncaster 3.15 Dungannon bounced back to form at Ascot last time, and his last four career victories have been recorded in either September or October. A 4lb rise in the weights is not unbridgeable and he makes as much appeal as any in an extremely trappy handicap. Newbury 3.30 Burano will be a name on the gravestone of plenty of punting careers after a season of regular disappointments. He will surely pop up sooner or later, but Ennistown is a more solid proposition having got off the mark for the season last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
