The hardening line in EU capitals comes as Nigel Farage warns European leaders that Marine Le Pen, leader of the Front National, could deliver a political sensation bigger than Brexit and win France\u2019s presidential election next spring \u2013 a result that would mean it was \u201cgame over\u201d for 60 years of EU integration. According to senior officials at the highest levels of European governments, allowing Britain favourable terms of exit could represent an existential danger to the EU, since it would encourage similar demands from other countries with significant Eurosceptic movements. One top EU diplomat told the Observer: \u201cIf you British are not prepared to compromise on free movement, the only way to deal with Brexit is hard Brexit. Otherwise we would be seen to be giving in to a country that is leaving. That would be fatal.\u201d The latest intervention by Farage will only serve to fuel fears in Europe that anti-EU movements have acquired a dangerous momentum in countries such as France and the Netherlands, following the precedent set by the Brexit vote. Ukip\u2019s interim leader, who predicted both the vote for Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s US victory, told the Observer that while Le Pen was still more likely to be runner-up to an establishment candidate next May, she now had to be taken seriously as a potential head of state. \u201cShe will clearly win through to the second round. And after what has happened elsewhere, only a fool would say she would have no chance of winning overall. France is a deeply, deeply unhappy country. If she were to win, it would be game over for the EU.\u201d Le Pen has made clear she wants to take France out of the euro and the EU. The prospective hardline approach has been agreed by the 27 member states as a bloc. Acting in concert, the remaining EU states will refuse to grant the UK access to the single market unless London agrees to sign up to its rules, including free movement of people, capital, services and labour. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag, told the Observer that he wanted to help the UK but, if there were no willingness to accept EU rules, there was no hope. \u201cI am really ready to come to a result but if [the British position is] no, no, no, then even I would have to say that there is no common ground.\u201d The vice-president of the centre-right European People\u2019s party, German MEP David McAllister, added: \u201cYou can\u2019t have 100% control over internal migration, say no to European Court of Justice rulings, and that you won\u2019t pay anything [into the budget]. This just won\u2019t work. \u201cThe British are testing us \u2013 we all know that. They are testing how united Europe is. So what is important is that Europe stays together. No bilateral negotiations with the British. No cherry-picking. We are doing this as a bloc.\u201d Trump\u2019s sensational victory led some members of the French establishment, and politicians in Berlin and Brussels, to worry that Le Pen could benefit from a similar wave of popular discontent and pose a real threat. Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said reason no longer prevailed in France and that Le Pen \u201ccan win\u201d. Farage, who has been heavily critical of the Front National as a party, but admires Le Pen personally, said he had not had time to think about whether he would support her campaign for the Elys\u00e9e. \u201cIt has been too busy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I would say is that I have not had anything good to say about the National Front but equally not anything bad to say about Marine Le Pen. I think the important thing for her is to run as much as possible as an individual, as her own person.\u201d French MEP Constance Le Grip said she did not believe Le Pen could win, but admitted there was a danger of bolstering support for her if the UK were given an exit deal that was too favourable. \u201cIf you start to reshape the whole project to be some sort of Europe \u00e0 la carte it is the beginning of the end, apart from the fact that Le Pen will then claim victory, Wilders in the Netherlands, and so on. More opt-outs for the UK would be absolutely incoherent and absurd. \u201d On 29 October, less than two weeks before Trump seized the White House, Farage rejected prevailing opinion and forecast his victory against Hillary Clinton. \u201cI am going to predicthere and now that Trump is going to win.\u201d On 1 June \u2013 22 days before the Brexit vote \u2013 he said: \u201cI believe we will win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
