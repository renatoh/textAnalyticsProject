The Tottenham striker, who injured an ankle in a pre-season friendly against Rangers, is one goal behind Niall Quinn's mark of 21. He can pull level and overtake against Cyprus in Dublin on September 4 and Switzerland in Basle four days later. Keane has yet to play in the Premiership this season. He travelled with Tottenham to the Midlands for tonight's match at West Bromwich but will undergo a fitness test before a decision is made on his availability. Brian Kerr, the Ireland manager, said: \"I was aware that Robbie was making good progress after talking to [the Spurs coach] Chris Hughton and also talking to Robbie, so hopefully he gets some games in the next week and will be ready for us.\" Kerr has also gambled on the fitness of the Birmingham City striker Clinton Morrison who hurt a knee in last week's 1-1 friendly draw with Bulgaria. Morrison missed his club's 1-0 Premiership defeat by Chelsea but his manager, Steve Bruce, said yesterday that the injury was not a serious problem. Kerr also selected the Charlton midfielder Matt Holland, who has an ankle injury, saying: \"He is on the road to recovery and hopes to start running again in the next couple of days.\" Southampton's Rory Delap was recalled to the squad after recovering from a knee injury of his own which forced him to miss matches against Romania, Nigeria, Jamaica and Holland at the end of last season. Delap played the second half of Saints' season-opening 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa and then the full 90 minutes in Saturday's 3-2 win over Blackburn. Kerr said: \"Rory is fit and well and gives us added strength and experience. He's very adaptable which will help us also because he can slot into a number of positions. \"He has been unlucky with injuries but has had a good pre-season and has started the season well.\" Rep of Ireland (v Cyprus and Switzerland) Given (Newcastle), Colgan (Barnsley), Kenny (Sheff Utd); Finnan (Liverpool), Cunningham (Birmingham), O'Brien (Newcastle), Maybury (Hearts), O'Shea (Man Utd), Carr (Newcastle), Doherty (Norwich), Breen (Sunderland); Miller (Man Utd), Quinn (Sheff Utd), Roy Keane (Man Utd), Holland (Charlton), Kavanagh (Cardiff), Reid (Nottm Forest), Kilbane (Everton), Duff (Chelsea), Lee (Cardiff); Morrison (Birmingham), Connolly (Leicester), Keane (Tottenham), Delap (Southampton)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
