That has prompted concern that under-18s are struggling to get care at the same time that levels of anxiety and depression in that age group have risen sharply. The findings have emerged from a survey by the charity YoungMinds of 1,850 parents and carers around the UK, 750 of whom have a child who had received support and treatment for mental health issues in the previous three months. Out of those 750 parents, 25% said their child was no longer able to access help from the NHS, private providers, helplines, school counsellors or charities even though they still needed it. Many NHS mental health services are suspended or restricted, or have changed to involve mainly remote consultations by telephone or video. \u201cThe pandemic has turned the lives of millions of children and young people upside down. Many young people are finding it hard to cope with isolation, a loss of routine, anxiety about the future, a disruption to their education, and in some cases difficult or traumatic experiences at home,\u201d said Emma Thomas, chief executive of YoungMinds. \u201cDespite huge efforts from mental health professionals, young people with existing mental health needs often can\u2019t get the same level of support as they had before the crisis. \u201cAs our survey shows, many parents and carers are deeply worried about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the young people in their care, and don\u2019t know where to turn for advice and support\u201d, she added. The results come a week after Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health, disclosed that the number of under-18s being referred to NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) had fallen by 30% to 40% since the pandemic began. Some of that reduction will be because schools, which make many such referrals, are closed. But Murdoch told MPs on the Commons health select committee that more parents of troubled children may be \u201chunkering down at home\u201d and not wanting to seek care for their child through the usual referral routes, with some believing that help was not available. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said parents and troubled children should continue to seek help from the NHS in the usual way. \u201cWe are absolutely committed to supporting the mental wellbeing of families and children, especially during these extraordinary times. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re ensuring our mental health services are adapting to best support families and children, and recently provided \u00a35m to leading mental health charities to help them expand and reach those most in need. \u201cFamilies and children should still feel able to contact their GP or CAMHS for support.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
