Lizzie Kelly, Bryony Frost and Rachael Blackmore all rode winners at Cheltenham in March but it is now 32 years since Gay Kelleway\u2019s victory on Sprowston Boy in the Queen Alexandra Stakes. What might have been a groundbreaking success has proved to be anything but. It is, on the face of it, a little embarrassing for Flat racing\u2019s showpiece event. Even Hayley Turner, twice a Group One winner and the most successful British female rider with more than 800 winners to her name, has missed out at Royal Ascot, although she did finish a head behind the winner on Margot Did in the Albany Stakes in 2010. Hollie Doyle was on the runner-up in last year\u2019s Sandringham Handicap, while Josephine Gordon, the champion apprentice in 2016, was a half-length second on Steady Pace in the Wokingham two seasons ago. But these are very much the exceptions. In all, 115 runners at Royal Ascot since 1989 have been ridden by women and 10 have made the frame, at an average starting price of 42-1. Even that number hides the actual chance of most runners ridden by women at the meeting. Margot Did was strong in the betting at 7-1, while Dream Castle, in the 2017 Jersey Stakes, was a 9-2 shot for Gordon who also rode a 6-1 favourite in the Sandringham Handicap the same afternoon. The majority of the remainder, though, were in effect no-hopers. Female riders are not riding winners at the meeting because, for the most part, they do not get realistic opportunities to do so. In all the tradition and hidebound formality that sets Royal Ascot apart, this could be seen as one more example of lingering sexism at the meeting where, until a few years ago, women in the Royal enclosure were assumed to be mere appendages of their husbands when it came to the names on their badges. But before jumping to any conclusions, consider this: the great majority of the country\u2019s male jockeys never get a decent chance to ride a Royal Ascot winner either. The same goes for apprentice jockeys, even the best of the up-and-comers whose claims do not guarantee rides in the handicaps as would be the case elsewhere. Around a third of the horses running in British handicaps in June over the past 15 years have been ridden by a rider with a claim. At Royal Ascot in the same period, 7% of handicap rides \u2013 217 in all \u2013 went to a claiming jockey and five were winners. These included the future Derby-winner William Buick, who was, with hindsight, pretty good value for a 5lb claim on Dark Missile in the 2007 Wokingham. Essentially, it is only the elite riders \u2013 a dozen at most \u2013 who get full books of rides at Royal Ascot, where the horses change from race to race but the jockeys do not. As things stand, no major stable has a female rider as its No 1 and until that changes the next woman to ride a winner at the Royal meeting seems likely to be an apprentice for whom all the cards fall right in one of the handicaps. That could take 10 years \u2013 or, possibly, a few days. Nicola Currie is the leading female apprentice at present and she looks to have one of the best chances for a female rider at the meeting for several years aboard Jamie Osborne\u2019s Raising Sand in Wednesday\u2019s Royal Hunt Cup. This is one of the most competitive events of the week and the draw could also play a role, but Raising Sand has so much going for him that his current odds of 12-1 look much too big. He is an Ascot specialist \u2013 he scarcely runs anywhere else \u2013 and he was a convincing two-length winner over seven furlongs in a \u00a3100,000 contest last October. Raising Sand also ran an eye-catching trial for Wednesday\u2019s race on his seasonal debut, finishing strongly into fourth in the Victoria Cup. Currie knows him well, having ridden him on his past four starts, and has a live chance to double the number of female winning riders at the meeting. It is another sign of the depth of competition at Royal Ascot that even a jockey as popular and prolific as the former champion Jim Crowley has just five winners at the meeting, one of which was the 33-1 chance Bacchus in last year\u2019s Wokingham. He should get the week off to a good start, however, via Mustashry in the Queen Anne Stakes and has real hopes of an opening-day double if Battaash runs up to his best form in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes. King Of Comedy has a very similar profile to Without Parole, John Gosden\u2019s winner of the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes 12 months ago, and is worth backing at around 6-1 against Phoenix Of Spain and Gosden\u2019s Too Darn Hot in the feature race on day one. Sea Of Class will hopefully be ready to run close to her best in Wednesday\u2019s feature, the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes, while Cross Counter, the Melbourne Cup winner, could prove to be a serious and progressive opponent for Stradivarius in Thursday\u2019s Gold Cup. Ghaiyyath may be able to get back in Saturday\u2019s Hardwicke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
