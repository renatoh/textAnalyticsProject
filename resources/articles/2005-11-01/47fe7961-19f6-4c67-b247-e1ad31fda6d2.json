He also explained his decision to pick Eidur Gudjohnsen over Didier Drogba tonight: \"Eidur is a good striker, we think in this kind of situation we need somebody who holds the ball better.\" But we can expect to see Damien Duff in the second half, apparently. And the launch of ITV4 Yes, ITV's latest vehicle launches with this very game, and what have we learned already? That the severe delays between studio and touchline make exchanges between Robbie Earle and Jim Rosenthal just that bit more painful, that's what. Something to think about Berlin. This weekend. Recommendations? 1 min Betis kick off and immediately punt the ball into touch - let's hope that's not a sign of things to come, eh? And in case the 4-0 drubbing at Stamford Bridge didn't quite see the point home, ITV4 are keen to stress that Betis are \"fragile\". \"Berlin: it's all about 8mm Bar,\" reckons Mat Whittington (any relation?). \"Tremendous night out.\" Any more for any more? 3 mins Gudjohnsen looks to sneak onto the end of a long ball from Carvalho, but he's offside by a peroxide fringe. Betis work the ball forward nicely to get in behind Chelsea, but Melli is prevented from crossing by a timely Paulo Ferreira lunge. 5 mins Frank Lampard whistles across the turf in what appears to have been an attempt to pierce Joaquin's foot with every one of his studs and is duly penalised, shaking his head and muttering 'You're 'avin' a laarf' all the while. 7 mins A loose ball from Robben gives Arzu the chance to play Edu in, but Cech is quickly out to keep things ship shape for the away side. Gudjohnsen is flagged offside again, but not by much. 9 mins Betis don't exactly look cowed (not exactly surprising, since they need the win), but their wont to get forward is leaving gaps for Chelsea to make the most of. They won't be able to, mind, if Cech makes another clearance like that. Not quite the slice of the weekend, but a weak hoof that finds a Betis shirt... who can't do the same. 12 mins Arjen Robben's a curious creature: he manages to work his way into dangerous situations looking all the while as pedestrian as your gran crossing a cul-de-sac. No end product so far for Chelsea though, as a Joaquin free-kick at the other end scythes its way into the penalty area only to be booted away by Michael Essien. 14 mins Arzu swings in a cross from the right but the reliable head of John Terry seeks and destroys. Meanwhile Lampard embarks on a dinking run towards the byline, leaving it to trickle out for a corner, before the referee points for a goal-kick. Ah. \"I assume you're asking if I'm related to Dick Whittington (or his cat),\" scoffs Mat Whittington, \"and I've heard that joke about as many times as you've heard tea-swilling British having bad-teeth jokes.\" I'm hurt. My tooth is lovely. 17 mins Betis look enterprising in spells but they lack, so far, that moment of brilliance to startle the Chelsea defence into buggering things up. Joaquin's whipped corner looked like making things interesting for about a micro-second before Petr Cech raced onto it. 19 mins Nano goes off injured after side-footing a ball and twisting his knee, so it's an early appearance for Castellini. 22 mins Oh dear. Things go from bad to worse for Betis, with Oliveira tumbling awkwardly out of a challenge with Carvalho. He appears to be in no small amount of pain, and the buggy is on to take him to the hospital. \"Try the Riva Bar,\" says Richard Koss. \"A tunnel-shaped spot built into the arch below one of the U-Bahn lines. It's named after an obscure Italian footballer, and the crowd is straight out of a Fellini film. They make wonderful martinis.\" Sounds spiffing to me. 24 mins Joe Cole finds himself in the book for his noisy reaction to not winning a corner after playing himself into one of those dead-ends of old. Dani is on for Oliveira, meanwhile - but now Edu is grimacing and clutching his hip. Cripes. 27 mins Chelsea work the ball down the right but Essien's cross loops up and away from Cole and Gudjohnsen. Betis fail to deal with it though and Chelsea earn a corner... which Betis bundle clear despite Essien's best efforts. I'd rather like a goal about now. Wouldn't you? GOAL! Betis 1-0 Chelsea Capi rifles in a low cross which Dani manages to control and poke past Cech under the feeble attentions of Gallas. Well well. 30 mins Cole steers a wonderfully flighted cross into the box, but Essien's bonce merely bounces it up in the air and over the bar. At the other end Joaquin fires a shot off from the edge of the box, but a pair of Chelsea knees get in its way. 32 mins They're chanting and twirling flags in the stadium, and Betis' tails are well and truly up. Chelsea won't want to play on under the glare of that impertinent scoreboard for long though. 34 mins A couple of months ago I'd have packed myself off to the funny farm for uttering the words \"Chelsea just don't look as penetrative without Drogba\". But, well, it's sort of true so far tonight. 35 mins Melli's swinging cross causes all sorts of mayhem, as Dani and Cech clash in the chase for the ball, in turn sending Cech's foot in the direction of Terry's face. Liverpool are 1-0 up I hear, which puts them top of the group. 38 mins Betis are the side going forward with more purpose at the moment, Chelsea's distribution letting them down at key points. Cole finds himself on the ball in the corner but scuffs his cross and Betis push out again. Ooh! Cole avoids the offside flag and scurries into the penalty area, but his low shot is snaffled up by the hand of Contreras. \"Try Le Bar Voyeur,\" says David in Toronto. \"Ambiance and food aren't much, but if you like your strippers pouty and clad in fuzzy grey overcoats, this is the spot for you.\" Hmm. 40 mins The last time these two sides met, a poor Lampard free-kick somehow presented Carvalho with a goal. He gets one in the same position here, and again it's poor, but this time it gets only as far as the wall. Arzu is down injured, meanwhile. 41 mins Chelsea earn another free-kick, on the right this time, but Robben can't clear the first man either. Chelsea keep possession though and after a quick one-two with Essien, Robben fires a fearsome shot for the far corner. Contreras is equal to it though. 43 mins Ye gads. Gudjohnsen is played in by Terry with a frantic defender two paces behind him and the keeper getting ready to pick the ball out of the net... and scoops it into orbit. I'd have staked my house on him scoring that. Thankfully I don't own my house. 45 mins Dani has a speculative go, the ball zipping through Gallas's legs and causing a moment's concern for Cech. He's quickly onto the parry though, no sweat. 47 mins Christ! Edu whizzes a shot in from distance and Cech can only punch to the edge of the area, but Dani scoops his follow-up shot wide. Just. That's the end of the half - will Betis be made to rue that miss? \"If it's still there (it's been a few years for me) try the Funzel - it's the big brother of another of a similar name in Boeblingen,\" explains John Thompson. \"Old bar, old wooden decor, great beer (obviously in Germany) and a great schwein hackse (sic) - roasted pig's leg, with sauerkraut and potato salad. Not the place for health food, but you'll get a lot of political talk with your beer.\" Half-time If you're looking for something to pass the time, you could do worse than peruse this fine piece of journalism from my erstwhile colleague Rob Smyth. I don't think Mr Smyth can ever hope for a Christmas card from Fergie now, mind. \"Riva? Obscure? Come off it,\" mutters Thomas, in Hamburg. \"If you're in Berlin, try CSA (named after the not-at-all-obscure Czech airline) on the Karl-Marx Allee.\" All right, I will. \"Just don't try taking pictures of your friends outside. The be-muletted bartender will get upset.\" Doesn't want evidence of the 'do, that it? 45 mins Drogba and Wright-Phillips are on for Cole and Gudjohnsen as the trailing Blues get the second-half underway. Oof! Almost immediately they make a difference, Wright-Phillips's cross just - just - in front of Drogba's out-stretched toe. \"Your fans must assume that you're just in town to party - in case that's not true I'd recommend exploring the architecture of former East Berlin before it's bulldozed into oblivion,\" says Brett Henrikson. Sounds like something to ease a hangover, for sure. 48 mins OK, maybe I'm wrong here, but Drogba must weigh a fair few pounds I'm saying. So a weakly waved Betis elbow is hardly enough to knock him down right? Wrong. Lampard's free-kick sails far over the bar though. 51 mins Varela nudges in front of Robben to make the loose ball, and the Dutchman then brings him down. The decision goes Varela's way, but he gets a yellow card because Robben is now bleeding. Quite a lot. 55 mins Another thing we've learned about ITV4: it cuts out quite a bit. I've been looking at the back of Drogba's head for a few minutes, so what's been going on I can only imagine. Hmm. A streaker, I think. With a cut-out of Mourinho's face protecting his modesty. And Elvis has been discovered alive and well in the crowd. 57 mins I'm back, though I'm not so sure about Elvis. We haven't missed anything of vital importance though. 59 mins Betis found themselves in a great position, Joaquin steaming forward and finding Capi with players to spare around him. Capi smells glory, however, and takes on Ferreira and Carvalho. He ends up taking in a lungful of turf. 63 mins More scarf-twirling as Betis enjoy some possession, and Terry and Lampard almost contrive to leave the ball for Joaquin on the edge of the area. He runs past it too, luckily for them. 65 mins Damien Duff appears in place of Robben, as Makelele and Dani exchange words. Probably talking about bars in Berlin. 68 mins Melli and Carvalho land in a heap, and Melli gets a booking out of it. Bit harsh. But given that Betis are going to ground quicker than ripe apples, it's probably not too unfair. 70 mins Ooh, scandal! Drogba fouls one defender after another, ignoring the referee's whistle, then goes head to head with Contreras. Yellow card, utterly pointless. They're not exactly gracious victors, but Chelsea certainly don't like being behind. 72 mins Holy smoke! Duff hooks a ball across the area which Drogba swings at and misses, Wright-Phillips gathers and sends it back across goal, where Essien slides in alongside a Betis defender and watches the ball ping off first one post then another before being gathered by the Betis goalkeeper. 75 mins Terry halts a Betis cross with his arm and the hoops have a free-kick right on the right hand corner of the penalty area... Joaquin flights it in and when it ends up in front of Capi 18 yards out he draws a comfortable save from Cech. Betis won't care particularly as long as they can keep the ball away from their own end. 78 mins Essien bullets the ball into the back of the net after turning Juanito, but he did so thanks to a hefty kick, so it won't count. Dreadful keeping from Contreras, so he'll be mightily pleased. 80 mins Terry came forward in the last attack and hasn't headed back - Essien instead dropping into the defence. His first act there is to go up with a well-aimed elbow. 83 mins Irrespective of the 'boring' debate, I'd say this is the worst performance I've seen from Chelsea in a good while. They've been ragged all night and as the last 10 minutes tick down, they're almost frantic, it's alien to watch. And now there's more aggro after Gallas sends Dani flying - Lampard rushing in in full Anglo-Saxon mode. Capi makes way for Fernando, meanwhile. 85 mins Wright-Phillips gets a yellow card for his umpteenth high foot (well, about as high as he can probably get it), and he'll miss the next game. Shame, as he's been sparkling at moments since he came on. 88 mins Lampard is undone by exactly the excellent hassling he usually brings to a football match and immediately stops and waves his arms at the referee. Meanwhile Betis break and Ferreira's foul allows Betis a bit of time to lie on the floor and see down the clock. Liverpool are 3-0 up, by the way. 90 mins Joaquin wins a free-kick after taking a tumble amid three chasing Chelsea players - and Duff gets booked for dissent he's so annoyed by the decision. Unsurprisingly they push the ball into the corner, but Chelsea force a throw. 91 mins Dani gets a booking for charging down a Chelsea free-kick, but it's all time-wasted, eh? Contreras punches clear with Drogba bearing down on him, but the punch is enough to see Betis out of trouble. There's 90 seconds left. Eek! 93 mins Chelsea free-kick just inside the half in the dying seconds, but Contreras again punches clear and the final whistle goes. Betis go ballistic and I don't think even Jose Mourinho can find a way of making this anything other than a defeat for Chelsea. Teams Paulo Ferreira has come into the Chelsea line-up in place of Asier del Horno, while Damien Duff starts on the bench a mere sneeze since knee surgery. A muscle injury keeps Hern\u00e1n Crespo from the fray. Real Betis benefit from the return of Melli and Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez, both of whom missed the Primera Division game against Real Madrid at the weekend through suspension. Xisco Mu\u00f1oz loses out to Capi. Real Betis 1-Pedro Contreras; 7-Fernando Varela, 4-Juanito (c), 16-Nano, 27-Melli; 17-Joaquin, 18-Alberto Rivera, 8-Arzu, 24-Edu; 14-Capi, 12-Ricardo Oliveira. Chelsea 1-Petr Cech; 20-Paulo Ferreira, 6-Ricardo Carvalho, 26-John Terry (c), 13-William Gallas; 5-Mickael Essien, 4-Claude Makelele, 8-Frank Lampard; 10-Joe Cole, 22-Eidur Gudjohnsen, 16-Arjen Robben.
