He recalled poring for hours over video footage of a goalkeeper who offers reassurance to Bayern Munich and Germany, and spoke of how imposing the elder statesman is with his positioning and reading of the game. \u201cHe is a frame, someone you have to stand back and admire,\u201d said the young pretender. \u201cHe gets in the right positions, blocks it with whatever he can, and has led the way. He\u2019s someone I look to take things from.\u201d On the basis Neuer is a World Cup and Champions League winner who is likely to add a fourth Bundesliga title to his list of honours in the next few months, he should be considered a role model. Butland, after all, counts an Under-17 European Championship, claimed with England in 2010, as the only notch on his trophy tally. This is an aspirant coming up against a stellar performer at the Olympic stadium on Saturday. And yet the more eye-catching comparison centres on the respective journeys undertaken by Stoke City\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper and the man six years his elder to reach this stage in Berlin. These players have come to personify the difference in approaches between the English and German models: Neuer as a player whose talent was recognised early and harnessed at Schalke and Bayern Munich; Butland as the highly rated junior forced to tread a nomadic route via temporary spells at Cheltenham Town in League Two and, even once he had commanded a \u00a34m fee to join Stoke, in the Championship with Barnsley, Leeds United and Derby County. The 23-year-old is coming to the end of his first full season as a Premier League No1 but, like so many in Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad, can point to character-building spells out of his comfort zone in the lower leagues as key to his development and progress. Butland and plenty of his England team-mates have been forced away from their parent clubs to forage for themselves. Fraser Forster, now recovered from his split knee cap and a goalkeeper who recently broke Southampton\u2019s club record by going 708 minutes without conceding a goal, can point to five loan spells and Tom Heaton, drafted in as Joe Hart\u2019s replacement, to six that have brought him to this point. Ryan Bertrand, named in the original squad but withdrawn on Thursday through injury, has already spent time at eight clubs with those temporary switches from Chelsea earning him his regular involvement at Southampton. Danny Rose and Harry Kane have cut their teeth in the lower leagues despite being contracted to Tottenham Hotspur, and it took Danny Drinkwater four loans away from Manchester United to convince Leicester City to recruit him on a permanent basis. Once settled he has thrived, though his previous first-team experience had always revolved around six-month deals or, once, a season-long switch to Huddersfield. There have been 55 loan spells, and 89 transfers of some kind, among the 23-man England party who convened on Tuesday. These are players who, whether schooled initially in elite club academies or not, have learned their trade on the road at 53 different clubs, toughening up in teams from Stocksbridge Park Steels to Swindon Town, Royal Antwerp in the Jupiler Pro League to Maidstone in the Isthmian League. Contrast that with Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s world champions, a 27-man squad who have cut their teeth at 39 clubs and enjoyed 50 career moves between them. If the swansongs enjoyed by Mario G\u00f3mez at Besiktas and Lukas Podolski at Internazionale \u2013 lucrative switches by seasoned professionals late in their respective careers, as opposed to moves that may be considered an education for youngsters \u2013 are excluded, the Germany players have five loans between them. That is fewer than each of Butland, Heaton and Bertrand. Therein lies an indication of the success being made developing and playing youngsters across the Bundesliga, a league that has not been as flooded by foreign recruits as much as the money-flushed Premier League, as well as an illustration of the quality in L\u00f6w\u2019s options. There is pedigree in his ranks to which the English still aspire. In England, youngsters have often found passage into first-teams protractedly barred and, of late, coaches have made a habit of bemoaning the state of the under-21s development league. The trend has been for promising players to be farmed out in the hope that the most talented prove their quality and earn a chance back in the elite. Ross Barkley, Rose and Kane did just that. Others, like Gary Cahill, have taken a more scenic route back into contention, establishing themselves away from their original clubs before rising back to the top. Hodgson will hope it has made them more streetwise, perhaps hungrier for success, and that will be to the national team\u2019s benefit. It is a relatively new trend for a national manager to digest. The side who started England\u2019s opening World Cup fixture against Paraguay in Frankfurt a decade ago \u2013 a lineup picked by Sven-Goran Eriksson and dominated by the perceived Golden Generation \u2013 had 73 league appearances from loan spells between them with Peter Crouch contributing 29 of those at Dulwich Hamlet, IFK Hassleholm and Norwich City. That number had swollen to 102 by the time Fabio Capello\u2019s side lined up against the USA in Rustenberg four years later. Bertrand alone has 183 these days, and only six members of Hodgson\u2019s squad have not been loaned out at some stage. The numbers say more about the system than anything else but they do offer an insight into how this England squad have been forged, and the common experiences many of the players share. Butland, who played 76 league games on loan from Birmingham and Stoke, has seized his chance in the Potteries to such an extent that his club rewarded him with a five-and-a-half-year contract last week. \u201cAs soon as I was given the opportunity it was: \u2018Head down, this is what I want. This is where I want to be,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was always confident I\u2019d take it.\u201d These same players will feel the same way about what awaits in Berlin on Saturday and, beyond, at the European Championship. Settled after years establishing their reputations on the road, they have finally arrived. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 March 2016.
