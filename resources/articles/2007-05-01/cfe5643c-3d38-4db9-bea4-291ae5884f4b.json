The land was just as green and Tony Blair was in his shirtsleeves as well, then as now, starting his day with a rallying pep talk to party workers in London before a final day's campaigning in sunny Scotland, just like he did on the eve of that other election in 1997. Ten years ago, though, victory beckoned, and the future on May 1 1997 was lush with possibilities. Yesterday it was electoral defeat that loomed instead and just about the only story about Mr Blair that commands the headlines 10 years on is the date of his departure. A decade ago he didn't have a police motorcycle escort to ease him swiftly through the red lights and the London traffic the way he did yesterday. In 1997 the Guardian's Hugo Young got the final eve of poll interview with the Labour leader in his election battle bus en route for Stansted and Edinburgh. Yesterday there were no formal newspaper interviews to mark the Blair decade, but the destination was Edinburgh once more as the prime ministerial motorcade headed out to the airport and the flight north. Phrase of the day Mr Blair had started his anniversary day with a lightning trip to the GMTV studios where the schedulers squeezed him in between the Kate Moss Topshop collection and Britain's Eurovision entry. Then it was back to political basics with a rousing visit to party workers at Labour's Victoria headquarters, which featured a cameo appearance by John Prescott, the forgotten man of British politics. The deputy prime minister waved his pledge card as if it was 1997 all over again and celebrated \"a decade of delivery\". Mr Blair, though, was determined to look to Labour's future, despite having no part to play in it. He had crafted his own phrase of the day too: that Britain was \"stronger and fairer and better\" than it had been when Labour swept the Conservatives out of office on May Day, the people's day, 10 years before. Edinburgh is an important city in the prime minister's life and career. It was where he was born, 54 years ago next week, in the maternity wing of the Royal Infirmary. It was where he went to school too, as he reminded the audience in his big set piece speech of the day at Edinburgh Corn Exchange just before lunch. And it was where one of the key photographs of the early Blair era was taken, as he emerged from John Smith's funeral in May 1994 and his shadow cabinet colleagues sensed that the mark of leadership was suddenly upon him. Those marks have taken their toll on Mr Blair over the intervening years, turning him from fresh-faced opposition leader to careworn prime minister, as he admitted yesterday. \"When they showed the pictures of me in 1997 on the TV this morning, the then and now was a little too graphic,\" he said. Yesterday he was in Edinburgh for strictly political - not nostalgic - reasons. Labour has had a tough few months in the campaign for the Scottish parliament which Mr Blair's government created as almost its first legislative act in 1997. For weeks now Labour has trailed the Scottish Nationalists in a contest that many have seen as the voters' chance to send Mr Blair packing. Yet if the party faithful want to see the back of Mr Blair they gave little sign of it yesterday. Their activists gave him a hearty standing ovation when he arrived. Ten years ago Labour votes were easy to come by everywhere in the land. Now Mr Blair is having to scrap for every one, almost for the first time in his career, and yet he gave every impression of enjoying himself. He may sound a little hoarse, as a politician ought to as the end of an election campaign nears, but he weighed into the Nationalists in his Edinburgh speech, dismissing them as grievance politicians, and it was clear that Labour think they are on to something with this line of attack, even before this morning's polls offered some confirmation. Innocent cruelty There was just time for a whistlestop campaign visit to the Beardsley family in Shandon Street, where Mr Blair chatted in the family kitchen. \"Are you looking forward to your retirement?\" asked Jen Beardsley with innocent cruelty as she tried to stop her son Zach from climbing into the family microwave. \"I am as a matter of fact,\" Mr Blair replied, not wholly convincingly, \"It's a long time, 10 years.\" Then it was on through comfortable Edinburgh streets to a cup of tea with the Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, in a cafe close to the church where Mr Smith's funeral took place. Then it was back to the airport, London, government and calls to foreign leaders. \"I always felt a bit detached from all that first of May euphoria 10 years ago,\" Mr Blair told me as he headed home. \"I knew things would be very difficult. But if you had offered me the balance sheet of Labour's successes over the last decade, even including the things we haven't got right, then I'd certainly have said 'Bloody hell, yes.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
