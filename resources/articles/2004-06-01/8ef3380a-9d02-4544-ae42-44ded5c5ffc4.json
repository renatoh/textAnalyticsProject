Russia's 2-1 defeat of Greece coupled with the Portuguese victory has ejected Spain prematurely from yet another major tournament. Greece have proved a surprise-package by securing a quarter-final berth after their second-place finish. An inspired substitution from Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari sent Nuno Gomes into the fray. Gomez promptly popped up to score the 56th minute winner that brought the Jose Alvalade Stadium to life. His powerful 22-yard strike was too good for Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain, who only needed a draw, failed to show the same spark as in their previous games and paid the highest price. Spain attempted to find the equaliser and had two glorious chances in the 74th minute. Costinha was forced to make a vital clearance with Raul's close-range looping effort going over Ricardo. Seconds later, Juanito's angled header from the left of the area struck the crossbar. Three minutes later, captain Figo received a warm ovation as he left the pitch with Benfica's Petit taking his place in midfield. With 10 minutes remaining, Saez brought on striker Fernando Morientes with Juanito coming off. Time was running out for Spain, who surged forward but were unable to find a good finish and it was Portugal that were proving more dangerous. With two minutes remaining, Nuno Valente's cross found an unmarked Costinha inside the area but his poor header was off-target. Seconds later, Maniche should have sealed it for Portugal but his strike that had forced Casillas to come off his line was cleared off the line by Raul Bravo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
