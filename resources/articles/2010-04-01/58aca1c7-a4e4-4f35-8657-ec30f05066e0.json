The Philadelphia Daily News, under the headline: \"Condemnation erupts over ballpark barf case\" reports how Matthew Clemmens allegedly \"cursed, spilled beer and even spat either on Michael Vangelo or his two daughters\" then: \"announced his intent to vomit, stuck fingers down his throat and directed the stream toward Vangelo and his younger daughter.\" He has since been dubbed \"Pukemon\". Clemmens was restrained and arrested, and some witnesses suggest he may have been punched in the process \u2013 his mug shot taken later suggests there is some substance to the claims. Unsurprisingly, given the Phillies reputation, the mainstream US media jumped all over the story with CBS Sports, Fox Sports and ESPN making it their lead item. Uncle David Clemmens soon weighed in, calling Allentown Morning Call to profess his nephew's innocence: \"He's a good kid, and I think he just had a couple extra beers that might have got him a little sick \u2026 He accidentally vomited.\" Accident or not, it prompted the Daily News to run a poll all last week asking: \"What is Philly sports fans' all time low?\" Alongside \"Vomit Guy\", the options include: \"Snowballs at Santa\" \u2013 from the infamous 1968 incident when fans booed and then bombarded a man attempting to spread Christmas cheer; \"Batteries at JD Drew\" from the considerably more dangerous throwing of said objects at a player who had declined to sign for the team and \"Looting Robinson's Luggage\" \u2013 when ecstatic Philadelphians decided to redistribute the city's wealth \u2013 in the form of suitcases \u2013 during a night of mayhem and vandalism after the Phillies won the World Series in 2008. \"Vomit Guy\" has five times more votes than the final option: \"None \u2013 Philly fans are the best!\" Supporters are fighting back, however, with Clemmens becoming the subject of two Facebook groups. The first, inviting members to pour scorn, features his mug shot above the simple words: \"I feel sick\"; while the second, includes the same picture with the word \"Loser\" superimposed on it, above the collective's feelings: \"This piece of human waste doesn't represent Phillies fans, people from New Jersey, human beings, or any living creatures on earth, including pigs.\" Legal dispute threatens Nigeria's World Cup place Nigeria are facing a possible ban from participating in the World Cup, and potentially a suspension from international football, over a dispute with Fifa, reports Leadership Nigeria. Fifa issued a warning of sanctions after a suit was filed in an Abuja High Court by Dr Sam Jaja over his disqualification from the Nigeria Premier League board elections. A former board member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Dr Jaja took legal action after opponents barred him from contesting the elections, and Fifa does not approve of football federations being in court. Fifa statutes require that all football matters should be settled outside the law courts, and NFF spokesman Ademola Olajire says they have been sent a statement explaining the governing body's position: \"We request the Nigeria Football Federation to ask for an immediate withdrawal of the claim and, in case of non-compliance by the claimant, to take sanction against him. We remind you that if the NFF does not comply ... that violation of obligations by any member may lead to sanctions.\" Olajire believes the threat of Nigeria being banned from football and being unable to compete in the World Cup is real. \"It is clear that one man's ambition is threatening the country's World Cup participation, as Fifa's sanction is usually in the form of suspension of a member association,\" he said. The national squad, which includes several Premier League players, is preparing to hold a training camp in England, and the NFF president, Sani Lulu, and coach Lars Lagerback are addressing dissatisfaction with the proposed Super Eagles' base camp in Durban. Nigerian daily NEXT confirms that the chief executive officer of the 2010 organising Committee, Danny Jordaan, has agreed that Nigeria are free to change their base camp if unhappy. \"We have 46 base camps and Nigeria can choose whichever they want,\" he said. Lulu will return to South Africa at the end of this month to make a decision. Whether the team makes it that far will depend on successfully resolving their internal dispute. Outside the courts. Sumo Grand Champion set to bloom at Chelsea The AFP in Tokyo raised eyebrows last week when it quoted an un-named source revealing that the recently retired Sumo grand champion, Asashoryu, is set to pursue a new and somewhat unlikely career path with a plan to take part in next month's Chelsea Flower Show. The Mongolian-born Asashoryu (literally, Blue Dragon of the Morning) had a remarkable career, winning 25 Emperor's Cups, the third highest in the sport's 2,000-year history but, also, in a nation where champions are expected to be societal role models, earned a reputation as its bad boy. He has been accused of continuing a fight with an opponent in the communal bath, pulling the topknot of another and was the first Grand Champion to be suspended, having pulled out of a goodwill bout due to injury, only to be filmed playing in a charity football match days later. Problems came to a head in February, when he retired following allegations he had attacked a man outside a Tokyo nightclub \u2013 an incident the wrestler's stable master said he could not remember, because he was too drunk. Asashoryu will be at the Show with the renowned Japanese gardener Kazuyuki Ishihara, an old acquaintance with whom he \"agreed recently to work together at Chelsea\" because the former champion wanted to learn about gardening. The gardener will present his design \"Kazahana\", which means \"a light snow flurry from a cloudless sky\" at the event in May with the Blue Dragon, who has taken to horticulture and south west London, because he \"has dreams of creating forests in Mongolia,\" says the source. Real making hay as Ronaldo sales pay off Just before kick-off at the Bernab\u00e9u last week, where Real Madrid went on to defeat Valencia and come within one point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga, the club announced it had just sold its one millionth Cristiano Ronaldo No9 shirt, notes Portugal's A Bola. The club reveals it has now sold more than 1.2m shirts (at \u20ac40 each) in the Spanish capital and that, with millions more shirts and Cristiano memorabilia purchased worldwide, they are already on their way to recouping the \u00a380m transfer fee. After his unveiling at the Bernab\u00e9u, the club shops sold 2,000 shirts in two hours, with a further 300 reportedly stolen. Real say they have generated \u00a3100m in Ronaldo-related income already, and, although it is a gross total, the figures suggest that his six-year tenure at the club will more than cover the cost in merchandising alone \u2013 quite apart from how the player performs on the pitch. Intriguingly The Times of India also picked up on the story, choosing to emphasise that the figures were higher than those of David Beckham in his first season at the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
