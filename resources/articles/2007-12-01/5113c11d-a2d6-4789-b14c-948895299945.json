Hutchinson will receive a demand later this week from Raymond McCord that his office interview the two top policemen over the case of convicted loyalist paramilitary Mark Haddock. McCord's son Raymond Junior was killed by the UVF unit Haddock controlled. He wants the Ombudsman to ask why Haddock was kept on as a Special Branch informer almost three years after he was exposed as committing crimes while serving as a paid state agent. Under the legislation established at the time the Ombudsman's office was set up, the police overseer's inquiry team must investigate all complaints from the public about policing matters in Northern Ireland. Earlier this year, the first Police Ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, revealed in her Operation Ballast report that Haddock carried out several murders, beatings and gun attacks while working for the security forces. In her report, she found Haddock had been paid \u00a380,000 for information, even while his Mount Vernon UVF unit conducted a reign of terror in North Belfast and Mid Ulster. McCord, whose son was beaten to death by the Mount Vernon gang on Haddock's orders 10 years ago, will hand in a letter to the Ombudsman this Wednesday which he wrote to Orde in 2000. Based on information from a senior RUC officer, the letter revealed that Haddock was killing and ordering murders while being a agent of the state. He wants the Ombudsman to probe why Haddock remained an agent until 2003. 'I want to ask Al Hutchinson to bring both Hugh Orde and Ronnie Flanagan into this investigation. This is much more than just my desire to get justice for young Raymond. There were other families affected by the Mount Vernon UVF; they deserve to know why the man ordering the deaths of their loved ones was a paid agent right up to 2003,' McCord said. The human rights campaigner will be accompanied to the Police Ombudsman's office on Wednesday by Paul McIlwaine, whose son David, along with Andrew Robb, was beaten and stabbed to death by the Mid Ulster UVF in 2000. McIlwaine is making a separate complaint on Wednesday over allegations that the UVF's commander in Tandragee, Co Armagh, was allowed to work on security forces' bases, despite being a suspect in the double murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
