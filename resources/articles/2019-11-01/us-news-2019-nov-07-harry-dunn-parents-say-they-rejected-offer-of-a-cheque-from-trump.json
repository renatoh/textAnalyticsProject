Anne Sacoolas was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road before the collision with Harry Dunn on 27 August outside RAF Croughton where her husband worked. After the crash, Sacoolas, 42, left the UK against the wishes of the Foreign Office, claiming diplomatic immunity under a relatively obscure agreement covering the base. The Dunn family\u2019s spokesman, Radd Seiger, told PA Media that their meeting at the White House on 15 October ended with the president saying the secretary of the treasury, Steven Mnuchin, was \u201cstanding by ready to write a cheque\u201d. Seiger added: \u201cIt was almost as if he let it slip out. When he said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the driver here\u2019, he basically meant we\u2019re all going to have a big hug and a kiss and I\u2019ll get my treasury guy to write a cheque. That\u2019s how it was. On the day it just didn\u2019t register with me, but the more I think about those words, the more shocking it is.\u201d On Thursday, Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, and his father, Tim Dunn, met the Northamptonshire police and crime commissioner, Stephen Mold, to discuss their dissatisfaction with the force\u2019s investigation into their son\u2019s death. Afterwards, Charles said of Trump\u2019s offer: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to bring Harry back. Justice has to be done. They all need to learn that this can\u2019t happen again and they need to learn that things need to be put into place to stop this.\u201d She said she remained determined that Sacoolas return to the UK to face justice. \u201cIt is frustrating \u2013 they must see there\u2019s something not right. Why are they making it difficult?\u201d During the visit to the White House, Trump ruled out Sacoolas being sent back to the UK but also revealed that the diplomat\u2019s wife was in the next room and tried to persuade them to meet her. They refused and later said they were unimpressed. Last week Northamptonshire police submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service after interviewing Sacoolas in the US. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said last month that the government believed diplomatic immunity \u201cclearly ended\u201d for Sacoolas when she left the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
