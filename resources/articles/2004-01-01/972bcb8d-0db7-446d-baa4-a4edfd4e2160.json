Both the government and the BBC were plunged into chaos by the David Kelly affair, but he ultimately finds that the government acted better in the circumstances. His reading of events is quite simple. Andrew Gilligan made \"unfounded\" claims against the government on the Today programme and the BBC failed to hold a serious investigation into the complaints it put to them. As the row intensified, Dr Kelly came forward and his government employers issued a press release to avoid accusations that it was seeking to shelter an important witness from the committee of MPs that was investigating the truth of Gilligan's allegations. After this, he says, \"the controversy surrounding Mr Gilligan's broadcasts was so great and the level of media interest so intense that Dr Kelly's name was bound to become known to the public and it was not a practical possibility to keep his name secret\". So that is how it happened. Nothing \"dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous\", just a government reacting in the best way it could to events. For the most part, Lord Hutton stays out of the report that bears his name. He divides it into 12 chapters, each dealing with a different issue, such as the writing of the dossier or what happened when Gilligan met Dr Kelly at the Charing Cross hotel, and explains what happened through excerpts from the evidence heard and seen by his inquiry. Sometimes this is pure narrative. The first third of the 328-page report begins with Dr Kelly's interview with BBC Newsnight science editor Susan Watts on May 7 and ends two and a half months later with the discovery of his body in an Oxfordshire wood. In the latter stages, extracts from Dr Kelly's evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee are followed by comments his daughter made to the inquiry. \"He just seemed utterly exhausted. He was really, really tired,\" she said. Lord Hutton does not blame anyone for Dr Kelly's death. He says it was suicide and, while the government scientist was subject to pressures and strains in the last week of his life, \"none of the persons whose decisions and actions I describe ever contemplated that Dr Kelly might take his own life\". Dr Kelly is subject to criticism. It is not that the report lacks compassion, rather that Lord Hutton sees where the scientist broke the rules. He refers to the 1996 Employment Act's definition of \"protected disclosure\" but says that does not cover what Dr Kelly told Watts or Gilligan. He says that he was acting in breach of the civil service's code of procedure when he spoke to the journalists. But he is especially critical of Gilligan. He says he had no basis for saying that the government put in the 45-minute claim knowing it was wrong or that it was a late entry into the dossier because the intelligence services were unhappy about using a single-sourced item. Lord Hutton is satisfied that Dr Kelly told him nothing of the sort. Gilligan later admitted the mistake but that makes little difference, the mistake was made. Lord Hutton is also not interested in the continuing failure to find WMDs in Iraq, simply the controversy that arose after that single allegation \"attacking the integrity of the government\". He states that whenever a reporter intends to broadcast or write anything that impinges on the reputation of others his managers should ensure that the wording is correct and that it is right to run it. \"The right to communicate such information is subject to the qualification (which itself exists for the benefit of a democratic society) that false accusations ... should not be made by the media,\" he says. The BBC's editorial system takes as much blame as Gilligan. Why, he asks, if the BBC knew the seriousness of the allegations Gilligan was about to make (he quotes a 6am news broadcast trailing the story) did no editor see the script he intended to read from. This lack of \"proper editorial control\" was followed by a failure to investigate government claims that the allegations were false. He says the BBC's editorial management failed \"to appreciate the gravity of Mr Gilligan's allegations reported in the 6.07am broadcast\". The governors come off as badly. They were correct to take the view that it was right to protect the BBC's independence but wrong to not investigate the complaints, not matter how strongly worded Mr Campbell made them. By contrast, the government acted well, according to the report. The MoD is rebuked for not informing Dr Kelly it was to make his name public but that is about it and Lord Hutton even explains how he came to this view. \"For a time at the start of the inquiry it appeared to me that a case of some strength could be made that there was a strategy [to leak Dr Kelly's name],\" he writes. \"However, as the inquiry proceeded and I heard more evidence about the surrounding circumstances and the considerations which influenced those in government, I came to the conclusion that the reality was that there was [not].\" Mr Blair is cleared of every charge. Even that allegation that he was lying when he told reporters on a flight to Hong Kong that he played no role in the naming of Dr Kelly is dismissed. Lord Hutton says the prime minister agreed to issuing a statement but the question and answer material was not prepared in Downing Street. The judge, satisfied that there was no \"underhand or duplicitous strategy\", offered no criticism of Geoff Hoon; Lord Hutton agrees he was not at the crucial meetings he insisted he did not attend. The BBC suffer and the government are cleared. In the terms in which Lord Hutton has written his report, you get marks for acting well in difficult circumstances. He believes that the broadcasters, not the politicians, were too bogged down in their row to behave in the proper manner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
