It reveals a lot about a man. And golf reveals a lot of ugliness in this president.\u201d Reilly, the former Sports Illustrated columnist, has written a book called Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump. It\u2019s rattling good fun which also depicts the startling duplicity of the president as a golfer. \u201cYou\u2019re mostly laughing,\u201d Reilly says, \u201cbut at times you\u2019re crying \u2013 how did this happen? As a golfer he really offends me. Cheating? Hate that. Driving carts on greens? Hate that. Wearing old dockers two sizes too small for him? Give me a break. Kicking your ball so often the caddies call you Pel\u00e9? I so hate that. Most of all I hate how stupid he\u2019s making my country look. I hate what he\u2019s doing to my planet. I hate what he\u2019s doing to kids at the border. I don\u2019t mind Republicans. I just can\u2019t stand this guy. I love golf and he has set the game back 30 years. Just when it was becoming cool with Rory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler we get this fat bozo cheating his ass off.\u201d Dr Lance Dodes, a Harvard psychiatrist, tells Reilly that Trump is \u201ca very ill man\u201d who \u201cexhibits all the traits of a narcissistic personality disorder.\u201d Reilly sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible he should cheat at golf which is the one sport where we self-regulate. There are referees in every other sport but in golf, if you\u2019re 200 yards away, you can kick the ball and get away with it. I called the National Golf Foundation. They said 90% of golfers don\u2019t cheat. Golf is an honest game but this guy leaves a big ugly orange stain on it. It really pisses me off.\u201d Reilly\u2019s anger towards Trump is made more interesting by the fact they have known each other for so long and that he admits he once almost liked the billionaire. \u201cI liked him as a writer because he\u2019s a crazy fabulist who tells lies so big they can float in the Macy\u2019s parade. He\u2019s great copy. If he says, \u2018Can you be here tomorrow for an interview?\u2019 I\u2019d be on the red eye. I would do anything to get that interview but if I had to play golf with him again, and it wasn\u2019t for an article, I\u2019d never do it. \u201cThe first time I met him we were playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am [in the late 1980s]. He comes over and says, \u2018It\u2019s Rick Reilly, the greatest sportswriter in the world.\u2019 There\u2019s always an angle with Trump. Marla Marples was his wife then and she said, \u2018He\u2019s your biggest fan. Look!\u2019 She pulled one of my columns out of her purse like this is a set up. He wanted me to write a column about him but I had this idea of writing a book where I caddie for famous people. So we make a day for me to caddie for him but I turn up and he didn\u2019t have anybody to play with. So I played him. That was the day he took the only gimme chip in I\u2019ve ever seen. A chip is a gimme? Trump\u2019s pretty good off the tee but he chips like Edward Scissorhands. He\u2019ll cheat you on the course and then buy you lunch.\u201d Trump introduced Reilly to other people after their game. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t just call me a writer. He\u2019d say, \u2018Meet Rick \u2013 he\u2019s the president of Sports Illustrated.\u2019 He would introduce me to another guy. \u2018Hey, Rick, meet Luigi \u2013 voted best hamburger chef in the world.\u2019 Luigi\u2019s like \u2018What? No, I wasn\u2019t.\u2019 Trump wants to be a winner by pretending you\u2019re someone huge. \u201cHis lies were hilarious until he becomes the most powerful man in the world. Then it got scary. I don\u2019t know what his plan is for my kids and grandkids. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to pay off this giant debt he\u2019s created to give his fat-cat buddies a tax cut. Look what he did [last] week in London. He pissed off two of our best allies. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d Trump\u2019s deceit about his golfing achievements motivated Reilly to resume writing. \u201cI was retired, living in Italy for three months a year, drinking Campari. I kept seeing on my Twitter feed [Reilly mimics Trump]: \u2018I\u2019m a champion. You should vote for me because I\u2019ve won 18 club championships.\u2019 Whoa! That\u2019s a lie because you already told me how you did it. Whenever you open a new course, you play by yourself and declare yourself the first club champion.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s a shitty lie.\u2019 \u201cHe even said: \u2018This is against the best players in the club. No strokes given\u2019. What? I played with you. You\u2019re a 10-handicapper at best. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re winning a club championship. I soon discovered many of them are senior championships for guys over 60 or 70. That\u2019s a nice honour but it\u2019s not within a par 5 of beating the club\u2019s best players. Lots of guys said he wasn\u2019t even in town when some championships were decided. He claimed to have won a tournament in New Jersey when he was actually in Philly. My dad would flip over three times in his grave and he was a Reagan Republican.\u201d What would Reilly\u2019s father, who loved Jack Nicklaus, have said if he heard Trump claim his handicap was lower than the 18-times major winner? Trump insists he plays off a 2.8 handicap, while Nicklaus, aged 79, admits his handicap is now 3.5. \u201cMy dad would say, \u2018I\u2019ll take Nicklaus, you take Trump, and the loser has to sweep the streets of New York for the rest of their lives.\u2019 Do you know how Trump does it? He has recorded only 20 scores in eight years even though he plays more golf than any other president. I put in my every score in the computer because that\u2019s what you do in golf. At my club guys will put in your score for you if you\u2019re avoiding it. Trump doesn\u2019t put in scores. That\u2019s so unethical.\u201d He rolls his eyes when I say Britain can hardly claim to have an ethical prime minister in Boris Johnson. \u201cAre you kidding? Trump makes your guy look like Churchill. That guy [Johnson] looks like a genius.\u201d Reilly has clearly enjoyed writing about Trump\u2019s shameless shenanigans but he is disappointed the president has remained unusually silent about his book. \u201cThis guy will tweet about a bad postcard but I can\u2019t get a tweet to save my life. If he did tweet I know what he\u2019d say. \u2018Rick Reilly? I kicked his ass. He swings like a girl. This is FAKE NEWS!!!\u2019 He\u2019s got a buddy in LA who\u2019s also my buddy. They talk once a week. My buddy\u2019s said: \u2018Don\u2019t get in a Twitter war with Reilly. You\u2019ll look stupid. And don\u2019t say a word about the book. You\u2019ll just fuel sales.\u2019 I said to my buddy: \u2018Who asked you?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve offered Trump a $100,000 charity bet to play him. He has not responded. I\u2019d bet my house I can beat him as long as there is a camera on both of us but he\u2019s not going to play me. He\u2019s not going to testify to the impeachment hearing because he can\u2019t stop lying. And when you lie in front of Congress, you go to jail for perjury. As soon as he plays me in front of TV cameras it would come out how bad he is.\u201d Trump likes to denigrate his enemies as losers \u2013 and so the final line of Reilly\u2019s book suggests that, when the president looks at his reflection, he will see \u201cthe face of a loser.\u201d Reilly nods. \u201cThat was on purpose. My dad always told us that if you cheat then, ultimately, you\u2019re cheating yourself. I wanted that to be the last word in the book because he is a loser. He\u2019s the biggest loser I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Rick Reilly\u2019s Commander in Cheat is published by Headline"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
