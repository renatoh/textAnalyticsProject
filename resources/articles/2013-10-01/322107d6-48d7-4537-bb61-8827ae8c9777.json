Some members of society share (and overshare) so much information on social platforms that they leave little to the imagination. So-called \"lifestreaming\" was popularized some 6 years ago, but the ubiquity of Facebook, Twitter and the like has made the concept all the easier. Andy Warhol famously said, \"In the future, everyone will have 15 minutes of fame.\" But with the amount of personal details that we make readily available to the public, the opposite is closer to the truth. And why shouldn't it be? As humans, we all have a need to feel heard and acknowledged. The public sharing and affirmation that come with it would seem to be a natural extension. However, recent announcements by Facebook and Google should make users think otherwise. Facebook announced that it is changing its search parameters and now your name, profile picture, gender and cover photo will be readily accessible through search. In the case of Google, as a registered user, your name and face can be used in ads in conjunction with product recommendations that you've made. To their credit, both platforms have informed users how to avoid such privacy pitfalls with instructions of how to set up posts or how to opt out. But in reality, how many average users will take the time to not only understand the nuances but also to make the changes to their accounts based on the instructions? Certainly, Facebook and Google are hoping that few will - indeed, their advertising models are based on that. Marketers should hope for the same, as shared personal information is what makes Facebook so highly targetable and Google ads so human and personal. If large numbers of users defect from these practices or platforms, it may be of concern to marketers. In an era where \"everything that happens in Vegas stays on Google,\" it's risky to have such a loose grasp on privacy. There may be ramifications much farther down the road that no one has yet foreseen. Then again, if you don't want your online ramblings, rants or antics to be public, perhaps you shouldn't be posting them online in the first place.
