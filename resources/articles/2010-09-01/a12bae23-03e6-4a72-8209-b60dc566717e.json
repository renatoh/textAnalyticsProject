In the first week of June, ignoring several almost habitable old nests, one pair began to rebuild a structure of which only the barest marks remained. It took them almost a full week to complete. In bursts of activity throughout the day, the birds swooped up to the nest site with gobbets of mud held in the bill, puddling each load into precise contact with previous additions. As each day's work dried, the structure took on a banded look not unlike a geological section. By the second week of July, the nestlings were visible \u2013 two at a time \u2013 at the mouth of the nest with their broad yellow bills and spiky new plumage. They gradually became less gawky, growing to resemble their parents more closely \u2013 so that during August it became difficult to tell whether we were seeing the adult birds or their offspring at the entrance. I missed the day that they took their first flight but slowly became aware that the parents were no longer bringing food to the nest. Over the last few days house martins have been feeding intently across nearby pastures, during the gaps between the sharp, insistent showers that have been sweeping down the valley. Renewed activity around the nest made me wonder whether a second brood might be imminent, although the recent colder, wetter weather might seem to make this a risky strategy. Today I heard the new nestlings calling out for the first time, and fresh droppings have appeared below the nest. The entrance, worn by heavy use, has been rebuilt and the traffic of house martins carrying food has begun again. It isn't clear yet whether members of the first brood are contributing to this activity, but the investment of effort by the parents in the solid construction of the nest seems to have paid off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
