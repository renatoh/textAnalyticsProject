It started sunnily enough with me walking, sunbathing and swimming on a beach on the beautiful island of Pangkor. I did manage to burn my ankles, hitherto covered by either trousers or walking socks, but it was lovely to just relax. That was the last rest I achieved as half of the insect/reptile/rodent life of the island decided to join me in my chalet that night. Normally fairly ok about creepy crawlies I confess to terror at the scampering, rustling and chomping that was going on around me in the dark. It was no good burying my head in my sleeping sheet, and I ended up just dozing with the light on all night. Even that was interrupted by torrential rain that started in the small hours and carried on until late morning. No last sunbathe and swim before returning to Kuala Lumpur. The rest of the week I have been tasting how the other half holiday. My sister Maureen and her husband Ray changed their original plan to use a timeshare week in Cuba to meet up with me in KL. So I have been staying in the second bedroom of the executive suite at the holiday resort. Impressed? I am with the swimming pool, maid service, FREE internet (although it doesn't work very well), bar (drinks very expensive) and restaurant (food very expensive). What's more they have hired a car, so no more hanging around bus stations trying to interpret timetables that are meaningless anyway, no more bone-shaking buses, just cruising along with air-con and Rachel's new tape that they brought with them. Sunday saw the usual late afternoon heavy shower. Walking through Chinatown, a kind stallholder decided to poke the rain off his tarpaulin - right on top of my head. I had my second hair wash of the day and was the sole entrant in the wet t-shirt competition. I still fail to see what Maureen, Ray and everyone else in the vicinity found so hysterically funny. Monday we drove to the Cameron Highlands along the winding roads lined with forest, passing wooden villages and roadside stalls covered with fruit. Maureen and Ray at last felt they were seeing the real Malaysia. It was beautiful in the Highlands, the steep slopes full of tea bushes with forest all around, the air cooler and fresher. We visited a tea plantation and saw the process by which the tea ends up in the teacup. Gone are the women in saris and coolie hats - the young leaves are now cut with a strimmer. We had a local 'steamboat', a sort of Chinese fondue where you cook all the raw fish, meat and veg in a pot of boiling soup in the middle of the table. A bit too many fishy slimy things for me, but I ate up all my vegetables. I returned the compliment by introducing Maureen and Ray to 'budget' accommodation in the delightful town of Tanah Rata. They took it well, only commenting on the lack of coffee-making facilities and the fact that you could see through the towels. On the second day we were walking in the forest when again the heavens opened with a vengeance. We must have looked a strange sight trying to huddle under two umbrellas, but we got soaked anyway. Maureen definitely won the t-shirt competition this time. Wednesday it rained virtually all day. We drove back along the Selengor coast road intending to see the fireflies in the evening but it never stopped raining. I am sure I heard Maureen and Ray muttering something about Cuba. One stop we did make was to buy one of the peculiar hairy things for sale along with the fruit on all the stalls in the Highlands. Bruce has offered to send a pawtograph to anyone who can tell us what it is (see picture gallery). Thursday at last the sun shone and it was back to Selengor, first to the Taman Alam nature park, a birdwatchers' paradise. At times like this I feel very ignorant as huge predatory and small wading birds swoop around unnamed. On that beautiful night we took the river boat at Kuala Kuantan to see the fireflies. It was another of those magical experiences that will stay with me. Millions of fireflies turned a long stretch of riverbank into a forest of dainty Christmas lights, twinkling in harmony. With the stars above and the reflection in the water it was breathtakingly beautiful, leaving us spellbound and speechless. Thank goodness we made the second attempt to see it. Today I am in Melaka, a fascinating place that I should be looking round, but instead I'm in a net cafe writing to you - one of the few disadvantages of interactive travelling. Tomorrow I leave for Bali. When I originally booked this trip, I left myself a lot of time in this part of Asia, intending to go to Thailand or even further afield. I have ended up spending it all in Malaysia. I do not regret this as I feel I have had a real taste of this lovely country with its magnificent scenery, friendly hospitable people and delicious food. Bruce has asked me to thank everyone for his emails, especially class six at Highfield Special School (read the email), who allowed Bruce to come with me. He would like to answer them himself but hotmail have not yet been able to recruit a programmer who is bearlingual. Maybe one day. We both enjoy reading all the emails and just wish there was more time to answer them all properly. It really seems as though we have a lot of companions with us every step of the way, which feels good. Thank you all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
