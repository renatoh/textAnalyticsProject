But she was one of the country's leading 20th-century poets, as well as an essayist, playwright and performance artist. When the Nazis came to power, she sensibly decided that as a Jew and a \"degenerate\" creative type she would be better off abroad, moving first to Switzerland, then to Palestine. My Blue Piano (2.15pm, Radio 4), by Marty Ross, imagines Lasker-Sch\u00fcler's last 24 hours, in Jerusalem in 1945. Ida Schuster stars in this mix of comedy, tragedy and fantasy. The best Philip Dodd can manage, meanwhile, is Jarvis Cocker. In Night Waves (9.30pm, Radio 3), Pulp's frontman tells him about growing up in Sheffield, moving to Paris, fatherhood, middle age and, of course, p-o-p. Fleshing out the interview are contributions from occasional bandmate Richard Hawley and muso Paul Morley. If that doesn't float your musical boat, there's always Bob Dylan's attempt to reinvent himself as a DJ. This week's Theme Time Radio Hour (9pm, 6 Music) is inspired by fathers; tracks include Shep &amp; the Limelights' Daddy's Home and the Temptations' Papa Was a Rollin' Stone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
