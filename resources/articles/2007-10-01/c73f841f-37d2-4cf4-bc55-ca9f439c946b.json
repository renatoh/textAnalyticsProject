Except that the legendary 'rain queen' is dead and her daughter and heir, Masalanabo, has been spirited away by the little girl's father, who believes her life is also in danger. Makobo, the sixth Queen Modjadji, died suddenly in 2005 at 27, leaving a vacuum in which a vicious battle is now being fought for control of her kingdom and its resources. This month's rain-making ceremonies will take place anyway, but under the auspices of the late queen's brother, 25-year-old Mpapatla, whom a faction of the Royal Council is trying to install as regent until Masalanabo grows up. But Mpapatla is young and reckless. What's more, for the past 200 years the 400,000-strong Lobedu tribe has been ruled by a hereditary female dynasty. You can see why the Modjadji legend has persisted. Her realm is a hilly, fertile oasis in the middle of the drought-ridden north-east of South Africa. Trees hang heavy with paw paw, nectarines, mangoes and bananas. Crops flourish, irrigated by streams that seldom run dry. Makobo was only 25 when she ascended to the throne in 2003. She was the first queen to have been educated, to speak English, drive a car and operate her own bank account. She also chose her own lover and insisted on living with him openly. This was to prove her undoing. Rain queens are allowed lovers, but they have to be kept secret. In the old days a brother or cousin would be chosen to impregnate the queen. 'Today the queen makes her own choices, but the children will not have the identity of the father,' says John Malatji, acting head of the Royal Council. He also has no official status as her partner. 'Queen Modjadjis were never allowed to marry. In the old days the boyfriend would be slaughtered when she ascended the throne,' said Malatji. 'Lovers must be a well-guarded secret.' Not so with Makobo. Her lover, David Mohale, not only lived openly with her in the pink palace, but she also acknowledged him as father of her baby daughter. The Lobedu sometimes compare themselves to the British royal family, but even though Elizabeth II's realm dwarfs that of Modjadji the rain queen has more power. She holds title to all Lobedu land and no development can take place without her say-so. But there are some similarities with another tragic young royal figure: like Diana, Modjadji bucked a powerful, conservative monarchy. Makobo's death certificate says she died of meningitis, a common illness affecting those with a compromised immune system such as is caused by Aids. She believed, however, that she was being poisoned. As does her boyfriend. Mohale grew up a few miles from the palace, but he represented a different world. A political activist at school, he fled the country to avoid arrest and spent 16 years in the US before returning to South Africa in 1998. An ANC stalwart, he got a job as manager of Modjadjikloof municipality, which encompassed the Lobedu area. Under apartheid, schools, clinics and roads had been paid for by taxes levied on the local people by tribal leaders such as Queen Modjadji. Now taxes were paid to the government and facilities provided through municipalities. The Lobedu are now more than adequately provided with schools, clinics and an excellent regional hospital. Mohale would have been the face of these modern miracles. And it was in this guise of provider that he met Makobo. She, in turn, was playing the part of the caring traditional leader, in touch with her people and their needs. Mohale describes their meeting. 'It was in 2001. I was approached by some women. They asked if I could assist someone in one village who had lost his house.' One of the women was Makobo. 'The following day I went to see what was happening and she was there. We became friends.' They became more than friends. Makobo risked everything to be with him and their relationship survived for five years, despite intense pressure to break it off. When Makobo was crowned rain queen in 2003, Mohale moved into the pink palace with her. Even more controversially, he set himself up as gatekeeper against those of her people who came soliciting her signature. 'They wanted tenders. There were promises to build factories, industries. One man wanted her to list all her wealth, all her property and sign it over to a trust. Some were rejected because I told the queen not to sign.' This provoked intense anger against the couple. Mohale believes her death was caused by poisoning and says attempts were made to poison him, too. Some say Mohale manipulated the queen for his own ends, but many Lobedu believe that, by flouting tradition, they angered royal ancestors and have put the entire community at risk. But Mohale has the trump card, Masalanabo, rightful heir to the throne, and he has hidden her somewhere no one can find her. \u00b7 This is an edited extract from 'At Risk: Writing On and Over the Edge of South Africa', edited by Liz McGregor and Sarah Nuttall (Jonathan Ball Publishers)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
