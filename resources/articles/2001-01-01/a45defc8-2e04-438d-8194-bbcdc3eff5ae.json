When the experienced Burnley striker Andy Payton struck in the 72nd minute of an entertaining replay last night it looked certain to set up a local derby against Bolton but Scunthorpe deservedly took the tie into extra-time with an 82nd-minute free-kick from 25 yards. It was the least Town deserved for an impressive performance which belied their Third Division status. They had shown their threat with a 68th-minute shot from Bjarni Larusson, which was turned on to the post by keeper Nik Micholoupos. Postponed seven days earlier because the Glanford Park pitch was frozen, the tie was again in doubt until an hour before the kick-off last night. A floodlight failure was eventually repaired as fans were queuing to get into the ground. The electricians' intervention was timely because this developed into an entertaining match on a greasy surface which contributed immensely to the action. Scunthorpe, in particular, relished the conditions as they again refused to be intimidated by a team two divisions above them. They had been impressive in the first tie which slipped away from them with a Burnley goal in the dying seconds of stoppage time. They continued in the same vein last night. Lee Hodges, a bubbly and abrasive midfielder, was particularly influential. He almost made the breakthrough in the final minute of the first half when Michopoulos diverted his angled shot into the side-netting. Michopoulos had already dealt capably with free-kicks from Andy Dawson and Larusson. Burnley's only response came on the half-hour when Payton threatened to break clear before he was robbed by a superbly timed tackle from Nathan Stanton. Hodges, a \u00a330,000 signing from West Ham, kept Town ticking over in a second half which became increasingly fraught for the First Division side. Within five minutes, he set up Larusson for a 20-yard shot which troubled Michopoulos, then the midfielder cut inside to force the best save of the match from the Greek keeper on the hour. Burnley's manager Stan Ternent responded by sending on Glen Little for Paul Cook, but his first contribution was a booking for protesting after claims for a penalty were turned down. Scunthorpe United (3-5-2): Evans; Jackson, Stanton, Wilcox; Sheldon, Larusson, Hodges, Calvo-Garcia (Graves, 73min), Dawson; Torpey, Ipoua. Burnley (3-5-2): Michopoulos; Cox, Davis, Thomas; Weller, Ball, Cook (Litton, 50), Johnrose, Branch; Moore, Payton. Referee: G Frankland. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
