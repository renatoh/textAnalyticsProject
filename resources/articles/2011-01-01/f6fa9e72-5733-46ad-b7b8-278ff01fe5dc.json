Ferguson has identified the Dutch international as the best option despite United's goalkeeping coach, Eric Steele, marginally preferring the Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from Schalke 04. David de Gea, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Spanish under-21 international, has been discounted because of his inexperience, with Ferguson deciding it was imperative to bring in an older man to take over when Van der Sar retires in the summer, at the age of 40. The 6ft 6in Stekelenburg, at 28, fits the bill and has big-match experience after being part of the Dutch team who reached the World Cup final last summer. \"Stekelenburg is indeed the goalkeeper who is at the top of our wanted list,\" Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, United's first-team coach, said. \"We have naturally been talking a lot among ourselves about who should replace Van der Sar. Alex Ferguson has spoken about Stekelenburg with Edwin and that does not seem strange to me at all.\" Van der Sar has given his compatriot a glowing recommendation, having seen him come through Ajax's academy, making his first-team debut nine years ago, and also being ahead of him for the Dutch team before retiring from international football. United plan to turn their admiration for the Haarlem-born goalkeeper into a hard bid and, if Ajax can be persuaded to let him go, the Premier League leaders hope they have found the right man to make sure replacing Van der Sar is a lot smoother than it was finding someone to fill the void left by Peter Schmeichel. \"I made a mistake,\" Ferguson said today. \"I should have bought Van der Sar then [in 1999] but I didn't do it. We will be better prepared this time. We have learned from that.\" The ramifications are likely to lead to Tomasz Kuszczak's departure, with the Pole unhappy about being permanently viewed as an understudy. Anders Lindegaard would then be the second-choice goalkeeper, followed by Ben Amos. Ferguson must also consider Dimitar Berbatov's position considering that the Bulgarian turns 30 on Sunday, an age when centre-forwards can start to see the finishing line and United footballers tend to be steered towards one-year contracts. There are 17 months remaining on the one Berbatov signed on transfer-deadline day in the summer of 2008, although Ferguson is in no hurry to start negotiating a fresh one. \"His contract is not an issue for us,\" he said. \"I don't know how long it's got but it is not an issue.\" Berbatov's two goals at Blackpool on Tuesday, preserving United's unbeaten Premier League record, were his 18th and 19th of the season. His two previous campaigns at Old Trafford had brought him a combined total of 21 league goals. \"He is playing with great confidence and that's always the case with strikers who are finding the net,\" Ferguson said. \"When they are in that kind of form, you hope it lasts. He could easily get to the 30 mark this season.\" This summer will see a major turnover of personnel at Old Trafford. Gary Neville will also retire, whereas Owen Hargreaves and Michael Owen are unlikely to be offered fresh contracts. Wes Brown may also be offloaded, while there are doubts whether Patrice Evra will stay in England. However, Ferguson can see Berbatov remaining in Manchester for the foreseeable future because his game has never relied on speed. \"Teddy Sheringham had no pace, Alan Shearer had no pace and they were great strikers,\" he said. \"Ruud van Nistelrooy wasn't quick but he was a really good goalscorer. It's all about what happens in the penalty box. \"Some players are quick up top in the penalty box \u2013 they only need a yard. Allan Clarke at Leeds was that type of player. He could move and take positions quickly. You don't necessarily need to be quick to be a top striker and the most important change for Berbatov has been in his confidence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
