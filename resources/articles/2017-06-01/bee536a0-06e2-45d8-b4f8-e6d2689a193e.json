Bureau of Statistics data show labour\u2019s share of gross domestic product has fallen to 51.5%, down from 54.2% in the third quarter of last year. At the same time, the profit share of GDP has risen from 24.5% to a five-year high of 27.5%. Paul Dales from Capital Economics said Australian households had not seen \u201cone cent\u201d of the extra income generated by recent soaring commodity prices because \u201cit\u2019s all gone into the pocket of business\u201d. He said the share of national income going to households was now \u201cwithin a whisker\u201d of a 50-year low and a meaningful cyclical or structural upturn in that share of income was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d if jobs growth and wages growth remained so low. \u201cThe share of the economic pie that households currently enjoy isn\u2019t just small by Australia\u2019s own standards, it\u2019s also small by international standards,\u201d Dales wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAs a share of GDP, the compensation of Australian employees lies towards the bottom of the international ladder. That\u2019s not always been the case. \u201cBack in 1975, Australia households received a bigger share of the economic pie than households in the US, France and New Zealand. Only in the UK did the compensation of employees account for a larger share of GDP. \u201cBut the downward trend in labour\u2019s share of GDP over the past 40 years has been more marked in Australia than in those other economies, apart from New Zealand.\u201d This trend in most economies was mainlybecause of structural changes that had reduced the bargaining power of employees, including globalisation, the increased flexibility of the labour market and technical innovation, which had flattened firms\u2019 cost curves, Dales said. \u201cBut the larger decline in Australia may be partly because of the rise in the importance of the mining sector, which tends to generate relatively large profits while employing relatively few workers,\u201d he said. The news comes as the British Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says the face of British politics has changed after Theresa May\u2019s snap general election leaves Britain with a hung parliament 11 days before Brexit talks begin. \u201cPeople have said they\u2019ve had quite enough of austerity politics, they\u2019ve had quite enough of cuts in public expenditure, under-funding our health service, under-funding our schools, our education service, and not giving our young people the chance they deserve in our society,\u201d Corbyn said. In Australia, the Labor party is developing a position on the negative economic consequences from persistently low wages growth, with broader policies to crack down on worker exploitation. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, signalled plans on Thursday to strengthen the bargaining power of workers and unions in an attempt to revitalise stagnant wages. Her intervention in the low-wages debate followed a speech last month by Brendan O\u2019Connor, Labor\u2019s employment and workplace relations spokesman, in which he Labor\u2019s intention to make it harder for employers to terminate enterprise agreements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
