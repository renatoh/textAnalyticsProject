The freshness of invention, with one striking idea after another, demonstrates Prokofiev's astonishing ability to work under the most severe mental stress and remain his highly individual self. As in other late works, he eked out his ideas with material drawn from earlier pieces. A warm, colourful performance such as this from the BBC Philharmonic under Gianandrea Noseda, makes one appreciate that The Stone Flower deserves a place in the repertory even alongside Prokofiev's two balletic masterpieces, Romeo and Juliet and Cinderella. The variety of mood is a delight, with incidental divertissements developing naturally in the telling of the story of the hero, Danilo, in search of the stone flower - symbolic for the artist's search for an ideal. The chain of numbers over four acts ends in a triumphant Adagio and a bold epilogue with a touch of Hollywood in it, all vividly presented in this opulent recording."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
