The national team went crashing out of the Women's World Cup in spectacular fashion at the BayArena in Leverkusen, Germany, after squandering a one-goal lead before missing two penalties in the quarter-final to send France through to the last four. Football fans had hoped the curse of penalties, which has long plagued the men's game, would not extend to Hope Powell's squad as England looked to advance into the semi-finals. But like the 1998 men's World Cup, when Paul Ince and David Batty missed their chances against Argentina, the women's team were also defeated 4-3 on spot kicks. England's chances looked promising after goalkeeper Karen Bardsley saved the first shot from France's Camille Abily to give the team the upper hand, but misses from captain Faye White and defender Claire Rafferty sent the French through. Powell said after the match: \"It was a gallant effort and there were some really tired legs out there today. Our games have been tough and we were dead on our feet at the end. I am very proud of my players. They did their very best to take it to the wire. Unfortunately when it came down to penalties, you just had to applaud France.\" The men have failed to make it through to the next round of the World Cup in the three matches that have gone to spot-kick deciders. They lost 4-3 to West Germany in 1990, 4-3 to Argentina in 1998 and 3-1 to Portugal in 2006. Now England's woeful form in World Cup shootouts has crossed the gender divide. The women's team almost overcame France thanks to a moment of brilliance from Jill Scott, who followed her great effort against Japan in the previous round to net a superb goal in the 58th minute of normal play. The side were three minutes away from a place in the last four, but France kept up the pressure and were rewarded with an equaliser courtesy of Elise Bussaglia that forced the match into extra time. Another 30 minutes of play failed to separate the two sides so it went to the familiar denouement, culminating in an agonising spot-kick decider that saw the penalty shootout curse come back to haunt England as Rafferty dragged a penalty wide and White smashed the crossbar. But the players remained positive about their achievements after exceeding expectations to secure a place in the quarter-finals following their 2-0 defeat against tournament favourites Japan on Tuesday. Midfielder Scott said: \"I think we've got to be proud of ourselves at the end of the day. It's just a shame that it had to end with us going out on penalties. Obviously we've been practising them a lot, but you can't practice taking a penalty in a quarter-final.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
