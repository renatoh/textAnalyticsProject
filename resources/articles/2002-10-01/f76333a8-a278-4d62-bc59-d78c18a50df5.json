Yet fewer houses are being built today than since 1924. If we continue at our current pace, 1.5m households (3m people) could be without their own home by 2027. In a new exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects - Coming Homes - the whole idea of what is a home, and how it should - or could - be built, is under examination. 'People's perceptions of inner-city living have shifted,' says Rob Wilson, who has curated the show. 'There's a choice now. In housing, somehow it's been stuck. I don't think it's going to change overnight, but it's on a curve. Good design is being written into government policy. It's a starting point.' Now that we've been shown every possible way of decorating our homes on the inside, with television house makeover programmes seemingly every hour, on the hour, it's time to turn our attention to the way our homes look from the outside. The idea is to showcase the many possibilities, to both the public and the housing industry itself. Part of the exhibition is devoted to a display of eight models of innovative contemporary projects - new houses that are either completed or under construction. Needless to say, there's not much for Prince Charles here. Not one of them is a classical brick box. There isn't a mock-Tudor beam or a Georgian column in sight. But they each have their roots in the traditional English house, whether it's the 30s semi, the Georgian town house, or the mobile home. According to a recent Mori survey conducted for Cabe (the government-funded Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment), the bungalow is every Brit's ideal home: 30 per cent of us would like to live in one. We like the fact that it doesn't have stairs, and have a certain nostalgia for the idea of the perfect pre-war bungalow. Ellis-Miller Architects have, however, taken the bungalow idea far away from its cosy image. Their single-storey house is constructed from steel and glass, and looks more like a miniature airport than a suburban bungalow. But sadly, if we were all to have our own perfect bungalow, however chintzy or sexy, we would very rapidly run out of land to build them on. Whether we like it or not, high-density housing is the way forward. For the Manchester-based architect Ian Simpson, that means a return to the tower block. Before you start screaming and hollering about the horrors of high-rise living (in the Cabe survey, precisely nobody chose the tower block as somewhere they would like to live), Simpson does have some very good reasons. His tower block destined for Holloway Circus, a roundabout in central Birmingham, will become the city's tallest building at 40 storeys (his original plans to make it 48 storeys, with a high mast, were scuppered after 9/11) and will house 150 apartments on top of a 220-bedroom hotel. 'We wanted to build an elegant, sculptural form from a very small footprint,' says Simpson. The 6,000sqft piece of land would be big enough to fit just eight conventional houses. 'It's a more sensible use of rundown and derelict brownfield sites. It's a more sustainable way to build our cities.' The tower will have its own specially developed, fully glazed skin, to maximise light in and views out. Each apartment has been oriented towards the south where possible, with floor-to-ceiling windows. Within the tower, there will be a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments, 25 per cent of which will be 'affordable housing', available on a shared ownership basis, and peppered throughout the block. The problems of security and vandalism in public areas will be scuppered by a 24-hour concierge, and the number of corridors has also been limited to a minimum. Simpson hopes that by elevating the apartments above ground level, he will raise them above the hostility of the city streets below. And just to prove that he knows what he's talking about, Simpson himself has recently moved into an 18th-floor apartment of the 22-storey Manchester apartment tower block he designed, Number One Deansgate. 'One of the advantages is sunlight all the time,' he says. 'And you get a fantastic aspect across the city. It's very tranquil and relaxing. I can't see any other way forward as land values get more restricted. We need to increase the density of our city centres.' Building on the Holloway Circus Tower starts next March, and the completion date in May 2005. If you are still not convinced about living with your head in the clouds, how about a more down-to-earth town house? Though there is nothing conventional about the East London town house built by Fat architects, with a maisonette for a family of three, an office and a separate apartment. From the front, it looks like a caricature of what a house ought to look like - the equivalent of a child's drawing, complete with Georgian windows and a chimney - with a three-storey office block on top. Or what about a cottage by the sea? The Riba prototype is a beach house in Dungeness, still under construction, and built from the basis of a 30s fisherman's hut. Inside, it will be clad in plywood, while the exterior plays on the area's traditional felt and tar finish, but using black rubber instead. Perhaps one of the most accessible houses on show is the m-house, a very crafty bit of house building that is actually a mobile home, so does not need to comply with conventional planning and building regulations. The mouse (as it is pronounced) might have four wheels, but it is far from your typical caravan. It comes in two pre-fabricated sections which have to be bolted together on site. The whole thing, designed by architects Alex Ely and Michael Howe, takes just 12 weeks to construct from the time of ordering it, and once it arrives on site, only a few hours to 'zip' together. Unlike most caravans or mobile homes, it is designed to have a long lifespan of 50 years. Tim Pyne, whose concept the m-house is, intends to have two, one in the Kent countryside, and one to be moored as a houseboat. 'You get a lot of space for your cash,' he says. The m-house is experiencing some preliminary teething problems, but Pyne already has a list of 120 clients eager to place orders. It appeals to people who have land and want to use it for an extra office or granny flat without having to go through the expensive and long-winded procedures of planning and architect's plans. He has also had an enquiry about using it as a travelling exhibition, and another as a village post office. 'There are thousands of places in this country where you can put a caravan,' says Pyne. 'And this is legally the biggest caravan you can find.' It is 18ft wide and 57ft long, providing an area of 1,000sqft. An empty shell with toilet and kitchenette will cost \u00a3105,000. The caravan status means there is no VAT or stamp duty to pay. Of the 3.8m new homes that are built over the next 25 years (if we ever get round to building them, and don't all simply order a couple of m-houses for our families to spill into), the grim fact is that the majority will be built around questions of cost first and foremost. Design, and certainly innovative design, will always come second. The protoypes chosen for the exhibition may be the exception rather than the rule, but if curator Rob Wilson has his way, the seeds for change have been sewn: 30 per cent of us might prefer to live in a bungalow, but 72 per cent also believe that well-designed homes will increase in value more quickly. And the chief executive of Wimpey (the company currently working with Wayne Hemingway on an innovative, design-led project for the Staithes South Bank housing development in Gateshead) was one of the speakers invited to open the show. Perhaps the architects are coming down from their ivory towers after all, and the building developers - the ones responsible for reshaping our domestic and urban landscape - might actually get to meet some of them. \u00b7 Coming Homes runs until 11 January 2003 at Riba, 66 Portland Place, London W1 (0906 302 0400)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
