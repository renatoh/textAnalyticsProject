The Italian worked diligently for four seasons at Stamford Bridge without ever having the charisma of a Jose Mourinho. At Juve he is blessed with a top-class goalkeeper in Gianluigi Buffon but his other experienced players \u2014 from Alessandro del Piero to Pavel Nedved \u2014 are well past their heydays. Three seasons ago, Juventus came to Highbury and were dispatched comfortably by Arsenal, their evening ending in a shameful display of petulance. They will need to keep their discipline this time and play at their best to stand any chance. Chelsea will just be pleased to have avoided Barcelona but they will recall how they struggled in Roma in the group stage when they took their eyes off the ball, and this is a team that has not won away from home in Europe for over a year. However, with four semi-final appearances and the heartbreak of Moscow still fresh, they will be determined to nail this one. They are certainly capable of progressing. Head to head Giorgio Chiellini v Jose Bosingwa Bosingwa's wonderful acceleration and speed has been tempered recently by an erratic quality of cross. When Chelsea play narrow, the Portuguese still gives them tremendous attacking options down the flank whilste Jon Mikel Obi holds. Chiellini, at 24, is a much coveted player making big strides with his no-nonsense defending whether employed at full-back or centre-half. He is likely to be positioned wide for this tie, making this an intriguing touchline clash Verdict Chelsea's motivation and maybe Drogba's return to the fold should see them past a team that has not done enough to challenge at the top of Serie A this season. REAL MADRID v LIVERPOOL Juande Ramos has much to do at the Bernab\u00e9u. He has inherited an ageing, injury-torn group with the experience of Guti and Raul less effective than in previous years. Drenthe is yet to settle into any consistent form in Spain, whilst Arjen Robben and Ruud van Nistelrooy are out of action. Lagging behind in the table, Ramos is unlikely to turn this around immediately even with the additions of Lassana Diarra and Klaus Jan Huntelaar, and will be perturbed at the prospect of taking on the strong Spanish connection at Liverpool, who will relish the chance to challenge a once great Real. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, born in Madrid, and Fernando Torres, who played so effectively for rivals Atl\u00e9tico, have their own motivation and will particularly look forward to the tie. On Sunday Barcelona's magical three \u2014 Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry \u2014 tore into Real, whose goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, was fabulous to limit the damage to a 2-0 defeat. Spain's first-choice goalkeeper will need to be at his best yet again against Liverpool, particularly if Steven Gerrard is employed just off the rampaging and fully fit Torres. Head to head Ra\u00fal v Jamie Carragher Ra\u00fal refuses to go away. The veteran continues to pull away brilliantly at the back post well into his twilight years with a calm, clinical mind still potent. The Spaniard's positional play will test Carragher and he is a talented left-footed finisher. Physically Carragher \u2014 all heart and no-nonsense defending \u2014 will probably come out on top but the centre-half must snuff out hishis threat early to blunt Real. Verdict Liverpool to progress, again benefiting from the second leg being at Anfield where they will be roared on by their 12th man. ARSENAL v AS ROMA AS Roma will be determined more than ever to progress, given the prospect of the final being played at their Olympic stadium. Mirko Vucinic is a dangerous striker and should not be underestimated as he cuts in from the left with deceptive speed and an ability to finish calmly. Much of the interest will surround Francesco Totti and the ex-Arsenal player, Julio Baptista, and Roma, currently 10th in Serie A, will be written off by many even though they dispatched Chelsea recently on a cold night in Italy. Chelsea had when the visitors had a sleepy second period that evening and were surprised by their hosts' revival. Luciano Spalletti had been left in a tenuous position prior to that game. He has since recovered his reputation to a certain extent, even if the team has not progressed this season as much as had been predicted. Arsenal must rediscover their group play, disturbed as they have been by the absence of their wingers Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky. Whether the Christmas and new year results demonstrate the Gunners as harder to beat might prove the key. At the moment, and with the second leg away from home, one hesitates to make a strong case for Arsenal. Head to head Emmanuel Adebayor v Philippe Mexes The Arsenal striker has had a mixed season since his controversial pre-season comments, so this will be an ideal opportunity for him to remind everyone of his talents against the improved Mexes. The Frenchman, a product of the Auxerre stable, has been this side's linchpin as a centre-back covering for the likes of the attacking Cicinho, who runs on down the right, and complementing the adaptability of Christian Panucci. Mexes' influence is strong. Unsettle him and Roma can be undermined. Verdict Roma, a counter-attacking side, could well be the one Italian team to break the English stranglehold at this stage. INTERNAZIONALE v MANCHESTER UNITED Critically, the second leg of this tie comes at Old Trafford. The brooding, brilliant if supercilious Jose Mourinho will no doubt play mind games with Sir Alex Ferguson \u2014 shrewd, tough and bullish \u2014during the build-up. On the field Sulley Muntari can supply Inter's key passes and complements that skill by breaking from midfield with a creative left foot. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, likewise, is a stealthy striker. But United, who have bad memories of San Siro having lost there crucially in 2005 and 2007, will fancy their chances. In the group stage Inter were defeated by both Werder Bremen \u2014 who somewhat surprisingly failed to qualify \u2014 and Panathinaikos. Although hanging on to No1 spot in Italy, there have been several discomforts at the club this season, not least with the president LucianoMassimo Moratti's difficulties in handling the egotistical Mourinho. United's forward talent and the venue of the second leg should sway this tie but one can never underestimate Mourinho's tactical awareness and the gift of a gambler in making early decisions so early into a 90-minute contest. Head to head Zlatan Ibrahimovic v Nemanja Vidic The tall striker has put much of his individual arrogance aside as he has matured and he will now play combination football where once he was selfish. Very talented The Swede against the Serb. with the ball, his spindly frame makes him a difficult opponent but Vidic \u2014 tough, with great spring and strong tackling\u2014 should still stamp his authority on the duel. Verdict Manchester United to go through with the benefit of the second leg at Old Trafford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
