The sort of things I am interested in are those in Carol Klein's recent feature, particularly the pink cow parsley and fritillaries. There are very many lovely little nurseries that supply choice herbaceous plants by mail order. Special Plants in Wiltshire supplies the coveted pink cow parsley. For a catalogue, send five second-class stamps to: Hill Farm Barn, Greenways Lane, Cold Ashton, Chippenham Wiltshire SN14 8LA. For bulbs, you will need to go elsewhere. Choice Landscapes, in Cambridgeshire, sells loads of bulbs and a huge selection of fritillaries. For a catalogue, send six first-class stamps to: Priory Farm, 101 Salts Road, West Walton, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire PE14 7EF. If you catch the specialist nursery bug, buy yourself a copy of the RHS Plant Finder (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a314.99), which lists hundreds of plants and the mail-order nurseries that supply them, or go to rhs.org.uk. We planted three rows of 'Autumn Bliss' raspberries on our allotment two years ago. The fruit so far has been disappointing - crumby and partly developed. The other plots have good, large fruits. What could be wrong? The heat and drought of last summer would have hit at the same time as the fruit was forming, and this can affect fruit size. The most likely explanation, however, is virus. There are several that affect raspberries, and one of the symptoms is distorted fruit that doesn't fully develop. 'Autumn Bliss' should flower and fruit in its first year, so I would guess they were infected when you bought them (try your supplier for a refund or replacement), although there is a possibility of infection via aphids after planting. I'm afraid they will need to be dug up and new canes planted elsewhere on the plot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
