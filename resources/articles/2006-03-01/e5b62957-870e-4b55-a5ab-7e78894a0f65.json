Former French army helicopter pilot Christophe Fauviau had confessed to the crime during the trial in Mont-de-Marsan in south-west France. Fauviau, 46, was accused of drugging his children's opponents 27 times in tournaments across France from 2000 to 2003, using the anti-anxiety drug Temesta, which can cause drowsiness. Opponents of his children complained to investigators of having weak knees, dizziness, nausea or fainting and several needed hospital treatment. Then in 2003, Alexandre Lagard\u00e8re, a 25-year-old schoolteacher, died after losing control of his car on the way home from a tournament. He had pulled out of a match against Col Fauviau's son, Maxime, then 15, after complaining of feeling sick and had slept for two hours before making the fatal drive home. Police believe he fell asleep at the wheel. Toxicology tests showed traces of Temesta in his system, allegedly delivered by Fauviau, who has been in custody awaiting trial since his arrest in August 2003. Earlier today a prosecutor requested eight to 10 years imprisonment. Prosecutor Serge Mackowiack described Fauviau as \"an adult who turned his children into objects of his own fantasies of success\" and whose actions were premeditated. \"Nothing stopped you: Players collapsing on the court, the sight of gurneys, of an 11-year-old girl, a young woman who collapses against a fence. Nothing stopped you,\" Mr Mackowiack said. The charge of unintentionally causing death by administering toxic substances carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Explaining why he was asking for less than the maximum sentence, the prosecutor noted that Fauviau had been a good soldier and said he did not seek to kill or injure his children's tennis rivals. Giving evidence last week, Fauviau asked the parents of Mr Lagardere for forgiveness. \"It's something that completely took me over, and I couldn't imagine that I could be responsible for the death of your son,\" he told the court. \"I never wanted things to come out like this.\" There is no indication that Maxime, and his sister Valentine, who was 13 at the time, were aware of their father's actions. Valentine has continued her promising career since her father's arrest but Maxime had never been highly rated as a tennis player."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
