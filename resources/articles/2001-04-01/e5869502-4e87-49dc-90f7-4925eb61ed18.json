Or your best friend? Most women have. I have. Female relationships and friendships come under scrutiny in this latest show from Frantic Assembly. A cross between The Yellow Wallpaper, Goldilocks and every tacky slasher movie you've ever seen, Nicola McCartney's clever script turns up the tension on a sweeping tide of female hysteria. Cool, bitchy Marcia and warm, psychic Sarah arrive to spend the weekend with their psychologist friend Georgina and her apparently disturbed sister Lydia in Georgina's newly inherited isolated farmhouse. Soon the girls are playing with a Ouija board and the lights go out. This is probably the only theatre show, as opposed to a movie, that I've found myself watching partly through my fingers, which is a tribute to TC Howard's brilliant choreography and the body-in-the-bath staging. The evening is finely judged so that although it sends up the horror film genre, it also generates real terror. In the end there may be less going on beneath its slick surface than you might imagine, and it's a pity McCartney's script doesn't opt for a more ambiguous ending. But where this scores is in the way it explores internal rather than external threats - the way love and hate are intimately connected and the person you love and rely on can also be dangerous for you. At its best, this is a psychological exploration of that old horror story where the frightened girl alone in the house locks all the doors, only to discover she has locked herself in with the thing she most fears. For how can you escape your own mind? Superbly performed by its cast of four, this is a gripping, sassy, accessible piece of theatre. Because they were refused funding Frantic had to beg the money to do this London gig. In the programme Trevor Nunn is acknowledged as one of those who dipped into his pocket to help. A sweet gesture, but it would be sweeter still if this show was at the National, where a run would bring a tide of under-30s into the building and liven up the place no end. \u0095 Until April 28. Box office: 020-8741 2311. Then touring to Wakefield, Birmingham, Edinburgh and around Britain until June 9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
