Out of superstition I had avoided even trying to find out whether it was going to be in Korea or Japan and exactly when it was to be played. I can't pretend that the news, which reached me when I was in Korea on May 24, didn't fill me with an intense feeling of satisfaction. I've said that all matches are equal. Well, some are more equal than others. The interest in and importance of this one were clear to everyone. This was a game that went beyond football. To have such an important match entrusted to me confirmed how I was considered within the game and this was something of which I was very proud. However, I immediately had the feeling that, as with all things in life, there was another side to the coin - something far less gratifying and certainly more worrying: the element of risk. To start the World Cup with such an important, demanding match, under the spotlights of the entire world, might also present a problem.If it were to go badly, then my World Cup might be seriously compromised. Wouldn't it have been better to start off with a quieter match, with a greater chance of everything running smoothly? But faced with a choice between challenge and fear I never have any doubts: I'll take the challenge every time. Some hours before the official announcement [of my appointment to the match] rumours had been going round that my name had been seen alongside the match on a TV graphic that had been put up by mistake and was then immediately removed. But I was faithful to my old habit of celebrating, even to myself, only on receiving confirmation. After the list was published there was a press conference and we referees were given permission to speak to journalists - something that happened only three times throughout the tournament. The vast majority asked to speak to me - further proof, if any was needed, of the importance of the match. But two weeks were to pass from that day until Argentina and England met on the pitch. There was plenty of time to get ready for the game. One part of preparing to referee, apart from training and developing concentration, is to watch a match. There were three stadiums near my base in Tokyo - Yokohama, Ibaraki and Saitama - all just a few hours' coach ride away. Two matches involved Argentina and England and at least one of them was within easy reach for me, but I chose instead not to go and see either of them. Perhaps this was to avoid developing a preference for one team over another; perhaps so I could watch both matches live on TV and start getting ready, right from the very beginning, for my turn. For a referee an essential part of getting ready for a match is to do some research. The first thing I try to memorise when I study a game on television is how the teams play, the tactics they use on the pitch, both for defending and attacking. It's important to understand how their games progress, how the various moves are played out, to observe how they deal with their set pieces, their free-kicks and corners. I then move on to an analysis of individuals, because carrying out a game plan depends on the characteristics of the various players. To put it simply, I'm convinced that the more you study, the easier your task as a referee becomes. Obviously watching a match live isn't enough, so a video recording becomes essential, as it lets you see all the moves repeatedly, allowing you to focus attention on the most important moments in the game. Research requires time and commitment but it pays dividends in the long run. This need for knowledge is why I try to have at least one training session in the stadium in which I'm going to referee the following day, especially if I've never been there before. Only in this way did I manage to get to know the new surroundings [of the Sapporo Dome], the different smells and sounds, so as to avoid being taken by surprise during the game itself and suffering the effects of disorientation. Despite the fact I was refereeing in Japan, the game was almost like being \"at home\" because in both teams there were players I'd refereed many times in the past. This was not just confined to the Argentinians who play in the Italian league but also included many of the English players whom I'd often met in European, international and club competitions too. There was no danger of language problems as I speak Spanish and English and with many of the Argentinians I could speak Italian quite happily. In fact, in this case too, knowledge helped - reciprocal knowledge - because this logic also works to the players' advantage. It gives them peace of mind and eliminates, or at least diminishes, any communication problems and, consequently, the possibility of error. If you add respect and trust to language skills, the cocktail is perfect and it can give you the help you need to referee a good game. A player who knows you and appreciates you, for example, will tend to take any error of judgment you make on the pitch in his stride. Knowledge can also help you get out of difficult situations, or situations that might put players and the referee into conflict. It might be by making a funny comment when you know there's no danger of being misunderstood. During Argentina-England I remember that, as we were going back on to the pitch after half-time, Gabriel Batistuta was complaining about having been booked after 12 minutes. Clearly it wouldn't have been a good idea for me to go into the reasons for my decision but, knowing Batistuta well, I opted for a joke that might calm him down. The booking had been called for by my Canadian assistant and I said to the Argentinian forward: \"Of course you know the real reason why the assistant had you booked?\" He looked at me and I added: \"He is Canadian but he's originally from Chile,\" joking on the rivalry between Chileans and Argentinians. Batistuta replied: \"Ah, so that's why.\" He understood the joke, accepted the rules of the game and the discussion ended there. This series of circumstances worked in such a way as to make Argentina-England a good match, free from problems or any post-match tensions, even though for one of the two teams, Argentina, who lost, it was a serious blow to their prospects for qualifying. With this testament to the virtues of knowledge and study I don't in any way intend to suggest that without it things are necessarily destined to work out badly but I do think it's a good guideline in life to try to minimise the element of luck involved in doing the best you can.
