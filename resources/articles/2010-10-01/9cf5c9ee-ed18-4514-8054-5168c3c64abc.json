Michael Pritchard, a lance corporal with the Royal Military Police, died in Helmand in December. But his mother did not learn that he had been shot by a British sniper until five months later. Helen Perry said that despite requests for information she had been told little, with the army saying only that Michael may have died in a friendly fire incident. She learned the details of his death only when an army padre told her at a reunion ceremony. At a subsequent briefing from the military police's special investigation branch, it was established that what Mrs Perry describes as a \"catalogue of errors\" had been factors in his death. He had been watched for more than an hour, as he manned an observation tower, before he was shot and killed. Mrs Perry's concerns follow the death of Linda Norgrove, who was a hostage in Afghanistan. Initially, the government said that she had been murdered by the Taliban, though she may have been killed by a US grenade. A US-UK investigation has been opened into her death. An MoD spokesman said: \"Our sympathies remain with the family of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard. Mrs Perry has received a briefing from the Royal Military Police and we remain in contact with her regarding the investigation. It would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
