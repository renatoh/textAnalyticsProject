Fear not. You can still experience what it\u2019s like to be famous for 15 minutes (OK, technically 6mins 59secs) by watching this new video by the gallery, in which the curators take you around the show \u2013 from the immigration forms that document Warhol\u2019s parents arrival in the US to the artworks that grappled with his sexuality and sense of mortality. It may not be a real-life visit, but it is nevertheless a chance to get up-close and personal with Warhol\u2019s work in a whole new way as our guides provide insights on everything from his influence to his silver wigs. \u201cCurating an Andy Warhol exhibition in the present-day means confronting a world where everyone has a mental projection of the artist and his production,\u201d say curators Gregor Muir and Fiont\u00e1n Moran. \u201cEveryone owns Warhol. He is one of those rare artists who transcends the art world, having become widely known as one of America\u2019s most famous artists, if not one of America\u2019s most famous Americans. Over time, Warhol became \u2013 and still is \u2013 a big brand, which is just how he wanted it.\u201d Their aim with the show was to strip away some of the myths about Warhol\u2019s work. \u201cWhen many think of him, they still turn to pop art and images of soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles, Marilyn\u2019s and Jackie\u2019s. Yet most of these works were produced in the early part of the 1960s at the artist\u2019s first home on Lexington Avenue, not the Silver Factory, as people imagine. The reality being that Warhol\u2019s enduring influence can be found in his long-running investment in experimental film and TV, as well as his ongoing fascination with celebrity, business art, pop music and commercial publications.\u201d Warhol was known for shrouding his real identity behind hype and eccentricity. Muir and Moran used this as an opportunity to examine the person beneath all of that. \u201cWe wanted to look at Warhol for who he was, taking into account his family\u2019s journey to America from eastern Europe, his queer identity, and the way in which his work would ultimately be informed by death and religion,\u201d they say. \u201cWith this in mind, we wanted to look at Warhol afresh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
