The Scrooge act was undermined, however, by the Italian\u2019s belief in the miracle of Christmas and the champion pedigree of players he has moulded into the most unlikely, and welcome, of frontrunners. Pre-match talk centred on Leicester\u2019s ability to sustain their remarkable momentum when shorn of key players at tough away venues. It will continue, with Anfield to visit on Boxing Day, despite this season\u2019s first festive trip to Merseyside yielding a convincing, belligerent response and an 11th win in 17 league games. From bottom to top of the table in 12 months, the league leaders continue to embarrass clubs of greater resources, expectations and predications. Two Riyad Mahrez penalties, which took the Algeria international to 13 league goals for the season, and a clinical finish from Shinji Okazaki, recalled by Ranieri because he wanted speed against Everton\u2019s defence, embedded Roberto Mart\u00ednez and his team in that category. \u201cI\u2019ve managed a lot of top teams and in them there were a lot of champions,\u201d said the Leicester manager. \u201cMaybe here there aren\u2019t any champions but there is a team with a great spirit. I enjoy this with them. \u201cAnd I believe also there are good champions inside them. Anybody who watches us knows this. To do what we do for two, three matches, OK, but to do it for five months now, then there are champions also in my team.\u201d Leicester were without Robert Huth, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp at Goodison Park \u2013 and without the ball for much of a contest where Everton maintained their habit of looking good while not winning \u2013 but were resolute, relentless, first to the second ball and, in Okazaki, Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, had the movement and pace to break any back line. The hosts took the game to the league leaders throughout and were offered hope by Romelu Lukaku\u2019s ninth goal in his last eight games, plus Kevin Mirallas\u2019s late finish. With their latest display of pitiful defending, however, a flaw their manager has been unable to rectify, hope amounted to nothing. Ramiro Funes Mori handed Leicester their first penalty by needlessly hauling Okazaki to the ground with the ball running out of play, Howard felled Vardy for the second spot-kick and the Japan forward sealed victory with an instinctive finish from his strike partner\u2019s measured pass. The winner stemmed from an Everton throw-in; a Leicester throw-in produced the opener \u2013 damning evidence of a team who cannot produce the basics. Gerard Deulofeu\u2019s embarrassing petulance and Arouna Kon\u00e9\u2019s ponderous performance were in stark contrast to Leicester\u2019s clinical, disciplined display. \u201cWhen you do this kind of performance a lot of times it is not only because of Vardy or Mahrez,\u201d said Ranieri. \u201cRemember even Maradona alone did nothing. He needed other players around him. Together we are producing as a very good team. It is difficult for the other teams to play against us. \u201cWe are incredibly concentrated, tactically we are at our best and when we get the ball we are very dangerous.\u201d The Italian took charge at Napoli just as Maradona commenced a 15-month ban for testing positive for cocaine. Ranieri may have missed the chance to work with one of the greats but this season will produce no regrets for the 64-year-old regardless of what transpires. He explained: \u201cFor me, no, but for the lads it\u2019s the first time. It\u2019s important they stay calm, clear their minds and focus on another match, and another match. It is the same if we have to be safe or we have to win the title \u2013 it\u2019s still a match and you just have to concentrate on the match. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put them under pressure. Why? Why do we have to be under pressure. Why stress? Last season they had stress, not this year. I think they enjoy this season and they must continue in this way. If we make something special, it\u2019s a miracle. If it doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s a miracle all the same! What we are doing is a miracle, so enjoy and play.\u201d Man of the match Wes Morgan (Leicester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
