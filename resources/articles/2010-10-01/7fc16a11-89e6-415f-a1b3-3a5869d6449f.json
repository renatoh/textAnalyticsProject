The first stage of an epic journey for 33 Chilean miners trapped 700 metres underground since 5 August was complete. A rescue tunnel snaking deep into the mountain finally reached them and, as the drill bit sliced through the rock, the men below celebrated with songs and cheers, before sending messages that no one had been injured. The crude tunnel into the San Jos\u00e9 copper and gold mine will now be used to haul out the miners one by one in a rescue capsule. President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said he hoped the men would be rescued next week. \"If it's Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it doesn't matter. What matters is to rescue them alive and rescue them safely. And for that we'll spare no effort.\" However, there may be delays if the tunnel, which will be minutely inspected by cameras, needs lining with metal tubing to help slip the escape capsules through. Within seconds of the drill reaching the miners, a chorus of truck horns echoed through the valley, sending a long-awaited signal to family members who had spent the past months in a vigil of hope and anxiety. Hundreds of anxious relatives hugged, cried and climbed the mountainside to celebrate. On the hillside, surrounded by 33 flags \u2013 one for each of the trapped men \u2013 the relatives cheered. \"It is almost over, they are about to get out,\" said Roberto Reyes, 45, a miner whose uncle Mario G\u00f3mez is trapped. G\u00f3mez, 63, is the oldest of the 33 trapped miners and has been a spiritual leader for the men, leading them in prayer and building an altar deep inside the collapsed mine. \"I am sending him tranquillity and comfort, the worst is over,\" said Alonso Gallardo, 34, another nephew of G\u00f3mez. \"He can confront this, he already survived the accident,\" said Reyes, in reference to a mining accident years ago that severed G\u00f3mez's fingers and mutilated his hands. Laurence Golborne, Chile's mining minister, said the tricky operation to bring the men out will probably begin on Wednesday. \"This is an important achievement, but we still haven't rescued anybody,\" he cautioned. \"This rescue won't be over until the last person below leaves this mine.\" Even as he spoke, family members gathered around the embers of campfires, ate breakfast with a smile and shared coffee and hugs with strangers. Hundreds of foreign journalists rushed about, sending news to the world that \"los 33\" had been moved one step closer to freedom. Jeff Hart, 40, a rangy oil worker from Denver, Colorado, who operated the drilling rig, became an instant celebrity. As he wandered through the tent city, he was surrounded by members of the miners' families offering hugs. \"You wouldn't understand it if you don't work in drilling,\" said Hart, as he described the delicate touch he used to dip the drill bit into the mine shaft without getting it stuck. \"It is a vibration that you feel in your feet that tells you what the drill is doing.\" He described the final minutes of the drilling operation as a joint effort, with the underground miners feeding live video footage to the rescuers. Asked what he would tell the miners, Hart laughed and said: \"Two days ago we sent them a message, 'We'll be there'. Now I would say, 'Follow us'.\" As horns blared, clowns, brought in to entertain the children, walked through the camp and the families prepared for a weekend of euphoric celebration. \"We are going to have a huge party in the neighbourhood,\" said Daniel Sanderson, 27, who slept just one hour during the night as he awaited the fate of his two best friends, who are trapped. Sanderson, who also worked in the San Jos\u00e9 mine, said that, despite the dangers and the extreme experience of being trapped for many weeks deep underground, his friends would continue to work as miners. \"They already wrote me they are going to look for new mining jobs. We are all miners.\" As the hours passed, the scene at Camp Hope became festive as food donations poured in, miners in hard-hats went from tent to tent hugging family members and hundreds of journalists described a story for which the world has had an insatiable appetite. \"These are for everyone,\" said Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, 39, as he unloaded 40 crates of fresh avocados at his family's tent in Camp Hope. \"I just want to hug them,\" he said, in reference to Ren\u00e1n and Florencio Avalos, his two brothers who are both trapped. \"I would tell them to stay calm. We are all waiting here.\" The miners below must now use explosives to enlarge the passage to make room for the capsule that will winch them, one by one, to safety. A remaining fear is that the rockfall that originally trapped them may have weakened the props holding up the mine. The first people down the shaft will be a rescue expert from a state-owned mining conglomerate and a medical expert, who will prepare the men for their journey to the surface. Some of the fittest will go first, in case the capsule encounters problems during its ascent. There is already speculation as to which miner might be the first to emerge into the daylight. Among the fittest is Edison Pe\u00f1a, an Elvis Presley fan and athlete who has been keeping fit below ground. The weakest will go next, and the group's leaders last. It will take roughly an hour to extract each man. They will be taken to a field hospital built near the entrance to the shaft where, if they are strong enough, they will be allowed to meet three relatives each. They will then be flown by helicopter to a hospital in the nearest city, Copiap\u00f3, for more thorough checks and at least two days of recuperation. And then it is expected that the moguls from Hollywood will make their appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
