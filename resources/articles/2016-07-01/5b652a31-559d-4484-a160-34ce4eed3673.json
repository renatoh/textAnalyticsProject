Regarding the road race, Froome said: \u201cIt\u2019s more of a gamble, being a one-day race and having such small teams, only five per nation. It\u2019s going to be an extremely hard race to judge tactically, you can\u2019t just put eight guys on the front and hold it back for the last climb and make it as selective as possible. With the looks of the team that we\u2019ve got, the inclusion of Steve Cummings, we can be competitive, and to have a result there would be phenomenal.\u201d When it comes to the time trial, where he won the bronze medal in 2012, Froome said that he has \u201cbeen thinking about it for six months\u201d. He added that \u201cthe course suits me well, it has 1,000 metres of climbing, and is 60 kilometres\u201d, which is relatively long for a time trial. He intends to ride next weekend\u2019s Ride London Classic one-day race \u2013 giving British fans a rare opportunity to see him racing on home roads \u2013 and will then fly to Rio a week out in order to look over the course for the road race and time trial. Froome said that having raced in a radically different way in the past few weeks in the Tour de France, the experience of attacking in different situations could prove valuable in a one-day race such as the Games. \u201cCertainly. I definitely feel I\u2019ve matured a lot as a bike rider over the last couple of seasons,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the age of 31 I definitely feel I\u2019m learning more and more. I did come into the sport very late. Tactically I\u2019ve shown that this year I\u2019ve matured, that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve been able to race the way I have.\u201d The three-times Tour winner added that he feels during and after this year\u2019s race he has now answered those critics who described his racing style as robotic or boring, and that his attacking has shown that while Team Sky might have the biggest budget and the strongest team, \u201cit\u2019s not just about who you have on the roster, but about how you race\u201d. Froome revisited the most dramatic moment of the race, when he broke his bike after crashing into a television motorbike just over a kilometre before the Mont Ventoux stage finish, and felt he had no other option but to take to his feet and run up the mountain until he found another bike. \u201cIf anything it shows my will to win. How badly I want it,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning two Tours didn\u2019t make me complacent, didn\u2019t make me want it less. This one could be the first one all over again. I was going to fight just as hard. \u201cIt was chaos. I got up, your natural instinct is to get back on your bike but I could see it was in bits. I didn\u2019t even give it a second thought. I\u2019m just over a kilometre from the finish, I\u2019ve got to get closer to that finish line however I can, and that\u2019s running. I was aware of people around me, there were people shouting. At that point I wanted to get closer to the finish line but I wanted to get away from that bottle-necked area.\u201d Froome said the stage that had meant the most to him was not the one into Montpellier, when he broke away with Peter Sagan, but the downhill victory into Luchon where he flew down the descent in a tuck position reminiscent of Graeme Obree. \u201cThat epitomised what bike racing is all about,\u201d the Tour winner reflected. \u201cI felt like a kid again, trying to be the fastest down the hill with all my mates behind me. That\u2019s what racing is about, that thrill, the adrenaline, the boy-racer mentality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
