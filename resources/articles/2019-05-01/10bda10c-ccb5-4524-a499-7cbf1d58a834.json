Top stories Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgenocidal taunts\u201d after a strongly worded warning from Trump that Tehran should not think of attacking the US. Zarif said Trump hoped to achieve \u201cwhat Alexander, Genghis &amp; other aggressors failed to do\u201d. On Sunday Trump warned Iran not to threaten the US or else it would face its \u201cofficial end\u201d. Meanwhile, the US president has sought to discredit a New York Times report on Deutsche Bank transactions involving legal entities controlled by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law. Trump said he did not \u201cneed or want banks\u201d and did not receive money from Russia. Labor will need to reassess its entire policy agenda, including its ambitious 45% emissions reduction target, a leadership aspirant, Jim Chalmers, has warned. \u201cEverything is up for grabs\u201d in the wake of the election defeat, Chalmers told the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A last night, adding: \u201cObviously the vote was disappointingly weak.\u201d Some Liberals are also urging a reassessment of their party\u2019s energy policy. Arthur Sinodinos has warned that the party should not stand in the way of renewables, suggesting that the government should use a changing energy market to bolster its environmental credentials. Anticipating a fresh internal battle over energy policy, the Liberal senator suggested the government should recast itself as the best manager of the grid and \u201ctake advantage\u201d of renewables\u2019 falling cost. Rex Patrick, a key figure in the emerging Senate crossbench, has warned his party will not support the Coalition\u2019s proposed anti-corruption body unless it is given stronger powers. The makeup of the Senate is still being finalised, but the two Centre Alliance senators appear likely to play a critical role. Patrick told Guardian Australia the Coalition\u2019s flagship integrity proposal \u2013 a national integrity commission \u2013 \u201cjust doesn\u2019t cut it\u201d. He said: \u201cWe need to have a commission which has broad jurisdiction and coercive powers to deal with allegations of corruption in the federal domain. Anything less will be viewed by the public as inadequate.\u201d World The expected demise of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan has sparked open lobbying over an alternative Tory vision. Attention in the UK is shifting rapidly to what happens when the prime minister leaves No 10, as she has promised to do within weeks. The US ban on sharing technology with Huawei was a \u201ccynically timed\u201d blow in the escalating trade war between the US and China, the Chinese firm\u2019s top executive in the UK has said. The US government says a 16-year-old Guatemalan died on Monday at a border patrol station in south Texas, the fifth death of a migrant child since December. Austria\u2019s far-right interior minister, Herbert Kickl, has been fired in the wake of the \u201cIbiza\u201d corruption scandal that has engulfed the Freedom party, leading to the complete collapse of the country\u2019s governing coalition. A 23-year-old transgender woman who was seen on a widely circulated video being beaten in front of a crowd of people has been found shot dead in Dallas, Texas. Muhlaysia Booker was found face-down in a street early on Saturday and pronounced dead at the scene. Opinion and analysis The election result offers Labor a brutal lesson about forging genuine connections with local communities, writes Anne Davies. \u201cThe pattern is repeated over and over. The Liberals pick people with deep roots in the community, or who have life experiences that voters in that electorate will relate to. Labor picks candidates who have served the party either as staffers or with unions, or who have a lifelong Labor pedigree \u2026 Most of these people are talented and committed but the preselection processes of Labor limit the gene pool and potential candidates from outside the Labor family who have wider life experiences are locked out.\u201d \u201cBoris Johnson is heading for No 10 and there is nothing dishonest, disreputable or even scandalous enough that he can do to stop his party choosing him now,\u201d writes Polly Toynbee. \u201cThey know of his lies, laziness and narcissism, but they don\u2019t care. After a crushing humiliation at the polls in Thursday\u2019s EU election, where the Tory vote may fall to single figures, this drowning party will clutch for the straw-headed showman to save them from triumphant Faragists. Well, Prime Minister Johnson would provide a fitting finale to this ever-darkening decade.\u201d Sport Did you hear that sound at the weekend? A deep, cleansing sigh of relief? It was Lisa Alexander. The Diamonds coach \u2013 who will meet fellow selectors this week to pick Australia\u2019s Netball World Cup team \u2013 would have been delighted to see her captain, Caitlin Bassett, finally hit her straps as she helped the Giants beat the Queensland Firebirds. Rejuvenated under their new coach, Justin Langer, reigning World Cup champions Australia suddenly look like real contenders for the upcoming tournament in the UK, but must find a way to integrate Steve Smith and David Warner back into a winning side. Thinking time: Acute Misfortune The writer Erik Jensen and the film-maker Thomas M Wright fought \u201ctooth and nail\u201d when collaborating on Acute Misfortune, the adaptation of Jensen\u2019s \u201cunfilmable\u201d biography of the artist Adam Cullen. Wright describes Cullen, who won an Archibald prize in 2000 for his portrait of David Wenham, as an \u201castonishing\u201d artist whose early work contained \u201celectric insights into the undercurrents of Australian culture\u201d. But Wright\u2019s hauntingly poetic film is far from an idealised portrait, rejecting the idea that the greatness of the artist excuses the sins of the person. Cullen\u2019s behaviour was manipulative and his lifestyle dangerous. He was constantly on drugs and fraternised with suspect characters including Mark \u201cChopper\u201d Read, with whom he shared a close friendship (in fact, Wright says, Cullen was best man at Read\u2019s wedding). He also had an obsession with guns: one time Cullen accidentally shot Jensen in the leg, and on another he was arrested for illegal possession of weapons. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph calls Scott Morrison the \u201c$33 billion man\u201d in its headline, and the Australian refers to \u201cScoMo Mojo\u201d, in stories about the stock market surge sparked by Morrison\u2019s victory. The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that key Senate crossbenchers have warned the Coalition it has no \u201cmandate for its tax changes\u201d, as the ABC reports the proposed cut is likely to be delayed another year. The Australian Financial Review takes readers inside the campaign team that lost it for Labor. Coming up Counting of postal votes will begin in all 151 lower house seats but the focus will be on the particularly close contests in Bass, Chisholm and Macquarie. The royal commission into police use of informers continues in Melbourne, looking at Nicola Gobbo\u2019s involvement with police in 2003 and 2004.
