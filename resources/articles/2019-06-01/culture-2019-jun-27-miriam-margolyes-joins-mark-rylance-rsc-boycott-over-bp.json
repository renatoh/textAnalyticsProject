Rylance told the Guardian last week that BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d and said he did not wish to be associated with BP any more than with \u201can arms dealer or a tobacco salesman\u201d. Now Margolyes has said she would also refuse to appear in any RSC productions while the company retained its sponsorship deal with the oil company. \u201cMark Rylance is absolutely right in his stance and I support it,\u201d she told the BBC on Wednesday. \u201cI would turn them down as long as they are supporting something that is doing harm to the world.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started the global school climate strikes movement, has also come out in favour of Rylance\u2019s stance, writing on Twitter: On Wednesday another British actor, Maureen Lipman, said Rylance was \u201cjolly silly\u201d for his stance and said he should go into politics rather than take a stand as an actor. \u201cMethinks the gentleman doth protest too much,\u201d she wrote in a letter to the Times. \u201cI feel Mark could find himself a rotten borough or two to put his mouth where his petroleum coupons are.\u201d BP sponsors subsidised \u00a35 tickets for young people at the RSC as part of a five-year sponsorship deal worth \u00a37.5m that BP signed with the company and three other institutions \u2013 the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery \u2013 in 2016. The company says its funding has allowed huge numbers of young people to enjoy the arts and says it is committed to working with governments and businesses to tackle the climate crisis. However, the pressure is growing on arts institutions to sever their links with the company and other fossil fuel firms. In recent weeks there have been a series of high-profile protests by artists and campaigners at UK cultural institutions. There has also been a spate of large donations by celebrities to environmental protest groups. David Gilmour, the Pink Floyd frontman, donated $21m (\u00a317m) from auctioning his guitars to Client Earth, an environmental law group, and Radiohead said proceeds from the release of a vast collection of unreleased tracks would go to Extinction Rebellion. Jess Worth, from the campaign group Culture Unstained, said it was part of a growing awareness of the climate crisis among actors, singers and artists. \u201cThe arts have woken up to the climate crisis and we are increasingly seeing artists and musicians putting their principles into action. It is time our leading museums and galleries got on the right side of history and stopped normalising an industry that is accelerating climate breakdown while we still have a small window to turn things around.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
