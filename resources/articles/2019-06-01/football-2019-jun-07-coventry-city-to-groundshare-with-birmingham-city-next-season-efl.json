The rugby club said that negotiations had broken down because Sisu would not commit to a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d, to bring no further proceedings about the ownership of the arena, after years of court actions that Sisu have launched and lost. Wasps and the football club said in statements that Sisu had given such an undertaking at the beginning of talks in April to extend Coventry\u2019s tenure at the Ricoh. However, it was then revealed by the BBC that before the talks started, Sisu had in February made a complaint to the European Commission about Coventry city council\u2019s 2014 sale of the Ricoh to Wasps. The rugby club said in its statement that Sisu had not informed them that the complaint had been made but nevertheless continued with the talks. \u201cDespite significant progress being made in the discussions,\u201d Wasps said, \u201cwe have unfortunately been unable to reach an agreement with the owners which, putting aside the complaint to the European Commission, would deliver the fundamental principle that there would be no further proceedings about the ownership of the Ricoh Arena.\u201d In its statement, Sisu said that it had given an \u201cirrevocable undertaking\u201d before the talks to \u201ccease all proceedings against Wasps\u201d, but that it would not agree to Wasps\u2019 requirement to halt all proceedings because: \u201cThat would unreasonably restrict the club and Sisu\u2019s basic legal rights and would commit the club and Sisu to underwrite Wasps\u2019 costs and any future damages.\u201d In May Coventry revealed a provisional groundshare at an unnamed venue had been arranged but that the League One club\u2019s intention was to stay put. However, they will now play matches 18 miles away at St Andrew\u2019s. \u201cThe club has delayed any stadium announcement in the hope that a deal could be agreed with Wasps to play at the Ricoh Arena. The deadline has passed and unfortunately there has been no agreement,\u201d Coventry said in a statement. \u201cTo ensure we fulfil our home fixtures and therefore retain our place in the EFL, CCFC will be groundsharing next season. We know full well this is a very sad day for Coventry City, the City of Coventry, Coventrians and most importantly Sky Blues supporters.\u201d The most recent court case that Sisu lost was a claim that Coventry city council, which built the Ricoh Arena in 2005 for the football club, undervalued it by \u00a327m when they sold the stadium to Wasps in 2014. If Sisu were to win such a claim, Wasps could have to pay that amount, above the \u00a321m it did pay. In April the supreme court refused Sisu leave to appeal against the judgment, which found that the council valued the stadium properly. It then emerged that Sisu had made its complaint to the European Commission. Wasps have repeatedly emphasised their willingness to agree a tenancy deal for Coventry to stay at the Ricoh, but said: \u201cWe made it a pre-requisite of talks that the owners would stop pursuing proceedings around the ownership of the Ricoh Arena.\u201d The council\u2019s sale of the Ricoh to Wasps followed Sisu withholding rent in 2013, which a High Court judge, Mr Justice Hickinbottom, found was an effort to financially distress the arena operating company, jointly owned by the council and a local charity, so that Sisu could buy it \u201cat a knockdown price\u201d. The move to St Andrew\u2019s will be the second time Sisu have moved the football club away from the Ricoh; in 2013 they went to Northampton Town, which caused the arena operating company more financial difficulties. The matches were widely boycotted by supporters, and the EFL had been hoping that Sisu would agree a deal at the Ricoh and not move the club again, stressing that the league\u2019s rules require a club if possible to play in the place whose name it bears. In a statement the EFL said: \u201cThis situation has placed the EFL in an unenviable position and as a result it has reluctantly agreed to a groundshare option at Birmingham City for 2019-20. This is a decision that has not been taken lightly and it is regrettable that the parties involved have been unable to find a suitable and sensible solution. The EFL board calls on all parties to resolve this matter at the earliest convenience for the benefit of the city, the club and people living in the local community.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
