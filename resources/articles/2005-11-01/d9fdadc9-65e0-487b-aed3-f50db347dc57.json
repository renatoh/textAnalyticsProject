The leading developing countries said the mid-December deadline for an outline deal to liberalise trade was too soon and that there might have to be a delay or a scaling-back of ambition for the round launched in Doha, Qatar, four years ago. For the first time, Brazil suggested ministers would make little progress next month. \"We may need a Hong Kong II,\" the trade minister, Celso Amorim, said. Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner, said he was still pressing for a wide-ranging agreement when all the WTO's 148 members meet in Hong Kong between December 13 and 18. \"The moment you start reducing expectations, you risk introducing complacency,\" Mr Mandelson said, as about 20 WTO participants started two days of talks in Geneva. \"We should keep up the pressure to narrow the differences.\" Trade campaigners also expressed concern at the downbeat statements from Brazil and India following five-party talks in London that also included the United States, the European Union and Japan. With developing countries seeking further concessions from the west in agriculture, and Washington and Brussels demanding better market access for their manufacturing and service-sector firms, the London talks ended without agreement. C\u00e9line Charveriat, head of Oxfam International's Make Trade Fair campaign, said: \"Now is not the time to scale down ambition. The world's poor need a deal in Hong Kong ... Every day of delay is another day of suffering for millions. \"The talks are not on track but it is not too late to rescue them. All players need to focus on what was promised four years ago: reform of world trade rules that boosts development. To shift the goalposts now and say the meeting in Hong Kong doesn't matter is unacceptable,\" said Ms Charveriat. Pascal Lamy, the WTO director general, hopes intensive talks this week will break the deadlock in the talks, with compromises from all players leading to a draft declaration for Hong Kong being tabled within the next fortnight. He warned WTO members that there was \"no Plan B\" if the Hong Kong meeting repeated the failures of Seattle in 1999 and Cancun in 2003, and that the costs of a \"non-round\" could be hundreds of billions of pounds. Both Mr Mandelson and Rob Portman, the US trade envoy, said after the London talks that they were pleased the meeting had not focused exclusively on agriculture. \"It was a constructive discussion. This is all about working towards a consensus. It's not easy,\" said Mr Portman. India wants the main emphasis to be on agriculture - its major trade sector - and on providing poor nations with the help they need to build their economies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
