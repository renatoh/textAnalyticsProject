They are following a money trail from a flat in Hammersmith, west London, which Hamza sold for a profit of about \u00a3130,000 in September 2004, to the house in Greenford, west London, which was bought in October 2004 while he was in custody awaiting trial for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred. At the time Hamza's assets were frozen by the Treasury under anti-terrorism measures. Hamza, who is serving a seven-year prison term, claimed hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal aid for his terrorism case which has yet to be paid. The Legal Services Commission has launched an investigation into his assets in an attempt to claw back some or all of the bill as part of its remit to cut the country's \u00a32bn legal aid budget. The former preacher at Finsbury Park mosque in north London is believed to have bought the four-bedroom house despite some of his assets being frozen by the Treasury in April 2002. As the inquiry into the transaction continues, a judge has issued an order preventing the sale of the house without permission of the court. The order, dated June 29 2006, names three people, including Hamza's second wife and two people thought to be relatives. One, Ola Kamel Mostafa, is named as the owner of the Greenford property on Land Registry documents. The property has been advertised for rent at \u00a3270 a week with an estate agent in Shepherd's Bush and also on the internet, and until recently was home to a large group of Polish tenants. David Keegan, director of the Legal Services Commission's special investigations unit, said the commission was attempting to force Hamza to pay for his legal aid bill under what is known as a recovery for defence costs order. \"The investigation into Abu Hamza's assets by the LSC's special investigation unit to support the granting of the ... order continues,\" he said. Mr Justice Hughes, who issued the order preventing the sale of the house in Greenford, has ordered the cleric to disclose what interest he had in the property in Adie Road, Hammersmith, which he sold in September 2004 and give details of his bank accounts. Hamza was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey in February after being convicted of soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred. He appeared by video link at City of Westminster magistrates' court from Belmarsh prison yesterday when an attempt to extradite him to the US was put back for a month. The US government is seeking his \"temporary surrender\" under the 2003 Extradition Act which would allow him to be tried there, for charges including providing support to al-Qaida and involvement in a hostage conspiracy in Yemen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
