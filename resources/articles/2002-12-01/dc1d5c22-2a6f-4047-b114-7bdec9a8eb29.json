Alinghi led around all marks in the six-leg Louis Vuitton Cup race in the Hauraki Gulf, off the New Zealand coast, to beat the US software billionaire Larry Ellison's Oracle-BMW Racing team by 71 seconds . OneWorld beat Prada by 47 seconds, a win that puts the Seattle-based team level in the series after the one-point penalty imposed by the cup arbitration panel on Monday in all future rounds for not declaring boat design secrets taken from other teams. The OneWorld crewman Andrew Taylor said the penalty had motivated them. \"We're all professionals, so it's just a matter of us coming down to the nitty-gritty of the competition,\" he said. The lead exchanged hands several times but Prada went past its rival after the second mark. When the Italian boat turned to protect her wind, the spinnaker boom shattered and OneWorld surged ahead, as Prada's sail dropped on to the deck. OneWorld's spinnaker exploded as it was hoisted but the crew soon had a replacement sail up. Russell Coutts at the wheel of Alinghi, dominated his fellow New Zealander Chris Dickson in the other semi-final to finish more than a minute ahead. The winners of the Alinghi-Oracle series face the holders of the America's Cup, Team New Zealand, in February. The losers sail off against the winners of the Prada-OneWorld semi-final in a repechage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
