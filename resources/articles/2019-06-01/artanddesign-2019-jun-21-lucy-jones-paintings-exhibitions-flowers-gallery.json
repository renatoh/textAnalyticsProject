Now 64, Jones was born with cerebral palsy, a lifelong condition affecting movement and coordination. For most of her career, she hasn\u2019t wanted to talk about her disabilities. \u201cI am still not terribly happy with people putting me into a strange box of \u2018disability\u2019, quite often it seems invasive.\u201d In her art, however, she has never avoided the subject \u2013 and she has never been more confident of who she is than in her latest paintings, currently on show at Flowers Gallery, London, and soon at a big new retrospective in Leicester, exploring three decades of prolific work. In a new series of self-portraits, Jones paints herself as never before \u2013 full bodied, in lucid lines and celebratory colour. It\u2019s a new phase for the artist who not only has cerebral palsy but severe dyslexia and experience of depression, too. When out with her \u201cwheelie\u201d \u2013 as she fondly refers to the frame she uses to help her walk \u2013 Jones is used to being stared at. Her paintings allow her to reverse the gaze and stare back, putting us in her shoes. For Jones, disability is something the rest of the world needs to learn to deal with, rather than something she should be expected to explain. Paintings are a form of protection. Though the cerebral palsy affects her body and makes painting an immense physical effort, Jones\u2019s greatest challenges have come as a result of dyslexia. She was only diagnosed in her 30s. In a painting completed this year, Just Looking, Just Checking on You, Jones challenges the viewer to decipher words reflected in a mirror; not unlike what she goes through when she reads. \u201cWatching You Looking at Me,\u201d the text shouts at you, once decoded. Jones admits that it is deliberately \u201cquite aggressive \u2026 In my self-portraits I reflect back other people\u2019s projections.\u201d Art gave Jones the opportunity to think, without the prison of words. An early aptitude for creativity lead her to study at Byam Shaw (now Central St Martins), then at Camberwell School of Art \u2013 where she earned a first \u2013 and then at the Royal College of Art. When she finished her masters there in 1982, she won a scholarship for painting at the prestigious British School of Rome. Though she thrived academically, when Jones returned to London in 1984, she struggled to have her work accepted by any commercial gallery. \u201cThey were probably thinking, \u2018oh go away, you wobbly lady\u2019!\u201d Jones quips with a wit that often finds its way into the titles of her paintings; a coping mechanism, but also one of the compelling aspects of her work. In 1985, aged 30, and following a particularly difficult year, a turning point for Jones came when she was picked up by art dealer Angela Flowers. She has been with the gallery ever since. In May, the new works she will present prove just how far she has come in three decades: unflinching self-portraits and jubilant landscapes, easily as good as any Hockney. She used to paint London\u2019s bridges, but since relocating to Shropshire 15 years ago, she has been inspired by her garden and the countryside. Painting landscapes are a physical feat for Jones: she kneels on the ground to do sketching, and back at her studio, a converted barn, a trolley supports her as she moves to paint over her canvases. Her balance is fragile \u2013 she paints on the floor, on her hands and knees \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s less far to fall!\u201d This close physical contact with the earth give Jones\u2019 landscape paintings a perspective that is completely unique; her paintings allow her to explore the world in another way. \u201cThe landscape gives me a freedom of mind, air and space, exactly opposite to painting myself or portraits. I need to be outside to live, to think and just be.\u201d Painting has made Jones visible \u2013 to paint herself back into the world. It has also had a transformative effect on her life. \u201cMy relationship with myself has changed over the years, especially with my self-portraits, which used to be more about the depressive outlook I had on life. I have moved through many phases of engagement with the world. Now my work is moving more towards commenting on how people might look at me or someone else I paint.\u201d At her exhibitions, Jones will reveal her recent paintings of other people \u2013 her first subjects are the men who have played an influential role in her personal and professional life. They have never been seen before. There\u2019s an imposing portrait of her late father; a tender view of her husband, Peter; her close friend, the social scientist Tom Shakespeare, her gallerist Matthew Flowers \u2013 and a vulnerable-looking Grayson Perry, gripping a mug of tea. The Perry portrait is titled The Seeing Orator \u2013 another dash of Jones\u2019s incisive irony. It\u2019s hard to think of any contemporary artist working in the UK now who has overcome as much adversity as Jones. So why hasn\u2019t she received more attention? \u201cI think people are quite nervous about dealing with somebody like me,\u201d she suggests. Diversity might be firmly on the cultural agenda, but there is still a long way to go. Yet to overlook her humane and timeless work would be foolish: she is an empathetic observer of the human condition, and of human vulnerability \u2013 the things that make every one of us a bit \u201cwobbly\u201d. Lucy Jones, Landscape and Inscape, New Work is at Flowers Gallery, London, until 6 July. Lucy Jones: Awkward Beauty is at Attenborough Arts Centre, Leicester, 27 July to 6 October. The artist\u2019s book, Awkward Beauty, is published by Elephant in association with Flowers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
