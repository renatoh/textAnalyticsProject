First and foremost a poet, he won the T S Eliot Prize for First Language ; in recent years he has also undertaken a series of improvisations in prose, ornamenting and rephrasing some of the traditional genres. Shamrock Tea is perhaps his most potent blend to date. It will certainly give booksellers a headache, since it claims to be a novel but might equally be filed under History, Philosophy, Art or Myth and Religion. Carson's imaginary brew is said to contain shamrocks, aconite, belladonna and coltsfoot, and during the course of the novel Wittgenstein, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Arthur Conan Doyle all get to take a sip (it can also be smoked). Whatever is in it, it allows you to see the world straight. The plot is merely pot-warming, but for what it's worth: Carson the narrator and his cousin Berenice are growing up in Belfast in the late 1950s when they stumble upon Uncle Celestine's secret stash of shamrock tea; they smoke it and duly find themselves floating into the world of Jan van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait . Mind-boggling adventures in time and space follow, featuring walk-on and speaking parts for various tea-fuelled philosophers, saints and writers. Carson's prose slips down as easily as a prairie oyster: you'll either love it or it'll give you stomach contractions. Regular drinkers will already be familiar with his aromatic blend of fact, runes, analogy and psychogeography, but for those still seeking a taste, try this: \"On May 19, 1897, Wilde was released from imprisonment; it was the feast of Pope Celestine V, patron saint of bookbinders, for whom I, Celestine Carson, am named. On 8 February 1898, Wilde published The Ballad of Reading Gaol , a bitter denunciation of the prison system. It was the 44th birthday of Edward Carson, and the feast of St Apollonia, patron of those suffering from toothache; Wilde's teeth, after two years of a prison diet, were notoriously bad.\" Such excursions do have a purpose. At the end of the novel, the fictional Carson goes back into the past to recover a supply of shamrock tea to infiltrate the water supply of Belfast and lead the inhabitants to realise that the Many are One and the One Many, and that in the end \"there will be no division\". Even stone-cold sober, it's not too difficult to read between the lines here. For the sake of the peace process it's a shame that shamrock tea doesn't actually exist, although it's rumoured that even unionists drink Guinness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
