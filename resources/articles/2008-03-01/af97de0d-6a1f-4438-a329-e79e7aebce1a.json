Judy Kay Zagorski, of Pigeon, Michigan, was sitting in a boat going 25 mph (40 kph) when the spotted eagle ray, with a wingspan of 5 feet to 6 feet (1.5 meters to 1.8 meters), leapt out of the water, said Jorge Pino, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The 57-year-old woman's father was driving the boat on the Atlantic Ocean side of Vaca Key, Pino said. \"He had absolutely no warning. It just happened instantaneously,\" Pino said. The impact probably killed the woman, but it was not immediately clear if she had any puncture wounds from the ray's barb, Pino said. An autopsy will determine an official cause of death, he added. Spotted eagle rays can weigh up to 500 pounds (227 kilograms) and have a wingspan of up to 10 feet (3 meters). They are known to occasionally jump out of the water but are not aggressive and use the venomous barb at the end of their tail as a defence mechanism. The rays are protected in Florida waters and are typically seen swimming on the water's surface. \"Rays jump to escape a predator, give birth and shake off parasites,\" said Lynn Gear, supervisor of fishes and reptiles at Theater of the Sea in Islamorada. \"They do not attack people.\" Steve Irwin, the Australian television presenter known as the Crocodile Hunter, was killed by a stingray in 2006 in a freak accident while diving off the north Queensland coast. In the wake of his death up to 10 apparently mutilated stingrays washed up in coastal waters, prompting Queensland state officials to call on fans of the self-styled \"wildlife warrior Australian bloke\" not to retaliate against the species that killed their hero."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
