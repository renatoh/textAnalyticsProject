When Oona King was first elected, a woman MP getting up to speak in the house was greeted with cries of \"Melons\". At the Tricycle, such observations are not so much reported as incarnated. It's one of the gifts of Nicolas Kent's theatre to take a debate or event and put flesh on it. Last year's cycle of plays about Afghanistan returns next month; now, under the impressive directorship of Indhu Rubasingham, nine plays by women playwrights \u2013 interwoven with verbatim accounts from MPs, assembled by Gillian Slovo \u2013 treat the subject of women, power and politics. Stella Gonet's Shirley Williams is furrowed and candid; Kika Markham's Ann Widdecombe is dogged and exact. The speech of these women has little in common, but you see here how similar is their physical stance: both stand with their legs rather apart, flatties firmly planted, as if the ground might begin to rock beneath them. It's pell-mell saturation, some five hours' worth of drama divided into two sections: \"'Then\" is (sometimes very) pre-Thatcher; \"Now\" is post-Blair. No solutions are offered but a myriad questions are flung out. Rebecca Lenkiewicz contributes a play about Elizabeth I, concentrating on her piece of ruff trade, Essex: it's a fairly familiar look at isolation, but affords a blazing opportunity for Niamh Cusack, at her most gleaming. Moira Buffini's Handbagged sees Elizabeth II, in the shape of a subtly mischievous, kitten-eyed Kika Markham, preparing to meet Mrs Thatcher: \"If she's got a dog, we've got a subject.\" Markham and Gonet, who captures the caressing swoops of Thatcher's voice with eerie exactness, make a sharpish script (each woman has a doppelganger; both are tethered to identical dangling handbags) the comic high point of the evening. They keep on coming, these women and wimmin. Marie Jones's play creates a suffragette milliner who plots the burning of banks while she arranges peacock feathers. Joy Wilkinson's Acting Leader presents a baleful Margaret Beckett, almost forgotten as a contender for the Labour party leadership, though reputed to be one of the hardest interviewees to crack. She didn't appear in Peter Morgan's The Deal (\"Perhaps they couldn't find an actress to play me. They tend to be attractive, actresses\"). Elsewhere, there's a weaver and a porn producer and a 14-year-old would-be mother. When (apart from the recent all-naked extravaganza at the Barbican) were so many people without penises last together on the London stage? Zinnie Harris's outstanding The Panel features a table of undiluted men flailing around as they debate the shortcomings of a series of women candidates. It's not rare to see an all-male power play on stage, or witness it in life, but suddenly the configuration looks abnormal. A re-education of the audience's eye takes place in the course of the evening: this is the big success of Rubasingham's epic. The effect of Women, Power and Politics is cumulative: it can withstand some troughs, just as one long play can survive dips. Bola Agbaje's satire on girl power is over-extended, as is Sue Townsend's look at life on a sink estate. But Lucy Kirkwood's Bloody Wimmin shows how much a short work can contain. It evokes protest at Greenham Common (babies in potato-sack papooses), protest at home (an upsettingly convincing row) and chic protest at a climate-change camp. It combines irony with conviction. And it contains the three big lights of the evening: Cusack, Gonet and Markham. What more could a girl ask? Ingmar Bergman agreed to a stage adaptation of only one of his films: Through a Glass Darkly. That may have been a mistake. The swirling chiaroscuro of the 1961 movie, in which a young woman mentally unravels in front of a surging sea, becomes in Michael Attenborough's production a staccato, over-explicit affair. The plot now looks like a prisoner of its time. It's not hard to make out the influence of Bergman's hero, Strindberg, in this small-scale, bleak piece, and Tom Scutt's design catches something of Strindberg's seascapes, with a marine and glowering palette. As so often in British productions of Scandinavian drama, scabrousness begins to look like tasteful distress. Still, the main affinity is with the wilder theories of RD Laing. Here is the family as a constraining force: a dominant father, a touch of sibling incest, a husband with syringes at the ready. Here, too, is the queasy notion of breakdown as a kind of breakthrough. Jenny Worton's adaptation makes evident what would be better suggested: \"I am looking into the abyss,\" announces the heroine, as she slips out of sanity. It pops too many clich\u00e9s into the mouths of her characters; at one point, one of them solemnly intones \"I want you to know I'm here for you.\" It's an over-emphasis compounded by Dan Jones's soundscape, which is imaginative in conception (a combination of music and natural sounds) but heavy in execution, underscoring points of tension with shivers of sound, and pelting in with unnecessary rain. Still, there is a magnet in Through a Glass Darkly. Ruth Wilson has a particularly fascinating combination of velvet voice and challenging glare: in her dodgy role in BBC1's Luther she made the word \"accomplice\" sound like a sex aid. Here she projects Karin's mental torment through an extraordinary physical volatility. As she fights against the collapse of her sanity, she struggles like an insect stuck together with superglue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
