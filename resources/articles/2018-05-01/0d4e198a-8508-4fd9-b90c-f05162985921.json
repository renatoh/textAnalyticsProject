It was one of the many moments that have confounded the North Korean refugee since his recent arrival in the South.Shopping, using a cash machine and even understanding the South\u2019s dialect, peppered with English slang, were also monumental challenges. \u201cWhat I saw when I came to South Korea was overwhelming,\u201d says Pak, who arrived in Seoul at the end of 2016. \u201cNorth and South Korea are totally different. I had no idea what a credit card was, and that\u2019s used everyday here.\u201d Pak was smuggled from the North through China and eventually ended up in a safe house in Thailand, where he learned about the existence of the internet for the first time, and where his handlers showed him South Korean soap operas. The shows gave Pak his first glimpse of a Korean society different from his own, and he was immediately hooked. \u201cI went from only being able to see a narrow slice of the world and then suddenly everything was visible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very shocking.\u201d Pak is one of nearly 100 North Korean students at the Yeomyung school in Seoul, a place designed to teach those new to South Korean society. The school\u2019s mission is to educate \u2013 both a standard range of subjects and the quirks of assimilating \u2013 but there is also a hope its students will be at the forefront of a possible unification of the two neighbours. The recent meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in prompted a wave of euphoria across the country after the two declared they would work toward \u201can everlasting peace on the peninsula\u201d. While any solid plan for unification is a long way off, the lull in tensions has sparked new hope among students and teachers that was unimaginable just a few months ago. \u201cWe want to become a model for education of North Koreans after unification,\u201d says Lee Hung-hoon, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cWe also want our students to become a force for unification, actively participating in the movement and spreading its message.\u201d \u2018We ate frogs, because we were so hungry\u2019 Good intentions aside, the school also exposes the chasm that still exists between ordinary citizens of the North and South, who have been separated for over six decades. During a recent biology class at the school, there was plenty of emphasis on the core material but also basic explanations of things like why university entrance exams were important at all. The students joked and misbehaved like any group of teenagers, but there were moments that exposed the trauma they have escaped. When the teacher turned to explanations of different types of animals, a picture of a frog flashes on a screen. \u201cWe used to eat that because we were so hungry in North Korea,\u201d one student says. \u201cWe don\u2019t just eat the back legs, we eat everything, it\u2019s very delicious.\u201d It was an unsentimental statement, said matter of factly, but it betrayed a hardship that few of his South Korean counterparts would ever experience. \u201cThey can be smiling and laughing during the day and then at night still be haunted by nightmares,\u201d says Hwang Heui-gun, a teacher at the school. \u201cBut they can\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s too painful.\u201d The school is covered in posters displaying poems about unification as well as religious quotes. The school is funded largely by donations from Christian groups and all the teachers are Christian, although the curriculum is not religiously focused. Severe economic disparities between the two neighbours also play out in the classroom. Some students are forced to drop out and find work in order to send money to family members back in North Korea or contribute to their journey to the South. \u201cBeing from North Korea causes isolation here,\u201d Lee says. \u201cSouth Koreans often unintentionally insult them due to lack of understanding about North Korea and lack of consideration.\u201d But Pak believes unification will happen in his lifetime. He hopes to become a doctor and when the borders open he plans to return to his home town near the border with China. \u201cThe North Korean medical system isn\u2019t good and there aren\u2019t good doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen unification happens, I hope I can go back and help the people still suffering there.\u201d Additional reporting by Helen Kim and Max Kim"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
