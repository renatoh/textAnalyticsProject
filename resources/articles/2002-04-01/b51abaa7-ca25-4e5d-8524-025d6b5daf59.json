The book was a huge revelation to my generation, so I was a fan before I was a friend. Later, in about 1993, when The Folding Star came out and I was writing odd bits of journalism, I was sent off by The Guardian to interview him. The only thing I can remember about it was taping all this wonderfully urbane and amusing conversation and then I dashed home with my tape recorder and switched it on and, because both of us have such deep, rumbling voices, the only thing that came out was this mild mumbling. So I had to reconstruct it from memory and probably made it all up - but he didn't seem to mind. We see each other all the time. When we go out for a drink there's a kind of pool of people we regularly go out with - we are constantly in the same drinking, dancing, partying circle. We go clubbing all the time. For about the last eight years we've always managed to get New Year's Eve together. The gang hangs out at someone's house, then we go to a nightclub and dance until we fall over. We are similar in some ways, but mostly not. As a writer he's much more meticulous than I am and he works much, much slower and much more steadily - but I couldn't work like that. I work in intense bursts and then spend long periods lying on the sofa, thinking. As a person he's much cleverer than I am, he's more superficially respectable than I am and he's much posher than I am, but there must be something similar about us, because people are always mistaking us for each other. Alan Hollinghurst: I remember being interested to meet Philip but also slightly apprehensive, because he was reviewing my second novel and he had a reputation as being rather a terror of a reviewer. But he conducted the interview in a very subtle way and I ended up thinking I must have conned him unintentionally, because he wrote such a sweet and favourable account of me and credited me with cleverness I didn't really feel I'd displayed in the interview. Philip is an incredible reader. He'll read a 400-page novel in a morning. It can be rather crushing, because you say, 'I wonder if you've ever heard of...' (some obscure German novel you're rather proud to have discovered) and he'll say, 'Of course, I've read it five times and twice in German.' There's a game I like playing on him where I pick out the most obscure old LPs I've got and put them on, and he identifies them within four seconds. It is very hard to find a piece of music that he can't identify instantly. But I have one very unmemorable piece which I get him with every single time. We are very different types. He's energetic and volatile; I'm much calmer and slower and more ruminant. And like a lot of very brilliant and funny people he has a melancholy side as well, so I feel that's one way in which I sort of support him - I feel I calm him down sometimes and cheer him up at others. I've just come back from a writers' retreat in New York where there wasn't a telephone or anything, but he sent me weekly emails which I read at the local cybercafe. They were real little highlights of my week - I was very glad to have these rather lurid bulletins of what was going on in London. \u00b7 Philip Hensher's new book, The Mulberry Empire (\u00a317.99 Flamingo), is out now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
