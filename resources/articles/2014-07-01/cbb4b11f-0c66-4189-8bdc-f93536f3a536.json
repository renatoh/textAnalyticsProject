Make no mistake, this sci-fi action platformer game remains one of gaming's true milestones: its minimalistic designs and smooth animation, remastered for HD with clean edges and detailed backgrounds, are as striking today as they were on the Amiga back in 1991. But it's demanding gameplay, requiring pixel-precise control of protagonist Lester (a physicist transported to an alien world, desperate to return home), may frustrate now. Part of Another World's charm was its difficulty, leaving players to figure out controls and puzzles without any onscreen hints or displays. While that still holds, slow movement and response to input isn't endearing. Being able to switch between original and updated visuals is a nice touch, but one that reinforces this as more of a history lesson. Great for nostalgics, but unlikely to impress newcomers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
