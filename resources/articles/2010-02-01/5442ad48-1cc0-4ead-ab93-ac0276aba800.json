Her daughter Lourdes is dead along with her month-old granddaughter. The entire family, all immigrants from neighbouring Peru, were trapped inside a building in Santiago that collapsed during Saturday's pre-dawn earthquake. As the two-minute long tremors tore apart the walls and ceilings, the Diaz family managed to climb through the wreckage and made it to the street in the Estacion Central neighbourhood the Chilean capital. Then a hail of cement buried Lourdes and the baby alive. Desperate neighbours tore through the rubble. They found the mother breathing but mortally injured. The baby was already dead. Now her husband Adan Saavedra stares at the walls. His left cheek bandaged heavily and his family and house destroyed. As immigrants, they lived in older housing, an estimated 120 people packed into five homes, which today are so damaged by the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that they must be demolished. \"I came here to take care of my pregnant daughter,\" said Rosario Diaz, who arrived in Chile from Peru a month ago. \"And now she is dead.\" On a nearby street corner, dozens of families dragged their mattresses to sleep on the streets. They feared after-shocks would topple what remained of their homes. \"No one brings us anything, we are stuck here,\" said Daniel Garcia, 28, another Peruvian immigrant who spent the night sleeping on the street with his family. They used wreckage from the street to build a makeshift shelter. His wife Rosa was desperate. \"I have to work tomorrow. What do I do with my daughter? That wall is about to fall! That's why I slept on the street,\" she said. Two blocks away, Liliana Caceres, also Peruvian, slept on the pavement on her sofa. \"It is safer here on the street than inside there,\" she said pointing to her apartment inside a three-storey cement building that now tilts heavily. \"At any moment the whole building could come down.\" Next to Caceres, children slept in a tent donated by neighbours. Surrounding the group were piles of clothes, canned fish and what little else the families were able to salvage from their humble home which they rented for \u00a370 a month. At sunrise yesterday, people went back into their homes to recover goods and food, but left quickly again at 8am, when a 6.3-magnitude aftershock hit the country, knocking down more buildings and further complicating rescue efforts. Travel across much of the country was paralysed as the airports and bus terminals remained closed. Cracks 20 metres long zigzagged along major roads, opening up holes large enough to swallow a motorcycle and snarling traffic on the traditional end-of-summer weekend. Inspection crews closed many bridges, overpasses and sections of highways throughout central Chile to evaluate fully the extent of the damage to infrastructure. Emergency workers fanned out from Santiago yesterday and headed south to a 600km long stretch of the country where the majority of people have no access to food, water or electicity. Communications, even in the larger cities, was sporadic. Outlying villages and smaller cities have yet to see signs of outside aid. \"Our biggest problem is in the Juan Fernandez region [the Robinson Crusoe Islands],\" said Ivan de la Maza, regional governor of hard-hit Valparaiso. Ocean swells, estimated at 9 metres high, demolished the coastal villages in the islands, which are more than 700 kilometres west of the mainland. Island residents did not feel the earthquake. Most of them were asleep when, at 6am on Saturday, huge ocean swells flooded the town. Rescue crews arrived yesterday and found that the 9-metre (30ft high) tsunami nearly erased whole villages as it churned houses and boats into mountains of debris which were then pulled back into the Pacific. Aerial photographs gave the impression a huge rake had been pulled from shore to the ocean, leaving few fragments of the community intact and entire streets erased. In addition to the 600 locals, an estimated 200 tourists were visiting the islands, many of them staying at waterside bed and breakfasts known as residenciales. With most homes built of wood and lightly balanced on foundations, the structures first floated inland, then were smashed by subsequent swells described by the local mayor as \"a train\" of 3-metre (10ft) high waves. The Robinson Crusoe islands even in normal conditions are remote and present extremely complicated airplane access. The runway is not near the town but on the far side of the island, ensuring all visitors and goods must be ferried by small skiff through rough seas. \"We have sent a frigate with basic foods and generators for the hospital and to reestablish communications as well as fresh water,\" said de la Maza. \"This will allow us to solve problems and get help to the people in the higher parts and the caves.\" Inland, in the city of Concepcion, firefighters continuted to search for survivors in a collapsed apartment building. \"It fell at the moment the earthquake began,\" said 4th Lt. Juan Schulmeyer of Concepcion's 7th Firefighter Company, pointing to where the foundation collapsed. A full 24 hours later, only 16 people had been pulled out alive, and six bodies had been recovered. \"The apartments are totally destroyed. You have to work with great caution,\" said Paulo Klein, leading a group of rescue specialists from Puerto Montt.\"It's very difficult working in the dark with aftershocks, and inside it's complicated.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
