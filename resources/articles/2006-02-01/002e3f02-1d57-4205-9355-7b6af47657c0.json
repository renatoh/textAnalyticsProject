The claim that a billion people will simultaneously, or by courtesy of edited highlights, watch a film awards ceremony seemed far-fetched to say the least. The Baftas may have improved in recent years but the event is still not exactly the Oscars. But there is a rational explanation. The ceremony has, its organisers say, been sold to \"231 countries and territories\". Now, my eight-year-old has a book of flags which runs to 194; there are 191 member states of the United Nations; and there is a number of arguments about how one classifies Palestine, the Western Sahara, East Timor and so on. The definition of \"territory\" could be a little loose, so while some of us might feel sceptical, one has to take Bafta at its word when it says 231 states, dominions and principalities are taking its coverage. But for an audience of a billion to be achieved this would mean one in six of the world's population sitting down to watch this second or third, or maybe fourth, most important film ceremony in the world. In fact, the average audience for each of the 231 territories will have to be a tad over 4 million. So one hopes that, for instance, the Chinese are pretty keen on George Clooney, as Vatican City, Tuvalu, Nauru and Palau would struggle to drum up 50,000 viewers even if there was a law requiring everyone to watch the Baftas - and who is to say there isn't? It is a little harsh to pick on the poor old Baftas as they are not sole offenders in the sport of global audience \"guesstimation\". With the World Cup a mere three months away, the worldwide television audience is bandied around as being around the 1.7 billion mark - which is more credible than Bafta's audience suggestions, as it takes place over a month. Though I will spare the blushes of one corporate hospitality group which insisted on its website that the World Cup drew from a worldwide audience of \"40 billion\". In fact, Steve Pond of the LA Times, who writes an excellent Oscars blog, recently quoted the Academy Awards executive director Bruce Davis as saying two years ago: \"There has never been a television event in the history of the world that has had a billion viewers - it's a handy number to throw around but it's not true.\" The number of people who allegedly watched the long, drawn-out boreathon of the World Cup draw was estimated as 350 million. Again, this seems an absurdly high number for a deathly dull \"event\", where at least half the available audience would either have been in bed or at work depending on the time zone. The truth is worldwide audiences are impossible to measure and easy to over-estimate as no one is likely to challenge your fundamental assertions. Equally, local audiences are supposedly measured with great accuracy, yet the way we calculate television ratings is pretty Neanderthal when compared to what can be measured on the web, for instance, where numbers are horrifyingly specific. One intriguing possibility of the fast-turning cycle of technological innovation is that, as television programmes move from being broadcast as they are at the moment to being \"served\" as content is over the internet, then the opportunity will arise for far more accurate audience measurement. Broadcasters are not necessarily eager for this innovation. Television advertising still maintains a gloss and a premium other media can only aspire to, and much of this revolves around the central canard that a programme audience is the same as the audience for its advertising. A billion people may indeed watch the Baftas, but I would lay odds of a billion to one against it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
