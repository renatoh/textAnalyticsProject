The scheme will only affect organisations that regularly send large amounts of email, rather than the average person who sends a few to friends. And sending emails will remain free. The charging system, to be introduced in the next few months, introduces fees of between 0.25 and 1 US cent per message: it will ensure that the emails do not have to pass through spam filters and are guaranteed to arrive, with a graphic indicating they are authentic. The service, which will be run for the two companies by Goodmail, from Mountain View in California, is allegedly intended to provide protection against \"phishing\" emails that claim to come from banks and other online companies. Normal spam filters can strip out image attachments and weblinks used by spammers and phishers to infect PCs or take people to phishing websites. But there's no obligation on companies to use the service, which could prove confusing for users, who might not know whether particular companies have signed up to it. The chief executive of Goodmail, Richard Gingras, told Redherring.com that the floor price for protecting email is reasonable, since email marketers have told him they can earn on average about 22 cents for every message sent. But equally, with AOL and Yahoo having two of the largest email bases in the world, all three companies stand to become very rich if enough companies cough up. However, it does raise questions about the rise of a tiered internet in which some participants get favoured treatment. \"That differs from the basic architecture of the internet from its inception, which treats all data in the same way,\" Jonathan Spira, chief analyst at Basex, an IT research firm, told Red Herring. Some spammers have optimistically tried to sign up with Goodmail. Gingras says they have been rebuffed. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
