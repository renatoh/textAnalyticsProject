Desperate not to miss out on potential new signings before the transfer window shuts next month, Allardyce said: \"They [the new regime running Newcastle] don't quite understand yet that if you don't move quickly you'll miss out. We've had a complete change at this club and it's totally understandable but we must try and move as quickly as we possibly can. \"The list of top players available is rapidly running out and we don't want to fall too far behind other clubs. I have to try and be patient but unfortunately I'm not very patient at this time of year. It's not just teams like Manchester United and Liverpool who are spending millions but Tottenham, West Ham, Fulham and Wigan. We started off [in the transfer market] at a sprint but we've begun to lag behind and we don't want to get left behind.\" Allardyce has already acquired Joey Barton from Manchester City, David Rozehnal from Paris St-Germain, Mark Viduka from Middlesbrough and Geremi from Chelsea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
