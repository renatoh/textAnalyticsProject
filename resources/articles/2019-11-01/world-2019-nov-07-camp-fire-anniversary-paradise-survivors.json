One year after the deadliest fire in California history tore through Paradise, the town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada is slowly coming back to life. And its former and current residents are navigating a life for ever changed. Last November, the fast-moving Camp fire forced tens of thousands of people in the town and the surrounding communities of Concow and Magalia to flee. Eighty-five people lost their lives in the inferno. More than 18,000 buildings, including 14,000 homes, were left destroyed. The disaster has been devastating, particularly for those without means. About 90% of Paradise\u2019s population of 27,000 remains dispersed into nearby valley towns and cities across the United States. The estimated 3,000 who remain, living in homes that survived the fire or in trailers on burnt-out lots, are still trying to figure out how to move on. The town itself has begun to look and feel different now that crews have cleared more than 2.6m tons of debris. Some schools in town have reopened. Along Skyway, one of the main thoroughfares in town, plenty of lots still lie empty, but there are also grocery stores, antique shops and gas stations up and running. About a dozen food trucks have popped up around town. \u201cI think we\u2019ve turned the corner in the past couple months,\u201d said Michael Zuccolillo, a Paradise town councilman. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more rebuilding. More businesses reopening. People more hopeful. The air just feels different.\u201d Paradise will never be the same place it was, residents agree, but a new version of the town is emerging, spurred forward by those trying to help it rebuild. Bryan Howard, a former farmer from Chico, came out of retirement to start his Bootleg BBQ food truck in Paradise. \u201cThe first month was a lot harder \u2013 it was almost like people who ate here were still in shock,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. We\u2019re seeing more smiles. I can see progress.\u201d For those whose homes survived the fire such as Marna Carli, the opening of businesses and new construction are a hopeful sight. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d Carli said as she cut cake for guests at the Paradise Symphony Orchestra. \u201cI\u2019m real hopeful for our community. Paradise is a special place, and I think it\u2019s going to be a new and better place.\u201d The future of Paradise looks promising, town officials such as Zuccolillo say, and will be aided by ongoing support from the state government and a $270m settlement with PG&amp;E, the bankrupt utility whose equipment caused the fire. The utility has also agreed to pay to put the town\u2019s power lines underground. That funding will help pay for expensive projects such as constructing a long-desired sewer system. Zuccolillo, who plans on rebuilding his home in the coming years, expects the town will continue to grow over the next five to 10 years. In the near future, Paradise is focused on clearing out some of the nearly half a million dead trees, and bringing people back. More than 300 building permits have been issued so far. Still, life for those who are staying put in the region can be challenging. Anastasia and Daniel Skinner and their five children found a home for rent in Magalia earlier this year after their home burned down in the Camp fire. But soon after, Daniel lost much of the income from his county-funded job, and repeated power shutoffs have made the family\u2019s life in the house complicated. Three of their children have special needs, and one relies on a nebulizer for breathing treatments, which she wasn\u2019t able to use during the outage. In the blackouts, they lost weeks\u2019 worth of groceries and had to utilize a food bank. Their generator was recently stolen. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to live here with the power outages. It\u2019s almost unlivable because you\u2019re still living in the wreckage of what\u2019s left. It makes it hard to survive,\u201d Anastasia said. The family is now preparing to give up their rental home and move into the RV they bought earlier this year that is parked on their old lot. They are committed to staying, primarily because their daughter, who has autism, needs the stable, accommodating environment that her school offers. Driving past the remaining debris and even the empty lots is a reminder of everything they lost. \u201cNobody wants to live through this, it\u2019s still horrifying having to drive down Skyway. It\u2019s desolate,\u201d Skinner said. Outside of Paradise Some people can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 return, unable to afford the cost of rebuilding or fearful of life in an area at risk for wildfires. In fact, most of those who lived in Paradise and the surrounding communities a year ago, no longer do. Many have stayed in California, particularly Butte and Glenn counties, where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has established housing sites for some of those affected by the fire. The largest is in Gridley, a town of 6,600 about 30 miles south of Paradise, where several hundred former residents of Paradise, Concow and Magalia, live. The site, which was constructed earlier this year, has some 400 uniform, light grey manufactured homes that line neat, newly paved roads. Though just off the highway, it is quiet and monitored by security guards 24 hours a day. On a recent Sunday afternoon, as the sun began to set, Alexis and Matthew Kogut, walked through the site with their five-year-old son, Hunter, and their infant daughter. \u201cDid you know the fire was burning my house?\u201d Hunter said before skipping ahead of the family. These evening walks have become part of their routine since they moved into a two-bedroom unit at the site in August. Before that they had spent seven months in a hotel near Sacramento. The family is grateful for their new, albeit temporary, home in Gridley. They have friends a few units down. And their new place is roomier and quiet \u2013 Hunter finally stopped having the excruciating night terrors that plagued him since the family fled their town in flames. They left that day thinking they would return \u2013 they had been evacuated before \u2013 but lost everything, including their two cats and the nursery they had set up for Kori, who was born shortly after the fire. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful. We think it\u2019s amazing all the work they put in,\u201d Alexis said, her eyes scanning the tidy rows of homes. Meanwhile Hunter talked about his new toys, and sprinted across the pavement to show how fast he could run. They seemed to be the only ones outside that afternoon at the 72-acre site. After the family finished their walk and arrived back at their temporary home, Matthew and the kids went inside while Alexis stood in the dark next to the porch, reflecting on how things had changed in a year. The fire had destroyed everything: their home, their community and a way of life they loved. Their unit at the Fema site gave Alexis, 25, and Matthew, a disabled veteran, more security. But they still felt at a loss for what they would do next. \u201cI can\u2019t stand that we\u2019re not stable. We live on a fixed income. I\u2019m pregnant with a third child. It\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. Alexis doesn\u2019t know where they\u2019ll go, but it won\u2019t be Paradise. Instead they\u2019ll look for the qualities they loved most about the town \u2013 its affordability and location in the mountains \u2013 somewhere else. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the same. It\u2019s going to be a smaller, wealthier community,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I lost my life that day and I don\u2019t really want to relive that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
