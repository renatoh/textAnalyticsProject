Name a solution, any solution \u2013 Nauru, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Pacific, poor old Christmas Island, whatever out-of-sight, out-of mind local location you could think of \u2013 and now, of course, the inhumane and unprecedented Manus Island PNG wing-and-a-prayer, buck-passing solution. Whether or not any of them make sense, they all meet the ultimate cop-out: the \u201cnot-in-my-bloody backyard solution.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a political genius to work out that this current bout of fear and loathing has precious little to do with individuals from some remote foreign starting point prepared to risk everything \u2013 including death \u2013 to get to our cherished continent. It\u2019s about votes, votes and more votes. And for the rest of us out here in voter-land, it\u2019s an invidious choice between the lesser of evils. At least we know Rudd and Abbott agree on one thing. Neither of them has an honourably workable clue how to get the nation out of the quagmire it\u2019s been in for decades on this sorry issue. Motivated by domestic politics, they are battering each other to convince us that once elected, they will stop those nasty people smugglers and their leaky boats. As a result, fewer would-be refugees, will die and our borders will be more secure. In other words, an over-night miracle achieved, that will be touted as Australia\u2019s contribution to tackling the worsening humanitarian calamity of 45 million displaced men, women and children around the globe \u2013 as distinct from the measly half of one percent of them causing us political apoplexy here in Australia. Meanwhile, the dragged out, politically amoral duck-shoving on the issue must surely have damaged this country\u2019s reputation as a \u201cgood global citizen.\u201d Or maybe that doesn\u2019t bother us? Don\u2019t ask foreign minister, Bob Carr. Amazingly, Carr has decided to write off most asylum seekers as unacceptable economic refugees. As for Scott Morrison, Abbott\u2019s shadow immigration spruiker, he spends his waking hours befuddling us with double-speak about pushing, towing or turning the boats back to somewhere \u2013 anywhere, so long as it\u2019s not Australia! Respected experts counsel that this country\u2019s bi-partisan failure to implement widely-accepted international human rights standards on asylum seekers is at odds with its moral and legal obligations under the UN convention on the status of refugees, the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre for having a UN high commissioner for refugees, the law of the sea, let alone our own migration act. James Hathaway, an expert on international refugee law and professorial fellow at Melbourne University, points out that Rudd\u2019s PNG deal is without international precedent. \u201cThis plan is without question the most bizarre overreaction I have seen in more than 30 years of working on refugee law,\u201d he recently told Radio National Breakfast: It makes no sense. The only mandatory deportation to PNG is going to be so-called boat arrivals. Does the prime minister think that every refugee should arrive with a Qantas first class ticket in order to be real? Hathaway says the UN convention decrees that a country cannot penalise refugees \u201cfor arriving without authorisation.\u201d This, and the Rudd plan to dump them on PNG are both an illegal and discriminatory penalty. Hathaway goes even further, asserting that Australia\u2019s refugee crisis \u201cdoesn't really exist compared to other developed countries,\u201d pointing out that our annual in-take of around 30,000 refugees is \u201ca totally average, absolutely manageable number.\u201d What Hathaway found \u201cstriking\u201d was that unlike any developed nation he had experienced, Australia has been attracting genuine refugees as boat arrivals almost exclusively. Yet it was these so-called \u201cboat people\u201d who have attracted Rudd and Abbott\u2019s mutual ire. \u201cIt\u2019s the most extraordinarily bizarre singling out of the very group that ought to be the one we should care about the most.\u201d Given Australia\u2019s politically expedient bi-partisan obsession with so-called \u201cboat people,\u201d in the run-up to the 2010 Federal Election, the author interviewed Sydney University professor Mary Crock, an international migration law expert. Her take amounted to an intriguing \u201cpsycho-political\u201d explanation. \u201cI think Australians have a deep historical fear of invasion by the sea,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re not unique in that respect. Many countries around the world overreact when people come by boat to seek asylum.\u201d I asked whether she was suggesting that because until quite recently countries were invaded by boats, Australians are more worried by refugees trying to get here by boat? \u201cThere are certainly historic precedents for that,\u201d she said. The salient fact is that most potential refugees come to Australia by plane, rather than by boat, claim refugee status, and more often than not, get it. \u201cYes, we don\u2019t get concerned by that,\u201d Crock told me. \u201cPeople who come by plane are at least processed. They present their passports at the airport to get into the country, whereas people who come by boat often come without any documentation of any kind \u2013 no health or character checking at all.\u201d Hence, the government retains its tendency to view \u201cboat people\u201d as purely illegal immigrants who\u2019ve jumped the queue. Nevertheless, as has been pointed out ad nauseum in an inconclusive debate, it is not illegal to seek asylum. As I write, Rudd\u2019s latest off-shore solution, Manus Island, has been condemned as a \u201chell-hole\u201d and a \u201cgulag\u201d and Abbott\u2019s spanking new Colonel Blimp plan is to turn the waters off the West Australian coast into a virtual war zone by sending in the troops. Meanwhile, where do the rest of us go to seek asylum from Australian politicians?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
