England's head rugby union coach named a 43-man squad for next month's friendlies against Wales and France with seven other players making up a list of 50 that was submitted to the World Cup organisers for accreditation purposes. The Bath centre Catt, who suffered recurrent hamstring strains last season, and the Sale fly-half Hodgson, who damaged knee ligaments against Italy at Twickenham last March, were not named by Woodward, who will announce his World Cup 30 on September 8. Catt said he would be fit for the start of the new season and Hodgson hopes to be back in action within two months. \"This squad of players was chosen on the basis that everyone is fit to play in the three World Cup preparation games,\" said Woodward, who recalled the long-term injury victims Austin Healey and Lewis Moody along with the Bath lock Danny Grewcock, who missed last month's tour of New Zealand and Australia after being sent off in the Parker Pen Challenge Cup final for punching Lawrence Dallaglio. \"There are still a couple of players who have an outside chance of making the squad for the World Cup and I will be monitoring them through their clubs. This, however, will be subject to me seeing them play or being happy with their medical reports prior to that date.\" The only player in the squad of 37 that toured down under not to make the squad, or be named in the back-up list, was the Wasps flanker Paul Volley while Woodward has found room for Newcastle's fly-half Dave Walder. Woodward may name only five back-row forwards for the World Cup, depending on how many props he takes and whether he uses the prop Trevor Woodman as emergency cover at hooker, which will place the emphasis on versatility and enhance the claims of Martin Corry who has played at six, eight and seven as well as in the second row. Martin Johnson has been named as captain, even though Woodward is expected to choose a Test-strength side only for the third of the friendly internationals, against France at Twickenham. He is expected to mix and match against Wales in Cardiff and in Marseille, games unlikely to have the status of full internationals. There is no place for the rugby league convert Henry Paul, nor the Northampton prop Robbie Morris, who played in last season's Six Nations. Also omitted was the second row Hugh Vyvyan, England's captain in the recent Churchill Cup in North America, while the Gloucester No8 James Forrester, who missed out on the tours because of a wrist injury, is among the extra seven players named by Woodward.
