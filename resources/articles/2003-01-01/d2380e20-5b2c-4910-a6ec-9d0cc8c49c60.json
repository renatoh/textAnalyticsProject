Who needs Ricky Gervais beating up Grant Bovey for charity when Dirty Dickie Desmond and Jonathan, the fourth Viscount Rothermere, will do it for free? The prize is London. The date with destiny, sometime this spring. And the contest itself is much harder to call than you'd suppose. How can that be? The declaration of war comes from Richard Desmond (that 'appalling man', according to the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre). He intends to launch a second capital-wide daily freesheet, slyly titled the London Evening Mail. But, in publishing terms, he's no big cheese. His Northern and Shell is still a private company. He has no experience of evening papers or freesheets. He's attacking Rothermere's Metro - a well-established product, newly profitable and turned out to a winning formula, with rail and tube distribution sites sewn up. How on earth will Desmond distribute his paper? Worse, he's daring to attack the hegemony of the Evening Standard. Maxwell tried that 15 years ago and lost \u00a350 million in five months. Jonathan's dad, Vere, outfought and outsmarted him. So Desmond - touting only a paltry \u00a35m or \u00a36m investment package for the project - would seem outgunned. Surely, he must be on a hiding to nothing? Well, perhaps. The smart money and odds are stacked that way. But Desmond has been pretty smart since he bought the Express group 27 months ago. His Fleet Street critics said he knew a lot about porn and damn all about national newspapers. Yet Desmond has learned fast about running papers competitively on dramatically tight staffing. His Daily Star is winning awards for growth and feistiness and his two Expresses have recovered some lost ground. And the question here is the true nature of the game he's playing. Does he really hope to knock Associated off its London perch? If he does, then he's on a loser. But if his game is to make mischief and cause pain, then opportunity knocks. Think chess. Think move and counter-move. Find weakness in strength. Associated has two great problems. It started the Metro series - picking up an idea from some bright Swedes and gazumping them before they could get to London - with one significant difference. The Associated version mingled attack and defence. It could attack, rolling out regional editions in places like Birmingham and Manchester, taking on local rivals with nothing to lose. But in London the gambit was also defensive. Keep the Swedish marauders at bay. Safeguard the Evening Standard. Make sure that your Metro, withdrawn from distribution before the Standard's first edition goes on sale, is a partner - not an enemy draining yet more sales from the paid-for champion (down 60,000 in a decade and almost halved over the past 40 years, despite that monopoly). The Standard's power is also a weakness. Ask the crucial question. Is it a 'national' or a regional paper? Answer: if it were regional, then Associated's regional arm, Northcliffe Newspapers, would be running it - probably very successfully. Costs would be kept at a level to make Desmond purr. There'd be no star columnists making a fortune, and no glossy mags plugging four-star restaurants. There'd be local news, leaving a distinctive London mark. And there would also be strength in depth. Look down the lists of Northcliffe titles - in Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, Bristol, Plymouth, Exeter and so on - then glance across at the freesheets in all those places which underpin them. The market is wrapped up. Interlopers would find it very hard to break in. A saturated ad market has nothing to offer. The Standard doesn't have such a lean cost structure or defence mechanism. Home delivery has long since withered. It depends on news-stand sales, and that makes it vulnerable. What happens if potential buyers get a copy of the Evening Mail thrust into their hands before they get to a news-stand? Where's the Metro's advantage of tied rail and tube sites if active hawkers intercept punters outside station precincts? The hawking technique isn't imaginary. It's been very successfully used by the Telegraaf group in Amsterdam to defeat the invading Swedes. It is the obvious trick for Desmond to try to pull. Of course, it will be difficult. London is not Amsterdam. Robert Maxwell's doomed London Daily News foundered on the rock of making 17,000 deliveries to 600 retailers (with 200 vans) every day. The mighty clog of London's traffic meant humiliating defeat. But suppose Desmond targets more selectively and runs his Mail from early morning till early afternoon against both the Metro and the Standard ? If the product is right - and he's hired one of the original Swedes to make sure it is - and the timing is right, he could inflict substantial damage. Bang goes 100,000 of Metro's London 400,000; pop goes 50,000 from Standard circulation. That isn't victory - or anything but a short-term money loser. But it is substantial irritation. And how does Associated hit back? Not by attacking Desmond's hugely profitable TV porn channels and top-shelf magazines. So-called family newspapers can't tread that path. Not by launching a rival to OK magazine. That market is pretty crowded already. Not by prolonged price warfare against the Expresses. Viscount Rothermere's shareholders wouldn't be amused. The classic trick - putting out many more Metros through the day and swamping Desmond's modest effort - is available, but also a shot in the Standard foot. More perplexingly still, Desmond has a number of tackily effective counters ready to go. A free Express in London? An Evening Mail freesheet foray into Bristol or Nottingham? Desmond's advantage is that he is brash, small and mobile. The Daily Mail's burden is that it is too big, too hemmed in and, perhaps, too conventional. Associated's best hope is a distribution and editorial fiasco. Their worst fear is that the chippy little contender gets his basics spot on.
