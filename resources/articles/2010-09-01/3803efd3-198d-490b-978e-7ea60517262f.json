Since then? The albums have kept coming, but the world has moved on, and the band's leader, Rivers Cuomo, seems to have lost the sure touch he once had. This time he's been promising a return to form, and certainly Hurley seems devoted to the idea of the 90s \u2013 opener Memories harks back to the days when Weezer seemed like a fresh, slightly puzzled take on grunge: \"Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage/ Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave were still Rage.\" Sadly, Memories and the second track, Ruling Me, are much the standouts. The state of Cuomo's well of inspiration is indicated by the presence of cowriters-for-hire, including Linda Perry and Desmond Child, and in Where's My Sex Weezer have produced a song anyone older than 16 should feel ashamed to have even imagined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
