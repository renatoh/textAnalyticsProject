Garrett makes the assessment of the former Labor leader in his biography Big Blue Sky, due for release on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one to think it either,\u201d he told the Seven Network\u2019s Sunday Night program. Rudd demoted Garrett as environment minister over the government\u2019s controversial home insulation scheme. Four people died while installing the insulation as part of the Rudd government\u2019s hurriedly introduced scheme to pump money into the economy to stave off the effects of the global financial crisis. Garrett says in the book that supporting Rudd in light of his \u201ctrail of destruction and abandoned policy\u201d was his biggest mistake in nearly 10 years in parliament. \u201cI\u2019ve been particularly strong in this book about leadership and Rudd\u2019s leadership and I think it needed to be said,\u201d Garrett told the program. \u201cRudd wasn\u2019t someone who was easy to work with in that way, and his vanity and his exercise of power as prime minister was contrary ultimately, to me, to what good leadership is.\u201d A spokesman for Rudd\u2019s office said Garrett was simply looking for publicity. \u201cPeter Garrett is trying to sell a book. \u201cIf Mr Garrett were serious about these accusations he would have made them five years ago. Not try to rewrite history now.\u201d On the program Garrett also addressed his changing story about a donation from the clubs industry. In the original draft of the book he said he was given an envelope full of cash by a representative of Clubs NSW when he was an MP. Garrett repeated the claim in an interview for a forthcoming documentary on the poker machine interview, saying the envelope contained \u201chundreds, if not thousands of dollars\u201d, the ABC reported. But he subsequently maintained the envelope contained a cheque, and the event occurred before he was elected. \u201cI\u2019ve never said it was [a bribe] and I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m under any pressure,\u201d Garrett told Sunday\u2019s program. \u201cI think the important thing is to correct the record.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
