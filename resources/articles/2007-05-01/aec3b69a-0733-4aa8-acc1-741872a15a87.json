It is going to be Glasgow or Abuja in Nigeria for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The one is a nest of corruption and inter-religious factionalism, with abject poverty, elections nobody trusts and an oil wealth that has been shamefully squandered and scandalously expropriated. But that's Scotland for you. I have a thing about the sporting event formerly known as the Empire Games and have done ever since they came to my home town, Edinburgh, in 1970. I was nine and all that stuff about the 2012 Olympics inspiring kids resonates because those games had a big impact on me. When I am relentlessly pounding the streets of South London (jogging like Jimmy Savile) I still think of Lachie Stewart, his face contorted in agony, hurting for his country, reaching deep inside and winning the 10,000m gold for Scotland. It's a niche memory I grant you but many's the time it has got me out of the park, past the launderette, round the corner and home in a blaze of glory. So how do the two bids and the two cities compare? In standard they are much of a muchness. They both look magnificent. Glasgow is vibrant but venerable, a green games, forward looking but steeped in tradition. Abuja is purpose built and steeped in chrome and bougainvillea. The Nigerian capital is a stunning cityscape - Ridley Scott meets Richard Rogers. It may or may not trouble you, however, to know the government minister Nasir el-Rufai said, after bulldozing some \"illegal\" housing, it was not a city for the poor. He later clarified: \"We are not saying Abuja is not for poor people but it is definitely not a city for idlers either.\" There's another contrast with Glasgow then. My Edinburgh prejudice notwithstanding, Glasgow must be in pole position. You see, there are one or two problems with Abuja in particular and Nigeria in general and I don't just mean demolition man. I might best explain by adducing Article 2 of the Commonwealth Games Federation constitution, which earnestly promotes \"gender equality and tolerance\"; or Article 7, which says \"there shall be no discrimination against any country or person on any grounds whatsoever including race, colour, gender, religion or politics\". That is clear enough, then, and that is Abuja scuppered, then. Nigeria's criminal code states that anyone who has \"carnal knowledge of any person against order of nature or permits a male to have carnal knowledge of him\" is liable to 14 years in prison. Currently going through parliament is the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, which slaps a five-year sentence on anyone who \"performs, witnesses, aids or abets the ceremony of same sex marriage\" and also on anyone involved \"publicly or privately in positive representation of or for same sex relationships\". Sharia law, operating in many northern states, holds it is God's requirement that gay people should be stoned to death but, to be thankful for small mercies, Abuja is not in the north. Frankie says Relax. Homophobia seems to be all the rage in Nigeria. The Lagos Guardian makes the Daily Telegraph letters page look like Gay Times. How's this?: \"From what I can see, the law attempts to prevent the decadence of western societies on the issue of homosexuality such as gay marriage (a contradiction in terms) and adoption of children by gay couples (a travesty, if people want children, let them marry people of the opposite sex). What is wrong with that? Tomorrow, if the western world decides that paedophilia is OK, must we agree with them?\" Of course, there are myriad and labyrinthine arguments here about moral relativism, double standards, sport, politics and boycotts. After the cancelled cricket tour, is Zimbabwe's ambassador to Australia right when he say politics has no place in sport? Of course he isn't but what about Beijing? And remember the 1980 Moscow Olympic boycott. Was that not over some superpower invasion of Afghanistan? Moving swiftly on, the fact is that by its own hardly lofty but merely perfectly reasonable principles, the Commonwealth Games Federation has disqualified many of its members from ever holding the games. What a world. Mike Hooper, the chief executive of the CGF, was rather short with me when I asked him about Nigeria's human rights problems. \"As to the final decision-making of our membership and whatever issues they take into account and how they cast their vote - that is a matter for them.\" With respect, it is not. It is surely a matter for the constitution and the constitution says \"no\". I rang Ben Summerskill from Stonewall. He said: \"The games is meant to be a celebration of high ideals as well as sportsmanship. To invite people to a country where they are liable to be imprisoned seems inimical to any claim they're keen to engage them in competitive sport.\" The games belong to Glasgow. Can I be the first to congratulate them? Brown's painful discovery that what goes around comes around With all this talk of Gordon Brown, I've been thinking a lot this week about Gordon Brown. Not he of the moral compass and Raith Rovers, but the great Scotland and Lions second-row forward of the same name who died in 2001. He was a special man. I was lucky enough to meet \"Broon frae Troon\" on a few occasions. He once told me a lovely story that just so beautifully epitomises the ethos of rugby and the very spirit of sport. The first time he faced the great hooker Colin Deans he remembers smacking Deans in the face as they contested a ruck. Welcome to big-time rugby, kid. Gordon told me in his soft Ayrshire burr, \"A few minutes later I was chasing play on the other side of the pitch when I felt this almighty whack on the back of my head which knocked me for six. When I got my senses back I looked up and I saw wee Colin trotting off in front of me and I thought 'good for him'\". Tevez's new role as leading Premiership Marxsman I love the Marx Brothers. Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Mascherano and - Tevez was it? I never forget a face but in his case I'll make an exception. Honk! Remember that marvellous contract scene from A Night at the Opera? Did it not go something like: \"The party of the first part shall be known in this contract as the party of the first part. The party of the second part shall be known in this contract as the party of the second part. It is the whole part of the third-party part of the deal that is the bad part. Why, this is so simple a five-year-old child could understand it! Someone get a five-year-old child.\" Not far off it anyway. Why is it, when I read about the whole imbroglio (was he one of the Marx brothers?), I just think of long-dead comedians? Either this man is dead or my watch has stopped. Frankly, it is the two Argentinians who are at fault. They should have followed Groucho's advice and refused to join any club that would have them as players. Honk honk. The pain of sad little men \"This is such bollocks; sad little men making pathetic points about nothing.\" From my wife's reaction you'll gather that this sad little man had to turn off the football phone-in as we all travelled back from a family do at the weekend. Harry Potter CDs went in and calm was restored to the back seat. The truth is, football matters a hell of a lot to us. A study has revealed that fans think about the game once every 12 minutes. Seven per cent of fans think about football once every minute and, with some irony, top of that league are Sheffield United supporters. They think about the Blades on average 110 times a day whereas Manchester United fans spare a mere 71 thoughts. This confirms my theory, that when it comes to football, the Marquis de Sade (a Leeds season-ticket holder) was right: \"We are much more keenly affected by pain than by pleasure.\" He also said that love is a form of insanity. You'd think Mrs Campbell would understand that one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
