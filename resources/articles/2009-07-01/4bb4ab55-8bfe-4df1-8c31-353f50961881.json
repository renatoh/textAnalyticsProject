And there have been other times where he has been called in to see videos.\" In the aftermath of his selection as captain this year Montgomerie had spoken emotionally about receiving the endorsement of the European Tour's players committee \u2013 the same one that upbraided him four years ago over his conduct during the Indonesian Open, where he appeared to take an incorrect drop after a rain delay. Lyle's other comment was a reference to the 2002 Volvo Masters, when Montgomerie was asked by rules officials to look at footage which appeared to show his ball moving as he was about to address it. No penalty was imposed after the Scot confirmed to those officials he had not grounded his club and he went on to share the title with Bernhard Langer. After the Indonesian Open incident, Montgomerie was cleared of any wrong-doing by rules officials but subsequently he apologised for an \"unwitting error\" and donated his \u00a324,000 prize money to charity. That was supposed to be that, although a small but dedicated band of naysayers will never forget or forgive. Clearly Lyle is a paid-up member of that club, although his criticism of his fellow Scot will inevitably be viewed against the backdrop of the two men's complicated personal relations. At one stage Montgomerie was Lyle's most public supporter for the job of the Ryder Cup captain in 2010 \u2013 at least he was until he got the job himself. Since then, according to Lyle, the pair have had minimal contact. \"I rang him a few times after the decision but didn't hear back. Eventually I got a letter but I got the impression it was written by his manager,\" he said. Lyle, who won the 1985 Open at Royal St George's and the 1987 Masters, is the only member of European golf's so-called Big Five from the 80s and 90s who has never captained a Ryder Cup team. He had long campaigned for, and believed he would get, the job in Wales next year. Lyle then hinted he would gladly accept the job of vice-captain in 2010 if asked by Montgomerie, although that would now seem unlikely, to say the least."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
