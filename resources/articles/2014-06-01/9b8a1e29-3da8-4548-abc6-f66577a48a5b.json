Successive defeats by Italy and Uruguay left England bottom of Group D and Costa Rica\u2019s win over Italy rubberstamped their exit on Friday. Those setbacks have placed greater scrutiny on Hodgson\u2019s tenure, yet the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, last night offered his public backing for the 66-year-old having told him during a telephone conversation on Thursday night that he wanted him and his coaching staff to stay on. \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of Roy Hodgson. We\u2019ve asked him to stay as manager,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not see any value in changing. We think Roy has done a good job and it is an approach over four years and we hope to do better in the European Championships.\u201d Hodgson has two years still to run on a \u00a33m-a-year contract and has no intention of resigning. Indeed, those within the Club England set-up feel Hodgson has cultivated the best team spirit for years and will continue to offer him their backing regardless of the result against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. The manager himself has defended England\u2019s approach at the finals and claimed that the future remains bright. \u201cI believe the team going forward will be a very good team,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cI think there are good young players. Even against Uruguay we saw some good individual performances and the young ones that came on did quite well. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to have any doubts this England group of players will go on to do good things in the time ahead. But results colour everything. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard and done so much preparation for this tournament. We think we came here well prepared. But we\u2019ve failed. We obviously had really big hopes we were going to make the nation proud by going far in the tournament and we haven\u2019t done that. So any words on the other subjects are pretty empty at the moment.\u201d The strength of the 66-year-old\u2019s relationship with Gareth Southgate, who is overseeing the Under-21s, will also work in the senior manager\u2019s favour, with that link considered key in terms of the future development of the national side. Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley have all now tasted life at a major tournament \u2013 although the Southampton full-back has yet to feature \u2013 and Hodgson said he had no regrets over the way England approached the finals in Brazil. Indeed he stood by his squad selection despite Stuart Pearce among others criticising the approach. \u201cOther countries must look at us and laugh at times, they really must,\u201d the former manager of the Under-21s said. \u201cThe team is evolving,\u201d added Hodgson. \u201cI think it will continue to evolve, of course. I\u2019m proud of the way they\u2019ve approached this tournament and everything they\u2019ve put into it. At the moment I\u2019m just devastated they\u2019ve got nothing out of it. Maybe I\u2019m too close to it. You see things from a different perspective, a different height, but I don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve done much more on Thursday. The Uruguayans are a very different team to play against than Italy. The Italians are quite an offensive team so they give you more chances on the counterattack and they give you more room to play. We didn\u2019t get much room to play from Uruguay but on the other hand they didn\u2019t do too much in our half of the field for long periods of time. \u201cI\u2019m very low. So are the players. We had high hopes, we thought we could make an impact. But unfortunately we haven\u2019t won the games. To make an impact you\u2019ve got to win games and we\u2019ve lost both. We\u2019ve had an approach. That approach has not wavered. But we\u2019ve conceded four goals and scored two. It\u2019s not much more complicated than that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
