A central plank of Labour's campaign is that the Tory candidate, Edward Timpson, is \"one of them\", a posh boy who has not got a clue how people in a down-to-earth place such as Crewe think and feel. Labour has mocked Timpson by dressing activists in top hats and morning suits, continually pointed out that he lives in a \u00a31.5m mansion, and has gleefully drawn attention to the \"exotic South American llamas\" that roam the fields around his country pile. But a quick visit to the Timpson pad 15 miles north of Crewe reveals that not all is as it seems. Certainly, his house is lovely, enjoying splendid views across to the giant Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank. But the lush fields that feature in the Labour photograph of his home are not his. And the llamas belong not to him, but to a local farmer. The roping of the llamas into the Labour campaign is one of the \"dirty tricks\" that Tory leader David Cameron claims he is receiving reports of every evening. \"It makes me rather sad,\" said Cameron, speaking on a visit to a rail freight yard in Crewe on Thursday. \"I don't think people want to judge you on your background. They want to know if you're any good at your job. Labour likes looking back, they like class division, they like class war.\" He would say that, of course, but it is becoming clear that the tactics are also grating with grassroots Labours stalwarts and supporters. Maureen Grant, a Labour councillor defeated in the May council elections, said: \"Some voters on the doorstep have played heck about it. They think it's childish. It's very hard work out there.\" She would love Gordon Brown to visit the Cheshire town in advance of Thursday's vote, not because she thinks it will help Labour win, but so she could give him a piece of her mind about how difficult the abolition of the 10p tax rate has made it for the local party. \"I feel sad that our national party did us such a disservice.\" He is unlikely to come - the nearest he may get is a local radio phone-in on Tuesday. Steve Hogben, the leader of the Labour group on Crewe borough council, said he believed locals were already fed up with the political \"circus\". He laughed ruefully when asked about the toff campaign. \"You'd better ask the professionals about that,\" he said. Another lifelong Labour party member, who asked not to be named, called the posh strategy hypocritical. She said Labour was only having to fight dirty because it had ignored pleas for years not to neglect core supporters, adding: \"We've got a lot of posh people in the party now.\" One of those \"posh\" Labour people on the campaign trail this week was Quentin Davies, the Grantham and Stamford MP who defected from the Conservatives last year. He was clearly uncomfortable with the \"posh boy\" tactics: \"It's not serious politics,\" he said. William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, was one of the big hitters in Crewe yesterday asking shoppers at the market for their votes. \"I don't think [Timpson] is posh, and we Rotherham boys can tell when someone is posh,\" was his conclusion. Desperation He added: \"I think it's a bit of a sign of desperation. You've got a government that can't find a direction of its own, and here you've got a campaign where they don't have any positive arguments. I don't think people are fooled by that really. We don't even think about people like that any more. We've moved on.\" Timpson, a barrister and former public school boy whose family have made a fortune from their key cutting and shoe repair business, said he was not hurt by the attacks. \"It's made me even stronger and more determined to lead a very positive campaign here on the local issues that matter to people. I don't think I'm posh. And the llamas definitely aren't mine.\" The Tory candidate argues that he does know how \"ordinary\" people live. Over 30 years his family fostered more than 80 children. They could not always afford holidays abroad and would go instead on \"cultural\" trips to the Midlands. Eric Pickles, Tory MP for Brentwood and Ongar, who is running the party's Crewe and Nantwich byelection campaign, accused Labour of playing a \"nasty and cynical\" game, fighting not only on class but race. One Labour campaign leaflet suggests Timpson opposes \"making foreign nationals carry an ID card\". Race is undoubtedly an issue in Crewe, which like many places across Britain is home to many workers from eastern Europe. \"Labour thinks that this will appeal to working class people because they are racist,\" said Pickles. \"They aren't and it won't. The people here are not racist and they are not stupid.\" Paul Whiteley, professor of government at Essex University, said he thought the \"street theatre\" of the posh boy campaign would only draw attention to a \"lost cause\". Nevertheless, he believes party strategists will be looking at how the tactic played out in Crewe to find out if it is worth rolling out across the country in a general election. \"It's like Barack Obama's problem with blue collar America. Cameron potentially has a problem with blue collar Britain. That's why I think they are doing this kind of street theatre,\" he said. Whiteley said the Labour tactics demonstrated that the party was moving away from the centre ground and reverting to a \"let's talk to our own people strategy\". High-profile stunts had little impact on how people voted, he said. \"There's a temptation to think that what's in the media is what will effect voting,\" he added. \"But it's more a matter of reaching the voters in their homes, in the shops.\" Labour's campaign team, which is led by Steve McCabe, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green and a government whip, remains convinced that its class attack is hitting the mark. Labour's candidate Tamsin Dunwoody, the daughter of the late MP Gwyneth whose seat she is fighting, is constantly referring to Timpson's wealth. \"You have to ask yourself seriously, can someone from a \u00a31.5m mansion represent people whose average house price is \u00a3184,000? Can someone with a \u00a353m family fortune represent someone who's on fifteen grand?\" she said. She has held photocalls at the supermarket, at the bingo and with Liz Dawn, who played Vera Duckworth in Coronation Street. Her campaign slogan, meant to tap into the constituency's regard for her much-admired mother, is \"one of us\". She claims her political opponents are being po-faced over the toff campaign. \"I think the greatest lesson from the top hats is that my opponents really have no sense of humour. Politics is a tough game but we don't always have to be boring and anoraky.\" Labour officials say the posh boy campaign has been successful because everyone in Crewe now knows Timpson has money, and attention has moved on from the 10p tax row. Unable to resist joining in the fun, the Liberal Democrats are quick to point out that Dunwoody's home is in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, 180 miles from Crewe and Nantwich. They accuse Labour of \"parachuting\" in a candidate who will win sympathy votes from Labour loyalists who adored her mother. And, they whisper, she keeps pigs at her smallholding. It is not clear if this is meant to make her seem posh, and anyway none were in evidence when the Guardian went to have a look yesterday. The value of her farmhouse is not known, though the one next door is on sale for \u00a3350,000 - not in the Timpson league, but double that of the typical home in the constituency she wants to represent. Balance For the sake of political balance, it is only fair to report that the Lib Dem candidate, Elizabeth Shenton, has an animal connection too. She lives with 10 cats - abyssinians and moggies - but bridles at being called a cat person. \"I'm not a cat person, I'm a person who has cats.\" She lives across the county border in north Staffordshire and works part-time for the Employment Tribunal Service. But does class and keeping of animals really matter? At the market in Crewe, Brenda Heron said she had always voted Labour but was turning Tory this time. What about Timpson's big house? \"Doesn't matter to me a bit - every English man should have his castle.\" And those llamas, even if they aren't really his? \"I've got three horses, 10 chickens and a greyhound. I'd love some llamas.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
