The smiling face of McKee, the gifted 29-year-old journalist and novelist who had been shot dead while she was reporting on rioting in Derry on 18 April 2019, gave me a shock of sadness. But I smiled when I saw her words on the wall: \u201cIt won\u2019t always be like this. It\u2019s going to get better.\u201d Having spent another morning with Gerry Storey, the inspirational 83-year-old boxing trainer at the Holy Family, it seemed as if sunshine lit up that dark green wall again. Storey has lived his life instilling the hope that resonates through McKee\u2019s words. He has used the violent business of boxing to spread peace and reconciliation for 60 years. Amid the many examples of his courage I thought of one specific encounter as I gazed at this new mural. On a Sunday night near the end of winter in 1972, Belfast looked like a ghost town. Storey would not have been surprised to see tumbleweed blowing through the empty streets or a creaking barroom door swing open as a gunman loomed into view. There were more guns, bombs and cowboys dressed in sinister black balaclavas than in a Hollywood movie. The burned-out husks of buses and cars were a silent reminder of recent rioting and bombings. These were bleak times but Storey, whose gym was found in the Republican area of New Lodge, offered hope and progress. He loved working with young fighters, watching them bloom between the ropes, and the Holy Family rules were sacrosanct. Once you stepped inside the gym you left the world outside. Before you reached the heavy bags dangling from steel hooks, and the speed balls waiting to be pummelled with rhythmic precision, you shed the Troubles. You trained to become a better boxer and a better person. When gyms from across the sectarian divide asked for help, Storey showed the same generosity. He travelled into Loyalist territory to pick up fighters or spend time in rival gyms. Most boxing clubs around Belfast had shut down. It was dangerous to operate at night and the few surviving gyms looked to the Holy Family as a template for the future. No one crisscrossed Belfast like Storey. He was always unarmed as he knew boxing obliterated division and strife. There could be no forbidden areas to a boxing man who moved easily from an IRA heartland to a UVF or UDA enclave. Storey was safe in New Lodge as the IRA links of his brother Bobby Sr, and his nephews Seamus and Bobby Jr, were respected. But the genial trainer had been summoned to meet the Loyalist Army Council just off the Shankill Road. He felt calm. If the paramilitaries warned him, he would simply explain his motives. Storey did not consider more ominous possibilities. He parked his car on a side street. One of three minders led Storey up a narrow stairwell to the first floor. The minder knocked on the door and waited. This moment would have turned the blood of most men cold. Yet, with one deep breath to steady himself, Storey walked into the room. A dozen men watched him approach. \u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, breaking the silence. \u201cGerry Storey,\u201d one of the men said, rising to his feet and extending his hand. Storey recognised Harry Burgess, Bob Morrison and Tucker Lyttle. He avoided looking too closely at anyone else. Too much knowledge in Belfast could be a dangerous thing. \u201cTake a seat, Gerry,\u201d Burgess said, pointing to an empty chair. The formality of the setting, and the seriousness of the men, meant Storey had not been wrong. These boys were the top Loyalist paramilitaries in the North. \u201cWe know what you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d another man said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never hid it.\u201d There was a long silence and then a different Loyalist leader leaned across the table. He was close enough that Storey could have ruffled the man\u2019s hair. \u201cWe understand what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe\u2019re behind you 100%.\u201d It was incredible \u2013 for many of the men were used to ordering the murder of a random Catholic or planning retaliatory attacks on Republican communities. Yet they were embracing a Catholic boxing trainer whose family was linked to the IRA. \u201cGerry,\u201d Burgess continued, \u201cwe\u2019d love you to run more of your shows on Rumford Street. Bring the kids from the Holy Family and box in our club.\u201d The Rumford Social Club, just off the Shankill Road, was an infamous meeting place for Loyalist paramilitaries. \u201cYou\u2019ll have our protection,\u201d a heavy-set man said, spreading his arms to indicate the full might of the UDA, the UVF and UFF. If Storey, the leading amateur trainer in Britain and Ireland, had not believed in the power of boxing, he would have thought it miraculous. \u201cIf anybody offends you, they will be dealt with severely,\u201d another man said, his gruff voice lacing that last word with menace. They would maim or kill anyone who offended him. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Storey said. \u201cMy boys will be delighted to box at the Rumford.\u201d The men rose to shake his hand. It was so harmonious that Storey wondered why it could not always be this simple. Why could only boxing bring them together? There were still three assassination attempts on his life over the years. The bitterness of those who opposed his peaceful work was stemmed only by orders from paramilitary leaders on both sides that Storey should be spared. There were often riots and shootouts around the Holy Family but a surreal ceasefire ensued whenever Storey\u2019s green Cortina cruised into view. The \u201cgunplay\u201d would abate until the trainer was safely inside the gym where he would work with Catholic and Protestant fighters. Two of Storey\u2019s best \u201cwee boxers\u201d, Hugh Russell and Davy Larmour, came from different backgrounds. Russell from New Lodge; Larmour from the Shankill. Years later, as professional fighters, they supplemented their boxing income with other work. Russell was on his way to becoming one of the great photographers of the Troubles and he had begun working at the Irish News. Larmour worked at the docks and drove a pirate taxi at night. They fought two savage battles. Yet there was no trouble outside the ring and Russell and Larmour, a Catholic and a Protestant, remained friends. That friendship was illuminated in the aftermath of their first brutal bout at the Ulster Hall in March 1982. A victorious but bloodied Russell moved towards his mother. Eileen Russell clutched her glasses in her left hand. She had hardly worn them all night as she could not bear to watch. Russell was still in the ring but his arms were outstretched, as if to tell his mum he needed her. Brendan Murphy, the renowned photographer who was Russell\u2019s mentor, framed his shot perfectly. He caught his battered protege leaning through the ropes to kiss his mother. Love and relief, mingled with tears and horror, were etched into Eileen\u2019s face. Murphy pressed the shutter just before they kissed. His black-and-white photograph distilled boxing\u2019s gory drama and bruising intimacy. Eileen Russell cried as she kissed her son. She wanted him to throw away the boxing gloves and pick up his camera for good. But she knew the urge to fight still pumped in his blood, which dripped on to the turquoise canvas. \u201cI won,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, son,\u201d Eileen smiled up at him through her veil of tears. \u201cYou won.\u201d The loser hurt all over. In the shower Larmour watched the blood run from his face, chest and legs before it disappeared down the plughole with water which turned red beneath his feet. He lifted his tender face to the shower and winced. He had come so close to winning; but he would have to keep driving his taxi while he waited for the rematch. Larmour felt better as he towelled himself dry. The dressing room was silent as he pulled on his shoes and socks. His hands were bruised. He had hit Russell very hard, and very often. He was just about to pull on his jacket when an official came into the dressing room. \u201cDavy, how are you getting up to the hospital?\u201d the man asked. \u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d \u201cWould you take Hugh?\u201d the official asked. \u201cAye, no problem,\u201d Larmour said. \u201cGood man,\u201d the official murmured. The streets around the Ulster Hall had emptied and few would have seen two fierce rivals leave the scene of their epic fight together. When they got to Larmour\u2019s car, Russell stretched out in the back. It felt strange for Larmour to be driving again, as if he was back in his taxi, and he looked into the rearview mirror. He saw the fighting photographer\u2019s face, cut and swollen beneath the gauzy street lights. \u201cHow you doing, mate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m OK, Davy,\u201d Russell said. Larmour and Russell joked about being stopped at an army checkpoint. They imagined the confusion if British soldiers saw a beaten-up Protestant driving a bloodied Catholic to hospital. A nurse led them each to a bed in the same room. She pulled a screen between them to offer some privacy. Davy closed his eyes as he ached with fatigue. Eventually, a doctor walked in and took a long look at Larmour\u2019s face. \u201cOh my,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been badly hurt. Who did this to you?\u201d Davy pushed the screen away. \u201cHe did,\u201d he said with a laugh as he pointed at Russell, spread out on the adjoining bed. The doctor\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Russell\u2019s freckly face which needed 33 stitches, twice as many as Larmour. The two boxers had been through the bloodiest fight of their lives. Storey, who inspired them both, remained at the Holy Family rather than work as a professional trainer. He knew he could give hope to many more lives if he steered young fighters away from the paramilitaries. It did not prevent the Provisional IRA or the Loyalist UDA and UVF from respecting his work which ran counter to their aims. That respect had been most obvious in the weeks following the 1981 hunger strikes when Bobby Sands and nine other Republican prisoners starved themselves to death. They had been locked in a desperate struggle with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government as they protested against conditions in the Maze prison. With morale in the Maze at a new low, both Republican and Loyalist leaders in the cages asked for Storey to give them boxing tuition. For the next six months Storey went into the Maze twice a week. He would spend one afternoon in the Republican cages and another in the Loyalist cages. The prisoners were so uplifted that the opposing paramilitary groups in the Maze began talking to each other and even shared boxing equipment. It was the kind of hope I know Lyra McKee would have loved. The McKee mural is found on the edge of the Cathedral Quarter, where the bars and caf\u00e9s are full of bearded hipsters and stylish young women showing off their tattoos and piercings, looking as if they would be as at home in Berlin or Copenhagen as Belfast. Despite McKee\u2019s death, Belfast felt like a city of warmth and hope. The Holy Family, still surrounded by old IRA murals, is a five-minute walk away. I took even more comfort from the fact that, just a few hours later, the club would be crammed again with 30 boys and girls returning to the oasis of boxing to work with Gerry Storey \u2013 an irreducibly hopeful man who, even in the darkest of times, has always made Belfast a better place.
