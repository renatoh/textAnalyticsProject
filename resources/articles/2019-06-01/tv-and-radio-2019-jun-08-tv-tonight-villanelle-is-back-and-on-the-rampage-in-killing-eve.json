After an ultraviolent warm-up, everyone\u2019s favourite international assassin heads for London to get her revenge. Mike Bradley D-Day 75: Return to the Beaches 6pm, BBC Two Three hundred veterans of the largest seaborne landing operation ever staged board a ship to return to the D-day beaches in Normandy to commemorate the thousands of their comrades who never made it home. Touchingly, one former soldier says he just wants to \u201craise a salute to the real heroes\u201d. MB Harry Hill\u2019s Alien Fun Capsule 7.30pm, ITV \u201cWe\u2019re not doing points, this isn\u2019t The Chase!\u201d Harry Hill\u2019s surreal spin on celebrity panel shows has always been more interested in cultivating an anything-goes atmosphere of inclusive absurdity than doing something as boring as keeping score. The third series kicks off with a particularly seasoned guest list as Martine McCutcheon, Les Dennis, Alison Hammond and Sir Tom Courtenay heroically send themselves up in service to Harry\u2019s daft skits and silly bits, including an unexpected tribute to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Graeme Virtue The Voice Kids 8pm, ITV The years between seven and 14 are a key time in building kids\u2019 confidence, so what better way to do that than get them to sing to four people\u2019s backs in the vain hope they\u2019ll spin round and give them some attention? So begins a new series of The Voice Kids, with Jessie J joining coaches Will.i.am, Danny Jones and Pixie Lott. Hannah Verdier Inspector Montalbano 9pm, BBC Four The smooth Sicilian detective sets down his glass of inzolia and embarks on an investigation prompted by the discovery of a dusty war diary in a condemned bunker. No sooner has Montalbano started to delve into the book than a 90-year-old local man is found murdered. Are the two connected? MB Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories 9.35pm, ITV With some more guarded celebrities, Morgan\u2019s brash interview style can be oddly disarming, but how will it play with the ever-emoting Michael Barrymore? Barrymore certainly has an interesting tale to tell, from his time as king of the Saturday night shiny-floor show to his spectacular fall from grace. Ellen E Jones Film choice Untouchable, 12.05am, BBC Two Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano\u2019s seductive film survives its cliches thanks to the two charismatic leads: Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet is quadriplegic millionaire Philippe, who hires young west African Driss (Omar Sy) as his new carer. The irreverent Driss\u2019s effect on Philippe\u2019s stuffy household is hugely enjoyable. Paul Howlett Sport choice World Cup Cricket: England v Bangladesh, 10am, Sky Sports Cricket Cardiff is host to England\u2019s third group stage match. Tennis: French Open, 1.30pm, ITV4 The women\u2019s singles final at Roland Garros.
