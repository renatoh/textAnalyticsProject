Denmark needed him to perform in the World Cup play-off second leg against the Republic of Ireland \u2013 and how he answered the call. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder\u2019s sumptuous hat-trick in Dublin fired a 5-1 win, qualification to the finals in Russia next summer and a wave of superlatives \u2013 the most headline-grabbing of which was from his manager, Age Hareide, who described him as one of the top 10 players in the world. It is a measure of the pace of modern football, together with its wild extremes, that \u2013 seven days on and in the lead-up to Tottenham\u2019s Champions League Group H tie at Borussia Dortmund \u2013 Eriksen should talk of rather different emotions. The 2-0 defeat against Arsenal in the north London derby at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday has seen to that. Rather abruptly, he has felt the pedestal swept from underneath him. He is fired to prove himself once again. \u201cIt\u2019s probably good that we have a game so quickly after the derby and you can have a bit of revenge \u2013 you can show the world that you are a bit better than what you saw on Saturday,\u201d Eriksen said. \u201cWhen you get a knock on the head, you\u2019re going to lie down but we need to come back. \u201cGetting your country to the World Cup is something that you don\u2019t do often and it was very exciting. The game on Saturday was a big difference \u2013 a big blow compared to what happened last Tuesday. There was a high and a low and a big gap in between.\u201d Eriksen went to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as an 18-year-old prospect and he came on twice as a substitute; the second of his appearances was in the do-or-die final group game against Japan, when Denmark did not do and died. This time he will be the talisman of Hareide\u2019s team, the player who will shoulder the hopes of a nation. \u201cWhat the manager said after the Ireland game was a big compliment but talking to the media after a game like that \u2013 you put your players anywhere,\u201d Eriksen said, with a smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ve kicked on over the last few years as opposed to just the last 12 months. I\u2019ve shown more consistency. The whole Spurs team have shown incredible improvements.\u201d The barometers of the progress are numerous. This time last year Tottenham lost 2-1 at Monaco in their penultimate Champions League group phase tie to exit the competition. Now they have qualified for the last 16 after four games and the talk is about what it would mean if they were to top the section. Two seasons ago Tottenham came to Dortmund in the last 16 of the Europa League and, with an understrength team, they were beaten 3-0. That occasion feels as though it was taken from another era. It also felt instructive that Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team had been the pre-derby favourites on Saturday, even if they failed to live up to the billing. \u201cThe expectation now is that we win the Champions League and Premier League and I am happy with the pressure and the criticism,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt means people expect more of us. We know very well we have improved in every single aspect.\u201d Eriksen said: \u201cPeople looked at our group at the start with Real Madrid and Dortmund and said that we\u2019re going to have a tough time and end up in the Europa League. But we\u2019ve shown that we\u2019re better than that and we can compete in the Champions League.\u201d The criticism that has tracked Pochettino and his players centres on their away record against fellow members of the Premier League\u2019s big six. In 18 such fixtures under Pochettino, they have won only once. Although it is a different competition, they have the opportunity to show their mettle in Dortmund at one of the great venues of European football. Moreover, there is the thing about the trophies \u2013 or the lack of them. Some people insist that Pochettino needs to win one to validate his tenure. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve not won a trophy, I think when you consider where we\u2019ve come from, I definitely think we\u2019re on a positive way going forward,\u201d Eriksen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already more than proved a good signal about Spurs to everyone.\u201d Pochettino faces a selection dilemma against a Dortmund team that have drawn one and lost four of their last five Bundesliga matches and are all but out of the Champions League after a pair of draws against Apoel Nicosia. The manager, Peter Bosz, dropped the key striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, for Friday\u2019s defeat at Stuttgart for disciplinary reasons \u2013 he will return against Tottenham \u2013 and the overall impression is of a club in disarray. With qualification assured, Pochettino promised he would make \u201csome changes\u201d. Will he press Dele Alli and Harry Kane into the starting lineup, after both were brought back from injuries against Arsenal? Alli stands to come face-to-face with Clement Turpin, the referee who took charge of England\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Slovakia in September. That night the midfielder made the single-finger gesture that earned him an international ban and Fifa believed it was directed at Turpin. \u201cI will tell Dele to be careful \u2013 if he plays,\u201d Pochettino said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
