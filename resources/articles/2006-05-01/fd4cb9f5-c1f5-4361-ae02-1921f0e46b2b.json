More than 300,000 final year students face not having exams or coursework marked and some still do not know whether they will have any exams to sit because of industrial action. Yesterday the prospect of a settlement receded after the employers' association said there was no prospect of increasing its offer of a 12.6% increase over three years. \"This is at the very limits - and for some institutions beyond - what is affordable,\" Geoffrey Copland, chairman of the universities employers group Ucea said following yesterday's meeting. But the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, Sally Hunt, said: \"Yet again the employers have passed up a golden opportunity to bring this dispute to an end. At a point when they should have shown leadership they have let us all down.\" Yesterday the deadlock provoked students in Liverpool to stage a 200-strong protest. Carrying banners with images of pawns (\"Pawn. Student. Can you tell the difference?\") they began a protest march in the direction of the office of Liverpool's vice-chancellor, Drummond Bone. Nadia Harji, a student at the end of her degree course in English and French, said: \"I agree that lecturers should get more money - they work hard and deserve it. But their methods are wrong. We are the only thing they have to bargain with and we are being used.\" She added: \"I'm very sad and disappointed because Liverpool has been such a good experience.\" Academics' pay, which starts at \u00a325,000 for a researcher, has fallen behind other comparable professions, unions say. They claim the increased revenue from tuition fees means that vice-chancellors can afford to meet their claim for a 23% rise. Employers warn that an increased offer would lead to job losses. Yesterday Liverpool Guild president Irfan Zaman warned that whoever was to blame it was the students who were losing.\"Exams have been cancelled for final-year students. There are also students who will not get assessments and feedback from the final semester in time for graduation in July.\" Students warn that the disruption will cause widespread problems, particularly for overseas students whose visas expire this summer. \"Some think a degree based on assessments will not be worth the paper it's printed on,\" said Paul Freeman-Powell, halfway through a modern languages course. \"Employers will say, 'You may have a 2.1 but would you have got that if you had taken a final exam?'\" He complained that his own end of year assessments and exams have been messed about. \"I was sitting in my room with my dictionary trying to summarise an Italian passage in Italian. It was difficult and I was really struggling. And at the back of my mind was the thought that my work was going to be put in a drawer, forgotten about and never marked. \"You get your exam timetable a couple of months in advance and plan your revision. But suddenly that goes out of the window. Some exams are cancelled, some are back on. It's inexcusable. It seems as if they are punishing students by dragging us into this dispute.\" Rather than moan privately, Mr Freeman-Powell launched a website petition which has already attracted more than 3,500 signatures. He also helped organise yesterday's demo. \"We want to get the academics and the university's managers back around the table and talking.\" But Gillian Hoiwe, AUT representative and senior lecturer in Liverpool's department of philosophy, defended the action. \"The academic unions placed their claim last October to avoid this kind of disruption. We believe the universities have precipitated this crisis by refusing to negotiate until two weeks ago. Although we sympathise with students, we ask that the anger is directed at the universities and their negotiating body. \"We have been keeping a dialogue open with students. We have been talking at their general meetings and their council and been issuing statements. We are committed to our students.\" But, she added, resolve had stiffened since the university announced it would from next week start docking 30% off the pay of academics supporting boycott. None of the students waving their banners on Brownlow Hill yesterday expected the dispute to be settled before the exam season is over. And last night that impression seemed to be confirmed. \"Everything they [the employers] have tried in the last eight months, from ignoring our members to docking their pay, to lying about what we and MPs have said, has been designed to undermine a legitimate request for fair pay,\" said Sally Hunt. Geoffrey Copland, chairman of Ucea seemed equally adamant: \"Our members are clear they can not go beyond this offer - not a single voice [yesterday] suggested that more money was available.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
