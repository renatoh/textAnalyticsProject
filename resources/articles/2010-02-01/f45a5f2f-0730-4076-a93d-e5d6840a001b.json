Recognising their brand value as individuals, imports such as Eric Cantona are among the first to introduce the concept of separate image rights payments. Cantona also trademarked his shirt number and the phrase \"Ooh aah Cantona\". April 2000 Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp and David Platt win a test case against the Inland Revenue after it attempted to claim that a percentage of the image rights income that had been paid into offshore businesses established in the players' names constituted tax avoidance. February 2002 The term enters the lexicon of most fans when David Beckham's protracted contract negotiations with Manchester United are held up by image rights wrangles. More than a fifth of his eventual \u00a390,000-a-week deal comprises image rights payments. 2004 Inland Revenue begins looking into the issue of agents' payments, suspecting that some of the money is finding its way back to players as a tax-free bonus 2006 HMRC sets up a unit to look into the issue of image rights payments and begins investigating individual clubs, requiring them to justify each agreement. June 2009 To general incredulity, it emerges that Newcastle are paying Joey Barton \u00a3675,000 a year to license his image rights. September 2009 Newspapers report that HMRC is also investigating rugby union and rugby league clubs over the issue. It later reaches agreement with rugby union."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
