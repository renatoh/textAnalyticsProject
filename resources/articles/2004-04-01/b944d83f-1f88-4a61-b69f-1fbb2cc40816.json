Moreover, although they were facing sides at the other end of the table, they both took surprisingly long to gain the upper hand. Of the others, Millwall lost 4-0 at Coventry City (thus strengthening the view that their FA Cup Final date with Manchester United will have a detrimental effect on their promotion challenge); Reading went down 2-1 at home to Bradford City ; and West Ham were held to a goalless draw by Derby County - a result that prompted the Hammers' fans to boo them off the field at the end. It could have been the same story for West Brom, who, like West Ham, struggled to capitalise on their overall dominance, in their case against Gillingham . After taking what seemed an eternity to test the keeper, they should have made the breakthrough just before half-time. But Geoff Horsfield fired wide from six yards. The only goal came 11 minutes from the end, with Lee Hughes - whom West Brom's manager Gary Megson was thinking of replacing - converting a cross by the young substitute Lloyd Dyer at the far post. The win brought West Brom level with Norwich City at the top - on points - and put them eight points clear of their closest rivals, Sunderland. Ipswich achieved a more impressive scoreline at Rotherham United - 3-1 - but few can have envisaged this during a first half in which the home team went ahead through a superb goal by Chris Sedgwick and were running the show. Sedgwick's effort - following a stirring solo run - was cancelled out through an explosive 30-yard volley from Jermaine Wright; and in the last two minutes, Darren Bent and Shefki Kuqi delivered the knock-out blows. Bradford 's captain, David Wetherall, scored his first goal in more than two years to put his team ahead against Reading . The advantage lasted only 13 minutes, with Dave Kitson levelling the scores with an overhead kick - his fourth goal in five games. However, substitute Lewis Emanuel scored what proved the Bradford winner. Bradford's Michael Branch was shown the red card for diving, and Reading's Ivar Ingimarsson was sent off for appearing to strike Dean Windass. Of the other teams in the thick of the relegation battle, Burnley and Watford both collected maximum points, too, at the expense of Walsall and Crewe respectively. Crewe, a goal down, equalised with a Dean Ashton penalty awarded for Watford midfielder Lee Cook tripping Steve Jones. It was a needless foul by Cook, but he did make amends almost immediately by producing the cross that Crewe defender David Wright diverted into his own net. Ironically, Wimbledon , already condemned to the drop, produced the most stirring performance, a 3-3 draw against Preston North End after they had been behind 2-1 and then 3-2. Wayne Gray, who had put them 1-0 ahead, scored their equaliser. You can mail the Observer direct at sport@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
