Or you can use it to make your own squirty cream, by piling it into an icing bag with a tube star attachment and squirting it straight into your children\u2019s mouths. You\u2019ve never seen a quicker line-up than when offering this. Luckily, white chocolate has undergone a major rehabilitation in recent years. Rococo\u2019s Lemon and Poppyseed (70g, \u00a35.95) has an exquisite lemon zing and poppyseed crunch, if they could just ramp down the sugar. Its 32% Blonde (70g, \u00a35.95) version \u2013 where sugar isn\u2019t the first ingredient \u2013 is better. Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Mint White (100g, \u00a33.95) has the excitement of mint crystals and peppermint oil, which stops it being too cloying. My favourite, however, was Artisan du Chocolat\u2019s Creamy Mascarpone (45g, \u00a33.95), which is white chocolate with actual mascarpone cheese in it. This lends it a super-creamy taste that I went back for. But then something happened that blew my mind. Pump Street\u2019s 40% Brown Bread (70g, \u00a36.25). I was happily munching through it thinking it was regular milk, until I realised it is actually white chocolate in dark clothing: thanks to a touch of cocoa powder and brown bread crumbs. Now I don\u2019t know what to think. If all else fails, the baker Dan Lepard recommends adding melted white chocolate into tea cake-bakes to give a softer crumb. It works, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
