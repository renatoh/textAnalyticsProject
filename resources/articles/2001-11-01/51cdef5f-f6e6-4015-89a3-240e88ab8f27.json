For beaches, climate and wildlife, this vast and sparsely populated land, which has given us such exotic creatures as wombats, wallabies, kangaroos and Kylie, has no competitors. But its abiding strength as a holiday destination lies in its menu of contrasting, but strangely complimentary, landscapes. Parched, cinnamon-red deserts and fertile plains range with snow-clad ski slopes, terraced vineyards and World Heritage rainforest. A side-order of crisp, clean cities completes a memorable meal washed down with a vintage and all-encompassing seascape. Not surprisingly, the majority of the population live with 20km of the ocean.
