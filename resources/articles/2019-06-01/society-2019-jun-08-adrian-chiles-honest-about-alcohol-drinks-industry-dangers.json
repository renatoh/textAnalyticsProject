But the drinks industry hasn\u2019t", "bodyText": "I\u2019ve drunk more alcohol than is good for me all my life. Deep down, I knew it couldn\u2019t be doing me much good, but I kept my lips to the glass and my head in the sand and ploughed right on. Mea culpa. In the course of making a documentary called Drinkers Like Me last year, I found out just how much I was putting away, and what harm I\u2019d done myself. My liver, to my horror, turned out not to be in good shape. And my intake is almost certainly a factor in my trio of other middle-aged maladies: hypertension, reflux and anxiety/depression. Naturally enough, I look around for someone to blame other than myself, without much joy. But I have come to see that the alcohol producers really aren\u2019t being as straight as they could be. I still enjoy a drink and, although I have moderated, I probably still put away more than the recommended safe maximum of 14 units a week. I\u2019m not some nascent prohibitionist, by any stretch. People should be able to drink what they like, but they should do so with complete information. And that\u2019s something the industry seems intent on keeping from us. Consider a pub, with its long row of beer taps. On some you will see the percentage of alcohol in the beer. But why doesn\u2019t it tell you how many units of alcohol there are in a pint? For that matter, why doesn\u2019t it also tell you how many calories there are? After all, if you buy a bag of crisps for the beer to wash down, it has to have full nutritional information clearly marked on it. It turns out there is actually an exemption for alcohol products. If it\u2019s got alcohol in it, then there\u2019s no need to have the nutritional information on there. Therefore while there has to be clear information on soft drinks, there doesn\u2019t on alcoholic drinks. No, me neither. In 2016 our chief medical officers set the safe drinking guidelines at a new lower level \u2013 14 units a week for both men and women. Three years later, on the vast majority of products we looked at for Panorama, most producers still aren\u2019t seeing fit to mention this. Small wonder that fewer than one in five of us are aware of the crucial 14-unit figure, as it\u2019s on hardly any packaging at all. In most cases, the old advice \u2013 28 units for men and 21 for women \u2013 is all you\u2019ll get. As for the 14-unit weekly safe drinking guidance, for what it\u2019s worth \u2013 unlike many in the alcohol business \u2013 I choose to believe the conclusions of countless studies by scientists all over the world. If that\u2019s your long-term weekly intake, you have a 1-in-100 chance of dying from an alcohol-related illness. More than that and the odds get shorter. Regular drinkers everywhere scoff disbelievingly at these 14 miserable units. I used to myself, until I found out that more than 70% of all drinkers do indeed drink at that low level, and good on them. However, this astonishing truth does have an unintended consequence: most of the industry\u2019s profits have to come from the other 30% of us. We need to keep pretty hard at it for them. If we were all to drop our drinking to safe levels, those profits would be hit to the tune of well over \u00a310bn. I asked John Timothy, chief executive of the Portman Group, the industry-funded body formed to \u201cfoster a balanced understanding of alcohol-related issues\u201d, if the businesses he represents would be comfortable with losing profits. \u201cYes, demonstrably so. My members, alcohol producers, don\u2019t benefit from people who misuse alcohol,\u201d he said. Whether their shareholders are as relaxed at the prospect of falling profits is another question. The government betrays no appetite to regulate the industry. The secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock, declined to appear on our programme. He has said this year that he\u2019s \u201cdead against\u201d minimum unit pricing. For that reason England will soon be the only part of the country where someone with serious alcohol issues will be able to buy three litres of super-strong cider for less than four pounds. With alcohol-related deaths at a 20-year high, liver specialists are in despair. As eminent hepatologist Nick Sheron puts it: \u201cI\u2019ve been in this game for about 20 years. I\u2019ve been trying to stop people dying of liver disease by changing alcohol policy, and if I\u2019d thought 20 years ago that this is where we were I just would have been so depressed. We\u2019re just not winning. The drinks industry are winning because the government spends more time listening to the drinks industry than they do listening to doctors and the chief medical officer.\u201d One of the industry\u2019s arguments against minimum pricing is that moderate drinkers would be penalised. But as long as the minimum price is set at 50p \u2013 as it is in Scotland \u2013 you\u2019re still going to get a bottle of wine for \u00a34.50 or a bottle of whisky for \u00a314. If you\u2019re only drinking moderately, that\u2019s not going to hit you too hard. The alcohol companies need to chill out. We\u2019ll all be drinking quite enough to keep them ticking over for a good while yet. So they might as well start being honest about some of the numbers to get the likes of me off their backs.
