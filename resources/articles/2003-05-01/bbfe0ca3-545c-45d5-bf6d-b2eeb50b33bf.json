In making the manager's thank-you speeches nobody featured more prominently in Sir Alex Ferguson's tributes than the forward who, with a hat-trick against Everton on Sunday, would emulate Denis Law's 39-year record of scoring 46 goals in a season for Manchester United. The Dutchman's 79 goals from 100 games for the club is the most impressive goal ratio of any player to have appeared in a century of matches and just the one goal at Goodison would match his feat of scoring in eight league games in a row, a club record he took a share of last season - within six months of his arrival at Old Trafford - when he emulated Billy Whelan's achievement from 1947. He would then set his sights on making the record his own in the first game of next season and beyond that, Tom Phillipson's 13 in successive matches for Wolves in 1927. \"I wouldn't bet against Ruud in any situation,\" Ferguson said last night. While keeping most of his thoughts to himself, Ferguson is bemused that Van Nistelrooy's feats did not earn him the season's individual honours and what is the betting that, if the Professional Footballers' Association ordered a re-vote, Thierry Henry would find himself gazumped? Hypothetical, of course, but there is a sense of injustice at Old Trafford. \"I wouldn't put any store in that award,\" Sir Bobby Charlton, the United director and former striker, said. \"But I'd say Ruud has probably embarrassed a few of the players who didn't vote for him. He's played against the best defenders in the world this season and they've not been able to stop him.\" Ferguson concurs: \"It's voted for in December and it's too early to get an accurate reflection of the entire season.\" In fact the PFA sends out its voting forms in early February and they must be returned by the first week of April. Yet even so, the award was decided only one game into Van Nistelrooy's scoring sequence (13 in nine matches and counting), one which has established him as the favourite for the Premiership's golden boot. \"It's not possible to do it any later,\" said Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, yesterday. \"The Football League has closed now and players are going on holiday. It's true Van Nistelrooy has done brilliantly to come on so well, but we wouldn't want to diminish Thierry Henry's contribution by saying things could be any different.\" Van Nistelrooy's sympathisers, however, will suspect similar deadlines were also partly responsible for denying the Dutchman the football writers' award. Alternatively, the suspicion at Old Trafford is that as most sports journalists live in or near to London, they naturally vote for the players they see most. At Old Trafford they still wince about David Ginola, then of Tottenham, taking the honour in 1999 ahead of Dwight Yorke, the top scorer in United's treble-winning team. This, however, is not a time for what-ifs and besides, the championship winners' medal that Van Nistelrooy will receive on Saturday is of far more worth to a player who seems destined to be ranked alongside Law as United's greatest centre-forward. \"Ruud's form at the moment is fantastic,\" said Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the club's overall top scorer with 116 in all competitions. \"But it isn't all about goals with him because he can also create chances for himself and other people. He makes space for you and defenders are so obviously conscious of him.\" Their team-mate Gary Neville agreed: \"Ruud has been absolutely devastating over the last three or four weeks. If he carries on doing what he's been doing for the past two years over the next five or six then he's probably going to be the best centre-forward that Manchester United have ever had.\" And Charlton, who holds the club record with 199 league goals, 245 in total, was just as unequivocal. \"He's a natural scorer. There's Jimmy Greaves, Denis Law and you can add Ruud to that,\" he said. \"He's strong, fast, good in the air, right foot, left foot, lethal if you give him a yard. As soon as he gets an opportunity he puts it in, no pontificating about it. It's just instinctive. I'd say he was born to play this role.\" Most goals in a United season Denis Law 1963-64 46 goals, 40 appearances Ruud van Nistelrooy 2002-03 43 goals, 51 apps Dennis Viollet 1959-60 32 goals, 36 apps Tommy Taylor 1956-57 31 goals, 42 apps Brian McClair 1987-88 31 goals, 48 apps Dwight Yorke 1998-99 29 goals, 51 apps George Best 1967-68 28 goals, 41 apps Includes goals scored in all competitions"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
