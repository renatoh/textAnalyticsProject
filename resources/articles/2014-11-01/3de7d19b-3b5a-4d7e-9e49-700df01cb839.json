Pace, agility, height, strength, variety, class \u2026 they have it all. Unfortunately for Stuart Lancaster the men in question will be clad in gold. Somehow, between now and next September when Australia return for their crucial World Cup pool match against the host nation, England need to narrow the gap in attacking potency. Even Lancaster is conceding as much, making little attempt to spare the feelings of those who have featured over the past month. \u201cThat backline combination is going to be thought about a lot over the next six to 12 months, without a doubt,\u201d said the head coach, all too aware England are still hunting a midfield combination capable of giving the rest of the world sleepless nights. Some pieces of the familiar puzzle are starting to fall into place. George Ford will start at 10 against Australia and, injuries permitting, looks set to retain the fly-half jersey for the foreseeable future. That changes the dynamic at 12 and 13 in the short and longer terms. It increasingly looks as if the diminutive Kyle Eastmond, who started against New Zealand and South Africa, has had his chances. As and when Manu Tuilagi is fit, he will surely return at 13. Which makes this weekend a monumental one for Billy Twelvetrees. Assuming he starts on Saturday, as now appears likely, his chances of making the World Cup squad could well hinge on the subsequent 80 minutes. The Gloucester player has been discarded once following a costly loose pass that helped New Zealand wriggle off the hook at Dunedin in June. In that same game, though, he was outstanding for the first section as England took the game to the All Blacks despite Twelvetrees not having played for six weeks because of injury. At his best he offers the passing, kicking and running threat which England crave at 12, if not quite the ramrod defence of Owen Farrell. With Ford also keeping the opposition midfield guessing, it should help those outside him such as the lightning-quick Anthony Watson and Jonny May. Suddenly, with Tuilagi back in the frame and maybe even Sam Burgess as a bench candidate, England would have the makings of a backline capable of causing some damage, particularly if Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade keeps developing at his current rate. With Brad Barritt and Luther Burrell also candidates for the 13 jersey \u2013 with insufficient training time to reshuffle the entire XV it would make sense on Saturday to retain Barritt as defensive captain to neuter the Wallabies\u2019 midfield strength \u2013 an awful lot boils down to whether Twelvetrees can demonstrate the consistency that has hitherto been Farrell\u2019s great strength. Ideally, with fewer than 300 days to go until the World Cup kicks off, Lancaster would love not to be still guessing about such things. As things have turned out, he has no option. \u201cI still think we\u2019re learning about some players. In an ideal world you\u2019d be talking about players with 30-40 caps and you\u2019d have gone through all the ups and downs of introductions to international rugby. When you\u2019re dealing with guys who only have 10 caps or fewer you\u2019re always learning. We don\u2019t have the level of experience in our backline that other countries have.\u201d The good news is that in the 20-year-old Watson England have a genuine game-buster in the making. \u201cThe big step forward for me in the last two or three weeks has been those wing slots. Anthony has taken his opportunity really well \u2026 he\u2019s got all the physical attributes, he\u2019s athletic, he\u2019s quick, he\u2019s got good footwork and he\u2019s good in the air.\u201d All that was missing was the confidence to go with it. \u201cWhen we picked the EPS squad last month, he was selected behind Semesa Rokoduguni,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cThat rattled him because it was the first time in his career he hadn\u2019t been picked. That was the tipping point. He realised that if he wanted to be in this team he needed to have some presence and his personality had to come out. Now it has done. That\u2019s been the most pleasing bit.\u201d Victory on Saturday, though, is all that counts now. England would settle for a 3-0 win and a grinding forward-based performance; attractive defeats are no good to them. Lancaster saw enough in Australia\u2019s defeat against Ireland to suspect it will not be that easy. \u201cWe need to make sure we play the game in the right areas of the field, without a doubt. If you give the Australians too much loose ball before you know it they are running under the posts. Defensively it\u2019s going to be a big game for us. We\u2019ll definitely be in trouble if we play the way we did early on against Samoa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
