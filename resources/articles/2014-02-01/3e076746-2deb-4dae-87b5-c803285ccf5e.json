It needs to be amusing and it needs to have heart; its intentions collapse if you neither laugh nor feel. On the surface Babylon (Sunday, Channel 4) is a successful example of what a comedy-drama should be. It ticks off its primary requirements with astounding certainty. For 90 minutes, I laughed and I despaired. The concept is tricky to pin down, because it aims to do so much. It's a cop show, but its cops are also participating in the making of a cop show. It's a political satire, but it is warm towards its main targets while still managing to criticise the system that contains them. Its jagged, withering dialogue is often very funny, but it left me with a residual feeling of hopelessness, rather than good humour. I think this cocktail of reactions is a positive sign, and with the calibre of talent involved, that was almost inevitable. Danny Boyle, the man with big Hollywood films and an Olympic opening ceremony on his CV, directed this feature-length pilot (a six-part series is due to start filming in March). It's full of the requisite quick cuts and thumping beats and it moves at a whippet's pace. Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong, who did Peep Show, Fresh Meat and Four Lions, wrote the eviscerating script. There has been much talk of television becoming too Americanised in its hunt for quality, but this is a prime example of taking US TV's most appealing trait \u2013 its ambition \u2013 and applying it without compromise to a British sensibility. The large ensemble cast, telling the story of a spree shooting in London, is excellent throughout. James Nesbitt plays Chief Commissioner Richard Miller, in one of his best roles in years \u2013 Miller is hobbled by expectations yet sensible enough to recognise it. Chickens star Jonny Sweet, who plays one of Miller's hapless acolytes, nicks almost every scene he's in, while Bertie Carvel plays the odious deputy head of communications Finn as Alan B'Stard with a sense of machiavellian entitlement. He is deliciously repellent. The shootings take place on the same day that Liz Garvey (Another Earth's Brit Marling), a shiny American PR boss, has taken her post as head of comms for the Metropolitan police. She has been appointed on a platform of honesty and transparency, but the old, opaque system creaks into life around her while she desperately scrabbles for a way of presenting the truth. Honesty is a slippery concept for everyone here, and the closest the chief commissioner can get is a parroted repetition of: \"That is the current position based on the facts we have in front of us at the moment.\" The ensuing drama ricochets around various departments and bureaucratic black holes until it comes to a farcical climax, in which a house is stormed by armed officers, and the shooter is shot, though nobody wants to take responsibility for ordering the action \u2013 so nobody really does. Babylon had begun with a contained raid, in which a half-naked man and his dog got Tasered in the doorway of their home. It ended with a far bigger raid involving countless officers and top-ranking officials, and the conclusion was the same. All, Babylon seems to be saying, will end in pathetic chaos. The only dud note for me was the teeing up of a potential romance between Miller and Garvey, which was an extraneous bit of romantic fluff in an otherwise streamlined show. I can imagine, too, that some viewers may find it too knowing and too smart-arse. It's certainly self-aware: one of the TV producers within the show, who is making a Channel 5-ish documentary called Police Dogs, bemoans the bad attitude of his crew: \"It's very unappealing, this corrosive cynicism you guys have.\" But Babylon is not the vicious satire that some had anticipated. It's too funny, too human. Viewers are even led to empathise with the armed officer returned too quickly to duty after shooting an unarmed suspect, which is a brave thing to ask, given recent events. Its cynicism is, however, all the more corrosive for being subtle. It's less of a damning takedown of modern policing, more a resigned shrug that it is broken from top to bottom, and nobody has any idea how to fix it. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2014.
