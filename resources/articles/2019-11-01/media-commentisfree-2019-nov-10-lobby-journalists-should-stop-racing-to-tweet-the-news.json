Broadcast news and current affairs programmes are full of it. Newspaper front pages are devoted to it. Social media is humming with it. And there are still 31 days to go. How could it be otherwise? What is so fascinating this time around, quite apart from the obvious fact that so much hangs on the election\u2019s outcome, is the momentous and simultaneous change in both the political and the media landscapes. All the old certainties on both sides of the divide are over. Two-party parliamentary politics is long gone. National newsprint domination of the debate, if not entirely extinct, is on the endangered list. Although television still holds the central ground, viewing figures suggest it is gradually losing its audience appeal, especially among young voters. They prefer Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram. This double fragmentation, with multiparty politics trying to get messages across to the electorate through multiplatform media, is a particular challenge for mainstream journalists. Their response has been less than overwhelming. They appear to have learned nothing from detractors who complain about arrogance and partisan spin. Thousands of social media postings point to the supposed faults of the mainstream media, while people seem to revel in writing hostile below-the-line comments on newspaper websites. Do editors and reporters simply ignore them? Day after day, coverage in tabloids has been predictable and repetitive \u2013 self-serving, shrill and sometimes silly. A Sun headline on a story about a Labour frontbencher\u2019s exaggeration of the number of cancelled NHS operations, apart from being inexplicable, brought back memories of postwar Soviet paranoia: \u201cReds in op ed howler\u201d. The Daily Telegraph, the paper shaped like a broadsheet but with a tabloid agenda, has been risibly propagandist on behalf of its columnist Boris Johnson. Readers\u2019 letters would suggest it retains their support despite its hysterical coverage. Then again, it is losing readers at a faster rate than its rivals. Papers and news broadcasters were soon engaged in that most favoured of election campaign games known as \u201cgaffe-hunting\u201d. Trust Jacob Rees-Mogg to be first out of the starting gate with a crassly insensitive remark about Grenfell. A wealthy Old Etonian, who dresses and talks as if he has time-travelled from the 18th century, is a gift both to journalists and to Labour. Several other instances of supposed blunders followed. By far the most interesting, for several reasons, was the \u201cdoctoring\u201d of a video of a Piers Morgan interview with Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer. Shared on social media, it suggested that Starmer was lost for words when asked about his party\u2019s Brexit policy. Despite a claim by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, that it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead people, it was roundly denounced by a senior colleague, the defence minister Johnny Mercer. Whether true or not, it indicated the Tories are putting great store by social media content. The incident also revealed concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook\u2019s policing of false content. Its UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, maintained that the network would have allowed the Starmer video to have been used as a paid-for advert on the specious grounds that it had stimulated a \u201cferocious political debate\u201d. That view was not shared by the editor of the Yorkshire Post, James Mitchinson, who was outraged by the posting of the edited clip, contending that it was a \u201cdangerous\u201d stunt. He argued that politicians could not demand respect while deceiving the public. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s damaging to your trust levels and demeaning to the electorate.\u201d And where did Mitchinson make his comments? On Twitter, of course. It has become the go-to communications platform for journalists, including most national newspaper and broadcasting political editors. After lobby briefings and discreet conversations with their sources, they race to be first to tweet the news. It has become a new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless. Great sport for journalists and those inside the Westminster bubble but, really, what\u2019s the point in the wider world? It is surely time for editors to curb their journalists\u2019 Twitter enthusiasm. They are simply seeking bragging rights: look what I know that you don\u2019t. This showing off is embarrassing and surely counter-productive because it undermines their status. Nowhere is this more obvious than at the BBC. Its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, is wearing out her fingers with incessant tweeting. All too often, the result of her tweets, along with those of her rivals, such as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and Sky News\u2019s Beth Rigby, is to generate stories tangential to the central news agenda. In their haste to tweet they also fall into the trap of repeating briefings before they\u2019ve had the chance to feed them through their own journalistic filter. They overlook that famous journalistic dictum when dealing with politicians (and their special advisers): \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d Sometimes, they move into areas that call into question their commitment to impartiality. Last week, Rigby tweeted: \u201cIn a party where just one in five MPs are female, the roll call of talented women who\u2019ve just quit the Tories is alarming.\u201d She did preface her comment with the word \u201cViews\u201d, but she could face accusations of bias. She appears to have gone out on a limb that her competitors have wisely refused to follow. All, however, can be accused media narcissism. While impressing each other with their tweets, they do little to provide worthwhile information to the public. Finally, if you want to track a form of partisanship that becomes more and more evident by the day, count the number of times \u2013 on TV, on radio and in newspapers \u2013 the prime minister is referred to as Boris and his Labour rival as Jeremy. It\u2019s a no-contest victory for Johnson. Single name recognition gives a political leader a huge advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
