In 2004, he came from nowhere to win the Perrier Award with his breakthrough show Jackson's Way, a wildly funny spoof of motivational speaking. And then he went away again. Rather than capitalising on his initial success with some TV work or live tours, he went back to his roots in experimental theatre, continuing to create bold and brilliant shows that generate big laughs among the lucky few people that got to see them. But on the rare occasions that he pops his head above the comedy circuit parapet, he's well worth checking out. This week he's swapping his usual fringe theatre environs for a proper comedy club in the shape of London's Knock2Bag. Also on Friday's bill are multimedia experimenter William Andrews and noisily confrontational stand-up Nick Helm. Rich Mix, E1, Fri Rhod Gilbert: The Man With The Flaming Battenburg Tattoo, On tour He's got a penchant for quirky titles (his last tour was The Cat That Looked Like Nicholas Lyndhurst), but this time Welsh comedy titan Rhod Gilbert has gone beyond the call of duty in his search for inspiration. He himself is the man with the titular tattoo, and exactly what quirk of his mental makeup led to him having a cake inked on to his shoulder blade will be one of the subjects under discussion in this new show. Gilbert's deadpan, common-sense observational comedy \u2013 always delivered in an ultra-gravelly South Wales accent \u2013 has already carried him to TV stardom and the brink of proper A-list arena-sized fame. It's a prospect that seems unlikely to change him, given the ego-free matter-of-fact approach to life that powers so much of his humour. If there are to be stadium-sized comedians in this country, they couldn't come in a more appealing form than Rhod Gilbert. Bath Pavilion, Sat; Milton Keynes Theatre, Sun; The Lowry, Salford, Mon &amp; Tue; Liverpool Empire, Fri Scott Capurro's Position, London Unlike in the States, the UK hasn't managed to nail that comedians-as-talkshow hosts thing. Compared to Letterman and Jon Stewart, Graham Norton doesn't quite measure up. Showing us how it ought to be done is San Franciscan Scott Capurro, whose live chatshow returns for another run this week. As a stand-up, he's a devastatingly acerbic crowd-baiter, delighting in audience put-downs and brutally sexually explicit material. When dealing with interviewees, he dials down the bitchiness a bit, but there's always that delightful frisson of thinking that any moment the host's going to verbally flay the guests alive. Despite this, he's managed to assemble a very strong lineup of people to chat to. Joining him this week are Sarah Millican and Al Murray, plus campaigner Peter Tatchell, and the Guardian's own Yotam Ottolenghi and Hadley Freeman.
