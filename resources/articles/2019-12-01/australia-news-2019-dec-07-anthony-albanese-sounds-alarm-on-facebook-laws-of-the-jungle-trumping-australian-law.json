In a speech to a conference organised by a Labor thinktank, the Labor leader will recount a story about a men\u2019s rights activist who doctored a social media image from his Facebook page, co-opting it into a campaign against the family court. Albanese will say unless people had seen the original image \u201cthere is no way that you would know the image was a fake\u201d \u2013 with the fake image even containing an authorisation, which is a \u201cclear breach of Australia\u2019s electoral laws\u201d. \u201cWhen we raised this with Facebook, they shrugged,\u201d the Labor leader will say on Saturday. \u201cThey said it wasn\u2019t a breach of community guidelines.\u201d \u201cThis is a far-right candidate, creating a fake graphic fraudulently purporting to be from a progressive party, and Facebook sees no issue. Well I do. And it begs the question: if this doesn\u2019t breach community standards, then what does?\u201d \u201cAnd, perhaps more importantly \u2013 why do Facebook\u2019s laws of the jungle trump Australia\u2019s laws of the land? What then happens when platforms become so complacent with misinformation that they become unable to filter it out?\u201d Albanese will say the sophistication of artificial intelligence technologies means bad actors are now capable of doctoring video so effectively \u201cwe\u2019re unable to distinguish fake from real\u201d. He will warn these techniques are being honed \u201cas we edge closer to each election.\u201d \u201cMark Zuckerberg says he thinks people should be able to see what politicians are saying. But what happens when it turns out that what politicians are saying isn\u2019t real at all?\u201d Albanese\u2019s outing on Saturday is a broad-ranging reflection on the state of democracy, and is his third \u201cvision statement\u201d since taking the Labor leadership. As well as addressing the dangers of misinformation in democracies, Saturday\u2019s speech: Floats an option for parliamentarians to debate but not veto any decision for Australians to go to war, including examining changes that have been made in the United Kingdom, \u201cwhere there is now a higher parliamentary threshold for decisions to go to war\u201d. Proposes \u201can independent speaker whose loyalty is to the standing orders, not a political party\u201d and exploring the idea of a parliamentary integrity commissioner \u201cto align the conduct of our parliamentarians with community expectations\u201d. Renews Albanese\u2019s concern about the importance of breaking down echo chambers if progressives are to advance various causes, including climate action. \u201cWhat we need is a little less anger and a little less outrage. We could also do with a little less volume\u201d. The Labor leader will argue the volume of the culture war in Australia is currently crowding out the capacity for rational discussion. \u201cThe monotonous pattern of culture war arguments is now well established. If you disagree with someone, your facts are fake, your character is questioned, and you\u2019re denounced as an elite.\u201d \u201cOn the other side of the coin, if you\u2019re not progressive enough, you\u2019re cancelled.\u201d Albanese will argue debate has become so fierce and personal that \u201cpeople are subject to attack for putting their views, even if they\u2019re only 15 or 16 years old\u201d. \u201cI recently heard David Attenborough\u2019s right to speak about the destruction of the world\u2019s endangered species questioned because he flies the world to make his documentaries.\u201d \u201cQuestioning people\u2019s motives has now gotten so ridiculous that some of Australia\u2019s most experienced firefighters couldn\u2019t get the ear of their own government to warn of the dangers of this year\u2019s fire season \u2013 just because they accepted the reality of climate change.\u201d \u201cTime and again they tried. Time and again they were ignored. Even firefighters are now denounced as cultural elites. This has got to stop\u201d. But he says the flip side of this is progressives have to listen as well as talk if they are to change minds. \u201cI think those of us who advocate change need to understand the viewpoints of those who will feel insecure by that change. \u201cWe need to talk with people who disagree with us. Engage. Debate. Advance. We need to argue our case \u2013 every forum, every opportunity. Because politics in an echo chamber does nothing to advance a progressive agenda.\u201d Labor increasingly has been muscling up about misinformation on digital platforms, having been burned by a fake news campaign alleging Bill Shorten would introduce a death tax if he won the May election. At the same conference this weekend, the ALP president Wayne Swan will declare nothing can be off the table \u201cincluding breaking up the social media platforms where the concentration of their market power is damaging society\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
