If Micky Adams needed solace after watching the side he has been charged with lifting from the dreaded 92nd spot comprehensively beaten by the team who began the weekend in 91st, he could take it in the knowledge that the man in his position back in 1987 has a stand named in his honour. Those in the Johnny King Stand have seen good times and bad since King led Rovers to three successive play-off campaigns in the second tier in the mid 1990s, but the club\u2019s current predicament \u2013 duly beaten 2-0 at Oxford on Saturday \u2013 is comfortably their lowest ebb. Relegation from League One on the final day of last season meant Rob Edwards\u2019 side kicked off this campaign in the bottom division for the first time since 1988-89. Edwards, a first-time manager appointed in the summer after impressing in his coaching role at Exeter City, paid the price for a start where Rovers won just twice in 12 League Two games. Adams watched from the stands at the Kassam as Oxford ensured that record now reads two wins in 13. The Tranmere player-caretaker, Matt Gill, admitted that \u201cpeople should be concerned\u201d by Rovers\u2019 position but clearly has plenty of faith in the Adams rescue operation. \u201cThe change has been made and the new boss will know exactly how to deal with this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very experienced manager. There\u2019s loads of time left but obviously we need to turn things around as quickly as we can.\u201d Adams\u2019 record suggests that it is not blind faith. In his 18-year managerial career he has had six full seasons in the fourth tier and can boast an impressive 50% promotion strike rate: with Fulham in 1996-97, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in 2000\u201101 and most recently Port Vale in 2012-13. Tranmere\u2019s chairman, Mark Palios, felt the club needed \u201csomeone with a track record of success who understands the territory he will be operating in\u201d. There is no doubt that Adams fits those specifications. Saturday\u2019s defeat displayed both the potential in the squad he inherits and the fragility. For nearly half an hour Tranmere looked anything but a side destined for the Conference. Jason Koumas and Max Power were neat and tidy in central midfield, while George Donnelly and George Barker buzzed brightly on the wings. It took a superb save from Ryan Clarke in the Oxford goal to deny Power after a beautifully incisive move that was worthy of a much higher level. But all the vim and vigour, all the inventiveness and charm, disappeared once Tyrone Barnett had given the home side the lead after 28 minutes. The visitors\u2019 response was initially frazzled, panicky, then resigned and sluggish, and the only surprise was that it took United, who came into the game on the back of a 5-1 shellacking at Cambridge United, until the 73rd minute to double their advantage. Adams does not take official charge until Monday, with his first game Tuesday\u2019s home fixture against Mansfield. He was in the dressing room before the game and at half-time, though he could not prompt an immediate response from his new players. Clean slates all round might help. \u201cObviously all the lads know they need to impress the new boss,\u201d said Gill. \u201cThere\u2019s a line drawn under what\u2019s gone and it\u2019s an opportunity for everyone. The lads that haven\u2019t played, the lads that have been playing, everybody needs to do more and I\u2019m sure the new manager will get that out of us.\u201d Palios has insisted that he \u201cremains committed to the vision of playing free-flowing and skilful football\u201d, an ideal that, for all his qualities, has not necessarily applied to some of Adams\u2019 teams in the past. But while Palios can have his \u201cvision\u201d and continue to make improvements off the field (he has brought in \u201csome of the successful techniques that have seen our Olympic teams thrive in recent years\u201d to improve coaching at the club), a bit of on-pitch pragmatism might be what is required. The Micky Adams stand might be a long way off, but it will be enough for now if he can just give those on the Prenton Park terraces something to smile about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
