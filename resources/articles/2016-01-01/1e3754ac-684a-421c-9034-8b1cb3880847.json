So it\u2019s probably not the kind of town you would expect to find a gleaming new bookshop and arts centre stacked with works that include Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, studies on the philosophy of Hegel and the works of Mexican author Octavio Paz. Just as unlikely seeming are the store\u2019s stated goals: to promote peace and help restore the social fabric through books and music. The highbrow publishing house and book retailer Fondo de Cultura Ec\u00f3nomica (FCE) set up shop in the town this year as part of a government crime-prevention strategy pushed by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Skeptics have questioned the value of promoting literature in a region where rule of law is not enforced and basic services are patchy, but Socorro Venegas, FCE director for children and young people, argued that the arts can play an important role in any setting. \u201cSpeaking of a culture of peace is important in any place,\u201d she said. Set in a renovated railway station and surrounded by squatters living in old rail coaches, the FCE centre offers reading sessions for children and adults, dance classes and even mariachi lessons. It is an attempt to offer an alternative to the narco culture of Mexico\u2019s lawless hinterland: a way of life which can prove tempting for young people who see former classmates making easy money, cruising the streets in new trucks and getting the girls they want. \u201cNarco culture is what\u2019s imposed on people here. It influences how they think, their music, the way they dress themselves,\u201d said Uriel Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez, a teacher and poet leading a young writers\u2019 group at the centre. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to turn this culture around.\u201d On a recent afternoon at the centre, a group of a teenagers joined in a public reading session in a room full of couches and cushions and adorned with murals outlining events from Apatzing\u00e1n\u2019s history. Parents say the centre is having a positive impact, especially since teenagers find few outlets for entertainment other than drinking and cruising around the town plaza. \u201cI\u2019m buying books and my children now want to read them,\u201d says Yuritzia Pinz\u00f3n, a mother of two. \u201cIf I don\u2019t push something positive on them, someone will push something else \u2013 likely something bad.\u201d But nobody doubts the challenges that beset Apatzing\u00e1n, capital of a mountainous region known as Tierra Caliente, or the Hot Lands. This was for years the stronghold of criminal groups grown powerful on narcotics production, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion rackets so extensive that they claimed a cut of everything from tortilla sales to public toilet charges. Previous attempts at government intervention in the region have had mixed results: former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n started his militarized crackdown on the cartels in Tierra Caliente in 2006 with an operation against La Familia Michoacana. It failed to dislodge the narcos, although the group split in 2010, reforming as the Knights Templars, which combined a pseudo mystical ideology with cut-dathroat business instincts. Eventually the Knights Templars were driven from Apatzing\u00e1n in 2013 by civilian \u201cself-defence\u201d groups, prompting Pe\u00f1a Nieto to name a close confidant, Alfredo Castillo, as security commissioner for Michaoc\u00e1n. Castillo reined in the the vigilantes by throwing prominent leaders in prison and deputizing the rest, though many of those receiving badges were accused of having shady pasts. \u201cThey\u2019ve removed the main leaders \u2026 in moves that have more to do with politics than justice,\u201d said Father Andres Larios, a priest who lent spiritual and moral support to the first vigilante groups. Things have grown calmer, Larios conceded, but he cautioned that reports of kidnapping and extortion are again on the rise as smaller cartels emerge to take the place of the Knights Templars. All of which helps explain skeptical responses to the FCE centre. Gonzalo Zaragoza, former director of a local chamber of commerce questioned how cultural programmes could help \u2013 even in the long-term \u2013 in an area lacking educational and employment opportunities for young people and where \u201cthousands\u201d of businesses closed due to insecurity. \u201cThis is a white elephant,\u201d he said. Others point to low reading rates: Mexicans read just 2.94 books per year, according to the National Reading Survey. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how this idea of a \u2018cultural centre\u2019 will bring about any significant change in Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s peace levels,\u201d said Jorge Kawas, a security consultant. He sees more pressing issues in Michoac\u00e1n, including substandard education, corruption and \u201cpolitical dysfunction\u201d. But FCE officials insist they\u2019re seeing results. Participation is exceeding expectations. Men also started accompanying their wives to sessions for mothers and infants and now read to their children \u2013 important in an area with rampant machismo Venegas says. They\u2019re also calling for patience. \u201cWe might not change all of Apatzing\u00e1n,\u201d said Martha Luna, director of the FCE centre in Apatzing\u00e1n, \u201cbut we will change those we\u2019re working with.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 January 2016 to clarify the breadth of Octavio Paz\u2019s writing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
