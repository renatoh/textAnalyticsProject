It's crazy to even consider it. Uefa cannot put anyone at risk,\" Liverpool's manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez, below, said. \"The situation is very clear in my mind. I feel sad for the people over there because it's a terrible time for them but we have to put the security and safety of everyone involved before anything else and that means we cannot travel there. It would be impossible to concentrate on the game. \"Uefa needs to make a decision quickly because there will be lots of our supporters wanting to know what is happening.\" Liverpool are set to make an official representation to Uefa and ask for the game to be moved to a neutral country. Maccabi's president Jacob Shachar had already conceded that the tie cannot be staged in Haifa, the port having been hit regularly by rockets fired by Hizbullah from Lebanon. But he was quick to suggest the match, due to take place on August 22 or 23, could be staged at the Ramat Gan stadium in Tel Aviv. \"Our European games are usually played in Tel Aviv, so let's hope that things remain quiet there,\" he said, \"though we understand Liverpool's concerns.\" Those are clear with Tel Aviv only 90 miles south of the Lebanese border and placed on rocket alert two weeks ago. Uefa will discuss a venue with both clubs and is likely to make a decision on Wednesday. \"We are very concerned,\" Liverpool's chief executive Rick Parry added. \"We will be making our feelings known to Uefa and it is hard to see the conflict being resolved over the next couple of weeks. You worry at any time but the situation is clearly, from our perspective at least, particularly delicate. The second leg should be played at a neutral venue. There was suggestion from Uefa that, if it was to be moved it would be to either Holland or Slovenia. Obviously Maccabi want to play in Israel. That's understandable but we have to be conscious of any risk to players and supporters. We want a decision as soon as possible. We don't want uncertainty.\" Liverpool will play the first leg at Anfield, allowing them more time to reach a compromise over the second leg, though Uefa is treating the option to switch as very much a back-up plan. \"We've asked the Israeli FA to give us assurances concerning safety,\" said a Uefa spokesman, Rob Faulkner. \"We have serious concerns and we wouldn't go ahead if we didn't have those assurances. We have played with problems there before and also played games away from Israel. That is Plan B, a back-up plan.\" Yesterday's draw in Nyon prompted huge excitement at the Israeli club, who were denied a similar tie with Liverpool in 2001 after their former Wimbledon midfielder Walid Badir was found to have been ineligible after featuring in a qualifying game against the Finns, FC Haka. Arsenal look certain to begin their attempts to go one better than last season's runner-up place by facing Dinamo Zagreb, who hold a 4-1 lead over Ekranas of Lithuania heading into the second leg of their second round in Croatia. Hearts will meet AEK Athens in the third round should they progress, as expected, past Bosnia's champions Siroki Brijeg - Hearts lead 3-0 - and Cork City have huge incentive to overturn a 1-0 home defeat by Red Star Belgrade with the winners meeting Milan . Europeans blocking paths of British clubs Maccabi Haifa v Liverpool Beat an understrength Manchester United 3-0 in a group match in October 2002 but a repeat is unlikely. Won a third straight championship last season but have lost two key midfielders, including Idan Tal to Bolton. Reinforcements include Yaniv Katan, one of several Israel internationals, on loan from West Ham. The squad has three Brazilian players. Dinamo Zagreb v Arsenal Open their title defence today having signed the Germany defender Jens Nowotny. The squad also features one of Croatia's World Cup midfielders, Luka Modric. Brazilian-born striker Eduardo da Silva scored twice in Dinamo's 4-1 second qualifying round first-leg win at Ekranas of Lithuania to all but secure a tie against Arsenal. AEK Athens v Hearts Coached by the experienced Spaniard Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, whose previous clubs include Barcelona and Real Betis, with whom he won the Copa del Rey in 2005. Among the players at AEK are the former Middlesbrough midfielder Emerson and Traianos Dellas of Greece's Euro 2004-winning team. Draw highlights - third qualifying round Hearts/Siroki Brijeg v AEK Athens; AC Milan v Cork/Red Star Belgrade; Austria Vienna v Benfica; Ekranas/Dinamo Zagreb v Arsenal; Hamburg v Osasuna; Liverpool v Maccabi Haifa. Ties to be played on August 8-9 and 23-24"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
