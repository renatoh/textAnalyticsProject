Right now, it's worse than you think", "bodyText": "Things were looking up for Blake Volkan. The 33-year-old Turkish Russian immigrant had been delivering food on a bicycle in New York for five years, earning as little as $3.90 a trip on platforms like Caviar and Grubhub. Last year, he got married, quit delivery, and earned a handyman\u2019s certification before landing a subcontracting job doing repairs for a hotel. The pay was much better, and he noticed the difference in how people would treat him. \u201cDoing delivery, people treat me like a dog. But as a handyman? \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 smiling, \u2018How are you,\u2019 and everything.\u201d Then the coronavirus hit, and the hotel told Volkan not to come in any more. His wife was furloughed from her job. Volkan realized he needed to get back on the bike and fire up the old apps. \u201cI like my job, but at the moment I have to survive,\u201d he told me. Like Volkan, I am among tens of thousands of couriers in New York City, suddenly thrust to the frontlines of a deadly global pandemic. It was already a dangerous job \u2013 our injury rates run up to 44 times those of the average American job; seven of us were killed in New York in 2019 alone \u2013 and it has become far more dangerous now. We are called \u201cheroes\u201d and finally being acknowledged as \u201cessential\u201d, but the truth is this job was never the first choice for many of us. For me, this job is a supplement to freelance writing; I decided to stop doing deliveries when the first few coronavirus cases were confirmed in New York. But others don\u2019t have that option. While writing this piece I spoke to workers aged 18 to 58, many of whom are pressing on in spite of unsafe conditions. There are many first-time delivery workers, laid off from other jobs, learning how to use the apps. No one is making a ton of money, and everyone is nervous. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve been doing this work for a day or a half decade: platforms like Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash (which recently purchased Caviar from Square) consider us \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and we are therefore not entitled to health insurance, worker\u2019s compensation, much less basic support from a human being. When the outbreak began, the apps simply sent out emails that sounded copy-and-pasted from the CDC (\u201cStay home and wash your hands!\u201d). Now, apparently worried about losing market share, the apps have temporarily waived commission fees for restaurants and cut customers\u2019 delivery fees to zero. Yet they have offered no bonuses or hazard pay for workers \u2013 the assumption is that we are disposable. The farthest they have gone is to promise up to two weeks\u2019 pay if a worker presents proof of a Covid-19 diagnosis, something that is difficult to obtain even with obvious symptoms. Workers who have tried requesting payments say the process is a nightmare. In practice, our best hope is to be careful and pray. Volkan considers himself well prepared, thanks to an ample supply of face masks and gloves from his handyman work. But he is getting scared as he notices more and more couriers coughing and looking sick. Many don\u2019t have masks. Even with protective gear, delivering food to a locked-down city has become total chaos. Demand is surging from the millions of New Yorkers suddenly forced to stay home, yet restaurants are severely short-staffed. Recently, Volkan was assigned to pick up food from a trendy West Village eatery that had begun offering delivery during the lockdown. Upon arrival he saw dozens of couriers crowded together on the sidewalk, and inside, what appeared to be a single cook, struggling to handle hundreds of orders. Volkan waited an hour for the order before police came and ordered everyone to disperse. The restaurant canceled all the orders and Volkan was not paid. He just moved on. The apps have hyped up a new \u201cno-contact\u201d delivery option, which allows couriers to leave food in a building\u2019s lobby to encourage physical distancing. But not all customers abide by it, or appreciate it. After completing one no-contact delivery recently, Volkan said he received a call from the customer, cursing at him. \u201cHe screamed, \u2018You son of a bitch, do your job properly!\u2019 It was my first time getting that in five years.\u201d Usually, high demand means more orders, which for couriers means more earnings. But since the outbreak, Volkan has accepted multiple orders only to discover upon arriving that the requested restaurant was shuttered. With no way to cancel in-progress deliveries using his Caviar app, he has had to message a support agent to request the cancellation \u2013 a process which usually takes minutes, but during the pandemic has taken as long as four hours, preventing new orders from being sent in the meantime. Once, out of desperation, he rode his bike empty-handed to the customer\u2019s address and marked the order \u201cdelivered\u201d just so he could continue working. \u201cI called the customer; I\u2019m like, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not going to get your order. Please contact Caviar.\u201d Most worryingly, hygiene has proven surprisingly difficult. Despite the pandemic, restaurants have been refusing to allow couriers to wash their hands in the sink. To make do, Volkan traded some of his face masks with another delivery worker for some hand sanitizer the other worker had ordered through DoorDash. DoorDash charged the worker $5 for shipping (other workers have been charged $10-$40). \u201cThe bottles were so small,\u201d Volkan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap\u2026 but they want the five dollars. They got to make a profit off of everyone.\u201d I contacted Grubhub, Postmates, Square, and Doordash for comment but did not receive a response before publication. A spokesperson for Uber Eats acknowledged the virus was \u201cespecially concerning for people who drive and deliver with Uber. In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can.\u201d According to some estimates, on-demand food is set to be a $385bn industry by the end of this decade. Grubhub\u2019s stock has jumped nearly 33% since the announcement of New York City\u2019s lockdown; DoorDash has recently filed for an IPO, with a pre-pandemic valuation of $13bn. In a call with shareholders on 19 March \u2013 when two hundred people in the United States had died from the virus \u2013 Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dana Khosrowshahi, said the company\u2019s Eats business was growing and revealed Uber had a $10bn pile of unrestricted cash. \u201cIn any crisis, liquidity is key,\u201d he said. The day after the call, Uber\u2019s stock jumped 40%. That financial firepower has not been deployed for us. Instead, we are fed hazy rhetoric. According to Doordash, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d (until you want benefits; then you\u2019re an independent contractor). In a self-congratulatory blogpost last week, Uber announced \u201cincreasing earning opportunities for Uber Eats\u201d \u2013 rather than a pay increase, this turned out to simply be a new feature allowing Uber rideshare drivers to also deliver food. This isn\u2019t helpful. As the pandemic continues to worsen, it is a matter of certainty that delivery workers will get sick \u2013 and it\u2019s more than likely that some of us will die. At what point does it become too much? The companies bet that our individual precarity will motivate us to keep delivering until we land in the hospital; that we are not organized enough to stand up to them. But in the last week, gig workers for the grocery delivery service Instacart, as well as workers for Amazon and Whole Foods, have gone on strike to protest unacceptable working conditions. I am waiting for takeout couriers to do the same. Laws are coming around to our side: recently the New York court of appeals ruled Postmates workers should be considered employees for the purposes of unemployment benefits; a law in California signed last year, Assembly Bill 5, reclassifies gig workers as employees more generally, though it has not yet been implemented. The apps are fighting these efforts tooth-and-nail to protect their outsized profits. They should think about protecting their workers for a change. Until then, we\u2019ll have to make it on our own. Recently, to try and pad his income, Volkan told me he had started buying a few shares of gig-work companies\u2019 stocks. After all, this could be the closest he\u2019ll ever get to owning part of the industry he\u2019s given years of labor to. But would he buy Square or DoorDash? \u201cHell no,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cWhy? Because they don\u2019t care about us, that\u2019s why.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
