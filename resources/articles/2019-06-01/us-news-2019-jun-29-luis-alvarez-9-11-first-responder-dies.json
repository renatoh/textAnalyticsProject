He was 53. Earlier this month, Alvarez appeared in Washington with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, to plead with Congress to extend the compensation fund for victims of the terrorist attacks and first responders. He entered hospice care days later. \u201cWe went to Ground Zero, the Pentagon and Shanksville to help people first and then help their families bury someone or something,\u201d a gaunt Alvarez told the House judiciary committee in a hearing which generated national attention. \u201cYou made me come down here the day before my 69th round of chemo and I\u2019m going to make sure that you never forget to take care of the 9/11 responders.\u201d Alvarez was found to have colorectal cancer in 2016. He blamed his illness on three months spent in the rubble of the World Trade Center after the attacks in 2001. Eighteen years later, from his hospice bed, he kept giving media interviews, demanding Congress pass legislation to provide ongoing medical compensation for victims and first responders. \u201cWe were told the air was safe down there, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he told Fox News from his hospice bed, with one of his sons beside him. \u201cI\u2019m nobody special. I did what all the other guys did. And now we\u2019re paying the price for it.\u201d Alvarez said he got sick 16 years after his exposure to the dust and rubble at the Ground Zero site, and added: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more and more responders getting sick. And I want them to know that. Just because you\u2019re not sick now, doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t going to get sick. And you need to be covered.\u201d Earlier this year, after US officials said the 9/11 victims fund was running out of money, the federal government slashed by more than half payments to those sick or dying from toxins released during the attacks. Those who developed health issues or did not discover illnesses for some time saw even larger reductions in payouts for health benefits. More than 20,000 people have suffered or died from cancer, breathing problems and other ailments because of trauma inflicted on 9/11. \u201cWe did our job,\u201d Alvarez told Fox News. \u201cCongress has to do theirs.\u201d His death was announced on Saturday by New York\u2019s chief of detectives. Dermot Shea tweeted that Alvarez was \u201can inspiration, a warrior, a friend\u201d. New York police commissioner James O\u2019Neill tweeted: \u201cWe vow to never forget him or his legacy \u2013 which was, simply, to have others do what\u2019s right.\u201d The former police detective\u2019s stubborn advocacy, even in the last stages of his illness, and his constant focus on the others who might soon have to deal with illness and financial anxiety, drew praise and support from across the partisan divide. Among early tributes to Alvarez was one from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who called him \u201cselfless\u201d. \u201cWe must build a society,\u201d the Vermont senator wrote, \u201cwhere we take care of each other and treat heathcare as a human right.\u201d Alvarez\u2019s family said in a Facebook post he had touched many lives and asked: \u201cPlease remember his words, \u2018Please take care of yourselves and each other.\u2019\u201d Additional reporting by Sabrina Siddiqui"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
