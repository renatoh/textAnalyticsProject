Tatishvili lost 6-0, 6-1 against Maria Sakkari in 55 minutes in her first match on the tour since October 2017. The fine equates to the her entire first-round earnings. The Georgian-born American, who underwent a third bout of ankle surgery in early 2018, last played at a grand slam in Australia at the start of 2017. She used her protected ranking, which expires on 24 June, to enter the French Open but under grand slam rules the match referee has the right to fine a player entering under such a ranking who is not deemed fit enough to play. In recent years, rules have been changed to prevent players from entering the first round of a grand slam when injured or ill to collect the prize money. Under the new regulations, if a player pulls out beforehand, they share the first-round prize money with a lucky loser who takes their place rather than risk forfeiting their earnings. Should Tatishvili want to appeal, she would need to first pay the fine in full. She is yet to make any comment on the fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
