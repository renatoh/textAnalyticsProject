But these teams largely fired blanks. There was an awful lot of noise, but little damage. Port Vale have made a habit of tweaking the noses of their more illustrious Potteries neighbours in recent years and this play followed a familiar script. Stoke, roared on by more than 20,000 fans outnumbering the Vale support by 10-1 in the Second Division's biggest crowd of the season, were struggling until James O'Connor headed them into a 55th-minute lead. Just as their support was preparing to celebrate a derby victory Dave Brammer spoiled the party when he equalised nine minutes from time. It was the least Vale deserved yet if Tony Naylor had made more of two first-half chances Stoke's 13-game unbeaten run could have come to an abrupt end. Naylor, small and elusive, thrived on the lack of attention paid to him in the first half as Stoke's three centre-backs concentrated on Vale's giant Jamaican striker Onandi Lowe. It was an obsession that would have cost them dear had Naylor cashed in after twice going clear on Birkir Kristinsson. Stoke's Icelandic goalkeeper saved his side on the first occasion, and delayed Naylor long enough on the second to enable Brynjar Gunnarsson to complete the rescue mission. Naylor, though, made amends with the pass that put Brammer in to score with a sweetly struck right-foot shot from 15 yards. The City manager Gudjon Thordarson has blended together a cosmopolitan team of Anglo-Scandinavian-Irish extraction who deserve a bigger stage. But they are being held back by too many draws against teams, like Vale, prepared to roll their sleeves up. \"Vale worked harder than us from the start,\" Thordarson said. \"That's why we hardly had a kick for 15 minutes. Too many of our players thought others would do their job for them.\" Vale's manager Brian Horton was happy with the repeat of the 1-1 draw at Vale Park in September. \"Our midfield bossed the game and we were the slightly better side. Stoke have spent a lot of money on players and they are up there among the big clubs in this division. We have spent pennies by comparison, yet we matched them.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
