The groups have called for reform of the laws and greater substantive protection of freedom of speech in submissions to the Senate inquiry into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. The inquiry received more than 150 submissions, and many groups representing ethnic communities warned against repeal of the section that prohibits speech that offends, insults, humiliates or intimidates people based on race. George Williams, a constitutional law academic at the University of New South Wales, made a submission saying the wording of 18C was \u201coverbroad\u201d and proposed \u201ca more demanding standard such as to degrade, intimidate or incite hatred or contempt\u201d. But he warned that a focus on 18C neglected \u201ca much larger problem\u201d of a multitude of laws that \u201crepresent a more serious infringement of freedom of speech\u201d. Williams cited section 35P of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, which he said allowed journalists \u201cto be jailed for publishing material revealing misconduct by government agencies\u201d or the fact someone had been detained by Asio. The criminal code also allows the attorney general to ban and label an organisation a terrorist group merely for \u201cpraise\u201d of a terrorist group where that might lead another person to engage in a terrorist act. Amnesty International submitted that section 18C did not require amendment, and it was one of many submissions to note that defences were provided in section 18D that protected freedom of speech for statements made reasonably, in good faith and in the public interest. The inquiry should focus on other laws that \u201ccreate serious freedom of speech concerns\u201d, it said. Amnesty International said the Asio Act should be amended to introduce a public-interest defence for disclosing information to the public about special intelligence operations. It called for repeal of the secrecy provision of the Border Force Act, which makes it an offence punishable by two years in prison for immigration and border protection workers to release information without authorisation. Amnesty said the data retention law should be changed to require a law enforcement agency to obtain a warrant before accessing a person\u2019s metadata. It called for an independent review of national security laws, including the offence of \u201cadvocating terrorism\u201d, and the general secrecy offences in sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act, which effectively criminalise public-sector leaks. The Law Council of Australia said it had not arrived at a \u201csettled position\u201d on 18C but argued that the ban on organisations \u201cadvocating terrorism\u201d should be repealed. It said secrecy provisions in the Crimes Act and the Border Force Act should require that disclosure of commonwealth information did, or was reasonably likely to, or intended to cause harm to an identified essential public interest. The council said the government should consider expanding the class of people who could blow the whistle on conditions in immigration detention to all immigration workers. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents journalists, warned of \u201csignificant threats to free speech\u201d and described the terms of reference of the inquiry as \u201ctoo narrow\u201d. It highlighted \u201cthe use of defamation, contempt of court, and suppression orders to intimidate or muzzle legitimate reporting of matters in the public interest\u201d and the risk of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for journalists who breached the secrecy provision of the Asio Act. Many organisations supported retaining 18C on the basis it struck the right balance between freedom of expression and freedom from discrimination. These included the Victorian government, the Refugee Council, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Reconciliation Australia, the Australian Lawyers\u2019 Alliance, the Arab Council of Australia, and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. Relatively fewer organisations supported the wholesale repeal of 18C. These included the Institute of Public Affairs and the Australian Young Liberals. The Australian Human Rights Commission, which administers section 18C including investigating and conciliating complaints, backed calls for a more comprehensive inquiry into other freedom of speech issues. The AHRC submission was silent on how 18C itself might be reformed. The race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, has said there is \u201cno case\u201d to change 18C, in contrast to its president, Gillian Triggs, who has indicated she is open to reform, including replacing the terms \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d with \u201cvilify\u201d. Organisations that backed that compromise position included Monash University\u2019s Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, MEAA, and the Australian Industry Group. The AHRC rejected the suggestion in the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference that it had \u201ccalled for or solicited complaints\u201d in relation to a Bill Leak cartoon, saying it was fulfilling its statutory function of informing people of their right to complain. It backed procedural changes, including requiring a complainant to state and detail a fact that, if proved, could constitute unlawful discrimination, and preventing them from pursuing a complaint in court if the president terminated it for lacking substance. Williams advocated a \u201cmore holistic response\u201d, including a general protection of the right of freedom of speech in the law, such as a bill or charter of rights. Amnesty International called for a human rights act as the best way to achieve freedom of expression and balance it against other rights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
