Keith Parkinson, the deputy president of the South African Rugby Football Union, resigned yesterday, citing dissatisfaction at how the administration has been run since the change of leadership six months ago. He claimed his position was made untenable by leading Sarfu members taking unilateral decisions. The body that controls the professional game in South Africa, SA Rugby, claimed yesterday that agreement had been reached with the players over contracts and representation on the governing body, a claim disputed by the SA Rugby Players' Association. The association has given SA Rugby until tomorrow to settle, with the players threatening not to play in the final two Tri-Nations Tests if their demands are not met. Matfield has trained with the Blue Bulls this week, raising speculation that his departure from a training camp in Australia last week had more to do with an alleged contract dispute with SA Rugby than a knee injury. At least five All Blacks have been hit by a stomach bug before Saturday's match. Three other first-choice players have been ruled out because of injury. Saracens yesterday clinched a three-year sponsorship deal with the Man Group plc."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
