Consultants are highly trained senior doctors, many of them working in hospitals. Consultants are normally appointed in their early to mid-30s, having completed at least 15 years of medical training (including 10 years of service in the NHS as senior house officer and then specialist registrar). The UK has around 26,000 consultants, of which 20% are women. What is the consultant contract? The contract is the national framework that governs the working conditions and salary grades of consultants. It dates back to 1948, when then health secretary and architect of the NHS, Aneurin Bevan, created it as a way of attracting senior hospital doctors to join the nascent health service. The Department of Health drew up a new contract last year following negotiations with the British Medical Association (BMA), which consultants in England rejected by two to one. But the deal has just been renegotiated. Why does the government want a new contract? For decades politicians have wanted to renegotiate the consultant contract because in many ways it ran counter to the principles of the NHS. Bevan admitted that in drawing up the 1948 contract he had \"stuffed their [consultants'] mouths with gold\" That \"gold\" was an NHS salary; the right to continue private practice in NHS pay beds; and a lucrative merit bonus system (awarded in secret by doctors to each other). While this effectively \"bought off\" consultant opposition to the NHS, it also institutionalised a two-tier system of access (the rich could always pay to jump NHS waiting lists) and allowed unscrupulous consultants to artificially lengthen waiting lists in order to create a demand for their private work. Ministers hoped that the 2002 deal requiring doctors to do non-emergency work during evenings or weekends would drive down waiting lists and remove much of the demand for private treatment. Why was the contract not renegotiated before? The late Barbara Castle tried while health secretary in 1974 to phase out NHS pay beds but failed in the face of consultant industrial action. The Conservatives introduced \"job plans\" in 1990 to enable managers to keep track of consultants' private practice - but these had little effect and were often ignored. Why was the 2002 deal rejected? Consultants in Scotland and Wales accepted the deal that pledged to raise their NHS pay by 19% over three years. But no-voters in England believed that the proposed contract gave NHS managers \"unreasonable\" control over their working practices and would distort clinical priorities - forcing consultants to focus on cutting waiting lists at the expense of needier cases. The contract gave clear rules on private practice - consultants would not have been allowed to do private work during their NHS contracted hours. And pay rises would no longer be automatic - doctors would have to meet performance targets set out in agreed job plans. Critics said consultants were merely protecting outdated arrangements that allow some senior hospital doctors to protect lucrative private work at the expense of NHS patients. How did the no vote affect the BMA? The association's credibility - both in the eyes of ministers and the medical profession - was severely shaken. When the no vote was announced last October, the then consultants' leader Peter Hawker, who had described the contract as \"a good deal ... fair to consultants, and fair to the NHS\", resigned. His successor, Paul Miller, widely considered a maverick, took a more hardline approach with the government, which initially attempted to implement the rejected deal on a trust by trust basis. The dispute between consultants and the government was further inflamed by the former health secretary, Alan Milburn's insistence that there would be no further talks about the contract. The BMA responded by warning that 7,000 consultants would quit if ministers continued to refuse to renegotiate. It also threatened to sue Mr Milburn because many doctors are still working in excess of the legal limit of 48 hours a week in defiance of European employment law. It advised consultants to begin a work-to-rule against the unpaid overtime that is required by the NHS to meet the government's waiting-list targets. Why did the BMA recommend the 2002 deal? It offered consultants more money, and set down clear guidelines on how much time they should spend working for the NHS. After qualifying, consultants would - as of April 2003 - earn a minimum \u00a363,000, roughly \u00a310,000 more than at present. The maximum salary grades would have risen by \u00a317,000 to \u00a385,000. There would have been extra cash for on-call duties. The new contract also put a 40-hour limit on the basic consultant working week; the BMA had complained that most consultants were overworked - that they regularly put in a 50-hour week for the NHS. What can NHS consultants earn from private practice? Anything from a small fortune to pocket money, depending on speciality and predisposition. The average net annual private practice income for an NHS plastic surgeon is \u00a375,000 (1999 figures). Orthopaedic surgeons rake in an average of \u00a358,000 a year from private practice. The least lucrative speciality is pathology (\u00a37,572). The very top surgeons can earn upwards of \u00a3250,000 on top of their NHS work. How was the dispute resolved? The health secretary, John Reid, has agreed a compromise deal with the BMA. Under the revised contract, consultants will keep their right to treat private patients if they have first offered four hours' overtime to the NHS. Doctors will no longer be obliged to do non-emergency work during evenings or weekends. But to protect the interests of NHS patients, the deal now includes a requirement that all consultants would normally devote three-quarters of their time to direct patient care. How will all this affect patients? The revised contract explicitly makes clear that the NHS patient came first and that the NHS always had first call on a consultant's time. In theory, this would have lead to shorter waiting times for NHS patients, more \"face-to-face\" sessions with patients and an increase in the time consultants spend on clinical care. What was the doctors' response to the revised contract? The majority of hospital doctors supported it. On a turnout of about 62%, 60% of those in England voted for the revised contract. In Scotland, about 60% voted, with nearly 79% of those backing the deal. In Wales about 60% voted, with around 94% of those in favour. In Northern Ireland, about 60% voted with almost 84% of those in favour. What happens next? The BMA is sending guidance on the implementation of the new deal to all senior hospital doctors in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
