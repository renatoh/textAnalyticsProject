As a result, on 28 May 1961, David Astor's Observer published an article by Peter Benenson entitled \"The Forgotten Prisoners\" which became part of an \"Appeal For Amnesty\". Amnesty International was born. What began as an individual cri de coeur became an international movement working to protect anyone imprisoned for the expression of dissenting opinion. Eventually, Amnesty International would fight for victims of torture, raise public money for the wretched of the Earth through successive Secret Policeman's Balls, and challenge the kind of state crimes associated with the Cold War. Today, Amnesty champions women, children and oppressed minorities, fights torture, campaigns against the death penalty, defends prisoners of conscience and the rights of refugees, and calls oppressive regimes to account. Its inspiring vision is of a world in which every person enjoys the freedoms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amnesty began with a letter to the Observer in the age of ink-on-paper, but the role it has to play is every bit as critical in the digital age. While much of the UK was tweeting about the superinjunctions of Ryan Giggs, Amnesty-inspired tweets about Eynulla Fatullayev, editor of the Azerbaijan Daily newspaper, went viral around the world. Yesterday Fatullayev was given a special Amnesty award for his quiet heroism. Fatullayev has been beaten up, intimidated with death threats, and finallythrown in jail. He was dramatically freed last week, a release he attributed to Amnesty. Amnesty's history reminds us that the battle for free speech must be fought and won anew in every successive generation. After 50 years of service its power and its relevance are undimmed. To celebrate Amnesty International's 50th anniversary, the Guardian and the Observer have started a new online series. Every month we will publish news of an 'urgent action'; that is a current case of human rights abuse that Amnesty would like to draw wider attention to \u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2011. It originally referred, in its headline and concluding sentence, to Amnesty's \"60 years of service\". This has now been corrected"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
