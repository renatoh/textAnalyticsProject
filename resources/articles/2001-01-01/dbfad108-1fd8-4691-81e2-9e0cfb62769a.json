Alan and Judith Kilshaw from Buckley, North Wales, travelled to the US in November to buy the baby girls from California-based adoption agent Tina Johnson after the couple saw her advertisement on the internet. Mr Kilshaw has said adoption procedure in the UK is \"over-regulated\" and people are regarded as being \"unsuitable\" for \"silly reasons\". Felicity Collier, chief executive of the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF), said the case showed the need for international regulation of online adoption. The Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, which comes into force in January 2002, will improve the regulation of inter-country adoption. A spokeswoman for the National Assembly for Wales said \"The aim of this act is to deter incidents like this case and make them an offence. But it is too early to say whether this case would be illegal as the regulations have not been confirmed.\" She added that it was unclear whether the Kilshaws have acted illegally under current legislation, as the US is a \"designated country\" whose adoptions are recognised by UK law. \"It seems a court order was made to allow the Kilshaws to take the children out of the US but they have to return there in June for an adoption order hearing. If an adoption order is made, it will be recognised in this country.\" According to BAAF, the court order, apparently granted in Arkansas, means the Kilshaws do not have to be approved by the Home Office as having gone through UK assessment procedures. Deborah Cullen, BAAF legal consultant, said: \"The immigration people could say 'well this is a bit rum and we want to have some more checks done' but basically British law says that these people have been recognised as the children's parents. It is quite hard for the immigration authorities to say 'no, sorry'.\" The Liberal Democrats have called for a kitemark system for approved websites listing children available for adoption. Health spokesman Paul Burstow MP said: \"A kitemark system could make people more aware of the quality of adoption websites.\" Felicity Collier, chief executive of the BAAF, said: \"The language used to describe the desperate situation of the children on some of these websites is awful and may attract the attention of paedophiles.\" Welsh health minister Jane Hutt will be liaising with Flintshire social services - which cover the area where the Kilshaws live - to see what investigations will be taking place into the adoption. Keith McDonogh, director of children's services for Flintshire county council, said the council had started investigating the case and the children's welfare was its paramount concern."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
