Britain\u2019s youngest adults have suffered a slump in their discretionary spending power while people aged 65 and over have enjoyed a sharp 37% rise. The findings shatter the myth of millennials wasting their disposable income on fripperies. In its first ever national audit on the subject, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s new Intergenerational Centre concludes that compared with people the same age at the turn of the millennium, today\u2019s 18- to 29-year-olds are 7% poorer in real terms after paying rent, or if they can afford it, mortgage dues. Much of their spare cash goes on groceries, utilities and education \u2013 while baby boomers splash out more as a proportion on recreation, restaurants, hotels and culture. \u201cThe clear picture in terms of day-to-day living standards as measured through household consumption is of generational progress for older generations, and generational decline for younger ones,\u201d the report says. Claire Turner, a director at the Centre for Ageing Better, urged caution, blaming \u201cdecades of political short-termism and a failure by successive governments to respond to Britain\u2019s changing population structure\u201d. But a spokesman for Generation Rent said \u201cresentment is growing\u201d and the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation accused older people of \u201cbreaking the social contract\u201d. Angus Hanton said older voters allowed policies that have financially hobbled the young: \u201cWhen asked to ease the pressure on the intergenerational contract by contributing a little more if they have it, older generations demand intergenerational solidarity and universal benefits for their generation, but not for others.\u201d * * * Chancellor\u2019s lunge to stop Johnson \u2013 As Theresa May heads to the EU summit, Philip Hammond is staying back to launch a broadside at Boris Johnson who is today expected to become one of the final two Tory leadership candidates. Four people go into this morning\u2019s latest vote of MPs: Johnson, the favourite, followed by Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid. Wednesday saw Rory Stewart knocked out. After a YouGov poll of Conservative party members found they are willing to lose Scotland and Northern Ireland from the union and accept \u201csignificant\u201d economic damage to bring about Brexit, Hammond, the chancellor, is to say he will fight for an outcome that \u201cprotects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom\u201d. Johnson\u2019s backers are saying that in the final vote by party members they would prefer to face Hunt, rather than Gove, who triggered Johnson\u2019s exit from the 2016 leadership race. But they are being warned any tactical voting operation against Gove, like the one that eliminated Dominic Raab, would \u201cgo down very badly with Tory MPs and members\u201d. After Johnson failed on the BBC to guarantee Brexit by 31 October, members of the ERG group of hard Brexiter Tory MPs have warned the frontrunner that not sticking to the leave date will earn him the same fate as Theresa May, \u201conly a lot quicker\u201d. * * * Global heating devours glaciers \u2013 The Himalayas have lost more than a quarter of glacial ice lost over the last four decades, scientists have revealed. The rate of loss has doubled since the turn of the century, indicating a \u201cdevastating\u201d future for the region, upon which a billion people depend for regular water. The analysis shows 8bn tonnes of ice are being lost every year and not replaced by snow, with lower level glaciers shrinking in height by five metres annually. The study shows that only global heating caused by human activities can explain the heavy melting. It combined declassified US spy satellite images from the mid-1970s with modern satellite data to create the first detailed, four-decade record of ice along the 1,200-mile mountain chain. * * * Porn block on shelf \u2013 The UK\u2019s online pornography age checking regime is expected to be delayed indefinitely. It had been due to come into force on 15 July, but it is understood government officials failed to notify the European commission of key details. Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, is expected to give a statement on the issue in the House of Commons this morning. The block, which would require users to provide proof they are over 18, was due to be one of the first of its kind anywhere in the democratic world. But it has come under repeated attack from privacy campaigners who have raised fears it would be possible to connect an individual\u2019s browsing habits to their identity, which could then be exposed in a data leak. * * * Bus stop attack \u2013 Four members of a girl gang who inflicted a \u201csustained and horrific\u201d bus stop attack on a frightened Egyptian student who later died have been given non-custodial sentences. Mariam Moustafa, 18, had a stroke and went into a coma after being slammed against a bus shelter on 20 February 2018. She died the following month. After admitting affray, Rochelle Dobbin and Netesha Lewis, both 18, and two 16-year-old girls were handed referral orders by a district judge at Nottingham youth court on Wednesday. The district judge condemned the teenagers as \u201caggressive\u201d but said the court would only jail young people as a last resort. Six people in all were charged, and two women had already been sentenced: Mariah Fraser, 20, was ordered to spend eight months in a young offender institution, while Britania Hunter was given a 12-month community order and 40 hours\u2019 unpaid work. * * * Breath of fresh air \u2013 London is to hold a car-free day on 22 September, billed as its biggest such event to date. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, has announced plans to close 12.3 miles of roads in the city centre, including around London Bridge, Tower Bridge and much of the City of London. Boroughs across the city will hold events promoting walking, cycling and public transport, as well as creating scores of \u201cplay streets\u201d. The capital\u2019s illegal air pollution levels kill thousands of people each year and blight the health of at least 400,000 children. More than 50% of London\u2019s toxic air pollution is caused by vehicles. Today in Focus podcast: Footballers who sued the boss The Women\u2019s World Cup favourites, the US, are taking on their governing body in a gender equality lawsuit that could have huge implications for women\u2019s sport. Plus: Jonathan Freedland on Donald Trump\u2019s economic record. Lunchtime read: Are slavery tomatoes on your plate? In the Italian south, the lives of foreign agricultural labourers are so cheap that many NGOs have described their conditions as a modern form of slavery. Desperate for work, these labourers will accept any job in the fields even if the wages are far below, and the hours far above, union standards. Italy\u2019s agricultural sector is booming, with the tomato industry alone worth \u00a32.8bn. Mass immigration is chaotic and uncontrolled, the exploitation of immigrant workers is systematic \u2013 and the produce they pick regularly ends up on the shelves of Italian and international supermarkets, bought by consumers who have no idea of the suffering involved. Today\u2019s lunchtime read is by Tobias Jones and Ayo Awokoya. Sport Phil Neville looked forward to the \u201cbusiness end\u201d of the Women\u2019s World Cup after watching his side defeat Japan 2-0 to reach the knockout stages as group winners. But while England can look forward Scotland can look only back with regret after they were knocked out in dramatic circumstances in their final Group D game. There are some 20 Cricket World Cup group games still to run but after New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson produced an epic unbeaten 106 to overcome South Africa in a tense finale at Edgbaston, the identity of the four semi-finalists is already taking shape. Eoin Morgan claimed his six-hitting spree against Afghanistan went beyond his wildest dreams but, for Joe Root, who watched all but one of the 17 record-breaking blows from the non-striker\u2019s end, the captain\u2019s assault came as no surprise. Global rugby union is braced for fresh turmoil after the governing body announced it had discontinued plans to introduce a Nations Championship for the leading Test nations. And Feliciano L\u00f3pez sought to restore some injured pride on Wednesday when he denied any suggestion that he and his regular doubles partner, Marc L\u00f3pez, had been involved in an alleged betting scam at Wimbledon in 2017. Business The strong hints by the US Federal Reserve that it will begin cutting rates next month to head off growing global and domestic economic risks have encouraged investors to bid up stock markets in Asia overnight. They were following the increasingly optimistic mood on Wall Street where stock prices are near an all-time high. Futures trading suggests the FTSE100 will rise 0.4% at the opening this morning. The Fed\u2019s words pushed down the US dollar and yields on US 10-year bonds sank below 2%. The moves helped the pound lift a bit to $1.268 and \u20ac1.125. The papers The battle for the Tory leadership and Tuesday\u2019s BBC debate dominate the front pages today, and the adjectives are out in force. \u201cBiased Brazen Contemptible\u201d screams the Mail, complaining that leadership hopefuls were subjected to a \u201cdisgraceful debate\u201d involving \u201cnakedly anti-Tory\u201d guests. The Express sings a similar tune with \u201cStorm over Tory TV debate\u201d. The fight to be the next leader of the Conservative party, and the country, features heavily in other papers. The Times predicts \u201cJavid \u2018wants to be the next chancellor\u2019\u201d, while the i leads with \u201cGove momentum builds but Tories fear dirty tricks.\u201d The Telegraph is also worried about the chances of the environment minister: \u201cJohnson hatches plot to knock out Gove\u201d. The Guardian splashes on the ramifications of the end of an insurgent campaign: \u201cStewart exists Tory leadership race as Johnson pushes further ahead\u201d. Away from the Tory party maelstrom, the FT leads on the Fed holding rates steady, while the Mirror is outraged about an NHS hospital charging \u201c\u00a318k for hip op\u201d.
