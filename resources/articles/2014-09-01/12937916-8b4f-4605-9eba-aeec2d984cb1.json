The Strange Library, which was published in Japanese in 2008, will feature specially designed text and illustrations when it is released in English for the first time on 2 December 2014, translated from the Japanese by Ted Goossen. The tale recounts a schoolboy\u2019s visit to the library which takes a number of very unexpected turns. On his way home from school, the young narrator finds himself wondering how taxes were collected in the Ottoman Empire. He pops into the local library to see if it has a book on the subject. He is then led by an old man to a special \u201creading room\u201d in a maze under the library, where he finds himself imprisoned with only a \u201csheep man\u201d, who makes excellent doughnuts, and a girl who can talk with her hands. His mother will be worrying why he hasn\u2019t returned in time for dinner and the old man seems to have an appetite for eating small boys\u2019 brains. Liz Foley, publishing director at Harvill Secker, said: \u201cWe are very excited to be publishing a special illustrated edition of The Strange Library as an unusual gift book for Christmas. Murakami\u2019s imagination is unique and this is a wonderfully creepy tale that is sure to delight his fans\u201d. The publication of The Strange Library follows Murakami\u2019s first visit to the UK in 10 years for the launch of Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage in August. Bookshops across the country held midnight openings and special events to mark the occasion and the book\u2019s front cover was projected on London landmarks including the Tate Modern in a countdown to publication day. Murakami appeared at two sell-out events at the Edinburgh international book festival, and in London on Saturday hundreds queued overnight to attend a public signing at Waterstones Piccadilly. The announcement resolves a small mystery for readers who attended the London event. At the signing, pastiche library cards were distributed featuring the words #strangelibrary, and what now transpires as the book\u2019s publication date. That solved, they can now begin to interpret the doughnut and sheep symbolism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
