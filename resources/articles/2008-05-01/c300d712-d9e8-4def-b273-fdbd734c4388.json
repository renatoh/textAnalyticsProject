According to the survey by the Post Office, which looked at 10 world cities, the Polish capital was judged cheapest for a three-day trip visiting museums, galleries and heritage sites. The cultural highlights of Warsaw include the Palace of Culture and Science - Poland's tallest building and a towering example of Stalinist architecture - and the Polish National Opera. Helen Warburton, the head of Post Office travel services, said that while museums and galleries were a staple of city breaks, this had now extended to booking the opera, ballet and concerts. \"We based our report on the idea that culture vultures will want to pack in two gallery visits a day and spend evenings out at music-based events,\" she said. A three-day visit to Warsaw would cost around \u00a375. By contrast, a cultural visit to London - the most expensive city in the survey - would cost around \u00a3308, despite many free attractions including the Tate Modern and the Natural History Museum. Other comparisons included a visit to the Royal Opera House (\u00a3137) and Warsaw's Polish National Opera (\u00a324). Jurek Juczkowicz, a sculptor whose work includes a monument in Warsaw's Krasinski Square, said: \"Warsaw isn't big like Paris and London but I think it's dynamite. It was rebuilt from the beginning and from nothing came a city. It's still creating and wanting to be a city.\" According to Visit London, the number of visitors staying in the UK capital fell 8% in 2007 to 10.1 million. Jamie Talmage, a business analyst for Visit London, said: \"The long-term trend is that it's easier and cheaper for people to go abroad, with a big push from the low-cost airlines. On the plus side the day trip market in London is quite buoyant. Theatres are doing tremendously well and it seems more and more people are travelling down for the day.\" Among the other cities in the survey New York was the second most expensive, where a visit would set you back around \u00a3260. It is closely followed by Barcelona for \u00a3259. However, travellers could take advantage of favourable exchange rate between the sterling and the dollar. \"Art lovers who want to benefit from the favourable US dollar exchange rate can halve their costs by substituting New York for Washington DC, which boasts the Smithsonian museums as well as the White House,\" Warburton said. Cheaper destinations were Lisbon and Amsterdam - but with a ticket price of \u00a310.40, the Van Gogh Museum took the award for most expensive art gallery.
