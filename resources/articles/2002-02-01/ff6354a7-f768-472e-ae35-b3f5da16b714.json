The Merseyside club have taken over the Frenchman's \u00a340,000-a-week contract in an attempt to stave off the threat of demotion from the Premiership. Ginola, 35, will make his debut in tomorrow's game against Arsenal with Everton, three points above the bottom three, hoping he is worth it. \"This move feels like a new lease of life for me,\" the former France international said. \"I was in danger of going a bit stale in the reserves at Villa Park but now I have the chance to play Premiership football again, which for me is the best league in the world.\" Ginola, a free transfer, was joined at Goodison Park yesterday by the Republic of Ireland midfielder Lee Carsley, who signed from Coventry for \u00a31.95m on a 4-year contract. He might seem a more obvious choice to beef up a squad struggling against the drop than Ginola, but the Everton manager Walter Smith boasted only 15 fit players this week, prompting a scramble to complete both transfers before the deadline. Smith said. \"He'll be leaving us at the end of the season but will provide us with options until then. It's only a gamble, given that he hasn't played a lot of football, but he'll get games here.\" Having been signed from Tottenham, Ginola made only 19 starts for Villa. He was dropped from the side after a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool 13 months ago and later threatened to sue the then manager John Gregory over comments about his physique. He was sent off in his last appearance for the club in December and fined for abusing the fourth official as he left the field. Villa's manager, Graham Taylor, said: \"I've been aware of negotiations going on but I had to let things ride. I would have liked the opportunity to have managed him.\" Ginola promised to \"give 100%\" for his new club, adding: \"The club's first priority is to guarantee their Premiership status this season and I hope the prospect of Ginola and Gazza excites them as much as it does me.\" Having lost Ginola, Taylor fears another talent, Villa's record \u00a39.5m signing Juan Pablo Angel, may also quit. The Colombian striker has overcome last season's inauspicious start on the pitch by scoring 10 Premiership goals in this campaign. But he is still scarred by his first few weeks in England. \"I would not have wished them on anyone,\" Taylor said. \"His wife had a life-threatening illness and his young son had a serious viral complaint as well. He was in a foreign country and could not speak the language - it must have been terrible for them.\" He almost went home once when his hotel room had not been rebooked, but was persuaded to stay by Gregory. Taylor feels he may not be so successful and said: \"There are problems and I've got a lot of ground to make up on behalf of the club.\" \u00b7 West Ham's Trevor Sinclair has withdrawn his transfer request. The 28-year-old had wanted to better his England prospects with a move, but said yesterday he \"couldn't be happier\" at Upton Park. \u00b7 Bolton have been told by their local authority that part of the Reebok stadium could be closed because of persistent standing by fans during the game against Manchester United last week. \u00b7 Celtic's manager Martin O'Neill has admitted that finding a six-foot Union flag in his front garden after his side's midweek CIS Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers had been \"disconcerting\" for his family. \u00b7 Portsmouth have taken Mallorca's Argentine striker Leonardo Biagini, 24, on loan and First Division rivals Birmingham have signed Nottingham Forest striker Stern John, 25, for \u00a3100,000. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
