Joe Hockey's first federal budget contained a \"very ominous\" message for ABC audiences in foreshadowing that the 1% cut to ABC funding for the next four years was just a \"down payment\" and there there would be more cuts to come. \"You can't absorb big funding cuts without cutting back on staff, cutting back on services and cutting back on the new initiatives the ABC has launched,\" Scott said. The cuts contradict promises made by prime minister Tony Abbott during last year's election campaign not to cut the ABC's budget. Scott said the ABC's digital initiatives such as iView, ABC News 24 and triplej Unearthed were all funded by internal efficiencies and if the government stripped away its ability to fund new services the ABC's future as an innovator would be stunted. In a message to staff Scott said: \"At this very early stage... it is clear that some jobs will inevitably be lost and some services affected. It is impossible for the ABC to operate as before given the scale of the cuts and the likelihood of more to come.\" In interviews on ABC radio and television Scott accused the government of failing to consult with him on the decision to axe the Australia Network just one year into a 10-year contract. He stopped short of blaming a concerted campaign by News Corp and Sky News Australia to axe the Australia Network, but he said he now believed the decision had been made a very long time ago and without any real consultation. While other countries around the world were expanding their international broadcasting services \"as key instruments of public diplomacy\", Australia was shutting its broadcaster down and it made no sense he said. Scott told staff that there was a \"clear election commitment to maintain ABC funding\" but now the government would reduce operational funding by $9 million in 2014-15 and subsequent years; withdraw funding for the Australia Network and extract further savings from the ABC over the next few years flowing from the efficiency review. \"The impact on the ABC budget from the first two measures alone amounts to approximately $120 million over the next four years \u2013 a big imposition on an organisation of our size,\" he said. \"The Budget makes it clear that the $9 million operational cut is a \u201cdown payment\u201d on savings to be factored into future budgets as a result of the Lewis Review. No indication has been given about the size of these savings commitments. \"The ABC has always acknowledged the need for financial discipline, especially in a climate of budget austerity, and has acted accordingly. \"The ABC Board and ABC Executive will meet over the next few weeks to assess the impact of these decisions and the prospect of future cuts. \"We will need to adjust our internal budgets and to manage the complexities of the AN decision. We will carefully review our services and strategies. As we do this, we will consult and keep staff informed of our decisions and their consequences.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
