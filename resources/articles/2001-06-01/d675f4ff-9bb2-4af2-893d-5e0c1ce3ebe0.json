Stockbroker Matthew Harragin, the co-head of the Bristol-based Rathbones Ethical Investment Team describes a recent week in his life. Monday To ABN Amro's seminar on the environment. Mike Averill, the chief executive of the waste company, Shanks, said he was sceptical about government plans to build 40 waste incinerators, as they cost \u00a3100m to build and obtaining planning permission can take two years. I decide these problems will boost recycling companies. At a presentation for Tomra, a Norwegian manufacturer of reverse vending machines, I saw their strategy - to be \"the world's number one provider of solutions that make it attractive for people to return packaging for re-use and recycling\". Norway and Sweden have mandatory deposits on both bottles and cans. The German government is currently debating whether to bring this in in Germany. If it decides to follow suit, Tomra's share price should rocket. The seminar showed there were no British firms involved in wind farms. The most exciting in this field was Gamesa, a wind turbine manufacturer from Spain - the second most important country for wind power in the world. The company looked interesting but had an aeronautical division, so I shall have to to check for any military involvement which would be a turn-off. Tuesday Our weekly investment meeting. Luke Hickmore, our fund manager, proposed reducing conventional oil holdings such as BP and reinvesting in alternative energy holdings such as Ballard Power and Johnson Matthey (fuel cells) and Vestas (wind turbines). I suggested Gamesa and a colleague confirmed that they had no military involvement. Wednesday I sign up for a business and sustainability course at Schumacher College in Devon, run by Hazel Henderson, of the Calvert Social Investment Fund and the New Economics Foundation. She has just published the Calvert Henderson quality of life indicators, which aim to go beyond narrow economic measure ment and find \"blind spots\" One area is so-called \"free goods\" - air and water - which need to be fully costed. Thursday Beyond Petroleum day - aka the BP AGM. Greenpeace were promoting special resolution 18, asking BP to set out by December 2001 their strategy for reducing and phasing out the production and sale of fossil fuels in response to climate change. This resolution only carried 7.44% of the vote, but given the size of the BP share register, this sent an important signal to the BP board. If a company takes on an emotive mantra like \"Beyond Petroleum\" one would expect some serious investment in alternative energy, such as $1bn - 6% of pre-tax profits. Any less would smack smacks of greenwash. More and more of our clients expect us to engage with companies over their global responsibilities. In the case of GlaxoSmithKline we questioned the company on their rationale behind taking the South African government to court over using generic drugs to combat Aids. Glaxo later dropped the court case. We have quizzed Cadburys on the so-called cocoa slaves. They say their main source of cocoa is Ghana, which does not have the same sort of exploitation problems as the Ivory Coast. Our clients feel that Cadburys should be doing more. As a former cocoa trader, I agree. Friday Friday is a research day when I go through company reports and accounts. I particularly like the Pearson report . It'sthe only FTSE company with a female chief executive, and her review is inspiring. Increasingly, company annual reports include sections on community and the environment. Some are producing separate environmental impact reports. If companies were more transparent, particularly with regard to their future direction, then AGMs would be less fraught. We certainly prefer to support the companies we invest in rather than bashing them. \u0095 The Calvert Henderson quality of life indicators are published by Calvert Group, 4550 Montgomery Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA Matthew Harragin has donated his fee for this article to Schumacher College, Totnes, Devon, TQ9 6EA. The college promotes human scale sustainable development in the UK and abroad. All that's green isn't golden Few companies looked set to benefit from socially responsible investment as successfully as Iceland Foods. As it expanded, it added ethical dimensions, promising to link efficiency with social conscience and profitability with good business ethics. But green credentials are not enough. Ethical investors such as Rathbones have sold following a disastrous expansion. It had done everything right from cancelling an order for Norwegian prawns as a protest against Norway's whale fishing, involvement in local communities, the \"Food You Can Trust\" label as a response to the BSE crisis, espousing organics, and its refusal to stock genetically modified (GM) food. But then came the turning point. In May 2000, Iceland announced it was merging with Booker, Britain's largest cash and carry operation. Despite its commercial potential, the deal was not universally welcomed by the City. An additional dilemma for ethical investors was the fact that over 25% of group turnover would come from tobacco sales. It cut back on cigarette sales - but not far enough. Then executives were in and out on revolving doors, leading to a backtrack on the green stance which had not anyway chimed with the firm's often downmarket customer base. But the right company at the right time may still manage to deliver the dream of food retailing with a conscience. And that company may yet prove to be Iceland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
