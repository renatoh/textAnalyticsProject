Or dropped your phone on your nose while texting in bed. If so, you are not alone \u2013 a study shows that mobile-related injuries are increasing. The research, which analyses data from US emergency departments over 20 years, shows the number of accidents has soared in recent years. Young people are most likely to sustain a phone-related injury, with 13- to 29-year-olds reporting the highest number of accidents. The majority of injuries were the result of people becoming distracted while engaging in other activities, such as texting while walking or using a phone while driving.
