But be sure to check back later for the reports off the rest of Tuesday\u2019s action. And in the meantime here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report off Andy Murray\u2019s gripping comeback earlier today. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 3-6 Williams Williams has triple match point after following an unforced error by Ahn with her 12th and 13th aces of the afternoon. She squanders the first of them with a double fault, but makes good on the next one with a 102mph serve that Ahn can\u2019t return into the court. With her 102nd career victory at this tournament, she\u2019s officially surpassed Chris Evert for most US Open wins ever. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 3-5 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn showing fight in holding to stay in the match after Williams pushed it to 30-all and looked poised for the finish. Now Serena will serve for a spot in the second round. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-5 Williams (*denotes next server) Serena holds at love to back up the break, capping it with a 112mph ace out wide that Ahn doesn\u2019t even bother to lifting her racket for. Ahn will serve to stay in the tournament after the change of ends. Williams breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-4 Williams* (*denotes next server) It\u2019s all getting away from Ahn, who loses three quick points on her serve to fall behind love-40. She saves the first with an 82mph ace, but Williams pounces on a second serve on the following point and locks down the break with a clinical backhand winner. The end may be nigh. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-3 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams cruises to a straightforward hold to consolidate the break. A third consecutive game for the six-time US Open champion and she appears to have turned the tables on Ahn, who badly needs a hold to stem the tide following the changeover. Williams breaks in fourth game of second set! Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Williams rattles off four straight points from 40-15 to break Ahn\u2019s serve. A devastating turn for the American upstart and we\u2019re back on level terms in the second. Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 2-1 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams holds comfortably to get on the board in the second set. Meanwhile, today\u2019s victories by Andy Murray and Dan Evans have made it a banner opening round for old Blighty: Along with Monday winners Cam Norrie and Kyle Edmund, there are four British men in the second round of the US Open for the first time since 1974. Second set: Ahn 5-7, 2-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn immediately backs up the break with a brisk service game. A promising sign as the unforced errors begin to creep into Williams\u2019s game with greater frequency. She\u2019s up to 17 on the afternoon (against 18 winners). Ahn breaks in first game of second set! Second set: *Ahn 5-7, 1-0 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams looks bound to serve her way out of trouble with an ace and a forehand winner from love-30 down, but Ahn wins two quick points on Serena\u2019s second serve to steal an early break once again. Serena is 22 of 26 (85%) on first-serve points won, but only 4 of 17 (24%) on second-serve points. Williams breaks in 12th game of first set! First set: Ahn 5-7 Williams We\u2019ve seen it countless times down the years but once again Williams manages to ratchet up her level when the pressure is highest. Ahn falls behind love-30, then 15-40, giving Williams a pair of break-point chances. But she needs only one, returning a meek 76mph second serve with such power to Ahn\u2019s backhand side that she can\u2019t do more than dump it into the net. First set: *Ahn 5-6 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams serves her way out of a 15-30 hole, the fifth time in six service games she\u2019s found herself behind. Ahn will serve to stay in the first set once more. First set: Ahn 5-5 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn holds for 5-all. Says Chris Evert of Serena from the commentary booth: \u201cShe\u2019s not as invincible to the players as she once was. The players are not as intimidated. ... It would be 2-love for Serena right away when they walk out with her. They\u2019ve seen her lose a few matches and become more human.\u201d As an aside: Wednesday\u2019s order of play has just been released. The second-rounder between Novak Djokovic and Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund is second on Ashe with Naomi Osaka and Stefanos Tsitsipas slated for the night session. First set: *Ahn 4-5 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams opens the eighth game with an unreturnable serve, but Ahn makes things uncomfortable with consecutive winners for 15-30. After trading unforced errors, Ahn has another break-point chance, but Williams erases it with a 104mph service winner down the pipe. She then follows with a 103mph ace out wide and another service winner to nail down the hold, improving to 84% on first-serve points (16 of 19 overall). First set: Ahn 4-4 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn caps a comfortable hold with a forehand passing shot winner. Nicely done. First set: *Ahn 3-4 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams holds at love, opening the game with another ace out wide and capping it with a crisp backhand volley winner. She\u2019s won 12 of the last 15 points on her racket since that patchy opening service game. First set: Ahn 3-3 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn betrays her nerves with a double fault after the changeover, but steadies herself nicely with three straight winners for 40-15. Williams comes to net on the next point and Ahn sends a forehand sailing for 40-30, before following with her third double fault of the afternoon for deuce. From there, however, Ahn cleans up nicely, winning two quick points to hold. First set: *Ahn 2-3 Williams (*denotes next server) An ominous game for Serena: 110mph ace out wide, 100mph ace out wide, 122mph ace down the middle, 105mph ace down the middle. A stress-free hold and Ahn will try to keep in step after the change of ends. Williams breaks in fourth game of first set! First set: Ahn 2-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn quickly falls behind 15-40, giving Williams a pair of break-point chances. She saves the first but sprays a forehand wide on the second, allowing Williams to get back on level terms. First set: *Ahn 2-1 Williams (*denotes next server) Ahn strikes an impressive return winner as Williams falls behind on her serve again. But the former world No 1 decides no more gifts, rattling off four quick points capped by a forehand volley winner to seal the hold. First set: Ahn 2-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) Ahn consolidates the break comfortably. Five unforced errors already for Williams in the first two games. Ahn breaks in first game of first set! First set: *Ahn 1-0 Williams (*denotes next server) Kristie Ahn, who served up one of the feelgood yarns of last year\u2019s US Open with her fourth-round run, is off to a promising start against the 23-time major champion. Williams crushes a pair of aces to get it to 40-30, but follows with an unforced error at the net then back-to-back double faults. Tumaini Carayol also has serious news away from the court: The former world No 6 Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro announced on social media she has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and will undergo six months of chemotherapy. The Spaniard, known as one of the most popular players on the tour, had been planning to finish her career this year before the virus. \u201cWhen we spoke a few days ago when she gave me the news, I was, I think, shocked, because I was expecting to see her in this tournament. You know, she\u2019s such a nice woman, so sweet, so kind, so humble,\u201d said Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, a friend and frequent doubles partner of Suarez Navarro after her 6-4 6-4 win against Nao Hibino. \u201cI, for sure, will dedicate this win to her, because I want her to feel that we are behind her, that I am behind her, and I will go and see her at some point when it is fine.\u201d Murray\u2019s fellow Britons, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson, were in action earlier today with Konta coming out as winner. Tumaini Carayol has further details: Loyal reader Simon McMahon checks in via email: Evening Bryan. It shouldn\u2019t really come as a surprise that Andy continues to take us on an emotional rollercoaster ride every time he plays, but still. When you look up the word \u2018drama\u2019 in the dictionary, it should say \u2018see Andy Murray\u2019. Well put. Murray breaks in 10th game of fifth set! Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 Nishioka Murray pounds a pair of winners to push it to 30-all on Nishioka\u2019s serve and he\u2019s two points from victory. Nishioka gets it to deuce, but Murray follows with a forehand winner from the baseline to stake match point. And after a mishit overhead by Nishioka, it\u2019s over! Andy Murray has managed to escape from two sets down after 4hr 39min, saving a match point along the way. Never a doubt. Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 5-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) These service games aren\u2019t getting any easier for Murray, but he manages to hold from 15-30 down to move one game from the finish line. Fifth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 4-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Another straightforward hold for Nishioka. On we go.

Fifth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray pushes it to 30-40 on Nishioka\u2019s serve, then conjures an absolutely gorgeous lob winner to break right back. Back on level terms in the fifth. Nishioka breaks in fifth game of fifth set! Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 2-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray goes down love-15, but levels with a forehand winner. Then he goes down 15-30, but levels with a booming serve that Nishioka can\u2019t return. Then he goes down 30-40 ... but this time he double-faults. Uh-oh. Fifth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 2-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka answers with business-like hold of his own, also sealing it with an ace down the middle. Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 2-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray holds at love, capping it with a 112mph ace down the T. That\u2019s 13 aces on the day for Murray compared to 12 double faults. Fifth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka holds comfortably in his opening service game of the decider. A note for the history buffs: three of Murray\u2019s nine career wins from two sets down have come at the US Open. Interestingly enough (or not), two of those three came against left-handers like Nishioka. 2008 R3: def Melzer, 6-7, 4-6, 7-6, 6-1, 6-3 2011 R2: def Haase, 6-7, 2-6, 6-2, 6-0, 6-4 2015 R2: def Mannarino, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-0 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Another patchy service game from Murray to open the decider, but he manages to wriggle out of danger. He falls behind love-15, then 30-40, but responds with back-to-back forehand winners and a 113mph unreturnable serve down the middle. Fourth-set tiebreak: Murray 7-4 Nishioka Nishioka saves two set points, but is forced into an error early in the third. Fourth set to Murray and we\u2019re headed to a decider \u2013 but not before he takes a medical timeout for what appears to be blisters on his right foot. Fourth-set tiebreak: *Murray 6-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray wins the next point on his serve, then another on Nishioka\u2019s for a 6-2 advantage. Four set points for Murray. Fourth-set tiebreak: *Murray 4-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Serving at 4-1, Murray makes an unforced error on the backhand side at the end of a 12-stroke rally, but he\u2019s still up a minibreak as the players change ends. Fourth-set tiebreak: *Murray 4-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka overcooks a backhand on his serve to start, gifting Murray an early minibreak. But the world No 49 moves back level when Murray mishits a drop shot while serving at 1-all. Murray then wins two quick points, both on Nishioka\u2019s serve, to take a commanding 4-1 with the next two points on his racket. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-6 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray wins the first two points and we appear bound for a tiebreaker, but the indefatigable Nishioka pushes it to 30-all, then to deuce. Then Murray misfires on a volley under duress and suddenly he\u2019s match point down \u2013 but he saves it with a 127mph thunderbolt out wide that Nishioka can\u2019t return into the court. Deuce. From there Murray is able to see out the hold and force a fourth-set breaker. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 5-6 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka cruises to another love hold. He\u2019s won 22 of the last 24 points on his serve. Murray again to serve to stay in the match. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 5-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Another drama-free hold for Murray, who\u2019s won 12 of the last 13 points on his serve. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 4-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Another straightforward hold for Nishioka, who is on the precipice once more. Murray will serve to stay in the tournament after the changeover. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 4-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray appears to have righted the ship with his serve, at least for now. He goes unreturnable, ace, ace, unreturnable to hold at love and has gotten eight straight first offerings in going back to his previous service game. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka slots his sixth and seventh aces of the day en route to another elementary hold of serve. Still on level terms here in the fourth. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) A handful of loose points sees Murray fall behind love-30, then 15-40 after yet another double fault.

Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka reels off a second straight love hold, and third overall, with three crisp winners followed by a 112mph ace right down Broadway. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-2 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) And Murray responds with his cleanest service game of the day: forehand volley winner, service winner, 106mph ace out wide, backhand winner at the net. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka breezes through a love hold in about a minute\u2019s time. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Holds of serve haven\u2019t come easy for Murray today and this one is no different after his 10th double fault of the day pushes it to deuce. His 11th double gives Nishioka a break point, which Murray saves. Then his 12th double fives Nishioka another break point, which Murray again saves. From there Murray escapes with the hold after no small labor exerted. Fourth set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 0-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) A promising start for Nishioka, who is pushed to deuce but wins two quick ones from there, holding to open the fourth. Third-set tiebreak: Murray 5-7 Nishioka Both players continue to hold their serve until Nishioka, serving at 4-5, can only watch as Murray ends a 14-shot rally with a blistering forehand winner. Moments later, Murray nails down the set after an unforced error by Nishioka, punctuating it with a lengthy \u201cCome onnnn!\u201d Could the comeback be on? Third-set tiebreak: Murray 3-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray opens with a service winner before Nishioka misfires on a forehand to go a minibreak down. Nishioka pounds a backhand winner for 1-2, then Murray gives the minibreak back with an unforced error off the forehand side. After trading winners, they\u2019re level at 3-all as they change ends. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 6-6 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka falls behind 15-30, allowing Murray within two points of the set. But he wins the nets three points in quick order to force the breaker. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 6-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray threads a pretty drop-shot winner, but follows it with three sloppy points to go double break point down. This could be it. Murray erases them both with back-to-back winners, but nets a backhand from the baseline on the next point to give Nishioka a third chance at a break. Murray saves that, too, then goes on to hold with a backhand volley winner at the net, but not after being made to labor for it. Nishioka will now serve to force a tiebreaker. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 5-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka misfires off the forehand side in the opening exchange, but holds his nerve again in winning four quick points to nail down the hold. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 5-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Squeaky bum time for the 2012 US Open champion as he opens with his third double fault of the set followed by an unforced error off the backhand side to fall love-30 down. He responds with a 125mph ace down the middle and a forehand volley winner, only to follow with his 41st unforced error of the day to gift Nishioka a crucial break-point chance. Murray survives when Nishioka mishits a backhand, then rattles off two quick points to escape with the hold. Nishioka will serve to stay in the third set after the change of ends. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 4-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka answers with a stress-free hold of his own. No margin for error for Murray as he steps to the line. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 4-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray badly needed a comfortable hold and that\u2019s what he produced, winning four points on the trot behind a booming serve, including a 130mph ace down the pipe. Murray breaks in sixth game of third set! Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 3-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) A glimmer of hope for Murray as he breaks back to level the proceedings in the third set. Nishioka falls behind love-15 and 15-40 before mixing in his fourth double fault of the afternoon. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 2-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray keeps pace with a hold despite his seventh double fault of the day. He\u2019s still grappling with that first serve, getting less than half of them in the court. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 2-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Another love hold for the dialed-in Nishioka, who\u2019s won 22 of the last 27 points on his serve. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 1-2 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray comes through with an easy hold, but he will need to make some headway on Nishioka\u2019s serve after the changeover if he hopes to extend this match. Third set: *Murray 4-6, 4-6, 0-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka wastes no time backing up the break, holding at love and capping it with a 109mph ace down the middle. Nishioka breaks in first game of third set! Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 0-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Yikes on bikes. Murray is quickly broken in his opening service game of the third set, double-faulting on break point. The path to victory coming into focus for the Japanese upstart. Second set: Murray 4-6, 4-6 Nishioka Three of Murray\u2019s nine career fightbacks from two sets down have come at the US Open. He will need a fourth to reach the second round after dropping the second set moments ago to an in-form Yoshihito Nishioka. A somewhat flat Murray has chipped in nearly twice as many unforced errors (32) as Nishioka (17) while hitting five less winners. Second set: Murray 4-6, 4-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray crushes his sixth ace (120mph out wide) for 30-love. He immediately follows with his fifth double fault for 30-15, but holds from there to put the pressure on Nishioka, who after the changeover will serve for a two-sets-to-none lead. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 3-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka rights the ship with a mostly stress-free hold and Murray will now serve to stay in the set. Second set: Murray 4-6, 3-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray consolidates the break after soldiering through another lengthy service game that included his fourth and fifth aces of the day. Murray breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: *Murray 4-6, 2-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray gets one break back in what can only be described as against the run of play. After opening with a backhand passing winner, Nishioka had won 13 of the previous 16 points on his serve. But Murray rattles off the next four, aided by a handful of loose points by the world No 49. Second set: Murray 4-6, 1-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray finds himself in trouble on his serve again, mixing in his 24th and 25th unforced errors as he\u2019s forced to deuce. Nishioka nets a forehand from the baseline, but then uncorks a sizzling forehand winner past Murray as he comes to net for deuce again. The back-and-forth ensues until Murray is finally able to seal a hard-won hold after 12 points to get on the scoreboard in the second. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 0-4 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray pushes it to 30-all, but Nishioka follows with an ace out wide and forehand volley winner to back up the break. The Japanese southpaw has now won nine of 15 points at the net today. Nishioka breaks in third game of second set! Second set: Murray 4-6, 0-3 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray is deep in it now, falling behind a double break. Two more double faults early in the game allow Nishioka to push it to deuce. From there Nishioka forces Murray to net a volley, then watches as his opponent pulls a forehand wide from the baseline. Second set: *Murray 4-6, 0-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka, dialed in on his serve, cruises through a love hold to consolidate the break. Nishioka breaks in first game of second set! Second set: Murray 4-6, 0-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) A patchy first serve and too many unforced errors against an agile 145lb opponent who\u2019s getting everything back. That\u2019s been the story as bad goes to worse for Murray, who\u2019s broken for the second time today in the opening game of the second set. Murray started with back-to-back double faults, then mixed in two more unforced errors on forehands to gift Nishioka the game. First set: Murray 4-6 Nishioka Nishioka misfires early in a rally to go love-15 down, but follows with his second ace of the day: 116mph down the middle. An unforced error by Murray followed by a forehand winner up the line by Nishioka gives the youngster a pair of set points. Murray saves the first, but sends a lob past the corner on the second to hand Nishioka the opener. Only six winners against 11 unforced errors for Murray, compared to 12 and nine for Nishioka. First set: Murray 4-5 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) An expeditious love hold for Murray capped by aces of 128mph (down the pipe) and 124mph (out wide). Now it\u2019s on the 24-year-old to serve out the set after the change of ends. First set: *Murray 3-5 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka opens with a 115mph ace out wide, then races to a comfortable hold to back up the break. Murray will now serve to stay in the opening set. Nishioka breaks in seventh game of first set! First set: Murray 3-4 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray\u2019s first serve is misfiring again as he falls behind love-15, then 15-40. He brushes aside the first with a punishing inside-out forehand winner early in the point from a step inside the baseline. But Nishioka capitalizes on the second, dragging Murray from corner to corner before putting away an overhand winner. He only one of six first serves in for Murray in that game (and 8-of-23 on the day). First set: *Murray 3-3 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Serving at 15-all, Nishioka shows off his retrieving skills, answering every posed by Murray over a 23-shot exchange. He follows with his first double fault of the day for 30-all, but holds from there with a backhand volley winner and a Murray unforced error from the baseline. We\u2019re level through six games, but Nishioka has been made to work quite a bit harder on his serve. First set: *Murray 2-2 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Nishioka mixes in a pair of unforced errors from 30-15 and faces his first break point of the day. But Murray misfires from the backhand side early in the ensuing rally to waste it and Nishioka is able to hold from there. First set: Murray 2-1 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Another easy hold for Murray, who\u2019s finding the mark with the first serve a touch better than before. First set: *Murray 1-1 Nishioka (*denotes next server) Murray rips a backhand winner to open Nishioka\u2019s first service game, but the world No 49 wins four points from there for a drama-free hold. First set: Murray 1-0 Nishioka* (*denotes next server) Murray\u2019s first point in nearly two years in a grand slam singles match is a lob winner onto the baseline following a 13-stroke rally. He\u2019s forced to deuce but holds comfortably despite getting just two of eight first serves in. Today\u2019s forecast calls for showers on and off throughout the day. But the roof is open for now and conditions are pleasant with an on-court temperature of 73F (23C). The players are finished with their warmups and Murray will serve to start after Nishioka won the toss and elected to receive. Happy Tuesday and welcome to day two at Flushing Meadows. We\u2019re moments away from the day\u2019s first match in Arthur Ashe Stadium as 2012 US Open champion Andy Murray faces 24-year-old Japanese left-hander Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round. Since winning 78 matches and ending the year as world No 1 back in 2016, Murray has undergone two right hip surgeries and played a total of 68 matches. But his second-round win over world No 7 Alexander Zverev last week at Cincinnati-on-Hudson marked his biggest win since he beat then-No 2 Novak Djokovic at the 2016 ATP finals. The players have just now taken the court and we will follow with updates throughout the day. Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s how Novak Djokovic fared in his opener: Novak Djokovic got his campaign to win a fourth US Open, and 18th grand slam title overall, off to a flying start by beating Damir Dzumhur 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 to advance to the second round, where he will meet Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund. Djokovic broke Dzumhur\u2019s serve for a seventh time to seal the win in the first night match on Arthur Ashe Stadium court, which, due to Covid-19, was missing the thousands of rowdy New York tennis fans that usually flock to Queens every year. Dzumhur, who hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina, had no answer to the world No1\u2019s blistering serve and stout defence in a match that lasted just under two hours. The 28-year-old did not make it easy on himself, committing 41 unforced errors and eight double faults to fall to 0-3 lifetime against Djokovic. With the win the Serbian, who won his fourth title of the year at the Western &amp; Southern Open on Saturday, improved to 24-0 on the season. Afterwards Djokovic said: \u201cDo I want to keep the streak going? Of course I do. But am I thinking about it as a priority every single day? No. But it\u2019s there, it\u2019s an additional motivation for me and it fuels me to play even stronger and even better and play to the right intensity in every match.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
