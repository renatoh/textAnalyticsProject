The National Infrastructure Assessment is a once-a-parliament affair from a body that was created to save us from the deadly combination of politicians\u2019 machismo and the electoral cycle. More prosaically, the National Infrastructure Commission\u2019s job is to inject long-term strategic thinking into the critical business of building important stuff. Its first report contains a devastating conclusion: the government should drop its obsession with building more and more nuclear power stations. The NIC still imagines one more nuclear plant, on top of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, before 2025, but the contrast with the government\u2019s current approach is stark. Energy ministers for a decade have told us that a \u201cresurgence\u201d in new nuclear in the UK is the only way to keep the lights on while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. As for the hideous costs of Hinkley on our energy bills for 35 years, we were told they must be swallowed to get the nuclear show up and running again. Another six plants could be needed, it has been claimed. Sir John Armitt, the NIC\u2019s chairman, has cut through this cultish logic with admirable ease. There is no need to rush with nuclear because \u201cduring the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables,\u201d he says. Well, quite. The major development in the energy market in the past decade has been the plunging price of renewables. Costs have been cut faster and further than assumed in Whitehall. In last autumn\u2019s capacity auction, the \u201cstrike prices\u201d for two big offshore windfarms came in at \u00a357.50 per megawatt hour and a third at \u00a374.75. These figures \u2013 the guaranteed price for the electricity generated \u2013 compare to Hinkley\u2019s \u00a392.50. The next generation of nuclear plants really will be cheaper, the industry likes to claim, yet its boasts tend to rely on the assumption that a bigger slice of the construction risks can be shoved on to the government\u2019s balance sheet. Even if such \u201cclever\u201d financing models were deemed desirable, however, they don\u2019t change the basic facts. From a purely financial perspective, offshore wind and solar are the cheapest bets. Some \u201cbaseload\u201d nuclear may still be required for security of supply but the NIC\u2019s conclusion merely sounds like common sense: the UK shouldn\u2019t rush to tie itself to an expensive nuclear future; it should back renewables to continue becoming cheaper; and it should see what developments arrive from the world of storage technology, which could change the game again. The government, when it gets back to governing, needs to respond. Its mania for new nuclear plants has looked out-of-date, wrong-headed and unnecessarily expensive for ages. Now even its own infrastructure adviser agrees. A U-turn is required. Can Mothercare win back consumers? A decade ago Mothercare had 425 stores in the UK. By 2014 the figure was 220. Today it is 140 and, on the latest restructuring plan, the group will be down to its last 77 within a year, at which point it will supposedly emerge as a lean and restructured business that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, as the interim chairman, Clive Whiley, puts it. His predecessor, Alan Parker, promised the same \u201csustainable\u201d outcome many times over the years, so shareholders should approach with extreme caution. On the plus side, the latest rejig was accompanied by hard talk about \u00a319m of cost savings from rent reductions, store costs and central overheads as the CVA process is completed. Those savings will plainly help. The missing ingredient, however, is firm evidence that Mothercare can back win consumers in the age of Amazon and stronger competition from supermarkets. The chief executive Mark Newton-Jones\u2019s sermon about \u201cexciting\u201d plans to \u201crevitalise the brand\u201d has also been heard many times. The share price has sunk so low there\u2019s no point in shareholders throwing a tantrum. The \u00a332.5m fundraising, which will double the number of shares in issue, is underwritten, so the company will get its cash whatever happens. But a point to remember is that the company last paid a dividend in 2012. Greater retailing recoveries have happened \u2013 but Mothercare\u2019s decline is not new. A flicker of fear over Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans The FTSE 100 index rose 1% on Monday, seemingly ignoring the excitement in Westminster. Look beneath the surface, however, and four of the few fallers were companies in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s sights. The water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities were down 3% and 2% respectively. National Grid and Royal Mail also shed a little value. One couldn\u2019t call it a shudder of fear among investors over Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans \u2013 but it was a flicker of worry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
