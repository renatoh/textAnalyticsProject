The programme's host, Melvyn Bragg, may be easy to scoff at, but there's no doubt that his broadcasting has provided an increasingly rare and valuable service in our anti-intellectual culture by supplying spaces to think. In Our Time is by far the best example of his contribution. Each episode focuses on one subject in depth and features scholars with a range of viewpoints who are also teaching academics. Amid the experts, Bragg takes the role of chair and intelligent layman who steers the discussion and opens the subject up to the ingenus in the room (in other words, large swaths of the audience). The book is sold as a \"companion\" to the series; but if you want to hear the audio version, there are always 400-plus episodes available for free on the BBC website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
