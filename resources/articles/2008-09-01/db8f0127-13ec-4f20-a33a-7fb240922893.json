And KP's first press conference as captain, which was so full of love it gave me an insight into what the 1960s must have been like. Lowlight of the season The faulty registration of Azeem Rafiq, which caused Yorkshire to be excluded from the Twenty20, was an appalling administrative oversight which let down a young player whose family had been conducting a high-profile campaign for political asylum. Player of the season England player: Jimmy Anderson for his growing mastery of the swinging ball. A tougher mental approach, a coach who has allowed his natural talent to blossom and the faith of selectors have made his season. County player: Ravi Bopara. Failure of the season Rikki Clarke caused bemusement when he left Surrey for Derbyshire saying it would reignite his England career. Surely some mistake. He resigned as captain before the end of the season to join Warwickshire. Shot of the season Murray Goodwin's six over long-on from the last ball of the match which won the Pro40 competition for Sussex at Trent Bridge and robbed Nottinghamshire of their first one-day trophy for 17 years. If you were David Collier what would you change? Multiply the payments to counties fivefold to ensure that they pick more young English players. And appoint the Headingley gatemen as a second tier of immigration officials with orders to imprison all second-rate Kolpak signings without trial. Player who could be a millionaire If I woke up as Stuart Broad I don't think I'd be too worried about my mortgage. And, as a riskier prediction, watch out for a 17-year-old St Lucian called Dalton Polius: lots of talent, wonderful attitude. Paul Weaver Highlight of the season Seeing Steve Harmison return to invigorate the England side and lead Durham to their first County Championship. Lowlight of the season The greed with which Twenty20 cricket was pursued could be one of sport's great morality tales. Also, giving Michael Vaughan a new central contact when he's not good enough for Yorkshire. Player of the season Watching Marcus Trescothick, at peace with himself, open for Somerset was one of the few warming experiences in a damp, cold summer. Failure of the season Surrey. The richest county of them all were a ragbag of strong egos and fading talents and Shoaib Akhtar was the worst overseas signing of them all. And the Duke cricket ball. Shot of the season KP's switch-hit off a bewildered Scott Styris in Durham. \"Was that a switch-hit or a reverse sweep?\" a cricket writer asked a colleague. Can you imagine Neville Cardus asking RC Robertson-Glasgow such a question? If you were David Collier what would you change? Ensure that all but the very best Kolpaks are squeezed out of the game. Although, with only one overseas player, one or two per county can help maintain playing standards. Player who could be a millionaire Stuart Broad in the short term but in the future watch out for Hampshire's Liam Dawson, a real talent. Lawrence Booth Highlight of the season Tyron Henderson's last three balls in the final of the Twenty20 Cup to earn Middlesex their Stanford payday. Kent needed six but managed only two, and Henderson (4-0-58-0) was the hero. Lowlight of the season Leicestershire v Northamptonshire in May: a game that included an entire XI of players not qualified to represent England. Sir Allen Stanford's helicopter landing at Lord's did not exactly warm the heart either. Player of the season Worcestershire's opener Stephen Moore scored more first-class runs (1,451 at an average of 55.80) than anyone - and hit more sixes (23) - and still managed not to get talked about. Not bad for a bloke who plays half his matches on a supposed greentop. Failure of the season Surrey paid the predictable price for their short-term approach from 2006, when they ignored youth in pursuit of instant promotion. Their signing of Shoaib Akhtar almost brought the game into disrepute. Shot of the season Hard to get past KP's two switch-hits for six off Scott Styris, although Murray Goodwin's last-ball six off Charlie Shreck to win the Pro40 for Sussex at Trent Bridge had a drama of its own. If you were David Collier what would you change? Cut the County Championship in half. Eight four-day games per county would allow more time for practice and maintain players' sharpness throughout the season. Standards would rise; talk of a treadmill would disappear. Player who could be a millionaire Born in Surrey, bred in South Africa, the 21-year-old Middlesex left-hander Dawid Malan blew Lancashire away in the quarter-finals of the Twenty20 Cup with 103 in 54 balls. Mike Averis Highlight of the season Matthew Prior's flawless and flowing 131 - out of 277 - to set up a Sussex win in May when Trent Bridge was at its most spiteful. With the ball swinging and doing a bit off the wicket, Sussex had been 74 for six. Lowlight of the season Sitting through a Friends Provident match between Warwickshire and Northamptonshire where more than half the players were not qualified to play for England. Player of the season Marcus Trescothick, for explaining in his book and in endless interviews why he had to give up international cricket. Failure of the season Yorkshire crumbling to defeat at the Rose Bowl in August with a rank display of second-innings batting. From 45 for one they ended all out for 107, the body language almost as bad as the batting. Shot of the season Marcus Trescothick elegantly lifting Chris Martin into Row Z at Edgbaston in the Twenty20 Cup match in June. Perfectly timed on-drive and a proper cricket shot. If you were David Collier what would you change? Be more aggressive with Kolpak counties. There is no point to sides that import low-budget mediocrity. Drop them from the championship and see them in court. Player who could be a millionaire He certainly won't appear on hair gel ads and is presently too correct for one-day glory, but Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, 21 last Thursday and from Whitby, has the foundations of a complete batsman and the makings of a stellar fielder. Andy Wilson Highlight of the season Two Lancastrian bowling spells: Andrew Flintoff to Paul Collingwood in May, which brought back memories of his famous Ashes over at Edgbaston; and Glen Chapple's six for 40 against Kent in the penultimate game of the season in Liverpool, which effectively sealed Lancashire's safety and sent Kent plummeting from title contention to relegation in the space of a week. Lowlight of the season The shameless opportunism of Nottinghamshire and Glamorgan in seeking to capitalise on Yorkshire's Twenty20 registration gaffe involving Azeem Rafiq. Player of the season Will Smith - the unsung hero of Durham's championship triumph, who scored crucial runs during a tricky mid-season spell. Failure of the season: Rikki Clarke's brief stint as Derbyshire's captain. Shot of the season Murray Goodwin, needing three off the last ball to secure the Pro40 title for Sussex at Trent Bridge, going three better with a six. The authorities may have done their best to devalue what used to be a prestigious competition but it still came up with a great finish. If you were David Collier what would you change? My chairman (Giles Clarke). Player who could be a millionaire Ollie Rayner, Sussex's tall young off-spinner who can also bat a bit and takes sharp chances at slip. Richard Rae Highlight of the season The consistent high quality of the first division. Every day offered hard, competitive, highly skilled and absorbing cricket. When it wasn't raining. Lowlight of the season Audible obscene reactions from certain teams when decisions went against them. Lancashire, at home to Hampshire, spring immediately to mind. Player of the season Will Smith (Durham). After a miserable 2007, came back with a weight of runs which should see him win a place on the England Lions tour. Failure of the season Leaving bad light solely to the umpires' discretion. Sometimes they were the only people in the ground who thought there shouldn't be play - and that includes the players. Shot of the season The hook played by Paul Wiseman (Durham) against Chris Jordan (Surrey) in Guildford. Jordan is rapid, but the ball was still rising when it cleared a 30ft row of trees on the square-leg boundary. It's probably still going now. If you were David Collier what would you change? Reprieve Pro40 at the expense of one of the proposed Twenty20 competitions. It's the ideal length for Sunday afternoon and a lot more popular than the shorter form with a lot of regular spectators - emphasis on the regular. Player who could be a millionaire Chris Jordan. Potentially genuinely quick, and already a sweet striker of the ball. Began the season so impressively but latterly a victim of Surrey's appalling man management."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
