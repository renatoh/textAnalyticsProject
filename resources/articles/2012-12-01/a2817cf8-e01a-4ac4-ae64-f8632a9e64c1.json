I'm talking about Sports Personality of the Year, Homeland, Strictly, The Killing. Which leaves me with the dregs. If you decide to get out now I won't be offended ... No, wait, though. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and River Cottage: Three Go Mad at Christmas (Channel 4, Sunday), they're not the dregs. And this is a nice one. Because the three in question, going mad, are funny. Kathy Burke plays the anti-Christmas Grinch, as well as being all \"cor blimey, I'll pretend I've never been ou'a Laaaandan\". Mark Heap, a hero of mine ever since Green Wing, can't really go mad, as he appears to be very much there already. And his Green Wing co-star (and star of just about everything else) Stephen Mangan provides exaggerated facial expressions and goat puns. The three \u2013 four with Hugh \u2013 go well together; they're good company. And it's also a nice one because Hugh's getting them to do an alternative to the traditional fayre. I hate all that \u2013 the big desiccated dodo, the mini nappy-flavoured cabbages, the fat, the sugar, the brandy, the butter. As for mince pies, well, no one actually likes them, and that's a scientifically proven fact. If they did, then why don't they ever have one \u2013 or indeed any of it \u2013 during the rest of the year? See? This on the other hand looks totally delish \u2013 the wild hand-picked blewit mushroom croquettes with crispy fried oak moss; the salt-baked hand-caught whopper sea bass with a fennel and potato gratin; Stephen I-hate-goats-cheese-but-not-goat-puns Mangan's hand-milked goat's cheese cheesecake. Now all I have to do is persuade my family. Oh, it's the inlaws this year. Mmmm \u2026 sprouts. Speaking of families, that River Cottage chef, Tim, helping Kathy out with her croquettes \u2013 well he basically is Hugh Fearnley-W about 15 years ago isn't he? I don't want to interfere, but I wonder if Tim's thought about having a DNA test, with a view to getting his hands on some of the Fearnley-Whittingstall fortune \u2026 There was some of that \u2013 squabbling over inheritances \u2013 going on in The Making of a Lady (ITV, Sunday). Adapted from a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, who (perhaps understandably) is better known for The Secret Garden and Little Lord Fauntleroy, it starts off as fairly standard wannabe-Downton TV period drama. You know, dinner parties, table placements, debutants, an heirless toff in search of a second wife, an educated and pretty but penniless young woman holding out for true love ... So far, so what, though I did enjoy Lord Walderhust's romantic proposal to Emily (\"Now I need a sensible woman, intelligent enough to understand what marriage to me would require \u2026\"). It potters along like a well mannered, well-groomed mare at a gentle walk. Then, about halfway through, it's as if it suddenly realises how dull it is, or the mare is stung in the arse by a hornet, and it goes crazy. There's a sudden injection of passion, and spice from the east. A body is found in the moat, there's a poisoning plot, the cad is shot dead, the old Indian lady has a pillow over Emily's head, Emily who's pregnant \u2026 then Walderhurst comes back from abroad in the nick of time, phew! Suddenly it's period melodrama \u2013 quite entertaining, utterly preposterous. There's something of Hunderby about it \u2013 a woman in a big scary house, pregnant, a bunch of people who don't want her to have the baby. Only this doesn't have the laughs. Well, not the intentional ones. And finally, Steve does it \u2013 finally asks Becky to marry him, in Him &amp; Her (BBC3). This proposal is way better than Lord Walderhurst's \u2013 even though it all goes wrong, and it includes the line: \"I get bored when you're on the loo.\" No, actually because it all goes wrong, and because it contains that line. Isn't that about as romantic as you can possibly get, to miss someone even when they go to the loo? Anyway, it's gorgeous. I was choking up. And the good news is that's not the end of it; there's a Christmas special next week. I bloody love Him &amp; Her; it's just about the warmest, funniest thing on the telly right now. It's whatever the opposite of dregs is? The bubbles? The cream? Whatever \u2013 that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
