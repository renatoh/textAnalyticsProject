The Racing Post\u2019s Press Challenge tracks the fate of all tips offered by national daily newspapers as well as a couple of the Post\u2019s own tipsters and records a convincing success for the Guardian over the course of last year. The paper\u2019s tips in 2015 generated a return of 93.55%, more than 2% better than its nearest rival. The Guardian was the only paper whose tips performed better than all favourites taken collectively. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real team effort,\u201d said Chris Cook, the Guardian\u2019s lead tipster for the past three years. \u201cGreg Wood and Tony Paley have done plenty of tipping, as always, and we also had winners from John O\u2019Hara and Chris Corrigan. \u201cIt\u2019s really pleasing to have won and an indication of how consistent our tips have been. We went to the top of the table in late March and I believe we\u2019ve been there every day since. \u201cAfter we\u2019d been at the top for a few months, we all started to think about how depressing it would be to get run down close home after leading for so long. But fortunately there was no one playing Red Rum to our Crisp on this occasion.\u201d The Guardian finished with 2,368 winning tips over the year at a strike rate of 26%. Highlights included finding four of the first five winners at the Cheltenham Festival, most notably The Druids Nephew at 8-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
