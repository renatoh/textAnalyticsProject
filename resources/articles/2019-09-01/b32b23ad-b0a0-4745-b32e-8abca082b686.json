With Castleford\u2019s season on the line, this was as masterful an individual display as any Tigers fan could have hoped for. \u201cFantastic,\u201d was how Daryl Powell summed up his stand-off\u2019s performance: and he was right. Trueman\u2019s treble provided the headline, but this was a superb all-round show from a 20-year-old who continues to defy his years. And it ensured Castleford a priceless victory. As it transpired, the 20-0 lead the Tigers had established after 25 minutes was more than enough to beat a woeful Hull side. Lee Radford had promised a response after Hull\u2019s Challenge Cup semi-final defeat to Warrington in July; instead, they have lost four of their last five games and, having been in the play-off places for six months, are now outside the top five at exactly the wrong time. With one week remaining of the regular season, Hull have the unenviable task of needing a result against the league leaders, St Helens, next Friday to stand any chance of a play-off spot. On this form they are rank outsiders. \u201cThey\u2019ve saved some of their strangest decisions for the biggest of stages,\u201d was Radford\u2019s damning assessment. Trueman and Castleford wasted little time in setting about dismantling Hull. His magnificent pass enabled Cheyse Blair to break the deadlock after eight minutes, before back-to-back solo tries from Trueman himself, coupled with three goals from Jamie Ellis, made it 18-0. Ellis\u2019 penalty five minutes later extended the hosts\u2019 lead. Masi Matongo\u2019s try 11 minutes from half-time offered the visitors a glimmer of hope, but that was extinguished by Trueman two minutes after the restart when he completed his hat-trick. \u201cThe boys call him \u2018world-class\u2019 around the place and he\u2019s a very good chance of being that for a long time,\u201d Powell said of his protege afterwards. But Trueman\u2019s night was not done. Although Hull scored their second try through Jack Logan, Castleford finished much the stronger. Jordan Rankin sent James Clare over before Trueman\u2019s reverse kick enabled Rankin to extend the lead further. There was still time for Matt Cook to cross for Castleford\u2019s seventh try in the closing minutes, before Jake Connor was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with seconds remaining. Asked how Hull can manage Connor\u2019s temperament issues, Radford quipped: \u201cApart from taping his mouth up, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Connor has made plenty of headlines this season for various reasons but for once, this night did not belong to him: it belonged to another young Englishman with the same first name.
