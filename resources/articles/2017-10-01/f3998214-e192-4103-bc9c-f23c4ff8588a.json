In a statement released to Variety, the actor \u2013 who won an Oscar in 2009 for The Reader, a film produced by The Weinstein Company \u2013 called the allegations \u201cdeeply shocking\u201d and praised the \u201cincredibly brave\u201d women who have spoken out. \u201cThe fact that these women are starting to speak out about the gross misconduct of one of our most-important and well-regarded film producers, is incredibly brave and has been deeply shocking to hear,\u201d the statement began. \u201cThe way Harvey Weinstein has treated these vulnerable, talented young women is not the way women should ever, ever deem to be acceptable or commonplace in any workplace.\u201d She added that she had heard similar allegations but wanted them to be apocryphal. \u201cI had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been naive,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have no doubt that for these women this time has been, and continues to be extremely traumatic,\u201d added Winslet. \u201cI fully embrace and salute their profound courage, and I unequivocally support this level of very necessary exposure of someone who has behaved in reprehensible and disgusting ways. His behaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong.\u201d Winslet is the latest big-name Hollywood star to give support to the women who have come forward to make allegations of sexual misconduct by the film producer over the course of three decades. Meryl Streep and Judi Dench both condemned the producer, who played a prominent role in their careers. Meanwhile, Lena Dunham, Patricia Arquette and Mark Ruffalo all used Twitter to criticise the producer. The British actor Romola Garai told the Guardian about an incident with Weinstein when she was an 18-year-old starting out in the business that left her feeling \u201cviolated\u201d. \u201cLike every other woman in the industry, I\u2019ve had an \u2018audition\u2019 with Harvey Weinstein, where I\u2019d actually already had the audition but you had to be personally approved by him,\u201d said Garai. \u201cSo I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory.\u201d Weinstein was fired by the directors of the Weinstein Company on Sunday after they said new information about his \u201cmisconduct\u201d had emerged. The producer, who is famous for his work on Pulp Fiction and Gangs of New York, was already on a voluntary leave of absence and denies some of the allegations made against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
