Amazingly this is the first ever recording of By Footpath and Stile for baritone and string quartet, which was Finzi's Op 2 and the first of his Hardy cycles, completed in 1922. Even if the quartet writing is rather stodgy, and the vocal lines only intermittently seem personal, the subject matter - death and transience - is totally characteristic of the later composer, and Williams's performance is perfectly judged, just as his account with pianist Iain Burnside of Earth and Air and Rain, one of Finzi's greatest achievements, gets right to the core of each song, and to Finzi's extraordinary affinity with Hardy's emotional world. To a Poet is a heterogeneous collection assembled after the composer's death, of which the finest is the song on a text by James Elroy Flecker that gives the collection its title, while Intrada belongs to the same world as Finzi's masterpiece Dies Natalis, which similarly sets poems by Thomas Traherne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
