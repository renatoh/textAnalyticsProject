This one features a DIY midwife who likes slicing out fetuses before term, disposing of their corpses, then letting the mother haemorrhage to death. Dodgy cops don't prove much use, but a hot young bun-steamer (not a euphemism) decides action is required. The soundtrack is wall-to-wall sinister tinkles; sporadic chapter cards \u2013 \"The Devils Grave Raider's Breath\" [sic] \u2013 prove more baffling than useful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
