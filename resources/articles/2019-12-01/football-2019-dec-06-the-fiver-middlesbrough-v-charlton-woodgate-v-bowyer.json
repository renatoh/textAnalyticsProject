Or Woodgate v Bowyer", "bodyText": "CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGERS It\u2019s the big one this weekend, folks. The one you\u2019ve all been waiting for. A footballing duel like no other. Yes, it\u2019s Middlesbrough v Charlton! Or Woodgate v Bowyer, if you\u2019re wondering why The Fiver is bothering to get the weekend started by previewing 20th v 17th in the Championship instead of the Manchester derby. You see, the former Nasty Leeds players have a history and back when The Fiver was listening to the Strokes and pretending we had a future, we\u2019d have bet all our Tin money on the former nightspot-bothering teammates not making it into management. But here they are, 20 years later, seemingly very different people to the ones who avoided jail after a brutal attack at a night out in Leeds. And it is now refreshing to see them dishing out comforting words of wisdom and guidance to the young players who now look up to them. Of course, we\u2019re only talking about football\u2019s ability to rehabilitate and shape the lives of those involved in it. Any Boro fans who have watched Woodgate\u2019s side play would argue that there is nothing positive for them to take out of his move into management. Some would argue he has successfully stopped football altogether. Back when Woodgate was throwing shapes on his Madrid debut, we could only imagine a team under his tutelage playing as though Hunter S Thompson was managing them. Sadly, Boro have just been meh. With one win in 12 and his team scared stiff of entering the opposition half, defeat could lead Steve Gibson to hoof Boro\u2019s returning son out of the door marked Do One. The spectre of an out-of-work Neil Warnock has been looming too. \u201cIt\u2019s speculation, I\u2019m not bothered at all. I\u2019ve spoken to the owner, he\u2019s really behind me,\u201d honked Woodgate, forgetting an owner\u2019s job is to have an axe in hand when things are going badly. As for Woodgate\u2019s old drinking partner, Bowyer, he\u2019s under no such pressure having done well to keep order at Charlton while East Street Investments try to assume control of the club from serial fan-angerer Roland Duch\u00e2telet. He\u2019s also had to field a team in recent weeks while coping with a knack-crisis that has led to 14 players fighting for a spot on the treatment table. Is Bowyer looking forward to seeing Woodgate? \u201cWe played together and travelled all over Europe together so, yeah,\u201d he blathered, before a boyhood Boro fan loomed into sight. \u201cRobbie Keane is No 2, and was obviously at [Nasty] Leeds as well when we played there, so it will be nice to see them.\u201d QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe looked at a number of different venues with a relationship to [him], including a railway station, a school and a football ground. In the end, the hospital seemed to provide the best environment for showing the work. He was born in the hospital so it had a really strong connection\u201d \u2013 Sarah Tinsley, director of exhibitions and collections at the National Portrait Gallery, on loaning a 2004 film of David Beckham asleep to the ultrasound department at Whipps Cross Hospital in London. TOP 100! The final countdown to No 1 on our 2019 list of the best female players in the world. And she is \u2026 FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Mark McFadden (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) claiming Everton were originally named St Domingo\u2019s FC in honour of the saint. May I be the first of 1,057 pedants to note I was disappointed to see that this was selected as letter o\u2019the day. Everton were originally named St Domingo\u2019s because of a connection to a Methodist chapel which itself was called St Domingos, the church having been erected on St Domingo\u2019s Vale. This street took its name from St Domingo House, so named because the financier of that building had significant business interests in what is now the Dominican Republic (then, Santo Domingo). I was not surprised that The Fiver\u2019s subeditor missed this error, given their excessive daily workload in relation to this column\u201d \u2013 James Megaw Wilson (and no others). \u201cI\u2019d have thought a more appropriate saint for the long-suffering Toffees fans to turn to would have been the Beatles-orientated St Jude. He is, after all, the patron saint of hopeless causes\u201d \u2013 Richard Morris. \u201cI had a bit of a Usual Suspects moment reading Lars Gaertner\u2019s letter yesterday about disclosing your address when you win a prize, and the risk of Weird Uncle Fiver turning up to deliver it. While there have been no offbeat knocks on the door, peculiar wailings of what I imagine were once pop classics or low-key sobbing in the night, it would explain the takeaway debris, empty cans of Tin and occasional items of clothing that appear to accumulate on my drive of a morning. I thought it was just living close to a city centre, but Lars\u2019s letter made me dramatically drop my mug\u201d \u2013 Ferg Slade. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Richard Morris, who bags a copy of Forgotten Nations. We\u2019ve still got more prizes to give away, so get scribbling. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Big Duncan Ferguson is in the interim hot seat after Magic Marco got the heave-ho. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to be Everton manager?\u201d he roared. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be many, many top managers up for this job.\u201d Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s transfer-knack is over after Cas halved their ban for rule breaches, leaving them free in January to send all their young players out on loan again, splash the cash on squad reinforcements and get nowhere further than they already are. Brendan Rodgers has pleased Leicester fans and trolled Arsenal\u2019s by agreeing a new deal to 2025. Talking of the Gunners, Freddie Ljungberg was most bothered by his new charges\u2019 limp defeat against Brighton, ripping into them at half-time. \u201cWe said: \u2018This is not Arsenal,\u2019\u201d he roared, pretending it was still 2004. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r brought his little book of zingers to a pre-Manchester derby presser, quipping that \u201cat least we play every year now\u201d in a dig at City\u2019s 90s relegations. No, no. Dig up, stupid. Corriere dello Sport isn\u2019t backing down from that Smalling-Lukaku \u2018Black Friday\u2019 front-page splash, accusing its accusers of \u201clynching\u201d the paper. Macclesfield Town v Crewe is off due to the financial crisis at Moss Rose. And in ostrich news, Watford are in talks with Nigel Pearson to take over as manager for the season. STILL WANT MORE? Sol Campbell gets his chat on with Jonathan Liew about self-confidence, having to work hard for everything and the challenge ahead at Southend. Magic Marco: what\u2019s the former Everton boss actually all about, wonders Barney Ronay. Jamie Jackson on what\u2019s gone right and wrong at the Manchesters City and United this season. Nasty Leeds are flying high and Marcelo Bielsa has history in mind as they plot that elusive top-flight return, writes Louise Taylor. Arsenal need a legend in the dugout: his name is Patrick Vieira, reckons Eni Aluko. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO!
