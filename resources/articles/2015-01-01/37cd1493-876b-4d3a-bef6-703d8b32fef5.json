He had gone to bed a happy man, his professional and personal lives better than ever. He was the 28-year-old captain of Barnsley and the father of two young daughters with his girlfriend, Stacey. But he was about to be wrenched from that cosy existence and catapulted into a bewildering drama in which he was miscast as a conspirator in what threatened to be one of the biggest scandals in English football history. \u201cIt nearly broke me,\u201d Dawson says, three days after the National Crime Agency ended his nine-month ordeal by confirming that the case against him has been dropped. Now he is the one seeking answers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget 2 April 2014,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cThey came at 6.30am. Ten officers. They searched our house from top to bottom and seized some of our belongings \u2013 my mobile phones, my laptop, my girlfriend\u2019s phone, documents. Then they said I had to go down to the station. We didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d Dawson was arrested on suspicion of involvement in a major spot-fixing scam, whereby players supposedly took bribes in return for deliberately getting booked. He was one of 13 players \u2013 all of whom denied any wrongdoing and have since been cleared \u2013 collared by the NCA following an alleged sting by Mazher Mahmood, the so-called \u201cfake sheikh\u201d who had written a front-page article in the Sun on Sunday the previous December under the headline \u201cEx Prem stars in match fix probe\u201d. Within hours of receiving information from Mahmood, the NCA swooped on the players. \u201cThe police asked me about three matches in which I had been booked that season,\u201d says Dawson, who had been booked in seven of the 32 matches he had played up to that point. \u201cThey asked if I\u2019d got any payment for the cards. It may sound weird but I honestly didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry.\u201d After being held for 20 hours, the Dubliner was released on bail pending investigation into three offences: conspiracy to commit acts of bribery, conspiracy to cheat and suspicion of entering into an arrangement to launder criminal proceeds relating to match-fixing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cI know what\u2019s right and wrong. I\u2019ve got three points on my licence from eight or nine years ago and that\u2019s the extent of my criminal activity. But I was being told my career could be ruined and I could go to prison for a long time. And this wasn\u2019t just the police, I was told the NCA was above the police, like Britain\u2019s FBI or something.\u201d He did not know what to do. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to say I was nervous and scared. I obviously thought I\u2019d better get some legal advice so I rang the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. They basically said: \u2018This is too serious, we can\u2019t help you.\u2019\u201d The PFA did not respond to the Guardian when asked about this. \u201cI was disappointed with that. When even your own union say they can\u2019t do anything for you, you really worry. I knew I hadn\u2019t done anything but you always hear stories about people being convicted of things they didn\u2019t do so you can\u2019t help wondering: \u2018What do they think they have on me?\u2019 and: \u2018They\u2019re not actually going to go through with this, are they?\u2019\u201d It frustrates him that he still does not know why his name came up in the investigations. Six of the arrested players were on the books of Preston North End, another three had family ties \u2013 Stephen, Akpo and Sam Sodje, the last of whom had allegedly been filmed boasting to Mahmood that he took money in return for getting a yellow card. The only link Dawson could see between himself and any of the others was that he knew two of the Preston players from having played with them at Bury four years previously. \u201cI had never even spoken to any of the others,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept asking the police how I got dragged into this but they wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d One of the players, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, was sacked by Oldham Athletic for gross misconduct when the allegations emerged. Barnsley backed Dawson. \u201cAll credit to the manager, Danny Wilson, because he told me straight away that he didn\u2019t believe it, that he knows what sort of person I am,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cI had spent 20 hours being questioned in a police station and then the next day, without any sleep, I was leading the team out as captain against Brighton. It really helped knowing that there were people ready to stand by me.\u201d Barnsley offered to give him footage of three games under investigation. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at them,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cThe police already had them. I didn\u2019t need to see them because I know how I play.\u201d Other people, however, began to look at him differently. \u201cPeople were saying: \u2018You don\u2019t get arrested for nothing, surely there must be something awry with him,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThings were written about me. Opposition players were saying: \u2018Are you going to get booked today for a few quid?\u2019 and fans chanted: \u2018Cheat!\u2019 and so on. You have to be big enough not to react. But there were times in games towards the end of last season where I just had enough and I was ringing my mum and dad in Ireland and saying: \u2018I\u2019m thinking of coming home.\u2019 I\u2019m far from the best player but I think I\u2019ve shown over the 400 or so games I\u2019ve played here that I\u2019m a wholehearted one who gives 100% every time he goes on to the pitch. But after 11 or 12 years of giving it my all over here, I was nearly broken.\u201d His family were affected, too. His younger brother, Kevin, a midfielder at Yeovil Town, also began to get funny looks and comments even though the authorities never even asked about him. \u201cAnd my daughter had kids coming up to her in school saying: \u2018Your dad\u2019s going to jail,\u2019 and stuff like that,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cHow do you explain to a seven-year-old that the police made a mistake and they won\u2019t be coming back to the house? For nine months, every time there was a knock on the door we were scared.\u201d Dawson believes his career suffered. The allegations came when he was at the height of his playing and earning powers \u2013 he was in his third season in the Championship and felt he had proven his ability at that level, even though Barnsley were ultimately relegated. The club offered him a new contract but he wanted to stay in the Championship and, since there had been talk of interest from other clubs, he rejected Barnsley\u2019s offer. But he soon found that interest in him had evaporated. Even clubs from lower leagues turned their backs on him. At the start of this season he was unemployed. \u201cOne former manager of mine rang me and said \u2018This stuff is hurting you, you shouldn\u2019t be without a club.\u2019\u201d In the middle of August 2014 another former manager, Keith Hill, who had signed him for Barnsley from Leyton Orient in 2012, offered to bring him to Rochdale. It was a league lower down on a one-year contract with a salary less than half he had been earning at Oakwell, but Dawson was short of options. \u201cObviously he had to ask me about [the allegations] and I explained exactly what I knew and asked him: \u2018Will this affect me?\u2019 and he said: \u2018I know you,\u2019 so from then I just wanted to kick on and do everything I could for him and the club to thank them for believing in me.\u201d By that stage, although he was still free only on bail, the investigation into him was faltering. The trial of Tulisa Contostavlos collapsed over doubts about Mahmood\u2019s credibility, and the Judge Alistair McCreath said there were \u201cstrong grounds\u201d for believing that the journalist had lied under oath and attempted to manipulate a witness. The threat of prosecution continued to hang over the players, however, until last Wednesday, when they each received letters from the NCA informing them that the case against them would be dropped. \u201cIt just said no further action would be taken and my belongings will be returned next week,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cI can\u2019t describe the relief. This week I had the first good night\u2019s sleep in ages.\u201d Finally Dawson can concentrate on his football. \u201cIt was hard on and off the pitch. I\u2019m blessed to have had the support of my family and throughout we just kept saying to stay positive, that the truth will come out eventually. But it isn\u2019t easy playing football when you\u2019re wondering if somebody is watching you and ready to interpret any mistake as a sign of corruption. I even asked the manager this season: \u2018If I mistime a tackle are they going to say I did it deliberately?\u2019 From the day after I signed, the players gave the typical football banter, saying: \u2018I hope we\u2019re not going to be leaving training in a police car today,\u2019 and such things. It was light-hearted stuff but I didn\u2019t feel like laughing at the time. It\u2019s nice to be able to put all that to bed now and concentrate on playing.\u201d He still intends to get to the bottom of the accusations that were made against him. \u201cThis was not a mediocre little thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSomebody tried to wreck my career and I was told I could do serious prison time. That\u2019s not something you can let go lightly. I want to find out who dragged me into it and try to get some sort of justice.\u201d For now, though, his mind is on a big week for promotion-chasing Rochdale, who face Crawley Town on Saturday before a midweek trip to Oldham followed by one of the biggest matches of Dawson\u2019s career \u2013 the FA Cup fourth round tie with Stoke City. \u201cThe arrest couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time, but the letter couldn\u2019t have come at a better time,\u201d Dawson says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
