Having just been told that their daughter would not be revived if she became critically ill, they must come to terms with the inevitable loss of their daughter and being told that their own judgment has been impaired by emotion. Darren and Debbie Wyatt are ordinary people, who expected to have an ordinary child. Instead they've had to adapt to an extraordinary lifestyle, to understand the leads and the lines and the drugs and the needles invading their baby to keep her alive. They've had to put their trust in hospital staff, a trust they may now feel has been broken. Compounding their grief, they now find themselves in the public gaze, their private tragedy openly debated. My own son, Toby, took my family on a similar journey for the first few years of his life. He had 38 long-stay hospital admissions and each time we believed he wouldn't pull through. Like Charlotte, he has respiratory problems, worsened by extensive lung damage from episodes of ventilation. We battled on his behalf with teams of paediatricians who wanted to call it a day. We have had to accept that he will not be offered ventilation should he ever need it again. It can be used only a limited number of times because it permanently scars the lungs. Spending day and night, for months, in the confined space next to an intensive care bed, parents learn quickly about their child's condition and the technology preserving their child's life. They soon become experts in their child's care, and can argue intelligently about further treatment. Toby is now 10, and has not had to stay in hospital for more than three years. We still live on the edge, monitoring his breathing, giving him nebulisers to deliver drugs, sometimes every two hours, day and night, for weeks on end. He has never grown out of the broken sleep pattern of a newborn: two hours uninterrupted sleep is a gift; five in one night a luxury. As a family we have taken a different path. His brother, Adam, seven, and sister Francesca, 12, have grown up helping us watch him. No pieces of toys can be left on the floor. He has the developmental level of an 18-month-old and we are all subjected to the sound of him watching his beloved Teletubbies videos at the highest volume from morning to night. Now he is able to walk, he can wreck a room in 12 seconds. Schoolbags and homework must be kept out of reach - he loves tearing up books. One of the issues in the case of Charlotte centred on her quality of life. Toby, if he could talk, would soon sort that one out. He loves his life, and has a massively forceful personality and a wonderfully slapstick sense of humour. He will never live independently or hold down a job. We say he lives in a parallel universe, but it is his universe, and he loves it. Ten years ago, no one could predict the level of his future disability. If they had, would our decisions have been different? Who knows? The phrase 'quality of life' implies that there is, or should be, a set of criteria to determine the validity of some one's life but who decides the pass mark, and does Toby pass? Does he lose points for not being able to jump on our trampoline, or gain points because he laughs so loud when Francesca and Adam leap next to him to make him bounce? Medical technology has overtaken our ability to work out the rights and wrongs of the difference between preserving life and preventing death. In time, more and more children will be given the potential to live, when previously they would have faded away. Not so long ago, disabled children didn't live with their families. They weren't seen in their wheelchairs in supermarkets and parks. Now, more children survive and more are visible. Many people can't handle this. Francesca has noticed the negative reaction she gets now she is old enough to take Toby out. As a society, we have to start making tough adjustments fast. These children are here to stay. We all want the best for our children, and disability always brings some level of sadness because it often means children are denied the best in terms of opportunity. But there are also gains as well as losses. Toby has pushed us to our limits at times, but he has made us more open-minded, tolerant and aware, and brought us into contact with inspiring people we otherwise would never have met. Who, in this advanced age of medical technology, is to make decisions on the futures of children such as Charlotte? Surely, it should be the parents. Mr Justice Headley had an impossible job, and carried it out with sensitivity and compassion. But maybe he should have had access to the opinions of families such as mine, who have lived through similar ordeals, as well as the opinions of the medical profession. Charlotte Wyatt's life has been short, but she has made an enormous impact. It would be good if her case became the catalyst for change in the way decisions are made in the future. Her parents know her best, and love her most yet their intimate knowledge of their daughter has been treated as less important than a sea of medical opinion. She has been the focus of their lives unwaveringly for eleven months, yet the lessons they have learnt have been dismissed as too emotional. There may be parents who are misguided and unrealistic, for whose children safeguards need to be put in place, but I do not believe that Darren and Debbie Wyatt fall anywhere close to that category. Let us hope we can do it better next time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
