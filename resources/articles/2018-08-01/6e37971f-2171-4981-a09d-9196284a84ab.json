By night, he turns watchman, guarding his fields in Sahibpur village in Uttar Pradesh against the stray cows that trample and maraud on his fields, eating his precious crops. He is not a happy man. \u201cI don\u2019t get more than a couple of hours sleep. The last few crops were badly damaged. It\u2019s a huge problem. I ward them off with my son\u2019s cricket bat but they keep coming back,\u201d said Tyagi. The stray cows, numbering hundreds, belong to dairy farmers in the area. Once they cease to give milk, farmers can\u2019t afford to keep feeding them. Previously, they used to sell unproductive cows to the local abattoir for a small sum of money. But now, with the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh aggressively enforcing anti-cow slaughter laws, the situation is very different. The BJP has closed down the small butcher\u2019s shops (mainly Muslim-owned) that used to dot the countryside. In addition, it has mobilised its supporters: bands of right-wing Hindu \u201cgau rakshaks\u201d or cow vigilantes who patrol the countryside like private militias, ready to rain violence on anyone selling or buying a cow for slaughter. Having stoked Hindu passions over the cow to come to power, the Narendra Modi government effectively legitimised cow vigilantes who have lynched Muslims and Dalits, who they believe are slaughtering cows. Human Rights Watch reported that in the two years up to April 2017 at least 10 Muslims, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed during mob attacks related to the campaign against beef consumption. Fear of these attacks has meant that in many parts of India, cows have become the farmer\u2019s enemy. Sleep-deprived and frantic to protect their crops, farmers hold night-long vigils, spend money they can ill afford on fencing or putting barbed wire around their fields, and arm themselves with sticks and stones. In some cases, they have thrown acid on cows. As a Hindu, Tyagi reveres the cow. But not so much that he is willing for them to ruin his livelihood. \u201cIt\u2019s madness. The dairy farmers in my village don\u2019t let their cattle loose here because we know them. They let them loose in another village. The cows from other villages are let loose in my village. I can\u2019t spend my life shooing away cows. I\u2019ve got other things to do. But the BJP cares more about cows than farmers,\u201d said Tyagi. Cow slaughter has been banned for years in about 20 of India\u2019s 29 states out of respect for the sentiments of Hindus who venerate the cow. But in reality, officials were rarely bothered about what was happening on the ground in remote villages where Hindu farmers regularly sold their unproductive cows to the local Muslim butchers. This trade, albeit technically illegal, flourished. In March 2017, the Uttar Pradesh government closed down hundreds of what it called \u201cillegal\u201d abattoirs, leaving farmers with nowhere to take their cows. Other BJP state governments have also shut down cattle fairs where farmers used to sell unproductive or ageing cows either for meat or leather. \u201cAll farmers used to sell, under the radar, their old cows. Do you know much fodder costs? Do you know how many men it takes to lift a sick cow to clean the shed? After stopping giving milk, a cow can live for another 20 years. Do they feed their children or their cows? It\u2019s absurd to expect a farmer to keep them just because your ideology says so,\u201d said political commentator Chandra Bhan Prasad. Radha Kant Vats who runs a cow shelter in the Indian capital, says that farmers should hand over unproductive cows to cow shelters like his. \u201cWe will look after them and give them an old age full of dignity and love.\u201d Most BJP politicians also say the same thing but state-run cow shelters are in short supply and in many of them cows are kept hungry and in overcrowded and filthy conditions. Many of the animals die of starvation or neglect. Earlier this month, angry villagers chased a herd of cows into a shelter in Chhattisgarh state and locked them in. Reports said 18 died of suffocation. Meanwhile, the cow\u2019s enhanced social status has become something of a running joke in India. Stand-up comic Varun Grover asks audiences if they have noticed a distinctly more confident demeanour in the stray cows on the roads. \u201cBefore they used to be apologetic, clinging to the sides of the roads, taking up little space. Now, they park themselves bang in the middle as though to say \u2018hey, it\u2019s our time now\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
