The pair will renew their rivalry on Sunday when Northampton face the holders Saracens in the European Champions Cup at Franklin\u2019s Gardens and while the England head coach, Eddie Jones, will watch with interest, the prime reason he has favoured Hartley since taking charge at the end of 2015 is the leadership qualities of the Saints\u2019 captain. \u201cLeadership is something I need to add,\u201d said George. \u201cI am trying to bring it to my game and I feel good when I am expressing an opinion. It definitely makes me more engaged and brings out the best in me as a player. As a consequence I feel my relationship with the coaches has improved.\u201d Hartley did not make the squad for the Lions tour to New Zealand, four years after being included but having to pull out because of suspension. George has spent his England career on the bench but saw off the challenges of the Ireland captain, Rory Best, and Wales\u2019s first-choice hooker, Ken Owens, to cement his place in the Test side. \u201cI feel I developed hugely as a player on the tour,\u201d said George, who scored a hat-trick of tries against Wasps on Sunday. \u201cIt has given me increased confidence and I put expectation on myself because I want to play to a standard I am proud of. I think I set the standard in the second Test in New Zealand and base all my performances on that. \u201cI played with intensity and physicality and I now realise where I need to be. The week building up to that second Test was the best week that I had. I\u2019ve put a really big focus on this season doing a lot of extras.\u201d Asked what he needed to do to become an England starter after 17 caps from the bench, George replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. I don\u2019t know the answer because if I did, I\u2019d be doing it. The messages from the England coaches are that I have to improve in certain areas. The consistency of my performances needs to remain high. I can\u2019t afford to have periods where I\u2019m in and out of games. I have to make sure I am getting the ball in my hands a lot and making dents with my physicality in defence and attack. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to be second-choice, but it\u2019s the way that it has fallen. I\u2019ve learned a lot from my time at Saracens. When I started, I was third-choice behind John Smit and Schalk Brits. I learned the value of patience. When you\u2019re not playing, it\u2019s such an important time for you to improve.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen I am away with England, it is an opportunity to improve and make the most of it. I thought I did that pretty well in the Six Nations.\u201d Jones made the point this year about George drifting in and out of matches and the pair spoke during this month\u2019s national squad camp in Brighton. The head coach, who took England to Argentina in the summer, has made few public comments about the Lions tour, saying it had nothing to do with him. \u201cEddie just wants me to keep striving to get better,\u201d said George. \u201cHe was happy with some parts of my game [with the Lions] but there are areas he wants me to work on. It all goes back to consistency and making sure that I am on it all the time and don\u2019t dip.\u201d Northampton will have to be on it for 80 minutes on Sunday, and not just because Saracens have won the tournament for the past two seasons without losing a match. The Saints, who expect their England flanker Tom Wood to be fit, were beaten 55-24 by Sarries at Twickenham on the opening weekend of the season. \u201cThere has been an edge to training this week,\u201d said George. \u201cEveryone knows the importance of the match. We are the defending champions and want to get our campaign off to a flying start in a tough group. We had a magician in last week, Pete the Heat, who pointed out that the trick happens before the big reveal. What we took from that is working off the ball. People see the tries, but it is about what we do before that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
