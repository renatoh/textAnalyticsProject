Yesterday they celebrated in parliament with the opening of an exhibition about the plot, with House of Commons wines and nibbles. By another coincidence, they held a mock evacuation of the chamber yesterday morning, to train MPs and other people who work in parliament what to do in the event of a terrorist onslaught. If there is an attack outside the chamber, we will all be locked in. On the other hand, if there is a gas attack inside the chamber we will be encouraged to leave at great speed. Sadly only 30 MPs turned up for the exercise, which made it rather pointless, since everyone could get out in no time at all. Imagine if you were stuck behind the late Ted Heath as he lumbered towards the door; you'd have little choice but to phone your priest on a mobile. The exhibition is in Westminster Hall, which is a good place to have it, since the gunpowder was stored in a cellar to one side of the hall, eight of the conspirators were tried there, and four were executed just outside. As well as the exhibition, which you can visit if you wish, they had a wide range of Gunpowder Plot knickknacks and souvenirs, including mugs, erasers, key rings, book marks, chocolates in the shape of gunpowder barrels and something called Guy Fawkes mustard, which I presume is strong enough to blow your mouth off. There is also a giant, 150% size statue of Guy Fawkes, made in Lewes, Sussex, where they still celebrate the defeat of Catholicism with undiminished gusto. The sign next to it says: \"Do not cross the barrier, as the figure is alarmed.\" Well, he would be - he's about to be pitched on to a bonfire. The lord chancellor and the Speaker, holders of offices far more ancient than that of, say, prime minister, arrived to open the exhibition. The Speaker, Michael Martin, slightly fluffed one line - he said how glad he was that so many people had come to share \"in the great heresy, er, heritage ...\" This slip was splendidly appropriate since Mr Martin is the first Roman Catholic to become Speaker, something which would certainly not have been permitted in Guy Fawkes's day. He went on to say, in a heartfelt way, that he was sorry that, unlike Fawkes and his crew, the 7/7 bombers had not been discovered first, and you could almost feel the shudder run round the crowd. Blowing people up for religious reasons has suddenly come a little closer to home. I went round the exhibition with a member of the cabinet, who pointed out that the conspirators had been tried very fast and executed even faster. \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it would have warmed the cockles of Charles Clarke's heart,\" at which he laughed rather more heartily than the gag justified. It's a very informative exhibition, though necessarily there isn't very much original material, apart from Guy Fawkes's lantern. Fawkes himself was very anti-Scottish, and loathed the Scottish king James, who, he hoped, would be blown with his court back to his homeland. So he would have had all his prejudices confirmed by the fact that we now have a Scottish Speaker and a Scottish lord chancellor. Also they have a copy of the bill for 23 shillings and 9 pence for the cost of putting up ironwork to display the severed heads of Thomas Percy and Robert Catesby. So that's fun too. \u00b7 The exhibition is open from today until November 18."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
