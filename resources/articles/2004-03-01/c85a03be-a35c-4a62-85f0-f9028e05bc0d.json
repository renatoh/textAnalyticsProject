Jacobs and Collins have added a pesky 24 for the ninth wicket so far, but this has been England's day after the Windies cruised to 100 for 0. Join me tomorrow at 1.15pm for live coverage of the second day. Thanks for all the emails and good night. 53rd over: West Indies 189-8 (Jacobs 29, Collins 6) These are all vital runs for the Windies as Jones replaces Hoggard. Two singles there. But Jacobs should be back in the pavilion. Vaughan got both hands to a fierce drive in the last over, but somehow didn't cling on. He does have this bizarre tendency to make the simple look difficult. David Ludwig is starting to lose me. \"Well,\" he begins ominously, \"Heisenberg kind of took Plato into the alleyway and left him bloodied and barely breathing, didn't he? By experiment, Heisenberg demonstrated that not only is reality determined by perception, perception actually brings \"reality\" into existence! But as my friend Nicholas (who was with me for the camel incident, BTW), points out, he \"reality\" of goat meat is considerably eased by curry, which counters what he calls the \"caprid\" perception of taste and smell (\"caprid\" being technical jargon for \"goat and sheep family\").\" I see. Possibly. 53rd over: West Indies 187-8 (Jacobs 28, Collins 5) Jacobs cuts Flintoff for four - lovely shot, that - then takes two more to third man with a controlled guide. He really is a valuable cog in the West Indian machine, if machine is the right word. Vaughan then drops Jacobs at mid-off. He really should have caught that. How many times do we say that? \"In Bangladesh we make better goat curry than cricketers,\" jokes Mo Khan. \"You have not lived until you have tried curried goat brain or goat's trotter soup. I would give you the recipe of the spice mix used if anyone's interested.\" Don't all shout at once. 52nd over: West Indies 181-8 (Jacobs 22, Collins 5) Jacobs is taking the view that he might as well pick up runs when they're available - and he's quite right. Yet again, he pushes a single to mid-off off the first ball of the over. But Collins looks like he can handle himself, and works Hoggard to long leg for one. England will be disappointed if the Windies reach 200 after being 147-8. Having said that, they were 100 for 0, so I shouldn't get too greedy. Jacobs half-pulls another single and Collins survives to fight another over. \"You called me an anorak earlier,\" protests Graham Sharp. \"I was just appreciating a fine bit of bowling. If all you had to look forward to on a Friday was taking her indoors to Tesco you might get excited by the little things too!\" Easy, Graham. Easy. 51st over: West Indies 178-8 (Jacobs 20, Collins 4) Flintoff donates five runs to the West Indies total by sending down an appalling delivery that counts as five wides after Read understandably fails to make ground down the leg-side. Jacobs then pulls a single just in front of Vaughan at square-leg, before Collins escapes the strike immediately with a leg-bye. Jacobs pinches another run into the off-side, and Collins takes two more to midwicket. That was a poor over from Flintoff, who shouldn't be tired - that was only his ninth over. \"Why can't Guardian Unlimited readers have guest singers?\" implores Dave Featherstone. \"I suggest Billy Bragg though I'm not sure of his cricketing credentials.\" Non-existent is my guess, Dave. 50th over: West Indies 168-8 (Jacobs 18, Collins 2) Perhaps surprisingly, Jacobs takes a single off the first ball of Hoggard's over, leaving the right-handed Collins with five balls to deal with. He plays and misses at three deliveries that swing away, misses an attempted leg-side work, then calmly defends the last. \"Is the reality of something determined by our perception of it?\" muses Richard M-W. \"Dig out your Plato, David.\" 49th over: West Indies 167-8 (Jacobs 17, Collins 2) Flintoff wastes the rest of that over to Collins, who isn't made to play as much as he should be. When he does put bat to ball, Collins picks up two runs with a flashy drive through the covers. \"They serve \"wild meat\" in Brazilian restaurants, too,\" says Adam Connaught. \"Last time I went to one, I fed my baby some rattlesnake. She ate it but didn't exactly start begging for more.\" The police have been informed. WICKET! Sanford run out (Vaughan/Read) 1 (165-8) Shambolic. Jacobs pulls Flintoff over Vaughan at square-leg, and takes two. The batsmen turn for the third, but Sanford hesitates mid-run and Vaughan's throw to Read finds him a yard short. Disaster for the Windies on a day full of them. 48th over: West Indies 163-7 (Jacobs 15, Sanford 1) Jacobs isn't the prettiest batsman. In fact he isn't even second-, third- or fourth-prettiest. But at least he gets stuck in. You never feel you're through this West Indian side until he's gone, and he keeps the scoreboard moving with a push for one to mid-on off Hoggard. \"Here in California we usually skin the goat before we curry it,\" says Neil Adamson. \"Otherwise the hairs get stuck between your teeth.\" Which is a fair point when you think about it. 47th over: West Indies 162-7 (Jacobs 14, Sanford 1) Harmison finally gets a rest. His figures read 17-5-48-5, including 5 for 21 from his last 11 overs. Outstanding. In his stead is Andrew Flintoff, who has been more impressive as a slip fielder than as a bowler in this series so far. Jacobs picks up two leg-byes to square-leg, then a single to point after a misfield by Jones. Nanu Grewal has had enough. \"I'm back to you from Talk Sport, where everyone - like some Esperanto grammer book - has \"-ee\", as in Greig-ee, Proct-ee, added to their names and we were told during the rain that Mick Jagger-ee was munching a curry roti and was due in to sing for Talk Sport listeners.\" Blimey. 46th over: West Indies 158-7 (Jacobs 13, Sanford 1) Sanford has two shots - the forward defensive, and the fresh-air forward defensive. Both are on show in that over from Hoggard - a maiden. Time for some drinks. \"Harmison would run amok here,\" writes Jonathan Harwood in the Cook Islands. \"I got hit in the face two weeks running by medium-pace length balls. One in the mouth, one on the chin.\" 45th over: West Indies 158-7 (Jacobs 13, Sanford 1) Sanford takes a single to fine leg off Harmison and breathes a sigh of relief. Jacobs picks up four runs off the inside edge as he aims a drive through extra cover. Harmison smiles. I don't think I've ever seen him sledge a batsman. Lloyd Thompson can reveal that the armadillo season is all-year long in Texas. \"Tastes like tinned-chicken.\" 44th over: West Indies 153-7 (Jacobs 9, Sanford 0) Jacobs pulls the final ball of Hoggard's over to fine leg for four. A rare bad ball. But at least Sanford is on strike. Here's David Ludwig once more. \"Well, as Richard points out, from the goat's perspective, there is quite a difference in reality between \"living\" and \"dead\". Less so from our perspective, perhaps - it's still several kilos of slightly off-smelling hairy quadruped. On the highway south of the Dead Sea once at sunset in Jordan, our driver had to swerve violently to avoid a huge meat monolith in the middle of the carriage-way--a lorry-killed camel! Believe me, that was a very \"real\" heap of camel carcass.\" 43rd over: West Indies 149-7 (Jacobs 5, Sanford 0) Jacobs judiciously takes a single, recalling Len Hutton's advice that the best way to play fast bowling is from the other end. Adam Sanford, who bats at No9 despite a Test average of just over 5, is greeted by seven slips and a short leg. Somehow, he survives. 42nd over: West Indies 148-7 (Jacobs 4, Sanford 0) The Windies have now lost 7 for 48. Lightning really does strike twice. \"The locals tell me that a favourite 'wild meat' as it is known is armadillo, when in season,\" says Ross McEwan. \"I have no idea when the armadillo season is.\" WICKET! Best c Read b Hoggard 1 (148-7) After being softened up by Harmison, Best donates his wicket to Hoggard. He plays an ungainly shot outside off against a ball that swung late and Read pulls off a smart catch moving to his right. The collapse continues. \"Kia Orana from the Cook Islands,\" weites Jonathan Harwood. \"They do a nice line in goat curry here on Rarotonga - but sometimes it's got dog in it, not goat at all. Incidentally 47 all out would constitute a below average score in the Rarotongan cricket league, and we play on rugby pitches.\" Sounds like they might suit Harmison. 41st over: West Indies 147-6 (Jacobs 3, Best 1) Best is playing grope-and-hope against Harmison, who is landing it in the corridor every time. He takes a fearful crack on his right shoulder, which necessitates a flying visit from the physio. Ouch. A lively maiden. \"David Ludwig has knocked me down but not yet out,\" retorts Richard M-W. \"There is a difference in reality between a live goat and a dead goat.\" 40th over: West Indies 147-6 (Jacobs 3, Best 1) Hoggard is keeping up the pressure at the Media Centre End. Jacobs takes another single to mid-off, once more leaving Best with two deliveries to face. He steals the strike with a single to short midwicket. Harmison won't mind that. \"Crushed beetles?\" cackles Andrea Lowe. \"You lunatic. Then again, when I was asked to take some toiletries in to school, I thought they wanted me to make little trees out of toilet rolls tubes and tissue paper.\" And you call me a lunatic? 39th over: West Indies 145-6 (Jacobs 2, Best 0) Jacobs looks distinctly ill at ease against Harmison, possibly remembering the second innings in Jamaica, where he turned his back on a lifter and gloved it to short leg. But he pinches a single off the fourth ball of the over, and Vaughan makes sure seven slips are waiting for Best. Alas for England, he isn't made to play at either of the last two deliveries. The Great Goat Curry debate rages on. \"To be properly delicious goat curry needs to have bones in it,\" screams Sunil Sikka, his mouth frothing. 38th over: West Indies 144-6 (Jacobs 1, Best 0) Jacobs pinches a single into the covers to break his duck, but for the second time in five days the West Indian batsmen don't know what's hit them. Hoggard - remember him? - induces a couple of plays and misses from Tino Best, who has a leave-alone to rival that of Courtney Walsh. \"You don't really get curry in Mexico,\" points out Dave Ellison. \"I have had ants' eggs though.\" 37th over: West Indies 143-6 (Jacobs 0, Best 0) It's like Jamaica revisited, except this time West Indies put on 100 before they started to crumble. WICKET! Sarwan c Flintoff b Harmison 21 (143-6) This is sensational stuff from Harmison. Yet again, he finds extra bounce and Sarwan can only steer it at head height to Flintoff at slip. The Windies have lost 6 for 43 and Harmison has another five-wicket haul. The banter is high-class now, much of it courtesy of that man David Ludwig. \"Richard Moseley-Williams needs to study up on his Hegel, Hesse, and Heraclitus,\" he points out, beating me to it. \"If reality were defined by the difference between \"living\" and \"dead\", Keith Richards would be shimmering in the gray zone for the past 30 years. And Tom Jones would've left us in about, oh, say, 1969.\" Quite. WICKET! Smith c Hussain b Harmison 16 (142-5) Dreadful shot from Smith, who goes for a repeat of the shot that brought him six in the previous over. This time he gets a gentle top edge which Nasser Hussain collects gleefully at midwicket. The classic sucker-punch - and Harmison has four. 36th over: West Indies 142-4 (Sarwan 21, Smith 16) Hoggard replaces Jones, who had the slightly costly figures of 8-0-36-1. You get the feeling that Smith is going to play his strokes, which means the next hour could be crucial. Sarwan gets one that pops at him and takes the handle of the bat, but he played it with sufficiently soft hands and the edge drops well in front of second slip. And he's lucky to pick up four runs to third man after trying to leave Hoggard alone outside off. \"I just want to thank Richard Moseley-Williams for his advice,\" writes Kevin Hession. \"Incidently, the surname's Irish, as I sure Mr. Glendenning could tell you.\" 35th over: West Indies 138-4 (Sarwan 17, Smith 16) Smith is having a go at pretty well everything from Harmison. The only problem is, Harmison is finding real bounce outside off stump, and Smith's drives are connecting with nothing but fresh air. Until the final ball, that is, when Smith connects with a pull and collects six of the very best. An astonishing shot! David Ludwig is on a roll now. \"Anybody had curried iguana, perhaps in Mexico or Panama?\" he enquires into the ether. \"I worked briefly on one of the Marianas Islands in the Pacific, where well-fattened monitor lizards were kept in pens in the yard, anticipating a nice grill.\" 34th over: West Indies 132-4 (Sarwan 17, Smith 10) Jones has to send down four deliveries to complete his over. Smith takes a leg-bye from the first ball - if anything, Jones has been too leg-sidish so far today. But the last ball of the over is a long-hop outside off and Sarwan needs no second invitation to crash that one over gully for four. 8.19pm Right, here goes. Thanks for being patient and not heading off down the boozer. What's that? Oh. 8.18pm The sun is out now, but my spies tell me that it is raining in the south of the island, which, apparently, is where the Queen's Park weather comes from. Fingers crossed. \"Kevin Hession needs to travel more,\" writes Richard Moseley-Williams. \"They don't use real goats, they use dead ones. Incidentally his surname sounds of middle-eastern origin. If he doesn't have a DB in his family tree, he probably has goat-eating ancestors.\" 8.13pm Not long now before the England attack resumes its attempts to dismantle the Windies. One more wicket and it's Ridley Jacobs, followed by the tail. Here's David Ludwig with another contribution to our menu of culinary titbits. \"While those of you who have tasted curries around the world might be tempted to tell Kevin Hession that you can d**n well curry anything at least marginally edible, here in Baltimore there was a Mr. Braznell who ran a Caribbean restaurant of much authenticity. Mr. Braznell drove to the immigrant neighbourhoods in New York City twice a week for the meat for his goat curry, because \"d'goats in Baltimore barely ed'ble, mon\". His goat curry was wonderful, by the way.\" Sounds like a kind of North American Mr Kipling. 8.08pm Play will start tomorrow at 1.35pm, in an effort to make up for the lost time today. So far, we've had only 33.2 overs - the equivalent of just over a session. \"Has anyone mentioned Charlie's Black Pudding, a Trinidadian speciality,\" wonders Dave Ellison. \"Best black pudding ever.\" I grew up with the mistaken belief that black pudding was made out of crushed beetles. So I never touch the stuff. 8pm The umpires say that play can continue until 6.05pm local time (10.05pm GMT), but I suspect the elements might have the last laugh. Still, in theory, there's a full session to go. Plenty of time for this match to unravel. \"Sorry it's going a bit slowly,\" says Sam Knight, apologising needlessly. \"I'm bored nearly blind in a library in New York, wondering what the cricketers do when it's raining. Do they tease each other or play catch or just eat something? The idea of one of them volunteering chirades, or pulling out a guitar is all a bit unsettling.\" If you knew what they really got up to, Simon, you'd be a little more than unsettled. 7.55pm The umpires reckon we might start at around 8.15pm GMT, so hang on in there. \"I know I'm just an American without a DB name or gourmet taste,\" simpers Kevin Hession, \"but what is goat curry? Do you use real goats or will any available farm animal work?\" 7.52pm \"We're bathed in glorious sunshine here in south-central Trinidad,\" reports or man at the scene Ross McEwan. \"Unfortunately the QP Oval is in north-west Trinidad. However it is as humid as a curry shop kitchen at 11:05 on a Friday night, so the ball should swing as much as (insert your own simile) when play starts again.\" 7.50pm Oh, the irony! John Sims, he of the beautifully brief nomenclature, is technically of double-barrelled stock. \"My father's great uncle twice (forcibly) removed, wasn't a fifth generation DB, but at least he had a sense of humour,\" he says. \"To add to his cachet, he went from being Lyndsey German (an unpopular name in the 1930s) to Lyndsey Lyndsey-German; very germane, as the older generations have it at family do's.\" 7.45pm The covers are now coming off. \"Great entertainment and the cricket's alright as well,\" jokes Nikki. \"I'm cooking a (West) Indian meal: chicken with ginger and garlic in coconut sauce. It's looking as good as Harmison's figures.\" That's nothing, Nikki. I've just eaten a sandwich which I bought from one of those machines that usually dispenses prawn and cocktail crisps and snickers bars. It looked as good as Chanderpaul's fatal nibble at Jones. 7.35pm England will be delighted to get even 10 minutes at Ramnaresh Sarwan and Dwayne Smith - conditions are ideal for bowling and they could have the Windies on the rack before play starts tomorrow. Well, a man can dream. \"What's with all this talk of exotic cuisine?\" scoffs Simon Gaunt. \"Trapped here as I am in the American Midwest, I find that if you can't get it at a drive thru, you don't eat it. I would like to report that I have recently finished Burger King's new Crispy Chicken Sandwich and it was actually quite good, at least for the 10 minutes it took to eat. Now I feel oddly queasy.\" Odd, that. 7.30pm Apparently the rain has stopped but the covers are still on. Quite what that means is beyond me. Here's Sam Dineen. \"Just a quick note to Mat Wrigley,\" he begins. \"Adding further to the food debate. Matt, fish, whether jerk or not is a MEAT. You are therefore a meat eater. So why not just plunge in and try that cow foot stew as opposed to namby-pambying around pretending to be a vegetarian.\" Steady, Sam. This is supposed to be a friendly over-by-over. 7.20pm All this rain is getting rather tedious. Still, here's Richard Moseley-Williams, who calls himself \"a genuine fifth-generation DB\". \"I've been asking myself what Brian Lara could do to help his batters cope with Harmison?\" he reveals. \"It's Harmison's height that's the problem. Lara needs to take his team to the nets, bring out the bowling machine, and a barrow load of cement blocks. Put the blocks under the feet of the machine until its about 10 feet off the ground. Ratchet up the speed to 90 mph and give the batters some practice. An attending ambulance would also be handy.\" 7.10pm This is starting to feel rather lonely. The rain is coming down in torrents, the emails are doing precisely the opposite, and my so-called colleagues have disappeared down the boozer. 7.05pm Guess what? It's raining again, so the Windies will have to wait to add to their total of 127 for 4. \"I thought I would add to the Trini food debate by noting that our office in Port-of-Spain lies betwixt the Queens Park Oval and the Cow Heel Soup Centre,\" reports Mat Wrigley. \"Were I a meat eater, I would naturally report back on this delicacy: I am not unfortunately. Today I had a felafel for lunch as it happens, having had some jerk fish yesterday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
