Maybe football needs a break from Rob Styles. Or he could be just another of those referees who are fated to be dogged by controversy. It happens. Norman Burtenshaw was a reasonably competent ref who during his 11 years on the Football League list managed to get himself knocked out by Millwall fans, responded to a clampdown on fouls by immediately sending off George Best and was attacked by the entire Benfica team during a pre-season friendly at Arsenal. It is Styles's misfortune to be refereeing in the age of the instant playback which makes everyone an expert with hindsight. His decision on Monday to send off Newcastle's Habib Beye and award Manchester City a penalty at St James' Park, ruling that the defender had brought down Robinho and denied the Brazilian a scoring opportunity, was subjected to even more intense scrutiny in view of Styles's previous record in similar circumstances. Even before the Football Association rescinded Beye's red card on Thursday the file on Styles was beginning to bulge. Early last season he gave Chelsea a penalty at Anfield after Florent Malouda had merely stumbled into Liverpool's Steve Finnan. \"It was an invisible penalty,\" declared Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the bemused Liverpool manager. Last March Styles awarded Birmingham a penalty after their own Gary McSheffrey had shoulder-charged Manchester City's Sun Jihai. The normally reserved Sven-Goran Eriksson, then City's manager, was moved to remark that: \"I've never seen anything like it.\" At Old Trafford last month Styles surpassed himself when Bolton's Jlloyd Samuel dispossessed Cristiano Ronaldo with a flawless sliding tackle only to discover that he, too, had given away a penalty. Gary Megson, the Bolton manager, thought Styles was going to book Ronaldo for diving, which would also have been unjust. Megson described the penalty as \"a nonsense decision\" and two days later Styles agreed, apologising for his error. Sir Alex Ferguson, unusually magnanimous, felt the referee had shown commendable character and humility and deserved much credit for saying sorry. After all Manchester United had won the game. Nevertheless the climbdown probably spared Styles an idle weekend. Keith Hackett, the refs' boss, could have suspended him but instead sent him to Tottenham, possibly as a reminder that, however hard life might seem, there is always someone worse off. The commendable tome Hackett's Law lists \"The Five Cs of Refereeing\": control, communication, courage, consistency and commonsense. In Styles's case a sixth C-word comes to mind. Contrition, what else? Television replays from several angles suggested that Monday's penalty at Newcastle and the subsequent red card was a bad call because in tackling Robinho from behind, Beye had taken enough of the ball before the forward fell over his outstretched leg. Later in the match Nicky Butt dispossessed Robinho in similar fashion and again the Brazilian went to ground but Butt was not penalised by Styles who had probably seen the tackle from a better angle. His earlier decision to punish Beye was based on a long-distance view from directly behind the players involved. He saw the tackle go in and Robinho go down but apparently did not spot how much the defender had got on the ball. Controversies of this kind were bound to multiply once the game's authorities had decided that players guilty of fouls in the penalty area could be sent off if a scoring chance had been prevented. This meant that the victims of a bad decision faced the double whammy of unjustly losing a man as well. Yet it should not be forgotten that in becoming stricter with tackles from behind, the game has gone a long way towards ridding itself of the sort of challenges which for decades set British football apart from the rest of the world. By the early Seventies, in England, a skilful player could not turn with the ball for fear of being hacked down by an opponent coming in from behind or the side. At the same time referees should still be allowed to decide when a challenge from behind has been fair even if, almost inevitably, there is contact with the opponent. In the meantime those who have lambasted Styles should remember that at least British refs make honest mistakes, in which respect they are a bit like Humbert Wolfe's view of the press: You cannot hope to bribe or twist, thank God, the British journalist. But seeing what the man will do unbribed there's no occasion to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
