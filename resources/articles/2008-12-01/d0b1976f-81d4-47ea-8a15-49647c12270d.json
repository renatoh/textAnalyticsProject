How do? In all the bleary-eyed confusion yesterday, well that and the ranting about Belgium, Christmas parties and depression, I kind of forgot to say what a truly superb innings that was by Andrew Strauss. Belligerent and self-assured, everything he once was and that we would ask him to be again. Even if it was very ugly to watch. On the front page of the paper today, you'll find this piece, and if you ever wanted an idea of the character of the man then you'll find it in his words there. Strauss, of course, is the captain England should have had but didn't in the last Ashes series. He's a vital presence in this England team as a man with the weight and strength of opinion to counter-balance KP's forthright, arrogant even, leadership. No3 in an ongoing series of observations about the Guardian's new well-appointed offices: I particularly like the inspirational slogans stenciled onto the glass walls around the fringe of our lickedy-spit shiny new home. Over here by the OBO gulag for example, we have the phrases 'unclouded' and 'co-operation' looming over us to help Smyth and I feel like worthwhile human beings when we're sat here in the early hours. Some of them have been put on the sliding doors of office cubicles. Over by the front entrance to this floor for example is the phrase 'assist'. At the moment though, the door is unfortunately ajar, meaning that as you walk in here the first thing you see are the phrases 'wide' 'high' and 'ass' in short succession. Well you didn't think I'd stay uncomplaining for long, did you? There is nothing like peeling the cellophane from the ginsters cheese ploughman sandwich which you've just purchased from the fabulous BP garage forecourt across the way to make you feel alive at 4am. Fortunately I stocked up on free food at the guardian christmas party last night, filling a canvas sack with festive quinoa salad. Then I got home and thought 'what the bloody hell have I done that for?' Well, I could hardly take advantage of the booze could I? Not with all you good readers to impress in the early hours. I left too early to tell you who disgraced themselves, but when I leaving I'd have oput my money on that man Tom Lutz, whose eyes were rolling back in his head quite alarmingly. \"Morning\" chirrups Ross Moulden, \"Nice to finally get the chance to properly follow some Test cricket, instead of the glut of 20/20 and ODIs that seems to have been going on recently. Good to see things haven't changed much either; England's still perfectly capable of royally stuffing up a promising position. Jimmy Anderson to do a Gillespie and score 200. You heard it here first.\" And last, I suspect. 229-5 hmm? They'll want at least 400 on this pitch, but they'll do damn well to get near it. Oh look they're starting, and just as I was about to tell you to go and have a look at Smyth's excellent piece on on how the salad days of two members of the Sky commentary team, Atherton and Hussain. 91st over: England 229-5 (Flintoff 18 Anderson 2) Ishant opens the attack for the day, with the old ball. Presumably he's expecting it to reverse swing. His third ball pins Flintoff on the pads, beating his across-the-line swipe. Hawkeye says he was out, but nobody agrees with it, least of all umpire Bowden. \"Is there anything less motivating than motivational comments?\" asks Lee James, \"Predictions - Today we will take a few early wickets, have India at 50-2 and then realise that unlike us they actually bat deeper than 4. Ah, I missed test cricket; it's the fragile hope that make it a more enjoyable torture than ODI's.\" 92nd over: England 229-5 (Flintoff 18 Anderson 2) And at the other end, Zaheer Khan. \"Did Booth justify his position as 5/2 joint favourite? (see bottom of yesterday's fiver)\" asks Toby Joy, \"I'd have thought Glendenning would have been a value bet at 6s.\" Ah I couldn't possibly comment. I may have seen Booth wrestling with one of the dwarves hired to act as human platters for the cold-meat buffet after he refused to cut him another slice of ox-tongue, but apart from that I couldn't possibly comment. He had a wine and left early, as did, for the record, I. WICKET! Flintoff 18 c Gambhir b Mishra (93rd over: England 229-6 (Anderson 2 Prior 0) Dhoni whistles up Amit Mishra, and his third ball prompts another loud LBW appeal, which Bowden again refuses. Amazing how quickly the intensity has ratcheted up this morning, India have stepped straight into it, and England are under some real pressure here... and he's gone! Flintoff is caught at short leg! And England haven't even scored a run yet. In comes Matt Prior. 94th over: England 232-6 (Anderson 3 Prior 2) Zaheer cuts his first ball through Jimmy Anderson's gate, making him look every inch the tailender he is. Finally a run comes, the first for 33 deliveries, as Bumble snappily tells us. Zaheer pusshes up a yorker but Priror picks it and swats it away through backward square fior two. 95th over: England 237-6 (Anderson 4 Prior 6) Tom muses, a little gleefully you suspect, \"The boardroom in my old office had a lovely group picture of our Directors next to the word 'Reliability' which was all well and good until some wag removed the 'Re'.\" Prior nudges two runs to leg, decides he likes it and then does it again. 96th over: England 239-6 (Anderson 5 Prior 7) \"Oh well. I didn't expect the Lancashire paceman to last long this morning. Hang on...\" quips Gary Naylor. Or at least one of the many drones that work to make up the personality that is Gary Naylor and ensure that the GU site is supplied with his email analysis through day and night, seven days a week. Brilliant fielding by Gambhir at short leg, who plucks the ball from the air on the bounce as it passes his head and then throws down the striker's stumps in one swift movement. 97th over: England 241-6 (Anderson 5 Prior 9) Prior rides a spitting leg-break from Mishra down to third man for two. \"Nothing worse than a Xmas party at the best of times,\" observes Andrew Stroud,\" but one where you can't even blot it out with alcohol - well I'm amazed you lasted as long as you did. Arguably the pain &amp; disappointment of supporting and writing about England steeled you for it.\" Yup that and the booze. Ahh, I mean, that and my moral fortitude. 98th over: England 241-6 (Anderson 5 Prior 9) The most disappointing thing about our new offices is that the boffins haven't figured out a way to let me just sit here and provide OBO commentary without typing. Couldn't they just stream my inner monologue? 99th over: England 243-6 (Anderson 6 Prior 10) \"You may mock your office's new Brentesque motivational slogans, but what you're forgetting is that some marketing or HR tit was paid a hell of a lot of money to come up with them\" points out Will Sinclair, \"Which is quite an unmotivating thought, isn't it?\" Hey man, those guys are doing sterling work. How are people ever going to know we have 'character' unless we write it on the wall in the red paint? Anderson top-edges a sweep out to the deep, but now they've got the wicket they wanted the Indians have slackened their intensity a touch, and the cries of 'catchit' are rather half-hearted. 100th over: England 243-6 (Anderson 6 Prior 10) Dropped him! Rahul Dravid of all people, at first slip. Ishant Sharma runs his finger through his hair in frustration. Very simple stuff it was too, looping off the outside edge straight to him. \"We're going to collapse horribly,\" moans Ben Shepherd, \"An 78 ball 12 from Jimmy to be our batting highlight.\" Obviously don't reckon Strauss much. do you Ben. 101st over: England 246-6 (Anderson 8 Prior 10) \"Time for Prior to not only justify his place in the team, but also to justify the use of a nightwatchman to protect him last night,\" harrumphs Robert Elsam, quite rightly. \"Was anybody else mildly surprised when Anderson was sent in last night?\" Yes, and at the same time no, because this is Peter Moores' England after all. \"Apparently in the 1930s apprently Middlesex used to use a lunch watchman, so as not to spoil the leisurely lunch of some gentleman player by having the inconvenient prospect of having to go out and bat before luncheon.\" 102nd over: England 247-6 (Anderson 8 Prior 11) The game drifts on, my mind drifts away. Here's an email. It's not very good, but it is from someone with the preposterous monicker Donato Jaggers, and by the standards of my current early-morning laziness and desperation that's more than enough to make it worth publishing: \"I have spent a lot of time in India.\" - can I just interrupt here to say you already sound like just a teensy bit like a real berk?, OK? good - \"In most towns and even villages it is common to see a full game of cricket being played by boys, teens and young men. India now has a population of over 1 billion. Given their dedication and enthusiasm and the quite frankly overwhelming numbers, is it any surprise England are being well and truly humiliated?\" 103rd over: England 247-6 (Anderson 8 Prior 11) Mishra hustles through a maiden with undue haste. 104th over: England 248-6 (Anderson 8 Prior 11) \"After some questioning of some player's motives for returning to India, it's good to see that none of the players appear to be playing for an IPL contract.\" Particularly pithy version of Gary Naylor we're getting this morning. Strauss aside you mean? I'm sure they'll be dead keen to get a him in the big-bang leagues, what with his remarkable ability to block the first five ball of every Twenty20 over and then steal a single from the sixth, ensuring a rocksolid start of 20 from the first 30 balls of the innings. I'm rambling aren't I? Good thing it's drinks, then. 105th over: England 253-6 (Anderson 13 Prior 12) Mishra continues, as does Bumble, laying into the way England have played the spinners in this innings. To paraphrase, they've had no gumption. That said, Jimmy Anderson has just reverse-swept four through backward point. Preposterous as that sounds. 106th over: England 260-6 (Anderson 14 Prior 17) Harbhajan comes into the attack for the first time today, and Anderson snappily cuffs him through mid-wicket, then walks down the pitch proddding at random bits of the pitch as though he were Herbert Sutcliffe himself. Suitably inspired, Prior then sweeps for four more through mid-wicket. 107th over: England 261-6 (Anderson 14 Prior 18) A man who pleads that I don't mention his name also had his Christmas party last night, and it was one of the all-time greats: \"to save money we had a buffet in the office from which we were told we were only allowed take two sausage rolls each before going down the pub, where we are all allowed one free drink. I asked what would happen if we took more, and was told it would count against me in next year's annual review.\" 108th over: England 263-6 (Anderson 14 Prior 20) That'd be 34 runs in 18 overs then. 109th over: England 265-6 (Anderson 15 Prior 20) \"I've nothing witty and/or insightful to add,\" starts Ben Braithwaite, with, I'm sure you'll agree one of the great opening to an OBO email, \"but thought you might be excited to know that I just had dinner at the same restaurant as Beanie Man, Dwayne Bravo and a fairly large number of (fairly large) hangers on. Dwayne was eating sweetcorn. Rather than skittling the Black-caps. So there.\" Was he wearing shades indoors? I'd wager he was. 110th over: England 270-6 (Anderson 19 Prior 22) Nice shot by Anderson, chopping four runs through the off side with no little style. WICKET! Anderson 19 c Yuvraj b Mishra (111th over: England 272-7 (Prior 24 Swann 0) And there the stoic resistance ends, Anderson slog-sweeps a catch down Yuvraj's throat mid-wicket, and Mishra's extended spell has paid off. Here's Swann's maiden Test innings then, and this should be interesting. Swann doesn't bat so much as hit fours. That said, he has scored over 6,000 first class runs, including four centuries. 112th over: England 275-7 (Prior 26 Swann 1) Prior larrups a single to mid-on. \"Does it count if they were worn upside down on the back of his head?\" asks Ben Braithwaite of Dwayne Bravo's shades, \"He was also sporting an understated gold and diamond watch that probably cost more than everything I own. By some way.\" Good to know Stanford's cash has gone on something worthwhile. 113th over: England 276-7 (Prior 27 Swann 1) Yup. WICKET! Swann 1 c Dravid b Harbhajan (114th over: England 277-8 (Prior 27 Harmison 0) Vicious delivery from Harbhajan, spitting up out of the pitch and taking the outside edge on its way through to Dravid at first slip. An ignominous score for a man on debut, but it was a brute of a ball, absolutely outrageous bounce. Bodes well for England that, at this stage. 115th over: England 280-8 (Prior 31 Harmison 0) 48 runs from 24 overs so far in this session. Grief. Prior swats two runs away around the corner. 116th over: England 281-8 (Prior 32 Harmison 0) Playing quite tidily here is Matt Prior, picking up a single from the sixth ball to keep the strike. 117th over: England 288-8 (Prior 34 Harmison 5) Harmison unleashes that gangly sweep of his, played with trademark tentativeness. It fetches him three. Sir Iron Bottom is really sounding especially Alan Partiridge-esque today. 118th over: England 291-8 (Prior 36 Harmison 6) \"Dwayne Bravo missed out on the Stanford's booty, so his watch probably isn't as expensive as it looks\" rejoinders Gary Naylor. Oh my dear old thing, I was of course referring to the domestic Stanford 20/20 of earlier this year, which was won by T&amp;T. Bravo picked up a novelty oversize cheque for $25,000 simply for running someone out. I believe it was called the 'play of the day award'. Anyways, Gary continues \"Perhaps Dwayne favours the more gaudy timepieces available through mail order catalogues rather than those advertised by Lewis Hamilton et al.\" 119th over: England 294-8 (Prior 39 Harmison 6) The final over of the session is bowled by Yuvraj, Mishra havinfg seemingly been on all morning. That's it then, for now. I have to go and convince security to let Smyth in the front door. I can't blame them for being suspicious, but then I've no inclination to do the second session so I'd better go get him. LUNCH Hello Are you sitting uncomfortably? Good, because at some stage this afternoon England will enter the unique torture chamber called Bowling On The Subcontinent, where you have your nipples tweaked, your eyes bathed in sweat, and your length balls scorched through the covers. England resume on 294 for eight after a morning in which the returning Matt Prior (39 not out) showed he is by some distance the best Test batsman/wicketkeeper in the country, and James Anderson showed that, what England have lost in a skilful, streetwise, experienced, all-weather seam and swing bowler, they have gained in, er, a nightwatchman. Anderson survived for 82 balls but, even though slim hasn't quite left town, there's no doubt England are well behind here. The manner in which Graeme Swann was dismissed, by a leaping snorter from Harbhajan, will have paradoxically pleased batsman as much as bowler, but I still fancy India to get 450 here and put England out of the game on a pitch that will take spin more and more. Publicise your own work department which in many ways is bad form but then again it's completely disappeared from the sport page already I mean I know it wasn't a great piece maybe a bit long and not very funny but frankly I've read worse Plus, for those so disenchanted with the present that the past is their Happy Place, it's a pretty nice story. I love Dead Kids And that's not something e e cummings could have legitimately said. They're a brilliant unsigned band, whose new single Into The Fire I would unequivocally recommend. Although their first two singles - Dead Wife Pills and Fear &amp; Flouride - are even better. Naylor in da house \"Nasser and Ian Ward have been interesting in the studio, dealing with some fairly technical stuff re: the forward press - but even I found it a bit much for 6.05am,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Thank God Dominic Cork was there to spout exactly what Botham always spouts, only a little faster. That Corky was the poor man's Botham as a player is no shame, but a poor man's Botham as an 'expert'?\" Haha. I really enjoyed that little chat between Nasser, who is brilliantly curious about every facet of the game, and the underrated Ward. \"How was the Christmas party?\" asks John Adams. No idea as I wasn't invited. I hope the others all wake up to life-threatening hangovers and the realisation that they've left yellowy discharge all over their silk sheets. Anyway, I had my own Christmas party: wearing nothing but Captain America grundies and an ill-fitting Santa hat, regularly dousing my tongue with cheap whisky, while watching Das Boot. It was such an unmitigated triumph that I'll be doing exactly the same next year. And tonight, in fact. So what can England achieve here? The optimistic will point to the first innings of the first Test of the last series between these sides in India, when England got from 267 for eight to 393 all out. But on that occasion the batsman at the crease was Paul Collingwood, who could skip easily and effectively into one-day mode. As we know, Prior's one-day mode isn't so effective. Nonetheless, Prior has to go big from the off I'd say. If he gets out, no complaints. 120th over: England 297-8 (Prior 40, Harmison 6) Harbhajan begins to Prior, who sweeps into the leg side for a single, and then Harmison gets a couple of leg-byes. \"You're recommending an East London post grot'n'roll band?\" says Patrick O'Brien. \"That puts an apostrophe in the plural of DJ? You're being very undude.\" Says the apostrophe snob himself. The Dude certainly wouldn't abide that. This grammar fascism will not stand, man. 121st over: England 302-8 (Prior 45, Harmison 6) Surprisingly, it's the birthday boy Yuvraj rather than Mishra at the other end. Spinners have bowled more than two-thirds of the overs, which isn't often the case in the first innings of a Test, and it tells you which road this game is going down. Prior tucks his first two balls into the legside for sharply run twos to take England up to 300. He is a proper Test batsman, this fellow. If only he could catch an effing cold. \"We had our office Christmas party the other day,\" says Mac Millings. \"Everyone sat round the table eating lunch in near silence, and after about 45 minutes we left. All in all, I'd say it went much better than expected.\" 122nd over: England 303-8 (Prior 46, Harmison 6) Prior takes a single off Harbhajan's first ball, so clearly he trusts Harmison. I've never really subscribed to that old Steve Waugh theory of trusting tailenders: what you gain in empowering them you more than lose the obvious difference in the quality of the two batsmen. England could easily lose two in two balls here - although at this stage Harmison is using his big stride very, very well to negate the spinners - which is why I wouldn't take a single until the fifth ball at the earliest. WICKET! England 304-9 (Harmison c Dhoni b Yuvraj 6) That's the risk you take: Prior takes a single from Yuvraj's second ball and Harmison goes two balls later. It was an odd dismissal: Harmison thin-edged a good delivery from Yuvraj through to Dhoni and walked, but in the meantime Yuvraj had done a 180-degree spin in frustration, hands on his head and thinking the ball had missed the outside edge. It was a good five seconds before he realised Harmison was out. 123rd over: England 304-9 (Prior 47, Panesar 0) Monty survives the rest of the over. 124th over: England 305-9 (Prior 48, Panesar 0) Again Prior takes a single from the first ball of Harbhajan's over, a tactic I am struggling to fathom. But Monty survives the rest of the over, despite having five men plus the keeper around the bat: two slips, leg slip, silly point and short leg. Harbhajan does beat him with one spitting jaffa. \"Harmy was pretty sharp to turn on his heels and walk,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Did he think he was heading off for a Bothamesque trek to Ashington?\" 125th over: England 307-9 (Prior 49, Panesar 1) Prior really is getting 'em in singles: there's another off the first ball of Yuvraj's over. Panesar then gets a single off the fifth ball, and keeps the strike when Yuvraj pins Prior to the crease with the final delivery. Slightly odd this from England, you have to say. 126th over: England 309-9 (Prior 50, Panesar 2) Panesar - we don't call him Monty now he's not very good, do we - gets a single off Harbhajan's first ball - and that allows Prior, on 49, to tuck one off his pads and reach his a serene fifty which has contained just one boundary. This is an excellent performance, and what I like about Prior is that, in his fledgling career, he has consistently done it on the subcontinent, which shows there is a lot more to his game than the sometimes misplaced machismo we see in the one-day matches. Anyone out there or did the world have its Christmas party last night? 127th over: England 312-9 (Prior 51, Panesar 4) Mishra replaces Yuvraj but Prior continues to bat in a way that might lead some to accuse him of red-inking: he takes a single off the third ball. Then Panesar smears Mishra over mid-off for a couple. \"Go on Monty!\" chuckles Mike Atherton, who also makes the point that Monty/Panesar would be much less comfortable facing the seamers, and it is a surprise that they haven't given Zaheer and Ishant the new ball and told them to end this nonsense. 128th over: England 315-9 (Prior 52, Panesar 6) Prior again takes a single early in Harbhajan's over, and that exposes Panesar to a jaffa that pitches on middle, bowled from around the wicket, and turns and bounces brutally to hit the pad - so much so that Hawkeye has it going over the top and probably missing off. That's a superb decision from Daryl Harper to say not out. \"Like you, I think Belly Boy should go back to county cricket and Tresco a few county attacks, to return to Tests a more forthright personality, but I wonder what the reaction would have been had he made a fifty with the tail in the style of Prior,\" says Gary Naylor. \"There's a thin line between the diffidence of Bell and the watchfulness of Prior.\" That's very true, but I'm too busy adding the verb 'to Tresco' to my internal dictionary. That said, Bell's main problem is cheap runs down the order rather than diffident runs, no? What I would say is that, if Jacques Kallis played as Prior has since lunch, he'd be slaughtered. WICKET! England 316 all out (Panesar LBW b Sharma 6) Ishant Sharma replaces Amit Mishra and yet again Prior takes a single, this time off the second ball. As Beefy would say, I'm sorry, but I just don't understand this. And with wearying predictability, Sharma pins Panesar in front two balls later. England let the tortoise get away from them with their post-lunch tactics. Prior ends on 53 not out - had he gone big after lunch he might have got 40, but he might have got 80 not out - and I'll see you in 10 minutes. Mid-innings email fun \"Prior obviously played for a not-out, half-century or not,\" says Neil Stork-Brett. But is it the real Neil Stork-Brett? I've just been to get a glass of water and two female cleaners were having a rare old tear-up. \"You have a problem with me? Eff off!\" said one, while the other fixed her up and down with wonderful contempt and said \"Look at you!\" The new Guardian offices, ladies and gentlemen, where creativity and happiness walk hand-in-hand. Down the stairs, out the door and down the road as fast as possible to the nearest pub. All logic says you give the new ball to your swing bowler, but logic doesn't come into things when Virender Sehwag is at the crease. I'd start with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff and bully him with very well-directed rib music from the start. Because if he gets to 30, it's over. Even if they want to open with Anderson, I'd give Flintoff the new ball ahead of Harmison as this is truly a special case. 1st over: India 2-0 (Gambhir 1, Sehwag 1) Harmison starts to Gambhir with two slips, a gully, a leg-gully and the inevitable first ball down the leg side. The third ball is turned on the bounce to the left of Swann at leg-gully, and Gambhir takes a single. Sehwag's field is fairly conventional - Hussain prescribed a catcher on the fence at backward point - but he is beaten by his first delivery, a shortish awayswinger. Then he gets off the mark with a tuck to leg. Decent first over from Harmison. \"Fair call that Panesar isn't called Monty any more because he's no longer much good,\" says Steve Baldock, \"but does that mean we should call Strauss Andy?\" Yes. In fact it all makes sense now, particularly the fact that for my entire life the only person who has called me Rob rather than Smyth is my mother. And I always thought the 'Oh yes, Smyth, yes Smyth' pillow talk was a bit peculiar. 2nd over: India 3-0 (Gambhir 1, Sehwag 1) It's Jimmy Anderson at the other end. This is a massive series for Anderson: there was a lot of hype about his performances last summer, but I've never been convinced that he can do it outside England on a consistent basis. In 10 overseas Tests, he averages 51.13. His length is immediately on the short side of good to Sehwag: I think this is the right tactic, don't get me wrong, but if you're not going to pitch it up why wouldn't you have Flintoff on before Sehwag gets that extraordinary eye of his in? It's a decent first over, however. 3rd over: India 7-0 (Gambhir 1, Sehwag 5) There is a perception that the subcontinent is Harmison's worst nightmare, but he's actually put in some very worthy, zesty shifts here - note the economy rate of 2.72 - and has struggled in Africa and Australasia. He is working up a decent pace - high 80s - and getting some real bounce: Matt Prior took one length ball high above his head. But so far he hasn't made Sehwag play enough; just one out of six in that over, which Sehwag edges low through the slips for four. 4th over: India 12-0 (Gambhir 6, Sehwag 5) Gambhir makes it back-to-back boundaries by edging the first ball of Anderson's over low between second slip and gully for four. Anderson is bowling very short here, or at least the short side of full, and while it's something he's done increasingly since he was Cooleyed you can't help but think that Flintoff would do it a lot better at a time when it's so important to take an early wicket. He has, however, bowled with good discipline so far. \"From memory 'I' was a lot farking funnier,\" says possibly the real Neil Stork-Brett. \"Amateur.\" 5th over: India 12-0 (Gambhir 6, Sehwag 5) Harmison gives Gambhir very little to work with in that over, which is a maiden. Again, though, he probably didn't make him play enough: two balls I think. \"Never mind Prior's red ink,\" says Michael Abbott. \"Bell, Pietersen, Collingwood, Flintoff. 185 balls. 48 runs.\" That middle order is like the Cole-Gerrard-Lampard-Beckham England midfield: they've had their day, and too much water has gone under the bridge for that exact collection of players to ever thrive together. They need an injection of a WalSHAHcott, or a CaSHAHrrick. WICKET! India 16-1 (Sehwag b Anderson 9) Gone! This a huge wicket. The ball after striking Anderson through mid-off for four, Sehwag tried to cut one that came back a fair way and cramped him for room, rattling into the stumps off the bottom-edge. It's a frankly absurd shot, that - it was on off and middle by the time he played at it - but England won't give a rat's one about that. I told you they should have bowled Flintoff! 6th over: India 16-1 (Gambhir 6, Dravid 0) The new batsman, Rahul Dravid, is in dreadful form, so England have a real opening here. Anderson has him weaving out the way of a sharp bouncer third ball. Excellent stuff. \"In fairness to the cleaners you mentioned earlier,\" says Ian Copestake, \"they might just have been taking a moment to practise their lines for their roles in a new David Mamet play.\" 7th over: India 19-1 (Gambhir 9, Dravid 0) Gambhir cover-drives Harmison pleasantly for a couple, and Harmison winces in his follow-through from the next ball. It doesn't look to be anything too serious, and he is able to finish the over, but he was grimacing after each delivery. The last one kicks outside off to beat a crooked poke from Dravid. England have bowled with really good accuracy so far. \"Hard to credit that a batsman with a talent like Sehwag's seems to play by numbers at times,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Premeditating a reverse sweep against spin has its place in all forms of the game, but premeditating cuts from a baseball slugger's stance against genuine quicks is never a good idea. He did this more than once vs Aus recently.\" 8th over: India 23-1 (Gambhir 13, Dravid 0) Harmison has left the field - when there's any more news, you'll read it here twelfth - but in the meantime it's Anderson to Gambhir. He switches to around the wicket mid-over but still (sorry to bang on about this) doesn't make the batsman play quite enough. Then again, when he does, Gambhir whirls a cut stroke for four. It's an excellent contest, this. \"Rob,\" says Ben Dickinson, \"are you absolutely sure the cleaning ladies were talking to each other and not you?\" I wondered why she was looking at me. I just presumed she had a dodgy eye. I only asked her to shine my goddamn moccasins! 9th over: India 25-1 (Gambhir 13, Dravid 1) Flintoff replaces the injured Harmison, although he probably would have done so anyway, certainly after one more over. His first ball is an absolute peach: a snarling off-cutter that beats Dravid's nervous push. That's the highlight of a very purposeful over, tarnished only by a leg-stump no-ball that enables Dravid to get off the mark. 10th over: India 28-1 (Gambhir 15, Dravid 2) Gambhir tucks Anderson off the hip for a couple. He's been cool and patient so far. \"Chris Lewis was the last English player to get a century in Chennai? In a Test?\" says Rachel Clifton. \"Really?\" Wasn't that England's last Test on this ground, though? He certainly smacked the bowlers around that day, reaching his maiden Test hundred with the most exquisite straight six, although it was a bit of a cheap innings as England were well in the brown and already consigned to defeat when he played it. That innings might have made him a hero in a different context. Footnote: I've just realised he was actually charged with smuggling cocaine, thus tarnishing an already feeble and pathetic attempt at humour. 11th over: India 28-1 (Gambhir 15, Dravid 2) Dravid has lost his off stump and is groping at everything. Flintoff's working him over nicely - not quite Hayden at Old Trafford in 2005, but still very good - and beats him twice in that over. This is a huge little spell because, at some point in this series, Dravid will surely come back into form. England need to postpone that for as long as possible, in addition to the obvious immediate benefit of taking a second wicket early on in the innings. \"We've already seen Kumble and Ganguly retire recently but that still leaves the question of when Dravid and Tendulkar go,\" says Chris Wright. \"Can you imagine anyone ever dropping those guys, particularly Tendulkar? And does anyone know if India has quality in the ranks ready to take their place?\" They have some very handy young players, not least Rohit Sharma, but their USP will surely shift to their remarkable collection of fast bowlers. I don't think it will affect them anywhere near as much as the loss of McGrath, Warne and Gilchrist has Australia. 12th over: India 28-1 (Gambhir 15, Dravid 2) Anderson keeps on probing, on a length and now back over the wicket to Gambhir. But Gambhir, sensing that this is a) a decent spell from England's fastest bowler and b) probably Anderson's last over is happy to block. It's a maiden, and Anderson's figures are 6-2-16-1. He's bowled pretty well. In other news, here's part one in a very short series called Things That Make You Love Victoria Pendleton Even More: her favourite album is The Bends. 13th over: India 30-1 (Gambhir 15, Dravid 3) Dravid plays tip-and-run against Flintoff to get off strike, with the relief of a man who has been forced to do a stop-and-chat in an elevator and has finally reached his destination. Then Gambhir essays a brilliant/preposterous leave to a ball from around the wicket that misses the off stump by this much. \"From what I remember of that Lewis innings, he cut finely from the moment he crossed the white line,\" says Eamonn Maloney, laughing so hard at his own joke that he pulls a muscle and then accidentally beheads himself. \"No cracks in his armour that day.\" WICKET! India 34-2 (Gambhir LBW b Swann 19) What a start for Graeme Swann, who strikes with his third ball in Test cricket. His first ball was cut for four, the second produced an enormous appeal for a catch at short leg, and the third, going on with the arm and hitting the pad as Gambhir offered no stroke, was given out by Daryl Harper. It was a tight call, and you suspect Harper might have been influenced by the size of England's appeal to the previous ball, but in fairness Hawkeye had it hitting the top of off stump. What a massive wicket that is, and what a moment for Swann, finally making his Test debut almost nine years after his ODI debut. WICKET! India 37-3 (Dravid LBW b Swann 3) This is extraordinary! Graeme Swann has become the first (retrospective note: we stole this stat from Sky, and Sky got it wrong. In fact Swann was the second man to do this - see above) man to ever take two wickets in his first over in Test cricket! Dravid was beaten by a delivery that turned really sharply from outside off stump to hit the pad. It was another very tight call - might just have been outside the line, might have been too high - but Daryl Harper said yes and Hawkeye had it hitting the top of leg stump. It's very brave umpiring, especially as Harper has had a lot of stick in recent times, but he was backed up in both cases by Hawkeye. Swann's band, Dr Comfort and the Lurid Revelations, only do covers at the moment, but I'm sure he'll be penning a wee number about this in the near future. It's remarkable stuff. 14th over: India 37-3 (Tendulkar 3) That was the last ball before tea, and I need a lie down. Andy Bull will be with you in 15 minutes. TEA Well things have taken a twist towards the ludicrous all of the sudden. If you're wondering whether something is up in the Indian camp, have a look at Dileep's piece on the mental aftermath of the Mumbai attacks. A great insight from Nasser about the need to pressurise umpires with vociferous appeals. He makes no apologies for it either. To paraphrase: Daryl Harper will be thinking, and thinking about whether he can give that out, so if you keep appealing you're only going to encourage him to make the decision. And then comes probably the silliest question Ian Ward will ever pose: \"What do you think Dominic? Was Swann over the top?\" Unsurprisingly, the answer is no. 15th over: India 37-3 (Tendulkar 3 Laxman 0) So before we get too carried away, we've Laxman and Tendulkar together at the crease now. 35 overs till the close and what an absolute joy this is going to be to follow. Flintoff opens the attack, with three slips, a gully and a short leg in place. Tendulkar, with all the time in the world, eases the first two balls away either side of the wicket. Will Flintoff try a short-pitched attack? Not yet he won't. I'm expecting a crowing email from Gary Naylor any moment now, reminding me of the fact that he has been calling for Swann to be included ever since the Sri Lanka tour of last winter. 16th over: India 46-3 (Tendulkar 9 Laxman 3) Swann continues, and Laxman pops up onto his toes and flicks two runs away behind square. And that's the riposte from Tendulkar! I've been in this game for 20 years son, you think your debut over means much to me? He drops to one knee and lofts a sweep over mid-wicket for six. A clean, crisp hit into the stands that has Swann standing and staring at the disappearing ball. A clear rebuke that, from Tendulkar, as he's rarely so aggressive this early in an innings these days. Pietersen responds by putting a man back on the boundary. 17th over: India 55-3 (Tendulkar 10 Laxman 9) Laxman leans on a late cut, as though he were a dandy striking a pose with an umbrella, and runs the ball away for two to third man. And here is the indomitable Naylor, gracious enough not to brag, \"Swann is a kind of anti-Bell isn't he - almost too much assertiveness for Test cricket? But, as SK Warne, Murali and Abdul Qadir showed repeatedly, spinners can get wickets through the force of their personalities. Monty needs to vary that element of his game - loveable eccentric only gets you so far - as much as he needs to vary his flight and pace.\" The crowd in the Chidambaram are going absolutely beserk. What a treat, is there a better batsman to watch anywhere in the world than VVS? He wafts away an on-drive for four to finish the over. \"Cricket's really good\" says Bumble. I think we all know what he means. 18th over: India 56-3 (Tendulkar 11 Laxman 9) Swann continues, Laxman is cagey. 19th over: India 58-3 (Tendulkar 12 Laxman 9) Ahha, someone at Sky shot their bolt. It turns out there has been another bowler to take two Test wickets in his first over: the mighty mighty Richard 'no knees' Johnson against Zimbabwe. Legends both. Pietersen brings on Harmison, and if Flintoff didn't deploy the bouncer, Harmison does. Three times in short succession. Tendulkar drops underneath the first one but misjudges the bounce and ends up wearing the ball on his back. A single puts Laxman on strike and he sways away from the second, and slips aside from the third with a nod of his head. 20th over: India 62-3 (Tendulkar 12 Laxman 13) Laxman strides out to greet a ball on off stump from Swann and whisks it away through mid-wicket for four. \"Does Graham Swann look like a young Father Jack from Father Ted in that picture?\" asks Steve Phipps. Yes. Yes he does. 21st over: India 63-3 (Tendulkar 13 Laxman 14) Tendulkar springs up and dabs Harmison's latest short ball away to leg for a single. The response, delivered to Laxman, is a fierce bouncer and again the batsman sways underneath. Harmison's line drifts wider, and Laxman plays a pair of sublime cuts which skip straight to point and so bring him nothing in return. If the judges were giving marks for artisitc merit though... 22nd over: India 66-3 (Tendulkar 13 Laxman 14) \"Swann also looks not unlike a drunken Tuffers squaring up and about to tell someone to \"eff off\"\" points out Paddy Murphy, before adding \"So, quite like Father Jack indeed.\" 23rd over: India 75-3 (Tendulkar 24 Laxman 15) On the balcony, Dravid sits, frowning at a book which he clearly can't concentrate on. The press will be calling for his head unless he comes good in the second innings, amazing as it may seem given his record. What a shot! Tendulkar thrashes four through cover. He repeats the shot, and snicks it slightly finer through long leg for four more. It looks damn hot out there, and Harmison is getting very red in the face. I imagine we'll soon see Monty come into the attack. 24th over: India 77-3 (Tendulkar 25 Laxman 16) No sooner written than done, Monty hands his sunhat to the umpires and paces out his run. Tendulkar plays a leg glance to the first ball, and takes one. 25th over: India 81-3 (Tendulkar 25 Laxman 20) And at the other end, on comes Jimmy Anderson. Laxman thrusts out his arms and opens the face of the bat to glide the ball through the slips for four. 26th over: India 82-3 (Tendulkar 25 Laxman 20) Tendulkar pushes a single back past Monty's right hand and away to mid-on. Otherwise it is a quiet over, the intensity has just slackened off a little now, as these two master batsmen play their way away from trouble and towards a fifty partnership. 27th over: India 86-3 (Tendulkar 27 Laxman 23) Laxman waves his wand and flicks two out to deep midwicket. \"That's not Swann, or Tuffers. It's one of Smyth's cleaners from the mid-innings break...\" emails Luke Williams. 28th over: India 86-3 (Tendulkar 27 Laxman 23) An appeal from Monty, but an unconvincing one. He's not settled into his rhythm yet, unsurprising given how little cricket he has had. 29th over: India 88-3 (Tendulkar 28 Laxman 24) A single raises that fifty partnership and then a bouncer from Anderson sails high over Laxman's head. This is beginning to feel decidedly ominous for England. Tednulkar, like Magnus Magnusson tends to be the kind of man who finishes what he starts, and he's got a start here. Anderson isn't conceding anything yet though, and pings him on the hand with a sharp bouncer. 30th over: India 97-3 (Tendulkar 36 Laxman 24) England are grumbling about the ball and the umpires are busily stuffing it through metal hoops to see if it is out of shape or not. While we're waiting... a drum roll please for Dave Bell... \"Does Graham Swann have a cygnet-ure delivery? Honk!\" 'Swann on song' for the backpage headlines anyone? Blow me what a stroke that is, a cut that would have felled a redwood from Tendulkar, and the ball disappears over the rope at point. Oh my. And that's a delightful cover drive. The poise is astonishing. \"Classical batsmanship\" purrs Atherton. 31st over: India 97-3 (Tendulkar 36 Laxman 24) My brain is glazing over. \"Please forgive my curiosity,\" begind Ben Mimmack, \"but what do you do for the afternoon session when Smyth takes over. Do you have an extra cleaning job to help pay the bills?\" Oh you know, I sit and stare at the screen, or lie on a sofa and stare at the ceiling while the cleaner bumps his hoover up against my chair leg. Or I walk over the road and stare at the night attendant in the BP Garage until he tells me to go away. Ridiculously, England are complaining about the ball again, and the umpires have again agreed to change it for another. WICKET! Laxman 24 c &amp; b Panesar (32nd over: India 102-4 (Tendulkar 36 Yuvraj 4) Monty strikes! With a return catch off his own bowling! It was a straight drive from Laxman, and Monty leant out to his left and took it in both hands. The crowd are dumbstruck, as are the players, and the umpires. No one can quite believe it. Monty doesn't even celebrate because he is so bamboozled by his own prowess. Well. Yuvraj is in, and off the mark with a flick for four through mid-wicket. WICKET! Tendulkar 36 c&amp;b Flintoff (33rd over: India 102-5 (Yuvraj 4 Dhoni 1) This is just bizarre. Tendulkar falls to the very first ball of Flintoff's first over back, in identical fashion to Laxman - patting back an return catch to the bowler. Again, the players are so dumbfounded by the simplicity of the error and the ease of the wicket that it takes them some time to register what's happened. I suppose he was undone by the fact it was a slower ball, really it was just a loosener. The crowd is quiet now, except for the Barmy Army that is, who are treating everyone to a loud rendition of Super-Fred. 34th over: India 103-5 (Yuvraj 4 Dhoni 2) Stop press: the near-peerless Gideon Haigh has just put up a piece on the blog site about Shane Warne: The Musical. Go on, have a look, what else were you planning to do with the next five minutes of your life? 35th over: India 105-5 (Yuvraj 4 Dhoni 2) Steve Baldock writes: \"Swann and Crowe are both Test cricketers and misspelled bird names\" blimey, steady on that's a rare piece of insight that is, \"Are there any bird-name-cricketers who've got the spelling right? Neil Owl rings a bell from the 1930's.\". Neil Owl? This is a joke right? You'll have to do better than that Steve. Try John J Jaffray Mallard instead. 36th over: India 111-5 (Yuvraj 4 Dhoni 7) Dhoni collects five courtesy of a an overthrow from Swann. Robin Smith has written in to point out that Robin Smith should top any bird/cricketer crossover list. He also nominates Umar Gul. 37th over: India 112-5 (Yuvraj 4 Dhoni 8) 1,057 emails all containing exactly the same two-word name have just simultaneously - yes, simultaneously - dropped into my inbox. See if you can guess what the two words are. 38th over: India 121-5 (Yuvraj 8 Dhoni 13) Neither Pat Pocock nor Fred Titmouse counts, people. And as for Danish Kaneria... Panesar is still on, and Dhoni has slotted his first ball of the over through long-on for an emphatic four. England's lead is 199, though that's trimmed by four more as Yuvraj threads a cover drive through the off side. 39th over: India 123-5 (Yuvraj 9 Dhoni 14) Well, another 1,057 emails arrived guessing at that two-word name, but only one of them got it right. Well done Henry Aldridge. Of course, it was Rowan Grebe. I can't believe the rest of you thought it was Dickie Bird. 40th over: India 125-5 (Yuvraj 11 Dhoni 15) I cannot believe that two of you lot have actually offered up 'Graham Goose'. It's enough to make you weep. This used to be a classy blog you know. Not some goddamned cheap pun popsicle stand. Swann is back on now. And still they come: \"Wayne Larkins\" and \"Virender Sehwag-tail\" eh? Bloody bird puns. It's come to this has it? 41st over: India 128-5 (Yuvraj 13 Dhoni 15) My brain hurts. And it's your damn bird puns that have done it. Fred is also flagging here, though he does rouse himself for an appeal for caught behind off Yuvraj. 42nd over: India 136-5 (Yuvraj 13 Dhoni 23) A chap named Torquil Arbuthnot - from The Chap magazine no less - has points out that there was once a Lancashire cricketer named Albert Ross. And indeed there was. If you're still thinking about that one, I suggest you go outside for some fresh air. Back on the field of play, Dhoni has thumped a pair of boundaries off Swann, sending one through cover and another through long-on. WICKET! Yuvraj 14 c Flintoff b Harmison (43rd over: India 149-6 (Dhoni 23 Harbhajan 8) Harmison is coming back into the attack. And he's got Yuvraj! Caught at slip! England have been working him over for the last twenty minutes, with Flintoff marching down the wicket and staring him down during his spell, and now Harmison has undone him. The ball was sliding across the stumps, and Yuvraj tried to drive the ball through long-on, but instead sliced an edge through to second slip. Typical Harmison though - the next ball runs for four leg byes, and the one after is straight-driven for four through long-off by Harbhajan, an exquisite shot to get off the mark. He chops the next ball past gully for yet another boundary, and that's 13 from the over. 44th over: India 155-6 (Dhoni 24 Harbhajan 12) This looks to be the last over, so, without due credit I'll just say: Mark Waugh-bler and Steve Waugh-bler. Gordon Greenfinch. Graeme Chick. Bruce French-hen. Lord Hawke, Neil Hawke, Robin Singh, James Sparrow, Guy Sparrow, Adolphus Sparrow, Joel Big Bird Graner, Jeremy Snipe, Alan Knott, Douglas Jardine's parrot, George Duckworth, Peter Pridgeon, Chris Martin, Damien Martyn, RWV Robbins, Jon Snow(bunting), Hansie Crown-je, John Woodcock. You know who you are. That's more than enopugh of that. Well England are brilliant again then. Almost every prediction about this series made by me and every other pundit looks as though it could be totally wrong. A fantastic bowling performance by England, an appalling one by us on the OBO. I'm done, gone, off. Thanks for your emails, puns and company, see you tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
