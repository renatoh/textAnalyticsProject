This meant delaying the game until such a time where we can solve these logistic issues.\u201d Video game usage has exploded during the widespread social isolation enforcement, with online gaming services often struggling to meet demand. And with about 80% of game sales now coming via digital download, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association, it had seemed that the sector was coronavirus-proof. However, blockbuster video game titles like The Last of Us II still tend to sell more copies in physical rather than digital form; often because mainstream audiences are less experienced with online purchasing, or because purchasers take advantage of pre-order offers and discounts from shops and supermarkets. The most successful game in the UK in 2018, Fifa 19, achieved 75% of its sales from the physical product rather than through digital downloads. What the delay of The Last of Us Part II shows is that the closure of stores and the disruption to the manufacturing and distribution pipeline for physical software products is still problematic for the games industry. \u201cThe Last of Us II, by all accounts and appearances, looks to be finished, so this is a commercial decision,\u201d said Seth Barton, editor of industry news publication MCV/Develop. \u201cSony is concerned that the crisis will stymie the launch of its flagship title for the year. Bricks and mortar retail still makes up a considerable part of the sales mix, especially for the biggest titles, and with every Game Digital store in the UK and every GameStop in the US closed, launching a really big game right now is going to cost you. There\u2019s also the possibility that the crisis has delayed production and shipping of high-margin collector\u2019s editions of the game.\u201d And if The Last of Us Part II has fallen victim to the uncertainty and disruption around Covid-19, it\u2019s likely other major releases will follow. Titles such as Ghost of Tsushima and Cyberpunk 2077, which were also due for release in the next few months, may also be affected \u2013 if not by sales and manufacturing channels then by disruption to the development process itself. \u201cWhile big games have long been created by teams in distributed locations, having your individual staff all working from home is far from ideal,\u201d says Barton. \u201cThe process of bringing a big game to fruition is a complex one, and certain elements, such as performance capture, motion capture and [quality assurance] will be very hard to relocate out of dedicated spaces. \u201cQA is a particular bugbear, especially given the industry\u2019s penchant for incredible secrecy and round-the-clock shifts approaching launch. Sending test kits and code to testers\u2019 homes looks both practically difficult and potentially risky.\u201d Game developer Will Luton, who now runs consultancy Department of Play, reiterates the difficulties that Covid-19 brings to games testing. \u201cFor consoles, people need access to developer test kits. Often there are fewer than needed and they are shared around in a studio, with QA departments using rolling shifts for 24-hour coverage. So getting these into the homes and set up for the right people at the right time will be a logistics challenge, especially considering that technically these kits need to be kept securely in one building.\u201d This winter was also set to host two major console launches: the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. But, given the reliance on complex manufacturing and distribution channels and the need to get tens of thousands of units into both digital and physical stores, might we see Microsoft and Sony rethinking the schedule? \u201cThat depends on China\u2019s ability to control the virus, specifically in Shenzhen, the world\u2019s electronics factory, as there\u2019s nowhere else you can realistically move production,\u201d says Barton. \u201cIn addition, component supplies may be impacted, though the initial slowdown there generally seems to have picked back up.\u201d Luton also points to the security issues of having staff working from home while developing and testing PS5 and Xbox Series X titles. \u201cI would imagine Sony and Microsoft would be reluctant for their next-gen hardware to be in some private residence and they certainly wouldn\u2019t want to ship one there. But they\u2019ll have to change policy as the lockdown continues.\u201d The one positive factor is that digital channels are there if needed. \u201cOptical media manufacture is going to falter as supply chain is disrupted and bricks and mortar retail has completely disappeared,\u201d says Luton. \u201cWhile people are spending more money and time on games, a big chunk of the sales channel has just disappeared. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some AAA games now attempt a digital-only release as some of the Hollywood blockbusters have tried with a \u2018straight-to-streaming\u2019 approach. But it\u2019s a massive unknown.\u201d There\u2019s also the fact that key titles such as The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk are both set to launch on current generation consoles as well as the PC \u2013 so there is a lot of hardware out there that can already play these games. \u201cThankfully, this is the most resilient console market we\u2019ve ever had. The new consoles could be delayed into 2021 and we\u2019d still \u2013 Covid-19 permitting \u2013 be able to play all this winter\u2019s big releases on our current hardware. It pains me to say it, but we\u2019ve never needed new hardware less.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
