Andersonstown News Group managing director Mairtin O'Muilleoir said his company would not appeal against the Dublin high court's decision forbidding it to publish a new national daily using either the Ireland Today or Today titles, but described the verdict as extraordinary. \"Yes, we are changing the name, but think its unprecedented that someone who is not currently publishing a paper in Ireland should challenge someone who is,\" he said. Mr O'Muilleoir said the Belfast-based company was ploughing ahead with plans for the new Irish daily paper, which it expects to launch by the end of the year. After a meeting of senior management at a Belfast hotel this morning, he said he was working on a new title for the paper which he hoped to have secured by July 7. \"We have several names in mind, but we want to take our time deciding and make sure that all the titles are checked and not open to challenge.\" News International owns the titles Ireland Today and Today, acquiring the latter after it bought the now defunct Today newspaper in 1987 from Tiny Rowland's Lonhro group, closing the loss-making title in 1995 after rejecting an offer by Mohammed Al Fayed to buy it. A spokeswoman for News International said both Ireland Today and Today had been registered as trademarks by the company. \"This is not about the product they wanted to launch, it's simply about the trademark. Both names are registered trademarks that we own. \"We contacted them to say we owned both names and heard nothing back, so it ended up in court. It's a straightforward trademark issue,\" she said. Andersonstown News's Irish Daily is expected to be produced in tabloid format and go head to head with Belfast-based Irish News - one of Ireland's longest running dailies, first produced in 1891. The paper was forced to change its name after News UK, a subsidiary of the Murdoch-owned publisher, applied for an injunction against the company arguing that the title would breach its copyright. Andersonstown News, which owns the staunchly Republican paper of the same name in Belfast, revealed plans to launch a new paper for \"the island of Ireland\" last month and had adopted the working title of Ireland Today. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
