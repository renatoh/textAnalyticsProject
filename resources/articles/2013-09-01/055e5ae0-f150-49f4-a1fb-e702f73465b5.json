When the result of one game means your season is either dead as fried chicken or you survive a week before hobbling into the next monster mash, there is very real human emotion both sides of the fence. Sometimes in mid-season footy games, fans can be distracted. Whose shout it is, a tweet on the telephone, a bit of gum stuck on the seat in front which makes them think, \"How inconsiderate of someone, there should be a law\". But in sudden-death footy every eyeball is transfixed on every play. And for 80 minutes the world is the game. And whatever your skills when you're putting 50 on Parra or Canberra or Wests, performing in the fishbowl of death-match footy is what you're remembered for. And the players know it. And their eyes cannot betray it. Death Match I Game one? On paper, one fancies the Manly men but it's far from lay down misere. How will the Sea Eagles back up from the bruising against the Roosters? Not as well as if they'd played a team of men in puffy sumo suits, one would warrant. Last week's super-fine fixture against the Chooks was beautiful and brutal \u2013 hard-shouldered, desperate \"D\" repelling all-running attack. It was a cracking game and anyone who thinks \"tries\" are the soul arbiter of gamely goodness needs \u2026 I dunno. Not drowning. Can you say rooting? How about rogering? Regardless, Manly were punished by Roosters and will be punished again by Sharks who've been playing close to sudden-death footy for weeks. Could be close. Mystery ham-bones Two hamstrings to keep an eye on Friday night. Exhibit A: Brett Stewart's. The flying fullback's wasn't good enough for the Roosters last week. Will it have improved that much this week? Will he run free and unfettered? Will the injury lurk there in the back of his mind like a phantom and/or wraith? Let's go with Yes, Maybe, and Dunno. Meanwhile, upon the Cronulla team-sheet, veteran hard-acre and all-round man of rugby league Luke Lewis has been named in the No6 jumper, and he'll go well there because he's a ripper. But there's a little nibble of speculative moot (or something) that Shane Flanagan could Shock The World and play Todd Carney at five-eighth. They can do amazing things with hamstring repair in these modern scientific times, and Carney's group of tendons contracted by three posterior thigh muscles (semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris) will be given days of loving and deep-tissue massage to get fixed and flexible. But you still fancy Manly. Death Match II Storm and Knights? Again, it all points Melbourne's way: home ground, better players, better team. But Phil Gould's tipped the Knights and he knows stuff. Andrew Johns knows stuff, too, and he tipped them last week against the Dogs. They are sneaking up on this Provan-Summons Premiership statue thing, and no argument. Their Grand Jedi Master Wayne Bennett knows how to make men run and jump, and do their thing. He's a master of man-manipulation, the great Benny, and if he can't get these Knights up for this fixture then he should give it up. But he's not going to give it up. Because he will get them up for it. He knows stuff, too. Lots of stuff. Storm? Big test of their nerve. They're against a mob of madmen with nothing to lose coming good at business time. The Knights forwards have a typically Newcastle hard-man look about them: David Fa'alogo, Willie Mason, Beau Scott, Jeremy Smith, Chris Houston, Neville Costigan \u2013 these are not people you'd invite to a tea-party unless you wanted everything smashed to the sound of maniacal laughter. But you still like Storm. Cameron Smith, Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk \u2026 these are the best players in the game. And they know how to win. Straight Fijians Two men with little care for their own physical well-being will clash, literally, head-to-head in Melbourne Saturday night when Fijians Sisa Waqa (Storm) and Akuila Uate (Knights) surge out onto AAMI Park. Good players? Top players, friend: hard running, athletic, powerful types, they leap about and run straight and step hard into oncoming defences. And in the tackle they fight like feral cats in a sack. Watch them. They'll hurt each other all night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
