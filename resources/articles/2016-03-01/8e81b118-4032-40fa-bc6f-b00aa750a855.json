Each moves on their own gleaming ivory tile: they laugh hysterically, pull manic faces, weep in despair and strike dramatic poses like silly Greek statues. Potted cacti are also wheeled out. Some are round and bulbous, others oversized and phallic, each plant held aloft with hushed respect as if a rare artefact. A magnified voice, reverberating on stage, asks: \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Are the cacti a metaphor for the dancer: resilient, strong, all spiky limbs and arched backs? Do they represent the dichotomy of male and female? Or is it that out of something tough comes beauty, the eruption of bright, delicate flowers? Tempted to answer those questions? Well don\u2019t. You\u2019ll only be speared. Cacti is a prickly, often hilarious send-up of both the pompous critic and the pretentious affectations of modern dance. Drumming that home is a booming male voiceover. In dry overtones he offers his overly aggrandised, fatuous critique of the action as it unfolds. First created in 2010 by the young Swedish choreographer Alexander Ekman, this is the second time that Cacti, a raucous, riotous crowdpleaser, has been performed by the Sydney Dance Company (it was last put on in 2013). There\u2019s no doubt it is very funny, but Ekman also wants to put forward a serious point. Created early in his career, when he was first exposed to reviews by the media, it questions the system by which a chosen few decide what makes high art. For all its knowing wit, Cacti only works because of its winning choreography: large ensemble pieces are performed with both precision and panache. A central duet, featuring a dead (stuffed) cat and the less-than-kosher thoughts of a couple as they dance, is spot-on in its mix of humour and awkwardness. Like most of Cacti it treads a fine line, juggling jocular comedy with the uncomfortable notion of getting a little too close to a painful truth. It\u2019s a tough act to follow. In CounterMove \u2013 a clever umbrella title that nods to two pieces in a double bill that are utterly opposed to each other \u2013 the company\u2019s artistic director, Rafael Bonachela, unveils the world premiere of his new work, Lux Tenebris. The Latin expression translates as \u201clight in darkness\u201d. And the piece is exactly what Cacti has sent up, minutes before. Buying into the cliches of what we have come to expect from modern dance, this is all twitching legs, throbbing music, shadowy lighting and muted colours. Thanks to Bonachela it is also utterly mesmerising. Dressed in urban streetwear \u2013 shorts, T-shirts and crop tops, in dull greys and blacks \u2013 the dancers perform what could be gang fights, rearing and rising against each other, or moving apart from the crowd in solo expressions of angst. They slip in and out of pools of inky dark and sputtering light (designed masterfully by Benjamin Cisterne) often exploring the liminal, luminous space in between. The Sydney-based composer Nick Wales\u2019s insistent electronic score (his fifth collaboration with Bonachela) provides a beating urgency. Wales wanted to create a musical \u201ctug of war\u201d and, although distorted to the point of un-recognition, he has incorporated recordings of Pluto\u2019s atmosphere, South Korean monks, the buzz of beehives and crackling fireworks. Lux Tenebris ends with dancers jogging crisscross along the stage, a production line gone awol. Perhaps they are running away from the critique lampooned in Cacti. That is why, together, these two pieces \u2013 light and dark, funny and serious, satirical and utterly earnest \u2013 work so well. Just don\u2019t try and say what they mean. \u2022 CounterMove is touring major cities and regional Australia until 27 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
