Leeds are warning spectators to turn up extra early for their game against Wakefield - already a challenging 11.30am kick-off - with the Headingley capacity reduced to 16,600 as work continues on the new Carnegie Stand. The same fixture attracted 13,238 last Boxing Day and the Rhinos have picked four of their five new signings - Mark O'Neill and Scott Donald from Australia, Shane Millard from Widnes and Nathan McAvoy from Salford. Donald believes he can make a big impact at Leeds. \"With the quality players we have here, I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to show what I can do on the wing,\" Donald said. \"I can feel myself settling in and really being happy here.\" The Rhinos have also included four Great Britain internationals who missed out on this year's Tri-Nations series. Danny McGuire is fit again after the groin surgery that ruled him out and the front-row trio of Ryan Bailey, Danny Ward and Matt Diskin will be anxious to make an early impression with much to prove next year. Millard's arrival provides a potential threat to Diskin at hooker, although the versatile Australian will start at loose forward. However the biggest single draw in the Boxing Day programme is across the Pennines at Widnes, where David Peachey will make his debut for the Vikings against a Warrington team including his former Cronulla team-mate Michael Sullivan. Peachey has been one of the world's most exciting attacking full-backs for the best part of a decade, making his willingness to join Widnes despite their relegation to the National League a major surprise. \"He left a 40 degree heatwave in Australia and when he landed at Manchester I think it was minus three,\" Widnes's new coach Steve McCormack says of his star signing. \"A lot of people could start whingeing but he's been superb.\" Terry Matterson, another Australian who has been appointed coach for Castleford's return to the Super League, admits he is slightly bewildered to start with a derby against Featherstone six weeks before the serious business begins. \"It's the wrong time for us to be playing but I'm told it's a bit of a tradition,\" said the former Brisbane and London Broncos loose forward. \"There's a bit of a duty to the fans but I'm really focusing on our first Super League game.\" The programme is completed by Dewsbury and Batley, with the Rams aiming to take a small measure of revenge after being denied promotion to National League One by their Heavy Woollen rivals in October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
