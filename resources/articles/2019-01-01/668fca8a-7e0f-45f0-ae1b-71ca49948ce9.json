Why this, now? Probably because of the rise in populism and the cult of personality in politics, which collide with such magnetic force in the polarising figure of Ch\u00e1vez. Of course there\u2019s a world of difference between the populism of the left and the right, which is what we\u2019re seeing in Brazil, Hungary, the US and the endless chaos of Brexit. What\u2019s so appalling is the outcome is often the same: the slippery slope to authoritarianism, corruption and abject poverty. Venezuela is now a country in freefall. Inflation is said to be more than 1,000,000%. People are starving to death. Childhood friend Rafael Simon Jimenez says of the president\u2019s death from cancer at the age of 58, \u201c[it] spared him from dealing with the disaster that began under his rule\u201d. But I\u2019m fast-forwarding to the end. This balanced explainer begins with the longstanding inequities in a country of 30 million people, many of whom have never benefited from Venezuela\u2019s unparalleled oil reserves. Ch\u00e1vez was one of them: the son of teachers raised in the impoverished southwestern plains. His childhood nickname was Goofy on account of being skinny with big feet. (Those who later tuned into the president\u2019s singing and dancing TV show, described by a former adviser as \u201ca variety show happening all day, every day\u201d, might have assumed it was for different reasons.) He joined the military and by 1992 was leading a coup to overthrow the government. This is when the nation first encountered the fresh-faced army officer in a red beret and fatigues on TV, a medium embraced so evangelically by Ch\u00e1vez one can\u2019t help but think of another media-obsessed leader who sprang from the small screen and is increasingly called a dictator. Before going to prison, Ch\u00e1vez asked to address the country live on TV. \u201cWe have not met our objectives \u2026 for now,\u201d he announced. It was those last two bristling words \u2013 \u201cpor ahora\u201d in Venezuelan Spanish \u2013 that seized the imagination of an entire country. In that moment Ch\u00e1vez, the charismatic comandante, socialist revolutionary and media superstar, was born. The other Ch\u00e1vez, the one drunk on power who persecuted his opponents and by 2009 was announcing his intention (live on TV, naturally) \u201cto stand for re-election, indefinitely\u201d, comes later. First we get the shock 56% win four years out of prison, the defiant world tour which, one commentator recalls, \u201cfelt like an ABC of US enemies\u201d, and the governing by reality TV. How often is a head of state\u2019s makeup artist one of the main talking heads on a political documentary? \u201cHe was funny and you hung on everything he said,\u201d recalls Eva Golinger, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s foreign policy adviser from 2004-13. Later, she tells a chilling story. Interviewing him in private, Golinger asked Ch\u00e1vez a question that \u201cset him off\u201d. Ch\u00e1vez turned off the tape. \u201cHe said: \u2018My neck is sore. Do you give massages?\u2019 I thought, my time here is up.\u201d His charisma and sheer audacity could be electrifying. When referring to President George W Bush in a UN address, Ch\u00e1vez said: \u201cYesterday the devil came here and it still smells of sulphur.\u201d Socialists call this Latin America\u2019s golden decade, when Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina all elected leftwing populist presidents. But \u201cthe dark side of Ch\u00e1vez\u201d, as Margarita Lopez Maya of the Central University of Venezuela calls it, was there in his ruthless pursuit of enemies, addiction to power and capacity to spend trillions of dollars in oil revenues without helping the poor he vowed to champion. Ch\u00e1vez spent more on his final election campaign, when the country knew he was dying and elected him anyway, than either Obama or Trump. This may be a documentary about a man leading a specific revolution, but it\u2019s also, unfortunately, a story as old as civilisation: how power corrupts men, idealism gets warped, and the cult of personality ends up a one-way track to megalomania. And yet we seem incapable of changing the script. Told you. Deeply depressing. So yes, this may be the last documentary you can face watching right now. But that probably means you should watch it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
