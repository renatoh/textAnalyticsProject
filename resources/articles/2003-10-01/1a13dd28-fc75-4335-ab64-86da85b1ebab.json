Stinson, from Fordingbridge in Hampshire, is one of the growing number of people in the UK who are using online marketplace giant eBay to transform their finances. 'It has always been a dream of mine to be a millionaire,' he says. But it is only since he started buying and selling records, CDs and posters on eBay in 1999 that it has become a possibility. Last year he sold 400 items a month; this year it is a thousand. Turnover runs at between \u00a36,500 and \u00a37,500 a month. It sounds easy. And with 75.3 million registered users worldwide, 16 million items on the site at any one time, and 27,000 different categories ranging from cars and building materials to rare manuscripts and doll's houses, the opportunities are enormous. But should you give up the day job and join Stinson and the estimated 10,000 people in the US now making a full-time living on eBay? Patience is the key, says Gail Wall, from Billingham in Cleveland, who began trading 'around three years ago' while working in accounts. It was after a year trading in collectibles such as Royal Doulton and Brambly Hedge that she decided to risk going part-time in her job at a food testing company. Now she is planning the next stage. 'I am going to go full-time working for myself next year,' she says. Although the costs of getting a business up and running are comparatively low, there will be some expenses, says Wall. These include a computer and a digital cam era, used to advertise the products online. 'The initial outlay can be \u00a32,000 or \u00a33,000 for your equipment,' she says. Events outside your control can reduce your income. Like others who sell to America, when that attacks of September 11 happened, she found that sales plummeted. 'You could get a world crisis again, and if you are selling to people abroad you run the risk of having no earnings, so it is always good to keep a little back to pay the mortgage.' George Crudgington, and his partner Joyce Bailey, self-described 'mature citizens' from North Derbyshire, became involved with eBay in 1997. 'We started up because, like a lot of people of our age, we found we were in the trap of little savings and very poor job prospects,' he says. It all started with just a few first-day covers of Princess Diana, which 'we found we could sell very easily'. His next interest, toy soldiers, also found a receptive market. Soon Joyce, who had been made redundant, joined in. 'I said to her: \"Rather than work for a menial \u00a34.50 an hour, why don't you come into the business?\"' It hasn't all been plain sailing, says Crudgington. 'The biggest problem is convincing banks that this is a serious business.' Initially they were reluctant to provide bank accounts. It was also difficult to get suppliers 'to take the internet seriously'. If you get a lot of your stock from car-boot sales, your income can fluctuate, warns Wall. In the winter when there are fewer 'you halve your earnings'. Concerns have been raised about fraud. However, Stinson says that eBay is constantly tightening security. 'We have found it very safe,' he says. And eBay points out that fewer than one in 10,000 transactions involves fraud. George Bromley, from Cleethorpes, who sells motivational material, warns of the importance of observing eBay's rules. If you don't, you risk suspension and 'you have no auction business'. However, for Crudgington it has been onwards and upwards. 'We hit \u00a325,000 turnover in our first year,' he says. Now it is in six figures. One of the best things they bought was a bronze of a Japanese archer, he says. It cost them $74, but has been valued at 'at least \u00a33,500'. The couple have moved to a new house, and 'can afford to consider buying a house in France ... instead of trying to exist on a poor state pension'. Anyone can do it, says Crudgington. 'Choose an area where you have some sort of interest, and dip your toe in slowly. If you like it, I would guess that in about 12-18 months you could give up your job.' For most 'eBayers' that remains an unlikely scenario. Unlike her neighbour, Gail Wall, Yvonne Kane, also from Billingham, uses it to get rid of unwanted household items. 'I am basically trying to create some space by de-cluttering the garage and attic,' she says. But as others have found, you never know where it might lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
