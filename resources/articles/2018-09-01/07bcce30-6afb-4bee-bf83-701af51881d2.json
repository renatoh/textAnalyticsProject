Baby monitors are a common way to go about it. This is a particularly lovely example of it, though, delivered not via baby monitor, but over police radio. Maybe lovely isn\u2019t the right word. Hilarious is better. Detectives Hendy and Stokes are in a squad car on a long stakeout \u2013 that\u2019s the central premise of BBC Two\u2019s No Activity \u2013 and, as you might guess from the title, they are not that busy. They have just radio-met April, the new officer in the control room, and played a mean trick on her: pretending to be under attack from armed hoodlums, and requiring urgent backup, then getting shot. \u201cShe sounds nice, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d says Stokes afterwards, playing Cupid (again) with his single partner/best mate. Hendy says he doesn\u2019t want a nice April, he wants a filthy April, and he sets off on one about exactly what kind of April he would like (Parisian, with a bit of medieval) and what he would like to do with her (a lot). He is getting more and more carried away with the fantasy and even starts acting it out. Stokes joins in until Carol, April\u2019s deadpan boss in dispatch, finally interrupts: \u201cCar 72, you\u2019re still on.\u201d Stokes had the button resting against his thigh \u2026 Better than \u201cGod, I hate so-and-so\u201d over the baby monitor at a dinner party, no? Because it pushes the same thing a little further, into a riskier \u2013 and more risque \u2013 territory. And No Activity, the first comedy on Aussie streaming service Stan, does that \u2013 it bumbles along. There\u2019s not much going on \u2013 it is just a couple of mates on the job, blokey banter, and then suddenly they\u2019ll go a little bit further. Some will probably say they go too far. Before the April thing, they were wondering, if you were a Siamese twin (not conjoined, note), which hand you would masturbate with. The one connected with your head? Or would you use the other one, because then it would be like it was someone else? And would you have to ask the other head\u2019s permission if you wanted to use their arm: \u201cWould you mind jerking us off\u201d \u2026 and, suddenly, there are all sorts of ethical and philosophical issues on the subject for them to discuss. It\u2019s bloody funny. And also utterly believable. If you were stuck doing nothing for a long time with someone with whom you got along pretty well \u2013 even if, at times, you irritated the crap out of each other \u2013 you would, eventually, get around to the conjoined self-pleasure debate. You have probably had it already. Here are a few other things I like about No Activity: 1. Hendy\u2019s sarcasm. \u201cOh, then something really weird happened?\u201d he says, when Stokes, halfway through a story that\u2019s already really weird, about an encounter he had with an old man in a hot tub, says that then something really weird happened. 2. The concrete dolphin on the back seat of the car. \u201cWhat dolphin?\u201d says Stokes, sarkily. 3. Carol\u2019s world-weariness and unpredictability. 4. April\u2019s secret (it comes out in episode two, that she killed a man. April\u2019s a dark horse). 5. The bit where Carol tells April: \u201cAssaulting a horse is assaulting a member of the police force.\u201d 6. How Stokes plans to get rid of the Black Dog that has wife, Wendy, by the throat \u2013 by giving her a child. 7. And how he won\u2019t need to reverse a vasectomy, because he never had a vasectomy, even if he does \u2013 Hendy thinks \u2013 have a \u201cvasectomy face\u201d. 8. Amusing criminal lowlifes Bruce and Jimmy, in the warehouse, being staked out, though they don\u2019t know it. 9. Jimmy also doesn\u2019t know who his father is, although he is on a mission to find out and he has narrowed it down to most of the men in Australia. 10. Activity! Bruce gets shot, by Stokes, uncharacteristically. That\u2019ll do, for now. There is a US adaptation of this, executive produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. I don\u2019t really want to see it. I like No Activity \u2013 and I think it belongs \u2013 as it is here, in Australia. Get involved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
