In a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, the groups say the move is \u201cdisproportionate and unnecessary\u201d and that the Home Office\u2019s own research has suggested that higher search rates may have no discernible crime-reducing effects. The proposal was designed to meet the Conservatives\u2019 2019 manifesto pledge to make it easier for officers to stop and search those convicted of knife crime. The government is also exploring the possibility of making it an offence to fail to cooperate with a search while subject to a serious violence reduction order (SVRO). Organisations including StopWatch, Inquest, Open Society Foundations, Liberty and a number of experts said in the letter that research shows that widening police powers further increases racial disparities in stop-and-search practices. It said: \u201cThe use of stop and search is heavily concentrated on black and minority ethnic groups \u2013 government figures show that black people are searched at 8.9 times the rate of white people. \u201cThese disparities are reproduced throughout the criminal justice system; in arrests, out-of-court disposals, prosecution and sentencing. Years of policing research tells us that when discretion in the use of police stop and search is increased, racial disparities worsen.\u201d Under existing section 60 powers to search individuals without suspicion in areas where there are fears of serious violence, research shows that black people are searched at more than 40 times the rate of white people. The proposals to introduce stop-and-search measures without reasonable suspicion would further undermine the safeguard, the letter said, after previous efforts were ruled unlawful in 2010 by the European court of human rights. The consultation on the proposals ends on Sunday. StopWatch\u2019s spokeswoman, Lucy Bryant, said: \u201cThe orders not only ignore, but run counter to a substantial body of evidence that shows stop and search has little, if any, effect on violence. Successful public health approaches provide a clear template, and yet these lessons about crime prevention and public safety have been overlooked. \u201cWhat these powers will do is perpetually criminalise those who receive them, only making it harder for them to make positive changes, locking them into the very patterns of behaviour we hope to prevent.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur proposals aim to transform the way stop and search is used by targeting the small number of the most serious and persistent criminals. \u201cThey could take more knives and those who repeatedly carry them off our streets. Extensive safeguards are in place to ensure stop and search is done fairly and proportionately.\u201d In its consultation document, it said that SVROs would give police the automatic right to search those already convicted of certain knife crime offences. \u201cThese searches could take place without suspicion so that these known criminals could be stopped at any time,\u201d the Home Office document said. \u201cSVROs would empower the police to stop and challenge those who are known to carry knives.\u201d It added that although some rates of serious violence crime had stabilised, the overall figures were too high and there had been an increase in cases involving people who have already committed one offence involving a knife or other offensive weapon. The proposals come after the Guardian revealed that the Home Office dropped plans to improve the best use of the stop-and-search scheme, which were aimed at reducing \u201cno suspicion\u201d searches, and withdrew from consultations at the end of 2017. Patel then appeared to scrap the scheme altogether after it was announced in August last year that she would \u201clift all conditions in the voluntary best use of stop-and-search scheme over the use of section 60\u201d in an attempt to crack down on violent crime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
