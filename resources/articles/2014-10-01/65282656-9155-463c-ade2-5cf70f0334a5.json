I\u2019m OK, I get on with it because that\u2019s where we are. We get on with it.\u201d Poyet feels his club ended the summer transfer window with a small squad, which has been further weakened by injuries. This week they have added the 34-year-old former Napoli full-back Anthony R\u00e9veill\u00e8re but remain without Emmanuel Giaccherini, Ricardo \u00c1lvarez, Sebasti\u00e1n Coates and Billy Jones. \u201cWhen everybody is OK, it doesn\u2019t look bad,\u201d Poyet said. \u201cUnfortunately now we have four important injuries to players who are important to the team and we are suffering, especially at the back. \u201cI knew it. I\u2019m not trying to criticise someone or the club, I just said we are short so that when things happen it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m just making excuses for what\u2019s happened. I said it before. I was just being honest. It wasn\u2019t cajoling. I wanted seven defenders and we started the season with six. I didn\u2019t make the decision to have six, but that\u2019s life \u2013 and now we have seven. \u201cWe were looking for certain players, we were looking for Fabio Borini but he didn\u2019t come. We looked for a player like him, we signed Ricky \u00c1lvarez. But is Ricky \u00c1lvarez a substitute for Fabio? No, he has never scored more than 10 goals a season. Is he going to start scoring because I\u2019m some sort of managerial genius? No. As a player he can play in that position, but he\u2019s not the same player as Fabio Borini. I\u2019m not going to lie. We didn\u2019t sign a replacement for Borini.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
