Not for a king's ransom", "bodyText": "Apart from the fact that they have both turned 65 this week and spent a good deal of their lives in uniform, John Bettley and Paul Harries have little in common with the Prince of Wales. Their years of service \u2013 in the police and the Royal Marines \u2013 are behind them, while the prince still does not know when he will be called on to stroll in the opposite direction and clamber, or perhaps shuffle, on to the throne. \"It's interesting to see how his life's gone, but I'm glad I had it the other way round,\" says Bettley, who spent 31 years as a policeman on Merseyside. \"I couldn't face the work he's got now at my age. It's great to be having all the free time but he's looking to be working for the next 30 years, if he lives that long.\" It must be horrible, he adds, to have a job that means \"waiting for your mum to die\". After working as a mounted constable, control room operator and branch steward for Unison, Bettley retired three years ago and would be embracing its joys still further were he not staring at a \u00a34,000 credit card bill after taking his grandchildren to Florida recently. In the summer, he works for the local lifeguard service, issuing permits for jetskis and powerboats to use the beach at West Kirby. With a bit of luck, one more season will see to the Florida bill. For the rest of the year, he volunteers as a deputy launching officer in the RNLI, walks his dog twice a day, and goes to the gym. He opted against settling in a place in the sun. \"I did plan on retiring to Gozo, an island off Malta, but I don't think I'd last the pace there,\" he says. \"The wine is cheaper than the water, and I tend to drink the wine \u2013 and that's not good for the liver.\" Harries, who turned 65 on Thursday, likes to joke that he and the prince were switched at birth. If they had been switched back, the heir to the throne would have found himself spending eight years with the marines in Aden, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean before working as an engineering contractor until arthritis forced him to retire five years ago. Harries now sits on the national council of the Royal Naval Association for 12 years and has been chairman of the Llanelli branch of the Royal British Legion since 2008. \"I've no big, burning ambition; I travelled round quite a bit when I was in the marines,\" he says. \"I got about a fair bit in those days and my contracting work took me all around the country \u2013 as did my work with the association.\" That said, Harries and his partner do pop abroad for holidays now and again. He met the prince in Cardiff three years ago, and reckons him to be a \"very approachable, very amenable\" man who enjoys cracking jokes. And he also believes Charles's long apprenticeship may yet serve him well. \"It works both ways. Waiting to be king can be very frustrating for him, I suppose \u2013 but at the same time, it should be easier for him because he's got all the life experiences building up to it.\" Despite their divergent lives, Harries harbours no bitterness towards the man who robbed him of his birthright. \"I'm very pleased for him and have always been a supporter,\" he says. Asked how he will celebrate his 65th year \u2013 the prince will mark the occasion with a reception at the British high commission in Colombo \u2013 Harries pauses. \"I don't really mark my birthday, but I'll probably go down the association club in town and have a few drinks with my friends.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
