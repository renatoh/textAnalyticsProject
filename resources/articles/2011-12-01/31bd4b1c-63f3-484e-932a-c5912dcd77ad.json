Brown has agreed terms on a long-term contract at Celtic, thought to be worth \u00a328,000 a week. Yet the deal remains unsigned amid a dispute between Celtic and the player's representatives relating to their fee. As of Thursday, Brown has entered the final six months of his existing contract. \"The club was due to meet his representatives on Tuesday but they had to cancel,\" Lennon said. \"I have spoken to Scott and he says there has been no contact with any other clubs. He also said he is quite happy to stay and sign a contract. \"He can talk to other clubs now and we can't stop him from doing that but I am not convinced he will. I certainly don't get the impression he is leaving. He has told me he wants to stay and we have put the contract in front of him.\" Brown has been linked with Newcastle United, although central midfield is not thought to be a priority signing area for Alan Pardew at present. \"There is just this matter of getting the problem sorted out and it has dragged its heels a little bit,\" Lennon said. \"It is not irking me but I have to keep answering questions and I want it resolved sooner rather than later. I think it will be resolved the way we want it to be.\" Lennon was not aware of a mixed reception from the stands for Brown when he returned from injury as a substitute during Wednesday night's defeat by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \"If he decides not to sign the contract, he might get an adverse reaction from some supporters,\" Celtic's manager said. \"Until that comes, I think the supporters are right behind him. \"I think we missed him at times when he was out. If you look at his playing record since I have been manager, we have won more games than not when he has been involved.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
