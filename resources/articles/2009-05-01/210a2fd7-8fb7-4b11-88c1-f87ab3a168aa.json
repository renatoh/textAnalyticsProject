It's also pretty interesting to look at the contrast because it tells you a lot about the particular challenge a manager confronts.\" In an otherwise empty boardroom at Twickenham Johnson demolishes his last mouthful and pushes aside the Rugby Football Union's plate. \"When I played you could simply feel what was happening in a game,\" he remembers with a suddenly concentrated gaze. \"You could feel if their intensity was dropping. And then that great feeling comes when you know you've got them, when you know you've broken them.\" His eyes glitter at the memory of the deadly instinct that surged through him as a player. Yet Johnson is such an intelligent and pragmatic man that he reverts quickly to the more ambivalent art of management. \"It's not that simple in the grandstands,\" he says ruefully. \"In one of my first games as England manager, against Australia last November, I thought I could see what they were feeling on the pitch. At half-time I said, 'Can you feel it? Can you feel how they've lessened their intensity?' I thought we'd reached a point where we could impose ourselves.\" At half-time England trailed Australia by a point but in the end they were beaten comprehensively \u2013 with that 28\u201314 defeat being followed by a record 42\u20136 loss to South Africa. Had his players not felt the same when he told them they were on the verge of winning their battle against Australia? \"They said they shared my view but sometimes are they just saying that because it's the thing to say? As a player it's more instinctive. You're eye-to-eye to with the opposition and you can feel whether they're weakening. I'm still learning to do that as a manager but, ultimately, you make your decisions and you have to trust your players.\" That trust is sometimes shattered. The most graphic illustration in Johnson's brief reign occurred during England's Six Nations match against Ireland. After spending the entire week preaching discipline, and with England trailing 11\u20136 late in the game, Johnson watched his substitute scrum-half, Danny Care, shove Marcus Horan in the back. As Care was sin-binned Johnson erupted in the stands. His face was thunderous as his right fist came crashing down. It looked like a punch that would have taken off little Care's head had he been in striking distance. Johnson grins at the suggestion that had he tried to maintain a managerial poker-face the top of his head might have blown off in rage. \"It just had to come out. If I'd kept it in I don't know what might have happened. As a player you can put that disappointment and aggression into the next hit \u2013 but as a coach there's nowhere to go. But I can't be stone-faced because that was a big moment in a tense game. We conceded three points to go 14\u20136 down and we lost our scrum-half. I thought, 'The game's finished now.' It was so annoying because we'd stayed with Ireland, a good team, until then. \"People say, 'I bet you don't miss all the bumps and bruises' \u2013 but I do. It's an honest feeling in the morning after a game, whether you've won or lost, to think, 'Yeah, I've put the effort in'. And that's why when a game is over a player can usually switch off. But as a manager the head keeps spinning. You can't leave it alone.\" Amid his disappointments Johnson has reverted to a more conservative selection policy \u2013 and grizzled veterans will remain the cornerstone of his future teams. \"It's key having experienced characters in your squad. We saw that in the Six Nations when some experienced guys came back \u2013 Joe Worsley, Mike Tindall, Mark Cueto \u2013 and made a huge difference. We've also got Lewis Moody and Jonny [Wilkinson]. In close Tests you need those experienced guys.\" Wilkinson and a dozen other England internationals are due to play French club rugby next season \u2013 in a move of seismic consequences for Johnson. After a tortuous battle between the RFU and the English clubs he now has unprecedented access to, and control of, his Test players. He can summon his squad two weeks before a game and impose limitations on how often they appear for their clubs. In exchange each Premiership club receives, on average, compensation of \u00a3470,000. But this deal does not cross the Channel. James Haskell, Riki Flutey, Tom Palmer, Jamie Noon, Andy Goode and Wilkinson could be excluded from Johnson's squads next season if their French clubs do not release them according to RFU stipulations. \"It's a problem,\" Johnson concedes, \"but the players were aware of our feelings before signing their contracts. For some it's been an ambition to play in France and I understand that. It might've been something I would've liked to do towards the end of my career.\" Haskell and Flutey, however, are in the formative stages of their international careers \u2013 and it seems as if they and other French-bound players do not have any release clauses in their new contracts. \"They're getting things written in,\" Johnson suggests before adding a steely reminder. \"It's important that they do because it will have a real impact on their chances of playing for England. A player who doesn't get released for training camps is still eligible to play for England but he's taking a real risk. \"I think it's wise for Rob Andrew [the RFU's elite performance director] or myself to be in touch with the French clubs to make our position clear. Hopefully in the next weeks and months we'll go see them. Andy Goode came in from Brive during the Six Nations and so we have a relationship with them.\" Brive could feature five prospective England squad members next season. And does Johnson expect fiercely ambitious clubs like Stade Fran\u00e7ais to be accommodating when they are chasing their domestic championship? \"They need to know from the outset that guys like Haskell and Palmer don't want to jeopardise their England careers. That was their opening statement when we spoke personally to both those guys about what the move might mean for them. Some of that was positive but the bottom line is that they need to train with the England squad.\" The bluntness of Johnson's approach has resulted in other casualties. The way in which Danny Cipriani appears to have fallen out of favour is another clear indication that youthful adventure will not be welcomed unless it is matched by rigorous dedication. Since his basic errors in the autumn were accompanied by the enduring accusation that he revels in the celebrity he shares with his girlfriend, Kelly Brook, Cipriani's rugby has slipped. Yet is there a danger of Cipriani being stereotyped? A man as bright and engaging as Johnson knows how media myths develop \u2013 for he was once depicted as a fearless monster who did little but glare and grunt. \"Well, Danny has a media profile and perceptions develop. It's like that one about me. Things get overblown so I don't think perceptions of Danny as this showbiz guy are entirely true. But guys must understand what they do both on and off the field is important. Are they training hard enough, are they striving to be world-class players? \"I understand the need for balance in life but we judge players on what do they do on the rugby field and, also, how they interact with the team off it. The world is tempting and they're signing lucrative contracts at a young age. That's fine but they've got to work for it. It's not just Danny Cipriani. Other guys have potential lifestyle issues and we need to say, 'Look, you can have that lifestyle \u2026 but you'll underachieve.'\" Could Cipriani be left out of England's squad to face the Barbarians at Twickenham on 30 May followed by two Tests against Argentina next month \u2013 first at Old Trafford on 6 June and then a week later in Argentina? \"Danny's got well-documented issues with his ankle and there are always guys who can benefit from rest or proper rehabilitation. But Leicester are in two finals and other players might get called up for the Lions. So we'll have to see.\" Johnson has so many immediate problems to resolve that any comparison with his most successful predecessor, Clive Woodward, is redundant. \"I'm far more pragmatic than Clive,\" Johnson says. \"He came in and said let's do 100 things 1% better. But to me those little extras, those 1% things, can only be added once the groundwork is there. With Clive it only really worked in our last few years. Before that it seemed as if they were slightly irrelevant because we still had 5-10% improvement to make on our basics. It's the same now. We've got so much to do in improving our foundation.\" England, under Johnson, have won only four out of nine matches but he argues that \"some of the newer guys like Delon Armitage and Riki Flutey played three of their first four Tests against Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In the Premiership you won't get as exposed if you make mistakes but Test rugby is a brutal place. They have to be able to stand their corner and play and so they're far better for the experience.\" Johnson exudes a candour and conviction as a manager that might yet galvanise England. Yet, being such a realist, he refuses to follow Woodward's mantra that he should be judged on the next World Cup. \"Clive said that in 1999 and he ended up struggling to save his job. I've never said judge me on anything because people will judge you anyway. I know if you lose games you're going to get criticised. So it's important we just start winning again \u2013 and I believe we will.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
