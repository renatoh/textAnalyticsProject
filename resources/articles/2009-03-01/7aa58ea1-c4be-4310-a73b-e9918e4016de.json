Tonight's attack in Craigavon's Lismore Road area, a predominantly Irish Catholic area, has come just days after Real IRA dissidents shot and killed two British soldiers at an army base in the town of Antrim. Two other soldiers and two pizza delivery men were wounded in that attack. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the latest shooting. Dissidents opposed to Northern Ireland's peace process and the Catholic-Protestant government it forged have been increasing their attacks against British security forces in recent months.
