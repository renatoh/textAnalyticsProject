We don't actually want to live under a dictatorship \u2013 we still have a horror of what that would entail \u2013 but we do envy dictators their ability to act decisively in a crisis.\u201d In a fascinating essay on the trouble with democracy, David Runciman writes a historical examination of the competing systems of political organisation. From Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s thoughts on American democracy to contemporary examples of China, Russia, and the US\u2019s recent game of chicken with the global economy, Runciman highlights democracy\u2019s ability to muddle through, versus dictatorships\u2019 power to take decisive action. From political games to linguistic ones, and a piece that will either intrigue or utterly frustrate you. In an essay on those elusive and slippery time wasters, Alan Connor celebrates 100 years of the crossword, by arguing that cryptics are easier than quicks. Connor looks at the crossword\u2019s evolution from a way to fill space in the Christmas edition of a New York newspaper in 1913, to its current, sometimes infuriatingly cryptic form. For further reading on the art of \u201cenjoying being misled,\u201d see the work of Australian setter, David Astle too. \u201cI thought, why not make it as close to my own chronology as possible? If you don\u2019t know the area it won\u2019t make a difference to your understanding \u2013 but if you do it will give you an extra thrill.\u201d Chris Womersley takes us on a tour of Fitzroy, where he grew up and continues to live. The now gentrified Melbourne suburb inspired Womersley's new novel Cairo, which takes its name from a block of apartments that housed artists, writers and musicians. In a different take on place in Australian literature, we publish a short story by Tony Birch, a reflection on the role of fairy and folk tales in Australia. The Ghost River tells the story of two teenage boys enthralled by a group of men who live by the river, and the strange tales they tell about the water and its powers of destruction and salvation. And following the release of his novel Solo, William Boyd joins the Guardian Books Podcast this week to reflect on the pleasures and perils of taking on the 007 franchise, and the troubled soul of Ian Fleming's original James Bond. This week's reviews Australian titles include Tom Keneally\u2019s Shame and the Captives, Clare Wright\u2019s The Forgotten Rebels of Eureka, and Tim Winton\u2019s new work, Eyrie. \u201cThroughout Winton's oeuvre he's told stories of lost souls and lost faith\u2026Eyrie is the latest iteration of this story, and it's a cracker,\u201d writes Michael Williams. Among our international reviews, you\u2019ll find the new novella by Zadie Smith, The Embassy of Cambodia, a slim hardback volume which manages to conjure a world in just 69 pages. It is not, however, a short story. \u201cIt's a novel in miniature, divided into 21 tiny \u2018chapters\u2019, each of which is a brief scene that encapsulates what many writers would take several thousand words to say,\u201d says Louise Doughty. In non-fiction, Jacqueline Rose reviews On Resistance: A Philosophy of Defiance by Howard Caygill, a volume that could not, she says, be more timely \u201cwhen resistance across the world \u2013 the Arab uprisings, the Greek revolt against austerity \u2013 seem to be succumbing to the brutality of the army and the law.\u201d Caygill\u2019s work is \u201can act of philosophy and of defiance. It will be indispensable for anyone thinking about resistance in our times\u201d Both Lynne Segal and Penelope Lively tackle ageing in their new books, Out of Time and Ammonites &amp; Leaping Fish \u2013 Segal now in her late 60s, Lively 80 at the time of writing. In a reflective, fascinating review of the two books Tessa Hadley sees two responses to growing old: \"one resigned and even interested and the other wildly anguished. Most of us probably alternate between these comic and tragic responses, the balance struck differently at different times.\" You can read all these reviews and many more here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
