Medics at King\u2019s College hospital NHS foundation trust, in London, raised the alarm after they treated a patient with hyponatremia \u2013 abnormally low sodium \u2013 from drinking too much water to help with a recurring urinary tract infection. In the case highlighted, a 59-year-old woman consumed several litres of water based on medical advice she recalled from previous similar episodes to \u201cflush out her system\u201d. She became progressively shaky, muddled, vomited several times and had significant speech difficulties. Dr Maryann Noronha, the co-author of the study published in BMJ Case Reports on Thursday, said: \u201cWhen people are ill they don\u2019t tend to drink very much water because it\u2019s the last thing they want to do and you can become dehydrated very quickly. \u201cTo counteract that risk, doctors have said \u2018Make sure you drink lots of water.\u2019 That has perpetrated the myth that you must drink gallons of water. Most people don\u2019t do that but in this case they did it to the letter.\u201d Tests revealed her high intake of water had resulted in dangerously low sodium levels \u2013 123 mmol/L \u2013 classifying it as a medical emergency. A mortality rate of almost 30% has been reported for patients with sodium levels of less than 125 mmol/L. Doctors restricted her fluid intake to 1 litre over the next 24 hours. By the following morning her blood tests were normal and she was discharged later that day. In a previous case a woman with gastroenteritis developed hyponatremia and died from drinking excessive amounts of water. Fatal water intoxication has also been reported in people engaged in endurance exercise and using the drug MDMA (ecstasy), when they have sweated heavily and overcompensated with fluids. The authors stress that it is rare to develop water intoxication with normal renal function but warn that some illnesses drive up levels of antidiuretic hormones, which reduce normal excretion of water. \u201cDoctors should try to be more specific in their advice,\u201d said Noronha. \u201cI say to people, while they are ill they should at least consume their normal fluid intake and up to half again [ie, up to 150%]. If you drink three litres, you shouldn\u2019t drink six litres when you are ill.\u201d Public Health England recommends people should drink six to eight glasses of fluid a day, including water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea and coffee. Noronha said the amount needed by different people varies, but the main message is not to change your consumption too greatly when you are ill. \u201cIf you are someone who doesn\u2019t drink much water and then suddenly fill your body with masses that\u2019s going to have a very big effect,\u201d she said. She hopes the paper might prompt research in the area so that objective guidance can be drawn up. Dr Imran Rafi, the chair of clinical innovation and research at the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cDrinking enough water is important in keeping healthy, both physically and mentally, and patients should keep their fluids up when unwell, particularly in conditions that can cause dehydration. \u201cThere is no steadfast recommendation as to how much water people should drink in order to stay healthy, but the key thing is to keep hydrated \u2013 and passing clear urine is a good indication of this. \u201cThis case report highlights that excessive water intake can have important consequences for patients, and this is something that healthcare professionals, and patients, should be mindful of.\u201d What is the advice? Public Health England recommends drinking six to eight glasses of fluid a day, including but not limited to water. There is no official guidance as to how much to drink when ill, but Noronha advises no more than 1.5 times the amount you would usually drink. Noronha says water is generally fine but recommends a rehydrations sachet if suffering from gastroenteritis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
