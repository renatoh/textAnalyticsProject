Inevitable changes of personnel notwithstanding, the group has maintained its high standing in the chamber music world. This disc spans MacMillan's career to date, with two early works, the urgent, energetic Etwas zur\u00fcckhaltend (the name relates to Wagner), and Visions of a November Spring, an important work of stylistic transition, its title reflecting an opening to new modes of expression, its mood at once lyrical and aggressive. The poignant miniature, For Sonny (2011), and the String Quartet No 3 (2007), at once lyrical, ecstatic and ethereal, complete this wide-ranging, vividly played recording."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
