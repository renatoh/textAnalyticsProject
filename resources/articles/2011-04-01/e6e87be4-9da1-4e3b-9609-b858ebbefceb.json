Austrian glaciers have some fresh snow. The Swiss winter season finishes this weekend, but Italian glacier resorts will continue into next week. Snowbird (Utah, US) still has a 500cm base after record-breaking snowfalls. Canadian Banff (175-212cm), Jasper (135cm) and Whistler (343cm) still have great conditions for the time of year. Austrian Neustift (0-200cm) had 10cm of new snow on Wednesday with S\u00f6lden receiving 6cm, keeping conditions fresh for the weekend. In France, Val d'Is\u00e8re (0-85cm), Tignes and Val Thorens (40-95cm, 2cm of new snow) will remain open after the weekend; all other resorts will close for the season. Forecasted new snow in Switzerland should make for a good weekend. Saas Fee (0-245cm) had 7cm of new snow this week, with the best skiing on the glacier. Zermatt will close this weekend but with 67cm new snow expected the summer skiing looks promising. Despite the proximity of May, substantial new Alpine snowfall is forecast today, over the weekend, and into next week above a freezing level of 2,500m. Switzerland will receive the most \u2013 up to 70cm of new snow \u2013 closely followed by Austria (60cm) and Italy, with perhaps 40cm of new snow in France. There will be light snow above 1,800m in Canadian Whistler, which will remain open till 30 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
