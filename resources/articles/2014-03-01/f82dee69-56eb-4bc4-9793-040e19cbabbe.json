She'Koyokh are a multi-lingual eight-piece British band whose members include a classically trained violinist and clarinettist, a Serbian accordionist, an American mandolin player, a Greek percussionist and a remarkable young singer who is a Turkish Kurd. They started out busking in London's Columbia Road flower market, and have developed into impressive exponents of klezmer and traditional styles from Russia, Ukraine, Greece, Turkey and the Balkans. Their jaunty and slinky instrumental pieces include a Russian jazz favourite from the 30s and a Turkish folk tune inspired by the mating habits of goats. They also include an exquisite Bosnian love song, featuring the brooding and stately singing of \u00c7i\u011fdem Aslan. Her solo debut last year saw her hailed as one of the discoveries of last year, so it's strange that she only makes one appearance here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
