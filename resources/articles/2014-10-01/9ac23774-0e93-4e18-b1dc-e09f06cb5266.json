When she walks into the building site that will become her new gallery space just off Golden Square, in London\u2019s Soho, she is dwarfed by scaffolding. She is tiny \u2013 barely 5ft tall \u2013 dressed all in black, and when she speaks, her voice is so soft that the architects in hard hats have to crane down to hear what she is saying. But Goodman, aged 86, has been operating at the pinnacle of the art industry for over half a century. As a gallerist, she was one of the first to introduce key European artists such as Gerhard Richter, Joseph Beuys and Marcel Broodthaers to American audiences and has represented some of the biggest names in the business, including Anselm Kiefer, the sculptor Richard Deacon and the video artist and Oscar-winning film director Steve McQueen. This is the New Yorker\u2019s first foray into the London art scene and it has been greeted with a frisson of anticipation. The Marian Goodman Gallery opens this week with an exhibition of Richter works. \u201cThe whole thing is surreal,\u201d Goodman says in an almost whisper, her words lost in the hammering and drilling. She shakes her head and smiles. The general impression is that of a kindly grandmother, watching on proudly as her cake rises in the oven. But it would be wrong to underestimate her. This is the woman who as an up-and-coming New York gallerist in the early 1980s came across Richter\u2019s work, decided she simply had to represent him and wrote to him insisting they must meet. \u201cHe was a bit drowned out by all these loud, expressionist voices,\u201d Goodman recalls. \u201cSo I wrote him a letter just telling him how much I loved the work and maybe I could make a difference. Then I went to meet him in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1984 and everything started from there.\u201d Richter\u2019s work is now the world\u2019s most expensive for a living artist \u2013 he set a record with the sale of a $34.2m (\u00a321.3m) painting in 2012, only to smash it again at auction last year for a 1968 work that fetched $37m (\u00a324m). Is she surprised by the prices his work commands? \u201cYes,\u201d she says calmly. \u201cI\u2019m surprised and so is he.\u201d Goodman\u2019s eye for art was inherited from her father, Maurice, a first-generation Hungarian-American accountant who collected art in his spare time. Maurice would mount impromptu exhibitions for his two children in the family\u2019s apartment near Central Park, covering the walls with posters and reproductions cut from books and magazines. He had a particular taste for Milton Avery, who became a friend, and for the folk artist Grandma Moses. \u201cI thought he was mad,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cThe Grandma Moses paintings looked to me as if they\u2019d been done by a 10-year-old.\u201d Living in the same apartment block was the art dealer Sidney Janis. One of Goodman\u2019s earliest memories is of playing with Janis\u2019s children in front of a big jungle canvas painted by Henri Rousseau, entitled The Dream (it is now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York). \u201cI remember we played this game in front of the canvas where we pretended we were going to enter the jungle,\u201d says Goodman, chuckling. \u201cI just got to fall in love with art.\u201d She married at 21 to a civil engineer and the couple had two children (her son, Michael, is a photographer; her daughter, Amy, a herbalist). The relationship didn\u2019t last and, as a newly divorced single mother, she turned to art to make a living, enrolling for an art history PhD at Columbia University and, later, setting up a small publishing initiative specialising in artists\u2019 prints, funded by $5,000 from the sale of a Milton Avery her father had given her. It was the 1960s in New York. The art world was buzzing. She rubbed shoulders with Andy Warhol, whom she remembers being \u201cso quiet and hyper-shy\u201d. In 1968, she went to Documenta, an international art show in Germany, and was bowled over by the freshness and originality of the work on display by a new generation of artists seeking to come to terms with their nation\u2019s past. \u201cIt changed everything for me,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cI saw Joseph Beuys\u2019s work for the first time... I tried to get one of the curators at Moma to be interested in it and I had such a rejection! As I got to know the work better, I felt I should represent it in New York.\u201d And, just like that, she set up a gallery on West 57th Street that would become one of the most influential in the world. Talking about it now, Goodman makes it sound easy, but the art industry was a male-dominated environment. She won\u2019t dwell on this, other than to call it \u201csexist\u201d and to recount an unpleasant incident when she first opened her doors and a male gallerist paid her a visit and said: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to bury you.\u201d That must have been scary, I say. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not nice to know you have an enemy you didn\u2019t do anything to deserve,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn some ways, though, I think it may be easier for a woman. It\u2019s a mixed bag but I think women are maybe more attuned to the qualities that a gallerist needs in a relationship with her client.\u201d In fact, Goodman is famed for her nurturing approach. She compares representing artists to \u201ctending a garden\u201d and spends three or four hours on the phone every day talking to them. One of her artists, the photographer Jeff Wall, describes being represented by Marian Goodman as like being in a marriage. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got about 20 other marriages too!\u201d she insists. She chooses an artist on the basis of \u201coriginality and talent\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the nature of each artist\u2019s work\u2026 I think it has to show an involvement with life, the focus of which is bigger than one\u2019s navel.\u201d She is particularly good at spotting new talent and, once she has done so, she commits to working with an artist for 15-20 years. She discovered the German artist Lothar Baumgarten when she hired him to hang the gallery\u2019s display at a D\u00fcsseldorf art fair. \u201cHe told me, very modestly, he was an artist and he had a show on of his work at the time. So I went to see it and I thought the work was fantastic.\u201d She is as astonished as anyone that she has an eye for great art. It\u2019s an instinct, Goodman says, and not one she can properly put into words. But she has an abiding horror of the mob mentality \u2013 a legacy, perhaps, of her progressive education at New York\u2019s the Little Red School House (one of the first ethnically diverse schools in the city), and her Jewish, immigrant heritage. When, in the 1980s, all the major New York galleries moved en masse to Soho, Goodman stayed put. She represented cerebral Europeans at a time when everyone else in New York was showing big American names. These days, in an era when uber-gallerists have become celebrities in their own right, Goodman stays determinedly out of the spotlight. She gives few interviews and hates being the centre of attention. Why? \u201cWell, I think the credit belongs to the artist,\u201d she says, as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. mariangoodman.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
