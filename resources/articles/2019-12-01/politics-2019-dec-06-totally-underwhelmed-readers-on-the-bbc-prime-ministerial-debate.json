Far better performance. I don\u2019t think Johnson\u2019s tactic of trying to focus every answer onto Brexit worked. comrade1 \u2018Totally underwhelmed by both of them\u2019 Watching the debate. Totally underwhelmed by both of them. Wishing there was A Monster Raving Loony party candidate in the debate as it could only improve its quality. hybridartifacts \u2018The cameras seem more sympathetic to Johnson\u2019 Corbyn has the moral high ground and facts on most issues, but Johnson\u2019s voice is more shrill and seems louder, he always gets the last word in and uses his metronomic sound bites more successfully. The cameras and Nick Robinson seem more sympathetic to Johnson. andrewjonesfoto \u2018I wish Corbyn won with all my heart, but I think Boris did tonight\u2019 Just finished watching it. My strong sense was Corbyn was honest, spoke with an intimate sense of the issues, a lot of empathy for the average person \u2013 but was also a bit too complex/academic for many (sadly). He also sometimes focused on his comfort zone (homelessness etc.) but the fact is most people are not without a home, going to food banks etc. So my worry is, people will think nice guy, but he\u2019s not what I need. He also sounded contrived on Brexit. Boris just recited lots of simple but effective lies, but was a more assertive speaker, his voice literally sounds stronger than Corbyn\u2019s. I\u2019m afraid that, although I am probably more socialist radical than JC and wish he won with all my heart, I think Boris won tonight and will win at this rate. I don\u2019t think Nick Robinson was that bad. Ordinarily \u2018Head-to-head with Johnson, Corbyn looks statesman like\u2019 Corbyn has said some dumb shit over the years but head-to-head with Johnson he looks, dare I say it? Statesman like. If I had to choose between them I\u2019d pick the beardy one over the sweaty chancer. John Munro \u2018Johnsons is so poor at debating\u2019 Johnson is so poor at debating. His benefits of Brexit sounded absolutely pants, quite apart from the fact that none of it was true! bobthebuilder234 \u2018I don\u2019t think Corbyn did enough to change minds\u2019 Well Corbyn did not do anything bad, but he really should have pushed back more when Johnson was making blatant lies about Labour polices, and he should have just called Johnson a liar. So IMO I don\u2019t think he did enough to change minds, so I pray there are enough people already going to vote for Labour to beat the Tories! partizanman \u2018A baked potato is oven ready; the future of our country is not a baked potato\u2019 A baked potato is oven ready. The future of our country is not a baked potato, it\u2019s millions of lives, businesses, friendships, relationships, jobs, security, environment. David Kirk \u2018Absolutely no shame at all from Johnson\u2019 Just did a genuine LOL at the 50k nurses from Johnson. Absolutely no shame at all. Graeme Quinnell \u2018Johnson has no manners whatsoever\u2019 Johnson should be expelled from the debate. He interrupted Corbyn in mid-flow. He has no manners whatsoever and is simply disrupting proceedings and showing contempt for the public. redfalcon \u2018How did UK politics sink so low?\u2019 The absolute state of these two. How did UK politics sink so low? GatehouseAmi \u2018Corbyn is walking this\u2019 Holy smokes, Corbyn is walking this. He sounds calm and measured and on top of his agenda. (I\u2019m listening on the radio). Boris is desperate, blustering, and scattergun. I didn\u2019t think Corbyn had it in him. bsam \u2018Johnson sounds like a waffling idiot\u2019 Johnson is losing this one. Corbyn\u2019s answers are reasoned and concise. Johnson sounds like a waffling idiot. trojunhorse99 \u2018The best we can hope for is a hung parliament\u2019 In a normal country this would be the end of the matter. Next week Corbyn would be in government with a 150 MPs majority. Here the best we can hope for is a hung parliament.
