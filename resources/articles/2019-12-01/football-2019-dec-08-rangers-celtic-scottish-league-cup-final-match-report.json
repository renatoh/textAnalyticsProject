The Australian midfielder Tom Rogic sealed the fabled Invincibles campaign in Brendan Rodgers\u2019s first season at the club with a last-gasp winner against Aberdeen in the 2017 Scottish Cup final but that particular goal came after a second-half bombardment of the Pittodrie side. Not that Neil Lennon will care too much. The Celtic manager became the second man in Scottish football to win all three domestic honours with one club as player and manager. Since taking over from Rodgers in February he has led Celtic to three successive trophies. Hampden seemed like a tables-turned affair from the mid-90s as Celtic absorbed wave after wave of Rangers attacks before nicking a winner. That television pictures suggested three Celtic players were offside as Christopher Jullien turned Ryan Christie\u2019s free-kick into the net on the hour mark only served to rub salt into Ibrox wounds. And what of Alfredo Morelos? The Colombian striker has won plaudits and credit this season for a run of games when he has shown composure and elegance in front of goal, as his haul of 25 would testify. But his achilles heel comes against Celtic with his profligacy here perhaps the most wounding of all for his side. His temperament, too, showed a flash of the old Morelos in one incident when he seemed to rake his studs down the back of Scott Brown\u2019s leg. Skipping past Kristoffer Ajer, who had slid in on Morelos without winning the ball midway through the opening period, the stage was set for the striker to score his first goal against Celtic as he bore down on Forster. But the goalkeeper, who had warmed up for his heroic afternoon with an excellent left-hand save from a rasping Ryan Jack 25-yard effort, stuck out a leg to thwart Morelos. It was the first of many. Scott Arfield\u2019s deft pass into the feet of Morelos put the striker in behind the defence only for Forster to spread his body and make the block. But the most damning miss came in the immediate aftermath of Celtic\u2019s goal. The 18-year-old Jeremie Frimpong showed his inexperience as he barged into the back of Morelos. The striker went down, the referee, Willie Collum, pointed to the spot and Frimpong\u2019s afternoon was ended prematurely with a flash of the red card. James Tavernier, Rangers\u2019 usual penalty taker but who has missed three this season, later suggested the plan all along was for Morelos to take any spot kicks. Given the manner in which his afternoon had gone and with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been wise to hand the ball to a willing alternative. Forster dived to his right to save the penalty, at once lifting Celtic and puncturing Rangers\u2019 spirit. Celtic could and should have guaranteed a more comfortable passage towards the finish line. Odsonne \u00c9douard was not fit enough to start the game but came off the bench just before Jullien scored and was almost the architect of what would have been a definitive second goal. An intelligent, perfectly weighted pass played in Mikey Johnston, who had replaced the ineffective Mohamed Elyounoussi at the break, but as the youngster headed through one-on-one with the Rangers keeper, Allan McGregor, he slipped and pushed his effort wide of the target. It made for a frantic finale to the game as the 10 men of Celtic hung on. There were jubilant scenes from them when the whistle went while Rangers were crushed after having given so much to be left with so little. Rangers\u2019 performance offers evidence to suggest the gap between the sides is as tight as it has been since the club went into administration in 2011. There was guile and spirit about their display, which has not always been the case in these affairs. It would have felt like scant consolation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
