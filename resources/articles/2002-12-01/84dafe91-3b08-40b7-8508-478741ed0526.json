The kick-off was put back 80 minutes after Aston Villa and Liverpool supporters had to collect more than 4,000 pre-paid tickets shortly before the scheduled 7.45pm start. Normally Villa set a maximum of 1,200 such tickets bought via Ticketmaster but the number was quadrupled on Wednesday because of worries over possible delays caused by the Christmas post. \"We sold 5,000 tickets for the match in seven days,\" said Peter Jackson, Ticketmaster's managing director. \"Due to the Christmas posting times, 4,000 tickets were for collection on the night. Supporters were asked to arrive as early as possible but, with the rush-hour traffic and road works, they did not arrive until 7.30pm through no fault of their own. \"Ticketmaster and Aston Villa put on extra staff to handle the collections but the massive queues meant the match was quite rightly delayed for safety reasons. We apologise to the club and the supporters for the delays that occurred.\" Villa conducted their own investigation and concluded that three factors, including the decision not to commit 4,000 tickets to the vagaries of the post, had been responsible. That decision, however, was justified by 750 Liverpool supporters not receiving tickets posted on Monday. \"We had to issue duplicates for all those as well,\" said Mark Ansell, Villa's deputy chief executive. \"But the fact that that situation was caused by postal delays suggests Ticketmaster got it right.\" Ansell also cited the publication of a later kick-off time by some sections of the media as a contributory cause, but Villa fans were in unforgiving mood, particularly after their side lost 4-3 to an injury-time goal. \"It's all well and good Ticketmaster accepting the blame but they are employed by Villa and the buck should stop with them,\" said Richard Guy, a London-based Villa fan. \"I had to queue for an hour and 10 minutes for my tickets and for the first 45 minutes it was fairly good-humoured. Then it sounded as though the game had started and the mood changed. People started pushing and shoving but fortunately - and more by luck than judgment because there were not many safety barriers - no one was hurt.\" Guy, who travelled to the match by car, saw the whole game but some Liverpool fans were not so fortunate: with the last train to Lime Street leaving Birmingham at 22.15pm many left before half-time. Buck Chinn, the chairman of the Aston Villa Shareholders Association, said the fiasco had done little for the club's image. \"It's shown the club up to be completely incompetent and out-of-date,\" he said. \"This was the way football used to be in the 40s; I half expected Laurel and Hardy to be providing the half-time entertainment.\" This fine mess also meant fans in remote areas of the country were unable to read about the match in the morn ing papers because the game started too late for reports to be included in first editions. The ill-wind, however, blew Sky TV plenty of good: rather than viewers switching off, the delay created extra interest. \"The delayed kick-off meant we had to move a couple of programmes but that was not a problem because we've five sports channels,\" said a spokesman. \"We won't be able to establish the exact viewing figures for a week or so but we found our audience increasing as the situation unfolded. I think people enjoyed our pre-match coverage plus there was also the curiousity factor. Then, when the game finally got under away, it provided cracking entertainment.\" Sky do not anticipate complaints from advertisers feeling they were short-changed by the rescheduled kick-off time and Villa are unlikely to incur any financial penalties because of the problems. \"We will be asking for a report into why it was delayed but there is unlikely to be a formal investigation,\" said a spokesman for the Football League, the competition's organisers. \"Our concern would have been far greater if the match had been called off. The reasons for the delay are pretty clear and certainly all clubs should learn from what went wrong and act accordingly to make sure a similar incident does not happen again.\" That will be foremost in Villa's minds, after doubts about the club's ability to stage major cup fixtures were raised for the second time in less than 12 months. Wednesday's events followed Villa's FA Cup tie against Manchester United in January, which was marred by pitch invasions. And, as a regular venue for FA Cup semi-finals and a host for an England international following Wembley's closure, the club can ill-afford such incidents. \"It was very embarrassing,\" admitted the Villa chairman, Doug Ellis, \"but the buck stops with me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
