No wonder the two fine tries he scored for Leicester at the weekend felt so good and have encouraged him to believe that other dreams, including a full cap for England, may yet come true. Benjamin has played barely a handful of games since moving to Leicester from Worcester 18 months ago, his progress interrupted by a toe injury and the worrying neck injury he sustained in an A league game last year. His comeback against Ulster in Belfast in October did not go splendidly and only now is he starting to resemble the lethal finisher of old. England are increasingly short of fit left-wings but the Solihull-born player knows better than to get carried away, having spent 13 months on the sidelines, five of them in a neck brace. \"There were times when I did think quite seriously I wouldn't be able to get back. \"People can tell you all the right things and you can do all the rehab but when you have a setback with your neck \u2013 and I had a couple \u2013 you do start to think: 'Is it worth it?' \"It is the area of your body you don't want to be getting injured. I had a broken vertebra and it also came out of alignment a little bit. I had two and a half months in the neck brace initially and then it turned out I needed an operation, so I had another two and a half months afterwards. There were times when I did question coming back but I've had great support from my family, friends and girlfriend and from the club. I am fortunate to be back out there.\" Benjamin's first try against Montpellier, which took him past four helpless defenders, suggested he is now well and truly healed, courtesy of the same surgeon, Peter Hamlyn, who ensured Tom Croft returned from a similar injury. It will do much for Benjamin's confidence, not to mention his family's. \"I know they were all very worried but they did a good job of hiding it. They knew how much I liked the game and I knew as soon as I got the all clear from the surgeon I wouldn't have any fears about coming back. I feel a lot happier with my game now than as recently as six weeks ago.\" With a couple of other Leicester players \u2013 Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling \u2013 having also benefited from Hamlyn's expertise, both club and country have every reason to be grateful. Benjamin, 25, has scored six tries in four games for England Saxons but still harbours ambitions to take the next step. \"I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it at all. Every player thinks about it and I am definitely no different. I've had some experience of the Saxons in the past and I would like the chance to play for the full side at some point.\" Might his past involvement under Lancaster be a help? \"I do know Stuart Lancaster \u2013 I have played under him a few times for the Saxons \u2013 but so do a lot of other players. I'd like to think I would be in the mix but it is mainly one person's opinion and you never know what that is until they announce the squad.\" A return to the Saxons squad due to be named next month is a possible first step if Benjamin keeps healthy and continues to make up for lost time at Leicester, commencing with the return leg in Montpellier this Sunday. \"I had five really good years at Worcester and I enjoyed them but playing in these pressure games in the Heineken Cup is a different stage. I am glad to be involved.\" If anyone deserves a lucky break in 2014, it is Benjamin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
