Referee: G Veissiere (France) 1 United get things underway in the latest round of this north European derby that just happens to involve teams from England and Germany. As if that means diddly anyway. 5 Gary Neville gives away a free-kick near United's right corner flag, but redeems himself when he makes the clearance - sets up a break for Ryan Giggs down the left but Owen Hargreaves left Giggs standing in the chase. 7 United free-kick 30 yards out, played short, comes to nothing. What to say about the opening seven minutes? United up for it with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer up front a sign of their intent. Bayern for their part do not like they will just sit back and take it. Should be lively. 10 Bayern corner after Roque Santa Cruz almost got in behind Ronnie Johnsen; comes to nothing. 14 Bayern up the ante and the pressure with Bixente Lizarazu just failing to find Paulo Sergio 10 yards out. 15 Hargreaves steam off down the right and Mikael Silvestre is forced to muscle him out just as he gets level with the area. 17 Just over one third of the half gone and Bayern are doing fair old job of keeping United under control. 24 Giggs looking one of the livliest for United; cuts in from the left after good work by van Nistelrooy in the Bayern area to curl a shot wide of the far post - not so close but United's best chance so far. 28 Sergio with a snap volley at the far from a Hargreaves cross - saved, and the whistle had gone anyway. 29 Free-kick to Bayern to the right of United's area after Sammy Kuffour forces Silvestre into a rash challenge with some fine skill; Effenberg takes but United get it together enough to clear. 31 van Nistelrooy breaks into 18-yard box... offside. 33 United corner; Beckham takes towards Giggs beyond the far post but Kuffour does enough to distract him from connecting for a volley. 37 Giggs breaks through the middle, finds Solskjaer out on the right and signals for the return. He gets it but it is too far ahead of him and easy for Oliver Kahn. Solskjaer may have done better taking on the last man himself. 37 Booking Laurent Blanc for a challenge on Sergio. 40 United work the ball around the Bayern area via Veron on the right, Beckham in the middle and Keane on the left. Keane's cross rebounds back out and he goes in late on Effenberg to try and reclaim. Ref plays the advantage and then Solskjaer does his bit and also takes out Effenberg for good measure. Keane gets away with a warning. Half-time. Good news for Bayern; not so good news for Alex Ferguson. 46 Bayern get the second 45 underway and provide the first action when Pizarro wastes a chance in the United area. 48 Giggs with a great run at Kuffour, beats him and shoots to force Kahn to save beyond the far post for a corner; Beckham takes, comes to nothing but United keep up the pressure. 51 Non-stop so far this half; Neville with a long throw into the Bayern area; Keane flicks on but Bayern clear. 52 Another corner to United, taken quickly, Solskjaer just failing to get in at the far post. 54 Giggs forces a corner off Hargreaves; Beckham takes and Silvestre heads back just beyond the upright angle. 58 Silvestre with a half-chance after some good build up work, but Kahn beats him to Beckham's cross into the six-yard box. 61 All United pressure so far this half; first chance for van Nistelrooy after Giggs comes in from the left and crosses for the Dutchman to head over from 10 yards. 62 And then Bayern come back... free-kick to the Germans wide of the United area on the right; in by Effenberg for Sergio to head at Barthez and force a fine low save from the Frenchman. 64 Wafter from Beckham sets up a van Nistelrooy shot from 10 yards; Kahn parries back to him but van Nistelrooy can do no more than attempt a kind of half-baksheel in reply. 66 Beckham corner; cleared by Santa Cruz, kept in by Beckham and crossed back in; comes to nothing. 67 Effenberg gives away a free-kick on the United left 35 yards out. Beckham takes for Neville, luring just outside the area, to mis-kick disastrously. 70 Corner after the ball falls luckily for van the man in Bayern's area; comes to nothing. 73 Substitution Torsten Fink on for Jens Jeremies. 74 Effenberg with a 25-yard daisy-cutter-cum-worm-beheader that Barthez covers competently. 76 Bayern have weathered the storm and are asserting themselves on the game again. 77 Substitution Zickler on for Santa Cruz. 78 Substitution Diego Forlan on for Solskjaer. 86 The ghost of late goals past begins to haunt this match as Bayern win a corner; United clear and break with Giggs but it comes to nothing. 88 Beckham free-kick to Giggs on the far side of the area; Giggs knocks it back for van Nistelrooy but Thomas Linke does enough to block the threat. 90 Full-time. A draw for Boavista in Nantes means that both Bayern and United are through to the last eight - it just remains to be seen who will finish top."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
