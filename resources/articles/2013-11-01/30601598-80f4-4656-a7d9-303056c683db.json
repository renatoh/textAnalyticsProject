This brings to an end the main part of our live blog for today, but we will continue to post the final scores from the late games, and you can continue to discuss all the action in the comments section below. Before I go, here are the latest scores from the games currently in progress: Colts 3-21 Cardinals Titans 6-6 Raiders Cowboys 14-3 Giants A few immediate thoughts on today\u2019s early games: - Does anybody actually want to win the NFC North? The Lions looked like clear favourites a fortnight ago, but have lost in consecutive weeks to teams who had won just two games between them through the first nine weeks of the season. The Bears got blown out in St Louis today, and Green Bay could only tie at home to Minnesota. But if everyone else carries on like this, you would have to fancy the Packers\u2019 chances of saving their season once Aaron Rodgers returns in a week or two. - Before this season began, the Texans and Falcons were both billed as Super Bowl contenders. Now they are vying for the first overall pick in the 2014 draft. As bad as the Texans have been, did anyone really believe they could lose at home to the Jags? But credit to Jacksonville, they have played a lot better these last few weeks. - After winning their first nine games of the season, the Chiefs have lost two in a row. With the Broncos coming to town next, it could easily soon become three. How worried should they be? That question is hard to answer without knowing the long-term prognosis for top pass rushers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. The Chiefs\u2019 sack numbers had already taken a hit lately, but without those two on the field, the defense looked a lot less intimidating. Who were today\u2019s big individual stars? Here are a few of the stand-outs: - Josh Gordon: 14 receptions for 237 yards, 1 TD - Jamaal Charles: 14 carries for 115 yards, 2 TDs; 4 receptions for 42 yards - Philip Rivers: 27 of 39 passes completed for 392 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INT OK, the 1pm ET kickoff games are finally all done. Here is how they all finished: Saints 17-13 Falcons Steelers 27-11 Browns Buccaneers 24-21 Lions Chargers 41-38 Chiefs Bears 21-42 Rams Panthers 20-16 Dolphins Jets 3-19 Ravens Jaguars 13-6 Texans Vikings 26-26 Packers (after OT) And here is how things stand in the 4.05pm and 4.25pm ET games, of which there are three: Titans 6-3 Raiders Colts 3-14 Cardinals Cowboys 7-0 Giants Minnesota opt against the kick, Christian Ponder instead throwing the ball to Cordarelle Patterson, who briefly looks as though he might have found a seam, but then is swarmed by defenders. The game ends in a tie, which could make for some interesting playoff permutations going forward. The Vikings will get the ball back one last time with one second left. After the fair catch, they do have the option of attempting a free-kick to win the game. But it would be an 86-yarder. After trading field goals, Green Bay and Minnesota have now exchanged punts in overtime. The Packers have the ball back with less than two minutes remaining. Arizona are off to a fast start in their game against Indianapolis, Carson Palmer finding Larry Fitzgerald in the end zone for the second time already today. And Minnesota do tie things up in overtime, Blair Walsh with the successful conversion at the end of a 12 play, 63-yard drive. So now we are into next-score-wins territory, but there is only 3:49 remaining now in overtime. The Long brothers share a quick embrace on the field at the end of another great game at the Edward Jones Dome. One of them leaves a lot happier than the other. And there you have it. Twenty-four seconds simply were not enough for the Chiefs to pull off an improbable comeback, and that means that San Diego are our winners in a brilliant game at Arrowhead. The first score in overtime goes to Green Bay, Mason Crosby converting from 20 yards, but under the (no longer all that) new overtime rules, Minnesota will get one chance to respond. Unbelievable scenes in Kansas City, where Philip Rivers sjust picked out Seyi Ajirotutu in the end zone for a 26-yard scoring pass. Just 24 seconds remain for the Chiefs to respond. Robert Quinn seals victory for St Louis, sacking Josh McCown and forcing a fumble as he does so, before scooping up the loose ball himself and taking it back eight yards to the end zone. Still two minutes left, but this one is done. Meanwhile, in our late games, Carson Palmer\u2019s four-yard pass to Larry Fitzgerald has given Arizona an early lead over Indianapolis. Colts 0-7 Cardinals. Carolina close out the victory in Miami! They have now won seven straight \u2013 the longest active streak in the NFL. Two huge, huge scores here. First Alex Smith finds Dwayne Bowe in the end zone on a five-yard pass that restores the Kasnas City\u2019s lead in what has been a brilliant AFC West clash with San Diego. The Chiefs now lead 38-34 with 1:22 remaining. They could yet lose, but surely this is proof that this team can, indeed, hold its own in a shoot-out? And then Cam Newton hooks up with tight end Greg Olsen for a one-yard score that makes it Panthers 20-16 Dolphins. This has been a huge comeback from Carolina, who were down 16-3 just before half-time. Less than a minute left in that one. The Rams\u2019 starting running back Zac Stacy left this game some time ago with a head injury, but his back-up Benny Cunningham is doing just fine, and just restored St Louis\u2019s two-score advantage on a nine-yard run around right tackle. He has 109 yards on 13 carries. Pittsburgh become the first AFC North team to win on the road in Cleveland this season, as their own improbable recovery from a disastrous start to the season continues. At 5-6, they remain in playoff contention. Green Bay make it 17 unanswered points at home to Minnesota. With less than a minute left, this one is almost certainly going to overtime. And they have done it! After losing their first eight games of the season, the Buccaneers have now won three straight. The Lions, who appeared well placed to take control of the NFC North following injuries to Jay Cutler and Aaron Rodgers, have dropped a second close game in as many weeks. Oh my. Despite all their missed field goals, it appears that the Buccaneers are indeed about to beat the Lions in Detroit. Matthew Stafford is picked for for the fourth time today \u2013 this time by Johnathan Banks, and Tampa Bay have the ball back with less than a minute left. They lead 24-21. After an endless back-and-forth on the St Louis goal-line, in which the Rams seemed to deny the Bears about nine or 10 times, before having their efforts chalked off by penalties on each occasion, Chicago finally punch the ball in, Michael Bush chugging into the end zone from one yard out. Still more than seven minutes left in this game. San Diego just keep coming in Kansas City, exploiting a Chiefs defense that has lost both of its top two pass rushers \u2013 Tamba Hali and Justin Houston \u2013 to injuries. Philip Rivers hit Lardarius Green deep over the middle, and the receiver ran away from defenders for a 60-yard score. The Jets\u2019 season-long pattern of alternating wins with losses is at an end. Two Geno Smith interceptions contributed to a meek effort in Baltimore. Rian Lindell has missed another short kick for the Buccaneers, who could be nine points ahead now, but instead are down 24-21 in Detroit. Just a consolation score for Cleveland, even though they did tack on the two-point conversion, but Fantasy players might still be excited to hear about the day that Josh Gordon is having for the home team. A one-yard scoring pass from Weeden means that the receiver\u2019s stat line now shows 12 catches for 204 yards and a score. Our first game is already finished, Jacksonville with a surprising win on the road in Houston. The Texans have now lost nine straight, and might just be on course to steal that first-round pick in next year\u2019s draft. Kansas City go 57 yards in six plays, but cannot quite finish their drive, Alex Smith throwing incomplete on third-and-and goal from the seven, obliging Ryan Succop to come on and kick the 25-yard field goal. Oh Brandon Weeden. The Cleveland quarterback had already given up one fumble since entering the game in in relief of the injured Jason Campbell, and now he hammers another nail into his team\u2019s coffin with an interception that William Gay returns 21-yards for the score. It\u2019s all over here. Is the comeback on in Green Bay? Matt Flynn throws his first touchdown pass since returning to the team, connecting with Jarrett Boykin on a six-yard button-hook over the middle. That said, it was the running back Eddie Lacy who put the quarterback in position with a series of bull-like runs, dragging opponents down the field. Devin Hester thought he had equalled Deion Sanders\u2019 record for most return touchdowns in NFL history, taking back Johnny Hekker\u2019s punt 60 yards for a score in St Louis, but the play has been called back for a holding penalty. I do have another field goal to tell you about, though, Nick Novak\u2019s 30-yarder bringing San Diego to within a point of Kansas City. Chargers 27-28 Chiefs. A huge blown opportunity for the Buccaneers, who fail to convert their blocked punt into points, as Rian Lindell misses from 35 yards. It remains Buccaneers 24-21 Lions. And he did it really well, too. On fourth-and-18 from the Cleveland 29, the Steelers eschewed the long field goal attempt (understandable in snowy conditions) and instead kept their offense out on the field. But Big Ben surprised the Cleveland defense by punting himself, a perfect pooch kick that was downed on the one-yard line. For the second straight week, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have recorded a blocked punt, and this one could have huge implications. They will take over now on the Detroit 11-yard line, with a chance to establish a two-score lead. OK, there have been a couple of field goals that I\u2019ve failed to tell you about here so far, but rather than bore you with individual details, how about I just tell you how things stand with a sweep of all the scores around the league? Every game is now into the fourth quarter. Steelers 20-3 Browns Buccaneers 24-21 Lions Vikings 23-13 Packers Chargers 24-28 Chiefs Bears 14-27 Rams Panthers 13-16 Dolphins Jets 3-19 Ravens Jaguars 13-6 Texans Tampa Bay strike back once again in Detroit, Mike Glennon hooking up with Tiquan Underwood on an 85-yard scoring pass which makes it Buccaneers 24-21 Lions. And Kansas City have displayed their own resilience by driving straight down the field to restore their lead over San Diego. A seven-play, 64-yard drive goes a long way towards making up for that Alex Smith interception. Chargers 24-28 Chiefs. Green Bay finally show some signs of life, drawing to within 10 points of Minnesota on a three-yard Eddie Lacy run. Admittedly, it was set up by a pair of huge penalties against the Vikings \u2013 one for pass interference, and another for illegal use of hands to the face by Jared Allen, but in this game, the Packers will take what they can get. Just under 12minutes remain in Lambeau. Green Bay go for two, but Flynn\u2019s pass falls incomplete. Danny Woodhead comes up with his second touchdown of the day, this one \u2013 unusually for this particular running back \u2013 coming on an actual running play. He showed good athleticism to launch himself over the line on the three-yard score, but really this touchdown was all about the events that preceded it. On third-and-10 from his own 12-yard line, Alex Smith threw a bad interception to Marcus Gilchrist \u2013 the one thing you cannot afford to do if your supposed role in an offense is to be an effective game manager. A message from my Guardian colleague Hunter Felt, here: Is this a baseball reference? Because I have to admit, I don\u2019t actually get it. The New York Jets\u2019 win one, lose one streak might just be at an end, unless Geno Smith has been keeping something quite special in reserve. Baltimore have been slowly chipping away at their opponents in this game, but finally blow it open here on a 66-yard scoring pass from Joe Flacco to Jacoby Jones, who simply blew through the Jets\u2019 secondary on a post pattern. Staring at fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line in St Louis, Marc Trestman tells the Chicago offense to stay out on the field and try to punch the ball in. But they cannot do so, linebacker JoLonn Dunbar bursting through to clobber Michael Bush for a four-yard loss \u2013 a play which not only forces a turnover, but also gives the Rams more breathing room on offense than they might have had if the running back had even made it back to the line of scrimmage. Kansas City are back on top against San Diego, and who else would it be but Jamaal Charles, forcing his way in from the one-yard line. The Lions still lead at home to Tampa Bay, but Matthew Stafford just threw his third interception of the day, Keith Tandy getting between the quarterback and Nate Burleson on a pass to the end zone. It remains Buccaneers 17-21 Lions, but the visitors have possession back at their own 17-yard line. Does the comeback start here? Cam Newton has not thrown well today, completing just 13 of 24 passes for 127 yards, no touchdowns and one interception, but he still hasn\u2019t forgotten how to use his legs, and tucks the ball in and takes it across the line himself on a five-yard run to bring his team back into contention. Ben Roethlisberger hooks up with Emmanuel Sanders on a short touchdown pass after Allen returned a Jason Campbell fumble to the four-yard line. The Browns can count themselves highly unfortunate \u2013 it looked very much like the quarterback had been subjected to an illegal hit on the play where he coughed up the ball. I\u2019m still getting a good amount of correspondence regarding Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. Here\u2019s another tweet from Dylan Wilbur: Matt Flynn has taken over at quarterback for Green Bay, replacing the struggling Scott Tolzien, but it is James Starks who did the damage just now on a 34-yard rush that takes the Packers across midfield. And there\u2019s another one. Matthew Stafford puts his team back on top in this back-and-forth battle at Ford Field with an 18-yard pass to Brandon Pettigrew. What was once an imposing 14-3 lead for Kansas City at home, has now been completely wiped out, Ryan Matthews chugging his way into the end zone from a yard out to put the Chargers up 17-14 over the Chiefs. Over in Green Bay, meanwhile, Matt Flynn is warming up as the Packers fall further behind, Christian Ponder hooking up with Rhett Ellison on a 12-yard scoring pass. Vikings 20-7 Packers. The first score of the second half is a 20-yard kick from Randy Bullock, after Case Keenum could not quite find DeAndre Hopkins in the right side of the end zone. The decision to send in the field goal unit on fourth-and-goal was met by boos in Reliant Stadium. Not loud ones, though, as there aren\u2019t a whole load of people there. So, who are today\u2019s Fantasy stand-outs so far? A few atypical names in this group: - Mike Wallace: 2 receptions for 110 yards, 1 TD - Maurice Jones-Drew: 6 carries for 50 yards, 1 TD; 5 receptions for 47 yards - Zac Stacy: 12 carries for 87 yards, 1 TD Every game is now at the half, except the one in St Louis, where there are 25 seconds left in the second quarter. The Panthers responded in Miami with a field goal of their own just before the interval, so here\u2019s how things stand: Steelers 13-3 Browns Buccaneers 17-14 Lions Vikings 13-7 Packers Chargers 10-14 Chiefs Bears 14-24 Rams Panthers 6-16 Dolphins Jets 3-9 Ravens Jaguars 10-3 Texans And now a couple more field goals. Greg Zuerlein extends the Rams\u2019 lead from 29 yards, and Caleb Sturgis does the same for Miami from 23. It\u2019s now Bears 14-24 Rams and Panthers 3-16 Dolphins. Lots of games going into the half now, but San Diego find their way back into this game just before the interval, Philip Rivers picking out Danny Woodhead with a fine pass to the back corner of the end zone. We\u2019ve had a couple of kicks elsewhere, and it\u2019s now Steelers 13-3 Browns and Jets 3-9 Ravens. So it turns out that British tennis player Laura Robson is a Panthers fan? The Panthers might have beaten the 49ers and Patriots in the last two weeks, but they are struggling badly in Miami right now, down 13-3 after a Caleb Sturgis field goal just now, and likely to fall even further behind in the near future, after Cam Newton was intercepted by Nolan Carroll, who returned the ball to the Carolina 24. Matthew Stafford gives up his second interception of the day and this one goes back to the house, Leonard Johnson stepping between the quarterback and his tight end Brandon Pettigrew, before racing back 48 yards in the other direction. Elsewhere, Jamaal Charles\u2019s seven-yard scoring run makes it Chargers 3-14 Chiefs. Two almost simultaneous scores just now, as Josh McCown slings the ball to Brandon Marshall on a quick out route for a three-yard touchdown in St Louis to make it Bears 14-21 Rams, and Adrian Peterson blasts his way into the end zone on a one-yard run that gives the Vikings\u2019 a 13-7 lead in Green Bay. Oh, and if that touchdown wasn\u2019t upsetting enough to Browns fans, I have some even worse news: Brandon Weeden is back in at quarterback for the home team after Jason Campbell left the game hurt. Has any player ever been gifted more opportunities by fate in a single season than Weeden this year? Could Antonio Brown turn out to be Joe Haden\u2019s kryptonite? The Steelers wide receiver already had four receptions in the first two quarters of this game, and his fifth turns out to be a doozy \u2013 41 yards to the end zone down the left sideline. Brown juggled the ball in the end zone, but held on. Haden, who restricted AJ Green to under 10 yards last week, can\u2019t seem to contain him. Jacksonville\u2019s efforts to sabotage their own position in next year\u2019s draft continue apace, as Josh Scobee converts from 30 yards at the end of another strong drive. Maurice Jones-Drew is having a nice day so far, with five carries for 60 yards and a score. And the two Long brothers are right at the heart of it. I\u2019m not sure exactly what started the whole thing, to be honest, but Kyle Long appears to have been involved, and it ended with his brother (and opponent) Chris trying to pull him out of the melee. The Fauria touchdown stands. Meanwhile, Blair Walsh has kicked another field goal in Green Bay. Vikings 6-7 Packers. The Lions thing they have reclaimed the lead at home to Tampa Bay, Matthew Stafford finding Joseph Fauria by the right sideline in the end zone, but they\u2019re going to have to review that to make sure he had control of the ball and both feet down in-bounds. Still, we got treated to another Fauria end zone dance either way, the tight end performing what looked like a mini-segment of the Macarena. This game always seemed likely to be a shoot-out, given the two teams\u2019 flimsy secondaries, and we might just be headed in that direction after Mike Glennon responds to the Lions\u2019 opening touchdown by leading his team on a six-play, 80-yard drive that ends with an 11-yard strike to Tiquan Underwood in the end zone. Bad news here for Chiefs fans, as Tamba Hali has to be helped off the field with an ankle injury. That would be a huge blow to this team going forward if it turned out to be serious. The team have officially declared him as \u2018questionable\u2019 to return, but given that he needed two men to help get him off the field, and subsequently had a cart take him to the locker room, it does not look good. Every game is early into the second quarter, so here\u2019s a sweep of how things stand around the league: Steelers 3-3 Browns Buccaneers 3-7 Lions Vikings 3-7 Packers Chargers 3-7 Chiefs Bears 7-21 Rams Panthers 3-7 Dolphins Jets 3-6 Ravens Jaguars 7-0 Texans Baltimore get their noses in front against the Jets, Justin Tucker converting from 26 yards after a 60-yard reception from Torrey Smith took them into range. Here\u2019s some more Manning v Brady talk: It\u2019s an all-time All-Start team, you can have whoever you want! Nate Burleson celebrates his return from injury with a touchdown for Detroit, and does it in good humour \u2013 miming the act of delivering a pizza. The Lions wide receiver has been out of action since September, after breaking his arm in a car accident which occurred after he got distracted trying to prevent a pizza from sliding off the passenger seat in his car. Quite the game going on in St Louis right now, where every series so far has ended in either a touchdown or turnover. St Louis find their way into the end zone for a third time already, Kellen Clemens hooking up with Jared Cook on a six-yard scoring pass after Zac Stacy had done much of the leg work in getting his team down the field. Still more than a minute left in the first quarter. Tore Asheim would like to redress the balance on the subject of which quarterback he would prefer to hang out with. Agreed \u2013 I\u2019ve always been of the impression that the whole Manning clan has a good sense of humour. Although I suspect Eli is the real joker. That wasn't Smith's only tidy completion on that series, either. Who says Alex Smith can\u2019t throw downfield? Well, lots of people actually, but the Chiefs quarterback looked pretty good on this 32-yard scoring dart to wide receiver Donnie Avery over the middle of the field. Two more of these to tell you about. Rian Lindell delivers the first blow in Detroit, slotting it through from 38 yards to give the Buccaneers a 3-0 lead over the Lions. And Blair Walsh cuts into Green Bay\u2019s lead with a 36-yarder. Vikings 3-7 Packers. Matt Forte atones for his earlier fumble by leading the Bears\u2019 charge straight down the field in St Louis, carrying four times for 58 yards before Josh McCown delivers the ball to tight end Martellus Bennett, who fights his way across the line for a seven-yard score. Well now this is something rather special folks. We\u2019ve had a genuine, confirmed Mike Wallace sighting in Miami, and he\u2019s only gone and scored an actual touchdown! Full credit to the receiver on this play, he had some work to do on an underthrown pass from Ryan Tannehill, but he went up over his defender for a 53-yard score. Everybody\u2019s kicking right now, it seems. Nick Novak converts from 30 yards to make it Chargers 3-0 Chiefs, after Philip Rivers just missed Keenan Allen in the end zone. And Graham Gano\u2019s 52-yarder gives Carolina the lead in Miami. Panthers 3-0 Dolphins. On Twitter, the Manning-Brady debate rumbles on, with several readers now posting the names of players they would take over either quarterback. I\u2019ve had nominations for Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, and, of course, this guy: Freelancing brilliance from Scott Tolzien, who eluded one pass rusher, but still looked set to be tackled for a minimal gain after electing to tuck the ball in and run on second-and-goal at the six. Instead he slipped away from two would-be tacklers once again and wriggled away to the end zone. Elsewhere, I have a couple more field goals to tell you about. It is now Steelers 3-3 Browns and Jets 3-0 Ravens. Only three touchdowns scored so far today, and two of them belong to the St Louis Rams. Matt Forte\u2019s fumble on the Bears\u2019 first offensive play of the game gifted the Rams a short field, and after a pass interference call in the end zone, it got even shorter. Zac Stacy was the man who ploughed across the line from one yard out. Not technically the question I asked, but Brady is coming out as clear winner in the 'who would you prefer to spend time with?' stakes. I suppose it is something you might want to consider as owner of this fictional team. I can't help but feel that some of you people are forgetting Peyton's access to free pizza. And our second touchdown of the day arrives in Houston, where Maurice Jones-Drew piled over the line from one yard after a 50+ yard reception from Chad Henne to the brilliantly named Ace Sanders. Shaun Suisham, meanwhile, has put one through the uprights in Cleveland. Steelers 3-0 Browns. The Tavon Austin show turns out not to have been a one-hit wonder. The Rams were committed to getting their first-round pick more involved in the offense, and Jeff Fisher is not afraid to use a little trickery to make that happen. The receiver looped round the back of the Rams field before taking the ball on a pitch from Kellen Clemens, then spinning 180 degrees to reverse his field and take it up the near sideline for a 65-yard touchdown \u2013 our first of the day. And it wasn't even a figment of a stranger's imagination, either. The games are starting, and so is the Brady v Manning debate. Lots of answers coming in on Twitter already: A few answers, like @MochineGun's , diminishing Brady's achievements in light of SpyGate. Also interested at how many people still deem Brady the winner of clutch games. A better playoff record, for sure, but he's lost a couple of Super Bowls himself, now, too (to Peyton's brother, no less). One other neat subplot to this week\u2019s games is the Long family match-up going down in St Louis. Rams defensive end Chris Long might not quite be lining up opposite his brother Kyle, an offensive guard for the Chicago Bears, but given that they operate on the same side of the line, they are likely to come into contact with each other on at least a few plays. Their father, Howie Long, himself a Hall of Fame defensive end who works as a presenter these days for Fox Sports, will be there to watch it all go down. With both teams still alive in the playoff hunt (albeit the Bears appear a much better bet, at this stage) there will be more than just sibling rivalry driving the two brothers on. Don't forget to make your predictions over on the NFL Talkboard. You've got about 10 minutes left if you want them to be counted in this week's edition of the Pick Six contest. One thing that certainly would help Peyton Manning tonight is having wide receiver Wes Welker available. And you can bet that the receiver himself is anxious to be out there tonight against his former team. Welker\u2019s status has been in doubt all week after he suffered a concussion during the Broncos\u2019 win over Kansas City, but he is all but certain to play tonight after passing the league\u2019s mandated tests. Here\u2019s the other big injury news ahead of this afternoon\u2019s games: - Adrian Peterson and Greg Jennings are both active for the Minnesota Vikings, after being listed as questionable during the week with groin and Achilles injuries respectively - Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata will also play in his team\u2019s game against the Jets. He had been questionable with a knee injury, and his presence should provide a major lift to his team\u2019s run defense. - Pittsburgh\u2019s linebacker Lamarr Woodley and defensive end Brett Keisel are both out of the Steelers\u2019 game in Cleveland. There\u2019s a lot of football to be played before we get to Brady v Manning, of course. This live blog will be focusing on the 1pm ET/6pm GMT match-ups, the full list of which is right here: Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cleveland Browns Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Detroit Lions Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers San Diego Chargers @ Kansas City Chiefs Chicago Bears @ St Louis Rams Carolina Panthers @ Miami Dolphins New York Jets @ Baltimore Ravens Jacksonville Jaguars @ Houston Texans Here we go again. This evening, for the fourteenth time in their respective careers, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning go head-to-head on the gridiron. It is one of the great sporting rivalries of the last two decades, even though the nature of football ensures that these two protagonists never actually take the field at the same time. It is also one of the great bar room debates. Which of Brady or Manning would you want on your team, if you were choosing between the two players in their prime? It is a question that was addressed in the latest issue of Gridiron Magazine, in which nine writers were asked for their opinion, with a further vote given to readers via an online poll. The final decision came in 7-3 in Brady\u2019s favour, although I went the other way. Here was my pick: Brady or Manning? Trophies or touchdowns? The kid who came out of nowhere or the quarterback\u2019s son who exceeded the outlandish expectations put upon him? Most importantly: Ugg boots or Papa John\u2019s pizza? People will say that Brady is more \u2018clutch\u2019, because he has three Super Bowl rings and Manning only has one. But titles belong to teams, not quarterbacks in isolation, and we will never know how many either man would have won if their situations were reversed. But I do know that Manning in his prime threw the prettiest spiral I have ever seen. I would sooner play with him, than against him. So, where do you fall on this old argument? Tom\u2019s trophies or Manning\u2019s magic? Brady\u2019s boots or Peyton\u2019s pizza? Let us know by email on paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk, by Twitter @Paolo_Bandini or in the comments section below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
