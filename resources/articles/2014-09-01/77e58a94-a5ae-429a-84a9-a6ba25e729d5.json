Beckham, who captained England for 59 of his 115 caps, handed over the armband to John Terry in 2006 while Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard also held the role on a permanent basis before Rooney took up the mantle against Norway on Wednesday, scoring the only goal from the penalty spot in a laborious victory in front of a Wembley crowd of 40,181. Rooney proved the match winner but his performance did little to inspire \u2013 he was a shadow of the 17-year-old who scored his first goal for England in 2003 against Macedonia, a match settled by a Beckham penalty. Now 28, Rooney was the obvious choice to succeed Gerrard as captain, not least due to a lack of alternatives available to Hodgson, but Beckham is convinced Rooney is the right man to lead England towards Euro 2016. \u201cWayne will get the best out of the players, he has always played with his heart on his sleeve,\u201d Beckham told the Daily Mail. \u201cHe will work hard, play hard, that\u2019s the way he is and he will lead by example. I never hid as captain and Wayne has never hidden either, even when he has had difficult times on the pitch by not scoring or not had a great game. \u201cI made mistakes when I was captain of the country and did silly things but I grew into it and it made me more mature. \u201cYou realise you have a real responsibility on and off the field. You have to lead by example. \u201cYou will never see him not working. That will be one of his strongest qualities. \u201cRooney is the leader and Roy [Hodgson, manager] has his plans with the players we have. Raheem Sterling is performing at Liverpool and so is Daniel Sturridge. Danny Welbeck is strong too.\u201d England begin their European Championship qualification campaign in Switzerland \u2013 who are currently ranked ninth in the world \u2013 on Monday without Daniel Sturridge and with apprehension after their insipid victory over Norway. Beckham has been seconded to the England backroom staff before, acting as a player liaison for Fabio Capello during the 2010 World Cup after an achilles injury prevented his participation in a playing capacity, but the 39-year-old revealed an approach from Hodgson has not been forthcoming to date. \u201cNo I haven\u2019t [been asked],\u201d he added. \u201cI only retired just over a year ago and obviously I\u2019ve been busy with stuff I\u2019ve been doing but, if I can help in any way for the future of England and the future of English football, I will. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m very proud of. To actually come to the end of my career and be an ambassador for my country around the world. If there was any way in the future, when I\u2019m not as busy, that I can help, then I would be very proud of that.\u201d While Beckham remains out of the England picture, his former team-mate and Class of \u201992 contemporary Gary Neville is among Hodgson\u2019s lieutenants while Ryan Giggs briefly took the reins at Manchester United after the departure of David Moyes last season and is currently Louis van Gaal\u2019s No2 at Old Trafford. And Beckham has not ruled out a future move to the dug-out. \u201cYou never know; it has never really crossed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was to do it in the future, I would do it in the right way. Like Scholesy, Giggsy, Butty, Gary, Phil. That\u2019s the way you have to do it. I have no plans to do it in the next 10 years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
