A start and victory in today's FA Cup final would provide some consolation for Campbell. Yet, as the 30-year-old spoke, he could not be certain of facing Manchester United. Injuries have not just crushed his season but left unfamiliar doubts over his place with club and country. \"I'm ready to play,\" Campbell said, though the indications were last night that he would have to settle for a place on the bench. Never before has he been left out of such a game by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and it would add to his suffering. These are the occasions Campbell relishes and he has unfinished business to attend to. That stems from more than the fury he felt at the penalty Wayne Rooney won against him at Old Trafford in October, when Arsenal's unbeaten run ended. Campbell also missed his club's last FA Cup final, in 2003, because he was banned - unjustly, he felt - for elbowing United's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Campbell was phlegmatic when discussing Rooney's tumble. \"He said 'I know you didn't touch me' but it's one of those things,\" the England international recalled. He added that \"everything's swings and roundabouts\" but the idea of stifling Rooney and lifting the cup must drive him. All the more so after a 4-2 defeat by United in February. The pain for Campbell that night was double. An ankle injury forced him off and he did not play for more than three months, spending several games on the bench as Philippe Senderos performed well, apparently well enough to be selected with Kolo Tour\u00e9 today. That fourth injury of his season was the longest and toughest. \"The game gets me through a lot of things,\" Campbell said. \"That's why I have been suffering. If you're not playing, not training, you have a lot more time to think. Then you start trying to get into other things to occupy your mind, when the main thing is [that] you want to be out there playing. \"I have learned a lot [while injured]. When things are going well, of course everybody loves you. Then when you're not playing all sorts of things go in your mind. It's how strong you are as a person, a human being and a footballer. You need to have that strength within because you can go wayward.\" Strength of character is not something Campbell can be accused of lacking. He had to cope with the vitriol provoked by his move from Tottenham to Arsenal. The pressures of that dwarf his problems while sidelined and have helped him. \"I don't think any player could have gone through what I went through to get through that first year here,\" Campbell said. \"I don't think people give me the respect [I deserve], because I think a lot of people would have cracked. \"Every Tom, Dick and Harry had something to say about it - the media, TV, papers all had their own views, so everybody had a field day and people were chucking more logs on. It was an interesting time but it made me strong. It made me realise what's special in life and real in life, and that's why I just kept to football. \"I think it's valuable experience getting through it. It was hard but now I'm past it. In years to come I'm going to come across new tasks, new challenges. If I can get through that, I can get through pretty much anything.\" Short-term challenges loom, and not just to become indispensable at Arsenal again in the contest with Senderos and Tour\u00e9. As Campbell has suffered a stop-start season, John Terry has excelled at Chelsea, providing stern competition for an England berth. Campbell knows next season is crucial ahead of the World Cup. \"If I'm on the sidelines and I can't play, what can I do?\" he said. \"I've got to be out there playing. Now I'm fit and next season I want to stay fit and then I can play, get into my groove and go from there. \"When I'm focused because there's something special to play for and something to fight for - as the season goes on and then there's the World Cup - sometimes that brings the best out of me.\" The suggestion that he will never recover his best after achilles, calf and ankle problems is summarily rejected. \"I have had bad injuries before and come back strong,\" Campbell said. \"And every top player will go through this.\" He noted he \"played through a lot of pain\" at the end of last season and at Euro 2004 because of his achilles and that he has paid for missing pre-season. Watching Arsenal lose their grip on the title and collapse at Bayern Munich without him must have grated. Campbell's authority and power were missed. \"I hope that I do make a difference,\" he said, \"but, saying that, the team has done well.\" Well, but not well enough so far to match their ambitions. A win today would enable Arsenal to finish on a high and Campbell enjoys the intensity that comes with playing United. \"It's good to have that kind of rivalry,\" he said. \"That keeps football going really, up and down the country.\" Earlier this season Campbell described matches against United as \"more bitter and personal\" and his personal history against them includes a tangle wih Eric Djemba-Djemba in a Community Shield which brought him a \u00a320,000 fine. He hopes his experience will get him a role today, though his memories of games with United this season can hardly be positive. He got a calf injury in the first, an ankle injury in the second, suffered two defeats and conceded that penalty. \"I think this time it's going to be different,\" he said. \"I just feel that. I just feel it's going to be different for me, anyway.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
