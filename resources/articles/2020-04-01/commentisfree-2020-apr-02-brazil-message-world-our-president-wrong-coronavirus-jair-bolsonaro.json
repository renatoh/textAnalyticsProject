And it\u2019s not the virus. Even the most outlandish Hollywood disaster movie wouldn\u2019t entertain the notion of a president who encourages the public to go out more during a public health emergency, as Jair Bolsonaro has done. The Brazilian president has denied the seriousness of coronavirus, rejected the advice of health officials, fought with governors trying to take precautions, put the poor at greatest risk \u2013 and jeopardised a coordinated global response to a threat that might change the course of humanity. Even before the pandemic, Bolsonaro stood out within a group of elected despots \u2013 yet with Covid-19, he has truly surpassed his peers. Donald Trump, despite his initial xenophobic response, has started to recognise the seriousness of the coronavirus. Viktor Orb\u00e1n has used the health emergency as an excuse for a power-grab, but recognises that the virus is a real threat. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro has promoted protests against congress and the supreme court and repeatedly doubled down on denial of coronavirus science: \u201cThis virus isn\u2019t everything they say it is,\u201d he said to supporters on 16 March. According to Imperial College London, the difference between adopting total isolation and not doing so equals one million lives lost in Brazil. Bolsonaro, however, believes only in himself. With him, it\u2019s not about post-truth but self-truth. He goes live on Facebook to discredit scientific research and call coronavirus a \u201clittle flu\u201d or \u201clittle cold\u201d. This week, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram removed coronavirus-related posts from his profile because they spread \u201cdisinformation\u201d and did \u201cactual harm to people\u201d. In March, following Bolsonaro\u2019s visit to his idol Trump, more than 20 people in his entourage tested positive for coronavirus. What did he do? He broke quarantine and headed off to a demonstration against congress and the supreme court. He shook hands and held his supporters\u2019 mobile phones for selfies. \u201cIf I get the virus, the responsibility is mine,\u201d he said. At no point did he stop to think he might infect others. Brazilians do not even know whether Bolsonaro caught Covid-19. He claims he had two negative tests, but refuses to show results. In a nationwide broadcast last week, he urged an end to the isolation advocated by his own government. The next day, followers held rallies across the country calling for businesses to reopen. The already overwhelmed courts had to ban an official proclamation that pushed people to end isolation with these words: \u201cBrazil can\u2019t stop\u201d. It was only this Tuesday that Bolsonaro finally started to accept the crisis is more than \u201cmedia hysteria\u201d. Under pressure from ministers and losing support among his allies, he called the pandemic \u201cthe biggest challenge of our generation\u201d. As he spoke, city streets echoed with protests as those already opting for self-isolation clanged pots and pans and shouted \u201cBolsonaro out!\u201d for the 15th consecutive night. But this doesn\u2019t represent a meaningful U-turn. It just adds to the chaos. Just a few days before, Bolsonaro had visited Bras\u00edlia\u2019s satellite cities and talked to residents about the need to restart the economy. He ramped up the ongoing war against state governors, especially S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s and Rio de Janeiro\u2019s, formerly Bolsonaro\u2019s allies but now declared enemies. On Monday, Jo\u00e3o Doria, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s governor and a 2022 presidential hopeful, enjoined people in Brazil\u2019s richest state: \u201cDon\u2019t follow the advice of the president of the republic!\u201d Bolsonaro behaves like a maniac, but he is calculating. He is gambling with the lives of 210 million Brazilians because he wants to avoid a recession that might undermine his re-election. But the president\u2019s survival chances are diminishing. Many requests have been lodged for his impeachment, and opposition leaders signed a letter calling for his resignation. Even among the staunchest conservatives, a consensus is emerging that he must be isolated. At greatest peril are poor communities, which struggle to self-isolate because of one- and two-room favela homes that often lack plumbed sewage and running water. Social movements have launched campaigns to guarantee basic food and cleaning products for such residents, most of whom are black. \u201cUs for us\u201d is the motto of these organisations that know they cannot rely on a state intent on destroying the public health system, along with labour rights. Bolsonaro had offered informal workers a paltry 200 Brazilian real (\u00a331) a month to see them through the pandemic \u2013 congress finally approved BRL 600 (\u00a393). This is not enough for a population already starting to go hungry and grappling with a dengue epidemic. As elsewhere, the poor have been contaminated by the jet-setting rich. The first death in Rio de Janeiro cast a light on Brazil\u2019s unofficial apartheid: the victim was one of the many housemaids forced to continue working during the pandemic \u2013 her employer had just come back from Italy. After this avoidable tragedy, the children of domestic workers launched an online campaign, \u201cFor our mothers\u2019 lives\u201d. They urged rich employers to support their poor parents so they didn\u2019t need to travel to work during this time of risk. Yet the president is sending exactly the opposite message. Since a virus respects no borders, Bolsonaro is not just a threat to Brazil, but the entire world.
