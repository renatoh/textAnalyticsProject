The Bafokeng \u2013 a Setswana word for \"people of the grass\" \u2013 settled in the region all those centuries ago having noticed the prevalence of an edible grass called the \"phoka\", which enabled them to rear cattle on the land. Nine centuries later and Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and others will benefit from the same land as England prepare to set up base camp at the Bafokeng Sports Campus when they arrive in South Africa tonight, two hours' drive from Johannesburg (although you have to fool the satnav to prevent a long detour through the potholed bush roads). Fabio Capello's squad will train on the A-grade pitches that made Fifa's technical committee declare the Bafokeng turf the best in South Africa. The story of the Royal Bafokeng Nation \u2013 the only South African tribe that managed to keep hold of their land through colonisation and apartheid \u2013 with a population of only 300,000 was hardly known when England came calling. Now, through England's association with the place, the whole world seems to know the name. Media groups trawl the hotel and sports complex on a daily basis taking photographs of the pool in which David Beckham may lounge, while hacks speculate over controversies such as whether Capello will accept the presidential suite or not. The spotlight on this small homeland in the North West Province, turned wealthy through the discovery of platinum on the land \u2013 the slagheaps of which are visible from the hotel sun loungers \u2013 has turned the community upside down. Martin Bekker, the royal speech writer and academic researcher for King Kgosi Leruo Molotlegi, has been appointed the role of doubling up as the PR person nominated to deal with hundreds of international media enquiries concerning the minutiae of everything from the size of Capello's bed to where the Wags will reside. \"It's been a ride,\" Bekker says with a wry smile. \"Everyone wants to know what Wayne Rooney is going to have for breakfast and if we can click into that it can be a good thing \u2013 in January no one had heard of Bafokeng. Now through the England team people are slowly, subliminally getting to know us.\" Bekker makes it clear that the sports campus was not built specifically for the English FA, but that the governing body had an involvement from early on. \"After the Confederations Cup Fifa said the pitch [in the Royal Bafokeng Stadium] was the best in the tournament. That created a big interest from organisations such as the FA who asked, \"can you replicate this for a training pitch?\" That spawned the idea of creating a sports complex.\" The pitches themselves have undergone a complex process to reach Fifa standards. Bekker explained how Kikuyu grass \u2013 a particularly hardy variety that originates in Kenya and can grow an inch a day \u2013 was sowed first. Once the Kikuyu was established it was scarified and rye grass seed sown over the top, with the new grass using the old root system of the Kikuyu to hook into new baby roots. \"This wasn't built specifically for the England team, or even for a football team,\" Bekker says, \"but we walked this road [of building it] with the FA and it was handy to have their guidance. Once they arrive here England will take over the complex completely, and make their own security arrangements.\" The concept of having a sports stadium in Bafokeng began with the former King, Kgosi Edward Lebone Molotlegi, who put plans in motion for an Olympic-size football stadium during the 1980s. \"Everyone thought he was bonkers,\" Bekker says. \"This was a time of deepest, darkest apartheid. But the King said that one day a big tournament will come to South Africa and he wanted to make sure that it came to their land.\" And so it has. The Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace will host England's first fixture against the USA along with four other group games and one match from the round of 16. Despite being located in the region's captital, Phokeng, Fifa has unfairly insisted on referring to the stadium location as Rustenburg, which lies further south. That is not the only injustice. The current King, a football fan who grew up watching Liverpool in the 1970s and 80s, has hopes about what the World Cup can do to improve living standards for the local community. But those hopes are not always in tandem with Fifa's ideas, the rule about all businesses within a quarter mile of the stadium not conflicting with Fifa-approved sponsors already causing problems for the local traders whose vegetable stalls spill over the sidewalk, or for the small shopping centre that lies adjacent to the stadium. Still the sports complex will have a life, and an income, long after Capello's men have triumphed or failed. It includes a rugby pitch, an athletics track and tennis courts, to attract sports teams and individuals from all parts of the globe to come to South Africa for warm weather training. In the totemic tradition the Bafokeng have a crocodile as its symbol, the image of which is depicted on the seats of the stadium, and around the sports campus. \"Their motto is, 'a e wele mo metsing'\", Bekker says, \"'let there be peace'.\" Along with first-class pitches, the crocodile with its closed mouth \u2013 symbolising controlled aggression \u2013 may be just the quality Capello needs in his team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
