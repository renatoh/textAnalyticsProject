Obviously there are the routine car, train and plane crashes mixed with pavement tumbling, falling masonry and muggings. But what makes a city just that bit more exciting is the other ways - injuring yourself on the top of the superstructure of a bridge, being nibbled by a shark, breaking your arms surfing. Add to that various other hazards: dangerous snakes, spiders, bugs, as well as a high potential for alcohol poisoning, and you could soon be on first-name terms with your surgeon. Happily, not everyone meets every hazard while visiting Sydney - although I managed three visits to the medic - and I would guess most come away as PR reps for a city which seems to have it all and more. There is the hassle-free, convenient travel, bars and restaurants to the rafters, stunning scenery and a climate to enjoy it in. Added to that, you have the \"can-do\" attitude of its residents and a genuine friendliness. Within days of arriving, you start thinking of emigrating. Sydney is a huge playground for four million people who mix the inconvenience of work with the pleasure of an active, outdoor lifestyle. It lives for its harbour, its beaches and its food - and there is a lot of all three. People here have done a lot of thinking about living. At first it seems so simple. You look around and see order: clean streets, manicured parks, new roads that dart under and around huge glass skyscrapers, buses and ferries coming and going on time. But look at other cities and you see what happens when it doesn't all work. With Sydney, Australians have a gem. The Olympics in 2000 merely polished it up a bit, allowed investment to enhance what was already natural beauty. Sure, the New South Wales capital can't compete with the cultural overload that some cities in Europe and Asia provide. But it has its fair share of galleries, a healthy film and theatre industry and some outstanding architecture. The city is dominated by icons of Australia: the Opera House is simply stunning - a beauty spot on a beautiful face. It's a weird thing that building - as familiar as your own home yet at the same time it startles each time you look at it. You almost expect it to be two dimensional - a sort of giant postcard propped up from behind. It nestles on a peninsula a few hundred metres from that other outstanding construction feat, the Harbour Bridge. If you are vaguely brave, you can climb the bridge - up the arches to the very top, 134m above the harbour. It is a spectacular way to see the city as well as admire the 70-year-old industrial craftsmanship - all six million rivets and 52,800 tonnes of steel. Away from these two, the city offers pretty much everything for the hedonist. Good restaurants and bars pop up in perfect settings - almost as if the vistas were created to be viewed from behind a table and a frosty beer glass. Take your choice from trendy urban caf\u00e9s in the Darlinghurst or edgy Kings Cross areas, or top-class beachside restaurants in Bondi and Balmoral. In surprising places you find surprising places. At the magnificent Finger Wharf Bay in the Woolloomooloo district, a massive old wharf has been gutted and transformed into a complex that houses a unique hotel, called W, and provides a venue for six restaurants that look on to million-dollar yachts and their owners. And where you find food, you often find shopping. The Central District is pretty much stuffed full of shops from the trendy boutiques in Paddington's Oxford Street to the more mainstream Pitt St Mall. Away from the city bustle, there are the beaches - and this is where your hospital visits begin. Beaches are what Australians seem to live for and consequently are clean and well stocked with bars, restaurants and all the paraphernalia of surfing life. The less famous beaches, such as Balmoral and Chinaman's Beach, are more quiet - save for the occasional scream of a jellyfish-sting victim (that was my first hospital visit: bluebottle jellyfish attack followed by anaphylactic shock). Bondi, the celebrated patch of sand on the south side of Sydney is still a pull for locals and tourists. But it can get busy leading to surfer logjams and accidents. (My second visit to a medic followed a surfboard-in-the-eye incident during Bondi rush hour.) Bronte Beach, to the south near Bondi, is for the experienced surfer - all crashing breakers and strong currents. The third way to get to hospital is to enjoy the sun too much and then use foreign shaving cream, which reacts with your newly-burnt face. This leads to jellyfish-style face bubbling and another hospital bill. Needless to say, over-sunning is a peculiarly British disease. Sydney folk live with their weather and know how to deal with it. Their winters are like our cold summers, their summers like real summers should be - temperatures reaching 40C. When it's really hot, the wealthier Sydney residents retreat to their cool bungalows in exclusive Mosman and Cremorne districts on the north side of the harbour, or Vaucluse on the south side, spark up the barbecues, drink chilled wine and take a dip in the pool. Obviously, there is a downside to Sydney. You need to spend a day flying out, and about \u00a3700 return for the privilege. But that's about it. With an exchange rate of around $2.6 dollars to \u00a31, you also feel about twice as rich as back home. Which is just as well if you spend half the time in taxis shuttling to the medical centre. Four things you must do in Sydney... Eat Bondi * Jackie's (corner of Warners Ave and Wairoa Ave). A cool place to eat with a trendy bar. Good seafood - A$50-60 a head for dinner. * Lamrock (Campbell Parade). For a drink and a snack. Cold beers, wines and burgers, including veggie versions, for around A$15. Balmoral Beach * The Awaba Caf\u00e9 (100 yards from Balmoral Beach). A great place for breakfast. Muesli, orange juice and a latte for two comes to A$25. * The Bathers' Pavilion (on the beach). Spectacular harbour view - good for sun up and down. Dinner for two in the caf\u00e9 is about A$70-80 with a glass of wine or two. Circular Quay The hub of Sydney, from where ferries come and go through the hours. It is lined with waterfront bars and restaurants. City * Finger Wharf Bay (Cowper Wharf Roadway, Woolloomooloo). Restaurants range from Japanese to seafood and traditional fare. Mantaray restaurant is particularly good: massive portions of crab, lobster and all types of fish; around $80 a head with wine. * Morgans (304 Victoria St). In the Darlinghurst district; great caf\u00e9 for breakfast and watching the world. Lunch and dinner served - the latter A$40-60. * Aria (19/2 Circular Quay East, Circular Quay). Great views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Fish is its forte: pan-fried snapper with prawn colcannon. All lovely but pricey - A$100 a head. Manly: A cosmopolitan outrider only 25 minutes on the ferry from the city centre. Loads of beachside caf\u00e9s and restaurants on North Steyne Road, from where you can watch the surfers. See The Bridge Climb: A unique experience that takes around four hours. You are kitted up with overalls and safety harnesses and walk up the superstructure of the bridge (above right) to the top for amazing views. The climb costs between A$125-170. Afterwards, go for a swim at the North Sydney Olympic Pool, which is outdoors and located next to the Bridge. The Opera House and Botanical Gardens: The J\u00f8rn Utzon-designed building is a busy working entertainment centre hosting not only operas but, theatre, concerts, films and ballet. The Botanical gardens include palm groves and stunning harbour views a superb collection of tropical plants and, bizarrely, the colony's first vegetable patch. Walk Two particularly good strolls: from Bondi Beach to Bronte beach takes around 30 minutes and has good clifftop views. Be careful at Bronte, which has strong undercurrents. Also on the south side of the harbour, a trip through Vaucluse - a particularly posh suburb - is worthwhile. You can walk along the foreshore from Hermit Bay to Vaucluse Bay through the Sydney Harbour National Park. Shop * The Rocks. Old Sydney with the usual retail tricks of souvenir shops and tacky memorabilia, but there are good caf\u00e9s to be visited and a few fun shops. * Pitt Street Mall. The main shopping area in the city has all the usual fare plus the obligatory didgeridoo sellers. * Oxford Street. In the Paddington district - Sydney's answer to Notting Hill. Full of designer shops. * Useful website: sydney.citysearch.com.au Way to go Travelbag (0870 7377779) offers seven nights' B&amp;B at Southern Cross hotel in Sydney and return flights with Sri Lanka airways for \u00a3737pp (two sharing) until July 10. Price includes a harbour cruise. Useful site: www.visitnsw.com.au."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
