Rice was shot dead by a police officer last November. When he was shot, Rice was holding a toy gun that police mistook for a real firearm. The incident sparked widespread criticism that officer Timothy Loehmann, who killed Rice, employed a drastic overuse of force. The city of Cleveland\u2019s defense, filed with the US district court on Friday, argues that both Rice and members of his family are to blame for any damages, injuries and losses arising from the incident. The argument lists 20 lines of defence, including that Rice did not \u201cexercise due care to avoid injury\u201d and that members of his family, including his mother and teenage sister, who have lodged the claim, sustained damages \u201ccaused by their own acts\u201d. Video footage of the incident outside the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland was obtained by local media under freedom of information laws. It shows Rice\u2019s 14-year-old sister pushed to ground, handcuffed and taken to the back of a patrol car after arriving on the scene and seeing her brother lying in front of her. The plaintiffs argue in a submission that was revised at the end of January, after the family took on a new legal team, that the 14-year-old screamed \u201cmy baby brother, they killed my baby brother\u201d before she was tackled to the ground by officers. The lawsuit also claims that Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, did not administer first aid to the 12-year-old as he lay bleeding. It was four minutes until another law enforcement official arrived on the scene and administered medical assistance, the submission claims. The city\u2019s list of 20 defenses does not go into detail. A request for further comment from the Guardian on Sunday was not responded to by deadline. The 41-page response frequently cites an ongoing police investigation, conducted by the Cuyahoga sheriff\u2019s office in Ohio, as reason for not responding in full. The Cuyahoga sheriff\u2019s office did not respond for a request for comment on the expected date of the investigation\u2019s completion. The plaintiffs also argue that Loehmann should not have been employed by Cleveland police, after he had been judged unfit for service by another department two years previously. Loehmann\u2019s personnel file from November 2012, first reported by local media, found the officer \u201ccould not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal\u201d. The city of Cleveland\u2019s response to this argument is that it is \u201cwithout knowledge or information sufficient\u201d to assess the claims. Walter Madison, one of the Rice family\u2019s legal team, told NBC news the plaintiffs maintained the 12 year-old was \u201cshot and killed unnecessarily\u201d and that his \u201cdeath at the hands of an unfit police officer(s) and a division of police that continues to endorse their behavior led to our legitimate lawsuit\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
