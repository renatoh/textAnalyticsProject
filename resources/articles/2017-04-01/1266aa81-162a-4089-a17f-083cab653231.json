Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen sealed what may yet prove to be a vital three points with goals in the last few minutes as Spurs left it late to reply to Wayne Routledge\u2019s first-half opener. Son\u2019s goal saw Tottenham\u2019s players celebrate wildly before Eriksen set the seal on a dramatic victory that leaves Pochettino\u2019s side seven points behind Chelsea following the league leaders\u2019 win against Manchester City. The Spurs manager said: \u201cI believe we can win every game if we play like this evening and then we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s important to go game by game. We missed some players here but the collective spirit was fantastic. \u201cThe win happened because we never gave up; we tried, tried and tried. Our play deserved the win because it was a difficult game. It was tough because they are difficult to break down.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s win was a fine riposte to the Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, who suggested this week that Tottenham lack the winning mentality found inside the Stamford Bridge dressing room. Chelsea remain overwhelming favourites in the title race, but Pochettino\u2019s manic celebrations in front of the away end at full time showed he is up for the fight. \u201cI respect Antonio Conte very much. I didn\u2019t hear him say that, but it\u2019s true if you compare us with Chelsea in the last 10 years, Chelsea have won titles and we haven\u2019t,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cTo create the winning mentality you need this type of game, belief, and you need time. It\u2019s important to show that we learned, because maybe last season this was a game we would\u2019ve lost.\u201d Spurs were without their captain, Hugo Lloris, who pulled out due to illness before kick-off, and the injured Victor Wanyama. Both players are expected to be in contention to face Watford at White Hart Lane on Saturday. Pochettino added: \u201cWe hope Hugo will be well again. Victor wasn\u2019t 100% to be in the team or on the bench, but we hope to have him back on the weekend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
