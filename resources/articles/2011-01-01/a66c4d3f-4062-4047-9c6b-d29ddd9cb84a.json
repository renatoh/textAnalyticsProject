Particularly, their walloped cowbells, post-punk guitars and jerky beats recall the mid-2000s punk-funk boom, with the opener New York City Moves to the Sound of LA a very close relation to the Rapture's House of Jealous Lovers. Deja vu aside, it's certainly hard not to be moved towards the dancefloor by Car Wars's strolling disco basslines, and their sheer intensity makes a exhausted style sound thrilling again. This is a band who don't know how to slow things down, hitting everything at the same high-octane pace, whether chanted vocals, frazzled walls of noise or drifts towards Killers-style epic rock. It does start to get wearying after a while, which makes the slower, moodier Relics to Ruins a change of gear that should perhaps occur more often."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
