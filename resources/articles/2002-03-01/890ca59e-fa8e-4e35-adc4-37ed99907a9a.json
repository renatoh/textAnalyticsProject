In the wider context, however, these rivals are not as closely matched in terms of Premiership ambitions. Wolves will be promoted this season; Birmingham may make the play-offs. But the omens for Steve Bruce's Blues project are good. Dave Jones has had a year start over Birmingham's manager and Bruce believes he knows why his Wolves counterpart has succeeded. \"Wolves and Manchester City are both up already in my opinion,\" Bruce said. \"They have the best squads, the most players with Premiership experience and have spent the most money. It's that simple; there's no secret recipe.\" Bruce gave credit to Jones and Kevin Keegan on their player purchases and, three months after taking over, his Birmingham squad is still work in progress. But his targets have sampled the top flight and money is available. Birmingham showed another important asset in coming back from two goals down to earn a draw - self-belief. Where they seemed deficient next to Wolves was in the number of robust leaders the visitors had on the pitch. Paul Butler, the Wolves captain who opened the scoring with his first goal for the club, said that this had been a vital part of their improvement. \"We have some fiery characters in the team like Alex Rae, Nathan Blake and Kevin Muscat and it's hard to keep a lead on them all the time,\" Butler said. \"But their presence is why we are where we are and I wouldn't swap it for anything else. When the chips are down it's what you need. \"We know when we've played bad and when we've conceded sloppy goals and the lads will tell each other and that's what you need. The manager can dish it out as well but he knows when to keep quiet and we all do a lot of the talking now. It's a dressing room full of character, confidence and a hell of a lot of pride.\" A dent was put in this by Birmingham's stirring recovery after conceding two sloppy goals within half an hour. First Mark Kennedy's free-kick to the far post was headed in by Butler after token resistance from his marker Tommy Mooney. Kennedy then repeated the trick to supply Joleon Lescott, who beat Birmingham's goalkeeper Ian Bennett to head home. Crucially, the home side were level by the interval. A wayward Muscat header after 36 minutes fell to Stern John, whose shot passed tamely under the body of the Wolves goalkeeper Michael Oakes, and in the final minute of first-half stoppage time Paul Devlin astutely volleyed Martin Grainger's cross into the far corner. John had three chances in the second half to give Birmingham the lead but twice diverted crosses straight at the goalkeeper, then hit a volley wide. It may be a while before Wolves and Birmingham meet again but, if Bruce fails, he will at least know where he has gone wrong. Man of the match: Joleon Lescott (Wolves). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
