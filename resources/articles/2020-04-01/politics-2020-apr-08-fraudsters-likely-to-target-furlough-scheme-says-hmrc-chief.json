The job retention scheme, which pays 80% of an employee\u2019s salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for up to three months, is due to come online for employers to make claims on 20 April. Jim Harra, the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, told a committee of MPs that he expected it to be targeted by fraudsters. \u201cWe are going to be paying out a vast sum of money in a rapid period of time,\u201d Harra told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. \u201cAny scheme like this is a target for organised crime. Any scheme that pays out I\u2019m afraid attracts criminals that want to defraud it and people that are genuinely entitled to it who inflate their claims.\u201d Anthony Browne, a Tory member of the committee, asked Harra how far the scheme was \u201copen to abuse\u201d, saying he had seen estimates that the government could end out paying \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn, although City economists have put a potentially far higher figure on the cost. Harra said HMRC had four \u201clines of defence\u201d to stop fraudsters, including a whistleblower hotline. A key safeguard is the stipulation that an employee has to have been on a payroll on 28 February in order to claim, which should prevent the creation of claims using fake employees. Other measures include: The requirement for an employer to have already been authenticated by HMRC. A four- to six-day processing period to make background checks, which should flag high-risk claims. Checks made after payout to verify a claim was real. \u201cWe have to get a scheme set up rapidly and time has been the enemy of perfection in this,\u201d Harra said. \u201cWe believe we are striking the right balance protecting the exchequer from abuse and the imperative to get help out to those that need it as fast as we possibly can.\u201d Harra said he had a \u201chigh level of confidence\u201d that the online system being set up to take employer claims would not crash. HMRC said it had begun testing the system on Wednesday with a \u201csmall number of invited employers\u201d before the full launch on 20 April. \u201cWe are confident that the IT will cope with the very large volume of claims we expect to receive,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the IT side we have tested up to 450,000 claims an hour.\u201d He admitted that if a very large number of employers phoned HMRC for help, its call centres \u201cwould struggle to provide the service we want\u201d. Harra said there were about 2,000 staff already dedicated to the helplines, and another 3,500 other employees would be redeployed to help deal with the huge number of claims expected when the service launches. In terms of numbers of claimants, Harra said there were about 2 million PAYE schemes in the UK, with some employers using more than one scheme, covering about 30 million employees. He did not know the expected level of claimants, although there have been estimates of a minimum of 10% of employers. \u201cWe expect a very large number of those to claim in the first few days,\u201d he said. \u201cClaimants will be queued if necessary \u2013 anyone who has tried to get online shopping will know what that is like \u2013 but claims can be made online 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
