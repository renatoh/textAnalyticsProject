That trial is scheduled to begin today. It was not clear if Montgomery would have to serve prison time because of the guilty plea. The 32-year-old was charged last year along with Riddick and 11 others in an alleged conspiracy to deposit $5m (\u00a32.55m) in stolen, altered or counterfeit cheques over three years at several banks. Montgomery set the 100m world record in 2002 and was a member of the US gold medal-winning 400m relay team at the 2000 Olympics. He retired in 2005 after he was banned from athletics by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for doping linked to the investigation of the San Francisco-area based Balco laboratory, which was the focus of a US government investigation into doping in sports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
