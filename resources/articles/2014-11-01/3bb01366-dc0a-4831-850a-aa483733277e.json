The group\u2019s management standards committee (MSC), set up to internally investigate business practices in the wake of the allegations, believed that by handing material on individual employees to the police a wider corporate charge could be avoided, it was alleged. The court also heard that two former Sun editors, Rebekah Brooks and Dominic Mohan, were responsible for signing off on requests for cash payments to confidential sources. The claims were made at the trial of six Sun and former Sun journalists accused of paying public officials for confidential information. All six deny the charges. Mark Kandiah, a detective superintendant, now retired, told Kingston crown court that emails were handed to police by the MSC who \u201cwere clearly concerned with what they were finding\u201d. He told the court he had two or three meetings with the MSC, who were initially cooperative but became less so. He was being questioned by Nigel Rumfitt QC, representing the Sun\u2019s head of news, Chris Pharo. When asked by Rumfitt if the motivation of the MSC stemmed partly from News International having \u201csuffered a huge hit to its reputation\u201d following allegations over the hacking of the phone of Milly Dowler, Kandiah replied: \u201cThey were certainly cooperative.\u201d Cross-examining, Rumfitt asked: \u201cAnd they were also very anxious that the extent of the wrongdoing within the organisation might lead to News Corporation being prosecuted?\u201d Kandiah said: \u201cCertainly as time went on that became more and more of an issue.\u201d Rumfitt said: \u201cIn slang, they were shopping their own staff.\u201d The court heard that documents allegedly showing Brooks and Mohan signed off requests for cash payments were shown to Kandiah. One was an email allegedly sent by Graham Dudman, managing editor, to a number of journalists in 2006 which said: \u201cwith immediate effect no cash payments will be made without Rebekah\u2019s written approval\u201d. Kandiah said he had never seen it. Brooks was cleared in June of agreeing illegal payments. Rumfitt argued that there was no deal with the police saying the firm would escape corporate charges in exchange for information on individual employees. \u201cNews International may have convinced themselves of that position, but that was not something told to them by police?\u201d Kandiah agreed. The company later received a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service in May 2012 telling them that corporate liability, and so a prosecution, was a possibility, the jury heard. Lord Grabiner, chairman of the MSC, appeared to have been proceeding on the assumption there would be no corporate charges, said Rumfitt. Minutes of a meeting in June 2012 with the MSC and Met police indicated Grabiner was not sure the firm would have assisted \u201cif they had been told this last year\u201d. Rumfitt continued: \u201cIt appears from what he was saying he was under the impression that by cooperating in that way they might be able to stave off prosecution.\u201d Kandiah replied: \u201cIt appears so.\u201d Rumfitt read out minutes of another meeting between the MSC and police citing News Corp\u2019s lawyer Gerson Zweifach. The note read: \u201c[A prosecution] could kill the corporation and 46,000 jobs would be at jeopardy.\u201d The 46,000 jobs referred to were in the US, said Rumfitt. \u201cThe point he was making was that if the company was charged, rather than individual employees, that could have a regulatory impact in the United States and they could withdraw certain licences and the company could go bust.\u201d Kandiah replied: \u201cThat is correct, sir.\u201d The officer said that at the height of Operation Elveden, the police investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials, 70 officers were employed \u2013 more than than twice the size of a murder team \u2013 with in excess of 100 suspects \u2013 journalists, journalist managers and public officials. The jury heard the MSC altered its attitude after the first Elveden arrests were made, telling the police in February 2012 that the kind of material that had been handed over was \u201cjournalistic in nature and held in confidence\u201d. Kandiah said there was no direct evidence of the MSC refusing to cooperate and no suggestion it had \u201cfiddled\u201d with the documents it provided. Pharo, former managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll, 38, reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51, former reporter John Troup, 49, and picture editor John Edwards, 50, all deny conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.
