As Los Angeles fire chief Daryl Osby took the podium, strong gusts swirled smoke, ash and dust through grey skies. Along with updates on progress in fighting the fire, he said this blaze signified a shift: fire crews are now facing the most erratic and challenging fight of their lives. Climate change, Osby said, was undeniably a part of why the fires burning in northern and southern California were more devastating and destructive than in years past. The death toll stood at 25: two in the LA-area fires, 23 around the destroyed town of Paradise 500 miles to the north. The total was expected to rise. \u201cThe fact of the matter is if you look at the state of California, climate challenge is happening statewide,\u201d Osby said, adding that \u201cit is going to be here for the foreseeable future\u201d. Drought conditions have increasingly affected the state over the past decade, causing erratic fire behavior and making efforts to contain the flames much more difficult. The Woolsey fire, which was only 10% contained on Sunday, has burned more than 87,000 acres in three days. More than 177 homes have been lost and officials said that number was expected to rise rapidly. The fire season, which started in early summer, is poised to break records for a second year in a row. In July California\u2019s outgoing governor, Jerry Brown, referred to megafires as the \u201cnew normal\u201d. After the press conference, Osby told the Guardian environmental changes had expanded fire season across the state. Crucially, this has put a crunch on resources. For an immediate example, the Camp fire in the north, which devastated Paradise, has diverted resources that drier areas of southern California could once rely on for backup. \u201cIt did have an affect on our strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cTypically we would rely on our partners to the north to come. But they are fighting a major fire up there.\u201d Southern California fire crews therefore only had capacity to focus on saving lives and structures as the fire moved and were unable to work on containing the flames for three days. According to Cal Fire chief Scott Jalbert, there was a window on Saturday when the winds died down and firefighters were able to make some progress. But with strong winds projected through the beginning of the new week, containing the fire will be more difficult. \u201cThey took as much advantage as they could,\u201d he said, but \u201cwith these winds, 30-40mph, it is going to cause a lot of problems\u201d. He added that aircraft will be less affective at aiming retardant. \u201cYou can imagine dropping a cup of water into these winds. It goes all over the place.\u201d With help coming from Arizona, Utah, Nevada and Washington, Osby said fire crews would have the support they need to stop the flames from spreading. \u201cWhat really hampered our ability to combat this fire is we didn\u2019t have enough resources for containment,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally we would do all three things simultaneously but now we have to do it in sequential order. Lives are first.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
