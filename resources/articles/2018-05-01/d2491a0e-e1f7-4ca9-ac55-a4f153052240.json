Nurses from outside the European Economic Area should no longer have to pay the \u00a3200-a-year surcharge now levied on all such migrants, as well as their spouses and children, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). The charge, introduced in 2015, is due to rise to \u00a3400 later this year to raise more money for the NHS. The increased charges are expected to generate \u00a3220m a year. The RCN highlighted the case of Evaline Omondi, a Kenyan nurse working in Luton, whose children had to return to her homeland because the surcharge proved too costly. She was told to pay \u00a33,600 to ensure that she, her partner and four children could receive NHS care free at the point of use during her three-year stint working in the NHS. \u201cThe introduction of the surcharge fee was an awful moment,\u201d Omondi said. \u201cThe fees had to be paid immediately, so we had to take out loans to cover them, which still affect my family to this day. \u201cBut on top of the visa charges, and childcare costs, we could not meet the cost and my children had to move back to Kenya. A family who came together is now in pieces, scattered all over the place.\u201d There are nearly 25,000 nurses from outside the EU working in the NHS in England, including 17,448 of Asian origin \u2013 mainly Filipino or Indian \u2013 and 6,889 from Africa. That is more than the 21,000 nurses from EU countries. Anyone from outside the EEA coming to live in Britain for six months or more to work, study or spend time with relatives has to pay the surcharge. Ministers say it represents migrants\u2019 \u201cfair contribution to [financing the NHS\u2019s] long-term sustainability\u201d. Janet Davies, the chief executive of the RCN, said that after the Windrush scandal \u201cit is shameful that families are being torn apart by this policy too \u2013 uprooting children from their family, friends and school\u201d. She also urged ministers to rule out the surcharge being extended to EU nurses after Brexit. \u201cI say to the government today: these people keep the NHS running,\u201d added Davies, who will highlight the RCN\u2019s call at its annual conference in Belfast on Sunday. \u201cThey are the very last people who should ever be sent upfront invoices for healthcare. \u201cThe government must not put Spanish, Portuguese or Italian colleagues through the same after Brexit.\u201d However, Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, left open the possibility that new EU migrants arriving in Britain after Brexit might have to pay the surcharge in a parliamentary answer earlier this month. Defending the decision to double the surcharge in February, Nokes said: \u201cIt is only right that people who come to the UK should contribute to the running of the NHS. The surcharge offers access to healthcare services that are far more comprehensive and at a much lower cost than many other countries.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThis is yet more evidence of how Theresa May\u2019s \u2018hostile environment\u2019 is damaging patient care. \u201cIt makes no sense at all that under this government\u2019s immigration rules nurses and other NHS workers are effectively having to pay to come and work here from overseas.\u201d The Home Office said: \u201cThe government fully recognises the contribution that international professionals make to the UK and to our health service. \u201cThe surcharge offers access to health care services that are far more comprehensive and at a much lower cost than many other countries. \u201cThe income generated goes directly to NHS services, helping to protect and sustain our world-class healthcare system for everyone who uses it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
