But surely if there is a hell mouth on the wall next to a creepy painting that keeps shifting in the night, it would be worth asking reception. Or going full Joyce Byers and hacking at the wall with an axe and stringing up fairy lights the better to communicate with the disturbed entities trapped inside. In Black Lake (Saturday, BBC Four), however, Minnie did neither. Instead, she returned to bed and pulled a pillow over her head. We have all been there this January, am I right? She wasn\u2019t sure if all the uncanny things she had experienced \u2013 hellmouth, wailing child, bumps in the night, corpse in the water, shattering glass, the unacceptably stary eyes of that hideous guitar-playing figurine \u2013 were real or hallucinations. I can confirm that the excitable, over-buff shaman of a therapy guru, Uno, was haunted with something \u2013 though nothing decaf wouldn\u2019t cure. Nor, for seven and a half episodes, could Minnie solve the riddle of Room 5. Its door was locked following the disappearance of a guest called Josefine last year in circumstances That No One Would Discuss. Weeks later, Josefine\u2019s daughter had been kidnapped in Stockholm, possibly by her mother. Either that or Josefine had been bumped off, the latest victim of ye olde horror genre device \u2026 an ancient curse that could be appeased only with sacrificial human blood. All of which would do little, you would think, for the island\u2019s TripAdvisor rating. I made the mistake initially of taking Black Lake seriously. I took it for Bergman when it was I Know What You Did Last Summer with subtitles. Or Agatha Christie without Miss Marple to bring closure. Like Love Island, I\u2019m A Celebrity and every other haunted-house horror, Black Lake trapped a bunch of libidinous hotties with diverting backstories (Amina the sex addict, Vincent the violent ex-con, Oscar the disturbed introvert, Johan with his daddy fixation) somewhere from which they couldn\u2019t escape. Then its makers took away TV and broadband with the glee of Big Brother\u2019s producers putting contestants on rations, sat back and waited for the drama to go all Sodom, Gomorrah and Lord of the Flies. The problem with Black Lake, though, was that it didn\u2019t degenerate far enough: it could have plumbed the existential depths but instead it floated, like that corpse, in the shallows. Minnie\u2019s problem was that she needed to keep shtoom about her hallucinations. Why? Because she was taking part in this retreat to prove she, a recovering drug addict, was in a fit state to look after her daughter. Blabbing might make her sound too bonkers to warrant custody. Only in the last 15 minutes of the final episode did we find out the truth. Minnie wasn\u2019t bonkers, but Bella, with the headscarf collection and interesting mascara, was. As happens in bad drama, Bella flipped as the denouement approached from improbably sweet and mild-mannered into misogynistically conceived psychopath, like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction and Rebecca de Mornay circa The Hand that Rocks the Cradle. But why? Spurned by Uno and his beard, traumatised by something that happened when she was 17 that we can\u2019t get into right now, Bella had last year murdered Josefine, kidnapped Elsa and hidden the child away from prying eyes, ultimately in the island\u2019s lighthouse. The following year, Bella returned to the retreat with new headscarves and the hots for the buff but otherwise boring business drone Johan. How Bella managed to look after Elsa, while having it off with Johan and taking part in a taxing daily programme of therapeutic group activities, was beyond me. And, indeed, perhaps beyond narrative logic. No matter. Minnie found out just before the end credits that not everything weird she had experienced was a hallucination. She stumbled across Josefine\u2019s abducted daughter in her lighthouse prison, only to be confronted and stabbed by the now demented Bella. Escaping to the lighthouse roof, Minnie collapsed looking wan and fetching though, you would imagine, fatally wounded. Not so. She rallied, rescued the girl, witnessed Uno get fatally stabbed by the full-on bonkers Bella and fled to the beach to be saved by Johan, who, though buff and boring, had undergone an unconvincing yacht-based spiritual epiphany and returned to be the hero. In the last shot, Minni\u2019es daughter came racing across tarmac to her mother strapped to a gurney, the suggestion being that, having saved one little girl from a psychopath, Minnie could now be a proper mother to her own child. None of it stood up to a moment\u2019s analysis. Even so, I know what I am going to do this summer. I\u2019m going on retreat. This happens after I watch Swedish dramas: I plan holidays. I have yearned to tour murder sites with Kurt Wallander, and go on a road trip with Saga Nor\u00e9n, Malm\u00f6 PD, in her Porsche. Now I want to stay in Room 5 of Black Lake\u2019s lovely house, make bivouacs with sexy Swedish neurotics, analyse my psychic wounds and have a no-strings thing with the pigtailed functionary. After all, the island is no longer cursed and so is safe for visitors: Uno the dodgy therapist is dead, the mystery solved and the hellmouth has healed over. Kallsk\u00e4r! Unless you are fictional, I am heading to you for my treatment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
