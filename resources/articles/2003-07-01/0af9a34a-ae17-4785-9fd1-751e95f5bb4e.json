Yell's flotation is not, however, expected to herald a deluge of public offerings. Forecasters reckon that the stock market will remain volatile. The firm is viewed as exceptionally strong, which explains its willingness to take the plunge. Food group RHM, the former Rank Hovis McDougall, which cancelled its planned float before the Iraq war, is in no hurry to try again. 'Barring a significant upswing in share prices, RHM will not list this year,' said Michael Schurch, its finance director. RHM was acquired by the Tomkins conglomerate for \u00a3935m in 1992. Eight years later, as the Tomkins empire began to unravel, RHM was sold to Doughty Hanson, the venture capitalists, for \u00a31.2bn. One banker, looking at the whole market, said: 'Some good businesses will be got away, but I am not convinced we are about to see a flood.' Focus Wickes, the DIY chain, has decided not to dust down its planned float, which it abandoned in 2002, when war in Iraq appeared inevitable. The Yell float will be the largest public offering in London this year. The price will be towards the top end of the range after a good response from City institutions. Chief executive John Condron and representatives of advisers Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch flew to New York to woo American investors this weekend. They will pay a similar visit to Edinburgh on their return. Cantor Index is already making a grey market in the shares. It was quoting a spread of 280p to 290p on Friday, towards the top end of the pricing range of 250p to 300p. Others expect the banks to set the price a little above the mid-point of 275p to ensure that it gets away this time. Yell pulled its first planned float exactly a year ago following a stock market collapse. The new one is only the second to test the market since it recovered from its low point ahead of the war. The company is the largest to float for some time. Investors in London who have already met its bosses and advisers say they were impressed by the business. Mike Felton, head of UK equities at ISIS, pointed to the solid results in the UK and the prospects for growth in the US, where Yell has been buying directories owned by the former Bell regional telephone companies. 'And there is a half-decent yield attached. We think it is attractive,' said Felton. Yell is promising a dividend equal to an annual yield of 3.3 per cent, twice what it proposed a year ago, reflecting the increased appetite for income among investors. The share issue, which is not being marketed to the public, is expected to raise around \u00a3850m. Half of the money will fund Yell's future growth, with the rest going to its venture capital owners, Apax Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, which will still hold more than 40 per cent of the shares. Directors are cashing in some of their stakes. Condron, for example, will sell shares worth \u00a35.5m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
