Sadiq Khan, who will launch its Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic manifesto with the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in Leicester, says the measures \u2013 which include quotas for senior civil servants and new legal requirements for police recruitment \u2013 will be the most far-reaching equalities programme for a generation. Khan said: \u201cWe want a sea change in people\u2019s attitudes and aspirations. People should be aiming for the top, whether it\u2019s in the boardroom, the civil service or the criminal justice system, irrespective of their background.\u201d Labour will introduce an overarching race equality strategy for the first time, run from the centre of government, to ensure that new policies across departments promote equality and improve the life chances of those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cIn past governments, what we have had is well intentioned ministers in department A not talking to department B \u2013 that is simply not good enough. For the first time, equality will be central to everything we do and driven forward across all departments in a coherent way\u201d, Khan said. Labour said the Liberal-Conservative coalition government had abandoned many of the measures designed to tackle discrimination and entrenched inequality, leading to a 50% rise in the number of young BAME people in long-term unemployment since 2010. Khan described the figure, which was revealed last month, as shameful and said a focus on allowing everyone to fulfil their potential would be at the heart of any future Labour government. He said: \u201cIf you\u2019re under 25 and black, you\u2019re twice as likely to be out of work as the national average. We simply cannot afford another five years of wasted talent under the Tories. It is a huge waste of the next generation\u2019s skills and potential and it comes at a huge cost to young black and minority ethnic people, their families, taxpayers and the economy.\u201d Khan said senior positions in the civil service, police, parliament and the judiciary were still dominated by white, middle-class men. \u201cOn the current fast stream civil service programme, almost everyone is Oxbridge educated and they are all white, so we will introduce a combination of diversity targets and quotas to address that \u2013 including for working-class candidates\u201d, he added. Labour would also take action at the top level of the judiciary, where only one of 108 high court judges are of a BAME background, and all 12 supreme court judges are white, with 11 of them men. Khan said: \u201cWe are going to take radical steps to address diversity within the judiciary, nothing is off the table, including quotas.\u201d Only 5% of police in England and Wales are BAME, compared to 14% of the general population, and Labour will introduce a legal responsibility on police forces to increase diversity and \u201creserve the right to change the law\u201d. The party will also change the way hate crime is dealt with in the face of rising anti-semitic and Islamophobic attacks, with the latter being specifically recorded by every police force for the first time. Khan declared that repeat offenders would face stiffer sentences and hate crimes would be clearly marked on criminal records. He said: \u201cAt the moment 14% of the country is BAME and this is all about fulfiling potential ... we all benefit by the potential of BAME Britons being fulfilled and everyone having the chance to play a full part in British life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
