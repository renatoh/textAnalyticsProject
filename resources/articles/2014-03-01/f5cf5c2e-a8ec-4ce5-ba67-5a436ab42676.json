The answer of the young American dramatist Jackie Sibblies Drury is to write a Pirandellian play about a theatrical collective grappling with exactly that theme. But the result, while witty and ingenious, tells us rather too much about the theatrical process and too little about the actual historic event. The full title of Drury's play is We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known As Southwest Africa, from the German Sudwest Afrika, Between the Years 1884-1915. The evening starts with a potted guide to the territory showing how the occupying German colonial power adopted a divide-and-rule policy towards rival tribes before ruthlessly exterminating 80% of the Herero between 1904 and 1907 by driving them into the desert. It's a shocking story but Sibblies focuses on how a company of six actors, equally balanced between black and white, get around to telling it. We see them improvising around letters home from German soldiers, struggling to represent indigenous Herero culture and eventually reproducing within their own group patterns of colonialist oppression. At times, the piece feels like a satire on group creativity with one self-preoccupied actor crying, \"I don't know what my active verb is.\" There is also something overly schematic about the way the actors playing the German colonial overlords get carried away by their own racist rhetoric. The most positive aspect of the 100-minute play is that it draws our attention to a horrific, but still little-known, act of genocide. Even though every word is scripted, Gbolahan Obisesan's admirably fluid production gives the impression of improvisation and makes excellent use of devices Katie Mitchell has recently deployed such as hand-held cameras and the visible production of sound-effects. From the cast of six, I'd invidiously pick out Ayesha Antoine as the exasperated group leader, Kingsley Ben-Adir as a mutinous figure who feels the Herero voice is being suppressed and Kirsty Oswald as an overly enthusiastic actor who wants to be everywhere and do everything. But, although the play opens up an important subject, I felt myself craving, as Shakespeare's Gertrude says to Polonius, more matter with less art."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
