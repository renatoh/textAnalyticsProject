But Nigeria performed with great resolve and no little skill. That run from Rasheedat Ajibade early in the second half was as exhilarating as football gets. Had Desire Oparanozie got a toe on Ajibade\u2019s cross to half the deficit, this would have been a whole lot tighter. Nigeria will also point to the questionable VAR call that allowed Germany\u2019s first goal to stand, with Svenja Huth standing in front of Chiamaka Nnadozie, offside, arguably interfering with play. But Germany had too much, even in second gear, as Alexandra Popp scored her 48th international goal while Lea Schuller bagged a clinical first at a World Cup. They advance to the quarters having played four, won four, scored nine, conceded none. Imagine what they might do if they start playing well! Germany maintain their record of reaching every World Cup quarter-final! They\u2019ll play Sweden or Canada next Saturday. Nigeria are on the way home. 90 min +4: Ogebe goes on a determined run down the inside right and nearly breaks through. But a consolation goal\u2019s not to be. 90 min +3: Huth dribbles at pace down the inside left. Ayinde hauls her down, but gets away with it. No free kick. 90 min +2: There will be five added minutes, incidentally. 90 min +1: No, but this wasn\u2019t half close. Oparanozie creams the free kick towards the top right. It\u2019s a pearler, but inches over the crossbar. That would have been a net-ripper had it been three or four inches lower. 90 min: Ordega sashays in from the left, and is unceremoniously upended by a sliding Oberdorf. A free kick just to the left of the box, 25 yards out. Can Nigeria find a consolation, and become the first team to score against Germany at this World Cup? 89 min: Huth makes a right-to-left diagonal run and nearly dribbles her way into a shooting position just inside the Nigerian box. But she ends up down a cul-de-sac. A fourth goal would be hard on Nigeria. 87 min: This game is fizzling out now. Germany have done the job required of them. But Nigeria didn\u2019t half make them work hard for it. 85 min: That was a stunning finish by Schuller. She hasn\u2019t done a great deal today, but when a chance presented itself she really delivered. Birgit Prinz or Gerd Muller would have been proud of that. 83 min: Kanu is replaced by Ogebe. It\u2019s all over. Ayinde dithers over the ball while facing her own goal under pressure. She attempts a backpass to the keeper, but can\u2019t get enough purchase on the panicked pass, and it sits up short for Schuller, who takes a stride down the inside-right channel before fizzing a clinical first-time shot into the bottom left. 81 min: Hegering suffers another whack, this time from Ajibade\u2019s elbow, planted into the back of her head as the pair contest a high ball. It was more clumsy than malicious, but Ajibade is going into the book nevertheless. 79 min: Some baroque dribbling by the fresh Oberdorf down the left. She cuts inside and rolls a gorgeous pass down the channel to release Dabritz into the box. Dabritz only has Nnadozie to beat, but she\u2019s coming in from a tight-ish angle, and drags her shot across the keeper and harmlessly out of play to the right of goal. That could have put this game to bed. As it is, Nigeria are still in this. But they need something soon. 77 min: A free kick for Nigeria just inside the German half. It\u2019s launched into the mixer. Okobi rises just inside the area, and gets a header on target, but she\u2019s too far out and there\u2019s not enough power in the effort. Schult gathers without drama. 75 min: Ihezuo departs to warm applause from the 17,988 inside the Stade des Alpes. Nearly a full house. Fingers crossed that\u2019s nothing more than cramp; she\u2019s put in quite a shift at both ends of the pitch this afternoon. She\u2019s replaced by Uchendu. 74 min: Ihezuo is down with a severe case of cramp. On comes the stretcher, it doesn\u2019t look as though she\u2019ll be able to continue. Team-mates perform the internationally understood mime to request a sub. 72 min: Gwinn has been a livewire presence for Germany. She very nearly fashions space to get a shot away from just inside the Nigeria box, but she\u2019s closed down at the last. Nigeria half clear. Then Simon fizzes down the left and cuts back for Popp, whose latest attempt at the spectacular nearly hits the left-hand corner flag from the best part of 35 yards. 70 min: Huth dribbles down the left and earns Germany\u2019s latest corner. Simon takes. She hits it long. Popp shapes for a volley, 12 yards out, and connects, but not cleanly. The ball squirts into a thicket of players before eventually being whacked clear. 69 min: Germany make their final change, switching Magull for Oberdorf. 67 min: Hegering is made of strong stuff and good to continue. 66 min: A free kick hoicked long into the German box. Oparanozie goes up with Hegering, and accidentally clashes heads with the defender. Ooyah oof. On comes the ice pack. That will have hurt. 64 min: Buhl earns a corner out on the right. Simon sends it straight down Nnadozie\u2019s throat. 62 min: More space for Simon on the left. Nnadozie punches this one clear with purpose. 61 min: Oparanozie is booked for coming straight through the back of Popp. Should Nigeria somehow turn this around, she\u2019ll not be playing it the quarter-final. 60 min: It\u2019s end-to-end fun. Kanu can\u2019t quite sort her feet out to shoot from the edge of the German box. Then Simon finds a lot of space down the left and crosses, the ball evading Nnadozie. But there\u2019s nobody in a white shirt available to turn the ball home. 58 min: Germany can\u2019t find much in the way of fluency, though this is better, as Buhl chases Popp\u2019s pass down the right and backheels for Gwinn, barrelling into space down the inside-left channel. Gwinn lifts her shot over the bar, in an attempt to float a chip over Nnadozie. A lovely move, shame about the finish. 57 min: Huth is booked for a clumsy charge into the back of Okeke. 56 min: Dabritz has a bash from distance. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, which results in Gwinn sending a dribbler towards goal from 25 yards. It\u2019s easily gathered by Nnadozie. 54 min: It\u2019s scrappy, but Nigeria will take that right now. They\u2019ve asked a fair few questions of Germany, whose passes aren\u2019t sticking. 52 min: Germany look a little shocked by that burst of brilliance. A flustered Hegering slices a simple clearance behind her and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but it\u2019s enough to get a concerned Martina Voss-Tecklenburg out of the dugout and into her technical area. 50 min: What a run by Ajibade! From the halfway line, she bursts down the left with great purpose and skill, gliding past Gwinn, who is left in the dust. Ajibade enters the box and fires a low ball across the face of goal. If Oparanozie connects with a telescopic leg at the far post, it\u2019s a goal, but the ball evades her toe by millimetres. What an entrance to the World Cup that was by Ajibade! 48 min: Germany come back at Nigeria, Buhl very nearly bustling her way into the box after getting on the end of a long clearance by Schult. She earns a corner. Hegering stops Nnadozie claiming on her line, and the whistle blows for a foul. Pressure off. 46 min: An early corner for Nigeria out on the right. It\u2019s sent sailing straight through the box and away from danger. But that\u2019s a statement of intent from the underdogs, who need something to happen quickly. And we\u2019re off again! Germany get the ball rolling for the second half, having made two changes. Schweers and Leupolz have been replaced by Simon and Buhl. Meanwhile Nigeria have swapped Nwabuoku for Ajibade, who makes her World Cup debut. Half-time entertainment. The design of Germany\u2019s shirt: a homage to this Atari Video Computer System classic? And that\u2019s the first half. Germany have reached the quarter-final stage of every World Cup to date, and they\u2019re 45 minutes plus however many extra hours will be added for VAR checks from making it again. 45 min +4: Or do they? Kanu is afforded more space down the right. She hoofs the ball towards Gwinn, who is facing the other way. The ball hits her upper arm. Nigeria want a penalty, and the referee checks, but it\u2019s not happening. The correct decision - Gwinn wasn\u2019t aware, she was right next to Kanu, and her arm was a totally natural position - but the crowd boo nevertheless. The neutrals have taken sides. 45 min +3: The ball\u2019s swung in from the right. Popp rises highest to flick a fine defensive header away from danger. And she\u2019s fouled in doing so. Germany weather the late storm. 45 min +2: A free kick for Nigeria on the halfway line. Ohale launches it long. Germany only half clear, and Ordega is able to cue up a cross from the right. She sends it in low, and Oparanozie tries to flick it home from the edge of the six-yard box. Doorsoun is forced to clip the ball out for a corner. 45 min: Dabritz sends it into the mixer. Oparanozie is forced to head behind. Dabritz takes again, Nnadozie dealing with the second one very well. There will be four extra minutes to play before the break, making up for all that VAR faff. 44 min: A quick throw releases Schuller into plenty of space down the right. She earns a corner. Nigeria simply can\u2019t afford to concede another before half-time. 42 min: Gwinn crosses hard from the right. Huth, ten yards out and level with the right-hand post, attempts to guide the ball into the net with a spectacular scorpion kick. Had that gone in, it would have surely been goal of the tournament. As it was, the ball sailed harmlessly wide. But full marks for ambition. 40 min: German passes aren\u2019t quite sticking right now. That\u2019s a testament to the way Nigeria have bounced back since conceding the second goal. They\u2019ve grown into the game again. 38 min: Okobi whips the ball towards the near post. It\u2019s whistling towards the top left, but Schuller is on the line to head clear. Another header, this time from Schweers, completely quashes the danger. Schult wasn\u2019t getting to that cheeky free kick, though. 37 min: Leupolz bundles into Ihezuo as the Nigerian forward works her way down the left. This is a free kick just to the side of the German box. Trouble ahoy for the two-time champs. 36 min: It\u2019s getting a bit tasty out there, as Popp becomes the latest player to go in the book for a cynical clip on Ordega, who was in the process of turning her and making off into space. 34 min: Now it\u2019s Gwinn\u2019s turn to be clattered, as Ihezuo jumps into her from behind in the midfield. A bit of payback, I\u2019ll be bound. The referee issues a one-last-chance lecture, but no booking. 32 min: Dabritz rolls a gorgeous pass down the inside-right channel, very nearly releasing Gwinn on the overlap. Ihezuo does extremely well to keep up and shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick. Gwinn, slightly exasperated, takes a wild swipe at the ball just before it runs out, and connects with Ihezuo instead. She\u2019s booked. 30 min: Short corner. Faff. Ball easily cleared. Did the first goal not teach Germany anything? 29 min: And Nigeria had started so well, too. The crowd have turned on the referee and Germany, and are booing at the non-award of every perceived foul. Germany care not, going about their business and winning another corner out on the right. Dabritz sends an unstoppable arrow into the bottom-right corner. Perfectly placed and executed! Nnadozie went the right way, but couldn\u2019t get anywhere near it, even at full stretch. 26 min: Nnadozie is lectured by the referee. Don\u2019t move off that line! There\u2019s hardly been any action for the last six minutes. It\u2019s all VAR-related shenanigans. The rhythm of the NFL. 25 min: Yep, it\u2019s a penalty, and Nwabuoku is booked. The crowd don\u2019t like this, and boo heartily, but this is the correct decision. 24 min: And now there\u2019s more VAR action, as Germany come straight back at Nigeria, Magull attempting to latch onto a ball in the Nigerian box. Nwabuoku swipes at the ball, but misses, kicking Magull\u2019s knee instead. This is probably going to be a penalty. So clumsy. 23 min: Probably, yes. But according to VAR, no. So the goal stands! 22 min: Of course, Fifa have their new toy, so this is going to VAR, with Huth possibly standing offside, marginally. Is she in front of Nnadozie, restricting the keeper? Here\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t play a short corner. Magull\u2019s presence wins a corner out on the left. The ball\u2019s whipped into a crowded six-yard box by Dabritz, who lands it perfectly on Popp\u2019s head. She doesn\u2019t have to move, instead flashing an instinctive header into the bottom right. Nnadozie had no chance! 19 min: One corner leads to another. Now it\u2019s Schweers and Magull\u2019s turn to pull off a clever short set piece. You know how this ends up. One of these routines will bear fruit soon, surely. 17 min: Popp has a pop from distance. Her shot is deflected high into the sky and briefly threatens to loop into the top right, over a stranded Nnadozie. But the ball flies away from harm. Corner. 16 min: Nnadozie takes her time over a goal kick in order to take a little sting out of the game. Plus it\u2019s hot. 14 min: Once again, Germany over-elaborate at a set-piece. Schweers and Dabritz make a holy mess of some routine or other. But the good news for Germany is their ability to think on the hoof when plans go awry. Not for the first time, they respond to making a mess of a free kick by recycling the ball well. Schweers is sent clear down the wing after some neat, crisp triangulation. Sadly the resulting cross is no good. 13 min: Magull is threatening to break into space down the left with a cute turn. She\u2019s unceremoniously upended by Okobi, and this is another dangerous free kick for Germany out on the touchline, the box loaded. 12 min: Schweers and Huth fiddle around with a short, intricate corner, to little effect. Schweers eventually loops a long, aimless ball over everyone in the box and out for a goal kick. 11 min: The corner is no good. Easily claimed by Schult. Germany go up the other end, Gwinn earning a corner down the right off Ohale. It\u2019s two-all in corners already. 10 min: Okobi bursts through a huge gap in the midfield and nearly releases Kanu into acres down the left. Doorsoun does extremely well to come across and nip the attack in the bud. But Nigeria are soon coming back at Germany again, Oparanozie dropping a shoulder to make gains down the left and earning a corner off Doorsoun. 8 min: Schuller busies herself down the German left to earn a corner. The set piece is hoicked into the mixer, and Nnadozie comes off her line, flapping wildly under the ball. She\u2019s lucky to get away with that one. Huth tries to recycle things out on the right, but can\u2019t keep the ball in play. It\u2019s been a really open and entertaining game so far. 6 min: Germany make an awful mess of a training-ground routine. But they recycle the ball, and Dabritz loops in from the left. The ball lands at the feet of Magull, who really should score from a central position, eight yards out. But she lets the ball get snagged between her feet, and by the time she gets a shot away, Ohale spreads to make a sensational block. Nigeria clear. 5 min: Ayinde concedes a clumsy foul, needlessly barging into Dabritz out on the German left. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Germany load the box. 3 min: Ordega, who has been involved in everything so far, makes good down the right and loops a cross into the German box. It\u2019s too close to Schult, who claims easily enough. But this is a very sprightly start by the underdogs. 2 min: The corner is whipped low towards the near post. Ordega, her back to goal, traps, turns and whistles a shot straight at Schult from a tight angle and at close range. The keeper gathers. And we\u2019re off! Nigeria get the party started. And within 45 seconds they win the first corner of the game down the right, after lovely work by Oparanozie, who sprays a pass wide to Ordega, who in turn feeds Ayinde. She bursts into the box and sees her cross knocked out. Here come the teams! The knockout stage of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup is upon us at last. This gets real, right here, right now. An anticipatory fever sweeps around the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. Jack White\u2019s most popular riff is hollered from every corner as two nation armies take to the stage. The atmosphere is boiling up nicely ... and the weather\u2019s pretty pleasant too, a balmy 30 degrees. Blasts of the Deutschlandlied and Arise, O Compatriots are performed and well-respected. Hands are clasped. Pennants are swapped. Coins are tossed. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! A word with Nigeria coach Thomas Dennerby. \u201cFirst we have to bring our good defence. But we also have to be a bit more patient in building up our attacks. If we find the right ways to attack, we will have the opportunity to steal some balls. They use their full-backs high, so there will be some spaces behind. We hope for that!\u201d Pre-match entertainment. Our Louise Taylor has been on the road in France, putting in the hard yards so you don\u2019t have to. Here\u2019s her weekly diary, which considers the impact the #MeToo movement has made on sunbathing habits in Nice, and hails the boundless energy of Phil \u2018New Guardiola\u2019 Neville. Germany wear their first-choice white shirts this afternoon. Alexandra Popp will be handing over this lovely pennant before kick-off. That none-more-modern DFB logo was designed in 1926. 1926! Nigeria will play in their second-choice dark green shirts. And by the looks of it they\u2019ll be properly hydrated. Just as well, as it\u2019s a sunny day in Grenoble. Alexandra Popp wins her 100th cap for the Nationalelf. The 28-year-old Wolfsburg striker has scored 47 goals for Germany since making her debut against North Korea in 2010. Lea Sch\u00fcller gets the nod to play alongside her. Meanwhile so much for building up the goal threat of Asisat Oshoala. She hasn\u2019t fully recovered from picking up a knock in Nigeria\u2019s final group game against France, and isn\u2019t fit to start. Uchenna Kanu makes her World Cup debut on the wing while Chinwendu Ihezuo and captain Desire Oparanozie lead the line. At the back, Evelyn Nwabuoku will make an African-record 14th appearance at a World Cup. Germany: Schult, Gwinn, Doorsoun, Hegering, Schweers, Huth, Leupolz, Magull, Dabritz, Popp, Schuller. Subs: Benkarth, Simon, Hendrich, Maier, Oberdorf, Goessling, Marozsan, Elsig, Dallmann, Buhl, Knaak, Frohms Nigeria: Nnadozie, Okeke, Ebi, Nwabuoku, Ohale, Ordega, Ayinde, Okobi, Kanu, Ihezuo, Oparanozie. Subs: Oluehi, Okoronkwo, Imo, Oshoala, Uchendu, Ajibade, Ogebe, Chukwudi, Ebere, Chikwelu, Michael, Jonathan. Referee: Yoshimi Yamashita (Japan). With most of the headlines so far being made by goal-hungry reigning champions USA, happy hosts France, upwardly mobile hopefuls England and the Netherlands, Aussie striker Sam Kerr, and that eejit in the VAR truck, Germany have arrived at the knockout stage almost unannounced. That\u2019s two-time world champions Germany. Eight-time European champions Germany. Current Olympic champions Germany. Three wins out of three in this year\u2019s groups without conceding a goal Germany. Yes, you remember them. The loss to injury of playmaker Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n, who broke her toe in Germany\u2019s opening match with China, goes a little way to explaining the slightly subdued expectations of the Nationalelf. But they\u2019ve come out of the group with a perfect record, having spread the goals around the team; there have been six of them, by five different scorers. They\u2019re currently on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Alexandra Popp, who manages on average a goal every other cap, could be making her 100th appearance today. Oh, and Marozs\u00e1n could get a run-out as sub, which would augur well for the rest of the tournament ... ... because the assumption is that Germany will progress. They\u2019ve met Nigeria twice before in World Cup competition, and won both matches, scoring five times and letting in nothing. Nigeria have played European opposition at the World Cup on a dozen occasions, losing nine and winning just the once, against Denmark in 1999. And while Germany sailed through the groups, Nigeria only squeaked through as the fourth-best third-placed team, a 2-0 win over a poor South Korea their only positive result. But in football, nothing\u2019s ever certain. And there\u2019s always hope. Nigeria might be the underdogs today, but they can boast Barcelona\u2019s Asisat Oshoala in their ranks. The former Liverpool and Arsenal striker came off the bench in this year\u2019s Champions League final to score Barca\u2019s consolation against Lyon, and has already contributed to this World Cup with a glorious finish against the Koreans, rounding the keeper and slotting home from a tight angle with poise and panache. As Thomas Dennerby, Nigeria\u2019s head coach, says: \u201cIf we score, they may get nervous and we will have a chance.\u201d So this promises to be a belter. It\u2019s the knockout stages of the World Cup! It\u2019s the Super Eagles and the Nationalelf! It\u2019s on! Kick off: 4.30pm BST, 5.30pm local at the Stade des Alpes, Grenoble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
