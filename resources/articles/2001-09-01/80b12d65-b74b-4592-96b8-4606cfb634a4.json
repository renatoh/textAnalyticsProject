A Musical Offering. In a pair of related pieces this year, he has now paid tribute to Bach's greatest contemporary. This... Second Musical Offering (GFH 2001), which was performed complete for the first time at Monday's Prom, is an exploration of Handel's forms, soundworld and procedures. Goehr's continued preoccupation with the musical past, which reached its apogee in his recomposition of Monteverdi's lost opera L'Arianna for Covent Garden in 1995, is a curious, disconcerting phenomenon. He likens his approach to the reworkings of classical paintings by artists such as Poussin and Picasso, but does not make this world his own in a convincing way. ... Second Musical Offering hovers in a curious no man's land between the 18th and 21st centuries. Sometimes it sounds like wrong-note Handel, just occasionally like neoclassical Stravinsky, while the pawky orchestration - with its strange doublings of woodwind and brass, baroque flourishes for harp and organ, and dislocated roulades for trumpets and drums - merely emphasises the discontinuities. The pungent, creative personality that was evident in Goehr's earlier works has been buried under layers of impersonal artifice. This overlong and cerebral exercise was the centrepiece of a strangely assorted programme from Leonard Slatkin and the BBC Symphony. The best came first - a tight, urgent account of Schoenberg's A Survivor from Warsaw, with Sanford Sylvan as the impassioned narrator, and the male voices of the BBC Symphony Chorus weighing in for the final defiant Hebrew chorus. It certainly said more in seven minutes than A Sea Symphony managed in 67. There are rousing things in Vaughan Williams's music, but far fewer in Whitman's clotted, tendentious verses, although Slatkin conducted the elephantine piece as if he believed in it. And the soloists - soprano Joan Rodgers and baritone Simon Keenlyside, both in fine form - did their best to deliver the text as if it were meaningful (what does \"I think a thought of the clef of the universe\" actually mean?), while the combined voices of the BBC Symphony and Philharmonia Choruses and the Trinity College Chamber Choir relished the opportunities for some full-throttle singing. This concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on September 19. Royal Albert Hall"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
