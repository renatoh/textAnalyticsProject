The wine-writing fraternity, who tend to be enthusiastic riesling advocates, argue that retailers, particularly supermarkets, should do more to promote its charms. Those in the trade, however, say it\u2019s not the supermarkets\u2019 job to shape consumer taste, merely to stock bottles for which there is a proven demand. So why don\u2019t more consumers want riesling? Well, it carries a lot of baggage: the long, unwieldy names; the fact that even the variety is easy to mispronounce (reece-ling, not ry-sling); the perception that it\u2019s generally German and sweet (neither of which is true). No wonder many people give up and drink sauvignon blanc instead. But according to the independent wine merchants I\u2019ve spoken to, it\u2019s more a question of giving customers the chance to try it. \u201cIt\u2019s rare, but not unheard of, for someone to come in and ask for it off their own bat\u201d says riesling enthusiast Mike Boyne of Bin Two in Padstow, Cornwall. \u201cBut having it on by the glass helps. Conversations often start with: \u2018Do you mind if I have a little taste of...\u2019 and end with: \u2018A glass of that, please.\u2019\u201d It certainly helps to kick off in the new world, especially Australia\u2019s Clare Valley, which makes lusciously limey rieslings that are easy to love. You also find deliciously fragrant rieslings from New York State and Washington State in the US and from New Zealand. Closer to home, Alsace and Austria produce drier, steelier styles than Germany, although even in Germany you can find a huge range, from the off-dry wines of the Mosel to the richer, more tropical styles of the Rheingau. Confusingly, a wine with \u201ckabinett\u201d on the label, generally taken to mean a dry wine, can be moderately sweet, especially if aligned to a low ABV; instead, look for the word \u201ctrocken\u201d and a higher alcohol content. Much is made of riesling\u2019s longevity, but I wonder how helpful that is, because only true enthusiasts get off on the slightly oily aromas and flavours that emanate from a mature bottle. For riesling virgins, fresh fruitiness is much more likely to appeal, so look for vintages from 2016-2018. There should be plenty of opportunity to experiment over the annual 31 Days of German Riesling promotion next month. I\u2019m sure the Germans would like you to drink nothing else, but frankly, any riesling is better than no riesling.
