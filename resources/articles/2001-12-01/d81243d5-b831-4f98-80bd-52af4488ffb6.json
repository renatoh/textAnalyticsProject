He was released without charge after the incident on Tuesday night, in which a photographer's equipment was allegedly damaged, and a statement issued by West Yorkshire police last night revealed it was unlikely the matter would be pursued. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale also absolved Fowler of culpability, claiming the recent \u00a311m recruit from Liverpool had been \"completely innocent\". However, the mere fact that Fowler spent the night in a police station will be of considerable irritation to Leeds as they wait for the jury to return in the trial of their other players Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate. It will also be of immense embarrassment to a player whose penchant for attracting detrimental headlines was one of the contributory factors behind Liverpool selling him to one of their main Premiership rivals. David O'Leary, the Leeds manager, had given his consent for a 30-strong party of players, complete with 10 security guards, to spend Monday night visiting pubs in Leeds, but only after calling them together beforehand to remind them that he did not want any more bad publicity. Fowler was among those who took part in the fancy-dress theme by going as a soldier in full army gear, complete with face paint and a toy gun. He and a friend were waiting in a taxi as the driver filled up with petrol when, it is alleged, they became embroiled in a confrontation with the cameraman. \"Two men, aged 25 and 26, were arrested in relation to an offence of criminal damage in Hunslet,\" said a police spokesman. \"They were arrested and released. There is unlikely to be a charge.\" Despite Ridsdale's public support, both he and O'Leary are understood to be furious about the nature of the incident and, in particular, the timing. \"I have spoken to Robbie and I am satisfied he was a completely innocent party to whatever happened. The club will be taking no further action,\" said Ridsdale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
