This involves feeling my forehead with the back of my hand while swallowing repeatedly to see if it hurts or not. They say the virus can cause symptoms so mild you might not even notice you have it. I think: I would notice. Two weeks ago I was looking in horror at TV footage of people streaming into Richmond Park, and thinking: I hope you can\u2019t see my car in that. Yes, I was there. But we didn\u2019t go to the park in order to join a mass infection gathering, and I don\u2019t think anyone else did, either. We went to Richmond Park because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s unfortunate that thousands of people had the same idea. Since then I have not ventured beyond my front gate. My wife leaves the house early every morning to walk the dog in some undisclosed location, but I don\u2019t go along. She still manages about 10,000 steps a day during the crisis. I do about 250, and that\u2019s only because I forget where I put things. It is a warm afternoon; not a bad day, all in all, for enforced sequestration. With the door of my office shed open, voices occasionally reach me from afar \u2013 from gardens, or from the street out front. It\u2019s partly due to the absence of other noise \u2013 no cars, no construction, no planes, no background school-playground shrieking \u2013 and partly, I think, because everybody is projecting their chat across a two-metre safety gap. I can\u2019t always make out the words, but I know what they\u2019re saying. If I overhear a conversation about something other than the lockdown, I know it\u2019s the Archers leaking from an open window. Every day, at about five, I walk across the garden to the kitchen, where my oldest son is invariably sitting at the table, fist on forehead, gazing into his phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say. We discuss the stupid thing that Donald Trump just said, and then I show him some viral videos that he has already seen. The youngest one walks in. \u201cDid you hear what Trump said?\u201d he says. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes,\u201d says the oldest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how he was all like \u2013\u201d \u201cWe heard it!\u201d says the oldest. \u201cYeah, we heard it,\u201d I say. \u201cAll right, yeesh,\u201d says the youngest. My wife walks in. \u201cWhat\u2019s for supper?\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re strangely spoilt for choice,\u201d I say, staring into the fridge. \u201cWe really need to start eating some of this stuff.\u201d I walk across the room to my case of wine. When I pull back the cardboard flaps, I see that there is only one bottle left. I pull it out and hold it up. \u201cOh dear,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could happen,\u201d I say. \u201cWe have, like, a six-month supply of pistachios, but we\u2019re out of wine?\u201d But I do know how it happened. My sons don\u2019t normally drink wine, but when the beer ran out, they adapted. When I realised what was going on, I tried to order some emergency wine, but the delivery got cancelled for safety reasons. I am reminded that these are hard times for those of us who enjoy complaining about not very much. \u201cThere\u2019s actually some beer in the car,\u201d my wife says. \u201cBut I was too embarrassed to carry it in. Wait until it gets dark.\u201d After supper, the four of us make a half-hearted effort to watch a film together, but we are not practised at agreeing on things. We flip around the channels and talk loudly over whatever we settle on. \u201cWe should all shave our heads,\u201d says the oldest. \u201cAs a protective measure, you mean?\u201d I say. \u201cJust to find out what we look like bald,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time we\u2019re allowed out, it will have grown back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d be up for it,\u201d says the youngest. \u201cI\u2019ve done it before,\u201d says the oldest. \u201cYou\u2019ve shaved your head?\u201d I say. \u201cNot my head,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve shaved a head.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s perhaps save that one for the weekend,\u201d my wife says, changing the channel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
