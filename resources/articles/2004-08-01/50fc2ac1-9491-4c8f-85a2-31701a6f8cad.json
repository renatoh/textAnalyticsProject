As Peter Mandelson prepares to take over his new brief as Europe's trade commissioner, the WTO is poised to confirm a preliminary ruling made in early August that the \u00a33-billion-a-year sugar regime breaks the rules of global trade. Europe's shoppers pay three times the global market price for their sugar, and quotas and tariffs prevent some of the world's poorest countries from selling their more cheaply produced sugar into the EU. Brazil, which brought the case against the EU, claims that Europe also dumps its excess sugar on world markets, depressing prices. Oxfam, which has conducted a long-running campaign against sugar subsidies, calculates that for every \u00a31 in aid Europe hands to poverty-stricken Mozambique, the African state is deprived of a further \u00a33 by losing out on access to the EU sugar market. Most of the winners, meanwhile, are large sugar-beet farmers in East Anglia and around Paris, and Europe's big corporate sugar processors. Brussels will be given the right to appeal against the ruling before the WTO allows the plaintiffs to impose sanctions, but trade campaigners are challenging Mandelson to kick off his tenure by persuading his fellow commissioners to accept defeat and begin cutting subsidies immediately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
