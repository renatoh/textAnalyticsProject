The Silicon Valley behemoth yesterday told customers that its AdSense platform would support video content so, for example, a beverages company could show a clip of somebody enjoying a tipple. Google said it was working with about a hundred YouTube participants including Expert Village, modelling agency Ford Models and lonelygirl15 to provide advertising content - although it stressed that clips would not play until users clicked on them. Since paying $1.65bn for YouTube last year, Google has been under pressure to show that it can produce profits from the video sharing site. Google's announcement came 24 hours after the company's shares passed a milestone by topping $600. During early trading on Nasdaq, they reached $616.14. Analysts predict a further growth spurt, partly on rumours that Google could introduce a telephone next year dubbed the \"Gphone\" to extend its advertising expertise into the mobile internet market. A Lehman Brothers analyst, Douglas Anmuth, set a share price target of $714. Writing in a research note, he said: \"Google phone could capture a similar share of handsets shipped as Apple's iPhone over a similar time period.\" Some reports have suggested that Google may release software to run mobile phones within the next month, with proprietary handsets to follow in February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
