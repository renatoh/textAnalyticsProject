The state has never been hospitable to plays or players. Even in Shakespeare's day, actors were classed with vagabonds and prostitutes and liable to persecution. But then \u2013 another paradox \u2013 during the reign of the first Elizabeth, the stage became the crucible of national artistry. By the time the First Folio was printed, this rapprochement between state and stage had broken down. Playwrights and actors had to find other ways to conjure their art. It was the Victorians who wanted a national theatre, an idea inspired by the French. When, in 1879, the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise performed at the Gaiety, patriotic pride was piqued. Why should we not have a national theatre, too? But there was no official appetite. The idea languished. Perhaps it would never have happened without the genius of Laurence Olivier. By the late 1940s, in the spirit of postwar renewal, the National Theatre Act established the idea. Olivier was appointed to embody it. He was joined by the Observer's Kenneth Tynan, the greatest critic of the age. Today, British life seems unthinkable without it. The National, the people's theatre, continues a fine tradition of licensed mischief: it entertains, occasionally sponsors outrage, and often inspires great performances, from Adrian Lester's Othello, to Maggie Smith's Hedda Gabler and Julia McKenzie's Adelaide in Guys and Dolls. Here you will see the best of Shakespeare, but also the works of Terence Rattigan, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, David Hare, Christopher Hampton and Lucy Prebble. Our actors are the envy of the world. Appropriately, the National plays its part, on the south bank of the Thames, opposite Westminster, the seat of power. Long may it flourish, the home of British self-expression. Happy birthday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
