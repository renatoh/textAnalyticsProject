In his remarks at a conference in London the prime minister warned: \"The danger is not a conscious decision to depart from New Labour, but an unconscious decision to cease driving it forward. It is that we go back to what makes us comfortable.\" Mr Blair's criticism was echoed by the party chairwoman, Hazel Blears, who issued a statement warning the party that it would lose the next election if it returned to a 1980s agenda. Ms Blears, a likely candidate for the deputy leadership herself, said: \"We should be leading the party, not indulging those elements which want to take us back to the 80s. \"You don't win elections from your comfort zone. You win them by showing courage and optimism.\" Mr Blair told the Policy Network thinktank's conference that Labour must balance the needs of the public and activists, to avoid the \"tyranny of the betrayal theory of progressive politics\". That theory, he said, holds that the public want more traditional leftist policies which the leaders of the left refuse to provide. He said: \"I've yet to work out how, if the public wants more traditional leftwing policies, they vote right.\" He told the conference: \"This is not about tolerating one part of the coalition and embracing the other. \"It's not about merely accepting the aspirant class, tolerating the element that might vote conservative but we want to vote progressive; it's not about being gracious enough to allow their concerns on tax or immigration or responsive public services to intrude on our core cause. \"It's about a wholehearted embrace of them. It's not enough to be 'not against them'. We need to be for them, welcoming them, letting them shape and influence our policy. It means never relapsing into appealing to our heart detached from our head.\" Mr Blair also insisted that his successor would have to embrace the law and order agenda as he had. He said: \"The reason we have to be the ones taking on the challenge of terrorism, security, and the linked concerns over crime and immigration is because the people see the challenge clearly and want us to respond. If we fail to, if it's all too difficult, don't be surprised if they turn instead to the right.\" He again refused to endorse Gordon Brown, but said he was in \"no doubt\" that \"those who will take on the mantle of leading the party into the next election do indeed want New Labour to remain New Labour. \"This means, difficult though it is: being for hard as well as soft power in international policy, patient power as well as investment in the NHS; tough measures on crime as well as against poverty; celebrating success, merit, excellence as well as caring for those left behind.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
