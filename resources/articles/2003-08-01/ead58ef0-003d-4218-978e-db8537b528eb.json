He began the day with a 10-point lead, had stretched it to 15 after six holes and won eventually by 12 from Retief Goosen. He had led throughout the tournament for the first time in his 18-year career, during which time he had won 17 titles on the US tour. While being interviewed afterwards on the 18th green, Love broke down. Describing rumours that he was about to divorce his wife as \"totally unfounded\" he added, in a voice full of emotion: \"Robin, I love you. Things are going to get better. I dedicate this tournament win to you.\" Love has had other problems in his life recently too. On May 16 his brother-in-law, who was part of his management team, shot himself after he was involved in investigations into financial irregularities. Love himself found the body. But he seemed to have recovered from that trauma, and the rumours to which he referred had been confined to the locker room. By acting as he did, however, he has ensured they will get an airing. Love won $900,000 (\u00a3560,000) to take his 2003 winnings to $5,122,038 and he passes Tiger Woods at the top of the money list. He also passes the $25m mark on the career money list. Ahead of him Paul Casey, joint 27th after three rounds, was playing his best golf of the week. By birdying both the long holes going out and hitting it close at the 2nd and 9th, he moved from 14 points overnight to 21. He birdied the long 14th as well and when a 40-footer dropped at the short 16th he went to 24 points and joint sixth. Then, with the 17th a long hole of only 492 yards, he had hopes of at least 26 points and a huge cheque. But a poor drive denied him a birdie and when he hit his second past the pin at the 18th he left himself with a 15-foot putt down the slippiest of slopes. It was an expensive finish. Had he gone birdie, par he would have had 27 points and a probable top five, worth $200,000. With 23 points he finished in a three-way tie for 10th and had to make do with $125,000. Not that the Englishman was worried. \"You make your money in this game by winning,\" he said. \"If you worry about the odd 10 or 20 grand you're in the wrong business.\" Jose Maria Olazabal rescued what was looking like a poor round with four birdies on his back nine for a 16-point total."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
