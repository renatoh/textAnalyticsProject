Not even Paul McCartney charges that sort of money, and it's true she is asking for more than the Rolling Stones and Madonna put together. But you've got something special with Streisand. It's that living-legend syndrome, where you're almost paying to be in the same room - like the Stones, whom I saw at Wembley, or Dylan, whom I saw in his pissed rockabilly phase. When something as rare as this July's Streisand concert comes along - it's 13 years since she last played here - you can probably make a case for charging \u00a3500. She hasn't even done the Vegas thing, where you earn millions by doing a year-long residency. She isn't renowned for her songwriting credibility, but she can achieve such a variety of musical moods and has a real gift for picking the right tunes. It's possible that her diva demands may have pushed up the cost, since she apparently asked for 120 bath towels and five living-room suites during her American tour. But she's also said that some of the proceeds are going to charity. I've never seen Streisand live, but you could say we go back a long way. Her song Guilty is one of the inspirations behind the Guilty Pleasures phenomenon. When it first appeared in 1980, I was in complete awe of its genius, even if I had to keep my feelings secret from my friends. When she and Barry Gibb did their follow-up, they wanted to call it Guilty Pleasures. But I had already taken a copyright out and Streisand had to change it to Guilty Too. I loved the thought that at some point someone had to explain that to the ultimate diva. \u00b7 Sean Rowley is the DJ behind the Guilty Pleasures club night and compilation series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
