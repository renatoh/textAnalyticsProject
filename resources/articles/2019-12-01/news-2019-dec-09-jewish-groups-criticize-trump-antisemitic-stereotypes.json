Trump told the audience at the event in Florida on Saturday they had \u201cno choice\u201d but to vote for him. \u201cYou have to vote for me, you have no choice. You\u2019re not going to vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that,\u201d Trump said, using his derogatory nickname for Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the frontrunners for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t like me \u2026 you\u2019re going to be my biggest supporters because you\u2019re going to be out of business in about 15 minutes if [the Democrats] get it.\u201d He also told the audience, to some laughter and cheers: \u201cA lot of you are in the real estate business because I know you very well. You\u2019re brutal killers, not nice people at all.\u201d While boasting about pro-Israel policies like moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Golan Heights, Trump also said some Jewish people in America \u201cdon\u2019t love Israel enough\u201d. Multiple Jewish organizations released statements criticizing Trump for reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes that Jews are solely motivated by money and owe or demonstrate loyalty to Israel. Halie Soifer, executive director of Jewish Democratic Council of America, said in a statement the remarks were an \u201cunconscionable repeating of negative stereotypes that have been used historically to target Jews\u201d. Soifer reiterated the council\u2019s stance that Trump is \u201cthe biggest threat to American Jews\u201d because of his rhetoric that has \u201cemboldened the rise of white nationalism in America, which has directly led to increased hatred and violence targeting Jews\u201d. The American Jewish Committee said it appreciated the president\u2019s support for Israel, \u201cbut surely there must be a better way to appeal to American Jewish voters \u2026 than by [using] money references that feed age-old and ugly stereotypes.\u201d Trump has questioned the loyalty of Jewish Americans before. In August, he said any Jews who vote Democratic are \u201cdisloyal to Jewish people \u2026 and very disloyal to Israel\u201d. He also said Jewish Democrats show \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d. Speaking to American Jews at a White House Hanukkah party last year, the president referred to Israel as \u201cyour country\u201d. Speaking to Jewish Republicans last spring, Trump referred to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \u201cyour prime minister\u201d. According to an August 2019 Gallup report, a majority of Jewish Americans, nearly 70%, identify as or lean Democrat versus 23% who identify as or lean Republican. In the 2016 election, 71% of Jewish voters supported Hillary Clinton while 23% supported Trump. According to a May 2019 poll from the Pew Research Center, while many American Jews are favorable toward policies supporting Israel, 42% believe Trump favors Israel too much. In comparison, according to a May 2019 poll from Pew, 26% of American Christians say he favors Israel too much while 59% say he is striking the right balance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
