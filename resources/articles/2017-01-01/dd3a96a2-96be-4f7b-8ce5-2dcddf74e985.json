Coutinho will return to the Liverpool squad for the EFL Cup semi-final first leg at St Mary\u2019s Stadium on Wednesday having missed almost seven weeks with ankle ligament damage. The 24-year-old has trained only four times with the first team and will not be 100% fit for Sunday\u2019s trip to Old Trafford in the Premier League. But Klopp, who has lost Sadio Man\u00e9 to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, says Liverpool need Coutinho match-fit as quickly as possible and that even a fleeting return could shape two matches of major significance to the club\u2019s season. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cThe time is not long enough for him to be 100% for Manchester United but he could play. We have spoken before about there being a difference between being fit and being match-fit but of course it\u2019s Phil, so we want to try everything we can to bring him as close as possible to his 100%. \u201cIn this moment I would say it makes sense for him to be involved against Southampton, in the squad, and we will see what happens there \u2013 whether we have to use him or not or whatever. If not, we have another three days to prepare him for United. A few minutes for him does make sense. We will see if he\u2019s ready tomorrow and on Wednesday morning. Then we will make the decision.\u201d Coutinho has scored six goals this season and was instrumental in Liverpool\u2019s rise to Premier League contention before suffering injury against Sunderland on 26 November. His time on the sidelines has quelled suggestions Barcelona are keen on the Brazil international but Klopp insists that would never have been an issue for Liverpool this month, fit or otherwise. \u201cIt would be nice if big clubs thought like this and forgot about a player completely because he\u2019s been injured for five or six weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s like this but we never had any ideas or any plans or any talks about this because he is our player. \u201cThere are no other ideas. Nothing changed. Big clubs don\u2019t think this way, unfortunately. It was not a big injury so there was no question of him not being the same player afterwards.\u201d Klopp is likely to continue with Loris Karius in goal at Southampton in keeping with his policy of rotating goalkeepers for cup games, and has insisted Roberto Firmino\u2019s off-field problems have not distracted the Brazilian. Merseyside police have confirmed the Brazil international\u2019s home was burgled on 22 December, days before he was charged with drink-driving. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWhat can I say? It\u2019s been difficult. But he has dealt really well with it on the pitch. That is how Roberto is. When he is on the pitch he thinks about nothing else other than football. It is a big strength of him, I would say. But it has not been nice.\u201d James Milner is expected to return from a calf injury at Southampton. Jordan Henderson will be absent with a heel problem but Klopp hopes the captain will feature at Old Trafford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
