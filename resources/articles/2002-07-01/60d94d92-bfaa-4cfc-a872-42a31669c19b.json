Millar fought his way through a crash successfully on his debut in 2000, lost a similar battle last year, and now will begin the fight again after three chutes in two days. Two of those, close to the stage finishes yesterday and on Thursday, were relatively innocuous, a matter of braking to a halt, falling gently, and then tiptoeing through the bodies lying prone on the Tarmac. That is annoying rather than positively harmful. Yesterday's first crash, however, some eight miles into the stage, is a different matter, as it has left a big, painful lump on his lower right leg where the thigh tendons run into the calf. \"We weren't going fast, some idiots just got caught up in each other,\" he explained. \"I thought we were out of it, then the other guys came flying into the back of us. I got knocked over and just went sliding along. The second one was just the same as yesterday, nothing much. That's the Tour.\" The marks are nowhere near as spectacular as the hangman's gash on his neck left by a tyre late in the 2000 race, but it remains to be seen how the injury affects his progress. Ironically, until yesterday, the 25-year-old Scot was talking blithely about how stress-free he was finding this year's race, somewhere in between the euphoria of his first Tour in 2000, when he wore the yellow jersey, and last year's \"horrific, unbearable\" struggle. On Monday, his knee permitting, Millar will finally start to put a little pressure on himself. In the 31-mile time-trial on Brittany's south-west coast, he will make a wholehearted attempt to win back the white jersey worn by the Tour's leading young rider. He wore the jersey for much of the 2000 race, and briefly after his fifth place in last Saturday's prologue time-trial. \"I want to get it, and I want to keep it, although that will be hard.\" The Russian Denis Menchov, a fine climber, and the Italian Ivan Basso, a strong all-rounder, will be his principal rivals, he believes. Millar's plan was to come to the Tour slightly below his best, so that he will exit the race in top form for the Vuelta a Espana in September. At his Cofidis team, all the responsibility lies at present with the young Kazakh Andrei Kivilev, who was a surprise fourth overall last year, and carries the team's hopes for a high overall placing. In essence, the Scot is free to ride his own race, although that may change if Kivilev falters. Millar has been able to watch the action in the first week from a relatively dispassionate viewpoint. The universal assumption that Lance Armstrong is unbeatable has, Millar believes, made the opening stages of this year's race far less tense than is usually the case. \"I don't think anyone believes they're going to achieve anything by trying to catch Lance out at this point in the race, by trying to break the race up in the wind, for example.\" To prove he can be a man of the Tour, Millar needs a respectable race: a stage win, the white jersey, or a place in the top 25. On Thursday the race finally enters the Pyrenees, after an unusually long run-in to the mountains, and it will be that the first mountain, the Col d'Aubisque, that will determine how Millar deals with the rest of the race. His aim before the Tour was to be the first Briton to win a stage since Max Sciandri in 1995: a road-race stage, that is, as opposed to the short time-trial prologue which was Chris Boardman's speciality, and which he himself won in 2000. When the race arrives at the foot of the Aubisque, his gameplan is to \"hang on until I explode\". And avoid accidents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
