Victorians suffering immense pain and terminal illnesses will now be able to request access to the scheme after laws came into force on Wednesday. Victoria\u2019s parliament passed the legislation in November 2017, after a conscience vote and a marathon parliamentary debate lasting about 100 hours. The state is the first in Australia to introduce voluntary assisted dying. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the government was expecting about a dozen people to take up the offer in the first year with predictions this will increase to 150 annually in later years. \u201cWe think we have struck the appropriate balance here to give people access to compassionate end of life care,\u201d she told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. What happens now? People with incurable, advanced and progressive diseases, who are expected to die within six months, must have two doctors assess their conditions. Under the law, only the person wanting to access voluntary assisted dying can initiate discussions with health workers. Medical practitioners must complete special training before being able to conduct eligibility assessments. So far, 122 doctors have undertaken the course and one-third are located in regional Victoria. There is a 10-day wait between a request for voluntary assisted dying until a permit can granted. A pharmacy team at the Alfred Hospital Melbourne will be responsible for dispensing the lethal medication and delivering it in a locked box to people\u2019s homes for it to be self-administered. Patients will have to drink 100ml of liquid within four minutes. What are the conditions? There are 68 strict conditions in place before someone can access the scheme including: \u2022 Patients must be an adult aged over 18. \u2022 They must be an Australian citizen or permanent resident and have lived in Victoria for at least a year. This measure is in place to avoid \u201ceuthanasia tourism\u201d. \u2022 Patients must be of sound mind. \u2022 They must make three clear requests. \u2022 An independent review board will oversee every stage of the process and the state coroner must be notified of assisted dying deaths. Who is affected? For Melbourne resident Ryan Sheales, the laws have come too late for his beloved older sister, Kate. But he is grateful others will have greater choice and potentially will not have to endure the same prolonged suffering. His sister was diagnosed with osteosarcoma \u2013 the most common type of bone cancer. \u201cShe is my big sister but at 36 I\u2019m now older than she ever was,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my sister was alive today, she would be applauding these new laws and thanking those who have campaigned so tirelessly to see them realised.\u201d Before her death, family and friends raised money for her medical treatment and to send Kate and her husband on holiday. \u201cWe gave my sister distractions, adventures and comforts because that was all we could give her,\u201d Sheales said. \u201cWhat she wanted originally, a healthy life, the cancer robbed from her. And what she wanted at the very end, a good death, the state denied to her.\u201d Ongoing resistance On the eve of the law coming into effect, four Victorian Catholic bishops issued a last-ditch warning against the measure. \u201cWe cannot cooperate with the facilitation of suicide, even when it seems motivated by empathy or kindness,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThese words will sound hard to hear but, as pastors of the Catholic dioceses of Melbourne, Ballarat, Sale and Sandhurst, we feel a responsibility not just to say no to voluntary assisted dying, but to give every encouragement to model a way of life that renders voluntary assisted dying unnecessary.\u201d Catholic health and aged care organisations have flagged they won\u2019t provide or facilitate voluntary euthanasia. \u201cWhile we will not be providing voluntary assisted dying, we know our facilities are operating in an environment where patients or residents may wish to explore this option,\u201d the Catholic Health Australia chief executive, Suzanne Greenwood, said. \u201cIf people in our care wish to access voluntary assisted dying from other providers, our services will not impede them. We will provide release from care as well as transfer if they wish to access services elsewhere.\u201d Other jurisdictions The Western Australian Labor government has announced plans for similar laws, while an inquiry is underway in Queensland. Meanwhile, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory are fighting to regain the power to legislate on the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
