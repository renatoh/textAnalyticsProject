Only a great man can write it,\" said Oscar Wilde. But on October 17, the whole country is being challenged to make history by writing a diary of their day. The One Day in History project is inviting everyone to record a blog, so creating a massive historical record to be held by the British Library, depicting one day in the life of our nation. This monumental undertaking is part of the History Matters - Pass It On campaign, supported by the National Trust and major heritage organisations (www.historymatters.org.uk). The project aims to raise awareness of history in our everyday lives. Adults and young people alike are being invited to participate. It's a wonderful opportunity to ensure that your school not only has its place in history, but also makes its mark on the future. An ordinary day, like no other October 17 has been chosen for no other reason than it is an ordinary day - but diaries needn't be uploaded on that day. Contributions can be drafted and proofread before being sent to the site. Ideally each blog should reflect how history has affected the writer's life, and schools can focus on this throughout the day. The school librarian can help to raise the profile of the day by organising book and information displays for subject areas - important discoveries in science, sports persons' biographies, local history, and so on. They can also exploit the popularity of the Horrible Histories type series, by holding lunchtime readings or quizzes in the library. Use lesson starters to raise the profile of history. Launch lessons with a history-related quotation, eg \"One faces the future with one's past\", and allow two minutes to explore the meaning before highlighting the importance of history to the lesson. An internet search throws up masses of quotations, or simply scroll through random quotations at www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/quotations/random_history_quotes.html. Urge students to create their own thoughtful phrase or sentence about the impact of history on their lesson. For homework students can use favourite quotations to create a poster celebrating the history of the subject being studied. Examples of history posters can be found on the Learning Curves site (www.learningcurve.gov.uk). Nearly 1,000 years ago, the Domesday Book gave us our first great snapshot of the nation's life. The Learning Curves site has an excellent section devoted to Domesday (www.learningcurve.gov.uk/focuson/domesday). Give students time to investigate the information, as well as what is not covered (information on children, homes, thoughts, etc). Encourage them to create a fuller picture in their blog. Students can begin to explore their own place in national history by interrogating the BBC's interactive timeline (www.bbc.co.uk/history/interactive/timelines/british). Challenge them to find three key moments on the timeline that have had an impact on their lives now, such as the introduction of compulsory education. Exploring personal diaries will help students relate to history as well as stimulating their own writing. Students might enjoy Samuel Pepys' dramatic descriptions of the Great Fire of London (www.pepys.info). Finally, encourage students to consider their own personal history. With due sensitivity to their backgrounds, ask them to record something about their history. The BBC Family History website is a good starting place (www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory). Older students may wish to embark on researching their own family. Younger students may try to discover the roots of their names. Alternatively, ask students to record a video or audio diary of October 17 in the style of the Video Nation videos (www.bbc.co.uk/videonation), to support the writing of their blog. Ensure that students keep a copy of their diary. Show them the beautifully illustrated medieval Book of Hours on the British Library site (www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/medieval/golfbook/imagegallery/golf.html) and ask them to add one or two illustrations to their day. The finished work can be displayed or bound as a school publication.
