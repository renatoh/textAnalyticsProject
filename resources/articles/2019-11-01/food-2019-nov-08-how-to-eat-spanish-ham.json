But not, you imagine, any jam\u00f3n. The very thought of it probably brings S\u00e1nchez out in a cold sweat after he recently stood up at a livestock fair in Extremadura and confused jam\u00f3n serrano with jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. In a country where cured ham is considered as necessary to sustaining life as air and water, this in an epic everyman fail up there with Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201clove\u201d of the Arctic Monkeys or George Osborne\u2019s dismissive attitude to Greggs. What is S\u00e1nchez? British? In fairness to poor old Pedro, air-dried ham is confusing, no matter how short you try to keep the explanation. Cheaper, more commonplace serrano ham is made from various white pig breeds, such as Duroc, and classified by how long it has been aged, from between six and 18 months. In contrast, the revered, expensive jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico is created from Iberian pata negra or black foot pigs and rated on the purity of the pig\u2019s breed, its feed and ageing lengths of up to five years and more. The very best, largely acorn-fed ham is jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico de bellota, with black-label hams from genetically pure black Iberian pigs besting the crossbred red-label output. Given the more than 2,000 years of history and manufacturing craft that lie behind the creation of even the most humble ham, not to mention the skill that goes into serving it (carvers serve an apprenticeship that can last five years), the least we can do is eat it with due consideration. Which is where How to Eat \u2013 the series exploring how best to enjoy our favourite foods \u2013 comes in. It\u2019s the inspiration for one of the worst football kits of all time and \u201carguably the greatest item of food in the world\u201d (as the writer Simon Majumdar once put it on this website). It is time to get productively pig-headed about Spanish ham. Cooking ham? If you must cook ham, the one to use is everyday serrano as per chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro\u2019s recipes. There is an argument that all but the cheapest, industrially produced jam\u00f3n is best savoured on its own, but certainly cooking with ib\u00e9rico is like carting a sofa to the tip in a new Bentley; watching Still Open All Hours in an Imax; or wrapping a wet dog in a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons coat. It is a shocking waste of an amazing product, and one that will cost you a fortune. At the London delicatessen Brindisa, 100g of pre-sliced, top-end ib\u00e9rico will set you back \u00a326.75, whereas the serrano starts at \u00a33.95. That explains why, while there are just four recipes on the exhaustive BBC Good Food website that incorporate ib\u00e9rico in cooked dishes, serrano is common in croquetas, crisply fried in salads or garnishing soups such as salmorejo, and with scrambled or fried huevos at breakfast. Serrano\u2019s savoury heft brings a new seriousness to any frivolously light\u2019n\u2019creamy egg dish. A short note on sandwiches Unless you are James Bond\u2019s old nemesis Jaws, it is impossible to cleanly bite through any sandwich containing serrano or its cured European cousins such as prosciutto or Bayonne ham. They are simply too fatty. You are left tearing and pulling at your sandwich like a dog wrestling a bone off its owner. It is also a fallacy that even the sweatiest, melting jam\u00f3n is self-lubricating in a sandwich. Spanish food excels in many areas, but the prevalence of dry jam\u00f3n bocadillos, untouched by even a splash of olive oil or tomato pulp, is baffling. Live a little, Spain: slap a bit of butter on! Serving: two\u2019s company, three\u2019s a crowd This is not a ploughman\u2019s. Any half-decent jam\u00f3n is is best left to shine alone in the spotlight: silky, sweet, earthy, boldly savoury and lightly acidic. Particularly if you are eating good ib\u00e9rico, its intramuscular fat lush with acorn-derived monounsaturated oleic acid, it can stand alone. It is its own satisfyingly complex, self-contained world. It does not need partnering with crusty bread, cornichons, tomatoes, manchego or random cheeses, other continental meats, chutneys and remoulade, or any of those other items that nervous British restaurant kitchens feel they need to present it with in order to confidently charge a premium for such a product. Such over-elaboration actively detracts from the jam\u00f3n, muffling its flavours with a variety of lesser ingredients. In Spain, you might spot jam\u00f3n served with a bread sticks or bread and oil but these play a similar role to that of Andrew Ridgeley in Wham! \u2013 mere handsome window dressing alongside the real talent and, cf George Michael\u2019s solo career, entirely dispensable. Temperature control Experts advise that jam\u00f3n should be served at 20C to 24C. Easily achieved in Seville, less so in Swansea or Salford. At HTE Towers, for instance, the thermostat is only turned up past 19C in times of medical emergency. Given that, some suggest consumers should run packets of sliced ham under hot water before opening them or even hold individual slivers of ham in their loosely gripped hands until the meat warms. Only then should you wolf it down. Was this the subliminal meaning inherent in Lady Gaga\u2019s VMAs meat dress? It is indisputably true that eating fridge-cold ham is a huge waste: its flavours are dull and muted where at warmer temperatures their nuances sparkle and shine. Ideally, you want your jam\u00f3n to be as clammy as a tube commuter in a July rush-hour, its fats beginning to bead and run so that, when thinly sliced, the jam\u00f3n almost melts on your tongue, flooding your mouth with flavour as you gently suck it into submission. As an aside, this is why jam\u00f3n only works as an extra topping with pan con tomate if, as is rarely the case, the pan is still warm and the tomate pulp is room temperature rather than, again, freshly blitzed from the fridge. Equipment Given the tendency of warm jam\u00f3n to stick to porcelain and cold plates to deleteriously chill your ham, a wooden board or neat square of pristine white greaseproof paper is preferable, practically and aesthetically. Talking of which, you may come across intimidating pictures of wafer-thin lonchas (expertly carved shards of jam\u00f3n, ideally one or two bites in size) arranged in highly precise concentric or geometric patterns, alternating diagonally like tiny ruby red paving stones and sometimes decorated with a jam\u00f3n rose. Like latte art, such decoration is lovely and entirely pointless \u2013 a fleeting, unnecessary moment of amusement (unlike the practical \u201cmeat volcano\u201d, where a ceramic heating cone keeps the jam\u00f3n toasty). As long your lonchas are laid out flat without overlapping one another too much, so sticking together, all is good. For that same reason, avoid the tendency to serve longer strips of ham artfully folded and coiled alongside and around one another on a plate, like a rolling surf of pork products. It may look attractive, but long pieces of meat can leave you pulling at them in an awkward manner or stuffing too much in your mouth to avoid the wrangling \u2013 and, if sharing a platter, you may find yourself fighting over intertwined pieces of jam\u00f3n. HTE has seen jam\u00f3n served like it is having a game of Twister, which, like Twister itself, is no fun at all. There is, of course, no need for cutlery here. Use your fingers. Anyone who visits Spain and sits there prissily pulling the fat off jam\u00f3n (the best bit!) with a knife and fork deserves to be deported. When Dinner and tea in its natural, unadorned form; serrano with eggs for breakfast. So basically all the time, if you like: 24/7 pork action. Indeed, that utility can be an issue, leading fans \u2013 and HTE has been guilty of this \u2013 to binge on lower-quality ham until they hit the wall (or the end of a fortnight\u2019s holiday in Spain, as it is also known). Familiarity breeds, if not contempt, then boredom, as you begin to wonder what all the fuss is about. Like any of the world\u2019s great foods, jam\u00f3n is best enjoyed at dignified intervals, preferably newly carved from a whole leg of something good by someone who knows what they are doing. Keep it as a treat. As, for different, ecological reasons, we should all meat. Drink When talking about jam\u00f3n, it is impossible to ignore its association with sherry, and specifically bone-dry, tangy fino and its saline-subset, manzanilla. Which is a bit of a problem for those of us, HTE included, who find sherry just a bit too, well, sherry-ish. That is clearly not a small group, given that every year for the past decade has been hailed as \u201csherry\u2019s year\u201d, without it genuinely crossing over. The unconvinced have options, though: clean and zippy, crisply fruity brut cavas and \u2013 in the same ball park, flavour-wise \u2013 dry, tart saisons, drier ciders and even certain lighter, sharper wheat beers would all work well, periodically livening the palate without clashing with the lingering flavours of all that rich, buttery jam\u00f3n.
