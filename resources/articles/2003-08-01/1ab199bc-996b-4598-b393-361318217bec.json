His enthusiasm was shared by Rangers chairman John McClelland, who admitted he was \"very excited\" after his side had been drawn in a group containing Stuttgart, Panathiniakos and the English champions. \"It will be a great contest,\" he added. \"Yesterday we didn't know whether we would be in the Champions League, today we are and we've got Manchester United.\" However United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, while looking forward to the clash against Rangers, sounded a note of caution about his side's other opponents. \"It's a great draw,\" he said on the club's official website, www.manutd.com. \"I was half expecting to get a Scottish team, but also not expecting it to happen. But it has. On the subject of Panathiniakos he added: \"We've been there before, and were lucky in March 2001 when we got a 1-1 draw and could have been slaughtered. It will be a difficult tie and a difficult atmosphere.\" Meanwhile Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein was in bullish mood despite being drawn against Internazionale - and being handed lengthy trips to Locomotiv Moscow and Dynamo Kiev. \"It's great for the air miles!\" Dein joked, before adding: \"I like to think that whenever you play in Europe it's a big test but I think we've got a strong squad and let's hope we can go further than we have before.\" \"Our domestic form hasn't been too bad and the club is now seeded fifth in the whole of Europe so that means since Arsene Wenger arrived we've done exceptionally well.\" And the general wave of optimism even permeated down to Celtic chairman Brian Quinn, whose side face a tough group containing against Bayern Munich, Olympique Lyon and Anderlecht. \"It's tough, but that's what we expected,\" he insisted. \"Bayern Munich are obviously the leading team, but I think all the teams are evenly matched. \"Last year we proved we are capable of competing against sides like Liverpool and Stuttgart and so we can take encouragement from that.\" Quinn was also pleased that both Rangers and Celtic had made it through to the group stage of the tournament. He added: \"I am delighted Rangers are in the draw. When we were making progress through the Uefa Cup we got lots of messages from Scottish teams, including Rangers. \"There was a real national feel and we hope that will carry on. They have got a tough draw, but I am pleased for them. \"Our rivalry doesn't end after we play each other. We are always looking for each other's results all the time and this adds to the spice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
