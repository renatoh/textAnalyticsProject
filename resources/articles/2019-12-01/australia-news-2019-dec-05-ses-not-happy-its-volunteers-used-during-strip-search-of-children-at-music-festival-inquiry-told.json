On Thursday the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission heard that three SES volunteers were ordered to leave the festival only an hour after they arrived due to \u201cconcerns\u201d raised by senior officials. \u201cI have my suspicions it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d an SES team leader told the commission. The LECC is conducting ongoing hearings into the potentially illegal strip-search of minors at the Lost City music festival, an under-18s event held in Sydney in February. The inquiry is investigating the strip-searches of three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 at the festival, none of which found any illegal drugs, as well as the \u201cgeneral question\u201d of how police exercise their strip-search powers in NSW. It previously heard police had arranged for two SES volunteers to act as independent support people during searches at that festival, a requirement when strip-searching a minor in NSW, but that a senior police officer said it wasn\u2019t a \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d if they had not completed working with children checks. On Thursday a unit commander with the SES said that while the two volunteers did hold the qualification, police waited until seven months after the festival in September to check. The decision to use SES volunteers has been the subject of criticism from the LECC\u2019s commissioner, Michael Adams QC, who has questioned what qualifications SES members had to represent the rights of minors during a strip-search.

An SES unit commander told the LECC that when he was contacted by police in the lead up to an under-18s music festival in February he was asked to provide volunteers to act as support people for children during interviews, but not strip-searches. The inquiry heard that even after the volunteers were told they might be asked to be present during a search, a volunteer said police did not use the word strip-search and that he was not expecting to witness one. \u201cNot initially, not until the first one,\u201d a volunteer who said he witnessed about six strip-searches at the festival told the inquiry. \u201cI was not expecting it.\u201d Adams repeatedly pressed the two volunteers who gave evidence at the inquiry on what they understood their role to be during the search. Asked whether it was correct to assume he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d the legal rights of a child during the search, the volunteer replied \u201cthat would be correct\u201d. While he said he acted with his \u201cbest intentions\u201d in acting as a support person, the volunteer conceded he didn\u2019t \u201cknow anything about these rules\u201d. After the event in February, police again contacted the SES to arrange volunteers to act as support people for an all-ages music festival held last weekend. On Thursday an SES unit commander told the LECC that only an hour after they arrived senior officials raised concerns about the presence of volunteers at a music festival and ordered them to leave. The unit commander said a memorandum of understanding between the volunteer organisation and police \u201cmay be reviewed given recent events\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
