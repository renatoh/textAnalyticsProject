City have spent over \u00a390m without counting the near-certain purchase of Wolfsburg\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne for \u00a358m. City have made a perfect start to the season and Pellegrini is aware there are high expectations. \u201cLast season we had some restrictions [net transfer spend] but I didn\u2019t give any excuse not to win the title. This team must try to win titles every year,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy because you have strong teams here in the Premier League and in the Champions League. \u201cBut we must try to do it. The best way to at least try is to have a good squad. That\u2019s what we are trying to do now and we finish on Tuesday when the transfer window is closed. After that you need to know how to play in the way we are doing. It\u2019s very important to have a good performance as players and as a team. So with more players or without players, I never had excuses about not winning titles.\u201d Sterling, who cost \u00a349m from Liverpool, is already showing signs of settling in. \u201cI said from the beginning the most important thing is not to talk about the price but the important thing is to see the performance in the next few years,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWe bought a player of 20 years old who scored 11 or 12 goals and gave assists for goals. All the prices of all the players are all very high this season so we are not clear about the price. We are sure that when we brought him he is a very good player who makes a difference in each game.\u201d Despite having only two strikers in Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Wilfried Bony, Pellegrini is not targeting another goalscorer in this transfer window. Bony is out of Saturday\u2019s match against Watford because of a leg injury. \u201cWe are not looking for another striker because we have Kun [Ag\u00fcero], we have Bony, we have Sterling who can play as an attacker, we have Kelechi [Iheanacho] and we have Patrick Roberts, so we are not going to bring in another player,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWe are going to have one position for a young player, Kelechi or Patrick.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
