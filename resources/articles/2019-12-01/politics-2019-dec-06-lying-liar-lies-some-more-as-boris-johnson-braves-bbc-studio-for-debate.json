The US. This has been an election dictated by the Sunbed God\u2019s kinks, where the bigger the lie and the more often it is repeated, the more chance you have of getting away with it. Just replace one overweight blond sociopath with another. When no one believes a word most politicians say, you might as well go for broke. Fantasy is so much more thrilling. The Conservatives have consistently thought big. The only person in the whole of Britain who believes the Tories will build 40 new hospitals is the needy spaniel, Matt Hancock. Yet Boris Johnson repeats it over and over again. On Friday\u2019s Today programme on Radio 4, Michael Gove \u2013 Westminster\u2019s very own primordial ooze \u2013 casually remarked that the reason the NHS was such a mess was because \u201cwe must all do better\u201d. I must have missed that bit when I served as a Tory minister. Labour has been outplayed. It has stuck to old-school exaggeration rather than outright fabrication. How very 2015. Even when Labour does tell the truth, no one gives a toss. Six days before polling, Jeremy Corbyn called a press conference. He had something big to reveal: he was going to allow a pallid Keir Starmer to sit alongside him on the platform for the first time in the entire campaign. There were hopes it might be one of Boris\u2019s missing children who had been found at a food bank. Instead, we had to make do with a leaked Treasury document that clearly showed Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would create a hard border down the Irish Sea and weaken the Northern Ireland economy. Boris had lied again. The only flaw was that Johnson\u2019s lies are the new normal, so the Labour expos\u00e9 was met with indifference. Whatevs. Even so, the Tory spin machine went into overdrive. First Boris said he hadn\u2019t read the report but was sure it was complete nonsense anyway. Touching to know he has such faith in his own Treasury team. Then CCHQ said it was just some rough jottings that an intern, who had since been fired, had knocked up on the basis of a deal that Boris had forgotten he had negotiated. Within hours the whole business was largely forgotten as the entire country had lost the will to live. Again. Shares in Dignitas must be soaring over the past few weeks. I\u2019ve certainly bought mine. At the start of the final leaders\u2019 debate, which appeared to have been set in the Blockbusters studio, the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson crossed his fingers as he hoped this one would be different from the previous ones. Some hope. Right from the off it was the same old, same old. We might as well not have bothered. Corbyn did try to keep bringing the debate back to some kind of reality, something which won him frequent rounds of applause, but Johnson was merely hellbent on doubling down on all the lies that had served him so well throughout the campaign. Within a minute he had told three old favourites. 50,000 nurses. 20,000 more police. Get Brexit done. One day he\u2019s going to find out that the Tories have been in government for 10 years and that no one had done more to prevent Brexit happening than him. For someone who has made a career out of lying, Boris is surprisingly bad at it. His tell-tale giveaways would be obvious to a five-year-old. He smirks, his eyes dart sideways and his arms shoot out in strange directions. This must be horribly familiar to so many women. Worse, Johnson is utterly shameless in his lying. He now acts like a participant in the Radio 4 panel show The Unbelievable Truth. Only no one has yet told him that one of the key elements of the game is that you are supposed to smuggle five truths into a tirade of lies. The topics were as predictable as the answers: Brexit, the NHS, security, Islamophobia and antisemitism. Both men had their wobbles, but at least there was a coherence to the Labour leader\u2019s attempts to answer questions. There was a seriousness to Corbyn that will always be beyond Johnson. There have been more intelligent sounds coming out of my arse than from the prime minister\u2019s mouth. There was a brief moment when Johnson\u2019s facade cracked a little. That was when a member of the audience asked about lies on the campaign trail. Boris smirked \u2013 of course he did \u2013 and said that would be a terrible thing and that anyone who did it should be held to account. Somewhere inside his subconscious there must be a desperate urge to be punished. Or at least to be called out. To be seen for the damaged child he is. As the hour came to a close, Johnson breathed a sigh of relief. It hadn\u2019t been great, but he\u2019d just about got away with it. Personal questions of trust and honesty had been kept to the bare minimum and no one had challenged him on his cowardice at refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. He\u2019d repeated a few untruthful slogans over and over again and it was job done. As so often, no one had really laid a finger on him because he is so well-defended. Often he doesn\u2019t even realise he\u2019s lying, it\u2019s so deeply embedded. He has become the nation\u2019s voice of mendacity. The man who lies so we don\u2019t have to. Lucky us.
