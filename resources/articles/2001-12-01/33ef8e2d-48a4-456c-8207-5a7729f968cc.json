Three days after his Newbury pipe-opener over hurdles, First Gold is looking good for his attempt to claim the chasing crown in Kempton's Boxing Day feature for the second year in a row. His trainer, Francois Doumen, is smiling in the gloom because he knows there is a \u00a3100,000 bonus for winning all three Grade One races on the opening day of the Sunbury track's Christmas festival. The stiff sand gallop of 2 miles, cut through the trees from the racing town's famous chateau towards Paris, thuds to the sound of Doumen's string as he reflects that he only needs First Gold to take the King George to become the most successful trainer in the history of the race. Both he and the late Fulke Walwyn are on five winners each. First Gold finished only third last weekend but his handler was not disappointed. \"Every year his comeback is the same. He is not really motivated and is a bit soft in his mind. Anyway, hurdling is not his proper game, steeplechasing is.\" Doumen's son Thierry has come in for some criticism over the year for his riding tactics and style, but his father springs to his defence: \"He is such a passionate boy about the sport. His mother and I worry every time that he has a fall, and hope he would stop. But he would only go and ride for somebody else. \"I would hate it if I was seen to be imposing my son on owners as a jockey. He has been a target for your press and commentators, but I am more than satisfied with him.\" Later, in the cafe just off the Rue de Mont Morency, Thierry gives his own views on First Gold's yuletide chances. \"When he feels he has superiority over the other horses in the race, he is happy. Last year in the event he found himself with so much gas that he just flew. Now, with age and experience, he thinks a lot more. He feels exceptional to ride.\" Doumen senior has news of an exciting new inmate at the satellite yard that he runs at Chantilly, a three-hour drive from his stud in Normandy. His new pride and joy is Kelami, a three-year-old gelding owned by the Queen Mother, who is being groomed for the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, the race Doumen won with Snow Drop last year. \"I spoke to her about him at Newbury and I am always surprised by her. She knows her jump racing inside out and I like the way that, at 101, she always looks forwards not backwards,\" the trainer said. The other elite races on Kempton's Boxing Day card counting towards the \u00a3100,000 jackpot are the Feltham Novice Chase and the Christmas Hurdle. Doumen thinks that his Innox will go well in the novice, having finished third to Katarino at Newbury on Saturday, while Bilboa will represent him in the big hurdle event. \"It was the first experience of English fences for Innox and he adapted well,\" the trainer said. \"He needs three miles and was running on at the finish last time. Bilboa is a beautiful mare, who used to be a bit of a puller but has calmed down lately. It is difficult not to be confident about First Gold in the King George after last year's performance. \"I aim to run the trio in a schooling session before the meeting at another English track yet to be decided, and which I won't be announcing. \"As a family we have not had a proper Christmas for ten years or so, ever since Nupsala won our first King George way back. We are always in England at that time of year, but we adore it. I love your racing because the English public are much more knowledgeable about their jumpers and give them their due credit. \"I feel so at home at Kemp ton. It has been a lucky course for me what with The Fellow's two King George victories there. I would love it if the Cheltenham Gold Cup was run there instead. It would be a great honour to break the record for wins in the King George. If it doesn't happen this year, then I have got plenty of time. I am still young.\" The Kempton two-day festival this year carries total prizemoney of some \u00a3400,000 but Doumen is also pointing Baracouda at Ascot's Long Walk Hurdle on the previous Friday as a Christmas bonus earner. Yesterday's Chantilly workout also saw Brian Clifford, the former jockey and now clerk of the course at Kempton and Wincanton, taking Djeddah for a spin. If conditions are to the 10-year-old's liking he may start in Cheltenham's cross-country race in a fortnight. Clifford reported: \"He felt wonderful and would take all the beating in that race.\" That said, Djeddah will probably be allotted top weight in the contest and hates the soft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
