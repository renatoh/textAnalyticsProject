Top stories If Malcolm Turnbull thought the Adani Carmichael coalmine was a political minefield exclusively for Bill Shorten, a new poll conducted in his own electorate may cause a rethink. The Australia Institute commissioned the poll of the Liberal-held electorates of Wentworth, which is Turnbull\u2019s, and Brisbane. It found 75% of voters in Wentworth (and 70% of Liberal supporters) would like to see the environmental approvals for the coalmine reviewed. In the seat of Brisbane, 59% supported a review, including 48.6% of LNP voters. \u201cAdani isn\u2019t just a potent issue in Batman,\u201d said Ebony Bennett, the thinktank\u2019s deputy director. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue on the government and the prime minister\u2019s plate right now.\u201d A majority voters in Turnbull\u2019s electorate, 64.7%, also agreed with the statement: \u201cAustralia must halt the expansion of coalmining and fast-track building wind and solar power and storage in order to effectively reduce the worsening impacts of climate change\u201d \u2013 including 54.2% of Liberal voters. A clear majority Liberal voters also favoured the adoption of a new rule to stop government agencies from putting taxpayer funds into coalmining projects. Residents of a small Queensland town have taken to social media to rally in support of a family of asylum seekers forcibly removed from their home a day after their visa expired. The Tamil family living in Biloela in central Queensland were woken at dawn on 5 March, given 10 minutes to pack and taken 1,500km to an immigration detention centre, where they have been told they will be deported. The family, Nadesalingam and Priya and their Australia-born daughters aged nine months and two years, were asked to sign \u201cvoluntary removal\u201d documents once they arrived in Melbourne, but say they signed under duress. Biloela, where Nadesalingam worked at the local meatworks, has set up a change.org petition to have the family released, and residents expressed their shock at the handling of the case. Donald Trump is facing criticism from Republican allies after apparently agreeing to meet Kim Jong-un without demanding that North Korea start scrapping its nuclear program. Senators from Trump\u2019s party expressed scepticism and urged him to set tougher preconditions, amid growing concerns over the administration\u2019s chaotic approach to nuclear diplomacy. The CIA director and the White House spokeswoman have also contradicted each other regarding the planned meeting. The president himself has offered little clarity, saying in a rambling speech at the weekend of North Korean denuclearisation: \u201cThey are thinking about that \u2013 who knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d There\u2019s been a lot said about the \u201cgenuine three-way contest\u201d in this weekend\u2019s South Australian election but rather less about about the fourth option on the ballot paper: the Greens. The party is fighting an uphill battle for coverage in a campaign dominated by Nick Xenophon. Its parliamentary leader, Mark Parnell, tells Max Opray about the difficulty of conveying his message, even after a leaders\u2019 debate on the environment that the Adelaide Advertiser said he had won. \u201cWhat struck me was on this double-page election spread, they\u2019d cropped me out of all the photos, and had seven pictures of Nick,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sour grapes, but that sums up how difficult it is.\u201d Hundreds of people who visited the pub and the restaurant in Salisbury where the Russian spy Sergei Skripal may have been poisoned have been told to wash their clothes and possessions. A full week after the attempted murder public health authorities said there may have been \u201climited contamination\u201d in both venues, with a risk from low repetitive exposure, prompting the \u201chighly precautionary\u201d warning. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, remain in a critical but stable condition. Police have identified more than 240 witnesses and 200 pieces of evidence. Sport Five sides remain realistically in contention for the AFLW grand final after shock wins to Collingwood and GWS. The veteran Courtney Gum was influential in her side\u2019s victory over the ladder-leading Bulldogs, her back story fittingly embodying the spirit of playing in a semi-professional league in a round dedicated to International Women\u2019s Day. An injury to another veteran in Mel Hickey, meanwhile, ended the round on a harrowing note. Shaun \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson may have run the Rabbitohs ragged but it was all thanks to Warriors recruit Blake Green doing the \u201cboring\u201d things well. He may yet prove to be the most influential recruit of the NRL off-season. Thinking time Stacey Dash sounds like a potential dream candidate for the Democrats, and the Clueless actor hopes for Trump\u2019s endorsement as she runs for Congress, telling Rory Carroll: \u201cHe\u2019s representing the people that I want to represent.\u201d But her conservative leanings have meant she has been \u201cblacklisted\u201d by Hollywood. \u201cI want to be a catalyst for change,\u201d Dash says. \u201cI was a Fox News contributor for quite some time and I\u2019m just done talking. I want to start doing.\u201d I left my serious job for the frivolous food industry, writes Lucky Peach founder Chris Ying. But if chefs can bring change to the table by backing sustainable food, consumers will follow. \u201cI won\u2019t get too deep into the nitty-gritty of restaurants\u2019 relationship to climate change, but the long and short of it is that growing, shipping, cooking and disposing of food is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. It\u2019s not impossible to counteract the effect \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s easier than people think \u2013 but it still takes time and thought and a little bit of money.\u201d Are grammar sticklers actually fighting against language change? If so, it\u2019s too late, writes Penny Modra. \u201cLanguages evolve \u2013 like viruses. English has been a very successful virus, now spoken by 1.5 billion earthlings thanks to its wily shape shifting. And these days, our human desire to somehow fix the language in place is being thwarted at a faster pace than ever.\u201d Media roundup The Australian Financial Review reports that Macquarie Bank\u2019s plans to wind up its Russian investment fund has hit a roadblock, as questions are raised about a deal with a US fraudster with links to a Georgian businessman once hunted by Interpol. The Adelaide Advertiser splashes with a South Australian council\u2019s resistance to the Auditor-General\u2019s Department\u2019s bid to inspect its finances, with the paper reporting \u201cmany\u201d local authorities say the increased transparency would cost ratepayers money and provide no benefits. Coming up The former Indonesian foreign minister Dr Marty Natalegawa will giving a public lecture on the future of Asean at the University of Sydney. The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and Mami Kataoka, the artistic director of the 21st Biennale of Sydney, will unveil Law of the Journey, a monumental 60-metre rubber raft installation at Cockatoo Island.
