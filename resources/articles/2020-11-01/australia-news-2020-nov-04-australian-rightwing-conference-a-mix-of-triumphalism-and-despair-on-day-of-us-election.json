Climate change was \u201cbull\u201d, mainstream news was \u201cfake\u201d and the Covid-19 pandemic was \u201ca lie\u201d. Wearing an Uncle Sam costume that he bought from a costume store in Newtown, in the city\u2019s inner-west, the one thing Sternhell seemed positive wasn\u2019t made up was the widespread voter fraud that the US president, Donald Trump, had spent the lead up to the election hyping. \u201cThe voting machines are run by George Soros,\u201d he told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. Sternhell was attending the second annual Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Sydney at which there was a strange mix of triumphalism and despair. On the one hand, as votes from states including Florida and North Carolina gave Republicans an early boost, the 300-strong crowd seemed to believe Trump had secured a second term in the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s already over, the journos are an hour behind,\u201d one attendee said to a friend. \u201cForget the journos, he\u2019s already won.\u201d Daniel Wild, a researcher from the conservative Institute of Public Affairs, was similarly bullish. \u201cTrump is going to win 2020 and it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThere will be Trump, and then there will be Trumpism which will go on, and it will be a great realignment for the western world for a generation, just like the one ushered in by Thatcher and by Reagan.\u201d And yet, through it all, a deeper sense of pessimism seemed to pervade the room. The former Liberal party MP and Sky News presenter Ross Cameron started the day off with a gloomy prediction that Australia had \u201ca 5% chance\u201d of surviving a broad and apparently unspecified decay. \u201cIf we are brutally honest with each other, we would say our culture is in decline,\u201d Cameron warned. \u201cWe would probably say our culture is in terminal decline. If we look at the birth rates, we\u2019re now down to 1.5% \u2026 I would give Australia about a 5% chance.\u201d Cameron never really articulated the threat he foresaw, and what birth rates had to do with it, but there was no shortage of speakers willing to give their bleakest assessment of the world for conservatives in 2020. Alan Jones, the Sydney radio shock-jock turned Sky News TV presenter, told the audience that a \u201csignificant indoctrination of our schools\u201d was under way. The political left, he said, was \u201con the march\u201d. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re only being hit by a bus [but] there\u2019s a concrete truck coming down the road,\u201d he warned. Alex Antic, a Liberal party senator, told the crowd that a \u201csilent majority\u201d of people believed \u201cthat it is not reasonable to run around tearing statues down\u201d, a reference to protests against monuments honouring racist figures. They wanted to be able to watch Chris Lilley programs on streaming services, he told the crowd. \u201cIf we lose the culture war arguments we lose the whole lot,\u201d Antic said. The threats, it seemed, were everywhere. When a single protester stood outside with a sign saying \u201cTrump failed 230,000+ Americans dead\u201d, one of the event\u2019s volunteers stood nearby and filmed himself calling him a \u201ccoward\u201d, though not loud enough for the protester to hear. \u201cThe communists are most likely to be triggered, and most likely cowards when they\u2019re on their own and not in packs \u2026 They are actually a bunch of lowest scums of the earth,\u201d the volunteer said. \u201cRemember ladies and gentlemen, when you see a communist, take them down and make them wet their pants.\u201d With the result of the presidential election still unknown late in the afternoon, the mood remained cautious. Though confident of a Trump victory, Sternhell remained worried. \u201cIt all depends on the fraud,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf it\u2019s free and fair and they can stop the fraud, Trump will win.\u201d Almost 17,000km from Washington DC, a few dozen Joe Biden voters clustered around televisions to watch the results at an official Democrats Abroad event at the Gilbert Street Hotel in Adelaide. The Democrats Abroad Australia chair, Kent Getsinger, said Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine confidence in the validity of mail-in voting wasn\u2019t just an affront to democracy, but the months of work the Kentucky native had put in encouraging his fellow Australia-based US citizens to vote. Getsinger and his team helped voters navigate the byzantine absentee ballot systems of American states. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit the phones hard since August, somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 calls,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is hard enough to vote from overseas as it is even without Trump\u2019s attacks, with some states using mail, some email, and others still using fax machines. [If Biden wins] we are hoping for voting reform.\u201d At another Democrats Abroad event in Sydney, supporters of Biden were anxious all day. \u201cThis is about climate, this is about the world, it\u2019s about how we move forward,\u201d Alex Dengate told Guardian Australia. \u201cNot just the USA but everyone. We need a leader who will work with the world to combat our challenges.\u201d \u201cLooking at the votes now, I thought we\u2019d have more blue states, I thought we\u2019d have a blue wave. It\u2019s scary to think that after all the devastation of Covid people still didn\u2019t come out and vote.\u201d \u2013 additional reporting by Max Opray and Mostafa Rachwani"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
