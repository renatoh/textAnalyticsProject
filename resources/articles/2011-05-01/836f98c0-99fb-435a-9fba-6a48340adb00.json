There are some promising new names, such as laidback Canadian Pat Burtscher or geezerish observationalist Matt Rudge, but there's also a lot of fairly identical stand-up. Festival-goers might be forgiven for wanting a break from all the earnest young men, and instead opting to take in some original sketch comedy. The Beta Males may look like any other set of young blokes straight out of university but they've got good writing behind them and an impressive presence, with bearded force of nature John Henry Falle a standout. Look out also for The Boom Jennies, a rare example of a high-quality, all-female sketch group. Lizzie Bates, Anna Emerson and Catriona Knox have a nice chemistry and an original approach, with enough laughs to suggest a big future. The Beta Males: Upstairs At The Three And Ten, Sat; The Boom Jennies: Upstairs At The Three And Ten, Wed to Fri Simon Evans: Fringe Magnet, On tour There are many unsung heroes on the stand-up circuit, who do first-class work week-in week-out but never seem to get the recognition they deserve. Simon Evans has been producing top-drawer routines for years, but now he's taking his career up a level with a well-received TV spot on satanic kingmaker Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow paving the way for this national tour. Evans has a rather unusual approach, appearing with the suit, bearing and clipped voice of a rather fusty headmaster. He's unashamedly upper-middle class, and delights in genially insulting his audience for their relative lack of breeding. But he's also hugely accessible, taking familiar subjects and investing them with new humorous life. There are no avant garde surprises here, but there is plenty of sophisticated comedy craft, and Evans could well have the chops to follow John Bishop and McIntyre himself into the mainstream. Lighthouse Arts Centre, Poole, Sat; Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Sun; Glee Club, Oxford, Thu Spymonkey, Hove The history of nudity in live comedy is not particularly glorious: an all-nude show in Edinburgh a couple of years back was performed by people you wouldn't pay to see nude (or indeed performing comedy). But now there's Spymonkey, a quartet of physical, experimental performers whose exploration of the wilder shores of clowning frequently sees them discarding all inhibitions and clothing. This latest show is a vaguely 60s-themed cabaret and features their habitual mix of whimsical concepts and full-throttle, anarchic crudity. Somewhere between a circus troupe and a performance art collective, they're unlikely to appeal to those who like their comedy in easy-to-identify packages. But for those willing to give in to Spymonkey's infectious mania, there are thrills galore here. The Old Market, Thu &amp; Fri"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
