Stoke have had an offer of \u00a34m accepted for Carson, and West Bromwich Albion are expected to match that bid, but Blackburn would be the favourites to sign the 22-year-old if Paul Ince follows up his interest. The Blackburn manager has been offered Tottenham's Paul Robinson but Carson is believed to be his first choice. Stoke City are expected to announce within the next 48 hours that Dave Kitson has agreed to join the newly promoted Premier League club for about \u00a33m. It is understood that Kitson's representatives have held talks with Stoke after Reading sanctioned the striker's departure. The 28-year-old, who had also been a target for Birmingham City, scored 60 goals during his 4\u00bd years with Reading, including 10 in the Premier League last season. Birmingham have instead signed Marcus Bent on a three-year contract from Charlton Athletic in a deal that could be worth more than \u00a31m. Derby County are willing to listen to offers for Robbie Savage, little more than six months after signing the midfielder from Blackburn for \u00a31.5m. Wigan Athletic, who yesterday completed the signing of Olivier Kapo from Birmingham for about \u00a33.5m, have offered \u00a33m for the Middlesbrough midfielder Lee Cattermole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
