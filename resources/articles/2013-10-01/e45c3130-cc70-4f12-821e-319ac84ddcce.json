It's a fairytale in a real-life setting, photorealistically drawn in shifting light that rivals Monet or GTA5. How exactly do you raise wolf children? Doctor or vet? School or mountainside? Like vampirism, lycanthropy here becomes a metaphor for puberty \u2013 for growing up and choosing your own path \u2013 but telling the story through the eyes of the harried, bereaved but indomitable mother gives this calm, funny, only occasionally schmaltzy family film a maturity Twilight never reached."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
