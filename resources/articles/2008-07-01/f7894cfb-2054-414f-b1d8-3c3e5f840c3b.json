The Zaragoza communications director, Luis Sol, said last night: \"He is about to sign a contract with Benfica. Between Zaragoza and Benfica everything is sorted out. The doors are open for Aimar to become a Benfica player.\" Newcastle have had similar luck in trying to persuade Anton Ferdinand to swap London for the north-east. Alan Curbishley, West Ham's manager, is believed to have been interested in a part-exchange for Damien Duff but Ferdinand did not want to move. It remains to be seen whether Duff, who has struggled at St James' Park since his \u00a35m arrival from Chelsea, will end up in east London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
