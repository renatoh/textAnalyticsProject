Almost three out of 10 of the larger shareholder groups registered dissent over rewards for top executives ahead of today's annual meeting. A substantial 28% of proxy votes either abstained or voted against a motion backing the bank's remuneration arrangements, while 13% followed a call from the National Association of Pension Funds (whose members own about one-fifth of the stock market through their investments) to abstain in a vote to re-elect chief executive Matthew Barrett. A further 5% voted against the motion. The NAPF has expressed its anger at a so-called \"golden parachute\" clause in Mr Barrett's contract which grants him up to twice his annual package in the event of a change of control at the bank. Last year Mr Barrett received \u00a31.7m in salary, bonus and other benefits. A NAPF spokesman said today: \"We hope Barclays will draw the right lessons from this vote and look to improve their remuneration arrangements in the future.\" Under new arrangements companies now have to put their remuneration report, which sets out the details of executive's salaries and bonuses, to a vote at their AGM. Chairman Sir Peter Middleton today defended Mr Barrett's record, saying the bank had been in the top quartile of its peers in terms of shareholder return - which includes both share price and dividend - for the last three years. That peer group includes 12 top international banks. Sir Peter said: \"Since Mr Barrett has been in charge of the bank, it has performed exceedingly well. It has produced top quartile results for the last three years.\" Last year Barclays' pre-tax profits fell 6% to \u00a33.2bn because of rising bad debts, but Sir Peter responded to concerns raised at today's meeting, saying: \"If you gave an instruction to our managers never to have a bad debt we would not be lending to anyone.\" Sir Peter also faced criticism from the floor over a 29% rise in his own remuneration to \u00a3528,000. One shareholder said: \"I trust you work 30% harder since you have had a 30% increase in pay.\" The vast majority of proxy votes are cast on behalf of the large institutional investors who own the largest number of shares. Final results which include the votes cast by individual shareholders at the meeting are expected later today or tomorrow. The vote follows a shareholder rebellion at oil giant Shell yesterday, when a protest on executive pay attracted 23% of the vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
