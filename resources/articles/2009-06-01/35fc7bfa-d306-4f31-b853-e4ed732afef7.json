The West Bromwich Albion manager had been linked with the post vacated by Gordon Strachan, who resigned at the end of the season after four years at Parkhead, and sources close to the club have now confirmed that the move will go ahead. The Scottish Premier League side will now unveil the 45-year-old as the new boss after the weekend. He beat competition in the form of Burnley's Owen Coyle and Motherwell manager Mark McGhee, who had also been considered possible successors to Strachan. It was known that Celtic's board held Mowbray in high regard. He played for the club between 1991 and 1995, and is credited with suggesting the player 'huddle' which is still employed before every match. He also earned plaudits for the style of his Hibernian side when in charge at Easter Road between 2004 and 2006. Mowbray took the reins at West Brom in 2006, and the Championship side narrowly missed out on promotion at the end of his first season. Mowbray chose to sell some high-profile players to restructure the playing staff, and the result was a victorious Championship campaign in the 2007-08 season. West Brom return to the Championship next season after finishing last in the Premiership, and Mowbray will now be in the unusual position of taking one of the highest profile managerial posts in Britain having presided over a relegation season at his previous club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
