For 8ish 350g dried tropical fruit like mango, banana, papaya, pineapple 50g caster sugar 200ml white rum 40g crystallized ginger half a tsp ground allspice 175g unsalted butter, softened 175g caster sugar 3 eggs 1 tsp baking powder 50g cornflour 200g plain flour A handful of toasted coconut curls Soak the fruit in the rum, sugar and about 200ml boiling water for as much as 3 days and as little as overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 150\u00baC/300\u00baF. When it comes to making the cake, drain the fruit (keeping the liquid) and roughly chop it or pulse very carefully in the food processor so that all the fruits are chopped a bit but not blitzed to look like candied peel. Meanwhile cream the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, then add the eggs one by one until totally incorporated. Sift the baking powder, flour and cornflour together and fold into the batter. Now turn in the chopped fruit, leaving a little to sprinkle on top of the cake. Prepare a loaf tin about 10cm x 20cm by lightly buttering and flouring it. Tip in the mix, sprinkle over the remaining fruit and put in the middle of the oven on a tray. Cook it for about an hour, until it passes the skewer test, and as that's happening reduce the remaining rum syrup on the hob in a little pan to a loose glaze. Fold the coconut curls into the brown sticky syrup and then once you've taken the loaf from the tin, spoon gently over the top."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
