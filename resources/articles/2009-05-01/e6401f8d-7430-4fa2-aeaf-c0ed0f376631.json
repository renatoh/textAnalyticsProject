It is in effect a cleaned-up version of heroin, and carries the same risk of overdose. Opioids are strong painkillers used routinely across the NHS to relieve severe pain in a patient who has had an operation or accident, or who has cancer, for example. History shows these drugs carry the risk of causing serious injury or death. Medical professionals are told to always exercise caution when using them. Diamorphine is recommended in official NHS guidelines for doctors who are working out of normal hours as the best medication to give a patient who has cardiac pain or is receiving palliative care. A senior doctor explained: \"Diamorphine is basically heroin. It's a pharmaceutical or purified version of heroin. It and morphine have the same effect. Diamorphine isn't stronger than morphine, but it does work quicker, so will sometimes be chosen for that reason.\" The National Patient Safety Agency says seven case reports were published between 2000 and 2005 into deaths caused by a high dose of diamorphine or morphine \u2013 that is, at least 30 milligrams \u2013 being given to a patient who had not previously received an opiate. In many of these cases, the doctor or nurse wrongly selected a 30mg ampoule of the drug instead of one of lower strength, causing an overdose. Between January and October 2005 the NPSA received 16 other reports of patient safety incidents involving the drugs that occurred in the NHS, mainly in hospitals, which left two people dead. As the NPSA explains: \"A high dose of these medicines can be too much for a patient who has not been given morphine or diamorphine before, and can cause breathing problems, unconsciousness and, in rare cases, be fatal.\" High doses should be given only to those who are on long-term pain relief and can tolerate receiving large amounts. One potential hazard is that although diamorphine and morphine are almost identical, doses of them are not therapeutically equivalent. For example, 30mg of diamorphine is the same as 45mg of morphine. Incidents in which patients died or suffered harm from a high dose of either drug prompted the NPSA in May 2006 to issues a safer practice notice to the NHS warning of the dangers they posed and ordering an overhaul of the procedures for their safe use. Worryingly, the agency says that all the problems it raised then have been rectified except for one: wrong doses. \"Since May 2006, when we had a plethora of concerns over everything from labelling to what is carried in GPs' bags, only one issue appears to remain of concern \u2013 'wrong dose or frequency of dose',\" said an NPSA spokeswoman. That admission suggests too little progress has been made in banishing one of the risks the NPSA identified in 2006, namely: \"Insufficient therapeutic training and understanding on the part of the healthcare staff of the risks and precautions when prescribing, dispensing and administering higher doses of diamorphine and morphine injections.\" Last July the NPSA issued a rapid response report to the NHS about the need to reduce dosing errors of opioids. It acted after receiving reports of five deaths and more than 4,200 dose-related patient safety incidents involving opioids up to June 2008. In the 10 months since last July the agency has received 1,081 further reports about staff giving patients wrong doses of opioids. Eight involved severe harm, but none led to a death. The NPSA recorded a total of 76,704 patient safety incidents involving medication of all sorts in 2007-08. They resulted in 43 deaths and 341 cases of severe harm. The fatalities included patients who had suffered an adverse reaction to a particular drug, been given the wrong dose or received another medication entirely from the one they needed. Dr Simon Ball, a consultant in kidney medicine at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham and an expert in drug safety errors, said: \"If 76,000 medication safety incidents are reported to the NPSA there will be a lot more on top of that. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe there's three-quarters of a million. While many cause no harm, some of those are bound to be very serious.\" Other senior doctors claim drug errors kill as many patients as superbugs such as MRSA and C-difficile. \"We don't know if that's the case, because figures for all medication incidents aren't kept. But it's possible,\" added Ball. \"We really need to put in place systems to stop these things happening.\" Independent patient safety specialists say incidents of harm or potential harm reported to the NPSA may be only 10% of the true number that actually happen. Reporting of such occurences is voluntary, anonymous, often sketchy and hard to verify. While the NHS is acutely aware of these problems, only a handful of hospitals have introduced electronic prescribing to tackle them. The Queen Elizabeth did so a decade ago. A network of computers in every ward \u2013 desktop, mobile and handheld devices that contain every patient's details \u2013 query a doctor's prescription if it looks unusual. \"For example, if I prescribed a kidney patient an anti-inflammatory drug, which is bad for the kidneys, the computer would ask me if I really wanted to do that. We think that introducing this technology has vastly improved patient safety,\" said Ball. However, he estimates that about only about six hospital trusts have put such procedures in place, with a few others introducing them now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
