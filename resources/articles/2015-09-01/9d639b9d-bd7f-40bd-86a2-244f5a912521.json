A motion at the Labour party conference, which begins on Sunday, is expected to call on the party to take advantage of break clauses in agreements between the government and private operators. Last week, the Labour leader announced that his party would take back routes as contracts expired rather than opening the contracts to new bids. The motion will cause further anxiety among some shadow cabinet members who believe the party is already too hostile towards big business under Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which is behind the conference motion, said Labour should consider speeding up re-nationalisation through invoking break clauses. \u201cThe franchises should be brought back into public ownership as they expire, but to accelerate this [Labour should think about using] break clauses within the franchises if this is in the interests of passengers.\u201d Every franchise would have a break clause through which the contract could be ended earlier than planned, Cortes said. \u201cIf Labour takes over [in 2020], only five franchises are up for [full] renewal over that parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time a private company [Railtrack] ran the tracks, we ended up with two major accidents at Hatfield and Potters Bar.\u201d It is understood that TSSA could use provisions for emergency motions to update their wording to welcome Corbyn\u2019s announcement on public ownership. Train drivers\u2019 union Aslef is expected to second the call. Its leader, Mick Whelan, said: \u201cWe will support any opportunity for the railways to be bought back into public ownership.\u201d On Sunday, Corbyn put forward plans for rail privatisation should he become prime minister in 2020, meaning a third of the railways would be in public hands by the end of his first parliament in 2025. In the runup to the election, former leader Ed Miliband stopped short of endorsing full re-nationalisation, saying that publicly owned enterprises could bid to take back contracts when franchises expired. In a sign he wants a clearer policy than his predecessor, Corbyn told the Independent on Sunday: \u201cWe know there is overwhelming support from the British people for a people\u2019s railway, better and more efficient services, proper integration and fairer fares. On this issue, it won\u2019t work to have a nearly-but-not-quite position. Labour will commit to a clear plan for a fully integrated railway in public ownership.\u201d Corbyn is not likely to have any difficulty getting the proposal through party conference, which has voted for rail re-nationalisation many times. Nor is it likely to prove particularly problematic with his shadow cabinet, although one member is thought to be against the use of break clauses. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and train operators, questioned the logic of enforced re-nationalisation by breaking with existing contracts. \u201cWhen rail franchising was introduced, the railway ran at a \u00a32bn-a-year loss in terms of its day-to-day costs but today, it virtually covers its running expenses. \u201cThere is more to do to improve rail services but why get rid of a model that is working for passengers and taxpayers?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
