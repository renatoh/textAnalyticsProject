The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like food sales fell by an annual rate of 2.2% during March to May, in contrast to a year earlier when turnover grew 0.7%. On one measure, it was the worst quarter for food sales since BRC records began in 2008. Non-food sales were better, buoyed by demand for TVs for the World Cup and summer clothes. \"While non-food retailers are seeing steady sales growth, the grocers appear locked in a race to the bottom, imposing price cut after price cut to maintain their sales volumes,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report's co-authors, KPMG. \"This price war is hindering the retail sector's overall recovery.\" Falling by 0.2%, food sales turned negative for the first time on record when measured in total rather than like-for-like terms and after excluding Easter distortions, the BRC said. The figures echo a report last week from the trade group showing food price inflation holding at a record low in May and prices overall in British shops falling. The deflation trend has eased the pressure on households after years of budgets squeezed by weak pay growth but caused concern among retailers. This latest research pointed to a growing divide between food and non-food sales. The BRC said clothing was the best performing category in May, helped by warmer weather. Aside from the usual boost to televisions, the World Cup saw demand pick up for collectibles and sticker magazines. Overall, sales growth for non-food items accelerated to 3.2% in like-for-like terms, ahead of 0.7% a year earlier. Taken together with food, that left overall retail sales up an annual 0.8%, just ahead of 0.7% a year earlier. For May alone, like-for-like retail sales were up 0.5%, down from 4.2% annual growth in April when figures were distorted by the later timing of Easter this year. Looking ahead, experts say retailers can draw some hope from the World Cup. \"Overall food and grocery sales for May were a further disappointment. For food retailers, it will be essential to capitalise on opportunities provided by the summer events and the World Cup in particular,\" said Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive at IGD, the data company providing the BRC report's food figures. Retailers will be hoping England play well enough to stay in Brazil beyond the group stage, says Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"The better England do and the more games they play, the bigger the potential beneficial impact to retail sales. And if England do well, it could give a small, temporary boost to consumer confidence, although this is already elevated at the moment,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
