Fancy footwear retailing at \u00a331 for a set of four will be worn next month by alsatians on crowd control and at public order incidents, and taking part in house and drug searches. They were modelled yester day by Buzz, the first police dog in the country to go to work with its uniform around its ankles. Looking slightly reluctant, he demonstrated their non-slip and broken glass-resistant qualities in Newcastle upon Tyne. \"We are leading the way when it comes to the safety of our four-legged colleagues,\" said PC Alex McLeod, the force's public order instructor, who put Buzz through his comfortably protected paces. \"There have been occasions where dogs couldn't be deployed because they would have been at risk of injuring their paws. \"The boots will also help when an officer is searching premises for a suspect after a burglary. There's often glass on the floor but now Buzz and his colleagues can safely be used in the search.\" The footwear is made by Canine Spirit, originally to stop yacht decks being paw-marked and dogs falling into the sea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
