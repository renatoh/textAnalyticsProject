Start wearing them now with thick tights and they'll take you through to September or thereabouts. Shorts are also easier to wear than a skirt of similar length as they're less revealing and so totally fit for purpose. Be that purpose a pub lunch, a walk in the park or even, if you're lucky, a relaxed office. Clockwise from top: Pale pink shorts \u00a332, by Topshop. Culottes \u00a399, by YMC, from asos.com.
