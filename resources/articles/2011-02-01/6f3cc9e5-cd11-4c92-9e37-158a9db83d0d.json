He came to prominence during a brief loan at Rushden &amp; Diamonds, scoring nine goals in 16 appearances. A transfer to Scunthorpe followed, where he scored more than a goal a game, and sealed a \u00a32m return to his home-town club. He managed eight goals in two seasons, but has since found success at Doncaster under Sean O'Driscoll. View from the terrace To label Billy Sharp as simply a goalscorer would do him a disservice, even if he is currently chasing an England international striker (Jay Bothroyd) to be the Championship's top scorer. With tireless effort, unselfish team play and important assists you can see why his strike partner, James Hayter, and the rest of the team love playing with him. I'm sure the \"fat lad from Sheffield\" will be looking to at least double his current goal tally before the end of the season and few Rovers' fans would bet against it.
