But the only front likely to be opened up is in south Lebanon, where there is no Arab army, only Hizbullah - in its way the most formidable military adversary Israel has faced. They confront each other along the frontier's 70-mile length from the Shebaa farms high in the rugged foothills of Israeli-occupied Mount Hermon, where Israel, Syria and Lebanon converge, to a lush Mediterranean coast. Ever since Israel's withdrawal from its south Lebanese \"security zone\" nearly two years ago, Hizbullah militiamen, not Lebanese soldiers, have manned a score of frontline positions. They have been stockpiling weapons in secret locations, monitoring Israeli movements, training and drawing up battle plans; they are reportedly in a state of high psychological and military readiness. The more the conflict in the occupied territories deepens, the more likely it is that they will come to blows because it is to the Palestinian struggle that Hizbullah now avowedly links its own. Wednesday night saw the heaviest single Hizbullah artillery onslaught on Israeli positions at Shebaa since the withdrawal: 116 mortars, according to Unifil (the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon), in two and half hours. \"We can't see anything of it,\" said Ajai Touma, Indian commander of the local Unifil observation post. \"They just shoot and scoot.\" Further Hizbullah rocket and anti-tank missile attacks on Israeli positions in the Shebaa farms area yesterday raised tension further. Israeli troops responded with artillery fire on the Lebanese border town of Kfar Shouba. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Unifil observers were impressed by the high professionalism of Wednesday's coordinated assault. \"I think,\" said one with experience of Afghanistan and central Asia, \"that, in addition to its high motivation, this is the most disciplined, organised and educated Islamic militia I've seen. If they ever did get that order from their leadership, I'm sure they would fight to the last drop of blood.\" But no such order will surely ever come - at least not just out of the blue. It has so far been a carefully controlled and calibrated form of warfare, with its own rules, that is newly unfolding along the frontier. But that does not mean there might not be a full-scale reignition of what for a quarter of a century before the Israeli withdrawal had been the last militarily active front in the Arab-Israeli struggle. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hizbullah has faced a choice. Should it remain true to its pan-Islamic, jihadist mission, which, by definition, would not be complete without the liberation of Jerusalem's holy places from the Zionist usurper? Or, the liberation of Lebanese territory complete, should it become, exclusively, an ordinary Lebanese political party? In practice, it deferred the choice by declaring the liberation incomplete. By suddenly discovering and proclaiming that the Shebaa farms are actually Lebanese, not Syrian, territory it retained a rationale for its continued \"resistance\" under a Lebanese banner. Then, four months after the Israeli withdrawal, the eruption of the intifada greatly favoured the jihadist option. And, from being an inspiration and model for Palestinian militancy, Hizbullah has ever since been drawn inexorably towards direct involvement in it. Last August its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said his party was \"getting ready for direct military intervention from Lebanon.\" The main questions, for a leadership known for its careful planning and judicious assessment of risk, were always: when and how? \"When we enter with all our strength on the side of the intifada, we must choose the right time, because the current confrontation cannot afford mistakes in timing, strategy, or the size of the act.\" Above all, Hizbullah wants to avoid any appearance of a deliberately unprovoked attack, falling outside its own definition of legitimate, Lebanese resistance, that is liable to bring down large-scale Israeli retribution on Lebanese and Syrians. But the conflict in Palestine is pushing it towards bolder courses, the clear rhetorical escalation of the past few months has been matched, in the past week, by a military one too. Shebaa has been hotting up dangerously; but, more seriously still, it is no longer strictly true that Hizbullah is confining its escalation to \"legitimate\" targets there. There have been other, very significant cross-border attacks - including a raid in which six civilians died, a Katyusha rocket that fell near Qyriat Shmona and, on Thursday night, some nine armour-piercing Grad missiles fired at a radar station on Syrian territory close to, but not part of, the Shebaa farms - which, were Hizbullah directly responsible for them, would amount to a very grave, qualitative leap from mere resistance against Israeli occupation to assault on Israel proper. Hizbullah, in fact, denies any part in them, but, for Unifil officials, there is little doubt that, given its total control of the frontier, it connived in at least some of them. The likely culprits, they think, were Palestinians. Israel's prime minister Ariel Sharon says that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine general command, a Hizbullah ally, fired the Grads - and the Lebanese government, now deeply alarmed, says it has managed to arrest some of the perpetrators. The Qiryat Shmona Katyusha rocket was apparently of the short-range, first-generation type found in the Palestinians' arsenal in the 70s. Hizbullah possesses Katyushas in abundance - 8,000 of them, according to Israel - with a range of at least 40 kilometres; if they also possess a longer-range, third-generation model, it could, from its new positions on the frontier, strike Israel's third largest city, Haifa. One Unifil official said: \"The Israelis are aware of the grave implications of opening up a second front, but, their patience almost exhausted, they have let us know they are very close to massive retaliation.\" Any such onslaught that caused heavy loss of civilian life or \"infrastructural\" destruction would, as in the old days, furnish Hizbullah with the pretext it may be waiting for to unleash Katyusha havoc on northern Israel. That would dramatically broaden and intensify the regional and international crisis that has been latent in the intifada from the outset."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
