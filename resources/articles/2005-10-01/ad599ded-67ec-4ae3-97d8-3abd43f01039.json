If you're not trying to work out whether you should mention your new product before or after coffee, you're busy worrying whether your boss will agree that four vodkas before six o'clock was money well spent. Luckily you can make it all a lot simpler by deciding beforehand why you are treating the lucky devils to a free lunch. Then you will know whether you can relax and order pudding or whether you ought to be staking out their chicken fricassee with a pen, contract and possibly a mean glint in your eye. 2 Once you know what you are hoping to achieve, choose your venue wisely A quick word about what is ambiguously termed \"lap dancing\" (presumably \"strip joint\" doesn't look quite so elegant on one's expense form). Just Say No. Take into account the preferences of your guest. Nude avant-garde Kabuki theatre may not be quite what your shy, retiring distributor was expecting. On the other hand, treat a trendy fashionista to a soft drink in a quiet bar near the office and you may be saying \"Mwah, mwah, ciao!\" quicker than you can say Jimmy Choo. 3 If you are lucky and the finance director is on holiday, you may get to go somewhere that merits a clean shirt and a bit of shoe polish. In the excitement, however, try to avoid the temptation to go over the top. Dress appropriately. You may be going Up Town but that's no reason for your skirt to go To Town. Dressing badly is not gender specific. Gentlemen, the belief that day-glo trainers are just the thing to impress at a black-tie dinner seems to be quite widespread. Remember: day-glo is reserved for those who work in \u00fcber-fashionable Hoxton, and I believe that rules it out altogether. 4 I hate to sound like a rather pompous dinner lady, but table manners are important. Yes, still. Reality TV might be all the rage these days, but no one wants to see exactly what happens after that ballotine of salmon leaves your fork, so please remember to eat with your mouth shut. The same goes for waving your cutlery around and leaning across the table. On the other hand, tut-tutting if your guest uses the wrong fork is the height of bad manners. Anyone who indulges in this sort of outmoded snobbery deserves to languish in a hell comprised solely of fish knives and Hyacinth Bucket for company. 5 While we are still at table (waiting for everyone to begin, naturally) there is another, rather upsetting, thing to remember. Never mind curbing your enthusiasm, you may have to curb your appetite. It might defeat the purpose of having chosen a good restaurant, but however delicious it looks, avoid anything complex or messy. If it splashes, squirts, drips or involves cracking, twirling or finger-licking, it's off the menu. The resultant tomato stain on your blouse is always humiliating, and however yummy, it's just not worth it. Honestly. 6 People (OK, mostly Americans, presumably mistaking the entire nation for Miss Marple) are always going on about the Great British Reserve. In most cases, this is because they have never been to any of our great cities on a Saturday night (where the only reserve on display is the careful stockpiling of alcopops). Having said that, a little restraint is always appropriate when it comes to talking shop. By all means talk about work, but if you are supposed to be getting to know each other better, a 10-minute presentation on maximising profit won't go down well. On the other hand, if you are in the lucky position of being the client, then go for it. This is one occasion where the anecdote about your hamster's diarrhoea will be listened to with respectful enthusiasm. 7 However jolly the outing, never forget you are still at work. Admittedly, it can be confusing. One minute you are surrounded by filing cabinets, the reassuring whirr of the photocopier and a good view of Tiffany from accounts. The next thing you know you're in a dimly-lit bar, fags to the ready, with only George from Soft Tissue Limited, prattling on about loose weaves, to remind you it's not a regular night out on the town. Those who fail to recognise the distinction between work and non-work always come a cropper. A drunken bear hug is probably not the most straightforward way to impress your boss, your client or, indeed, Tiffany from accounts. 8 Never get drunk. OK, almost never get drunk. Naturally, the difficulty lies in that \"almost\", because sometimes it is inappropriate to remain sober. The most sensible course is to quaff whatever delicious bubbliness is sent your way, but remember: anyone who tries to encourage you to actively pursue drunkenness (in traditional British fashion) is not your friend. Usually they have a dark place, where lingering worries about the time they were caught aloft the photocopier reside. They want you to have a dark place, too. Resist their call to the bar at all costs. 9 Hopefully, your evening will end with much bonhomie and camaraderie, so when it comes to demonstrating your largesse, make sure you have cleared it with accounts first. There's nothing more embarrassing than discovering the company credit card doesn't cover eight bottles of Cristal and dinner for 17. 10 Last, no matter how well it has gone, and no matter how drunk you are, don't forget to collect the receipt - \u00a31,872 in \"miscellaneous expenses\" never goes down well, and can be difficult to explain when you roll back into the office, a bit tipsy, having left the signed contract with the head waiter in lieu of a tip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
