Stephanie Cole, 25, had left her car outside her parents' house in Great Glen, Leicestershire. She paid the \u00a3700 bill herself because she has been unable to find out which plane the football-size chunk fell from. Harborough MP Edward Garnier wants the Department for Transport to pay for tests on the ice. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said airlines had no control over ice that fell from an aircraft's fuselage. Such incidents were rare, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
