Jacques Rogge said that Athens's preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games were like the dance immortalised by Anthony Quinn in Zorba the Greek - the hero started off slowly, took one step forward, one step back, before leaping into the air and pacing frenetically. In just over a year the Games are due to return to their ancient birthplace and one of the politest descriptions used of the Greek approach to the biggest event it has ever held is 'shambolic'. Greece is nowhere near ready to host the 2004 Olympics. This weekend Prime Minister Costas Simitis exhorted Greeks to abandon their 'last-minute' approach. The Zorba leap, it seems, is well overdue and the scale of the problem is beginning to hit home. The biggest issue is beds. Athens simply doesn't have the space to sleep the two million-plus spectators expected at the world's premier sporting event. Schemes from shipping in floating hotels to encouraging locals to take in guests and pushing prostitutes out of brothels to use them as temporary hostels are all under way. Despite the gloss the Greeks give their capital - Mayor Dora Bakoyianni announced last Tuesday that all apartment blocks will get a heavily subsidised facelift alongside plans to embellish Athens with 172,000 new trees and 1.6 million shrubs - the accommodation issue remains critical. As ticket sales soar and everyone from prostitutes to priests weighs in with a word about the 'Olympic spirit', the scale of the problem has begun to hit home. 'It's a disaster, an absolute shambles,' said British-born Deborah Gaitanou, a local real estate agent who has followed it closely. 'Where are we going to put all these people? Not in hotels, that's for sure, because 90 per cent of all of them have been booked by Athens 2004 for members of the Olympic family [VIPs, officials, judges, sponsors and the media].' The shortage is such that official contingents from some of the 200 countries taking part - not least in Africa - have been asked to 'prune down' their numbers. Athletes may be housed in the Olympic village but other staff will be accommodated in military academies, renovated student halls or as far away as Cape Sounion, a 90-minute drive from the capital. 'If we ever win the Games we're going to put the Greeks in Argentina,' grumbled one Brazilian on hearing he'd been relocated to the resort spa of Loutraki near ancient Corinth. Initially, the organisers had come up with the innovative solution of hosting people on cruise ships. In April it was announced that 11 luxury liners had been assigned to berths in Piraeus - including the still unfinished but resplendent Queen Mary II, one of the biggest vessels in the world. The floating hotels would provide at least 6,500 cabins. But ticket sales - even for the Queen Mary - have been unexpectedly low. 'It's not just that it's more difficult to secure an open space; people don't like ships, they don't want to feel like a prisoner in a gilded cage,' said Gaitanou. 'It might still be early days but floating hotels didn't work in Sydney, either.' Even if they wanted to, others say the cost of the cruise ship option is prohibitive. No other Olympics has been invested with quite as much symbolism as these, the first in Athens since the modern Games were revived in 1896. In the face of the looming crisis, travel agents say visitors are prepared to go that extra mile. Already, the seriously rich have begun booking helicopter space and villas on islands as far away as Mykonos. Others, reportedly, are even considering basing themselves in Nato rival Turkey - Istanbul is just over an hour's flight away. Organisers say both are 'ridiculous' given the success of their latest scheme to resolve the issue: home rentals. Over the past few months the consortium set up to manage private properties has been besieged by Athenians prepared to vacate their homes for the 16-day Games. The only problem is that most Greeks see the programme as a way of becoming an instant millionaire. With homeowners asking as much as \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,800) a night, the Athens Olympics could be some of the most expensive, even if tickets are some of the cheapest starting at \u20ac10 euros a piece. While similar schemes operated in other Olympic cities, including Sydney, they were on a much smaller scale. But, with Athens shrouded in scaffolding and sports venues turned into massive construction sites, the capital is also changing. Tourists have marvelled at its fabulously restored buildings, new roads, airport, metro station and pedestrian walkway uniting its classical heritage into a giant archaeological park. 'No one believed the new Athens airport would ever be finished and yet it was,' said Alexandra Baumann, a French tourist. 'The Greeks like to put everything off until tomorrow, but you'll see when the time comes the planes will be pouring in. Which country, after all, can combine Greece and the Olympics? It's simply unbeatable.' That's if Zorba makes that jump - and dances very fast indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
