Covid-19 has caused the suspension of football since early March and there is uncertainty over when it will return. Woodward pointed to this when assessing the level of finance Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r may have to strengthen his squad. \u201cNobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be \u2018business as usual\u2019 for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer,\u201d he told a United fans\u2019 forum via conference call. \u201cAs ever our priority is the success of team. But we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality. \u201cOn this basis, I cannot help feeling that speculation around transfers of individual players for hundreds of millions of pounds this summer seems to ignore the realities that face the sport.\u201d As reported by the Guardian, the uncertainty means United have recognised that buying a striker of the value of Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane \u2013 around \u00a3150m \u2013 is unrealistic. However Woodward said a global, multi-sponsor model gave United robustness. \u201cIt is also important to acknowledge the part played by our successful business in allowing us to fulfil our social responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have always believed that our commercial model gives us greater resilience than most clubs and we are grateful for the enduring support of our commercial partners.\u201d Woodward acknowledged that games may initially be staged behind closed doors. \u201cWe are eager to see the team return to the field as soon as we are advised it is safe to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully to complete a season which still held so much promise for us in the Premier League, the Europa League and the FA Cup when it was suspended. We are in constant dialogue with our governing bodies about when and how that will happen and we will continue to engage with this forum to keep fans consulted. \u201cAnd while it may be that games need to be played behind closed doors in the shorter term, we all recognise that football will not be fully back to normal until supporters are once again in attendance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
