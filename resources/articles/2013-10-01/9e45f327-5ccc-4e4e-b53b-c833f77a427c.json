Speaking in the BBC's Radio Theatre, Hall will emphasise the need for a better, simpler BBC, as part of efforts to streamline management. He will also argue that his job is now to put money into the quality of programme-making and that he wants to see \"a more personalised\" BBC. New technology, he will suggest, is best used to allow viewers more ways to watch what they want to see. Lord Hall will also be relaunching The Space, the BBC's experimental digital arts service developed in partnership with Arts Council England, a project that had been widely criticised for failing to make an impact. \"Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are. But I want us to be much more ambitious. We need to showcase more of the incredible talent this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences. It is our privilege and responsibility to do this,\" said Hall, ahead of the announcement. A new arts brand, \"BBC Arts at\u2026\" will draw attention to arts programmes and allow audiences to find the content they want. New programmes will include The Big Picture, a primetime BBC1 six-part series to showcase \"hidden heroes\" in the visual arts. Ten amateurs will compete to be crowned Britain's best artist. There will also be a one-off, live performance on BBC2 to mark the National Theatre's 50th anniversary. A new generation of BBC partnerships with national arts institutions such as Tate, the British Museum, the National Theatre and Manchester International Festival is also promised. The Space is to be relaunched in the spring as a dynamic new arena for artists and audiences to invent and explore brilliant digital art. Artists and arts organisations will be able to submit work through a rolling programme of \"open calls\", which will encourage new and emerging talent, as well as established artists, from early next year. Alongside these, The Space will co-commission large, ambitious digital projects with cultural organisations, creative industry and arts partners, broadcasters, digital commissioners and commissioners within the BBC. A whole range of arts organisations, large and small \u2013 including the British Library, Artangel and Fuel \u2013 are ready to work with The Space on new commissions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
