There was no anger, only tired exasperation. He had already discharged his rage at half-time as his side toiled at Hull City and, although Liverpool improved after that impassioned team-talk, they could not halt their dreadful start to 2017. Afterwards Klopp suggested it was time for some home truths. From the team\u2019s mentality to Simon Mignolet\u2019s latest error, he was blunt \u2013 facing mistakes head-on would be a priority before Saturday\u2019s game at home to Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cAgain that\u2019s another thing where we have to show a reaction,\u201d said Klopp when asked about Mignolet\u2019s confidence, the goalkeeper having flapped at the ball in the buildup to Alfred N\u2019Diaye\u2019s opening goal at the KCom Stadium. \u201cThat\u2019s causing problems. That\u2019s how it is. For sure he was not alone around the goal but of course he nearly had it in his hands. We cannot ignore this is true and we will not. We don\u2019t lie to ourselves. \u201cI saw in the Hull set piece that our formation was not right, after one second of the set piece. It\u2019s all about concentration. It\u2019s all about being really in the game and finding the answer after a defeat that really hurts, not just myself but the players too. Putting ourselves under pressure is a hobby of ours and now we have to show a reaction.\u201d Liverpool have won one match in 10 this calendar year, across all competitions. That was a narrow victory over a side in League Two and the big games will come quickly over the next month and a half. Arsenal, Manchester City and Everton loom large on the fixture list after Tottenham. Yet Liverpool have performed admirably against their direct rivals at the top end of the Premier League this season. It is the displays against lower-ranked opponents that have caused concern and the one at Hull was familiarly frustrating. They put Marco Silva\u2019s side under some pressure in the second half, yet the first goal was easily preventable and Liverpool\u2019s defence \u2013 with Lucas Leiva and Jo\u00ebl Matip as centre-halves \u2013 appeared fragile throughout. Going forward the energy and zip of early season has faded, with opponents opting to sit back and attempt to play on the counterattack. To rub salt into the wound it was Oumar Niasse, the forward on loan from Everton, who killed the game with a late second goal following a simple long ball over the top. Klopp, though, insisted there was a way back from the slump and that his self-belief had not wavered. \u201cYou cannot believe how many questions I ask myself, even when we win five or six nil,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m perfect. Things like this don\u2019t change that. I feel 100% responsible for defeats, much more than I feel for wins. It has been like this my whole life. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for me not suffering or to be sorry for yourself, to have self-pity. I\u2019m not like this. \u201cWhen I get up tomorrow I will only be solution-orientated. There are solutions, 100%. Now we have to change it \u2013 that\u2019s a football thing. Even though at this moment it feels really bad, it\u2019s not the biggest problem in the world. Many teams have already made mistakes and changed things. For this you have to do the right things and I\u2019m quite confident we can do the right things.\u201d The goalkeeper dilemma has been a blight on Liverpool\u2019s progress this season and Mignolet, who saved Diego Costa\u2019s penalty against Chelsea last week, was once more a key influence on the result. However, the Belgian was left woefully exposed by a defence that did not react quickly to Harry Maguire\u2019s header from a corner as N\u2019Diaye scored from inside the six-yard box. For Silva there was much encouragement from the performance of his winter signings, in particular N\u2019Diaye and Andrea Ranocchia, who started in defence after a late injury to Michael Dawson. Liverpool\u2019s quiet January has put the spotlight on their squad but Klopp was reluctant to point towards excuses for his team\u2019s malaise. Asked whether new signings would have prevented this run, he said: \u201cFirst of all I think what is very important is to never blame anybody else for your own mistakes. We don\u2019t look for excuses. It\u2019s not that we are trying to blame somebody. We are responsible, the squad, myself especially. We have to work on a solution and we will.\u201d Hull, however, deserve much credit. Silva has provided them with genuine hope of avoiding relegation, weeks after joining. He said: \u201cI am not a miracle worker but that is not important. I am a worker. I want to work and keep our goal in our minds always but my feet always stay on the ground. I want three points, nothing more. We need to take a lot more points to keep Hull City in the Premier League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
