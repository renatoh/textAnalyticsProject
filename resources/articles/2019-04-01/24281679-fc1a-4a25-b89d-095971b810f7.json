And on this evidence, Aaron Ramsey is worth every penny of the reported \u00a3400,000 a week he will receive as a Juventus player over the next four years. More than a few eyebrows were raised in February when it was announced the Wales international would be moving to Serie A in the summer after running down his contract yet against one of Italy\u2019s most respected sides, Ramsey delivered a performance which underlined just how good he can be. Since the deal was confirmed, he has been the driving force in the revival of Unai Emery\u2019s side as they have reignited their top-four challenge and now have an excellent chance of reaching the Europa League last four for the second season in succession. If only he had managed to slot home a golden opportunity 15 minutes from time that would have given them a 3-0 advantage heading into the second leg next week then Ramsey could already be contemplating the prospect of rounding off his Arsenal career with another trophy. Three FA Cup winners\u2019 medals are all he has to show for more than a decade\u2019s service in north London and that seems a paltry return for a player who summed up the malaise of the second half of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s reign. Ramsey will earn slightly more than what Mesut \u00d6zil is currently on. Yet with the former Germany international clearly in the mood after his tepid display as captain in the defeat against Everton on Sunday, the midfield duo were unplayable at times as Napoli\u2019s defence were left chasing shadows. It made you wonder what might have been had they been selected in the same side more often over the years. Ramsey\u2019s goal after 15 minutes typified his qualities. Having intercepted the ball just inside his own half, the next time he touched the ball was to stroke it into the corner of the net with a precise side-footed finish having sprinted 50 yards to make sure he was in position for the cutback from Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Operating from a deeper position that allows \u00d6zil to occupy his favourite space between the lines, Ramsey was able to dictate the game with his supreme range of passing, choosing his moment to dart into the box in anticipation of the goal-scoring opportunity. After Carlo Ancelotti had straight-batted questions about his relationship with \u00d6zil at Real Madrid before the match, this was one of those occasions \u2013 all too rare these days sadly \u2013 where he showed just why Arsenal were prepared to make such an enormous investment to bring him to the club in 2014. Ancelotti had originally criticised the midfielder\u2019s decision to leave Spain, claiming he did not have the stomach to fight for his place. Yet he also admitted a year later it had been a mistake to sell \u00d6zil at a time when Real were struggling for creativity and the 30-year-old gave his former manager a timely reminder of his talents, with the pirouette that took him away from two markers just inside the Napoli half simply breathtaking. Whether he can have quite the same impact in the second leg in Naples next Thursday remains doubtful given his usually anonymous performances on the road, although Arsenal seemed intent in settling this tie on the night during a barnstorming first half in which Lucas Torreira scored from a shot that deflected in off Kalidou Koulibaly. The Senegal international had started the game with two imperious blocks to deny Ramsey and then Maitland-Niles and looked a formidable obstacle to overcome. Yet even a player who is expected to cost up to \u00a390m should he complete a much-speculated move to the Premier League this summer struggled to keep up with the pace dictated by Ramsey and \u00d6zil, although he did come close to securing a priceless away goal with a thumping header from a corner. Manchester United are reported to have made a bid for him and Unai Emery would no doubt love to add the 27-year-old to his ageing backline, even if he is likely to be out of Arsenal\u2019s price range. Wenger attempted to sign him in 2016 for around \u00a320m but was rebuffed, and Napoli have since resisted numerous bids for a defender who is rated as one of the world\u2019s best. Whether Koulibaly will still be around next season when Juventus come to town or not, he will know all about Ramsey after this display."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
