Poll is little loved by either Arsenal or Manchester United, despite his decision to allow Thierry Henry to hit a quickly taken free-kick beyond Chelsea's Petr Cech earlier this season. The 41-year-old may have the temperament to thrive in the volatile atmosphere in north London this evening, though his ability to infuriate those in the dug-out persists. It was at St James' Park earlier this season, in the wake of United's 3-1 win over Newcastle, that Ferguson launched a scathing attack on Poll's refusal to award his side two penalties during the previous week's goalless Manchester derby. \"Last week was ridiculous,\" growled the Scot. \"Poll never gives us penalty-kicks and that's a well-known fact. Last year at Highbury Ryan Giggs was brought down. The year before at Chelsea - clear penalty-kick when Paul Scholes was brought down.\" Poll's appointment for the corresponding fixture last season, in which he denied Giggs a penalty following a challenge from Sol Campbell during the 1-1 draw, had been controversial enough given that he had not previously officiated at Arsenal since December 2001. That night he had controversially awarded Newcastle a penalty and sent off Ray Parlour as the visitors won 3-1, prompting Henry to confront the referee angrily on the final whistle. Arsenal subsequently complained to the Football Association about his performance. \"That was well over two years ago and he has not been back since,\" fumed Ferguson at the time. \"It's almost like they are deciding who the referee is going to be and that is very disappointing. It is an immense pressure for any referee to be under because if he has another bad game, he doesn't get back again. It's ridiculous.\" Not that pressure tends to affect Poll, who has officiated in FA Cup finals and at the 2002 World Cup and believes he has a good working relationship with managers. \"If there is a problem during the game then, in the following week, I will contact the manager to discuss it. \"It is something I do. Sometimes I have to accept that the manager is right and I ring him up, not to change his mind but to ask him to try and see it from my point of view even if I am wrong. Relations are better than many people may think.\" \"Graham will seek to gain control from the first ball,\" said the former referee Jeff Winter. \"My fingers are crossed for him, but these are the games everyone wants to take part in. I think the fact that Chelsea have gone so far ahead [means] it may not be as volatile a game as it has been in the past.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
