Sportinglife.com, which was set up by the Press Association and Trinity Mirror before being sold last year to UKBetting, will supply FT.com with coverage of all sports including football, tennis, cricket, golf and horseracing. The deal is the latest attempt by Sportinglife.com's owner to broaden the user base of its sites. Last year it bought former dotcom high flier Sportal.com and earlier this year acquired sports site and radio station Teamtalk. \"The content from Sportinglife ensures our users will benefit from exceptional sports news and commentary within the familiar area of FT.com,\" said the FT.com chief operating officer, Zach Leonard. The Sportinglife.com content will be available to all FT.com users, not just subscribers to the site's premium service. Since it introduced a subscription charge for some areas of the site in July, FT.com has attracted about 20,000 paying customers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
