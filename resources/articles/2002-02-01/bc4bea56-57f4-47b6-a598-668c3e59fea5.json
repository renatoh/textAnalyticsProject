Akinbiyi, who has scored twice in 16 starts this season, has not justified the club-record fee of \u00a35m Peter Taylor paid Wolves for him 18 months ago, and the Leicester manager Dave Bassett has opted to cut their losses and sell the 27-year-old for \u00a32m. Bassett will use the money to sign an experienced striker in an 11th-hour attempt to save the Foxes from relegation. Dougie Freedman and Clinton Morrison have accounted for 41 of Palace's 58 league goals this season, but the manager Trevor Francis has little in reserve and sees Akinbiyi's knack of unsettling defences as providing even more chances. The Nigerian-born Akinbiyi's failure to live up to expectations at Leicester is widely thought to be a contributory factor towards Taylor's sacking this season. The manager's intention was to play him alongside an experienced centre-forward but the plan was wrecked when Stan Collymore left. Nevertheless Akinbiyi finished as top scorer last season, when he hit nine goals in the Premiership. He also scored 21 in 47 games for Bristol City before adding 16 in 36 for Wolves following a \u00a31.2m transfer. Akinbiyi's arrival at Selhurst Park will conclude a fortnight of talks but Francis's quest has been even longer. He first tried to sign him 2 years ago for Birmingham City but he was outbid by Wolves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
