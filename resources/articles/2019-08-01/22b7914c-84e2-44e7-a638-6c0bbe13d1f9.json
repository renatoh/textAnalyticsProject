Abrams announced at a speech in Las Vegas that she would instead lend her platform to a new initiative called Fair Fight 2020, which aims to end voter suppression. \u201cThere are only two things stopping us in 2020: making sure people have a reason to vote and that they have the right to vote,\u201d Abrams told the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades convention, where she made the announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave it to a whole bunch of other folks to make sure they have a reason to vote. I\u2019m here today to announce Fair Fight 2020 to make sure everyone has the right to vote in the United States of America.\u201d Fair Fight 2020 will work with Democratic state parties and local groups across the country to expand voter access to the polls and fight efforts to strip away voting rights before the presidential election next year. The effort will target 20 states, many of them key battlegrounds in the midwest and the south. The initiative is a national extension of Fair Fight 2020, a group Abrams began after narrowly losing in 2018 to Republican Brian Kemp, who served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state during an election plagued by allegations of voter suppression and irregularities. After the election, Abrams, 45, initially refused to concede to Kemp, whom she called the \u201carchitect of voter suppression\u201d in Georgia. As secretary of state, he closed several polling locations in predominantly African American communities and stalled more than 50,000 voter registrations. Since her loss, Abrams\u2019 profile has continued to rise and she has become a heroine on the left. She delivered the Democratic response to the president\u2019s State of the Union Address earlier this year, and the party\u2019s 2020 candidates often make a point to say that Abrams would be governor of Georgia \u2013 and the nation\u2019s first black female governor \u2013 had it not been for intentional voter suppression. This year, she ruled out a run for Senate despite an aggressive effort by national Democrats to draft her into the race against the Republican senator David Perdue. Had she opted to run for president, she would have had to quickly ramp up a campaign and find an opening in a crowded race that has seen candidates with higher profiles struggle to break through. \u201cSomething that seems to anger people when I say it: we won. We won. We won that election,\u201d Abrams said at the convention, as members rose to their feet in applause. \u201cWe changed the face of Georgia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
