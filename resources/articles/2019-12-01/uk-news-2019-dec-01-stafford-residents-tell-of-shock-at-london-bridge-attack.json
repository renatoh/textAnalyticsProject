We didn\u2019t know he existed,\u201d said Canon Michael Neylon, parish priest at Stafford\u2019s St Austin\u2019s Church which neighbours Khan\u2019s flat. He added: \u201cThere are other people that live there as well. But I don\u2019t know anything. We\u2019re just neighbours.\u201d A police cordon remained in place on Sunday evening outside the three-storey block, in Wolverhampton Road, where it is understood Khan was living after being released from prison on licence in December a year ago. The 28-year-old was shot dead by officers on Friday after he launched a frenzied knife attack near London Bridge while wearing a hoax suicide bomb vest. Members of the public tackled him to the ground armed with only a fire extinguisher and whale tusk. Those who died have been named as Cambridge graduates Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23. In the Star and Garter Pub, which sits adjacent to Khan\u2019s flat, staff and customers were tightlipped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t here. I didn\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d a young woman working behind the bar said. But former civil servant Gregg Barton, who lives opposite, believes he had seen Khan before. \u201cBeing in Stafford, there is not an awful lot of Asian people around,\u201d the 37-year-old said. \u201cIt must have been when I was walking into town. He was not somebody I would have usually noticed.\u201d He described the building he lived in as seeming like a \u201chalfway house\u201d where groups of people could often be seen hanging around in the doorway. The manager of a nearby takeaway, who did not wish to be named, said he had spoken to Khan about two weeks ago when he came in to pick up an order. \u201cHe got his food and was having a general chit-chat and then he went. He basically asked: \u2018How long you have been working here?\u2019 And said: \u2018Stafford is a quiet place.\u2019\u201d He said it was \u201cscary\u201d learning of what Khan had done. Another passerby, who works in mental health and also did not wish to be named, told the Guardian Khan used to work out frequently at Elite 2000, a town centre gym opposite Stafford prison. \u201cAll I know is that he was a nice bloke,\u201d said the man, who knows the gym\u2019s owner and whose clients regularly attend the gym. \u201cA few people I know have seen him in the gym. They recognised him and he used to speak to them all. He looked completely different to his photo. His beard was nicer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
