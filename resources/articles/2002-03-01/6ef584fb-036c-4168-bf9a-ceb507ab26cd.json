Anderson stormed out of the office after reading the piece, in which Mr Galloway expresses his reservations about Tony Blair's support of George Bush's war on terror. He is understood to have felt that the article, commissioned by the Spectator editor, Boris Johnson, was at odds with the Spectator's predominantly rightwing stance. \"I do not believe that George Galloway should be writing for the Spectator,\" he told the London Evening Standard, adding: \"I want to be in the magazine more often than I seem to be\". The row mirrors similar political infighting at the New Statesman, the Spectator's left-of-centre counterpart, where the editor, Peter Wilby, has clashed with columnist and former editor John Lloyd over an article backing America's foreign policy. But insiders believe Anderson was irritated at being replaced as political columnist last year. Johnson confirmed that Anderson had left the magazine, but added: \"I'm sure that he will be coming back\". On hearing of Anderson's resignation Mr Galloway - a leftwing MP who has bitterly opposed US sanctions on Iraq - drafted an addendum to the article expressing his sorrow. \"Bruce and I may have our political differences, but we have been friends for 20 years,\" says Mr Galloway of Anderson's resignation. \"Only the other week, at the Cambridge Union, he suggested that the two of us should embark on a roadshow together: he putting the case for the right to assorted housewives and political wonks, and I for the left,\" he writes. \"Alas, perhaps it is now not to be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
