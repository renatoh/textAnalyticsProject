The agreement made public on Tuesday follows a meeting last week between the newly appointed federal education minister, Bill Shorten, and the Tasmanian premier, Lara Giddings. Tasmania joins New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia in agreeing to the new needs-based school funding package, which was the former prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s signature policy reform. Shorten remains in talks with the Victorian and Queensland governments ahead of the passing this weekend of a deadline set by the prime minister, Kevin Rudd, for the states to sign on to the Gonski package. Senior officials in Canberra are hopeful that a deal can be struck with Victoria within that deadline. Shorten has said he does not intend to delay the full introduction of the Gonski package, and the education minister remains in talks with the non-government schools sector. Catholic and independent schools have some concerns about their autonomy in the new system, and about ministerial discretion over future funding allocations. Shorten says he is optimistic those concerns can be addressed. A joint statement from Rudd, Shorten and Giddings released on Tuesday afternoon said: \u201cOver the six years of the new agreement, the Australian and Tasmanian governments will invest more than $380m in extra funding between 2014 and 2019. \u201cTo achieve this, the Australian government has committed to grow its school education spending by 4.7% year from 2014 into 2015 and throughout the agreement. In return, consistent with its 2013-14 budget, Tasmania has agreed to grow its 2015 base funding by 3% to 2016 and will continue to do so every year thereafter.\u201d Giddings said Tasmania was able to sign on to the school reforms having been assured of future goods and services tax distributions from Canberra. Tasmania had been concerned that an agreement on school funding might compromise its future share of the GST. Giddings signalled she also wanted the flexibility to direct the additional funds towards the government sector in the early phase of the program. Giddings said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the quantum of the money, it was how it was applied. We assured the assurances that we need, and that has been a critical step for us.\u201d The Tasmanian premier also paid tribute to the former prime minister for driving the reform program. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Julia, we\u2019d still be around the table arguing,\u201d Giddings said on Tuesday afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
