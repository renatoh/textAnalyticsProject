That said, the 6-4 about Churchill in today\u2019s 2,000 Guineas looks to be for the birds, in view of three of his rivals having shown quite strong form in the past month. Churchill, by contrast, has been absent since October and, while many Guineas winners have followed a similar path, there is a suspicion in this case that precocity accounted for much of Churchill\u2019s achievements last year. His dam, after all, was a speedster whose last win came in the August of her juvenile year. Barney Roy (3.35) was so impressive in winning the Greenham that it is reasonable to believe he might be able to pound his way past the favourite in the last 100 yards. That was only his second start and he showed an enormous stride when asked to win his race in the last quarter-mile. Another furlong and a stronger pace should be excellent news for Richard Hannon\u2019s colt. Al Wukair is worth lots of respect but will need to avoid blowing the start, as he has done more than once. Top Score is an interesting place prospect at huge odds, as it would not be surprising for one of the pacemakers to keep plugging away on this ground. 1.50 Newmarket Lightly raced, Next Stage was free in the early stages here last month, his first outing since June. But he stayed on like a good \u2019un and will surely still be on a beatable mark after only a 6lb rise. Ballet Concerto is the one to fear. 2.05 Goodwood On a sixth start of the year Dubka may have had enough for the time being when disappointing at Bath in October. She had been most progressive to that point and Sir Michael Stoute can be expected to get more out of her this term. She is preferred to Ajman Princess, who looks flattered by her Ribblesdale second. 2.20 Newmarket 2016 was unproductive for Muthmir but he loves a fast surface and might bounce off this ground. He should be much sharper for his Bath reappearance. Profitable might prefer an easier surface but Kachy could be overpriced. 2.40 Goodwood Unlucky when last seen in September and since gelded, Zwayyan should have more to offer this year, having scored twice as a three-year-old. William Haggas\u2019s chestnut is well drawn for this return to action. 2.55 Newmarket This race has no great record of female success but Seventh Heaven looks the standout talent. A fine second to Jack Hobbs in Dubai, she will be better suited by this sounder surface and her win over Found in the Yorkshire Oaks would make her interesting in any company.
