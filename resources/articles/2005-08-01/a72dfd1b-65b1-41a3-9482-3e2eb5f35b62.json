Corry took on the England leadership last season after an injury to Jason Robinson, who in turn had assumed the position because of the various fitness problems dogging Jonny Wilkinson, and though dropped for the last two Tests against the All Blacks this summer, the Leicester back-rower is expected to be heavily involved internationally during the new season. \"It was a tough choice to make because of Martin's England commitments,\" said the Leicester head coach Pat Howard. \"But Martin's a great character, he loves the club and the players, and it's a great challenge for him to replace an icon in world rugby.\" Corry, who has signed a new contract that should keep him at Welford Road for the rest of his career, said he had not hesitated to accept Howard's offer. \"It is a huge honour,\" he said. \"The club is entering a new era with the loss of Johnno and John Wells [Leicester's former head coach], but we are geared up for success.\" Corry is certain to be in England's elite squad when it is announced next week, probably on Monday, with the Rugby Football Union nearing an agreement with the Premiership clubs over the number of release days during a season for players to attend national training sessions. England's head coach Andy Robinson has concerns in a number of positions, not least at scrum-half and in the second row, where, at 32, age and disciplinary problems may have caught up with Danny Grewcock. However, a number of players who missed most or all of last season, notably Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Phil Vickery and Stuart Abbott, should all be involved in the first month of the new Premiership season. The Wasps' centre Abbott, who has not played since breaking a leg in Biarritz in January, makes his comeback in the friendly against Exeter at the Causeway Stadium tomorrow. Abbott's native South Africa face New Zealand in the Tri-nations Series in Cape Town today with their coach Jake White's future said to be under threat even though the Springboks are seeking a record 11th consecutive home win and have won 12 of their 17 Tests under his guidance. SA Rugby's vice-president and former South Africa coach, Andre Markgraaf, is reported to have threatened to sack White, prompting the coach to write a letter to SA Rugby accusing Markgraaf of being aggressive before last week's victory over Australia and telling him to \"toe the line\".
