First, the MPs did not say how much Sir Philip Green, whose reputation was demolished over 59 pages, should pay to cover the shortfall in the BHS pension schemes. It merely said Green \u201chas a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges\u201d. Second, the committees did not recommend that Green should be stripped of his knighthood. Even Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, who had previously raised the prospect of a de-gonging, confined himself to a heavy hint outside the pages of the report. \u201cWhat kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d asked Field. Such relative restraint on the part of the MPs was sensible. It is up to the Pensions Regulator to determine the true size of the shortfall. And it will be the Honours Forfeiture Committee that decides whether SPG, as the tycoon\u2019s hangers-on refer to him, should be plain PG again. But the report provides ammunition by the bucketload for both bodies. In 2000, Green bought a business with a surplus in its pension scheme of \u00a343m and then paid his family dividends far in excess of BHS\u2019s profits. In 2015, having failed to fund the schemes adequately or complete a restructuring to the satisfaction of the regulator, he sold BHS with a \u00a3345m pensions shortfall. The buyer was the \u201cwholly unsuitable\u201d Dominic Chappell, a twice-bankrupt individual who was out of his depth. The verdict on Green is damning and unequivocal. He \u201coverlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless\u201d, says the report. Then he attempted to blame everybody apart from himself. Some of those other actors, especially professional advisers such as Grant Thornton and Olswang, indeed failed in their duties while collecting fees that have still not been disclosed. But the fateful sale of BHS to an incompetent chancer with inadequate funding was driven \u201cpersonally\u201d by Green, says the report. Armed with that conclusion, the Pensions Regulator should press for Green to repair the pension damage in full. It would be a disgrace if even part of the shortfall is covered by the Pension Protection Fund, the lifeboat scheme that is supported by a levy on 6,000 other defined benefit pension schemes. Green \u2013 or, strictly speaking, Lady Green, as the ultimate owner of the family empire \u2013 is rich enough to pay. Let the couple do so rather than shuffle off part of the shortfall on to other companies\u2019 schemes. Estimates of the size of the bill vary. On one accounting measure, the combined shortfall in BHS\u2019s two schemes was \u00a3571m at the point of collapse. A few technical tweaks, such as cash buyouts for members who are decades away from retirement, may be permitted to reduce the cost. But is hard to see how, if the Pensions Regulator is doing its job properly, Green could be asked for less than \u00a3400m. If that feels daunting, even for a billionaire, Green has only himself to blame. The report describes how BHS \u201cdeclined to make the employer contributions necessary to maintain the sustainability of the pension schemes over the duration of Sir Philip Green\u2019s period in charge\u201d. In the early years, trustees\u2019 demands for higher contributions were resisted on the grounds that investing in the business would be more lucrative; then, when BHS faltered, beefier payments were deemed unaffordable. Green let a small pensions shortfall become towering. Whether the correct number is \u00a3400m, \u00a3500m or more, the buck still stops with him. The knighthood question is only slightly trickier. Gongs, in theory, are not meant to depend on the future good behaviour of the recipient, assuming no laws have been broken. In practice, however, the BHS shambles, as with Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, surely falls into the exceptional category. Goodwin\u2019s award for services to banking was impossible to maintain after the bank collapsed. Similarly, Green\u2019s knighthood for services to retailing looks absurd in light of events. The pragmatic compromise in the interests of BHS pensioners is probably this. If Green pays up in full and without further fuss, he can keep his gong. The rest of us will just laugh (again) at the silliness of presenting honours to business people before their careers and character can be judged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
