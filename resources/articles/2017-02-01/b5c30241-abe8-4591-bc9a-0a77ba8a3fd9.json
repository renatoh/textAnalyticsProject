It features a near-future space travel plot with an awful lot of corporate promotional branding from Nasa \u2013 like Ridley Scott\u2019s The Martian but without that movie\u2019s occasional sense of humour. There\u2019s a persistent emo-fetishisation of illness, in the person of a teen visitor from Mars and his romantic infirmity. But it\u2019s not so much The Man Who Fell to Earth as The Fault in Our Stars. Asa Butterfield steps up to his first adult lead as Gardner, whose astronaut mom died giving birth to him 16 years ago, en route to Mars. Since then, he\u2019s been brought up on the Mars station. But he\u2019s got a online relationship with cute Tulsa (Britt Robertson) back on Earth. She\u2019s been in and out of foster homes her whole life; he\u2019s told her he\u2019s confined to home with a rare disease. But soon Gardner gets to come to Earth to see her, despite the health problems caused by the different atmosphere. Earthling authorities such as space travel director Nathaniel Shepherd (Gary Oldman) and his colleague Tom Chen (BD Wong) disapprove of this love, and Gardner is way out of his comfort zone, like a cross between Crocodile Dundee and ET. It\u2019s a wan, anaemic film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
