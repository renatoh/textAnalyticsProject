The former Arsenal keeper has the inside track on Mikel Arteta and will be licking his lips at the chance to show the club they made a mistake in cashing in. Motivation may be totally irrelevant, though, as Arsenal seem to have skewed too heavily toward preventing goals. Yes, conceding two against Manchester City, Leicester and Manchester United is an amazing upgrade but scoring one in that period feels far too meagre for long-term success. Spain\u2019s own George Graham will be unconcerned with stats, though, and focused on driving his side to feed off the victory at Old Trafford.
