Officers from the Catalan force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, were reported to have fired teargas and run over two protesters during clashes that quickly spread after a earlier demonstration turned into a series of running battles with police. Police claimed that projectiles had been fired at helicopters. Roger Torrent, the speaker of the Catalan parliament, condemned the violence, tweeting: \u201cThese actions don\u2019t represent us. We must distance ourselves from violent behaviour.\u201d As television news broadcast footage of blazing barricades and protesters hurling projectiles at riot police, Spain\u2019s prime minister warned that his government will not be provoked into overreacting. In a televised address, Pedro S\u00e1nchez called on the pro-independence Catalan president, Quim Torra, to unequivocally condemn the use of violence. Referring to the regional government\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to secure independence, S\u00e1nchez added: \u201cNo leader can camouflage their failure behind curtains of smoke and fire.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said the government would defend Spain\u2019s constitution and peaceful coexistence but would not be tempted into inflaming tensions. \u201cThe state will always guarantee the rights of those who wish to protest their ideas peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut organised violent groups and those who try to break democratic laws will not achieve their aims \u2026 The only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become over-excited and divided. They want us to fall for their provocations and feed a violent spiral.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s address came as tens of thousands of people gathered in central Barcelona to protest against the supreme court\u2019s verdict. Many threw toilet rolls in the air in a nod to the demonstration\u2019s slogan: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shit to clear up.\u201d Protestors were mostly young and seemed ready to confront police. Chanting \u201coppressors out\u201d and \u201cthe streets will alway be ours\u201d, they taunted riot officers and cheered when masked demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins. The mood was angry and not, as politicians claimed, confined to a handful bent on violence. At a signal from Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, the social network that is guiding demonstrators, the crowd dispersed to gather outside the headquarters of a Spanish government department. After confrontations with police they headed back towards the city centre, setting fire to barricades. Earlier on Wednesday, the nine jailed leaders had issued a joint plea for peaceful protests after the Spanish government warned any further violence would be met with a \u201cfirm, proportional and united\u201d response. The nine called for a huge but peaceful response to their imprisonment. \u201cAll support to mobilisations and massive and peaceful marches,\u201d wrote the nine, who include the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras and two influential grassroots leaders, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart. \u201cNo violence represents us.\u201d On Tuesday, peaceful demonstrations in Barcelona gave way to running battles with the police, 24 hours after thousands of pro-independence protesters attempted to shut down Barcelona airport, leading to police charges. The Spanish government said 51 people had been arrested across Catalonia on Monday and Tuesday, and 54 officers from the regional police force and 18 from the national force had been injured. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rightwing opponents are calling for the government to take a hard line on the latest eruption of the regional independence crisis. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November. The latest unrest began on Monday after Spain\u2019s supreme court acquitted the nine defendants of the charge of violent rebellion but convicted them variously of sedition, misuse of public funds and disobedience over their parts in the push to secede from Spain. Junqueras was jailed for 13 years, while S\u00e0nchez and Cuixart received nine-year sentences. The six others were given terms of between 10 and a half and 12 years. Hours after the verdicts were announced, an international arrest warrant was reissued for the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who spearheaded the push for independence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
