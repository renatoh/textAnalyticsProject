Taking it back to the shop isn't an option, so how can I get it to work? I had the same problem, and thought I'd broken some internal electronics. It turned out to be a far simpler issue: the charging dock had broken. New shuffle docks are notoriously ropey, so test your iPod on another one. A replacement will cost around \u00a320. I want a portable reader, but when I tried to buy one online, I was told they ship only to the US. Any ideas? The idea of reading a book digitally might seem heresy to bibliophiles, but eBook readers are getting better all the time. The Sony PRS-500 Reader is one of the most popular, but if you can't get one from the US, try eBay, where they go for around \u00a3150. Buying books can be tricky, though, since Sony's book store accepts only US credit cards. Another, more expensive option is the iRex Iliad (around \u00a3450). It has a touchscreen and built-in wifi - Libresco is its British distributor (iliadreader.co.uk). Some people swear by using their phones, which might be a cheaper option, but you'd probably prefer one with a big screen, a Palm Treo or iPhone, say. \u00b7 Email your problems to gadget.clinic@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
