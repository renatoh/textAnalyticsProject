In lockdown, you might have decided now is the time. If so, you are not alone: paint companies are still delivering and sales are brisk. But is this really the time to embark on such a project? And can you make a success of it, even if you have never done it before? We asked the experts the best way to go about it. Before you start The good news is, you can save a lot of money by painting your own home, because labour accounts for the majority of decorating costs. The bad news is, there\u2019s a reason painters are expensive. Painting is difficult. The biggest mistake first-timers make is thinking too big, according to Joa Studholme, author of How to Decorate and colour curator for the paint company Farrow &amp; Ball. \u201cMy main piece of advice is to start small,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have a small hall, that can be a good place to start. There you can indulge your fantasies of doing something quite strong and bold, which might be something you\u2019re feeling you want to do right now, but then you don\u2019t have to look at it all day.\u201d Painting a whole room will certainly keep you busy, but if you are new to it, you probably won\u2019t find it terribly therapeutic. \u201cI do it where I think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gonna paint this, and it\u2019s gonna be really soothing,\u2019\u201d says Studholme, \u201cAnd, actually, painting is stressful. Smaller things are much better to do.\u201d For beginners, she suggests starting with your front door, or the legs of a table. \u201cPaint the inside of a cupboard in a jolly colour and that will make you smile every time you open it,\u201d she says. When you have some idea of what it entails, you can move on to a room. Choosing colours Lockdown may seem like fertile ground for ill-advised decisions, but Edward Bulmer, an interior designer and head of the Edward Bulmer Natural Paint company, says there may never be a better time to pick colours. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not often that we can contemplate our rooms at all times of day,\u201d he says, \u201cand in varying weathers, and probably with full-on use, if you\u2019ve got your family around.\u201d You can still order sample pots from many companies, including Bulmer\u2019s and Farrow &amp; Ball (delivery times may be a bit longer, but none of us is going anywhere). Instead of applying it to the wall, paint a generous piece of card \u2013 A5 or larger \u2013 or a bit of old wallpaper. \u201cThen place it against the wall round the room and look at it in different lights,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cYou might feel like a right idiot doing it, but that\u2019s the best way to gauge how it\u2019s going to look.\u201d If you don\u2019t know where to begin, try being led by the colours of other surfaces in the room: floors, worktops, tiles, any large bits of furniture. \u201cSome decision that\u2019s already out of your hands,\u201d says Bulmer. Work with what you\u2019ve got. Tools and supplies At the minimum you will need a scraper, masking tape, some sandpaper, filler, ample dust sheets, a decent brush or two, and a roller and tray. \u201cWe advise a medium pile roller, not a foam roller,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cIt will help the paint lay a bit more like it would with a brush.\u201d As for paint, the amount you need varies depending on the type, but five litres of emulsion will cover around 60 square metres. Emulsion is for walls and ceilings; eggshell for woodwork. Cheap paint is probably a false economy, because it won\u2019t go as far. \u201cOne of the expensive ingredients in paint is titanium dioxide, the basic white pigment,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cNormally, to make a paint cheaper you use less of that, so you\u2019ll have less coverage.\u201d Getting ready \u201cPreparation is everything,\u201d says Studholme. Professional painters spend far longer prepping a room than they do painting it. Push all the furniture into the middle of the room and cover it with dust sheets. Scrape away any loose old paint. Fill cracks and nail holes, and sand flat. Sand to create a key (an adhesive surface) for the new paint. Mask the edges of carpet. Apply primer to your walls, and don\u2019t worry too much what it looks like; it\u2019s just there to provide a stable painting surface. The ceiling If you are doing the ceiling, that should be done first; you can get up there with either a ladder or a roller on a pole. Beforehand, paint round the edges where the ceiling meets the wall or any architectural features, using a small brush. You can mask the edges with tape if you are unsure of yourself. Then roll. Expect to come away heavily speckled. The walls Start by \u201ccutting in\u201d the top edge where the wall meets the ceiling, carefully, with a brush, by eye. Do the same along any woodwork edges (you can be a bit less precise here, because you are painting the woodwork later). If this part sounds daunting, Studholme has a simple solution that also happens to be fashionable: paint everything \u2013 walls, ceilings, woodwork \u2013 the same colour. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier for home decorating and it makes the room look bigger,\u201d she says. It\u2019s by no means a radical idea. \u201cThere\u2019s historic precedent for it. Georgian rooms were often painted in one colour.\u201d When it comes to rolling your walls, the main advice is to keep going. \u201cThat\u2019s the single pitfall, really,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cModern emulsion is lovely and quick-drying, but it also means that what you have to do is start, and carry on. Not start, stop, take a phone call and have a cup of coffee.\u201d A stop-start approach yields a streaky finish. Paint a single coat in one go, and let it dry overnight. Two coats should be sufficient in most cases. Woodwork This is where real care is required: painting windows, door frames and skirting boards with nice straight edges and without getting any drips or splatters on your freshly painted walls. Not once but three times, because you will need primer plus two top coats. It\u2019s fiddly, but there is still an opportunity for some creativity here. \u201cOne trick is to paint the spindles of your stair balustrade dark,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThat\u2019s quite laborious, but it\u2019s quite a fun thing to do, and it makes a huge difference. It creates this satisfying dark core, a backbone through your house.\u201d Floors \u201cI love a painted floor,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThe rule with painted floors is that they always look much lighter than you expect. Nobody realises how much light bounces on to a floor. If you paint a floor light, it will bounce light all round your room.\u201d It\u2019s also just about the cheapest way to cover a floor there is. You will need a robust, hard-wearing paint. There are specialist floor paints, and some experts even recommend boat paint. It is a big undertaking \u2013 you need to completely empty the room \u2013 but is not that technically challenging. \u201cPainting floors is easy,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cGravity helps. Having said that, you do need to let them cure for a few days before you walk on them.\u201d If you are stuck in two rooms during the lockdown, now might not be the time to restrict yourself to one. You also need to think about what part of the room you are going to end up in when you finish, or you might literally paint yourself into a corner. Radiators The factory finish of a modern radiator does not need to be painted but if it is obtrusive, you might want to hide it. In that case, a light sanding and an oil undercoat, followed by \u201cthe eggshell version of the wall\u201d should suffice, says Bulmer. There is such a thing as radiator paint, but it might not come in the colour you need. The radiator should be cold when you paint it and will need to remain off for 24 hours afterwards, so the weather forecast might be a consideration. Finishing up Once you have completed the project, Studholme suggests you make a record of all the colours and finishes you have used in case you need to repaint any bits later. Store leftover paint in a cool, dry, frost-free place, ready for touching-up or any other little projects. \u201cLast night, I got on a ladder and painted a square round the mirror above our fireplace,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it might be nice to have a little bit of colour there. It took me probably eight minutes to do it, and I can paint it out again tomorrow if I don\u2019t like it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
