HMRC is pursuing providers for six years of wages after the government reversed its decision that \u201csleep-in support\u201d \u2013 where carers are present overnight but rarely called upon \u2013 is exempt from minimum pay legislation. It means all organisations \u2013 from Mencap at one end of the scale to family-led businesses at the other, which together provide sleep-in support care for 178,000 people with learning disabilities \u2013 are at risk of insolvency, the charity says. Enforcement action to claim the money deemed to be owed was stayed in July after pleas from providers, but it is due to resume on 2 October. Mencap says the sector will be thrown into chaos if that happens without a government commitment to cover the back-pay bill. Derek Lewis, the charity\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThere would be, for a substantial period of time, chaos in the sector and the people who would suffer are people with learning disabilities, their families who would be subjected to great stress and the staff who care for them, many of whom would become redundant.\u201d Sleep-in support allows people with learning disabilities to live in their own homes and communities. Recent research suggested that 99.7% of sleep-ins are spent asleep. When the national minimum wage \u2013 since replaced by the \u201cnational living wage\u201d for workers over 24 \u2013 was introduced in 1999, time spent asleep by care workers in such circumstances was exempted in government guidance. Instead workers were paid a flat on-call allowance, only being paid the minimum wage if their services were required during night. But after two individuals won employment tribunals claiming they were entitled to the minimum wage for the entire night, the government changed its advice saying the legislation did apply to sleep-in support. Such care is commissioned and paid for by local authorities but HMRC has gone after the providers for the back payments with councils unwilling to foot the bill. Mencap, one of the largest providers of sleep-in care, says it faces a \u00a320m bill for the past six years, which will exhaust its reserves of \u00a319.6m. \u201cFunding back pay would require highly damaging actions to sell assets, cut programmes and cancel investment,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cOur plans to improve the lives of those with learning disabilities could be set back by a decade or more, as we struggle to repair the financial damage that would be caused by this liability.\u201d He said most of the reserves come from donors who did not envisage their money being used for such a purpose and would likely be put off giving in the future. Mencap\u2019s chief executive, Jan Tregelles, described it as \u201cthe worst crisis in our 70 years\u201d and warned that it was the NHS \u201calready about to face one of its toughest winters, that will have to pick-up the pieces\u201d. Celebrities including Jodie Whittaker, Joanna Lumley and Kit Harrington have joined the charity\u2019s campaign for the government to intervene. Research suggests the cost to the sector could total \u00a3400m. Smaller providers that are not incorporated could even face having to make back payments out of their own pockets. Many are unwilling to speak openly for fear of drawing HMRC\u2019s attention. One chief executive of a medium-sized provider in the West Midlands, said the organisation employs 300 people, delivering 1,100 hours of support and 27 sleep-ins every day. He estimates its back-pay liability to be \u00a31.5m compared with reserves of \u00a31.4m, which include two care homes. \u201cWe would have to stop trading straight away, our contracts with local authorities would be toxic,\u201d he said. A Department of Health spokesman referred the Guardian to a previous statement by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which said the government has \u201cworked closely with the sector in response to concerns\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
