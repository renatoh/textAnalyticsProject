The Durham fast bowler seems unlikely to recover in time from back and knee problems. England had estimated that Onions would be out for three months due to a stress reaction in his back, suffered last winter. That would have left him the final month of the county season in which to prove his fitness. But a knee cartilage problem, for which he had surgery that at the time was largely underplayed, is more serious than England first admitted. Micro-fracture surgery offers the prospect of a better recovery in the long term, but its rehabilitation period is long. It takes on average four months for cartilage to redevelop. This makes it highly unlikely that Onions will be able to prove his fitness in time for the Ashes. England would only gamble on Onions's fitness in the Ashes, without a good stint of county bowling, if injuries to other fast bowlers were to force their hand. If everybody stays fit Onions, at his expected rate of progress, would be overlooked in favour of James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Tim Bresnan, Ajmal Shahzad and Ryan Sidebottom. That Onions's fitness would be questionable on two fronts would concern the selectors and senior coaching staff. Mentally, they have ruled him out of this summer's four-Test series against Pakistan, which starts at Lord's on 13 July. Onions, who has taken 28 wickets at 31.03 in eight Tests, but who has not played for England since the Cape Town Test against South Africa in January, left the subsequent Bangladesh tour early after what had been seen as a minor back complaint was found to be more serious. Last month, Onions refused to rule out his chances of an Ashes trip to Australia, saying: \"All I can do is be patient, work hard on my rehabilitation programme and focus on my No1 goal, which is to be fully fit and available for selection for the Ashes tour.\" He is likely to remain bullish when he appears at an npower Urban Cricket day at Nottingham racecourse on Wednesday, when more than 2,000 children will attempt to set a new world record for the largest game of mass cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
