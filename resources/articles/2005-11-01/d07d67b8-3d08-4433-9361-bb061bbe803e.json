Finally confirmed as Germany's first female chancellor just 48 hours ago, more than two months after the country's general election, Ms Merkel said she wanted to maintain \"good, friendly relations\" with Britain. But with time running out for Mr Blair to put forward a possible solution to deadlocked talks on the EU's 2007-13 budget, Ms Merkel told reporters only \"we will see\" if a deal could be done at next month's final UK-hosted summit. The two leaders met in Downing Street. Ms Merkel has already visited Paris, traditionally seen as Germany's strongest ally in Europe, and Brussels. With a 2002 deal between the French and Germans already guaranteeing support for current farm subsidies until at least 2013, and with Britain under fire for its unique, 20-year-old rebate, Ms Merkel played her cards close to her chest. Though she is thought to back Britain's call for some sort of reduction in farm subsidies, she is also believed to object to the \u00a33bn-a-year rebate, first negotiated by the woman she is so often compared to: Margaret Thatcher. Ms Merkel told reporters: \"With this visit, I want to underline that Germany and the new German federal government has a great interest in maintaining good, friendly relations with France, but not just with France - particularly with the UK.\" Pressed on whether she would support French demands for Britain to give up its rebate in order to secure a deal on a new EU budget, she refused to come down on one side or the other. \"I want to have success, and the situation of each country has to be taken into account. If anybody forgets one country with its interests, you won't get any success,\" she said. She also refused to speculate about the prospects for a deal at next month's summit in Brussels under the British presidency. \"I don't really want to look into the crystal ball,\" she said. \"We have three weeks left. Everybody will want to make their contribution, and then we will see.\" For his part, Mr Blair said that he looked forward to developing a \"very good and close working relationship\" with the new German chancellor. He said Britain remained committed to trying to secure a deal on the budget at the December summit but acknowledged that it would not be easy. \"Obviously, it is going to be difficult and tough, but we will do our level best to try to get an agreement,\" he said. However, major disagreements between the two remain, most notably over the British EU rebate and Turkey's entry to the EU - both of which Ms Merkel opposes. The two are due to give a joint press conference in Downing Street at around 4pm. The new chancellor's visit to London today comes after she has already stopped in on Paris - traditionally Berlin's closest partner in Europe - and Brussels. With the UK currently holding the rotating EU presidency, Mr Blair is hopeful that he can persuade Ms Merkel of the need for reform of the common agricultural policy, which heavily subsidises French and German farmers. The CAP is currently fixed until at least 2013, despite the accession of 10 largely poorer nations to the union last year. Speaking in Paris yesterday Mrs Merkel reassured France that it was still Germany's key ally in Europe. However, she also said the time had come to heal the rift with the Bush administration over the Iraq war, which both France and Germany opposed. \"I believe the ties between the US and Germany can be developed further,\" she said. However, she has pledged she will not reverse the decision to keep German troops out of Iraq. She is also thought to be less keen on Mr Schr\u00f6der's close relationship with president Putin of Russia. The new chancellor yesterday refused to be drawn on budget proposals drafted by the UK as the holder of the EU presidency. Earlier, Mr Blair held talks with the Polish prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, who told journalists that the new EU members had written a joint letter calling for an urgent resolution to the wrangling over the union's budget. In what appeared to be a message directed at Britain and France - whose arguments over CAP reform and the UK's rebate have delayed a deal - Mr Marcinkiewicz called for EU members to overcome \"selfishness\" and display \"solidarity\". \"All countries are interested in the matter of the budget but the new member countries of the European Union are particularly interested because each euro that reaches them is devoted to development, to economic growth,\" he said. \"I also spoke today about solidarity which is capable of overcoming any selfishness,\" he added. Mr Blair said he was aiming to strike a deal on the budget for 2007-13 before the UK's presidency ends at the end of December. \"We want to do that but it has got to be one that is right for all countries ... but also one that Europe can afford. \"I've made it clear throughout that I understand entirely why the accession countries in particular need the budget certainty to be able to plan ahead. The prime minister obviously made that point to me very strongly now.\" Asked whether Britain was willing to give up its \u00a33bn a year rebate in order to secure a deal, Mr Blair said: \"The rebate is in existence because of the problems to do with what would otherwise be quite an unfair distribution of payments. \"Over the past two financial perspectives, Britain has been a massive net contributor to the EU budget. We have championed enlargement, we will pay our share towards enlargement ... but it's got to be on the basis of an overall settlement that is fair.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
