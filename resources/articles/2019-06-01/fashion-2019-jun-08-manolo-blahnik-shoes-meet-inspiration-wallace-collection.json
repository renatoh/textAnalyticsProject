But a new exhibition is to present his creations in a way they haven\u2019t been seen before. An Enquiring Mind: Manolo Blahnik at the Wallace Collection opens in London on Monday and will pair the most famous shoes from his archive with world-renowned paintings in the gallery\u2019s 18th century rooms. Highlighting the aesthetic shared between the collection\u2019s baroque masterpieces and Blahnik\u2019s own decadent craftsmanship, the exhibition aims to create a dialogue between art and craft. In one room, the shoes Blahnik designed for Sofia Coppola\u2019s 2006 film Marie Antoinette are placed in front of Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s 1767 painting The Swing, while in another Frans Hals\u2019s 1624 portrait of The Laughing Cavalier will be juxtaposed with a pair of ornate black boots. In total, 10 rooms will be adorned with more than 160 pairs of shoes, each exploring a theme in Blahnik\u2019s work, which has been heavily inspired by art and the Wallace Collection in particular. \u201cI have been coming here for over 49 years. I\u2019ve always been mad for little bows, ribbons and satins,\u201d says 76-year-old Blahnik of the shoes and clothes depicted in oil. His collaboration with the Wallace Collection marks the first time that the venue has allowed its permanent collection to be interrupted by another designer\u2019s work. \u201cTo start with, I felt a little embarrassed to be around these types of beautiful things and then I thought: \u2018Why not [do something] that brings a connection between a piece of silk and a piece of art?\u2019 I think it is important to see where something came from.\u201d The exhibition will culminate in the Great Gallery, which houses a selection of masterpieces \u2013 including works by Titian and Vel\u00e1zquez. The director of the Wallace Collection, Dr Xavier Bray, who co-curated the exhibition, hopes that it will make the collection \u2013 which is free to visit \u2013 more widely known. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that the Wallace is here. It\u2019s underappreciated. That\u2019s why something like Manolo [is great].\u201d The exhibition comes shortly after the milliner Stephen Jones\u2019 exhibition at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton this year, which saw his fashion creations adorn furniture in every room of the landmark and attracted droves of visitors to admire the splendour of King George IV\u2019s famous pleasure palace. Blahnik, who celebrates the 50th anniversary of his eponymous brand next year, hopes his historical collaboration will entice \u201ccurious millennials\u201d to the collection. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful moment to do it.\u201d An Enquiring Mind: Manolo Blahnik at the Wallace Collection, London, from 10 June until 1 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
