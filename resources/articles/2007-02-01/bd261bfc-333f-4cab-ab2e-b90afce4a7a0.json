Giselle Pakeerah's 14-year-old son, Stefan, was stabbed and beaten to death by Warren Leblanc on February 25 2004. Although there was no evidence that Manhunt inspired the attack, the boy's parents believe its brutality was provoked by his killer having played the game. Mrs Pakeerah said yesterday: \"I just think it shows how morally irresponsible the industry is. It's abominable timing. It's a very difficult time for me and to have this in the same month is a bit of an insult to Stefan's memory.\" Mrs Pakeerah has campaigned against violent computer games since her son's murder. Some shops withdrew the 18-certificate game, made by Rockstar, from sale after Stefan's killing and it was banned in countries such as New Zealand. Leicester East MP Keith Vaz, who has backed the Pakeerahs' call for curbs on violent games, told the Leicester Mercury: \"It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games.\" The original game depicts players hunted down and attacked for the amusement of a rich madman. Players defend themselves with meat cleavers and hammers. LeBlanc, who was 17 at the time, lured the younger boy to a park near Leicester, where he inflicted terrible injuries with a knife and claw hammer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
