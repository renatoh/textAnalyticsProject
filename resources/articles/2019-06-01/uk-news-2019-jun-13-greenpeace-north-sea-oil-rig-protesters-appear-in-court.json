The two men aged 50 and 40 were taken off the Transocean rig after police landed specialist officers on its helideck on Thursday afternoon, before lowering the rig closer to the surface of the water. Police Scotland said nine Greenpeace activists had now been arrested, including three who have now appeared in court charged with disorderly conduct. The group first occupied the Paul B Loyd Jr rig as it left the Cromarty Firth on Sunday night before unfurling a banner warning of a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d from a gantry around one leg of the 27,000-tonne platform. There had been a rotation of activists but all have now been taken off the rig. Ch Supt George Macdonald, the local commander, said: \u201cThe particular nature of this protest on an oil platform within a marine environment made this an extremely complex and challenging operation. \u201cPolice Scotland fully understand the rights and privileges of peaceful protests, however, there is a balance when such actions are potentially reckless and compromise safety. We also have a duty to act where criminality is suspected or identified.\u201d The two men are likely to appear in court on Friday. Greenpeace has accused BP, which is sending the rig to the Vorlich field where it hopes to extract 30 million barrels of oil, of hypocrisy by insisting it believes in tackling the climate crisis while at the same time maximising production from its oil and gas fields. In a statement BP accused the protestors of a dangerous PR stunt. \u201cBP supports discussion, debate and peaceful demonstration, but the irresponsible actions of Greenpeace put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe share the protestors\u2019 concerns about climate change, we support the Paris agreement [to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C] and are committed to playing our part to advance the energy transition. \u201cHowever, progress to a lower carbon future will depend on coming together, understanding each other\u2019s perspectives and working to find solutions, not dangerous PR stunts that exacerbate divisions and create risks to both life and property.\u201d John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, accused BP of misdirecting its energies. \u201cOur activists have blocked BP\u2019s rig for five long days, braving the rain and the cold, to stop this oil giant from fuelling the climate emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cBP is hell-bent on drilling for more climate-wrecking oil, and we\u2019re hellbent on stopping them. If this company put half as much effort into shifting their business towards renewables and tackling the climate emergency, we\u2019d be much closer to solving it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
