An enlarged group would be well placed to take advantage of the deregulation set out this year in the Gambling Act. The government is shortly to appoint a panel to consider licence applications for a new generation of 17 larger casinos, including one resort-style casino, which have been sanctioned under the act. The 17 sites will house more than 3,000 lucrative casino slot machines - about double the number in casinos now. Operators, including Gala, are believed to be drawing up plans to turn these sites into one-stop-shops for punters, with horseracing and other sports bets as well as bingo. Folding the Coral brand into the Gala empire would strengthen the group's hopes of winning contracts for the new generation sites. A source familiar with the talks said Coral, Britain's third-largest betting shop chain, was progressing \"full steam ahead\" with flotation plans, despite the Gala approach. Last month Coral, which is backed by private equity group Charterhouse, announced it had appointed Lehman Brothers to draw up flotation proposals. It will continue to pursue a \u00a3800m market valuation if talks with Gala prove fruitless. Coral and Gala have been among the most successful private equity sector investments in recent years and have transformed the fortunes of the two management teams, led by Vaughn Ashdown and John Kelly respectively. Coral management's 16% stake, dominated by Mr Ashdown and finance director Mick Mariscotti, is expected to be valued at \u00a3128m if Coral floats, more if Gala takes over. Mr Kelly is thought to have accrued \u00a320m in cash and shares. With his management team, he controls 10% of Gala."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
