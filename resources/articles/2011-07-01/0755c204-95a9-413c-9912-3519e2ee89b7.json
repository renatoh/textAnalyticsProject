The funding, which will provide 11% of the body's resources in the first year, will make Britain the second most generous donor to UNWomen \u2014 although it is considerably less than the \u00a321m a year requested by the Gender and Development Network. Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, will announce the funding in the wake of last week's publication of a new strategic plan by UNWomen. Britain believes that Bachelet has taken a firm grip of the new body and has been impressed by a series of goals. These include: \u2022 Helping 15 countries introduce domestic violence legislation. \u2022 Supporting efforts to ensure that women participate in decision making in 25 countries. The UK has faced criticism for its delay in announcing whether it would support Bachelet. But sources at the Department for International Development, who pointed out that it provided \u00a31m in start-up funding, said that Britain wanted to carry out a rigorous assessment of Bachelet's plans after doubts about the work of the former UN gender organisation, UNIFEM, which received \u00a33m from Britain. Britain is providing 11% of UNWomen's resources in the first year and 9% in the second. There will be a review after two years. Spain, the largest donor, is giving $23m (\u00a314.3m) a year. \"Michelle Bachelet has made an impressive start,\" one government source said. \"[The organisation's predecessor] did not have enough political momentum. Bachelet is providing high-level momentum.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
