If he succeeds in landing the specially-built Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer jet aircraft back in Kansas 80 hours later, Fossett will have notched up another record to add to the 62 he already holds. However, his adventurer's pedigree does not mean he is immune to a spot of pre-flight nerves. Fossett, 60, was the first person to circle the globe solo in a hot-air balloon, confessed to a press conference last night: \"I suppose I am a bit of a nervous person. Perhaps it's justified in this case.\" GlobalFlyer's 19,863 nautical mile, 285mph white-knuckle ride begins at an airfield in the town of Salina, Kansas at roughly 5pm local time (2300 GMT) today. After weeks of delays waiting for conditions to be exactly right, project manager Paul Moore said: \"We are increasingly confident that we will be taking off this afternoon. GlobalFlyer is now at the end of the runway.\" As the US magazine Popular Science put it unromantically last year, \"If things do not go well, Fossett's flight will end in a horrific fireball during the incredibly dangerous takeoff of the fuel-pregnant, exquisitely stressed aircraft.\" GlobalFlyer's giant 35metre wingspan and aerodynamic design dreamed up by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites aircraft factory should help it harness the jet streams that will help it on its way around the globe in record time. The plane cost $1.5m to design and build. It is constructed from extremely light yet strong materials designed to enable it to carry the huge fuel payload needed to propel it around the globe. The fuel will make up 86% of its weight on takeoff. Fossett's personal rocket fuel will be diet milkshakes, his only sustenance during the flight. His greatest challenge will be staying awake for hour after hour, keeping the aircraft on track at a maximum altitude of 45,000ft. If he does fall asleep at the controls, staff at mission control at Kansas State University, Salina, and on the chase plane that will accompany GlobalFlyer for portions of the flight will be there to wake him up. A sophisticated Nasa onboard communication system will keep Fossett in constant touch and allow him to conduct interviews with the 160-strong international press corps that has descended on the town of Salina (population 45,000). Branson is confident that Fossett, his partner for several around the world balloon exploits, is up to the job. \"It's the greatest of aviation adventures by the world's greatest adventurer,\" he said. The millionaire Virgin chairman has offered Fossett free flights for life on Virgin Atlantic if he succeeds. He has lent him his Breitling watch - featuring a special emergency locator beacon in case of emergency - for the duration of the flight. \"I want it back afterwards\", he joked. When questioned about the reason for the attempt, Sir Richard said: \"Mankind strives to improve on what he has knows. So first of all this is a challenge to see whether it's possible to fly around the world by himself without refuelling. If mankind hadn't pushed themselves to climb mountains or if the Wright brothers hadn't taken the risk of flying originally Virgin Atlantic and other airliners wouldn't be here\". The first solo round-the-world trip, a seven-day, multi-stop voyage, was undertaken by Wiley Post in 1933. The first nonstop global flight without refuelling was made in 1986 by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan, the brother of the GlobalFlyer designer Burt. Rutan's Scaled Composites is also developing on SpaceShipOne, the craft in which Sir Richard hopes to become the first space tourist and to launch Virgin Atlantic passengers into space. Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which is sponsoring the record attempt, has brought a media circus to a community not used to being in the spotlight. Journalists and photographers have packed out the local Holiday Inn, where they were greeted with applause from hotel staff when they arrived last night. Salina mayor Monte Shadwick presented Branson and Fossett with the keys to the city at a ceremony last night, admitting that they \"don't really open very much in Salina, maybe a bottle of beer\". \"Salina's place in aviation history will forever be there and for that we are eternally grateful,\" he said. The Kansas state motto is \"to the stars through difficulty\": a successful takeoff this afternoon could make that a fitting maxim for Fossett's endeavour. \u00b7 Follow the GlobalFlyer mission as it happens with Jane Perrone on Guardian Unlimited Newsblog"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
