On most public outings he is linking national security with border security and \u201ceconomic security\u201d, which apparently can be best attained by supporting his budget. In question time on Tuesday, Abbott declared: \u201cYou can't trust Labor with national security and you can't trust Labor with our nation's economy.\u201d On Thursday he was asked: \u201cPrime Minister, in question time a couple of days ago, you said Labor could not be trusted with national security. Was that a reference to border protection or something broader?\u201d He answered: \u201cLook, principally, border protection, but if you do look at Labor's record on defence spending, for instance, I think there was a $25bn cut \u2026 and if anything, the events of the last week or so in Iraq have reminded us that this is an uncertain and rather dangerous world and it's important that we maintain our preparedness and our capability \u2026 and that's certainly what this government will do.\u201d By Friday he was linking the need to prevent Australians who have left to join jihadi fighters in Syria or Iraq from re-entering the country with the policy of \u201cstopping the boats\u201d. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country,\u201d Abbott told 2GB. \u201cSo that is the absolute determination of the Australian government. We will keep our borders secure, not just from illegal boats but from returning jihadis as well.\u201d He did add: \u201cLet\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due \u2014 I think that Bill Shorten is just as keen as I am to ensure that when it comes to protecting our country against this type of thing.\u201d But he returned to tie up the other \u201csecurity\u201d later in the same interview, saying the government was \u201cdedicated to national security and to economic security \u2026 because this is an uncertain world, sometimes the dangerous world, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that our national security partnerships are in good shape and we are constantly looking for more opportunities \u2026 to strengthen our economy\u201d. There\u2019s an obvious temptation here. In the 2001 \u201cTampa election\u201d, the issue of \u201cborder security\u201d was conflated with national security post-September 11 with the suggestion that terrorists could slip into Australia on asylum boats. And the issue got the struggling second-term Howard government out of a whole lot of political trouble. More possible hurdles in the government\u2019s crash-through-or-crash strategy The government has been charging at its critics as if it might knock their pesky arguments over by the brute force of rhetorical repetition \u2013 it has not broken any election promises, it has not cut health or education funding or pensions either and its budget is not unfair or lacking in compassion it says, over and over. \u201cFor people to suggest somehow that we are without compassion or that we are trying to be mean for the sake of being mean, it\u2019s just reprehensible,\u2019\u2019 treasurer Joe Hockey told the AFR\u2019s Tony Walker. \u201cIt\u2019s like suggesting a parent that denies their child extra chocolate is somehow being cruel and mean where in fact what we\u2019re trying to do is ensure that every Australian has a reasonable quality of life with a sustainable future.\u2019\u2019 But this Senate, and the one about to take over in July, appear to think many budget measures are a bit more essential than that extra square of choccie, and don\u2019t seem likely to be easily persuaded otherwise. Palmer (who probably read the reports that the government\u2019s strategy was to \u201cpick off\u201d his senators one by one \u2013 why would they telegraph that?) says he\u2019s going to make a big announcement on Wednesday about how his three senators intend to vote on a whole lot of things, right before his first face-to-face meeting with Abbott on Thursday. But spokesmen for Motoring Enthusiast senator-elect Ricky Muir, say he won\u2019t necessarily be voting with PUP, as had been widely assumed, adding yet another unpredictable element to the proceedings. And with opinion polls showing the government\u2019s two-party preferred vote languishing at 47% and support for independents and \u2018others\u2019 climbing, the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option of a double dissolution is also not looking attractive from the Coalition\u2019s perspective. The departure of moderate Sue Boyce, keeping it real Perspective from a different vantage point was offered up from one of the Coalition\u2019s departing soldiers. Politics is so chock-full of talking points and formulations that truth and raw humanity is, increasingly, a rationed commodity. Liberal senator Sue Boyce said farewell to politics this week in typically candid style. In her valedictory speech Wednesday evening, the feminist and Liberal moderate reminded us that she\u2019d crossed the floor \u2013 once on carbon pricing and twice on marriage equality. That\u2019s already known. What was unknown was how it might have felt to disappoint your close colleagues \u2013 people you respect and care about \u2013 in a sectarian and tribal place like Canberra. It felt lonely, she said, to step outside the group. \u201cI was not prepared for how I felt when it came to actually physically crossing the floor. It is lonely; and, no matter how strong your conviction in the correctness of your stance, there is a small part of you that feels disloyal to your colleagues, to your party and to the fragile fabric that unites us,\u201d Boyce said. There was more humanity to share \u2013 a singular habit of bringing her handbag into the chamber in a world where blokes travel light and stuff pagers in their suit pockets. She wondered how a handbag could possibly be remarkable, and yet it was. \u201cAre we getting some sort of an echo of some of the issues that perhaps need modernising around here?\u201d Considered words, also, for the colleagues she was leaving behind. \u201cIn the past few months I have been asked numerous times if, as a moderate and a feminist, I am concerned about our party's perceived move to the right. Yes, I am concerned \u2013 but I am also hopeful. I am hopeful that debates about important issues such as same-sex marriage and responses to climate change will continue to be conducted robustly, but respectfully, within our party. I also expect that pragmatism will ultimately triumph. Australians will continue to elect governments of the centre right \u2013 and, hopefully less often, of the centre left \u2013 so any general move too far to the right would make us unelectable.\u201d The revelation that Bill Shorten can absolutely nail a joke \u2026 But there\u2019s a \u2018but\u2019 The denizens of parliament gathered in the Great Hall on Wednesday night for the annual midwinter ball, the Australian equivalent of the nerd prom. A tradition of the occasion is roasts delivered by the leaders. Tony Abbott tried hard, and won more than he lost, acknowledging that amongst other personal foibles that he was a \u201cwinker from way back\u201d. But the consensus in the room was it was Bill Shorten\u2019s night. The Labor leader exhibited more deftness in walking the line between laughing at his opponent, laughing at the overweening ego and self-importance in the room, laughing at the colleagues, but most importantly, laughing at himself. Shorten\u2019s having a good trot, ahead in the opinion polls, colleagues not causing much trouble, a government seemingly intent on a bout of political self-destruction. As Shorten pointed out in his roast, not much has changed in Canberra post-election apart from Labor changing offices: the government presently finds itself in much the same quagmire that Labor found itself in in office. The times suits Shorten. Yet myriad challenges loom, and it is not always clear Shorten possesses the disciplined focus and precision for the looming challenges. It\u2019s also not clear Labor possesses the heart for a fight on legacy issues that are politically controversial, yet definitional in the values space. Labor is running dead on climate change and avoiding conflict at all costs on asylum policy, all classic small-target stuff \u2013 but a posture not without risks when Labor is yet to atone to its base for the self-indulgence of the civil war in government; and when the progressive vote remains well and truly up for grabs. The triumph of common sense on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation The Senate\u2019s second rejection of the bill to repeal the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was mostly noted for the fact that it delivered Tony Abbott his first double dissolution trigger, even though he is highly unlikely to pull it. But it also represented a triumph of common sense, given that the so-called \u201cgreen bank\u201d is investing in exactly the kinds of projects the government is hoping to attract with its \u201cdirect action\u201d climate change policy, but instead of costing the government $10 or $20 per tonne of carbon abated (we have to wait until the \u201creverse auctions\u201d are held to know what Direct Action will cost), it is returning a profit to the budget of $2.40 per tonne of abated carbon. It invests commercially, but co-finances projects traditional lenders might not take on alone because they lack specialist expertise in the technology or need a shorter payback period. Having backed itself into a corner on the issue in opposition \u2013 accusing the bank of investing in all kinds of risky projects with hardworking taxpayers\u2019 borrowed money \u2013 the Coalition says it will reintroduce legislation for the repeal next week to try to get it through the new Senate after July. But it may not have any better luck then. Labor and the Greens will again vote against the repeal, the Palmer United party\u2019s position is unclear, the Motoring Enthusiast party says the bank \u201cappears to be a good thing\u201d, independent senator Nick Xenophon supports the bank\u2019s retention and DLP senator John Madigan abstained from Wednesday\u2019s vote to abolish it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
