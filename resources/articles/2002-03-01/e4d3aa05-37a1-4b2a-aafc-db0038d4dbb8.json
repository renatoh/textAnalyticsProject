The Almighty says: \"Those who conceal what we have revealed of the clear signs and the guidance after we have made them clear in the Scripture, such are those whom Allah curses and such are those who are cursed by those who curse.\" The the Ummah that numbers one billion, to the Ummah of jihad, the Ummah of martyrdom and self-martyrdom, to the Ummah that came to be the best community ever raised for mankind, to our Islamic Ummah (we say): How identical is tonight with yesterday, how numerous are the lessons but how little is the learning, for how long have we been made to drink from the beakers of humiliation and forced to part with the fathers since our affairs have been presided over by the lowly ones. Our Muslim Ummah, He who sees things with clarity and discernment, he who comprehends things through the logic of reason and he who probes the depth of events will know real well that the Ummah has awaken from its slumber and has known its route, whose features have manifested themselves and whose milestone have appeared. The Ummah has by now known that when clemency is damaging forgiveness is a sign of incapacity, that patience is usually good except over what may bring harm to religion, that perseverance is usually praise worthy except when the moment for action is opportune. The Ummah has risen in the form of al-Aqsa uprising and the stone has spoken in the hands of the noble mujahideen, whether men or women, whether young or old. As a result, the Jews have tried to escape but to no avail. They have found no refuge and have been totally exposed, even as they hide behind walls, facing exploding human bodies that make them taste death, that chase them with terror and inflict a tremor on them so much so that they have become like affrighted assess fleeing from a lion. Then came the New York military expedition to set afire the homes of today's Hubal\u00b9 crushing its towers, disgracing its arrogance, undoing its magic, stripping all the banners that marched behind it and proclaiming the beginning of its downfall, God-willing. These enormous events are the blessed jihad that pursued its march toward the aspired goal and the promised eventuality and that has come in order to expose the feeble excuse and refutable pretext which says: \"What may we do, nothing is within our means, it is just not up to us.\" Such an excuse has no place any more. No heart will accommodate it and no conscience will accept it. In view of the bloody events to which our Ummah is being subjected, everyone today is demanded to strive and work seriously. People's leaderships, at all levels, must move in order to stop the surging bloodletting and to scandalize these overt treacheries. Any of such leaderships that cannot move because of the pressure or terror exercised against them by these regimes, the least they can do is to allow initiative taking by others who are more resourceful and more daring and more capable of effecting change, reinstating matters in their appropriate places, so as to warn against inaction and detraction and to avoid the process of ill-advised waiting and forbidden monopoly. It is jihad which motivated those young men who responded to the Almighty who says: \"When the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever you find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem ...\" Al-Tawbah: verse number 5. It is this Jihad which is capable of instigating and mobilizing others from amongst the children of the Ummah. Whereas Jihad will continue until the Day of Resurrection, our days as individuals are numbered and we shall later stand before the Almighty Allah who says: \"Then shall anyone who has done an atom's weight of good, see it, and anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it.\" Al-Zalzalah: verses numbered 7-8 Our Muslim Ummah, Abu Rughal\u00b2 has continued for a century to reincarnate in the Ummah reappearing time after time in his person and treacherous personality, seeking to bring about defeat, to bring down the banner, to bury jihad alive, to provide infidelity with success and to reinforce its foundations. The initiative of prince Abdallah ibn Abd al-Aziz (a U.S.-Zionist initiative in the garbs of the Saudi government) is none but another trick of the tricks of Abu Rughal, and a conspiracy and another form of the repeated forms of treason perpetrated by the rulers of the region against our causes in general and against the cause of al-Aqsa in particular. As he proclaims such a thing, he follows the way of his father who aborted the uprising of the year 1936 AD / 1354H by virtue of a false promise made by him and by the English government. He deceived the Palestinians who ended the uprising permitting the English occupation to continue until 1948 AD / 1366 H when Palestine was handed over to the Jews. As such, he also follows the way of his likes of the traitorous rulers who mobilized the English-commandeered seven armies under the leadership of the English government's man (Globb Pasha). In so doing, they brought to an end the serious popular move in the direction of liberating Palestine, and thus complemented the conspiracy by signing a truce that brought about a ceasefire in the year 1949 AD / 1367 H. Their greatest treason aimed at ending the first al-Aqsa uprising, however, was hatched at Oslo in 1992 AD / 1412 H. 1.
