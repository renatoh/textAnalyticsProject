One is how far improving the NHS means tightening conditions under which the UK's 20,000 consultants work. The other is whether New Labour's penchant for targets is leading to excessive centralisation. Consultants say they are being forced to perform less complex operations at the expense of longer, but sometimes more vital, surgery. Once, a Labour government talked of stuffing consultants' mouths with gold That was Nye Bevan when the NHS was created in 1948. Alan Milburn also wants to pay them more, but on condition they cut out private work in their first seven years after qualifying. Consultants respond that they give the NHS lots of free hours and need private patients. Sounds like a classic conflict of public and private interest Labour's plan for health involves a frontal assault on professional privilege - for the first time a contract will spell out exactly what is expected of consultants. In parallel, the General Medical Council wants regular \"revalidation\" of doctors' competence in order to weed out the dodgy ones. Consultants are bitterly opposed to a lot of this and may have forced out the chairman of the GMC, Sir Donald Irvine. Are there too many targets? Probably. In a recent report the former chief medical officer Sir Kenneth Calman complained that local managers were being stultified by demands from the centre.
