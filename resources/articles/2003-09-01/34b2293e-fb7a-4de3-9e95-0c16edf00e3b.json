Father-of-three Ian Rimell, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, died when his vehicle was attacked yesterday afternoon as he drove along a main road towards Mosul. Mr Rimell, 53, who worked for the British-based charity, Mines Advisory Group (MAG), was on his way home from work with his bodyguard in a vehicle that carried the distinctive MAG emblem when gunmen opened fire on them. Mr Rimmel was killed, and his bodyguard, Salem Ahmed Mohammed, was left in a critical condition. Earlier in the day, Mr Rimell had cleared a scrap heap filled with ammunition and hidden explosives. He later delivered the scrap metal for the rebuilding of a local school. \"MAG's staff are devastated by the loss of their good friend and colleague. He was a dedicated humanitarian who worked so well with the local people,\" said MAG's executive director, Lou McGrath. \"Our thoughts are with the families and our prayers are with Salem as he remains in a serious condition. We are further reviewing our areas of operation in Iraq following this attack,\" he added. MAG has been in Iraq without interruption for more than a decade with 700 mainly local staff in northern Iraq. It is one of the few international aid agencies that has stayed in Iraq, providing mine clearance and mine risk education throughout the conflict. Mr Rimell, the holder of a British Empire Medal, was married with three grown up children. He joined MAG in January this year after an already long career in mine and bomb disposal. \"His family have asked that we express how much Mr Rimell valued his humanitarian work with MAG. He was particularly dedicated to passing on his vast experience to the local staff,\" a spokesperson for the charity said. A Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed that a British national had been killed on September 4 while working in northern Iraq. \"We stand ready to offer any appropriate consular assistance to family or next of kin,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
