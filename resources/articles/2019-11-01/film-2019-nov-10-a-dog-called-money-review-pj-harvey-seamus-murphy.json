Yikes. What was intended as an examination of the creative process backfires and becomes instead an inadvertent chronicle of oblivious privilege. Harvey wafts through scenes of poverty and devastation, then returns to her cocoon of a studio. I have no doubt that the project was well-intentioned, but the editing \u2013 cutting from the abject desperation of migrants at the Greek-North Macedonian border to Harvey noodling about with traditional instruments from the region \u2013 feels glib. Very few of the people who Harvey meets on her journey are developed as characters. The result is an ill-judged film in which suffering becomes scenery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
