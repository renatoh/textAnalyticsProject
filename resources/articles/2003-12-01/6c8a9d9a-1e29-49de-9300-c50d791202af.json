Starting with a couple of small newspapers in Canada, he eventually gobbled up the Daily Telegraph, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and the Spectator. The recent troubles with regard to his holding company, Hollinger International, have come at a rather inconvenient time, as he has just published a substantial biography of his hero, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Weighing in at 1,280 pages, it's a formidable thing. One cannot help but wonder when Black found the time for such a project, although he has in the past been attracted to large historical figures, such as Napoleon and Churchill: men who bestrode their times like colossi. FDR was certainly a bestrider, steering the United States through the great depression and most of the second world war. Father of the \"new deal\", he was widely regarded as a strong, paternal figure who led his country expertly through tough times with a cheery smile. That he was stricken by polio in his late 30s yet soldiered on only added to his mystique. Black obviously adores Roosevelt. Regarding his decision to reactivate Douglas MacArthur in 1941, despite the general's reactionary tendencies, he writes: \"Subsequent events would indicate that Roosevelt's judgment was correct, as it almost always was in tactical political matters.\" In Black's eyes, FDR could do no wrong: \"With the sole possible exception of Abraham Lincoln's conservation of the Union and emancipation of the slaves ... Roosevelt's achievement in bringing the United States out of isolation, invaluably supporting the Allies, and engineering entry into the war by becoming a target of Axis aggression, was the greatest feat of any American statesman in the country's history.\" His suggestion that FDR \"engineered\" US entry into the war by making his country a vulnerable target is on the money. A majority of Americans in 1941 were against getting involved in the war, and Roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940 with a pledge that the US would never head into battle overseas \"unless attacked\". This was disingenuous, of course; the president was far-sighted enough to see that the US would eventually have to enter the war, and would do so on the side of Britain, its natural ally. The degree to which he actually provoked Japan into attacking Pearl Harbor remains a point of controversy, but Black is unfazed, praising Roosevelt's \"talents at dissembling and political manipulation\". Quite rightly, Black pictures Roosevelt as a man determined to shape public opinion. During the 1930s, he worked to create the impression that socialism was \"evil\" and liberal democracy \"good\". \"Roosevelt had predisposed the American public to think in terms of the confrontation of good and evil in the whole world, which proved a useful precedent for the cold war to come,\" Black writes. If there is any irony in his formulation, I can't find it. FDR understood that Americans have a strong puritanical streak. They seem to like it when their leaders conjure an \"evil empire\" in need of destruction. This ploy worked well for Ronald Reagan, and George W Bush has leaned heavily on the \"evil empire\" ploy as well, portraying himself as the defender of civilisation against terrorists who \"hate freedom\", as he puts it. The Roosevelt shadow seems long and embracing. As Black reminds us, FDR was raised in an elegant manor on the Hudson river. He moved easily among the upper classes, who recognised him as one of their own. He was popular at Groton, the exclusive school in Connecticut that he attended during the last years of the 19th century. At Harvard, he belonged to the Republican club, and largely avoided anything academic. Like many sons of the privileged classes (including George W), he did just enough work to get a \"gentleman's C\". At a young age \"there began to emerge in Franklin certain traits that would become notorious at the height of his public career\", we are told. \"His devious tendencies were more evident than ever before in his letters home [from school]; his own achievements were exaggerated, shortcomings were never his fault, and reflections on rivals, no matter how narrow the field of competition, become acidulous.\" Biography is, of course, a form of autobiography, and Black repeatedly portrays Roosevelt as a conniving, ambitious man who invariably saw how to get the better of his competitors. This biography is a tale of clever feints, dirty deeds, shrewd gestures and vengeful moves. There is some truth in this portrayal, yet Black is far too eager to praise FDR as a self-promoter. The man did, after all, engineer the new deal. He declared his era \"the age of the common man\", and he deserves credit for many of its liberal and democratic aspects. Black fails to appreciate the genuine importance of the new deal to average Americans. His argument, a familiar one, is that FDR wanted merely to thwart the emerging threat of socialism. But the story is more complicated than Black suggests. As Arthur Schlesinger once said, the first new deal \"told business what it must do; the second new deal characteristically told business what it must not do\". The first wave of reforms, in essence, gave an electric shock to the economy and put food in the bellies of millions of starving people. The second wave was largely regulatory, establishing the basic rules for corporate behaviour which have, more or less, remained in place for several generations. Roosevelt understood that a lot of ordinary American labourers and farmers were in deep trouble. Black misses this, even though his assumption that the new deal was created to protect capitalism is not without merit. As he notes, FDR had little sympathy for union leaders but understood that \"some modest degree of wealth redistribution was necessary\". Without it, the threat of \"a confiscatory regime\" was real. What Black does not provide, however, is any sense of what the new deal meant for those who had previously lived without the safety net of social services (such as a state-sponsored pension) or protection against the abuses of large corporations. Black sticks to the public life: elections won, programmes passed, generals appointed. FDR's long, painful and distinctly erotic relationship with Lucy Mercer, his mistress, is barely mentioned. Eleanor Roosevelt is treated like a minor annoyance, and no attempt is made to understand the complex dynamics of the Roosevelt marriage. The first lady herself is caricatured as a leftwing lunatic, even though her ideas and ideals had a profound effect on her husband, who without her might never have emerged as an advocate for the poor and dispossessed. Though teeming with facts and figures, Black's life of Roosevelt never brings its subject to life. FDR is a phantom here, breezing through life at the top while manipulating those around him with eerie detachment; Black calls opponents who dared to question the president's policies \"termites\". I put this book down feeling thoroughly confused about FDR. Without being a man of obvious intellectual gifts, often exhausted and unwell, barely able to stand for more than 45 minutes at a time, he nevertheless projected an aura of authority and self-confidence. He led a vast nation through terrible times, earning their respect and gratitude. How did he manage this? What was he really like? What was he thinking? Who was he? Conrad Black does not answer these questions. \u00b7 Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, is editor of The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
