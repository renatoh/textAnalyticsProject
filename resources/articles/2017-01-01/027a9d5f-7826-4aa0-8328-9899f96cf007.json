She has also vowed to ban the burqa in all Queensland government buildings, saying she wants Queensland to \u201clead the way\u201d with banning the Muslim attire in Australia. One Nation was officially registered as a party in Western Australia this week, in preparation for the WA election on 11 March. A new ReachTel poll of 2,126 Australians, released on Monday, showed the party has been rising steadily in the polls from a nationwide Senate vote of 4.3% at the July election, to a Newspoll in October showing it with a vote of 6%, to a new primary vote of 9.7%, ahead of the Greens on 8.9%. Hanson, who travelled across Queensland last week in a high-profile campaign with One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, has faced scrutiny for her taxpayer-funded campaigning. But she told Sky News host Paul Murray that all of her travelling in Queensland has been done as a federal senator. \u201cEverything that I\u2019m doing now in Queensland travelling, is like meeting the farming sector to do what the federal politics and um, I went up to Townsville also to deal with the escalating crime that\u2019s actually happening there,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cSo what I\u2019m doing is on official, you know, parliamentary duties and businesses, like I go out to Chinchilla for the coal seam gas mining, the impacts it\u2019s having there, so I\u2019m getting around and doing my job that I\u2019m supposed to do as a senator, so we\u2019re having public meetings.\u201d Hanson said if One Nation wins power in the Queensland election, due in 2018, she will ban the burqa. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to do? I\u2019m going to investigate it, ban the burqa in government buildings and banks and schools, in Queensland,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lead the way in Queensland, we\u2019re going to make it, you know, so no driver\u2019s licences wearing the burqa or anything.\u201d Murray said: \u201cSo if it\u2019s a One Nation government, all Queensland government buildings, no burqa?\u201d Hanson replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The One Nation leader also talked about her invitation to president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in the United States. Hanson on Monday said she was very excited to receive the invitation, and she seriously considered attending, but she has asked her Senate colleague Brian Burston to attend on her behalf. She told Murray she did not know who the invitation came from. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s come from a congressman in the States, any more than that don\u2019t ask me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I thought about it, I thought no I\u2019m going to give this some thought. You know what I\u2019ve been told? Only 20,000 [invitations] have been issued to go to it, and two tickets have been issued to me and the prime minister never got any.\u201d Burston told ABC radio on Tuesday that the invitation had come from Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, rejected Hanson\u2019s plan to ban the burqa in Queensland government buildings, saying such a measure was effectively already in place. Palaszczuk said on Tuesday the state already adhered to a series of national procedures and policies that required people to show their full face when entering government buildings. \u201cAlso for driver\u2019s licences this is already the law so I don\u2019t know what [Hanson\u2019s] particularly talking about when this already exists,\u201d she said. Palaszczuk said the existing policies did not specifically ban burqas but rather required people to display their full face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
