A bath you can fill via mobile phone on your way home from work? Or perhaps a voice-activated teamaker that makes you a cuppa while you lounge in front of EastEnders? You'd probably love to have these gadgets in theory - who wouldn't? New technology always sounds like a great idea, but - as anyone who has ever set the video to record their favourite programme only to find something completely different on the tape will know - it's not always quite such a good thing in reality. The marketing industry is now wising up to the fact that what people say they want isn't always the same as what they are prepared to live with, especially when it comes to new products with which they are unfamiliar. This is bad news for the focus group (the traditional standby of the marketing department that wants to know whether anyone is interested in buying its product), which involves a moderator listening to and watching a group of people behind a two-way mirror discussing a particular topic or reacting to a particular product. Instead, marketers are increasingly turning to \"reality research\". As with reality TV, this involves filming people going about their daily business. The theory is that it allows you to see how they really behave, away from the half-lies and wishful thinking of the focus groups. One such study has been set up to look at how people use technology in their homes. The Octagon Study (its name is taken from General Electric's Octagon, one of the first commercially available TV sets) is backed by Orange, Pace Technology and GWR, and has involved 10 households being filmed over a four-day period by researchers who lived with them. The research is the brainchild of Nick Jankel-Elliott and Scott Walker, former staffers at the ad agency TBWA and the co-founders of Happy Dog, a branding consultancy that specialises in the internet. The pair set up Happy Dog in response to the slowness of traditional ad agencies to respond to the internet age. \"Octagon is about understanding behaviour surrounded by context,\" says Jankel-Elliott. \"Normally, market researchers will focus on one specific aspect of a product or trend to the exclusion of everything else. \"This is about acknowledging that behaviour doesn't happen in a vacuum. Sitting a load of people down in a room with two-way mirrors and asking them questions is a bit like an anthropologist flying a Namibian villager into London to talk to them about their lives.\" So, charged with finding out whether anyone really does interact with their interactive TV, or what internet bookmarks Mr and Mrs Smith of Acacia Avenue have on their home PC, the market researchers took off with their video cameras to visit, among others, a retired \"silver surfer\" couple from the Midlands, a group of six young professionals sharing a house in London, a single mother from Newcastle with a child at primary school, and a Bangladeshi family in the Midlands with five children. The researchers were encouraged to blend in with their subjects, watching TV with them and participating in their everyday lives. Some were luckier than others - one researcher spent almost every night in the pub with a group of twenty-somethings; another found himself being taken on 30-mile bike rides by the policeman whose behaviour he was studying. Levels of technology in the households also varied considerably. One gadget-friendly bunch had the latest personal video recorder and their own domestic intranet, another had just a bog-standard TV and phone line. To get the most useful information for their clients, the researchers avoided early adopters of technology - typically young, single men with a high disposable income. Gadget freaks tend not to be representative as they will buy almost anything. The initial findings of the Octagon Study show that people will use technology in ways its inventors probably never imagined. One family was using broadband technology to pipe sound from the local mosque into their home. Another had two Sony PlayStations - one to play games on, the other used only for playing CDs. Astonishingly, two of the 10 families left their TVs on all day, even when they went out - something they are unlikely to have admitted in a focus group discussion. While no one is announcing the death of the focus group, other major companies have also been looking at the possibilities of reality research. Two years ago, BT commissioned the Henley Centre to carry out a project called BT Street, which included filming families using various technologies in their homes. \"It's all done in a natural environment, so you see what people do as opposed to just believing what they say they do,\" says Marcus Hickman, associate director of the Henley Centre. \"It's notoriously difficult for people to remember how much TV they watch or how much time they spend on the internet.\" This is a polite way of saying that no one really wants to be thought of as a couch potato, so most of us will lie about how much time we spend slobbing out in front of EastEnders. It's also pretty tricky to get anyone to admit their ignorance, which is where studies like this come in. The BT study found there was much confusion about technological jargon - search engines were confused with internet service providers and the participants knew what they wanted to do, but could not describe the process with the correct terminology. Set the task of buying an airline ticket online, one participant backed out when asked to enter the amount in GBP - she didn't know what it meant. But perhaps the most interesting finding was that digital TV was actually uniting families. Because most households only have one digital TV, family members were more likely to gather in front of the TV together than those with only analogue. Families being filmed as they watch TV is probably more The Royle Family than Big Brother - a comparison the researchers prefer. As Hickman says: \"It's being compared with reality TV but we started doing this in 1999, long before Nasty Nick became a household name.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
