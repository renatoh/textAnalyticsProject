And the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority told Westpac it must set aside an additional $500m in capital, bringing the total capital penalty imposed on the bank since the middle of the year to $1bn. Apra said it would also review Westpac\u2019s governance of risk, including executive accountability and remuneration. The investigation comes after Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched legal action against Westpac last month alleging the bank breached anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws 23m times, including by allowing customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a manner consistent with child exploitation. It is the latest blow for the bank over a scandal which has already lopped the heads of its chief executive and chairman and earned a second \u201cstrike\u201d against its remuneration report from furious shareholders. Apra said it would cooperate with investigations being conducted by Austrac and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Separately, federal police are investigating the payments to the Philippines. John Lonsdale, the deputy chair of Apra, said Austrac\u2019s lawsuit raised \u201cserious allegations that question the prudential standing of Australia\u2019s second largest bank\u201d. \u201cWhile Westpac is financially sound, there are potentially substantial gaps in risk governance that need to be closed,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the nature of the matters raised by Austrac, the number of alleged breaches and the period of time over which they occurred, this will necessarily be an extensive and potentially lengthy investigation.\u201d Westpac\u2019s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, who has promised to resign next year as a result of the scandal, said the bank would fully cooperate with the Apra investigation. \u201cWestpac accepts the gravity of the issues presented by Austrac,\u201d he said in a statement to the stock exchange. \u201cAs previously stated, these shortcomings are unacceptable and we are determined to urgently fix these issues and lift our standards. \u201cWe will provide our full support to Apra through its investigation and review.\u201d Apra will conduct the investigation using powers that were beefed up after a money-laundering scandal at Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, in 2017. The regulator said it would investigate whether Westpac\u2019s governance and risk management framework was adequate, whether its executive pay regime was adequate to manage non-financial risks, whether the bank failed to comply with the banking executive accountability regime, whether it failed to comply with prudential standards and whether it failed to report breaches. Apra added $500m to the capital requirements of ANZ, Nab and Westpac banks in July due to the \u201chigher operational risk\u201d discovered in self-reviews ordered by the regulator. The regulator had already hit CBA with an extra $1bn capital requirement after its prudential review discovered problems including complacency and a culture that discouraged criticism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
