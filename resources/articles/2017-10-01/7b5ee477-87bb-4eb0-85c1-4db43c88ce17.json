The Argentinian said after watching the striker score another two goals in Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s authoritative 4-0 win at Huddersfield Town that it is a welcome challenge to keep finding new words to describe Kane\u2019s excellence. The manager, in turn, intends to keep challenging Kane \u2013 because he says the player who is aiming to win the Premier League\u2019s golden boot award for a third consecutive season has plenty of improving to do. \u201cThe moment you stop to work, you start to go down,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cNow it is our job to try keep pushing, working. He is only 24 and for me players will get mature when you are 26, 27 \u2013 that is your best. Now I think he is about to keep going, keep pushing to improve and to learn. With more experience, he will be much, much better.\u201d He is already too good for most defences. Huddersfield had been commendably solid until they ran into Tottenham and were flattened before the first half was finished. Kane scored twice and helped set up Ben Davies for another, with Moussa Sissoko adding a fourth in stoppage time. \u201cFor me he is a world-class player,\u201d the Huddersfield forward Rajiv van La Parra says of Kane. \u201cHis finishing is unbelievable. If you see his second goal here, out of nothing he created something and scored. It\u2019s difficult to play against him.\u201d It is not only Kane. It is difficult to play against Tottenham. Kane is the spearhead of a smoothly functioning side in which every part is in sync. That was exemplified beautifully by their second goal against Huddersfield, which was scored by Davies after a flowing, collective move featuring several one-touch passes. \u201cThey know each other,\u201d Van La Parra says. \u201cThey feel each other. Everything goes a little bit quicker against them. They don\u2019t need much time on the ball to make a decision.\u201d Aaron Mooy, Huddersfield\u2019s artful midfielder, was similarly impressed, saying Spurs were a class above any other side his team have faced since promotion. Asked why, he said: \u201cTheir understanding. They all know exactly what they\u2019re doing. Where to move, where the space is. They\u2019re very sharp in the way they think. Their movement is very, very good and makes it very difficult for you to win the ball.\u201d That fluidity is the sweetest fruit of Pochettino\u2019s work. \u201cEvery headline is about Harry Kane and, yes, I think he is fantastic but the work ethic from the team, from the keeper to the end, is a big value, too,\u201d Pochettino says. Kane agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to play in this team. I\u2019m here to put most of the chances away but when you\u2019ve got Dele [Alli] and Christian [Eriksen], and you\u2019ve got Ben [Davies] and Tripps [Kieran Trippier] in the wide areas, when you\u2019ve got guys backing it up from the back, it all helps. We\u2019ve got a great unit at the minute, a great squad with big players who can come in. We\u2019ve just got to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Kane\u2019s next assignment is with England against Slovenia and Lithuania and he would like not only to continue scoring for his country \u2013 he has a tally of five goals in his last four internationals \u2013 but also to become its figurehead. He captained the team against Scotland and France in June and hopes to be given the armband for good whenever Gareth Southgate decides to award it to one player permanently. \u201cI think he has said he\u2019s kind of taking his time with that,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI\u2019ve had the armband and it was a very proud moment for myself. Whoever he picks next week to be captain, again the team will get behind him and just focus on the job. We\u2019re still not qualified, that\u2019s the most important thing \u2013 to go and win the game on Thursday and then it will make it a bit easier on Sunday. \u201cFor me personally I feel like one of the leaders in the team but we\u2019ve got a lot of them in the England team. I\u2019ve just got to focus on trying to score goals and continuing this form into October. I think the most important thing is doing your talking on the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
