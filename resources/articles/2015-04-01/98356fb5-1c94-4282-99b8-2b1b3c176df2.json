The star of The Girl and the drama Marvellous will play the smug investment banker Roger Yount in Lanchester\u2019s state of the nation tale of the metropolis. Set in a gentrified street in south London, Capital features a stellar cast of top British talent, three of whom are contenders for the forthcoming Bafta Television awards. Jones is joined by fellow nominees Gemma Jones, perhaps best known as Bridget Jones\u2019 mother in the film version of Helen Fielding\u2019s creation, who plays the oldest inhabitant of Pepys Road, as well as Petunia, and Adeel Akhtar, from Channel 4\u2019s Utopia, who plays local newsagent Ahmed. Capital\u2019s line-up also includes Lesley Sharp from ITV\u2019s Scott and Bailey, and BBC2\u2019s The Shadow Line. Robert Emms, from BBC1\u2019s Atlantis, is also in the cast. Lanchester\u2019s story of a street propelled into affluence by banker bonus-fuelled property prices features a range of characters who represent the widening gap between the haves, the have nots and the have yachts. The three-part drama charts the relationships of the inhabitants of the houses on Pepys Road, including that between the buffoonish Roger and his wife Arabella, played by Diana Rigg\u2019s daughter, Rachael Stirling, who starred in BBC4\u2019s Detectorists and ITV\u2019s The Bletchley Circle. Other players in the drama, directed by Euros Lyn, include those who pass through the street, such as the Polish builder Bogdan, portrayed by Polish-born actor Radoslaw Kaim, and Quentina, the Zimbabwean refugee with a PhD working as a traffic warden while under threat of deportation, played by Wunmi Mosaku, who featured in the BBC dramas Moses Jones and Truckers. The residents\u2019 lives change when one day they all receive a mysterious postcard saying: \u201cWe Want What You Have.\u201d According to the BBC: \u201cAs the mystery of the postcards deepens, we learn more about this vivid and unforgettable ensemble of characters. Interweaving stories reveal lives filled with love and loss, fear and greed, fortune and envy, and, most recognisable of all, family and home. \u201cStories bursting with piercing and funny observations on modern life and urban existence, of ordinary people who find themselves caught and changed by a city at a time of extraordinary flux.\u201d Capital has been adapted for television by Peter Bowker, who worked with Toby and Gemma Jones on the BBC2 film Marvellous, the poignant story of Stoke City kit man, clown and lay preacher Neil Baldwin, a show for which they have both received Bafta nominations. Filming of Capital has already started and the show is due to be broadcast this year. Lanchester said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very exciting and very strange to have something on the telly, rather than sitting on the sofa watching it.\u201d Toby Jones said: \u201cObviously I am thrilled to be part of such a fantastic, diverse and talented cast, and also I\u2019m excited to renew my working relationship with Pete Bowker.\u201d The BBC executive producer Lucy Richer said: \u201cIt is wonderful to see such a stellar cast starring in Capital. They are sure to bring Peter Bowker\u2019s stunning scripts to life in their portrayal of such funny, true and brilliant characters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
