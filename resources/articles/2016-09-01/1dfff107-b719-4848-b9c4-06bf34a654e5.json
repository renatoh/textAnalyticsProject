A coalition of Jewish organizations had launched a campaign against the course, claiming it was \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201canti-Israel\u201d, and last week the elite school suspended the class, saying it \u201cdid not receive a sufficient degree of scrutiny\u201d. But on Monday, UC Berkeley announced that a review had determined \u201cthe course does not cross the line between teaching and political advocacy and organizing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this will make the administration think twice before they respond to outside political pressure,\u201d said undergraduate Paul Hadweh, who created the course, which is part of a UC Berkeley program that allows students to teach classes to their peers. The dispute comes at a time of increasingly tense debate surrounding free speech on college campuses and student activism on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Pro-Palestine groups argue that universities have suppressed their right to free speech and protest and that student activists are up against well-funded initiatives aimed at discrediting and harassing individual protesters. But Pro-Israel and Jewish organizations claim that the growing Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) movement \u2013 along with the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) efforts targeting the Israeli government \u2013 are antisemitic and shouldn\u2019t be allowed on campuses. Hadweh\u2019s class, called Palestine: A Settler Colonial Inquiry, aims to explore the region in the context of \u201csettler colonialism\u201d and study how \u201cdecolonization\u201d could \u201copen the possibility for justice and equality for all peoples in the region\u201d. A coalition of opposing groups argued that the syllabus implied that the class \u201cintended to indoctrinate students to hate the Jewish state and take action to eliminate it\u201d. The university, considered the top public college in the US, claimed that it was suspending the course due to procedural concerns, though professors and students said that administrators were responding to negative press and criticisms from Israel advocacy groups. On Sunday, Shari Huhndorf, chair of the department of ethnic studies, said in a letter to administrators that she had determined that the \u201ccourse is structured by open inquiry rather than a specific agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are impressed by how thoughtfully the student facilitator has constructed the course,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cThe histories and dynamics of settler colonialism, structural inequality, and social marginalization are central to our teaching and research.\u201d Hadweh said he has agreed to make minor adjustments to the language of the syllabus, but that the fundamentals of the course are intact. Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, director of the AMCHA Initiative, a Jewish group that led the charge against the class, said on Monday that she had not yet reviewed the new syllabus but was upset the school would allow a course that uses the \u201ccolonialism\u201d framework and promotes \u201cdecolonization\u201d. \u201cIt sounds like the revisions were not adequate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing and suggests that they really are not considering \u2026 what \u2018indoctrination\u2019 really is.\u201d Supporters of the course, along with SJP and BDS activists, have argued that they are not targeting the Jewish faith but are speaking up against the Israeli government and against human rights abuses associated with the occupation of Palestinian territories. Liz Jackson, staff attorney with Palestine Legal, who is representing Hadweh, praised the reinstatement. \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for everyone across the US who is facing this documented and coordinated attack on the right to study and speak freely on Israel and Palestine.\u201d Jackson, who noted that she is a Jewish alumnus of UC Berkeley, said the suspension could still have a chilling effect on free speech. \u201cFor Paul and every other student and scholar on campus who wants to think about \u2026 this international problem from the perspective of Palestinian history, the message that they got from the university is: \u2018We\u2019re going to pay extra attention to you. And you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent to us.\u2019\u201d Hadweh, a 21-year-old senior, who was born in the US and grew up in Palestine, said the ordeal had taken a toll on him. \u201cThe university threw me under the bus and publicly accused me of failing to meet policies and procedures,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis was not the first time something like this happened and unfortunately it probably won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Hadweh said that, on the bright side, it seems the controversy has inspired his class to be particularly enthusiastic. \u201cI never imagined students would be so eager to do reading.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
