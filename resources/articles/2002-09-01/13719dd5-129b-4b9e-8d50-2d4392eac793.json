He can be a severe conductor, cool and at times strong on structure at the expense of emotional insight. Yet when he opened his Philharmonia Prom with Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel, it was apparent that he was playing against type. Dohnanyi is well aware of the seriousness of purpose behind Strauss's portrait of the raffish prankster of German legend, who challenges both bourgeois morality and ecclesiastical strictures. But the work is satire. We are meant to laugh, and when Dohnanyi conducts it, we do. Everything about his performance was immaculately judged, from the false sentimentality of the opening to the wild triumph of the close. The great instrumental solos that characterise Till had swagger, panache and furious wit. Elsewhere, there were moments of Dickensian bite: in the unctuous bassoons that indicate the clerics, and in the parodistic love scenes in which Strauss sends up his own erotic orchestral manner. The remainder of the concert consisted of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto and Dvorak's Eighth Symphony. Here the more familiar Dohnanyi emerged. His clear-sighted approach to Beethoven - focused on the shifts in classical structure that make this most reflective of concertos so revolutionary - sat uneasily with that of his soloist, the ebullient Emanuel Ax, who would probably have been happier with a more overtly dramatic conductor. Dvorak's Eighth, however, did amaze. Dohnanyi emphasised the symphony's debt to composers outside the Czech tradition, bringing out the Tchaikovskian orchestration, the formal procedures that expand on Brahms. The late-night Prom that followed, meanwhile, was a marked contrast. Given by The Cardinall's Musick Consort and Players under their director, Andrew Carwood, it explored 16th-and 17th-century Spanish church music by interweaving sections of Tomas Luis de Victoria's Victory Mass with motets by his contemporaries. The format was not ideal, however. The Mass is glorious but its impact is infinitely stronger when performed without digressions. The singing was gorgeous, though the continuous need to reposition the performers between the Mass and the motets led to endless pauses. And applause was permitted between sections, spoiling the devotional mood of the music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
