The Hyde amendment bars the federal government from paying for abortion care through Medicaid,the government program that provides health insurance to roughly 17 million US women of reproductive age. An abortion costs roughly $600 in the US. In a TV interview with Chris Hayes on MSNBC, Warren said Biden\u2019s position, like those of Republicans passing abortion bans in states across the country, would not stop abortion in America. \u201cUnder the Hyde amendment, under every one of these efforts to try to chip away or push back or get rid of Roe v Wade, understand this, women of means will still have access to abortions,\u201d said Warren, referring to the landmark US supreme court decision which legalized abortion across America. \u201cWho won\u2019t will be poor women, working women, will be women who can\u2019t afford to take off three days from work, will be very young women, will be women who\u2019ve been raped, will be women who\u2019ve been molested by someone in their own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not pass laws that take away that freedom from the women who are most vulnerable.\u201d Biden, who is Catholic, has a mixed record on abortion rights. He said recently he supports a \u201cwoman\u2019s right to choose\u201d, even as he voted to restrict abortion access early in his career as a US senator. Meanwhile, Cory Booker called the Hyde amendment \u201can assault on African American women\u201d while speaking at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s African American Leadership Summit in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday. The US senator and 2020 candidate pledged to create an office of reproductive rights, if he becomes president. It would protect access to birth control and abortion and \u201cend the tragedy that America leads industrial nations in maternal mortality [and that] rates for black women are four times higher than white women\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
