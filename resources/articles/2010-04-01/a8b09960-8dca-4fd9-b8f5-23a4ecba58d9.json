The Ukrainian could have smashed it out of sight but, with a bonus payment for each new mark, naturally preferred to do it centimetre by centimetre. It is thanks solely to the Bubka Theory of Incremental Improvement that Colony is denied the score of 0.00 that it technically deserves. Outlandish as this strikes me with the memory so fresh, the possibility that worse restaurants exist to lower the record set today must at least be acknowledged. If so unmitigated a monstrosity would be an achievement anywhere, let alone in central London, the involvement as executive chef of Atul Kochhar \u2013 a Michelin star-holder at Benares \u2013 allows it to slip the bonds of the merely surreal and suggest a malign biblical miracle. Had Jehovah deployed Colony as the first of the plagues celebrated recently at Passover services, He'd have spared himself slaughtering every first-born Egyptian boy child. One meal would have broken Pharaoh's spirit. Regarding this soul-chilling space, I refer the honourable reader to the review given to Aldo Zilli's vegetarian house of horrors some weeks ago. Here, as there, the pastel walls (crowd-control buttermilk) were grubbier than seemed feasible in a newbie, while aural supremacy lay with a noisy air-con unit. \"This is hideous,\" my wife said as palpably untrained staff hovered unnervingly in a recess by the table, staring remorselessly. \"All it needs is a 2007 edition of Country Life, and it's a posh doctor's waiting room.\" Even stale poppadoms offered no warning of the food to come, which is apparently modelled on old Raj favourites and tapas-y street dishes. Even the starters, being no worse than abysmal, flattered to deceive. \"Crisp\" calamari were soggy, the squid in both texture and taste bringing to mind a condom fitted over an unwashed garlic press the day timetable confusion forced the cookery teacher to take sex education at short notice. Crab in pastry left a bitter, curry powder aftertaste. And fennel-marinated lamb chops were overcooked lumps of nasty meat. Once a hoverer had cleared the plates, a pubescent boy of our acquaintance, born three weeks before New Labour came to power, echoed the prevailing sentiment of his earliest infancy to posit the belief that things could only get better. In terms of heroically misplaced optimism, humanity hasn't heard the like since Butch told Sundance, \"For a moment there, I thought we were in trouble\" some two seconds before the entire Bolivian army opened fire. \"No, no,\" said my wife, unveiling herself as a rhyming existentialist as she tasted her main course, \"this kedgeree cannot be.\" It could be, however, and it was. \"It tastes like rice thrown into a pan of stale oil and sluiced around with burnt hot dog onions and some unidentifiable fish. Sorry, but I just can't eat it.\" The boy's \"grilled tiger prawn caesar salad\" raised the inedibility bar by more than a centimetre. Prawns with the texture of tofu were swamped by grey bacon bits. As for my \"pot of chicken stew\", allegedly flavoured with star anise, cinnamon and much else, but tasting solely of lime-infused goat's milk, all the pot contained were a couple of mouthfuls of noxious curry. No rice, no veg (no need to order anything with it, I'd been told), no nuffink. All having returned to the kitchen barely touched, a French chap sidled over to report the chef's insistence that the food was fine. Perhaps so, I said, but the chef doesn't have to eat it. He nodded in morose acquiescence, revealed that Kochhar himself was abroad, denied us a bill, and asked us to return for another meal on the house. Why do we underrate the Gallic flair for irony? And so let the quest begin. Five restaurants capable of skinning the record by a hundredth of a point each are sought before we reach the bridge over the Rubicon into the mystical land of negative scoring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
