The Dish Network is betting that for a significant number of consumers, especially young consumers, the answer is yes. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, Dish announced a new subscription-based entertainment package that will offer a small batch of cable channels at a fraction of the cost of most cable subscriptions. The service, called Sling TV, will be accessible on any device with an internet connection. The basic roster of channels will include ESPN, ESPN2, CNN, the Disney Channel, the Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, TNT and TBS. The service will not include the television networks ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox or Univision. Industry wisdom has held that one factor stopping consumers from abandoning cable subscriptions in favor of online streaming has been the inability without such subscriptions to access ESPN and HBO, home to Game of Thrones and other popular programming. Last fall, HBO announced it was exploring a standalone subscription service that reportedly could cost as much as $15 a month. With Dish\u2019s announcement on Monday, the big-box cable model has sustained another damaging blow. The chief executive of Sling TV called the new product a \u201cgame changer\u201d. \u201cLive television, including ESPN, for $20 per month with no commitment or contract, is a game changer,\u201d said Roger Lynch in a statement. \u201cThe arrival of Sling TV lets consumers, who\u2019ve embraced services like Netflix and Hulu, take more control of their video entertainment experience.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
