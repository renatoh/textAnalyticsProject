Instead, Mexico were beaten in the final thanks to a hat-trick that they had not anticipated - three goals by Denmark\u2019s 15-year-old forward, Susanne Augustesen. \u201cThere were over 100,000 people in the Azteca Stadium and when we walked out, the shouting and drumming was so loud that we couldn\u2019t even hear each other when we tried to talk,\u201d recalls Birte Kjems, Denmark\u2019s goalkeeper. \u201cBut after Susanne\u2019s third goal we heard something very strange: applause from the home crowd. People told us afterwards that that was one of the first times they had heard fans in the Azteca applaud the opposition.\u201d Mexican fans, who a year earlier had been wowed by Pele and Carlos Alberto, knew quality play when they saw it and were happy to show their appreciation. It was all quite different to what Kjems was used to - and to what followed for Denmark\u2019s world champions. \u201cAt my club [Ribe], we would normally have 50 to 100 spectators, maybe 300 for a very important match,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cSo the World Cup made us nervous and excited. Even for the first match [a 3-0 win over France in Guadalajara], there was something like 40,000 people in the stadium. And the atmosphere around the country was amazing. It was like, \u2018we\u2019ve had the Olympics and the men\u2019s World Cup, now here come the women so let\u2019s make a big party for them, too.\u2019 It was quite a new world. There was something in the papers about women\u2019s football every day and everywhere we went people wanted photographs and autographs. You could never just walk out to a shop because there were big crowds waiting for us around the hotel.\u201d Denmark had arrived as the No 1 team thanks to their victory in the inaugural edition of the tournament in Italy in 1970. But this was a very different team, as the side that had triumphed the previous year had been made up of players from one club, Boldklubben Femina. For the 1971 competition the Kvindelig Fodbold Union (Danish Women\u2019s Football Union, which was set up because the country\u2019s Uefa-backed union, the DBU, would not admit women), decided to form a truly national team. They held trials across the country to select a squad. Helene Hansen, scorer of one of the goals in the 2-0 victory over Italy in the 1970 final, was the only player to appear for Denmark in both tournaments. As for the first tournament, travel and accommodation were covered by the sponsors, the Italian drinks company Martini &amp; Rossi. The solidarity between the competitors was such that when the Danish team bus broke down in the desert on the way from the capital to Guadalajara, the Italian team picked them up and the sides travelled on together. They met again in their final group game, sharing a 1-1 draw that enabled both to progress to the semi-finals. Denmark trounced Argentina 5-0 but Italy were knocked out by the host nation. \u201cApparently they were very bad losers,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cThey had been very aggressive during the match and afterwards they smashed up mirrors and toilets in the dressing rooms and everything.\u201d Italy recovered their composure sufficiently to win the third-place playoff, while Denmark won the tournament \u2013 and the admiration of the Azteca crowd \u2013 with a 3-0 triumph over Mexico in the final. As a promotional gimmick, pink and white hoops had been painted on the goalpost for the tournament and all stadium staff wore pink uniforms. Naturally, then, there was only one way for the Danes to celebrate their victory. \u201cWe had a bath in pink champagne!\u201d recalls Kjems. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it came from, I didn\u2019t even know pink champagne existed, but there was lots of it after the final!\u201d Denmark flew home as the two-times world champions. \u201cOrdinary people were very excited but not the official men,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cOn the day we landed the head of the DBU [Vilhelm Skousen] said there would never be women members of the Danish Football Union during his lifetime. Oh hello, welcome home!\u201d Skousen was one of many influential men who insisted the interest of Denmark\u2019s public and media in women\u2019s football was a fad. \u201cWe cannot and will not take this seriously in the DBU,\u201d he said. But the decision was taken out of his hands when Uefa ruled that member associations had to open their doors to women. The DBU did so in 1972. But only half-heartedly and in a way that undid much of the good development work women had done for themselves. \u201cThey said to us \u2018your tournament and national league is a no-go\u2019,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t take our system, instead it was \u2018You have to start from scratch, we have to see if you are really serious about playing football\u2019. They could have built on our way of doing things but they said \u2018no, no, we have to do it the men\u2019s way.\u2019 \u201cWe had a tournament all over the country but now we had to start from level zero with small local teams. We were winning matches 9-0 so it was very boring, especially for me as a goalkeeper. And at the national team we were no longer allowed to play in unofficial tournaments, only against nations whose women\u2019s team had official status. So for years we could only really play against Nordic teams. I and other players lost some of our best football years because men insisted on doing things their way and weren\u2019t quick enough about it. So I think, even now, it is very important for women do stand up and do things for themselves. Don\u2019t wait for men to do it for you.\u201d The memory of Denmark\u2019s double world champions soon faded, even in their own country. So there there was widespread surprise when the film-maker Jakob Thygesen told their story in a 2017 documentary. Augustesen, who was never given an official cap after her hat-trick despite going on to enjoy a successful career in Italy in which she scored over 600 goals, was admitted into the DBU\u2019s Hall of Fame two years go. But given the way the legacy of Denmark\u2019s world champions was, to a large extent, squandered, it is perhaps fitting that their trophy remains missing. \u201cIt was a beautiful trophy, an angel standing on top of a football, but no one knows where it is,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cWe know it made it back into the country because there are pictures of us with it at Copenhagen airport but that is all we know. After the renewed interest in our story there were appeals and media ads looking for it, but so far it has not turned up. But we still have wonderful memories of what we did.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
