Stoke hope to have O\u2019Neill looking on when they play Barnsley at Oakwell on Saturday. O\u2019Neill has a contract until 2024 worth \u00a3800,000 a year with the Irish Football Association, which confirmed on Thursday it had received an approach from Stoke. Negotiations are continuing and Stoke may have to pay as much as \u00a31m for O\u2019Neill. Northern Ireland\u2019s games against the Netherlands and Germany on Saturday week and the following Tuesday respectively are also a key point for discussion. Should O\u2019Neill accept the post, he is likely to be handed a lucrative package, possibly up to \u00a31.5m a year on a long-term contract. Steve Harper, who forms part of the Northern Ireland backroom team, would likely follow O\u2019Neill to England. \u201cThe Irish Football Association has been approached by Stoke who are seeking permission to speak to Michael O\u2019Neill about their vacant manager\u2019s position,\u201d the IFA said. Stoke sacked Nathan Jones last week and are the bottom of the Championship. An attempt to lure Alex Neil from Preston failed. A number of clubs and the Scotland national team have endured frustrations with regards O\u2019Neill. The former Shamrock manager\u2019s stock soared after guiding Northern Ireland to Euro 2016. They are also likely to earn a playoff berth for next summer\u2019s European Championship. Tommy Wright, who is in charge of St Johnstone, and the Motherwell manager, Stephen Robinson, would be the early favourites to replace O\u2019Neill at Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
