It was 2004 and, in the Dili heat, the distinguished US diplomat sat opposite Australian officials, bartering over a nation\u2019s future. Timor-Leste\u2019s government, with Galbraith as its chief negotiator, was desperate to get a fair deal from the bountiful underwater oil and gas reserves that lay between it and Australia, a trusted ally and regional powerhouse. Success would give it a significant share of fields worth $40bn-$50bn, helping lift the fledgling nation out of poverty. Failure would blow the tyres of an economy heavily reliant on natural resources. The game, though, was rigged. Unbeknownst to Galbraith, Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis) agents had been instructed to bug key offices of the Timor-Leste government. The listening devices would reveal Timor-Leste\u2019s bottom line, its negotiating tactics and the competing views of cabinet members. \u201cIt was outrageous,\u201d Galbraith tells Guardian Australia from his home in the US. \u201cI\u2019d taken protective measures against Australian espionage, which I thought would be based on cell phones and internet, but I thought it was pretty crude to be bugging the prime minister\u2019s offices. \u201cIt was not what you do to a friendly state. And it was not something you do for commercial advantage.\u201d The Asis operation remained secret. The treaty was signed. Australia secured a 50-50 split of the Greater Sunrise fields, positioned 450km north-west of Darwin and 150km south of Timor-Leste. It was a good deal for the Australian government, and a boon for the joint venture of multinationals, led by Woodside, seeking to exploit the Timor Sea. As a former US ambassador to Croatia, Galbraith had frequent access to US intelligence. Never has he seen his country attempt an operation as commercially driven as Australia\u2019s was. \u201cThe whole experience of the negotiation from 2000 on and through this whole episode was to see a country that \u2013 yes, in many ways focuses on the public good \u2013 but where corporate greed was a big part of it, because the Howard and Downer government, they were shills for the corporations,\u201d Galbraith said. \u201cThat was what was really important to them. \u201cThat is not something that goes on in the United States. It was pretty shocking.\u201d Australia\u2019s actions would have been buried in perpetuity, had it not been for one Asis operative, known only as Witness K. The senior intelligence officer felt deeply uncomfortable about the operation, which was mounted during a heightened regional terror threat due to the 2002 Bali bombings. He eventually approached the intelligence watchdog, the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS). The spy obtained permission to talk to an approved lawyer, Bernard Collaery, a barrister and one-time attorney general for the ACT. Collaery helped the Timor-Leste government build a case against Australia at The Hague, alleging the bugging had rendered the treaty void. The revelations were splashed across mainstream media, first through the Australian, then the ABC. In Timor-Leste, the pair were seen as heroes. \u201cWitness K, as the secret agent became known, and Collaery, are brave Australians,\u201d former Timor-Leste president Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta wrote last month while calling for the pair to be awarded his nation\u2019s highest honour. \u201cIndividuals with a conscience and courage, representing the very best of Australians as I know them \u2013 instinctively sympathetic to the underdog, the weak and vulnerable.\u201d The love for Collaery and Witness K runs deeper still among the Timor-Leste people, according to Prof Clinton Fernandes of the University of New South Wales, who has followed the case closely. Civil society groups have printed \u201csolidarity with Bernard Collaery\u201d T-shirts and banners, which Fernandes says will soon be a visible presence across Dili. \u201cThere\u2019s another aspect to this affair that most Australians haven\u2019t appreciated \u2013 the moral injury felt by the people of Timor-Leste,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cThey want Australia to be a good neighbour, not an eavesdropper who breaks the 10th commandment repeatedly. Collaery is a great Australian in their eyes.\u201d It\u2019s a stark contrast to their treatment in Australia. Witness K and Collaery now face jail time for helping correct what they saw as a gross injustice. This week, Witness K pleaded guilty to sharing protected Asis information. Collaery will fight on, facing a partially secret trial in the ACT supreme court, the court where he has spent much of his life practicing. The pair\u2019s actions embarrassed powerful forces within government, intelligence, and corporate Australia. Those forces would wait almost a decade to exact revenge. In the summer of 2013, young law clerk Chloe Preston was sitting alone at Collaery\u2019s home practice in Narrabundah, Canberra. Outside, the suburban streets were quiet, save for the gentle hum of the beehives Collaery keeps in his front garden. The doorbell rang about 9am. Preston remembers her shock at opening the door to 10 officers, including agents from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio). Collaery had flown to The Hague 24 hours earlier to ready Timor-Leste\u2019s case against Australia. The officers produced a warrant, most of which had been blacked out, and offered a simple explanation for their presence: \u201cnational security\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as a national security issue then and I don\u2019t now,\u201d Preston tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe were no threat to national security; this was a blatant bullying tactic by the Australian government, designed to intimidate.\u201d The raid lasted six hours, stretching well into the afternoon. The officers rifled through Collaery\u2019s documents. Preston remembers seeing one officer on the floor of Collaery\u2019s lounge room, reading through a folder of documents directly related to the arbitration between Timor-Leste and Australia. \u201cI remember thinking to myself that this was nothing short of cheating,\u201d Preston says. \u201cA party to a legal case, had just waltzed into their opponent\u2019s chambers, and seized their legal briefs. \u201cAs a law clerk, a week out from being admitted as a solicitor, and as an Australian citizen, who believed that I lived in a fair democratic country, I lost a lot of confidence in the government, and the law, that day.\u201d A second raid was taking place at the home of Witness K, who was preparing to give evidence at The Hague. Collaery called in to the ABC from Europe to express his fury, alleging Australia was trying to intimidate Witness K and stop him from giving evidence. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more crass than what has occurred,\u201d he said. The raids were just the start. Witness K\u2019s passport was seized, preventing him from flying to The Hague. His efforts to get it back stretched across six years of secret hearings in the administrative appeals tribunal. Collaery says Witness K was put through \u201csix years of seclusion, harassment and questioning\u201d. Collaery\u2019s own attempts to publish a book on the affair prompted threats of jail from the Australian government. The most shocking development came midway through last year. Timor-Leste had by then dropped its case against Australia, paving the way for the signing of a new treaty on the Timor Sea maritime boundary in March 2018. The revised deal was far more favourable to the smaller nation, and it is now expected to reap between 70% and 80% of total revenue. Three months after the treaty was signed, independent MP Andrew Wilkie revealed the Australian government had approved the prosecution of Witness K and Collaery. \u201cWith the diplomacy out of the way it\u2019s time to bury the bodies,\u201d Wilkie said under parliamentary privilege. Crossbench senator Rex Patrick accused prosecutors of sitting on evidence for three years to avoid a diplomatic incident. The pair were charged with conspiring to breach section 39 of the Intelligence Services Act for allegedly communicating information they obtained in the course of employment or an agreement with Asis. The case drew immediate condemnation from lawyers, former judges, academics, and civil society groups. Labor has, so far, been relatively quiet on the case. It has fallen on individuals such as former Victorian premier Steve Bracks and NSW shadow attorney general Paul Lynch to take up the cause. \u201cThis prosecution seems designed to punish whistleblowers,\u201d Lynch tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is that what they revealed should be deeply shaming to Australia. Australia\u2019s intelligence services were revealed to be illegally bugging a foreign government, when the substantial benefits would flow to private corporations \u2013 all at a time when our intelligence services should have focused on terrorist threats.\u201d The case against Collaery and Witness K comes as Australia pursues a range of whistleblowers with vigour. Prosecutors have lodged separate criminal proceedings against Richard Boyle, a tax office whistleblower, and David McBride, a military lawyer who leaked documents to ABC journalists. Other whistleblowers have faced threats and termination for revealing information clearly in the public interest. The cases have opened a debate about the adequacy of Australia\u2019s whistleblowing protections. This week, Griffith University integrity expert Prof AJ Brown and his team published a major study examining the experiences of whistleblowers. It found less than 1% of whistleblowers ended up going to the media, which Brown described as \u201cfar less external disclosure than we actually want or need\u201d if wrongdoing was to be properly addressed. Those who blew the whistle externally experienced at least a third more repercussions than whistleblowers who stayed internal, the research found. The report also identified a separate need to reform blanket criminal prohibitions on the unauthorised release of information, similar to those used to prosecute Witness K and Collaery case. Instead, secrecy laws should make allowances for disclosures in the public interest, the report said. Such an approach was recommended in 2010 by the Australian Law Reform Commission\u2019s inquiry into secrecy laws but has not been implemented. \u201cThe challenge was, and remains, how to ensure the general law protects all persons who might need to justifiably breach confidentiality, by enabling any person to call on and argue a public interest defence in such circumstances \u2013 such as traditionally existed under common law principles,\u201d Prof Brown\u2019s report found. \u201cSuch a reform would parallel improvements to whistleblower laws, rather than seeking to convert whistleblower protection laws into more general laws aimed at public disclosure of information.\u201d Fernandes, from UNSW, said the case speaks to another critical institutional failing: the inability for Australia\u2019s parliament to scrutinise intelligence operations. He said Australia could consider adopting the US model, where intelligence and judiciary committees are regularly briefed about intelligence collection programs. Select groups of congressmen also receive briefings on specific operation types prior to their occurrence, he said. \u201cThis preserves executive freedom while also ensuring a check on executive overreach,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cFurthermore, all members of the House and Senate intelligence committees and their key staffers are regularly provided with extended footage of completed operations involving, for example, drone strikes. These provisions should be adopted in Australia.\u201d Many questions remain about the Witness K and Collaery affair, not least about Alexander Downer, the former foreign affairs minister who went on to work for Woodside as a consultant after leaving office. Patrick, the crossbench senator, used parliamentary privilege earlier this year to highlight Downer and Woodside\u2019s role in the Timor Sea negotiations. \u201cThe bottom line here is that Downer (and Woodside) wanted to force East Timor, one of the poorest countries in the world, to surrender most of the revenues from Greater Sunrise, revenue it could have used to deal with its infant mortality rate \u2013 currently 45 out of 1,000 children in East Timor don\u2019t live past the age of one,\u201d Patrick told parliament. \u201cAnd yet our plan was to deprive them of oil revenue.\u201d But for all the questions, one thing remains clear for Preston, Collaery\u2019s former law clerk. \u201cWhatever happens from here, the courage they have displayed is already etched into Australian political history,\u201d she says. \u201cFor years to come, Australians, young and old, will learn of the two heroes who revealed the farce of politics in this country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
