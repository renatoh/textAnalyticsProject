But this year investment advisers are warning investors to ignore the message and buy while the market is still relatively low. Last year, the FTSE 100 closed on May 3 at 6,373, and by St Leger day - September 11, date of the Doncaster horse race - had risen to 6,500. This is a gentle upward movement, although the bare statistics hide the huge market swings during that period: by May 23 the market had fallen to a low of 5,994 but rose to a high of 6,835 on September 2. On the first trading day in May 1999 - May 2 - the FTSE 100 was at 6,431 and by mid-September it had fallen to 6,000, apparently proving the sagacity of the saying. The \"sell in May\" adage arose in more leisurely stock market days, when City stockbrokers would abandon market trading for the \"sea son\", including events such as Ascot, Henley, and the Lord's test match. In recent years the saying has been supported by more prosaic events. The end of the tax year, coinciding with the end of the Isa season, sees billions of pounds pour into investment funds by April 5. The flood of money drives up share prices, which then droop in May when the tap is turned off. But this year it didn't quite work that way. The flood of Isa money was more like a trickle, and the stock market weakened throughout the February/March Isa buying season, as confidence was hammered by fears of a US recession. Since then the market has staged a mild recovery from its lows and investment advisers are confident it can be sustained. Donna Bradshaw, director at advisers Fiona Price &amp; Partners says: \"I wish I had a crystal ball but it looks like this year would not be a good time to sell in May. If you invested a few years ago then you are likely to be sitting on losses, and so you should not do anything; and if you invested last year, your losses will be greater and you should definitely not do anything. If you pull out now it will be far harder to make up any shortfall.\" A recent report from Fi delity Investments shows that attempting to time the best day on which to put your money into the stock market is near impossible. Instead it recommends remaining invested to capture the few days that the stock market really climbs. \"We would be the first to admit that if you do time the market accurately, the rewards can be spectacular. For instance, missing the 40 best days in 13 years (that's just three days a year) would have dramatically reduced returns: in the UK if you had been fully invested the whole time between December 1987 to December 2000 in the FTSE Allshare, your investment would have risen by 14.4%, while if you missed the 40 best days, that figure would have been 5.6%. Conversely, if you had missed the worst 40 days over the same period in the same market, your investment would have grown by 23.9%. \"But unless you are extremely lucky, it is almost impossible to time the market in an accurate and consistent manner on a day to day basis. Also, the worst days in the market often arrive very shortly before or after the best. We believe investors can minimise the risks associated with moving in and out of markets by staying fully invested for the long term,\" says a spokesman. Julie Walker, partner at Regency Financial Managment in the West Midlands, agrees. \"I do not consider the \"sell in May and go away\" saying as good advice. In general terms I would suggest that most investors should consider investing in equity backed investments over a medium to long term basis -that is five years or more. In any case, only experienced investors should consider buying and selling on a short term basis.\" Ms Bradshaw stresses that, contrary to investor's instinctive reaction to flee a falling market, now is a good time to buy because stocks are cheap. \"But the main message we want to get across to people is that they should not get stressed out about blips,\" she adds. \"People tend to only look at the negative: for example everyone remembers the October 1987 stock market crash but, in fact, between January and December 1987 the market actually went up by 2%,\" she says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
