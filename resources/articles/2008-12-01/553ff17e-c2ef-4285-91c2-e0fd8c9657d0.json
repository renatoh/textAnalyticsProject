Nine Christmases ago the Wearsiders ushered in Bill Kenwright's reign as Everton chairman on the receiving end of a 5-0 rout and last season Everton heaped rare humiliation on Roy Keane in a 7-1 mauling that went straight to DVD. Yesterday, against a side without a recognised striker and with only one home win all season, Sunderland were at their compliant best once more to launch Ricky Sbragia's tenure as manager in inglorious fashion. It was never this tough as a caretaker. \"I'm pleased to be given the job but I don't feel good about losing like this,\" said the Scot, who was confirmed as Keane's successor on an 18-month contract on Saturday. \"A lot more responsibility will be reflected back on to me now, I know that, but while I'm disappointed we can't let this affect us. The aim is to stay in the Premier League and we are not clear of trouble yet.\" Nor will they be on this form. Everton could not have hand-picked better opponents to improve their measly return at Goodison and David Moyes will ponder where his sixth-placed team could have been but for a return of only 10 points from a possible 30 at home. Their total of 64 in 2008, however, represents Everton's best in a calendar year since winning the league title in 1987. In the absence of Yakubu Ayegbeni, Louis Saha, James Vaughan and Victor Anichebe, who returned as a late substitute, set pieces have gained in importance for Everton and were the source of victory for the third time in four matches. Sbragia's full-time debut unfolded promisingly for nine minutes until Mikel Arteta executed his first free-kick. Kieran Richardson, required at left-back in a defence diminished by injury and a virus that sidelined Anton Ferdinand before kick-off, set a pattern for needless free-kicks in front of the Sunderland goal with a careless lunge on Leon Osman. Arteta's response contained both power and precision and with the Spaniard finding a gap in the wall between Kenwyne Jones and Richardson the Sunderland keeper, Marton Fulop, could only palm the ball into his net. Everton revelled in the comfort of their early lead. Leighton Baines and Steven Pienaar struck up a productive rapport down the left, Phil Neville impressed in a holding midfield role and Phil Jagielka quashed what little adventure was offered by the isolated Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and Kenwyne Jones. Marouane Fellaini almost capitalised on a mix-up between Fulop and Danny Collins before Arteta again struck from a free-kick to set Everton on course for their first home win since 1 November. This time Steed Malbranque was at fault with a trip on Pienaar and, after his first effort struck the wall, Arteta volleyed the rebound beyond Fulop with the aid of a generous deflection off Teemu Tainio. \"We spoke about not giving any free-kicks away around the box and then we gave them two early on,\" said Sbragia. \"We didn't do ourselves justice. We were second best all over.\" Carlos Edwards forced Tim Howard into his one and only save of the contest at the start of the second half but, despite the improvement in effort from Sunderland, Everton's right to victory was never challenged. With seven minutes remaining Dan Gosling, an 18-year-old midfielder signed from Plymouth Argyle in January, marked his second league appearance for Everton with a tap-in from Joleon Lescott's cross. \"The lads all gave him a standing ovation when he came into the dressing room afterwards,\" revealed Everton's assistant manager, Steve Round.
