Over that time, an unnerving amount has changed, in the medium itself, in the way it's written about and how that writing is itself consumed. The web has challenged the one-party state of media and publishing; independent film-makers can distribute their own films online, and the closed shop of criticism is now an open shop. A new army of bloggers has challenged and reinvigorated movie writing. Film critics have to realise that they themselves are eligible for criticism, and must raise and change their game. Other things have changed, too. Without any formal announcement or obituary, the VHS cassette suddenly went the way of the 78rpm record, and the boxy non-plasma screen TV. How ancient and utterly obsolete they look in charity shops and jumble sales, and yet I have an affectionate regard for the humble videocassette. If it got a speck of dust on its tape, the VHS cassette, that Stakhanovite worker, ploughed on, doggedly providing onscreen entertainment. But get a speck of dust on a DVD, and that disc turns into a petulant drama queen, neurotically freezing up five minutes from the end of the film and refusing to play, very possibly for ever. We all expected DVDs to be utterly replaced by Blu-Ray by now. Mysteriously, it hasn't happened, but the inexorable advance of downloads means that DVDs aren't the business engine they once were. My own movie-going life has changed. I still go to the cinema as a paying punter, occasionally, not as much as I used to, but that has something to do with having relatively recently become a parent. \"We never go to the cinema now that we've had kids!\" complain my friends. \"Mmm, I know exactly what you mean,\" I nod, sympathetically, to their bafflement. There's something I miss about not being, in Liz Hurley's phrase, a \"civilian\" in the world of film-going. And that is the eroticism of deferred consumer pleasure \u2013 the experience of repeatedly noticing a film's existence before actually going to see it, and allowing these moments of recognition to grow and become more frequent as the intention to see the film becomes a reality. Before actually getting paid to write about cinema, I might see an interview with a film's star in a magazine; I might see TV spots; I might read reviews; I might see trailers in the cinema (another much-missed pleasure) and then buy a ticket. This crescendo of noticing and deciding was an important part of the event, a crucially participatory experience that seeing the movie did not offer. A film critic sees the film straight away, before everyone else, before it has an encrustation of media-comment, before any of this is possible. A delicious luxury of course, but not the same. There is one thing, though, that never ceases to thrill. Some people hate watching films in the daytime, and some love it for the bunking-off-school feeling of naughtiness. I am in the second category. And there's an extra-special thrill for the film reviewer: going to see a film in the morning. At 10.30, or even earlier. It feels illegal, immoral and absolutely brilliant. Short of actually drinking a pint of absinthe and smoking one of Lord Henry Wootton's opium-flavoured cigarettes in the cinema foyer, it couldn't be more decadent. I feel sure this less\u2011than\u2011innocent pleasure will never pall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
