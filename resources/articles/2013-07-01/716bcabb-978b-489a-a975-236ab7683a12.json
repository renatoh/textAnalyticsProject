All previously anticipated news conferences for the night have not happened yet and appear to be off \u2013 unless they come back on. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of the Egyptian military, delivered a statement in which he said that \"political forces\" have 48 hours to meet the \"people's demands\" or else the army would impose a road map for the national politics. An hour later, five military helicopters trailing giant national flags flew in broad circles over Cairo. Is it a coup? \u2022 In celebration of the announcement, millions of Egyptians entered the streets, where thousands remained from Sunday's major protests against president Mohamed Morsi on the anniversary of his inauguration. The understanding of the rallying crowds appeared to be that the army statement signaled that Morsi is on his way out. A Morsi aide told the Guardian that Sisi's ultimatum was \"a military coup.\" \u2022 The army denied that it was mounting a coup, insisting that it was instead seeking to stop Egypt from entering a \"dark tunnel of conflict.\" The opposition National Salvation Front also said that the army ultimatum was not a coup. The NSF endorsed the army's explanation of its action as a defense of the will of the people. Finally, late in the day the Muslim Brotherhood said the army action was not a coup but a security measure. \u2022 The headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo were looted and burned overnight, in violence that was part of larger clashes that killed at least 16 people and injured more than 780, according to health ministry figures. A home belonging to Muslim Brotherhood deputy Khairat al-Shater was also reportedly attacked. \u2022 The future of the Morsi government is unclear. At least five cabinet ministers and Morsi's main liaison officer to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces resigned Monday. Millions vowed to stay in the streets until the 48-hour deadline had passed. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, has spoken with General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Reuters reports, citing US defense officials. No details of the conversation were provided. So far the Brotherhood, the opposition and the army have all denied that what is happening in Egypt is a coup (a Morsi aide went off script with the Guardian's Patrick Kingsley earlier today, saying the 48-hour ultimatum is tantamount to \"a military coup\"). Now the army has proposed one further explanation for why this isn't a coup: the rules of the army don't allow coups: The link goes to Ahram online, a state media organ: Egyptian Armed Forces spokesman Ahmed Ali issued a statement on Facebook on Monday stating that Egyptian military doctrine did not allow for \"military coups.\" Egyptian Armed Forces' doctrines do not include military coups as a policy. The armed forces already deployed on Egypt's streets in 1977, 1987 and 2011 and this did not lead to a coup, but rather [led the army] to stand with the will of the great Egyptian people and their desire for reform and change. Tom Gara of the Wall Street Journal, who used to live and report in Egypt, flags a tweet by the former spokesman for Ahmed Shafiq, the former Mubarak crony and presidential candidate. Ahmad Sarhan describes a roadmap for Egypt that has only the installation of a functioning parliament to complete. A mild Twitter fight ensues between the two, if you find that sort of thing entertaining. Now the Muslim Brotherhood joins the army and the opposition in saying the military ultimatum is not a coup. Everyone agrees, then? The opposition National Salvation Front has echoed an army statement asserting that the 48-hour ultimatum is not a coup, Reuters reports: Egypt's main opposition bloc said on Monday an army statement which gave feuding politicians 48 hours to compromise did not reflect a desire by the military to take power. The ultimatum, which said the army would impose its own road map if the government and opposition failed to resolve the country's political crisis, showed that the army respected the \"principles of democracy and the will of the nation as a source of power\", the National Salvation Front said in a statement. The group of liberals and leftists, which counts Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei among its leaders, called on Egyptians to continue peaceful protests across the country. The army has issued a statement denying that Sisi's ultimatum amounted to a military coup and saying Sisi's aim was only to push politicians to reach consensus, Reuters reports: Denying any political ambitions for itself, the military said it was responding to the \"pulse of the Egyptian street\" in issuing an ultimatum to political leaders to unite after mass rallies on Sunday against President Mohamed Mursi. So the ultimatum was just a polite nudge. The Guardian's Patrick Kingsley in Cairo reports that as the night wears on, Morsi's \"position seems ever more untenable, with the Ministry of the Interior announcing its 'complete solidarity' with Egypt's armed forces, and the army taking control of local government headquarters in Fayoum, a governorship south of Cairo.\" Meanwhile an army spokesman denied it was capable of a military coup, saying that it only acted in the will of the people, Patrick reports. (with thanks to Ali Usman in London) A pop-up site counts downs the \"time remaining until the next military coup in Egypt.\" Via the New York Times' Liam Stack: \"Anytime soon\": Reuters has published a more complete transcript of General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's statement this afternoon: \"Egypt and the entire world witnessed protests yesterday by the great Egyptian people, expressing their views and their will in a peaceful, civil and unprecedented manner. Everyone saw the movement of the Egyptian people and listened to their voice with respect and interest. It is essential that the people's action and demands receive a response from all parties which bear some measure of responsibility in this dangerous environment for the nation. \"The Egyptian armed forces, as a principle component of the future equation, and based on its national and historic responsibility to protect the security and welfare of this nation, affirms the following: \"The armed forces will not take part in the political or governing arena and is against exceeding the role accorded to it by genuine democratic principles rooted in the will of the people; \"The security of the nation faces real dangers from the recent developments in the country, which places responsibilities on all of us, each according to their roles, and to what is necessary to fend off these risks. \"The armed forces were quick to realise the danger of the current situation as well as the demands of the great Egyptian people. That is why it set a one-week ultimatum for all political forces to reach consensus and pull out of the crisis. But that week has passed without any initiative or action. This is what led the people to persevere and independently take to the streets in an impressive way, which has drawn admiration and attention domestically, regionally and internationally. \"Wasting more time will only lead to more divisions and strife, of which we have been warning and continue to warn. \"The people have suffered and have found no one to give them care and kindness, and this presents a moral and psychological burden for the armed forces, which concludes that everyone should stop doing anything other than embracing the proud people, who have proven their readiness to do the impossible, if they feel loyalty and dedication toward them. \"The armed forces repeat their call to respond to the people's demands and gives everyone a 48-hour deadline to carry the burden of these historic circumstances that the nation is going through. It will not forgive or tolerate any shortcomings in bearing their responsibilities. \"The armed forces warns everyone that if the demands of the people are not met during this set time period, it will be obliged, due to its national and historic duties, out of respect for the demands of the great Egyptian people, to announce a roadmap and measures for the future, which it would oversee in collaboration with all the loyal national factions and movements, including the youth who were and remain the spark of the glorious revolution. No one would be ignored. \"A salute of appreciation and fondness to the faithful and loyal men of the armed forces, who bore and continue to bear their national responsibility toward the great Egyptian people with all determination, perseverance and pride. \"God protect Egypt and its great proud people\" Guardian Middle East editor Ian Black writes that the army ultimatum \"was a stark reminder that for all the drama, sacrifices and high-flown aspirations of the Egyptian revolution, the army remains the ultimate arbiter of power\": Critics will be quick to conjure up the spectre of Algeria in 1991 when the generals stepped in to cancel a second round of elections an Islamist party had been poised to win. The difference is that Egypt has had its election \u2013 won by the Brotherhood. The fear now, perhaps being deliberately exaggerated in a dangerously charged and polarised atmosphere, is that Algerian levels of violence will follow. The Brotherhood's anger at this move reflects a sense that they have been outmanoeuvred by the soldiers they thought they had neutralised. Only last summer the newly elected Morsi won plaudits for moving swiftly and effectively against the Mubarak-era commanders of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf) \u2013 and appointed Sisi to underline civilian control over the army. Still, the two sides have maintained a partnership of sorts in the long and messy transition to Egypt's rickety and dysfunctional democracy. The army is ideologically aligned with the secular opposition but the Brotherhood remains the most organised civilian body in the country \u2013 a legacy of the authoritarian decades of stunted political life and rigged elections. And the army has managed to maintain its privileges and huge economic interests as well as its strategically vital relationship with the US military and the Pentagon. Monday's comments by President Barack Obama sounded distinctly approving of its intervention. Read the full piece here. Misgivings. Asraf Khalil, based in Cairo, has written for Time and Foreign Policy. HA Hellyer is with the Brookings Institution. Hafsa Halawa worked for the National Democratic Institute in Egypt, outlawed by Morsi. For activist secular democratic opponents of a military regime, Hellyer notes, 1 July 2013 is as complicated as 25 January 2011. Egyptian fiction writer Ahdaf Soueif writes in Comment is Free \u2013 published moments ago \u2013 that president Morsi has broken his promise to Egypt by continuing to use violence against the opposition and not seeking to repair broken state institutions. It's time for Morsi to go, Soueif writes: The Brotherhood says that when Egyptians elected Morsi, they entered into an unbreakable contract to keep him for four years. The protesters say he was elected on a stated commitment to the goals of the revolution and promises he made, and that he's broken every one of those. So Morsi has broken his contract with the electorate. ...Is this a coup? If it is, it seems to be reluctantly mounted. Sisi's statement is clear: the military does not want to rule. But he is wooing the people; he makes a point of praising their self-empowerment, and as I write six military helicopters flying Egyptian flags circle over my house. ...People want to believe the military has learned its lesson and doesn't want to rule; that the \"bad\" people are no longer in Scaf; and that the army chief, General al-Sisi, will oversee another set of elections. The revolutionaries are working hard to point out that this phase is not against Morsi and the Brotherhood as such, but against the continuation of the policies that marked the Mubarak era. Without radical change, these policies will carry on under the next president \u2013 be he army-appointed or otherwise. But the people want to get rid of Morsi first and deal with the rest later. Read the full piece here. Another shot of that Tahrir crowd: The Egyptian Brotherhood's Twitter announces a statement to be issued \"shortly\": The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party has released a statement denying that Khairat al-Shater's bodyguards had been arrested, despite earlier reports. The FJP posted a statement on its Facebook page denying that the bodyguards had been arrested, Reuters reports: It quoted Shater as saying officers arrived in three police cars, broke into his residence, and \"concocted\" a fight with young men in the area. Heavy shooting ensued and his personal driver was kidnapped, the statement said. \"The situation is now calm after the arrival of dozens of Brotherhood youth to defend us,\" he was quoted as saying. Earlier, security sources quoted by Reuters said the guards for Shater, the Brotherhood's number-two figure, had been taken into custody. Al-Masry al-youm, in a report flagged and translated by Egypt Independent, says that Sami Anan, deputy chair of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, has \"reigned from his current position as military adviser to President Mohamed Morsi\": He did so in solidarity with the masses opposing the president and his policies, which he characterized as oppressive and tyrannical. Anan called on the \u201cbrave Egyptian armed forces\u201d to show once again that they are a model of sacrifice and patriotism by siding with the will of the people and their legitimate demands. Cairo reporter Samer al-Atrush has separately reported that Anan has floated the idea of standing for the presidency. It was reported earlier that up to five ministers had resigned from Morsi's cabinet. Via Michele Dunne of the Atlantic Council: The anti-Morsi protests in Tahrir Square, Alexandria and elsewhere appear to be huge even by Egyptian revolutionary standards. OnTv is livestreaming here and tweets pictures of various rallies. Here's the scene in Tahrir from about a half hour ago: There are also large crowds outside the presidential palace in Cairo. A picture of a rally in Alexandria is here and in Luxor here and in Suez here and a report on pro-military chants at a rally in Port Said here. There are pro-Morsi gatherings as well, including in Rabaa in southern Cairo: A Morsi aide has called the ultimatum \"a military coup,\" the Guardian's Patrick Kingsley reports from Cairo: The presidency indicated that it viewed the statement as a coup d'etat, and implied that Morsi was safe as long as his administration still had US support. \"Obviously we feel this is a military coup,\" a presidential aide said. \"But the conviction within the presidency is that [the coup] won't be able to move forward without American approval.\" The aide's comments implied that the presidency was hopeful of continued American support. They also suggested the presidency was banking on the likelihood that the military would not risk upsetting America, which provides it with significant funding. The US ambassador to Egypt has spent recent days trying to persuade opposition figures to engage in dialogue with Morsi instead of supporting protests. Read the full piece here.

Please share your eyewitness accounts or information that will help us document the situation \u2013 images, video or text. You can submit material here. A countdown clock appears on Egyptian TV. It appears to be winding down toward about 4pm local time Wednesday. It's currently just past 7.30pm in Cairo. Here's video of military helicopters trailing national flags over Cairo. How long did it take to rig them? The helicopters appeared about an hour after this afternoon's announcement by the army of a 48-hour \"ultimatum\" for \"political forces\" to meet the \"people's demands.\" (via @evanchill) After the reported arrest of 15 bodyguards of Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater, and the destruction overnight of Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo, a house belonging to Shater has reportedly been attacked: The New York Times' Liam Stack links to video posted to the YouTube account of Saad al-Shater, a son, purporting to show internal security forces firing on the home, although as Stack points out there's no audible or visible gunfire: Amr Moussa, the former presidential candidate and Arab League chief, has welcomed the army's statement, Reuters reports: Former Egyptian presidential candidate Amr Moussa welcomed an army statement on Monday giving rival politicians 48 hours to resolve the country's standoff, saying it reflected the will of the people. \"Wasting more time will make things worse. The invitation to meet the demands of the people within the next few hours is a historical opportunity which should not be lost,\" Moussa, a liberal politician and former foreign minister, said in a statement. Many journalists at the scene are reporting jubilation in Tahrir Square at the appearance of helicopters flying the national flag, and the return of the anti-regime chant \"the people and the army are one hand\": The protest movement that brought down Mubarak, however, harbors deep antipathy for military rule, and the seeming embrace of the military by crowds in the streets this evening has been met with disbelief... and then disbelief at the disbelief, as the debate over what the 48-hour deadline and the Brotherhood arrests and helicopters towing flags portend: The Washington Post's Max Fisher links to two translations of the full army statement. Here's a translation by NPR: Armed Forces asserts the following: The Armed Forces will not take part in the policy making and will not accept a role outside of the democratic framework set by the people. The nation\u2019s national security is under threat following the latest developments, each side should exhibit responsibility. The Armed Forces had previously expected this instability, had given a week for the various forces to reach consensus and end the crisis, but this week passed with no action, which led the people to go on the streets, to express their freedom in a manner that impressed the local and international community. Wasting more time will not result except in more polarization and conflict. The people of Egypt have suffered for so long with no one to save them. Accordingly, the Armed Forces feels obligated to embrace the will of the people who proved they are able to do the impossible. The Armed Forces renews its call and give the political forces a 48 hour ultimatum as a last chance to carry the burdens of this historic situation that the nation is going through. The Armed Forces calls upon everyone that if the people\u2019s demands aren\u2019t set within the timeframe, based on its historic and national obligation it will have to declare a roadmap and procedures that oversee to include all mainstreams including the youth who started this glorious revolution without excluding anyone. An hour after giving the civilian leadership two days to broker an unspecified deal, the Egyptian military flies helicopters over the capital hauling national flags: Security forces have arrested 15 bodyguards of Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater \"after an exchange of fire in which no one was injured,\" Reuters reports based on \"security sources\": Shater's family telephoned Al Jazeera television station to report that his home was under police attack. The sources said security forces were involved in an exchange of fire with the guards after going to arrest them for alleged unlawful possession of firearms. Shater's whereabouts were not immediately known. He is widely regarded as the strongest personality in the Islamist movement, but who was barred from running for president last year because he had been jailed under toppled ex-President Hosni Mubarak's authoritian rule. A senior Muslim Brotherhood politician has said no state institution will stage a coup against Morsi and warned against misinterpreting the army's statement. Yasser Hamza, leader of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, of which Morsi is the former leader, said: For an institution of state to come and stage a coup against the president, this will not happen. Any force that goes against the constitution is a call for sabotage and anarchy. Reuters has just sent a \"snap\" stating that the Egyptian protesters welcome the army's statement and have vowed to continue protesting to force Morsi out. My colleague Mona Mahmood sends this translation of the key paragraphs of the army's statement: The armed forces repeat their call for meeting the people's demands and grant 48 hours as a deadline and last chance to shoulder the responsibility of this historical event, for a nation, Egypt, which will not forgive any shortcomings in taking responsibility by any forces. The armed forces are saying to all sides, if the people's demands are not met within the deadline, the armed forces would be obliged in accordance with their national and historical responsibilities and in respect of the demands of the great Egyptian people, to declare a road map and procedures, the implementation of which will be supervised by the armed forces with the participation of all sincere national parties, including the young men who were and still are igniting the glorious revolution and without ousting anyone. Ahram Online has also translated some of the Egyptian Army's statement: The Egyptian armed forces will not become involved in politics or administration; they are satisfied with their role as is spelt out in line with democratic norms ... The Egyptian armed forces have set a deadline, which ended yesterday [Sunday], for all political powers to reconcile and end the current crisis, but no progress has been made. Consequently, the Egyptian people have taken to the streets ... Wasting more time will mean more division and conflict, which is what the armed forces warned of and of which it continues to warn ... \"The armed forces reiterates its call that the demands of the people be met,\" the statement read, according to Ahram, giving political factions a 48-hour period \"as a last chance to bear the historical burden that the nation is currently facing\". The Associated Press has also been translating the Egyptian army's statement. The armed forces repeat their call for the people's demands to be met and give everyone 48 hours as a last chance to shoulder the burden of a historic moment for a nation that will not forgive or tolerate any party that is lax in shouldering its responsibility. The news agency says Morsi and the protesters must reach an agreement to \"meet the people's demands\" or the army would intervene and put forward a \"road map\". It did not define the people's demands, but said if they were not realised the military would be obliged to \"announce a road map for the future and the steps for overseeing its implementation, with participation of all patriotic and sincere parties and movements\". The statement described yesterday's protests as \"glorious\" and said protesters expressed their opinion in a \"peaceful and civilised manner\", adding that \"it is necessary that the people get a reply ... to their calls\". The military underlined it will \"not be a party in politics or rule\". But it said it had a responsibility to act because Egypt's national security was facing a \"grave danger\". Reuters has translated part of the Egyptian army's statement: If the demands of the people are not realised within the defined period, it will be incumbent upon [the armed forces] ... to announce a road map for the future. The people had expressed their will with unprecedented clarity in the mass demonstrations and wasting more time would only increase the danger of division and violence, the statement in the name of army chief-of-staff General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said. The army would oversee the implementation of the road map it sought \"with the participation of all factions and national parties, including young people\", but it would not get directly involved in politics or government, the statement said. Barack Obama has been speaking about the situation in Egypt. The US president called on all sides to \"step back from maximalist positions\" and not to resolve their disputes \"in a violent fashion\". He also referred to reports of sexual assaults in Tahrir Square, saying: \"Assaulting women does not qualify as peaceful protest.\" The army's statement is being seen by some as the warning of a coup d'etat. Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, is alarmed: But analyst Michael Hanna says the army doesn't want to take power again. The head of the army, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has given Egypt's leaders another 48 hours to meet the demands of the country, in another ambiguous warning that is open to mixed interpretations. Sisi called on politicians to agree an \"inclusive road map\". An Arabic version of the statement has been published on Facebook. Here's a summary of the main events in Egypt today: \u2022 Up to five ministers from Mohamed Morsi's government have resigned after millions of people took to the streets on Sunday to demand the president's departure. There were unconfirmed reports that the ministers resigned in sympathy with the protests. \u2022 The headquarters of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood have been burned and ransacked. Around 50 anti-Brotherhood protesters spent the night attacking the compound \u2013 situated on a rocky, isolated outcrop in east Cairo \u2013 with molotov cocktails, causing a series of small fires and explosions. With police nowhere to be seen, Brotherhood cadres returned fire, killing at least four, and injuring at least 80 \u2013 according to medics at the scene. \u2022 The army's leadership is due to make a statement about the political situation. The Muslim Brotherhood criticised the failure of the police to stop the attacks on its offices. It said it was considering action to defend itself. \u2022 The ministry of health said 16 people were killed and almost 800 injured in violent clashes that followed huge and largely peaceful protests on Sunday. Millions took the streets in protests across the country including up to 500,000 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The Egyptian military is expected to make a statement soon, according to the Egypt Independent. Last week, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the defence minister and head of the army, said he would not allow Egypt to descend into \"a dark tunnel of conflict\". In ambiguous remarks, he said: \"There is a state of division in society and the continuation of it is a danger to the Egyptian state and there must be consensus among all.\" The organisers of Sunday's protests have given Morsi until Tuesday afternoon to step down or else it will hike up its campaign, AP reports. The ultimatum issued Monday by Tamarod, the protest organisers, increases pressure on Morsi a day after the opposition's massive show of force on the streets. The main rallies in Cairo were largely peaceful, but deadly violence broke out in several parts of the country, often when marchers came under gunfire, apparently from Islamists. At least 16 people were killed and more than 780 injured, Health Ministry spokesman Yehya Moussa told state television. Tamarod, Arabic for \"Rebel,\" issued a statement giving Morsi until 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday to step down and pave the way for early presidential elections or else it would bring the crowds back out, march on more palaces and launch \"complete civil disobedience.\" Protesters were already gearing up for new rallies Monday. The group also called on the powerful military and the police to clearly state their support for the protesters. The anti-harassment group, OpAntiSH, reported 46 instance of sexual assault during Sunday's protests, Ahram Online reports. \"There [were] men with sticks at the entrance of the metro station across from KFC in Tahrir who are attacking women,\" reports OpAntiSH, a volunteer group that works to combat sexual violence in protests within the square's perimeter in downtown Cairo. Sexual harassment, mainly in the form of mob assaults, has become an issue that plagues Tahrir Square during political protests. OpAntiSH asks any volunteers to join them on Monday, since protests are expected to continue. How many other assaults went unreported? asks Carrol Bogert from Human Rights Watch. Analysts reckon Morsi's time could be up. The respected Egypt watcher Michael Hanna, senior fellow at the Century Foundation thinktank, says the president is in deep trouble following reports of the resignations from his cabinet. Hanna points out the political allegiance in Egypt is fickle. Prominent anti-government activist Mahmoud Salem, who blogs under the name Sandmonkey, puts it like this: HA Hellyer from the Brookings Institution also doubts Morsi's chances of survival. Al-Watan provides a video tour of the ransacked, and still burning, Cairo headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Protesters are filmed carrying away electrical equipment, furniture, and piles of documents. (Hat Tip Liam Stack). The names of four ministers said to have resigned have been confirmed by Reuters, but the reason for their departure remains unclear at this stage. \"Four ministers presented their resignations today,\" said a cabinet official, who asked not to be named. He gave no reason but the state news agency had earlier said the ministers were considering resigning in sympathy with the protesters. The four were Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou, Communication and Information Technology Atef Helmi, Minister of State for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hatem Bagato and Minister of State for Environmental Affairs Khaled Abdel-Aal. Egypt's ruling Muslim Brotherhood says the armed men who ransacked its national headquarters had crossed a red line of violence, and the movement was considering action to defend itself, Reuters reports. Gehad El-Haddad, spokesman of the Islamist movement, told Reuters in a telephone interview that Egyptians would not sit by and tolerate attacks on their institutions. \"It's very dangerous for one entity in society to take up violence as a means of change because it may entice others to do so. The Muslim Brotherhood is a disciplined organization,\" he said, criticising the security forces for failing to protect the headquarters in Sunday's attack. Haddad referred to the creation of people's self-defence committees during the 2011 uprising that overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak. Asked whether the Brotherhood was calling for a similar move now, he said the movement's Guidance Bureau was in session and would make an announcement at a news conference later on Monday. \"The people will not sit silent,\" the spokesman said. The Twitter feed of the Brotherhood added: There are reports that a number of ministers have resigned from Morsi's government. The news agency Mena said five ministers have quit. The Egypt Independent says they include Hatem Begato, legal and parliamentary affairs minister; and Atef Helmy, minister of communication. Broadcast journalist May Kamel said they resigned in solidarity with the protesters. Reuters and AFP say only four ministers have resigned. The ransacking of the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters was reminiscent of the sacking of Hosni Mubarak's political headquarters during Egypt's 2011 uprising, writes Patrick Kingsley in Cairo Around 50 anti-Brotherhood activists spent the night attacking the compound with petrol bombs causing a series of small fires and explosions. With police nowhere to be seen, Brotherhood cadres returned fire, killing at least four of the besiegers, and injuring at least 80 \u2013 according to medics at the scene. \"It's a great feeling. I've wanted to do this for three years,\" said Ahmed Yassin, a student from Alexandria, holding the prized office name-tag of Mohamed el-Badie, the Brotherhood's leader. \"Their offices are being trashed all over Egypt \u2013 but this was the most important, because they are running the country from this office,\" he said. Opponents of the Brotherhood detest the organisation because it is perceived to unduly influenced by Morsi, a Brotherhood associate, and because it seeks to impose too narrow a vision of Islam on Egyptian society. Both sides told the Guardian that the other had started the battle, which began at around 7pm on Sunday. It was impossible to verify either claim. At roughly 7am, after 12 hours of fighting, Brotherhood reinforcements arrived \u2013 possibly, bystanders said, because one of the fires had grown too big, and those inside now feared being smoked out. The reinforcements covered their colleagues' exit with live fire \u2013 later seen being plucked from the wall by the Guardian. Bystanders said that some Brotherhood members were injured and handed to the authorities during the blaze. Once the other Brothers had fled, protesters stormed the compounded, and accelerated the blaze. Firefighters said they arrived at 9am \u2013 too late to save the building, which is now charred and still filled with smoke. Once the worst of the fire was put out, hundreds reentered the building, looting and destroying its remaining features. The Guardian saw men and women taking away air-conditioning units, safes, sinks, and filing cabinets \u2013 as well as the copper nametags of Khairat al-Shater, the Brotherhood's most powerful figure, and Mohamed el-Badie, its nominal leader. Inside, there was chaos, with black smoke still billowing through the upper rooms, and looters fighting over the spoils. Outside, a crowd of 200 chanted \"the people demand the fall of the regime\" indicative of the view that the Brotherhood has seized control of most of the state. The Brotherhood themselves believe that thoug Morsi is a Muslim Brother, the state is still controlled by officials loyal to ousted dictator Hosni Mubarak. The scene at their headquarters was a microcosm of the extreme polarisation affecting Egyptian society, which is divided between those who may be religious, but do not seek an Islamic state \u2013 and Islamists like the Brotherhood, who seek to use the concepts of Islamic law to govern Egypt. Even state institutions appear to have been drawn into the polarisation. The police, who defended the same building during a similar attack in March, failed to intervene on Sunday. \"I feel victorious,\" said Ahmed Badawy, a local resident shot through the hand by birdshot fired by Brotherhood members during the night. \"But we'll only have truly won once Morsi leaves.\" Millions took to the street against Morsi on Sunday \u2013 in scenes reminiscent of the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. Unlike in 2011, the president still had supporters prepared to gather on mass in his support. Over 100,000 Islamists have rallied in recent days in east Cairo in defence of Morsi's democratic mandate. But in Moqattam, the consensus was that Islamists did not represent Egypt. \"The important thing is for the people at the Islamist sit-in in east Cairo that they are only a small part of this country,\" said Ahmed Yassin, holding the Brotherhood leader's name tag. Additional reporting by Mowaffaq Safadi \"The Muslim Brotherhood is dead,\" says the respected academic Khaled Fahmy, professor of history at the American University in Cairo. Writing on Facebook he sayd: It is a very tragic death as it happens paradoxically just when they thought that the future is theirs. Their best days are already behind them. And what makes it even more difficult for them to accept this tragic end is that it was brought about not because of the clever tactics or the insightful leadership of the opposition, as much as it was the result of their own bullheaded, stubborn leadership that, in the words of my dear friend Sherif Younis, had caused them to win all the battles but lose the war. Fahmy identifies what he calls the movement's seven deadly sins, including its failure to reform the security services and its fundamentally undemocratic nature. The Muslim Brotherhood has complained about the time it took for the police to respond to attacks against its offices. Last night it's spokesman Gehad El-Haddad criticised the police for failing to intervene. Patrick Kingsley notes the apparent change in police tactics. The police are in open revolt against Morsi, according to the New York Times: In anticipation of Sunday\u2019s protests, the interior minister had already announced that the police would not protect the offices of the Muslim Brotherhood from attack. And when the protests began, police officers were almost nowhere to be found. Several officers in uniform joined the protesters in Tahrir Square calling for Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster and asking the military to intervene. Two officers were seen in the vicinity of the attack on the Brotherhood\u2019s headquarters talking on hand-held radios, but they did nothing to intervene. The paper's Cairo correspondent David Kirkpatrick tweets video of police protesting on Sunday. The death toll from Sunday's violence has risen to 16 according to the health ministry, the Egypt Independent and others report. The independent press in Egypt is in no doubt about the significance of the scale yesterday's demo. Basil Dabh, a reporter with the Daily News, tweets his paper's front page: Democracy Now's Sharif Kouddous translates and tweets the front page of al-Shorouk. Only the state-run papers are still backing Morsi, al-Jazeera's Rawya Rageh notes.

Channel 4's Jonanthan Rugman quips The Muslim Brotherhood's HQ has been looted and burned, Patrick Kingsley reports from inside the building where he saw one protester holding up the sign to Khariat al-Shater's office. We decided to switch to live coverage of Egypt after reports that the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters in Cairo has been overrun by anti-government protesters. The Guardian's Patrick Kingsley is at the scene and will have a report soon. In the meantime, here's an account by Reuters. The headquarters of Egypt's ruling Muslim Brotherhood was overrun by youths who ransacked the building after those inside were evacuated on Monday following a night of violence that killed at least seven people. By far the bloodiest incident of Sunday's mammoth and mostly peaceful protests against the Brotherhood and President Mohamed Morsi, it began after dark and continued for hours, with guards inside firing on youths hurling fire bombs and rocks. A spokesman for the Brotherhood blamed the violence on \"thugs\" and said it would be demanding answers from police who failed to protect it. He said two of those inside were injured - by fires - before a security detail from the movement was able to evacuate all those inside the compound in mid-morning. The violence will likely add to a sense among Brotherhood members, long oppressed under Hosni Mubarak, that they face a political siege since being elected last year, which they blame on liberal opponents and loyalists of the old regime. Images of the four-storey suburban building, its walls scorched, windows smashed and looters making off with office furniture, recalled those of the destruction of the state security headquarters when Mubarak was toppled in 2011. The Brotherhood had fortified the headquarter's walls in the run up to the protests.

Here's a roundup of the latest news: Egypt \u2022 Egypt is locked in a tense standoff after millions of protesters took to the streets across the country demanding the resignation of Mohamed Morsi with some militants set the ruling Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters on fire. After dawn on Monday, young men were still preventing traffic entering Tahrir Square but only hundreds of people remained, some resting under makeshift awnings, Reuters reports. \u2022 Up to 500,000 protesters filled Cairo's Tahrir Square on Sunday. Security sources said that at least seven people were killed and more than 600 wounded in clashes between Morsi's supporters and opponents. Follow how the day unfolded in Sunday's Middle East Live. \u2022 In an interview with the Guardian over the weekend, Morsi dismissed calls for his removal. He said: If we changed someone in office who [was elected] according to constitutional legitimacy \u2013 well, there will people or opponents opposing the new president too, and a week or a month later, they will ask him to step down. There is no room for any talk against this constitutional legitimacy. \u2022 Trying to topple a democratically elected president amid widespread civil unrest invites the intervention of the army, argues a Guardian editorial. If the army came to power it would stay for a long time. For many Islamists, having taken the democratic route but been denied the chance to see their leaders govern, opposition would not be a question of ideology but a matter of personal survival. What would prevent them from concluding that a future of arrest, torture and imprisonment awaits, a return to what they experienced under Mubarak? What would stop the ranks of extremists on both sides swelling? Syria \u2022 Government forces have pounded Sunni Muslim rebels in the central city of Homs with artillery and from the air on Sunday, the second day of an offensive to expand loyalist control over Syria's strategic centre, activists said. They said rebels defending the old centre of Homs and five adjacent Sunni districts had largely repelled a ground attack on Saturday but reported fresh clashes and deaths within the city on Sunday. Saudi Arabia \u2022 Saudi Arabia has sentenced seven activists from its restive Eastern province to prison terms ranging from five to 10 years for posting messages on Facebook calling for anti-government protests, according to Human Rights Watch. The New York-based rights group urged the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and other European officials who were meeting with Gulf counterparts in Manama on Sunday to condemn the convictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
