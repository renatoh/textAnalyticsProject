In an analysis of the annual British Social Attitudes survey, which sampled 1,000 adults between July and November last year, the King's Fund said satisfaction with the NHS had fallen from a record 70% last year to 58%. John Appleby, the fund's chief economist, said the drop could not be attributed to rising expectations or an actual reduction in the quality of NHS service. He said hospital-acquired infection rates had remained stable and larger patient surveys, of two million or more, showed no large change in patient experience. \"It's hard to say that the drop in satisfaction reflects a fall in NHS service quality,\" he said, noting that the BSA found only slight drops in satisfaction with inpatient, outpatient and accident and emergency services. The King's Fund, which took over funding the survey after the coalition stopped commissioning it last year, said the period when it was carried out coincided with a febrile political atmosphere when there was intense negative coverage of the coalition's health reforms. The British Medical Association had stepped up its campaign against the reforms and ministers argued that the NHS \"performed badly on key outcomes such as cancer survival rates \u2026 this was accompanied by strong ministerial rhetoric about bureaucracy\", the thinktank said. The impact was to depress enthusiasm for the NHS, Appleby said. \"It can be seen as an emotional response. I am not blaming the media wholly. You forget that more than one million people work in the NHS and their views on the reforms would have been a potential factor in all this.\" The King's Fund pointed out that the drop in satisfaction was marked in Labour, Tory and Lib Dem voters. While Labour voters would hardly be natural enthusiasts for coalition policies, Appleby pointed to a YouGov poll in February that showed support for the reforms among Tory voters was 45% \u2013 \"not particularly high\" \u2013 and among Lib Dems 17%. \"The run of year-on-year increases in NHS satisfaction had to come to an end at some stage, and it is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze,\" it said. \"Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly. This will be a concern to the government, given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms.\" Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: \"It speaks volumes that the first fall in public satisfaction with the NHS for over a decade came in the first full year of Tory control. It takes a special kind of incompetence to inherit a successful NHS with patient satisfaction at an all-time high and in just two years in government turn it into an organisation demoralised, destabilised and fearful of the future. \"Patients can already see the damage being done to services and staff morale by David Cameron's disastrous decision to reorganise the NHS at a time of financial stress. It is heading back to the bad old days of the 80s and 90s with waiting times, A&amp;E in chaos and patients waiting for hours on trolleys in corridors.\" The government used the results of its own telephone survey run by the pollsters Mori to rebut the findings. The survey has been running since 2000 and ratings have generally been higher than the BSA's. In May it showed 69% were satisfied with the running of the NHS. The health minister Simon Burns said: \"Our latest survey of over 70,000 patients shows that an overwhelming majority \u2013 92% \u2013 say that their overall experience of the NHS was good, very good or excellent. \"The British Social Attitudes survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors. By its nature, it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
