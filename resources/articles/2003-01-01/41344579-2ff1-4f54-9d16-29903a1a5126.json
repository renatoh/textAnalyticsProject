He never made a musical and thus remained silent on the issue of whether it is easier to teach an actor to sing than a singer to act. Ford's admirer and chronicler, Peter Bogdanovich, came a cropper by casting Burt Reynolds and Cybill Shepherd in At Long Last Love (1975), the hubristic musical that began his rapid decline. After 75 years of talking pictures, the question remains moot and, in some cases, (eg Natalie Wood in West Side Story, Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady) mute. Commercial imperatives of course have compelled Hollywood to provide movie vehicles for singing stars with little or no acting experience, and from Bing Crosby through Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley, singers have acquitted themselves well when given the right material and good directors. The Dave Clark Five, whose 'Tottenham Sound' briefly challenged the Beatles' 'Mersey Beat', are now largely remembered because they starred in John Boorman's feature debut, Catch Us if You Can. Rap artists, like opera singers, are engaged in a kind of dramatic performance and have made the transition quite naturally in movies that reflect the conflicts of the black ghettos that inspire their numbers - one thinks of Ice Cube in in Boyz N the Hood and and the late Tupac Shakur in Gridlock'd. The white rapper Eminem (whose nom de guerre is an abbreviation of his real moniker of Marshall Mathers) is fortunate to make his movie debut in 8 Mile. The producer is the ambitious Brian Glazer and its director Curtis Hanson, who has advanced from conventional fare to make the trenchant LA Confidential and Wonder Boys. While no masterpiece, it is infinitely superior to the sad movie debuts of Britney Spears and Mariah Carey. The film was shot in Eminem's native Detroit, the most rundown of America's great cities, in steady decline since the appalling riots of 36 years ago. The title refers to the Eight Mile Road, the perimeter that divides the dangerous, neglected inner city, home to poor whites and deprived blacks where Eminem was reared, from the relatively well-off suburbs where the middle classes reside in closely guarded estates. It is in this urban wasteland of derelict buildings, gang battles, unemployment and general hopelessness that the Beverly Hills Cop movies began before rapidly moving to affluent Los Angeles. Rodrigo Prieto, the brilliant Mexican photographer who shot Amores Perros, turns a remorseless eye on the decaying Detroit where Eminem's character, Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, lives with his feckless, low-life mother (Kim Basinger), her four-year-old daughter, and her seedy lover Greg, a high-school contemporary of Jimmy's. The family's trailer is located in the seedy Eight Mile Road Mobile Court, an indication of both transience and of Jimmy's location between two worlds. Almost everything in the film points towards semi-autobiography: the absent father, the uneasy relationships with a wayward mother, a rejected girlfriend and a new lover; his hanging out with a multiracial crew (presumably forged in high school) dedicated to each other's welfare and, above all, the expressive gifts as a rap performer that arise from his specific social situation the way that the blues came out of slavery and its aftermath, and country music arose from the condition of poor Southern whites. Not an obviously heroic figure, Eminem spends much of his time with a woollen sock drawn over his head and the hood of an anorak pulled over that (the time is winter). He resembles a cross between that most appealing of mixed-up kids, James Dean, and the coolly charismatic Kevin Spacey. He's quiet, deceptively blank, insolent, a concealer rather than a revealer except when it comes to rapping. The film 8 Mile most obviously brings to mind is Saturday Night Fever, a tough movie written by an old-time socialist, Norman Wexler, and resembling in tone and texture Hubert Selby Jr's Last Exit to Brooklyn until it was bowdlerised and reissued in a version that John Travolta's teenybopper fans could see. Eminem's public persona has been somewhat modified for the movie, which goes out of its way to establish his anti-homophobic credentials and his sense of family responsibility. His first song is an improvised lullaby to his little sister; he does little more than wince when his boozy mother shares her problems: 'It's our sex life - Greg won't go down on me.' His occasional wild outbursts are tempered by his readiness to stick at his repetitive dead-end job in a non-union steel-pressing plant. (Coincidentally this is the same job performed by Bj\u00f6rk in Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the last attempt to turn a world-famous singer into a movie star.) But the movie doesn't take him out of this world in a triumphalist, show-biz way. Early on, he dries up at a rapping contest at a hip-hop club overwhelmingly patronised by blacks. Inevitably, he hits his stride in a climatic comeback performance. But he's taken time out from the plant and he returns there to complete the night shift."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
