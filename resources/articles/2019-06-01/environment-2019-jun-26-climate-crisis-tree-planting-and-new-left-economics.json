Inextricably linked to this is the growing ecological crisis. We must not let Brexit derail us from tackling these global challenges head-on. Whatever the outcome of the political uncertainties, we need robust, binding targets for the recovery of Scotland\u2019s natural environment to safeguard both nature and people. This is why we have come together from across Scottish society to ask the first minister to bring forward a new Scottish environment act. Ensuring our world is rich in nature is the best insurance we have against dangerous climate heating. Protecting, restoring and enhancing Scotland\u2019s natural environment would help limit temperature rises and help us adapt to changes that we cannot avoid. It would also give us so much more. Everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment. Nature enriches people\u2019s lives. It cleans our air and water, improves our physical and mental health, underpins Scotland\u2019s global image and exports, and improves the places we live. For all these reasons, we are calling for a Scottish environment act that makes Scotland\u2019s vision to be an environmental world leader a reality.

It ought to be compulsory reading for everyone, especially climate-change deniers. I would love to believe that those who can plant trees will redouble their efforts, and those who cannot will applaud and encourage this lifesaving measure. The feature includes the fact that about 15bn trees are felled every year, dwarfing replacement efforts. Another cause for lament is the possibility of the building of a third runway at Heathrow. Aeroplanes emit carbon dioxide and ozone faster and in greater quantities than road traffic. If we keep launching more and more of these metal monsters into the air, the best tree planters in the world will be unable to compete. Wonderful work in reforestation is at risk of being nullified. Penelope Maclachlan Hanwell, London \u2022 Patrick Barkham\u2019s survey of tree planting oddly made no mention of Ecosia\u2019s search engine, which has so far planted 60m trees from the advertising revenue generated by internet searches made by its 7 million users. It\u2019s worth keeping a Google search engine for the rare occasion when Ecosia doesn\u2019t do the trick, but it\u2019s an effective way of planting trees. Charles Young Oxford \u2022 Would the UK do more to prevent \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d (Report, 26 June) and help poor countries if it diverted some of its aid money to reduce carbon emissions and fossil fuel use at home? If aid were diverted to restore the subsidy to home solar panels in Britain (Home solar panel installations fall by 94% as subsidies cut, the guardian.com, 5 June) would there be more long-term benefit to developing countries that are being harmed by our carbon? I write about Mozambique, which was recently hit by two cyclones made worse by climate change, and which caused huge damage. Mozambique needs money to rebuild, but, unfortunately, if Britain will not increase spending on the climate crisis, it might benefit most if the aid was spent in the UK. Dr Joseph Hanlon London \u2022 I was staggered at the narrowness of vision reflected in Andy Beckett\u2019s piece on new left economics (There is now an alternative, Long read, 25 June). What is it about the global climate and biodiversity crisis that the left doesn\u2019t get? It\u2019s 23.59 for goodness sake \u2013 if the best we can do is some Portakabins in Preston we truly are doomed. Equity and human rights must be at the heart of any sustainable development strategy. Those who will suffer most are those who live on the margins socially and geographically. If the new left economics doesn\u2019t begin by integrating this fact into a truly global perspective, then we need to turn elsewhere.
