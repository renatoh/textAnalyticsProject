Cahill will be Australia\u2019s main point of attack, with Tommy Oar and Mathew Leckie providing support from the wings. Chile will be well aware of Cahill's aerial threat, and the player believes his opponents will try to distract him. \"I know for a fact that they'll have someone, or a few holding and shirt pulling and things like that to put me off my game. But that's no different to what I've had in the past,\" Cahill said. \"It's a competition where a little nudge can change the way you head a ball or the way you attack a ball or even defend a ball. \"So it will be no different to the way we're going to be and for us we're up for every single battle. We're going to stand up and be counted. Hopefully the referees clamp down on it this campaign.\" Chile\u2019s most influential player, the Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal, is set to miss the game with a knee injury but is believed to have trained with his team-mates on Wednesday. Cahill said Australia would concentrate on their own preparations rather than Vidal\u2019s fitness. \"[Saying Vidal is injured] may be a tactical advantage for them, maybe he'll show up on the day and play,\" Cahill said. \"So for us we have to worry about ourselves. Vidal is a player that brings a lot to their team but at the same time, whoever steps in can do just as good a job as he can for Chile.\" The Socceroos have no such worries in the run-up to the game. All 23 members of the squad have been passed fit, including Mark Bresciano, who had been struggling with a back injury. \"The way Mark Bresciano has been training, I feel that he looks confident,\" Cahill said. \"There's 23 players that are ready to go and I'm hoping that Bresc is one of those.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
