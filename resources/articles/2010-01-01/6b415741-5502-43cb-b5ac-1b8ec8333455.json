He featured a string of chief executives with interesting new products using Qualcomm technology, and announced support for Google's ChromeOS. Then, to end on a high, he gave 300 free FLO TVs to members of the audience. Jacobs' guests included HTC boss Peter Chou, Lenovo boss Yuanqing Yang, Todd Bradley, who runs Hewlett-Packard's Personal Systems Group, and D-Link boss Tony Tsao. These may not be household names, but HTC makes Google's Android phones, including the Nexus One, Lenovo is the biggest PC maker in China and took over IBM's PC business, and HP is now the world's largest technology company. All of that should worry Microsoft. HTC has always been the largest manufacturer of Windows Mobile phones, while IBM's PC division and HP have been two of Microsoft's three most important supporters (the other one is Dell). And both HP and Lenovo showed smartbooks, a format that Qualcomm is promoting as an alternative to netbooks. When I suggested that CES would see the start of a battle between ARM-based smartbooks and Intel Atom-powered netbooks, I imagined that the smartbooks would come from a dozen or so small Asian suppliers. Instead, the most interesting smartbooks have been shown by two of the largest PC manufacturers. To be fair, Yuanqing Yang said the Skylight smartbook was about extending the PC's reach, and HP's Todd Bradley stressed that he wasn't making a product announcement. But it won't help Microsoft if these companies sell lots of smartbooks running Linux rather than netbooks running Windows. For all these gadgets, the Qualcomm connection is the ARM-based Snapdragon processor used in Google's Nexus One phone. Jacobs believes that the chips used in smartphones will go into many other consumer electronics devices in the future. They might look different but they'll all have mobile phone technology inside. One example is the ebook reader, and Jacobs showed one using Mirasol. \"You've seen E Ink displays in devices like the Kindle, so this display technology does the same thing, except does it with full colour and with full-motion video,\" he said. But the highlight of Jacobs' keynote was the appearance of Eric Topol, who is, among other things, chief medical officer of the West Wireless Health Institute. He showed an impressive range of health gadgets including Zeo's device for measuring sleep quality, a Corventis Piix heart monitor, and a small machine for doing echo cardiograms -- a sort of high-tech stethoscope. Jacobs isn't a big-name presenter and didn't attract the capacity crowd that went to see Steve Ballmer's opening keynote, but I'd bet more people ended up better informed, and happier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
