Launching Labour's local election campaign Mr Blair said the 15 million voters had a choice between the high priests of Thatcherism and a government with a strong economic record. Mr Blair had chosen the 25th anniversary of Lady Thatcher's moving into Downing St as prime minister for the launch and he said a return to the failed policies of the past would wreck progress. But he echoed Lady Thatcher's rhetoric saying: \"In each of these communities of this country where there has been despair, we offer hope, where there has been underachievement we put ambition for the future.\" Mr Blair, Mr Brown and John Prescott travelled to a family learning centre in south Leeds to underline the point that the government's capital spending is having a practical impact. Mr Blair, with Mr Brown smiling by his side, took a string of questions about how long he planned to stay in the job insisting he had answered the question \"hundreds of times before\". Asked if it would be a success or failure if he lasted longer as prime minister than Lady Thatcher he said: \"I do not stand here today wanting to emulate Margaret Thatcher. I stand here proud of what we've achieved as a Labour government and I want us to carry on achieving, to carry on taking the country forward, not backwards.\" One opinion poll yesterday had him trailing Michael Howard in popularity, putting pressure on him to stop the rot in the local elections and prove he is still an electoral asset. Mr Blair said: \"For all the difficulties and criticisms people have got of the government and the prime minister I think the country does understand the economy is stronger, it can see the public investment is working. I say to people believe the evidence of your own eyes.\" He said people were in a contradictory state of mind: \"They read a lot of bad stuff about the NHS, but a lot of people say 'actually I got quite good service from the NHS'.\" He urged people to see for themselves what was happening to their local schools and hospitals. Apart from a 20-page glossy brochure doing duty as a manifesto Labour's three big hitters made no pledges on the future of local government or gave any hint of what may be in the white paper which will set out out a 10-year plan for local government. Mr Blair said he would like to see more neighbourhood control over policing while Mr Prescott promised that by the summer the government would have a view on whether to change the balance of funding between central and local government. At present central government provides 80% of local council funding. Instead the trio spent their time lambasting the Conservatives' economic policy and promised to do more to cut unemployment, an area over which councils have little direct control. Mr Prescott said the economic strategy of the shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, would require an immediate cut of \u00a32.4bn in central funding of local government, equivalent to a 10% rise in council tax. Labour also claimed that council tax in Tory areas is higher, with the average council tax per dwelling in Tory councils at \u00a31,072 compared to \u00a3870 in Labour authorities. The Tories had different figures showing that in 2004-5 Conservative councils charged an estimated \u00a353 a year less on Band D council tax bills than Labour or Liberal Democrat councils. Labour said its figure was more representative since many councils have very few Band D dwellings. Mr Brown spelt out new welfare to work pilot projects while saying that in the majority of local council areas unemployment had fallen by more than 50% under Labour. He said: \"The Tories are a recession-prone party. Michael Howard and his shadow cabinet are a recession waiting to happen. A special responsibility falls upon mid-term second governments never to be complacent ... and we will not rest until we advance further and faster to full employment.\" Labour's biggest worry is low turnout and a swing to the Liberal Democrats because of the Iraq war. Mr Blair said Iraq was unlikely to figure prominently in what would be a bread and butter campaign. He said that if there was apathy it was because politics was seen through \"the prism of scandal\". But Mr Prescott said turnout may rise since all-postal ballots were being held in four regions comprising a third of the electorate. \"If you can get the balloting process better, you can get people to vote,\" he said, pointing out that in some areas postal ballots have seen turnout rise to 50%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
