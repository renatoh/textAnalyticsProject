The footage on thesun.co.uk show Sterling inhaling the gas from an orange balloon, laughing and then asking friends for another hit. The video, which it is claimed was taken at his home some days before the Newcastle game, then shows him either unconscious or asleep. A club spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the story and intend to speak to the player. Any subsequent action will be taken internally.\u201d The latest leak comes hot on the heels of a photograph of the 21-year-old smoking from a shisha pipe being put on the internet.
