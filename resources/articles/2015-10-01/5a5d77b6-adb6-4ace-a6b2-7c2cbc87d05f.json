Whatever the reason, they will very often identify with what they perceive to be the paper\u2019s political philosophy. When that newspaper falls short of their expectations they often feel personally slighted \u2013 and they protest. Jeremy Corbyn has been Labour leader for six weeks now but some readers are still sore at the Observer\u2019s questioning of his suitability to lead the opposition during the leadership campaign. \u201cWe had expected the rightwing press to try to undermine Corbyn\u2019s campaign, but have been shocked that you joined in the attack by the establishment on what is the most hopeful development in British politics that people with progressive views of our age [70 and 67] have ever seen,\u201d wrote one couple. \u201cThere is a new movement in our country that challenges the old status quo. We hope you will begin to wake up to what is happening and not continue to stay on the side of the stale old media establishment.\u201d Noting that the paper had published a contrary view from one of its staff, the veteran reporter Ed Vulliamy, they added: \u201cHe is absolutely right that you have let down a large section of your readership.\u201d Another reader wrote to say she was cancelling her subscription after 30 years. \u201cThe sneering treatment meted out to the Corbyn campaign, with the underlying message that this paper was also buying into the assumption that the narrow-minded monetarist version of political argument is the only one which matters, has finally killed off my last remaining loyalty,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel betrayed and lonely out here, believing that \u2013 electability or non-electability aside \u2013 it is time somebody widened the argument, opened up the political landscape and challenged the centre-right hegemony that is doing such unutterable damage to the ideal of a compassionate society. I have diverted the funds formally spent on my subscription to my new membership of the Labour party.\u201d There is also some sense that the space for dissenting voices is diminishing on the letters page. \u201cIf Corbyn can give more people a voice in his parliamentary questions, the Observer might do the same,\u201d complained a reader after he suspected that his letter was squeezed out by a piece from the chancellor, George Osborne, and Treasury commercial secretary, Jim O\u2019Neill, on China, which, he maintained \u201csat like a cuckoo atop the letters nest\u201d. He complained that ministers who can count on generous news coverage are also given the opportunity to present what he called \u201cpolitical spin\u201d on the letters page. The comment editor, who edits the letters, responded: \u201cWe receive many more letters than we can use. So it\u2019s a question of choosing the most interesting while ensuring a range of themes and most certainly attempting to capture the readers\u2019 passions. If there is a strong response pointing in one direction, we reflect that. An editorial headlined \u2018If Jeremy Corbyn is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question\u2019 (19 July) provoked a healthy mailbag disagreeing with our line. We rightly highlighted this response, making it the Big Issue on the letters page the following week, with a series of readers pulling no punches. \u2018More generally, Vulliamy\u2019s piece is only one of several strong pro-Corbyn articles we\u2019ve run in the past few months. Indeed, we led the Comment section with a thoughtful, passionate piece from Rosie Fletcher on 23 August.\u201d While broadly sympathetic to Labour, the Observer has never slavishly attached itself to any party or political philosophy. It chose not to endorse any leadership candidate last month and it remains what it has always been: a sceptical chronicler of the political scene with a very long memory, not just of the strife that tore Labour apart in the 1970s (and kept it in opposition for 18 years) but reaching even further back. Take a look at the Observer archive today. This week in 1960, the Labour party was undergoing a leadership tussle between Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson. The paper probably upset some of its readers then when its editorial declared: \u201cIn our view, there is no doubt which choice is more likely to sink the Labour party\u2019s electoral chances. If its centre of gravity moves leftwards, it will get further out of touch with the Britain of today and it will lose voters to the Liberals by the shoal.\u201d I share the view of some readers that the paper and the media in general misread the depth of desire, particularly among young Labour voters, for the change that Jeremy Corbyn represents, but time (and the parliamentary Labour party) will tell if that flood of goodwill will be enough to carry him to electoral victory. observer.readers@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
