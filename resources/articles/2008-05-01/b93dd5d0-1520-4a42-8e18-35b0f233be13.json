But on a street near the centre, floodlights and the grind of cutting equipment announced that rescue workers were toiling through the night. It had been a Commercial Bank, said one bystander; a Bank of China, said someone else. You couldn't tell any more. All that was left was a great mound where the building had slid forward into the road as if it were melting butter. Slumped against the ladder of his vehicle, a firefighter tried to recover his strength. His team, from the paramilitary police, had begun work at one in the morning. Twenty-one hours later, they had not stopped. Behind him, a bulldozer scooped great clawfuls of plaster, brick and metal from the wreckage. Rescuers had pulled out seven people overnight, only for one to die later. In the whole of the rest of yesterday, they had found just one survivor. No one knew how many people were inside when the building collapsed so abruptly. So far no dead bodies had been found. Perhaps most inside got out in time; perhaps they lay beneath too many feet of debris. \"Although I've been a firefighter many years, and have done many rescues, it's hard to see life fade away,\" said the man, who dubbed himself \"Weishi\" - bodyguard. \"But we're having to move to shifts now - they need our skills and the supplies can't meet the needs to keep us going. We're exhausted and there's not enough food for us, just water and biscuits, because such a large area is affected.\" The survivors he is searching for are only a handful of the thousands believed to be buried in the rubble of this city, most in the outlying districts. As time wore on, hopes dimmed. Army lorries and trucks carrying earthmoving equipment were still toiling up the expressway from the provincial capital of Chengdu in the heavy rain. Thousands of soldiers and paramilitary police from unaffected parts of Sichuan and neighbouring Yunnan province have flooded into the area. But they face a Herculean task. Even in the centre, roads were partially or totally blocked by falling masonry and trees. The front of buildings had been torn open; ominous gaps in the runs of buildings betrayed the ruins beneath them. Hundreds of families had fled to the few open spaces in the city - the central square, the stadium, the park and even a roundabout where half a dozen families were sheltering from the heavy rain under giant sunshades. As a woman circled them in a car, shouting the name of a missing friend, two laid-off factory workers watched over their slumbering seven-year-old daughter. She was tucked up under a duvet - one of the few things they had managed to grab from their flat. \"It happened so suddenly - we had no chance to prepare,\" said the 40-year-old mother, who did not want to give her name. \"I felt faint and it suddenly started to shake and I couldn't stand. At first I didn't realise it was an earthquake. Then the tiles started falling from the walls and ceiling. The noise was really scary. I was so frightened and grabbed a few clothes and ran out. \"Our daughter was on her way to school, only about 500 metres from our home, but she couldn't stay standing and because she was close to buildings things were falling down on her. It was very dangerous, but luckily older children grabbed her and brought her here to the middle, where it's safer.\" The couple had little water and not much food, they said. They also had nothing but praise for the rescue effort. \"The government is transferring people to safer places. Because we are in the middle here, even if the surrounding houses collapse we shall be OK,\" the woman said. \"Because the earthquake affected such a large area, troops are rescuing students and people from the countryside, where many homes collapsed. We have seen lots of the paramilitary police and nurses trying to help.\" Her 54-year-old husband was equally stoical. \"Because this is a natural disaster, we couldn't do anything. We can't complain - we need courage to face it,\" he said. \"The government has really helped a lot. Yesterday all the officials came with these big sunshades and helped us to construct a shelter. If they hadn't, we'd be staying here in the rain.\" Despite their troubles, everyone in the sea of tarpaulins knows that they are fortunate. With communications in the city still patchy at best, rumours abound. \"I heard that more than 10,000 people could be buried or dead around Mianzhu,\" said a 17-year-old girl camping with her parents in Central Square. More than 30 hours had passed since the quake struck, but down the road at the bank site, Weishi refused to give up. \"We still have some hope of reaching people,\" he said. \"We hope a miracle happens.\" \u00b7 Additional research by Chen Shi"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
