The testimony to a Senate inquiry on Tuesday followed earlier warnings from pharmacists, health researchers, community groups and advocates for older Australians that the proposal risked affecting patients\u2019 compliance with prescriptions issued by doctors. Officials said there was inadequate evidence to suggest patients were failing to fill scripts due to cost, prompting the Greens senator Richard Di Natale to claim the arguments belonged to the \u201cflat earth society\u201d. The government expects to raise $1.3bn over four years by increasing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) co-payments and safety net thresholds from 1 January 2015. That money is to be channelled into the new medical research future fund. The $37.70 co-payment for general patients would increase by $5 to $42.70 if the legislation was passed. For concessional patients the $6.10 co-payment would increase by 80c to $6.90. The Coalition plans to prioritise debate on the measure when the Senate resumes next week, but faces a challenge to secure adequate support given concerns raised by Labor, the Greens and the Palmer United Party. The PBS increases are a separate measure from the proposed new Medicare co-payment for GP visits. In the case of the $7 GP co-payment the government has argued that a \u201cprice signal\u201d is needed. The Senate\u2019s community affairs legislation committee, which is examining the PBS bill, heard concerns about cost from several groups in Canberra on Tuesday. In June a report of the now-defunct council of Australian governments (Coag) reform council suggested one in 12 Australians had delayed or avoided filling a medical prescription because of cost, a decision that was twice as likely in the most disadvantaged areas compared with the most advantaged areas. But the Department of Health\u2019s acting deputy secretary, Richard Bartlett, took issue with many of the submissions to the inquiry for suggesting that there was significant evidence of patients already not filling scripts due to cost. \u201cThe fact is there is very little hard evidence to support this claim,\u201d Bartlett told the hearing. \u201cThe vast majority of submissions refer to anecdotal evidence or unpublished survey data which is almost impossible to scrutinise or break down. For example the main reference provided in the majority of submissions is the Coag reform council analysis. The fact is this analysis is also based on unpublished survey data.\u201d Felicity McNeill, the first assistant secretary of the department\u2019s pharmaceutical benefits division, disputed assertions about the impact of a big increase to PBS co-payments in 2005. McNeill said the surveys at that time only looked at data about medicines that exceeded the co-payment levels. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t allowed for the fact that a number of drugs went under the general co-payment so actually in those areas we found there was an increase in the use of those drugs,\u201d she said. McNeill said some products increased and others decreased and a range of factors may be behind those trends. Di Natale, one of the senators conducting the inquiry, told officials: \u201cAre you suggesting seriously that an increase in the PBS co-payment is not going to have an impact on compliance [by patients]? Are you seriously suggesting that?\u201d Bartlett replied: \u201cIf you listen to what Ms Neill said about 2005, senator, I\u2019d be questioning on what you would expect me to base an answer that says \u2018yes there will be an increase in non-compliance\u2019 \u2026 There is no evidence from 2005 that will allow you to say there is a decrease in compliance there that we can therefore extrapolate to this one.\u201d Di Natale said: \u201cWe\u2019re with the flat earth society here.\u201d The Grattan Institute\u2019s health program director, Stephen Duckett, who is a former senior health bureaucrat, said earlier that there was \u201cextremely strong evidence that co-payments stop people getting the medicines that their doctor ordered\u201d. Duckett\u2019s joint submission with health fellow Peter Breadon said: \u201cA recent systematic review looked at 19 studies in nine countries. All but two of these studies found that co-payments reduce the number of people who take medications their doctor ordered.\u201d The submission also said in its summary: \u201cThere is strong evidence that out-of-pocket costs stop people getting healthcare, including necessary care. While they save money in the short term, they mean that some people miss out on care they need. In the long term, government risks paying more.\u201d The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, which represents pharmacists, said it was concerned that PBS co-payments had already \u201creached such a high level that there is a danger of patients foregoing some of their necessary medications due to cost\u201d. The submission by the society\u2019s chief executive, Lance Emerson, raised concern that the Department of Health did not specifically model the impact of the proposed co-payment changes on patient behaviour. Combined with the proposed Medicare co-payment for GP visits, out-of-hospital pathology and diagnostic imaging services, \u201cvulnerable patients may be forced into a situation where they need to make a financial decision about seeking medical attention or continuing with their medications instead of focusing on their health\u201d, Emerson said. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia \u2013 an employers\u2019 organisation representing community pharmacies \u2013 said it was \u201cappropriate that a price signal exists, and that a safety net is in place\u201d but noted that \u201cincreases to PBS co-payments and safety nets may discourage patients from purchasing their prescribed medicines, leading to non-adherence to a medication regime\u201d. \u201cAny increase in price signals should be accompanied by a greater commitment to the funding of well-targeted medication management and support services, focused on those patients in greatest clinical need who have the highest risk of non-adherence to their medicines,\u201d the guild said in its submission. The Council of Social Service of New South Wales told the inquiry cost barriers to medicines would \u201clead to more preventable and expensive health problems and increased costs to the health system long term\u201d. The council said higher health costs could force people living poverty to choose \u201cbetween filling a prescription, buying food, or paying an electricity bill\u201d. The Council on the Ageing (Cota) Australia said increases to the out-of-pocket expenses for both non-concessional and concessional patients could not be viewed in isolation. \u201cOlder people will incur these increases at the same time as the government is planning to introduce co-payments for GP visits and related diagnostic tests and decrease the value of the pension through changes to indexation and other initiatives,\u201d the submission said. \u201cCota is opposed both to the increases in co-payments and increases in the safety net thresholds. Getting the right medication at the right time should not depend on your ability to pay for it and people should not have to choose between food, heating and medications.\u201d But Bartlett argued the proposed increases were \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d and should be \u201cconsidered in the context of maintaining access for patients to medicines that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for most Australians\u201d. Bartlett said the unfunded pipeline of new medicines, an ageing population, and increased incidence of chronic disease would put continued upward pressure on the government\u2019s PBS costs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
