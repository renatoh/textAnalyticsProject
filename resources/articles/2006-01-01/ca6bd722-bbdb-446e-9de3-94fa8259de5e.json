Or is this just another marketing wheeze?", "bodyText": "The glossy leaflets that accompany electricity bills often offer more environmentally friendly energy products. Green electricity is becoming part of the range of services provided by energy companies. But as with any green product, the question is whether it offers more than a feelgood factor and a few extra pence on the price. For customers of mainstream electricity providers, the green label can mean many different things. In fact, there are so many ambiguities about what consumers really get from green electricity that this year Friends of the Earth has stopped producing its league table of tariffs and suppliers. At the moment, there are varying levels of eco-friendliness in green energy. For instance, it can mean recycling income from electricity sales to build more wind farms. Or it can mean that for each unit of power used by a customer on a green tariff, an equal amount will be generated for the supplier by a renewable source. Or else, it might be a rather more light-green version, in which part of the green electricity customer's bill goes towards a fund promoting renewable energy projects. There are also charity green power schemes. For instance, there is RSPB Energy, in which the bird charity gets \u00a310 for each customer and the electricity units used are matched by energy bought from renewable sources. While supporting the principle of environmentally friendly energy, Friends of the Earth wants much more transparency and independent accreditation for what is meant by \"green electricity\". In particular, it wants customers to be able to see that choosing green power means additional amounts of renewable energy being brought into the system. As suppliers are already required to increase the use of energy from renewable sources, FoE is concerned that consumers should not be subsidising these regulatory requirements through higher rate green tariffs. \"By paying for a green tariff, you could end up simply paying extra to help the electricity company meet its legal obligations - without increasing demand for renewable electricity,\" says FoE."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
