The initiative came after Labour MP Chris Williamson was suspended after appearing to downplay the significance of complaints, saying the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d over antisemitism. Some of the Labour MPs who quit the party last week cited a failure to deal properly with the issue, with Luciana Berger, a Jewish MP, branding the party \u201csickeningly institutionally racist\u201d. The letter, signed by nearly 500 Labour members so far, said: \u201cWe are Labour members who support Jeremy Corbyn in his leadership and the progressive, socialist programme and anti-racist principles of the Labour party. \u201cWe have seen antisemitism from Labour members and supporters, online or offline. We recognise that as a movement we have been too slow to acknowledge this problem, too tolerant of the existence of antisemitic views within our ranks, too defensive and too eager to downplay it. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to the Jewish community, and our Jewish comrades in the party, for our collective failure on this issue to date.\u201d The initiative was supported by Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, with many sharing the hashtag #Socialists4Change, amid deep anguish in the party about its approach to antisemitism. Momentum also released a video online debunking antisemitic conspiracy theories. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, said on Thursday that he regarded Berger\u2019s departure last week as \u201cthe worst day of shame in the party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d. He told Radio 5: \u201cIt is a badge of shame that Luciana Berger, a bright, young, female, pregnant MP, was bullied out of her own constituency by racist thugs, and I\u2019m not putting up with it.\u201d He went on to accuse Williamson of having been \u201cdeliberately inflammatory\u201d over antisemitism in the party and described Labour as \u201ccurrently mired in a racism scandal\u201d. He told BBC Radio 5 Live that disciplinary action should be concluded swiftly against the Derby North MP, who had the whip removed and was suspended from the party. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely weeks, not months, in my view,\u201d Watson said. Although he said Williamson should be allowed to present his case in a formal hearing, the deputy leader condemned his comments. In the footage, first revealed by the Yorkshire Post, Williamson was applauded by activists in Sheffield when he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d Watson said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen his recent contributions that have appeared online and was very concerned it was almost like he was being deliberately inflammatory, deliberately trying to cause offence to people who are concerned about antisemitism \u2013 not just the Jewish community but people who are fighting racism in their daily political lives.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very clear \u2013 his behaviour in my view was unacceptable, which is why it was absolutely right for the whip to be removed and him to be suspended.\u201d Williamson, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, remains popular with some Labour members. On the MP\u2019s Facebook page, of 800 comments under his apology for the comments, the vast majority were supportive, and many condemned Watson. In his first comment after the suspension, Williamson tweeted thanks to Labour members and supporters \u201cfor the incredible solidarity you have shown me over the last 48 hours\u201d, adding a link to a song popular in the US civil rights movement, Keep Your Eyes on the Prize. Williamson issued his apology on Wednesday over the filmed comments. Shortly afterwards, a spokesman for Corbyn announced Williamson had been issued with a \u201cnotice of investigation\u201d; but he would remain a Labour member. Several backbenchers told the Guardian they were convinced Corbyn himself had been involved in the decision not to suspend Williamson immediately. But a Labour spokesman insisted: \u201cJeremy did not intervene.\u201d The party announced his suspension on Wednesday evening following an outcry from a series of Labour MPs, 38 of whom wrote jointly to the Labour general secretary, Jennie Formby, to demand the move. Williamson was also facing complaints about having booked a room in parliament to screen a controversial film about Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party. Watson deflected a series of questions on Radio 5 about whether Corbyn should speak out more strongly on the issue, and condemn Williamson, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s not letting me down. He has to make his own decisions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
