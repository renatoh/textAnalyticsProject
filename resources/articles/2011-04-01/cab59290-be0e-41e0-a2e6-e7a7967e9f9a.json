The Capa photograph of a Gypsy wedding in Slovakia in 1947 could be the rarest surviving image by the Magnum agency photographer, who was killed covering the conflict in Indochina in 1954. The photo survives only as a single print, with the negative thought to have been lost in the 1950s, and is expected to fetch up to \u00a39,000 in Paris on 30 April. The collection of photographs from the 1930s to the 1970s was amassed over 70 years by the veteran magazine photo editor John G. Morris, a colleague and close friend of many of the 20th century's greatest newspaper and magazine photographers. The collection includes photographs by Henri Cartier-Bresson, David Seymour, Dorothea Lange, George Rodger, Eugene Smith, Willy Ronis, Ren\u00e9 Burri, Otto Hagel and Hansel Mieth, Marc Riboud, Lisa Larsen, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Philip Jones Griffiths. Morris, now aged 94, was the London picture editor of Life magazine during the second world war. At its peak, Life regularly sold millions of copies a week. It was the primary showcase for the world's leading documentary photographers, with socially concerned picture-based stories focused on ordinary life. Capa had already been hailed as the world's greatest war photographer for his Spanish civil war images, including the famous \"falling soldier\" shot, when Morris worked with him on the story that led to the most famous series of photographs of all time \u2013 the surviving \"magnificent 11\" shots of US troops landing on Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day. The sale includes a rare early print of one of those 11 shots. Also included in the auction, entitled The Photo Diary of John G. Morris, are several hitherto unseen photographs taken by Morris in France soon after D-Day, while he was working with his staff photographers on the frontline. Of great interest to photo-historians is a rare shot of Capa at work, photographing German prisoners being rounded up in Normandy. No other shot of Capa at work in a war zone is known to exist. Other rarities include informal photographs of the Kennedy clan in the 1950s taken by US photographer Toni Frissell. After Life magazine, Morris was the first executive editor of the celebrated Magnum photo agency. He went on to run the photo desks of the Washington Post and the New York Times. Speaking from his home in Paris, where he has lived since the early 1980s, Morris said: \"My hope is that this auction will change the outlook on photojournalism in the money markets. I know that's a strange thing to say, but photography auctions in the past have consisted primarily of aesthetically beautiful prints which did not necessarily have much to do with telling the truth about life through the daily newspapers and in magazines. \"Art photographs have been attracting enormous prices at auctions, but in the coming auction many of the prints have been used by newspapers and magazines, many of them with marks on, crop marks, publication marks, etc. It remains to be seen how these kind of photographs will go at auction.\" US-based Getty Images, the world's largest commercial picture library, is understood to be taking a close interest in the John Morris collection. Getty already owns the Hulton Picture Library, the archive of the British weekly news magazine Picture Post. In recent years, art photography has become a target market for dealers and investors. In 2006 a 1904 photograph of a moonlit pond by Edward Steichen sold for just under $3m (\u00a31.8m) at Sotheby's in New York. In 2008 Edward Weston's Nude (1925) fetched $1.6m at the same auction house. Last November Richard Avedon's 1955 shot, Dovima with Elephants, sold for $1.2m in Paris. \"As far as I know, this is the first photojournalism collection to come on to the art market,\" said Morris. \"So in setting minimum prices for the pictures, and estimates, it's been a sort of ballpark thing. We don't know what will sell and what won't.\" Prices for pictures in the Morris collection start at \u00a318, with the Capa shot of the Gypsy wedding an estimated \u20ac8,000-\u20ac10,000. \"My personal favourite is the Capa shot of the Gypsies,\" said Morris. \"That picture seems to touch people\u2026 I love it. Capa's humanity was special; he had a feeling for people, an instant rapport with almost anybody. I remember in Normandy in the war, we arrived in a Jeep one afternoon at Mont St Michel with Ernest Hemingway and the Time journalist Bill Walton. We took a walk up the street and Capa just stopped and joined a game of cribbage that some fishermen were playing, and next there would be a girl, and he joked 'Where's your boyfriend?' He just charmed the entire place in one walk. \"Henri [Cartier-Bresson] I respected for totally different reasons. He scarcely ever talked to the people he was photographing. He was a passionate person, but his passion emerged in curious ways. He would get angry, pull out a penknife and threaten you. He had a temper.\" Hollywood is set to bring to the big screen the story of Capa's love affair with fellow photographer Gerda Taro during the Spanish civil war. Provisionally entitled Waiting for Robert Capa, the film will be directed by Michael Mann and features Tamara Drewe star Gemma Arterton as Taro and The Social Network's Andrew Garfield as Capa. \"I have mixed feelings about selling the pictures,\" admitted Morris. \"But on the other hand, at my age, what the hell am I going to do with them? I'm not going to be around for ever.\" The Photo Diary of John G. Morris, Drouot Montaigne auction house, Paris, 30 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
