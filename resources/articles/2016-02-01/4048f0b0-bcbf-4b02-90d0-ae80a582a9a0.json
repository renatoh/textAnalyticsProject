Rosicky sustained a thigh injury against Burnley in the FA Cup and underwent a scan on the problem on Monday, having only come on in the 71st minute during his first match of the campaign. It is the latest blow for the Czech Republic captain, who has suffered numerous injuries since joining the club in 2006, most recently a knee issue. The 35-year-old, who has made 170 appearances in the Premier League over 10 years, is not expected to be offered a new contract at Arsenal when his current deal expires in the summer, meaning his final months at the club could be spent on the sidelines. Wenger did not know how long the midfielder would be out for but it is thought Rosicky \u2013 who had not played since June \u2013 will miss at least one month. Asked how he sustained the injury, Wenger said: \u201cNobody understands. I told him straight away after half-time to warm up. I observed him, he\u2019s very conscientious Tomas, he did sprint and sprint, and sprint. He comes on; after three minutes he got the injury. \u201cI looked at him and thought: \u2018Tomas you do not run properly\u2019 because he didn\u2019t lift his legs and he lost some balls. I was amazed because he is at the top level technically. He told me after the game that he did it [the injury] straight away. \u201cHe warmed up well, for 20 minutes. He\u2019s devastated. Unbelievable. He\u2019s such a good player but his career has been disrupted by so many injuries. He was born in 1980, he\u2019s 35, it\u2019s difficult for him. Let\u2019s hope we have good news, that it is not as bad as feared.\u201d Arsenal play Southampton in the league at the Emirates on Tuesday night, one month after they were comprehensively beaten 4-0 by Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. Other than Rosicky, Wenger will be able to select from a fully fit squad, with Mesut \u00d6zil likely to return to the starting lineup after being rested in the Cup. The Arsenal manager blamed the defeat at St Mary\u2019s on a lack of mental focus but said his side\u2019s ability to respond to a disappointing result has improved. \u201cI think the team has a good mentality, a good level of humility and a good togetherness,\u201d he said. \u201cHumility means that you question your performance every time, that you are ready to put a shift in. This team relies a lot on work rate. \u201cSouthampton have a good team and let\u2019s not forget they won at Man United, they won at Chelsea, they are a team with quality players like Tadic, Man\u00e9, Long, Pell\u00e8, Fonte at the back, Wanyama. They are a team with top quality.\u201d \u201cI felt on the day [in December] we did not have the mental energy. We put a lot in. It was Christmas, we always go to Southampton at the Christmas period. We got caught by a team that was full of desire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
