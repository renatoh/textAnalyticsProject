His wife, Li Wenzu, fears that the authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to hold him under de facto house arrest indefinitely. She said Wang has been released from prison but authorities had sent him to his home town, Jinan, in the north-eastern province of Shandong (400km south of Beijing) for quarantine. Chinese authorities have been using compulsory quarantine as a pretext to detain or restrict the movements of government critics. \u201cThe government is continuing to restrict his personal freedoms and forcing us to be separated,\u201d Li told the Guardian. \u201cThis behaviour is shameless, I\u2019m absolutely opposed to this and am very angry. \u201cI fear the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to detain him. Would it be just 14 days as they say? I can\u2019t trust them. So long as my husband has no freedom, I\u2019ll continue to fight until he comes back.\u201d Wang called his wife from the prison yesterday telling her to refrain from going to meet him in prison. In a recording she posted on Twitter, Wang said he had to be quarantined \u201cfor some time\u201d due to the pandemic. When Li, who has been frequently harassed by the authorities, angrily asked whether he was prompted to say that under duress, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back together, but there\u2019ll be a process.\u201d \u201cThe Linyi prison\u2026 forced Quanzhang to \u2018persuade\u2019 me into accepting the arrangement of sending him to Jinan. I absolutely oppose it,\u201d Li said on Twitter: \u201cWang Quanzhang needs real freedom, our family needs to be reunited.\u201d In a practice dubbed \u201cnon-release release\u201d by respected China law expert Jerome Cohen at the New York University, Chinese rights activists are often released from prison into de facto house arrest or enforced restriction to their native village, where they remain for years. \u201cWhat will Wang Quanzhang\u2019s \u2018release\u2019 on April 5 amount to?\u201d asked Cohen in his blog. Wang, a lawyer who had taken on politically sensitive cases and defended activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong, was sentenced to jail in January 2019 on the blanket charge of \u201csubversion of state power\u201d. He was one of more than 300 lawyers and activists detained in a wave of crackdowns that started in July 2015. He was the last lawyer of the group to be convicted, with his trial taking place three-and-a-half years after he was taken away by the authorities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
