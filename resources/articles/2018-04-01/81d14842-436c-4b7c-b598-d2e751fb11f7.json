That was a cheeky reference to the fact this game, originally scheduled for last month, had been postponed due to snow at an unseasonal but very convenient time for Derby, who were suffering from several injuries. Neil Warnock had vented his anger at that postponement, which came as his team hoped to go 10 points clear in second place. Now they are only one point ahead of third-place Fulham, with Aston Villa are also lurking dangerously. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t blame the weather for the goals we conceded,\u201d said the Cardiff manager sardonically after seeing his team defend with uncharacteristic sloppiness to allow Derby to score three times in the second half. While casting doubt on Cardiff\u2019s promotion hopes the result breathed new life into Derby\u2019s, as two goals from Cameron Jerome either side of one by Matej Vydra lifted Gary Rowett\u2019s side into the play-off places. At one point this season Derby looked a good bet to go up automatically but the way their challenge had dwindled in recent months led to Rowett suggesting the club is cursed. \u201cI was just trying to get myself out of the firing line by saying it was a curse,\u201d admitted Rowett after this win. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put your finger on why it\u2019s happened five seasons in a row but until we can change it and get promoted that\u2019s always going to be levelled at Derby.\u201d It did not look like changing here when Callum Patterson gave Cardiff the lead in the 28th minute with a crisp volley after a cross from the left by Joe Bennett. Scott Carson, Derby\u2019s goalkeeper, had barely had a meaningful touch up to that point but Cardiff nearly beat him again two minutes later when Junior Hoilett went close. The visitors might have also gone further ahead before half-time if the referee had blown for a penalty after the ball struck Bradley Johnson\u2019s hand in the box. Cardiff were looking sturdy even if Derby\u2019s pace on the break was a concern. By the hour Rowett had decided it was time for a new approach so cast on Vydra to forage behind Jerome. Still the home team struggled to produce enough precision to unhinge the well-organised visitors. Gary Madine was guilty of inaccuracy, too, in the 65th minute, as he skewed a shot wide from nine yards after a Cardiff break. The cost of that miss soon increased. Derby\u2019s equaliser was surprisingly straightforward. After messy defending by the visitors, Richard Keogh sent a header into the box and Jerome held off Sean Morrison before diverting the ball past Etheridge from six yards. Vydra completed the turnaround by lashing into the net from 12 yards after a cut-back by Wisdom. Jerome made sure of the result in the last minute, pestering Morrison into another mistake before shooting past Etheridge. They now face a trip to Aston Villa on Saturday and their final game is at home to Barnsley. \u201cThat [defending] is not like us,\u201d said Warnock, whose last two games are at Hull and home to Reading. \u201cIt\u2019s a match we should have won but, as I said to the players, every team in the league apart from Wolves would love to be where we are. And at least we know what we have to do now: win the last two games.\u201d No one is more experienced than Warnock at navigating through nervy run-ins. He is aiming for his eighth promotion in a managerial career spanning more than three decades. When he achieved his first by leading Scarborough out of the Conference in 1987, Rowett was still coming to grips with secondary school. After this result there is still a chance of them being classed together in next season\u2019s Premier League. \u201cThe run we were on has been incredibly deflating but we\u2019ve retained belief and this win is a massive boost for us,\u201d said Rowett."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
