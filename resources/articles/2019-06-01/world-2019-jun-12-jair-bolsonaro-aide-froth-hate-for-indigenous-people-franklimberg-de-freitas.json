Franklimberg de Freitas addressed around 100 staff at the Funai agency after his dismissal on Tuesday, which he blamed on pressure from the country\u2019s powerful agribusiness lobby, which has long sought to develop the vast indigenous reserves of the Amazon. The episode is the latest clash in the battle over indigenous rights under Bolsonaro, who promised \u201cnot one more centimetre\u201d of land would be allocated to indigenous people and moved to dismantle Funai\u2019s power on his first day in office. \u201cThe president is very badly advised when it comes to indigenous politics in this country,\u201d de Freitas said in his speech, reported by local newspaper Folha de S.Paulo and confirmed by the Guardian. He singled out a senior agriculture ministry official Nabhan Garcia, who is the president of an agribusiness lobby. \u201cNabhan, when he talks about the indigenous people, froths hate for them,\u201d said de Freitas who added that Funai is seen as \u201can obstacle to national development\u201d in Bolsonaro\u2019s government. This marked the second time that de Freitas has been been forced out of Funai: in April 2018 the retired army general was fired by the previous government of Michel Temer after pressure from an agribusiness lobby that considered him too sympathetic to indigenous tribes. In January, he returned to the agency which is responsible for around 900,000 indigenous people and reserves that represent 13% of Brazil\u2019s territory. This week Funai\u2019s staff association issued a letter to Bolsonaro expressing concerns at \u201cthe suffocating termination of the management of indigenous administration\u201d. Hours after Bolsonaro took office in January, he signed an executive order stripping the agency of the power to allocate indigenous territory. That responsibility was passed to the agriculture ministry, which experts say would halt demarcations. Congress voted to undo the president\u2019s actions in May. \u201cFunai lives under attack,\u201d a Funai employee told the Guardian under the condition of anonymity. \u201cBolsonaro has made it clear what he wants for the indigenous people\u2026 Everyone is frightened, but we\u2019re used to it \u2013 we knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy for us.\u201d Additional reporting by Dom Phillips"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
