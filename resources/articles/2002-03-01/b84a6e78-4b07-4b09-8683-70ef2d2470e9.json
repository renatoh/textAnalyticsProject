The museum insisted that its claim to inalienable ownership of the bronzes and other artefacts such as the Parthenon (Elgin) marbles was not affected. Until now its standard response to restitution demands and any other claims has been that it is forbidden to dispose of items. The Nigerian parliament passed a resolution to submit an official request for the return of the bronzes. The campaign for the return of the Parthenon marbles in time for the Olympic games in Athens is intensifying: MPs will be invited to vote in two weeks on a backbench motion calling for a change in the law to allow the museum to return the marbles. In this context the revelation yesterday that dozens of superb quality bronzes were sold off as \"duplicates\", both on the open art market and to a proposed national Nigerian museum in Lagos in the 1950s, is a severe embarrassment. The most recent sale was in 1972, after which legal advice was obtained by the museum and the policy was changed. Brian Durrans, keeper of ethnography, the department which, long before his day, sold the bronzes, said: \"I do not accept that this is an episode which has any bearing on the debate over the marbles.\" \"The disposals were not wanton or large scale, and the intentions behind it were honourable, but I regret the loss of these pieces to the collection. The law was originally intended to protect the collections made in previous years from the whim of today's collectors.\" The details of the sales emerged when the Art Newspaper had a British Museum file on the affair declassified. This outlined how pairs of superb centuries old plaques, bought by the museum in 1898, were split up and half sold as duplicates. Some were sold through a dealer to establish their commercial value - they went for under \u00a3100 each, though they would now be worth tens of thousands - before others were sold to Nigeria, where a national museum was being established in Lagos. There was a link, because a brother of the British Museum curator was involved in setting up the African museum, and the records show that there was an altruistic element to the disposal. Examples of the bronzes, cast over centuries in the ancient capital of modern Nigeria, are found in many collections. The campaign for their return to Nigeria was led by the late Labour MP Bernie Grant. The bronzes were seized as booty in a punitive British army raid. The royal palace and stores were ransacked: some of the bronzes still show scorch marks from being wrenched from pillars in the burning palace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
