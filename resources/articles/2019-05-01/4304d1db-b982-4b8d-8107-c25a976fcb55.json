The books and stationery store came bottom of a survey of Which? readers, who marked it below the ailing Homebase/Bunnings DIY chain and Sports Direct. The best-ranked chains were the electrical goods store Richer Sounds, the clothing business Rohan and the department store John Lewis. WH Smith has finished last in Which\u2019s poll \u2013 which this year asked 7,700 shoppers to rate their experience in buying non-grocery items at 100 major retailers \u2013 for six of the past nine years, and it was second-worst for the other three. This year, the survey was carried out only among Which? members, whereas previously it involved the general public. One shopper said \u201cStores are crowded, dirty and the staff unhelpful\u201d, while another said \u201cmy local store is untidy and too small for comfort\u201d. An anonymous WH Smith watcher, who \u2013 as @WHS_Carpet \u2013 regularly tweets pictures of messy aisles, non-bargain prices and worn flooring to more than 24,000 followers, said: \u201cThere have been some improvements in certain locations, but the overall high street scenario is one of staff being hamstrung by more redundancies and cuts in hours.\u201d Despite sales falls, WH Smith said its high street chain had produced its second-best performance in the past 10 years in 2018. \u201cThis survey accounts for the views of only 586 Which? subscribers and is neither statistically relevant nor meaningful relative to our loyal customer base,\u201d the company said. \u201cEvery week, we serve 3 million customers in our 600 UK high street stores and have maintained our presence on the high street where many other retailers are closing stores. We work hard to improve customer experiences and continue to invest in new and existing stores.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
