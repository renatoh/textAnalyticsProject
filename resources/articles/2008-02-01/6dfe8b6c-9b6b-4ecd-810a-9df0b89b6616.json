American foreign policy is full of missed moments - the most recent and disturbing of which was in April 2003 when Iran made a normalisation offer to the US that included putting on the table recognition of Israel, cutting its support of Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorist activities, and its nuclear programme in exchange for some gestures from the US, the most important of which was ending our regime change ambitions against Iran's incumbent leadership. Had America initiated discussions with Iran when this incredible offer was made, we may still have had problems, but history certainly would be different. We may have been still wrestling over control of Iraq - but perhaps beneath the turmoil, America might have definitively secured a no-nukes deal with Iran and potentially the beginning of a new \"collaboration\" if not partnership promoting a stable, workable equilibrium in the Middle East. The Saudi proposal for Arab state normalisation with Israel is another not-yet-fulfilled moment that America may still fumble. And another has just appeared that could be a major pivot point in America's engagement with the world: Castro's emphatic declaration in the state paper Granma that he will absolutely not accept another term as president of Cuba. While few have yet come to understand the importance of his announcement and the manner of it in the US, the fact that Castro is concluding his term at the end of his constitutionally determined tenure demonstrates a respect for rule of law, at least in Cuban terms. A new president, most likely Raul Castro, will be selected by Cuba's national assembly on February 24. There is no less costly, easy to do, low-hanging-fruit among competing US foreign policy challenges than changing course and ending a decades-long embargo of travel and commerce with Cuba. The reasons to change are important and include tearing away the thickening walls of a cocoon that has kept the US and Cuba locked in a cold war stance that has grown only colder during the Bush and Bill Clinton administrations rather than part of the thaw that America has enabled with states like China, Vietnam and even North Korea. But more importantly, Cuba is no longer a satellite of Soviet interests. It no longer exports revolution and weapons. It exports doctors. During the horrific earthquake that hit the mountainous region along the Pakistan/Kashmir border in October 2005, Cuba - which had no diplomatic relations with Pakistan - sent 2,500 doctors to help treat the victims. Post-traumatic treatment was essentially long after the quake, and Cuba's doctors stayed for a full year. They had 17 base camps in the mountains compared to America's and Europe's single base camp each. This fundamentalist Islamic region would not allow male doctors to treat women - and if they did, the women would be killed. And thus, Cuba sent a huge contingent of female doctors. And this is a nation that America maintains on a terrorist watch list? Cuba's economy was badly ravaged after Soviet patronage of its economy ended - and with no external support, no clear economic methodologies to help it out of its problems, Castro changed Cuba to a stance of friendly engagement with much of the world. When I was there last March, I saw a Benetton store in the revitalised and mostly historically restored Old Havana. British Petroleum was having a mojito cocktail party on the roof of my hotel. I met Israelis involved with management of Cuban citrus groves. Chinese, Japanese and German agents were selling and/or bartering large-scale port infrastructure equipment. The Malecon, which I ran the length of every day, was filled with tourists - and I kept looking for police, for followers, for the political and social control mechanisms that one tripped over every few minutes in the former Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact nations, and there was nothing. I even tried to get into a major national event where vice president Raul Castro and National Assembly president Ricardo Alarcon were giving away awards for the 50th anniversary of a student revolt against former Cuban President Fulgencio Battista. I was in my running attire and tried to sneak through, telling the guard that I was an American observer (I was just a bit obnoxious to tell you the truth). The guard laughed it off and gave me credit for trying - but no man-handling, nothing of the sort that has become commonplace in American cities when mayors in DC or NY tell their police forces to arrest first and ask questions later when a WTO meeting or political convention is being hosted. Senator Chris Dodd set the gold standard during this presidential season by clearly stating what was obvious but that few would say - that the embargo of Cuba by the United States harms Americans and undermines US interests. He called not only for the opening of family travel between Cuban-Americans living in the US and their Cuban family counterparts in their homeland but for ceasing all travel restrictions for Americans going to Cuba. As Republican congressman Jeff Flake of Arizona has said in agreeing with Dodd, he'd rather see a foreign communist nation confronting him with restrictions on travel rather than the democratic government of the United States. Dodd called for an end to the economic embargo and for the promotion of people-to-people exchanges, commerce and the like. These, he said, would enrich the perspectives and options for both Cubans and Americans. None of the presidential candidates has met Dodd's sensible, pragmatic standard, but Barack Obama, in a brave op-ed in the Miami Herald last August, promoted a new spirit of engagement with Cuba and the belief that opening up family travel and allowing greater financial remittances would be a healthy step. In contrast, Hillary Clinton - reacting harshly to Obama's proposal in his article and his successful trip to Miami meeting more than 1,000 young Cuban-Americans - said that she saw no reason to change course from what the Bush administration was doing. Subsequently, her team has told me that when some kind of \"triggering event\" occurred, the campaign and her policy staff would conduct a \"full policy review\" of her position on US-Cuba relations. The stepping down of the longest-serving chief executive of any government today seems to be the kind of event that should be \"triggering\". So, perhaps the Clinton campaign will offer something new soon - but thus far nothing new has come from her spokespeople. John McCain seems to want to rile up a fight with the Cubans by inventing the memory that he witnessed Cuban agents torturing prisoners in Vietnam. McCain's recollections have never been mentioned before - and years of Red Cross, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International reports have never mentioned such a thing. Mike Huckabee was for ending the economic embargo with Cuba before he was for it. As governor of Arkansas, Huckabee wanted to trade with Cuba. But then when running for president, he forthrightly and honestly stated that his views had changed. The bottom line of all this is that changing the prism through which much of the world looks at the United States and its intentions will be difficult. The embargo failed to affect the course of Castro's political tenure. Maintaining it to satisfy an ethnic-American constituency probably had a positive impact on helping Castro achieve legitimacy in the eyes of his public as a nationalist protecting Cuba from the meddling of its huge neighbour. Clinton, McCain and Obama have all done a lot of speechifying about democracy in their statements about Cuba released today - but none of them acknowledges that Castro survived all of our attempts to undo him as well as the embargo. These presidential hopefuls maintain continuity with a completely failed policy. They all support political and economic engagement with China and Vietnam. Clinton and Obama even support the warming trends with North Korea. But on Cuba, it is our national leadership - even Obama and Clinton - who sound like old Soviet-era ideologues who fail to see that it is America that is isolated today while Cuba is reaping rewards and contact with the 183 nations that vote against America's embargo each year in the United Nations. I think that the embargo of Cuba and the restrictions on travel will end soon - not because of the \"leadership\" of those we are electing to office but because this backwards policy has become such an embarrassment to any who profess faith in it. US-Cuba policy has maintained itself because of the inattention of Americans to it. But one of the \"big personalities\" of the last 40 years is stepping down. Americans are now looking with new interest and wondering: who was this Castro? What is this embargo? The spotlight of attention will not allow the policies adopted by the US to continue. But frankly, if Obama and Clinton do come around on this - in the range of things a US president can do to show the entire world that we are different after eight years of the Bush presidency - ending the cold war with Cuba will send a positive, goose-bump-creating vibe through the world that we are finally believing in ourselves and in the positives that come from engagement. But regrettably as is consistent with much of American history, the next US president could miss another opportunity for enlightened action that history occasionally offers up.
