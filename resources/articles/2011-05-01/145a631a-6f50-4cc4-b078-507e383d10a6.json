For its latest UK appearance, the company presents the London premiere of Marston's own new work, Clara. Inspired by the passionate relationships Clara Wieck formed with Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms, the two composers to whom she was muse, the work explores love and friendship. While Wieck and Schumann were known to be lovers, this work poses the question of how close Clara came to Brahms. Completing the double bill is Howl, a work by Andrea Miller that explores the dynamic of mob mentality, violence and war. It's a tough, visceral piece that ratchets up the Bern:Ballet mix of classical and contemporary styles. Linbury Studio Theatre, WC2, Wed to 28 May Peter Schaufuss Ballet: Romeo &amp; Juliet, Llandudno, Eastbourne Ten years before Kenneth MacMillan created his now classic version of Romeo And Juliet, Frederick Ashton choreographed a setting of the Prokofiev score for Royal Danish Ballet. In contrast to the mass scale choreography, Ashton's version was intimate and classically styled. A couple of decades ago Peter Schaufuss brought this version back to England, when he was still artistic director of English National Ballet. Now, as director of his own Holstebro-based ballet company, he's staged it again, in a chamber version with a cast of just 12. This production \u2013 with the original costume designs by Peter Rice and new sets by Luciano Melin \u2013 is currently on a small UK tour before returning to London in the summer when it will feature two major Russian dancers, Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev, as guest stars in the title roles. Venue Cymru, Llandudno, Sun; Congress Theatre, Eastbourne, Mon &amp; Tue Rambert Dance Company, London Rambert has long had a light and clever touch with its repertory, mixing often surprising revivals with new commissions. In this special season to celebrate its 85th anniversary there's a rare performance of Paul Taylor's Roses. An evocation of love and mutability, it shows Taylor at his most lyrically expressive. Also featured in this Wells season is the London premiere of Monolith, a work by Tim Rushton showcasing his distinctively dark, burnished musical style. There's also a return of the spiky, surreal cabaret world of Henrietta Horn's Cardoon Club set to a hugely engaging score by Benjamin Pope that references 60s blues and psychedelic music. Music will be played live by the Rambert Orchestra. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Tue to 28 May \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2011. The original referred to Barn:Ballett and Bren:Ballett. This misspelling has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
