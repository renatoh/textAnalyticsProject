On his birthday last year, at a football match between Bolton and Tottenham, a Spurs supporter started pushing Wes's brother-in-law. So Wes stepped in - \"like a good Samaritan\" - and a riot ensued. He was found guilty of affray and sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid work (formerly called community service) as part of his community order. Ordinarily, this punishment would involve carrying out work for the benefit of his neighbourhood, toiling for at least six hours a week and completing the requirement within a year. Wes has been put to work driving a van for Barnardo's, picking up black bags of unwanted clothes and taking them to branches of the charity shop. But he is also getting the opportunity to spend some of those hours doing something to benefit himself directly, as one of the first offenders in Britain to take part in a pilot project called Thinking Skills for the Workplace. It might not have a jazzy title, but this is an innovative scheme. A classroom-based course spread across three days in three weeks, it aims to equip offenders with thinking, problem-solving, conflict resolution and communication skills to improve their employability. This focus on thinking and cognitive behaviour is what makes it different from existing training offered to offenders, which tends to focus on job-specific skills such as plastering or plumbing. It has been tried in the past in youth prisons, but never before with offenders in the community. If it is successful, and helps offenders get work and stops them committing further crime, the classes will be rolled out to over 100 offenders across greater Manchester, and perhaps eventually other parts of the country. Under current laws, up to 20% of an offender's unpaid work order can be used for such training. The thinking behind it is sound: there is a proven link between unemployment and crime, with about 65% of offenders not in a job when they are sentenced to unpaid work. Since he left school at 16 with a few low-grade GCSEs, Wes has had a string of jobs, from labouring to engineering to painting and decorating. But, bar a two-and-a-half-year stint as a window cleaner, he has had problems holding down a steady job. Which is how Wes has found himself in a classroom in a windowless lock-up on a grim industrial estate in Bolton pretending to be Andy, the boss of a mechanics firm, and trying to persuade a reluctant employee called Mickey - played by 16-year-old serial offender Tony - to work overtime. Andy has just got a big order in and is relying on Tony to clear the backlog. But Tony has promised to take his wife out for a romantic dinner this evening, and has worked late so often recently that cancelling is likely to result in domestic warfare. In front of two other offenders, Martin, 27, and Fitzy, 33 - as well as two probation officers and two basic skills support workers from the employment and training provider Work Solutions (the probation service's partner on this scheme) - the pair must come to an amicable compromise. Peaceful resolution Both Wes and Tony admit that compromising is not something they are naturally good at - \"especially if I think I'm right, which I always do,\" says Wes. But when all eyes are on them, the pair come to a peaceful resolution: Wes/Andy offers Tony/Mickey extra money and points out that he will be able to treat his wife to a nice steak instead of a McDonald's when he does eventually get time off. As well as roleplays like this, the course sees participants talking through other real and imagined scenarios as they are forced to rationalise their thinking and behaviour. It's not worlds away from cognitive behavioural therapy and it's an approach that the current guinea pigs seem to appreciate. \"Normally when you see a probation officer it's like being told to sit in the naughty corner - just a punishment rather than constructive, rehabilitative help,\" says Fitzy, who was given a nine-month suspended sentence, two years of probation and 120 hours of unpaid work when he was found guilty of knifing a man outside a pub after drinking 12 pints in an hour. Well educated Fitzy is an unusual offender, in that he is well educated, with a degree in genetics. Until 2001, he worked as a prison officer. But he was eager to come on this course after a long spell of unemployment caused by problems with his relationships and debt so bad that he was forced to declare himself bankrupt in 2003. Plasterer and father-of-two Martin is taking the course as part of the 160-hour unpaid work order he received after being prosecuted for racially aggravated criminal damage. He is whiling away the rest of his hours cooking food for the local church hall and calling out the bingo numbers. He says that he is enjoying the course so far. \"You learn more than you do when you're just on ordinary probation,\" he says. \"Normally probation officers just get you to sign your name and then you clear off. Here they focus on your needs as an individual.\" Once offenders have completed the course, they can access further training and support to help them re-enter the jobs market. Tony, who has just one GCSE after being kicked out of school when he was 15, wants to be a builder. Once he has the certificate from this course, he can apply for a Construction Skills Certification Scheme card, which shows he is a competent construction worker. He is spending the rest of his order outside, laying turf for the council. Which brings us to the big question: isn't all this sitting in a classroom and talking about your feelings stuff a bit of a skive compared with having to get your hands dirty working in the community? Not according to Peter Sedden, manager of the Bolton and Wigan Unpaid Work Units. It was his idea to pilot these classes in Bolton, after being impressed with the results the courses reaped in custody. He insists: \"It's not just sitting in a warm classroom - they've got to work hard and use their brains. And unpaid work isn't just about hard graft, but also about rehabilitation and trying to equip people with the skills they need to participate in society and get jobs.\" Whether it works or not, we won't know for some time. But it's certainly popular with the Bolton offenders - if only, as Tony puts it, because: \"It's better than being outside in the cold digging, isn't it?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
