The words of Falconer, the Constitutional Affairs Secretary, follow repeated controversy over the present Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith's legal advice on the war in Iraq, his role in stopping the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged slush fund payments by the defence firm BAE to Saudi officials. Goldsmith's future role in advising whether any prosecutions are likely over the alleged sale of peerages should go ahead is now causing concern.. MPs on all parties are increasingly arguing that Goldsmith - acting sometimes in an independent judicial role and at others as a political member of the cabinet personally appointed by Tony Blair - is confusing for the public, undermines trust in his advice and risks conflicts of interest. Falconer used a private lecture at Brasenose College, Oxford, last week to outline new thinking on constitutional reform, including the possibility of drawing up a form of written constitution - and more controversially, changes to the role of the attorney general. He told The Observer it was right for all options to be looked at, including making the attorney general independently appointed to avoid allegations of cronyism, adding: 'It's very difficult to see the status quo as being maintainable. We need to see what are the alternatives. I'm conscious of the fact that some of the things that an attorney general does are, in fact, conclusive on particular issues, such as whether a prosecution stops, which is a matter that has to be done independently of political considerations.' Asked whether Goldsmith should stand aside from any decision about prosecutions over cash for honours, he declined to support the attorney general's previous insistence that he has no choice but to preside over the matter, adding: 'It's obviously a matter for him to decide.' Gordon Brown is already known to be considering radical reforms to the attorney general's role to restore public trust if he becomes Prime Minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
