The newspaper concerned is edited by a man with links to the wealthy media owners the Barclay brothers. Police on Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, have investigated allegations made by people who live on neighbouring Sark and the case file is currently under review, the Guardian has learned. A newspaper called the Sark Newsletter has made frequent and scathing attacks on the government, individual members and islanders it believes are sympathetic to the administration. It is owned, edited and published by Kevin Delaney, chief executive officer of Sark Estate Management, which runs businesses owned by the Barclay family on the island. Lawyers for Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, owners of the Telegraph newspapers and Ritz hotel, who have a home on the islet of Brecqhou just off Sark, said on Thursday that the brothers had \u201cno input or influence\u201d over the newspaper\u2019s content. The Sark Newsletter \u2013 recently rebranded as the Sark Newspaper \u2013 has compared the government, known as the chief pleas, to \u201cfascist Germany in the 1930s\u201d, claiming the island is controlled by a \u201ctotalitarian one ruling party regime\u201d that is wrecking Sark\u2019s economy. Sark is a popular holiday island where cars are banned. It featured on the BBC\u2019s An Island Parish series. However, it is portrayed in the paper as a haven for criminals. It had alleged that one islander tried to obtain Delaney\u2019s fingerprints so they could be planted at a crime scene. A frequent target of the paper is Michael Beaumont, who as seigneur was effectively lord of the island before Sark held its first democratic elections in 2008 after more than 400 years of feudalism. The newspaper continues to characterise him as Sark\u2019s \u201cunelected feudal lord\u201d. Beaumont revealed he had complained to the police, but declined to comment further. Guernsey police confirmed it had investigated complaints from residents relating to alleged criminal harassment by the newspaper. It said its officers and the law officers on the island \u2013 the equivalent of the UK Crown Prosecution Service \u2013 were reviewing the files. A spokesman said: \u201cI can confirm we have received complaints from some Sark residents about the Sark newspaper. These are being reviewed.\u201d The islanders concerned are being represented by a Dublin law firm, Eames Solicitors. They have also been advised by a leading human rights barrister in London. In a statement, Eames said: \u201cWe can confirm that a large number of written complaints relating to the Sark Newsletter and made by residents of Sark have been formally lodged with the Guernsey police and the law officers. The matter is now in the hands of the Guernsey police and the law officers.\u201d One resident who is a constant target of the paper and has complained to police, Rosie Guille, said the allegations had a \u201chuge impact on morale\u201d on the island. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s blighted my life and the lives of my family.\u201d She has been described in the paper as a \u201cone ruling party fundamentalist\u201d. Explaining why she would not be driven away, Byrne, an artist and member of the government, said: \u201cMy family have lived here for 450 years. It\u2019s my home.\u201d Another Sark resident, who has made complaints to the police but has asked not to be named, said: \u201cThe situation has become unbearable. We are subjected to a weekly onslaught of abuse and vitriol by the Sark Newsletter. We had no alternative but to make a complaint to the Guernsey police.\u201d The allegations are not the only controversy swirling around Sark. Last week Delaney said hotels and other businesses on Sark owned by Sark Island Hotels, a subsidiary of Sark Estate Management, would not open next year or \u201cfor any foreseeable period after that\u201d \u2013 a blow for the island\u2019s tourist industry. In its latest edition, the paper blames the government for the closures. It claims a \u201ccatastrophic collapse\u201d in the island\u2019s economy has been caused by the refusal of the government to set up a customs post, which it argues would encourage more tourism from France. The government emphasised on Thursday that the island remained very much open \u2013 but declined to reply to the paper\u2019s claims. Delaney replied to the Guardian\u2019s queries through a lawyer, Gordon Dawes, who wrote that Delaney believed the \u201cvast majority\u201d of complainants were \u201csupporters of the single ruling party in Sark posing as ordinary members of the public\u201d. The lawyer\u2019s letter claimed their actions were part of a \u201cconcerted attempt\u201d to close down Sark\u2019s only newspaper and \u201conly effective political opposition\u201d. It added: \u201cPrevious efforts have included a march organised by single ruling party members on Mr Delaney\u2019s workplace in order to bully him into closing down his publication. Mr Delaney has, additionally, been subjected to attacks on his property, the setting of explosive fireworks outside his home and office, abuse by mail and online graffiti and even the creation of a mock grave.\u201d Dawes wrote: \u201cMr Delaney is the sole proprietor and editor of the Sark Newspaper. Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay have no input in its content. He sees his role as editor of the Sark Newspaper as being in the best traditions of pamphleteers of the 18th and 19th centuries. \u201cHe has lived on Sark for seven and a half years and, from a purely personal perspective, now sees his primary role as proprietor and editor of the Sark Newspaper exposing the government of Sark weekly, holding up a mirror to the actions of those who seek to control Sark, in the interests of transparency, openness, accountability and, most of all, in the public interest. He seeks to expose the feudal system and the fact that Sark is not a democracy.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cMr Delaney points out that this is not mere parish politics. Sark is what amounts to a micro state with the power to make primary legislation in all areas of Sark life. It has the same legislative powers over domestic matters as the Westminster parliament. This is why these matters are so important to anyone living on Sark.\u201d A letter from London law firm Carter-Ruck on behalf of the Barclay brothers said: \u201cThe Sark Newspaper is owned, edited and published by Kevin Delaney. Neither Sir David or Sir Frederick Barclay has any input or influence over its content. Mr Delaney is employed as chief executive officer of Sark Estate Management.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2014 to clarify that the Sark Newsletter compared the government to \u201cfascist Germany in the 1930s\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
