McCleary, who scored the second of Reading\u2019s three goals during a convincing 3-0 victory, complained to an assistant following an incident five minutes before half-time. The information was then passed on to the game\u2019s fourth official, Andre Marriner, who relayed the complaint to a Reading security official. McCleary was preparing to take a corner in front of the Bradford City supporters when the alleged abuse occurred. A Reading spokesman said: \u201cAn incident was reported to the match officials just before half time, who in turn told Reading staff. A man was then arrested and ejected during the half-time interval.\u201d The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, did not know the details when questioned after the match, although he was aware an incident had taken place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
