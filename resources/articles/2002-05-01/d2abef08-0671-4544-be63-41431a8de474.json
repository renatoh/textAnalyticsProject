The little genius of English rugby. He's an exceptional player, a true match maker and breaker. I'd put Michael Horak of London Irish not far behind him - he's had a great season for them, and as a man to watch for the future, our own Adryan Winnan, who is likely to make an impact for England at some point. 14+11: Inga Tuigamala (Newcastle) and Fereti 'Freddie' Tuilagi (Leicester). I'd have two players of the same type on the wings, and I'd rather have a picture of them on my mantelpiece than see either of these two running at me on a rugby pitch. I was reminded of Inga the Winger's awesome ability the other week at Newcastle; he was like a man among boys. I gather he's going back to Samoa at the end of this season, so this is the moment to pay tribute to all he's done for British rugby in the last few years. 12 + 13: Brendan Venter and Geoff Appleford (both London Irish). Venter has had a huge season on the pitch, and off it he's coached the Exiles to a superb Cup win and a place in Europe. He has directed them in playing some beautiful rugby. As for Appleford, he really surprised me in the final. He's a player with massive potential. What's surprising me about him is his speed. He's just what you need to exploit the gaps that Venter creates: a man to make the holes, and a man to use them. 10: Jonny Wilkinson (Newcastle). The King: the best fly-half in the world and he shows it every weekend, for his club as well as for his country. Disgustingly good at everything he does and a nice guy, too. One of the greats. 9: Bryan Redpath (Sale). He's had a huge season for his club, and has been highly influential in what can only be described as a new start for them. His style has evolved as he has reached maturity as a player. He's more open in his play, less dependent on his forwards, and that is what has made the difference. 1: Phil Vickery (Gloucester): Robocop. You can't help feeling that he was programmed at birth to play in the front row. He's a great tackler, great scrummager and is superb with the ball in hand. He'll be a good captain for England this summer. He's not a guy who says a lot, but he makes what he says count. 2: Trevor Leota (Wasps). The house-mover. When he comes past at speed, it's like watching a tornado; players just topple like so many trees going down. He's a dangerous man, in the sense that he creates openings everywhere. He also has the instinct for getting just where the ball is, which is what makes the difference between a good player and a great one. 3: Graham Rowntree (Leicester). If he was a wine, he'd be Chateau Margaux, so much has he improved as he has got older. A lot of power going forward, a rock in defence, and he's got faster as he has aged. You can't win without the ball and, together with the next two players, Rowntree has won a lot of the ball which has won Leicester the Premiership. 4: Ben Kay (Leicester). He's been the revelation of the last two years. The archetype of the modern front row: powerful, strong and fast. 5: Martin Johnson (Leicester). The champions' captain yet again. The facts speak for themselves: he has led his club to a fourth title, has taken them to the brink of a second successive European Cup, and has captained his country. 6: Epi Taione (Newcastle). Best impact player in the back row: when he runs at you, you have the impression that you've just got in the way of a juggernaut. 7: Neil Back (Leicester). As the best ball-winner in the world, he would complement Taione. He would also snaffle any odd bits of ball that Rowntree, Kay and Johnson fail to pick up. 8: Lawrence Dallaglio (Wasps). If Back is Mr Turnover, Lawrence is Monsieur Plus, as we say in France, the player who guarantees you a certain edge. You just have to look at the turnaround at Wasps since he returned to action to see how special he is. Managers : Dean Richards and Brendan Venter. Richards for yet another title with Leicester, Venter for creating something from very little at London Irish. Compare and contast his achievement with Richards' given the history and continuity at Leicester, and for creating it quickly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
