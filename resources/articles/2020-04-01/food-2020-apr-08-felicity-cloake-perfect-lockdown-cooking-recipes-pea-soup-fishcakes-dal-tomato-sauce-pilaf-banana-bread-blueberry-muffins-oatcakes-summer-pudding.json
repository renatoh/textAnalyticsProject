Store-cupboard roulette is my favourite kind of cooking: for those of us fortunate enough to have such reserves, it\u2019s a challenge in which there are no losers \u2013 after all, how bad can macaroni cheese be, even if the macaroni is actually Bob the Builder pasta and the cheese comes wrapped in jaunty red wax? Frankly, this is no time to worry about perfection; enjoyably edible is what I\u2019m aiming for right now. So, though the recipes listed below \u2013 selected to use as few fresh ingredients as possible \u2013 may come with the tagline \u201cPerfect\u201d, don\u2019t be afraid to muck about to adapt them to what you have to hand. That\u2019s how some of the world\u2019s best-loved dishes came about, after all. Just think, you could be creating a future classic\u2026 Banana bread Well, we\u2019re all making this now, aren\u2019t we? Fishcakes Use frozen or tinned fish (no need to cook it, if so), if that\u2019s all you have \u2013 no one will judge you and they\u2019ll still taste ace. Pea soup Pea season is imminent, but there\u2019s nowt wrong with frozen, if that\u2019s all you can get your hands on. Dal What store cupboards are made for. Pilaf One of the great mix-and-match classics out there. Tomato sauce Channel your inner nonna with this quintessential pasta sauce; it\u2019s a great one for batch cooking and freezing, too. Gratin dauphinois There are no hard and fast rules to cooking, so use creme fraiche instead of cream, and swap the gruy\u00e8re for whatever you\u2019ve got to hand. Blueberry muffins Fresh or frozen fruit: who can really tell the difference once it\u2019s baked? Oatcakes Just add butter and Marmite. Or is that just me? Summer pudding What applies to blueberry muffins also applies here: use whatever frozen, jarred or tinned berries or cherries you can find."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
