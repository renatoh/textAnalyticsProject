Berman later confirmed he had stepped down and that his deputy Audrey Strauss would take his place. \u201cI could leave the district in no better hands than Audrey\u2019s,\u201d Berman said in a statement. He added that he was sure Strauss would continue the district\u2019s \u201ctradition of integrity and independence\u201d. It brings to an end a bizarre dispute between the attorney general and Berman, after Berman earlier refused to confirm his resignation from the prestigious role, following Barr\u2019s announcement in a surprise statement on Friday night. That refusal prompted Barr to announce he had asked Trump to fire Berman \u2013 which the president apparently promptly did. Before Barr moved to fire Berman, observers widely noted that though the attorney general did not have the authority to do so, the president did. Characteristically, Trump appeared to muddy already murky waters. Leaving the White House for his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told reporters the firing was \u201call up to the attorney general. Attorney General Barr is working on that. That\u2019s his department, not my department. But we have a very capable attorney general, so that\u2019s really up to him. I\u2019m not involved.\u201d Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas, said on Twitter that more important than questions about legal authority was \u201cthe much bigger question is why this happened\u201d. Barr had been widely accused of undermining Department of Justice independence even before he moved against Berman. In a surprise statement released on Friday night, Barr said Trump intended to nominate Jay Clayton \u2013 the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission but with little experience as a federal prosecutor \u2013 as US attorney. Barr said then the US attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, would be acting US attorney until Clayton could be confirmed by the Senate. In response, Berman said he had not known of the move until Barr\u2019s statement was issued. \u201cI will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption. \u201cI cherish every day that I work with the men and women of this office to pursue justice without fear or favor \u2013 and intend to ensure that this office\u2019s important cases continue unimpeded.\u201d On Saturday, Berman showed up to work in Manhattan. \u201cI\u2019m just here to do my job,\u201d he said. He did not immediately comment after Barr moved to have him fired. Barr accused Berman of having \u201cchosen public spectacle over public service\u201d. \u201cYour statement also wrongly implies that your continued tenure in the office is necessary to ensure that cases now pending in the southern district of New York are handled appropriately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is obviously false. I fully expect that the office will continue to handle all cases in the normal course.\u201d Berman was not confirmed by the Senate but appointed by district judges until a Senate-confirmed nominee was found, according to law and after Trump fired the previous US attorney, Preet Bharara, an Obama appointee. In a tweet on Saturday, Bharara mocked Barr\u2019s letter as a \u201cwrinkle\u201d. \u201cThe president just said that he was not involved in the matter of Geoff Berman in SDNY,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat means that though both Trump and Barr lie, at least one of them is lying about who is firing Berman.\u201d Berman has overseen investigations into Giuliani\u2019s business dealings \u2013 no wrongdoing has been formally alleged \u2013 and campaign finance violations which contributed to Cohen going to jail. The SDNY is also overseeing the prosecution of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of Giuliani, on campaign finance charges. Parnas has turned against Trump. On Saturday ABC News released a section of a forthcoming interview in which John Bolton, the former national security adviser whose tell-all book will be published on Tuesday despite Trump\u2019s attempt to stop it, said the president\u2019s suggested intervention in an SDNY case involving a Turkish bank \u201cdid feel like obstruction of justice to me\u201d. The southern district is an immensely powerful office, often charged with prosecuting financial, organised crime and terror-related cases. Berman oversaw the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who counted Trump among influential friends and who killed himself in custody in New York last year. Among Democrats, Val Demings, a US representative from Florida and a possible pick as Joe Biden\u2019s presidential running mate, promised Congress would establish the reason for Berman\u2019s dismissal. \u201cWhat was Mr Berman investigating that the president and his fixer are so determined to stop?\u201d she said in a tweet. \u201cWe are going to find out.\u201d That followed another tweet in which she said: \u201cThe president has doubled down on his fixer\u2019s obstruction of investigations into him and his allies. It is clear that nothing will restrain his corruption. No one is above the law. The American people will have their say.\u201d Letitia James, the New York attorney general, issued a hard-hitting statement. \u201cI am deeply concerned about the sudden removal of the US attorney for the southern district of New York, especially given serious questions about who gave the order and the timing of the firing,\u201d James said. \u201cI hope the Department of Justice heeds its own advice and puts public service over public spectacle. Ongoing investigations must not be interfered with, period. There is still much work to be done and it must be done independently. Americans deserve leaders who are committed to justice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
