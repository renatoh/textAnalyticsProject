Lamo, who testified about Manning\u2019s release of documents to WikiLeaks, was confirmed dead on Friday by authorities in Sedgwick County. The coroner\u2019s office has not responded to inquiries about the cause of his death. Manning, a former soldier whose leaks exposed the nature of warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, was released from military prison last year after Barack Obama commuted her 35-year sentence. Lamo had met Manning online in 2010 and eventually reported her to the authorities. Manning had reached out to Lamo after reading an article about the hacker, who was convicted in 2004 of breaking into computers at the New York Times, Yahoo and Microsoft. Lamo\u2019s father, Mario, confirmed the death in a Facebook post on Friday that said: \u201cWith great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian\u2019s friends and acquittances [sic] that he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone, he was my beloved son.\u201d In a 2011 interview with the Guardian, Lamo had expressed some regret about a possible lengthy prison sentence for Manning. He said he thought of Manning \u201cevery day\u201d, adding: \u201cThe decision was not one I decided to make, but was thrust upon me.\u201d Called the \u201cworld\u2019s most hated hacker\u201d by some at the time, Lamo also said: \u201cHad I done nothing, I would always have been left wondering whether the hundreds of thousands of documents that had been leaked to unknown third parties would end up costing lives, either directly or indirectly.\u201d Lamo also spoke to the Guardian in 2013 about Manning\u2019s harsh treatment behind bars, saying: \u201cI came to terms and continued my life some time ago.\u201d Manning, who was one of the most severely punished leakers in US history, announced earlier this year that she is running for US Senate. She came out as a transgender woman while incarcerated and has been an advocate for trans rights since."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
