The full-back departed the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday having reached a fifth European Cup final, with three different clubs. Waiting for him in Germany will be the side that twice beat Manchester United in the final and the man who was banned for eight games for racially abusing him while playing for Liverpool after the teams met in the Premier League in October 2011. Evra insisted that the battle between them will be restricted to the game itself. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter; the most important thing is that I play in the final,\u201d Evra said. \u201cI am proud to be what I am, I am proud about my colour, and I will shake his hand, it is no problem. But I will make sure he will feel me on the pitch.\u201d Su\u00e1rez is also set to come up against the Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, whom he bit in a World Cup match last summer while playing for Uruguay against Italy. Su\u00e1rez was punished with a nine-match suspension from international matches and a four-month ban from all football-related activities. Juventus knocked out Real Madrid 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final and Evra said that the unexpected nature of that result means that while Barcelona are the favourites, Juve will travel to their first final in 12 years believing that they can beat the Catalans. The full-back described it as \u201cDavid versus Goliath,\u201d but then few expected the Italian club to even get this far. \u201cOf course, of course [we can beat them]\u201d, Evra said. \u201cThey are human beings. People forget, on Juventus\u2019 team a lot of players have already won the Champions League. There are players who have played in finals, like myself. This is my fifth final. You never know. I believe in everything because if I didn\u2019t believe we can win against Barcelona, I would ask the manager not to play me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough game, David versus Goliath. But you never know. In football anything can happen. In Monaco we had our most difficult game, and against Madrid everyone thought they would win. That is where you see the great character and personality of the Juventus players.\u201d Evra added: \u201cBarcelona is still Barcelona. I think against Manchester [United in 2009 and 2011] they were more a team, a very strong team,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow they have three players in the front, Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez, that can make the difference. You can be strong like in the last five, 10 minutes [against Madrid] but these three players can score any time. You have to be ready. \u201cWe worked really hard. You have to congratulate the boss because tactically he\u2019s really, really good. Game by game we believed we could do something big this year. I don\u2019t know if people believed we\u2019d make the final. But every time I play this competition I\u2019m really confident to go to the final, like I did with Monaco, with Manchester and now with Juve. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really realised. People said \u2018It\u2019s your fifth final\u2019; I don\u2019t realise. The most important is I don\u2019t want to lose another one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
