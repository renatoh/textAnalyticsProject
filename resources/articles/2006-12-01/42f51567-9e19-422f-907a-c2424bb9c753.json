Their site states the following: ACT is Interactive Activism: \u2022 We use technology to reject the standard excuse of inaction - ignorance \u2022 We debunk the myth that ordinary people cannot stop genocide \u2022 We replace statistics with names, faces and stories The age of bystanders should long have passed - we have entered an age of knowledge which empowers us to protect. Join us as an upstander. Become an i-ACTivist. They have sent two \"citizen journalists\" to Darfur. It is an interesting use of the technology that we are all using here on Comment is free. Whether or not you think genocide is taking place, it will be worth watching their site over the next 14 days as these two young Americans blog and send back video of their visit. I have nothing but admiration for their energy and drive. The use of the internet for this kind of action is also clever. That it is necessary for this to take place reflects badly on the world's ability to fulfil our responsibility to protect. You could say that there is an element here of atrocity tourism. I think this is overly harsh. They have given up their time and money to contribute to raising awareness of what is happening in Darfur and they will provide witness accounts and interviews with people on the ground. While many of us read and talk about this stuff everyday, many more are blissfully unaware of what is going on so any media that draws attention to what is happening should be applauded. Let's see what they see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
