Thanks for your company throughout the course of a pulsating World Cup clash. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow in Bristol. Goodnight from Trent Bridge. That\u2019s a fine win. To salute at a World Cup you need to find a way to win ugly on days when the top order folds, as Australia\u2019s did so spectacularly this morning when the board read 38/4 then 79/5. But through Smith, with support from Carey, they got back on track. Then Coulter-Nile arrived. In more ways than one. He\u2019s closer to 32 than 31 now - it has been a long time coming - but he repaid all that faith, shown through all those injury layoffs, today at Trent Bridge. His 92 from 60 deliveries at number eight will be remembered for a long time. With the ball, it was a frenetic first power play, where Gayle was twice reprieved by DRS before Starc finally had his man leg before. Indeed, DRS saved the Windies on four occasions during their ill-fated chase. They should have done it easy. They were doing it easy. But then Starc was brought back at the perfect time by Starc on two occasions, good enough to force an error from Russell to open the window. Back again for over 45, Brathwaite and Holder completed a matchwinning burst. Coulter-Nile has been rightly named man of the match, but it was Starc (and Finch) wh stuck the landing. After all that has gone down in Australian cricket over the last 18 months, this will be viewed as an important day on their way back. Helluva win. 50th over: West Indies 273-9 (Nurse 19, Thomas 0) Target 289 Nurse pulls then lashes then hoicks then drives four boundaries off Coulter-Nile, which is a tad unfair given how important the West Australian was to this Australian victory. But it mattes little, as they have got the job done. A fantastic fighting win for Australia. 49th over: West Indies 257-9 (Nurse 3, Thomas 0) Target 289 For reasons that make no sense to me, Nurse is turning down singles until the penultimate ball, where he is denied a boundary by a super bit of fielding from NCN and Maxwell on the rope. He needs to hit 32 off Coulter-Nile\u2019s 50th over, in case you\u2019re wondering. 48th over: West Indies 256-9 (Nurse 2, Thomas 0) Target 289 Starc at his best, reverse swing so lethal at his pace. Thomas somehow keeps out the last couple but the job is done 10-1-46-5 is his final analysis. 33 from 12 balls is the highly unlikely equation for the West Indies now. They\u2019ve had a shocker at the death. Bowled him! Five or Starc! Three at the death. Cottrell backed away to try something but the full yorker was on target, bending back his middle stump. Another World Cup bag for the man of the tournament four years ago. 47th over: West Indies 255-8 (Nurse 2, Cottrell 1) Target 289 Marcus Stoinis is back on now, which isn\u2019t unusual - he\u2019s bowled plenty of death overs for Australia in the last year or so. Nurse is having a terrible time of it, unable to make meaningful contact at any stage, saved from a lbw dismissal with an inside edge. The new pair manage to scrape three singles from it, leaving 34 to win in 18 balls. Oh my, how the West Indies have thown this away. Holder out hooking! Starc\u2019s follows up another slower full toss with a quicker bumper, the West Indian captain taking the bait and helping the ball on its way to Zampa at short fine leg! Two wickets in the over; two wickets with the score on 252. Holder walks off slowly, gutted, realising that his team might have tossed this all away in the space of five deliveries. 46th over: West Indies 252-8 (Nurse 0) Target 289 Starc takes two balls to get the breakthrough! Great captaincy from Finch to bowl him out now rather than waiting. The wicket comes from a low, slower-ball full toss aimed right at the base of middle stump - nothing wrong with that. Brathwaite can\u2019t get it over Finch, running back from mid-on to take a safe chance above his head. What a wonderful game this has been with twist after twist. 45th over: West Indies 251-6 (Holder 50, Brathwaite 16) Target 289 Cummins starts his final over and Brathwaite takes him on with a horizontal bat down the ground, clearing mid-off and reaching the rope. He\u2019s up and about now. There is a run out chance when he picks out Warner at mid-on and gallops to the danger end but the Australian opener can\u2019t execute an unlikely direct hit. Cummins doesn\u2019t stop, banging in short to Holder with a rapid bouncer to finish. 10-3-41-2 is his return - a fine job across four spells. West Indies need 38 from 30. 44th over: West Indies 243-6 (Holder 50, Brathwaite 9) Target 289 The captain pulls hard to midwicket for one, raising his half-century in the same number of balls, giving the strike back to Brathwaite... who breaks the shackles with a GIANT SIX! Coulter-Nile went for the bouncer with three men back but Carlos took him on anyway, not all that far from hitting it out of the stadium. What a time for it! 43rd over: West Indies 233-6 (Holder 47, Brathwaite 2) Target 289 Cummins turn for a frugal over, just one from it. They are fighting back really well here, showing all their experience with the ball. What a competitor Cummins is. Menawhile, Brathwaite is 2 off 10 balls, really stuggling to get down the other end. Holder might have to consider milking the strike a bit here. But they have ample time. \u201cBrother Collins.\u201d I\u2019m a bit late on Robert Wilson\u2019s second email, but I am going to publish it anyway. \u201cBold prediction time. If they don\u2019t get Holder out in the next five overs, they\u2019re done. I know I risk coming off all creepy and stalker-like with my outsized Holder-love but I need your guidance. I know it\u2019s fine to admire, to esteem and to approbate, but how bad is it that I am now starting to idly doodle his name on my schoolbag and wistfully wondering if he ever thinks about me?\u201d 42nd over: West Indies 232-6 (Holder 46, Brathwaite 2) Target 289 Excellent over from Coulter-Nile, using his changes of pace wisely to prevent Brathwaite or Holder freeing up their arms, beating the bat twice along the way. The seven runs an over West Indies require should not be an issue... but still. Starc next? 41st over: West Indies 230-6 (Holder 45, Brathwaite 1) Target 289 Zampa has been shuffled back to the pavilion end for his tenth and final over of what has been a wild ride for him today. Holder makes sure it is a good one for the Windies, leaping into a full delivery, smacking it to the short boundary at extra cover. Whaddashot! Zampa gets back into the over and wins a genuine outside edge but there is nobody at slip, so another four runs are added to the total. So close for Australia. Instead, their task gets that little bit tougher. The spinner finishes with 10-0-58-1. 40th over: West Indies 221-6 (Holder 37, Brathwaite 0) Target 289 Dot, dot, dot, dot... SLAP! It\u2019s been the order of the day, the West Indian batsmen electing to go at the fifth an sixth balls. Holder\u2019s pull shot off NCN gives the sweeper at midwicket no chance despite only having 15 metres to make up. Still, four off works for Finch and co. MIDNIGHT OIL playing over the PA at the end of the over. \u201cWonder how many of these decisions would have been made in favour of Aus if WI had no reviews still available?\u201d ponders Brian Withington. \u201cGayle\u2019s third (unsuccessful) review was only retained on a narrow margin, so we might have been looking at a clutch of shockers if the umpires are genuinely not influenced by such considerations. Not sure I\u2019d trust this pair with directions to the pavillion though.\u201d Fair point. Very different game today if DRS isn\u2019t involved. 39th over: West Indies 217-6 (Holder 33, Brathwaite 0) Target 289 A lesson for Starc: aim at the woodwork. If he can direct 10 of his remaining 12 balls there, well, you do the math. 72 needed from 66 balls. WHAT A CATCH! Glenn Maxwell! Running back with the flight, into the sun, a million miles in the air... and he\u2019s pouched it! Starc aimed at the stumps to force the error, Russell making room and miscuing. But WHAT A CATCH! The Australians celebrate accordingly, realising that with that wicket they are alive! 38th over: West Indies 210-5 (Holder 32, Russell 11) Target 289 Zampa to Russell, can he force a false stroke? Not from the first ball, the West Indies all-rounder heeeeeeeaving it for SIX! Nothing wrong with the ball but Russell is just too good; too clean. He goes again, one bounce over the rope straight down the ground. 12 from the over. Forget 50 overs, if Australia can\u2019t break this partnership in the next over or two, the Windies are winning this in 45 and collecting some NRR. 37th over: West Indies 198-5 (Holder 31, Russell 0) Target 289 Starc has to hit some stumps with yorkers. He has to find the 2015 version of himself and slip through the gate of the lower order. Surely, he has to do that. Now. Nup. Not this over. After a couple of length balls, he goes for the bumper and Holder says I\u2019ll have a bit of that. Sure, it\u2019s a bit top-edgey, but it\u2019s easily over the rope in front of us in the press box... SIX RUNS! Right, back to Starc who surely will go for the toes this time and... No! It\u2019s another bouncer! Happy with his lot from the previous delivery, Holder gets ducks under it. This doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. 36th over: West Indies 191-5 (Holder 24, Russell 0) Target 289 Holding is also annoyed with Zampa/Australia for multiple appeals. After being denied the wicket, Zampa holds his nerve for the remainder of the over, Holder grabbing a single but nothing further. That helps. Russell opts not to try and smack the first ball out of the ground. He looked quite sore earlier today in that right knee, but I\u2019m sure his job will be clearing the rope rather than galloping between the wickets. NOT OUT! Would you believe it! Yes, Zampa\u2019s toppie is pitching in line with leg stump but it is sliding down! That\u2019s four overturned decisions and a fifth where Gayle was confirmed as out but the review was retained. It must be a record. \u201cThe umpiring in this game has been atrocious,\u201d says Mikey Holding on TV. IS HOLDER LBW TO ZAMPA? Once again, he has been given out. One again, DRS has been called upon. Can it save another Windies batsman? Let\u2019s find out! Ooooh, no. Shai! A nothing delivery on his pads to end the over, a nothing shot - a lazy shot - the ball the landing in the hands of Khawaja at mid-on. A leading edge, the end of his long stand. Game on again, which is entirely right given the way this contest has jumped around all day long. Enter Andre Russell. Whoa. 35th over: West Indies 190-5 (Holder 23) Target 289 34th over: West Indies 188-4 (Hope 67, Holder 22) Target 289 That really hurts Australia, Holder launching into the first ball through cover for four and enjoying it so much that he repeats the shot from the next delivery with the same result! With eight off the first two, they\u2019re happy enough with a couple of additional singles on offer to the sweepers down the ground. I suspect Zampa will be back next from this end. They have to find a way through soon... or this is over. 33rd over: West Indies 178-4 (Hope 66, Holder 13) Target 289 The story of the middle overs for Australia, Cummins doing it nicely until ball five when Hope finds a way to find the rope. It is resourceful batting, jumping around in his crease across his stumps to open up the legside. This is Hope\u2019s match to win from here. I missed this earlier. No good. WHEN WILL NO-BALLS BE AUTOMATED? The ICC have the tech, they used it in a bilateral series between England and Pakistan in 2016. They say that they can\u2019t afford it. But for a World Cup? Hmmmm. 32nd over: West Indies 173-4 (Hope 62, Holder 12) Target 289 Six from Maxwell\u2019s over, collected with three twos from Hope, to deep point then extra cover then fine leg. Clever batting, striking just wide of the sweepers. Maxwell is through five overs for 21. He might need to bowl a few more yet. In saying that, I doubt Finch will assume this is going to 50. Australia will have to win this with wickets. 31st over: West Indies 167-4 (Hope 56, Holder 12) Target 289 Speaking of Cummins, he is back into the attack from the pavilion end. Going short at Holder at the first opportunity but the 6\u20196\u201d skipper isn\u2019t so worried, timing it beautifully off his hip through midwicket for his second boundary. Three singles makes seven from the over, the required rate still hovering around a comfortable 6.5 an over. 30th over: West Indies 160-4 (Hope 54, Holder 7) Target 289 Would you believe, a maiden for Maxwell. It wasn\u2019t the best over early on but Holder failed to make the most of it before his close-call lbw moment. What happens next?! \u201cI\u2019ve got a soft spot for Pat Cummins,\u201d emails David Nottingham. \u201cHe\u2019s bowled well and he\u2019s been signing autographs in the outfield. Not such a fan of Starc seeing as I was looking forward to a Gayle masterclass.\u201d Yep, you\u2019re spot on with your character assessment of Pat - he\u2019s a wonderful fella. Mind you, they\u2019re all pretty good with autographs and selfies these days, I reckon. NOT OUT! DRS shows it is just pitching outside leg. Holder survives. It looked out in real time - Holder missing his sweep with Maxwell operating around the wicket - but he\u2019s been saved. West Indies have used DRS four times today and still have the chance to use it again if they need it later. Wonderful drama. HAS MAXWELL PICKED UP HOLDER LBW? He has been given! But the West Indies captain is taking it to the DRS! 29th over: West Indies 160-4 (Hope 54, Holder 7) Target 289 Spin twins, with Zampa now the third Australian bowler to begin at the broadcast end only to shift to the pavilion end. He took some tap from his previous over and does again here, Holder getting deep enough in the crease to carve away a marginally shorter delivery. After that start, five further runs are taken without risk to the sweepers. A run a ball for 21 overs won\u2019t bother the Windies. Australia must bowl them out. 28th over: West Indies 151-4 (Hope 51, Holder 1) Target 289 In comes the skipper. Hopes gives him the strike and he\u2019s off the mark with a push through cover to keep the strike. This is anyone\u2019s game. Don\u2019t go anywhere. From NOWHERE! Maxwell into the attack and from his second ball Hope strikes hard off the back foot to Cummins at mid-off on the circle, prompting Hetmyer to charge down towards him. Realising there isn\u2019t a single there, Hope sends him back but it is too late. The Cummins throw to Maxwell sees him short by metres. Goodness me, what a pulsating game of cricket this is! 27th over: West Indies 149-3 (Hope 50, Hetmyer 21) Target 289 Another big over, two boundaries added for Hope off NCN! The first is a simple glance off his pads from a ball without much on it, the next is an outstanding straight drive with the man up inside the circle at mid-off. Hope to 50 off 76 balls with one to midwicket to finish. 38 runs from the last five overs, 11 from this one. 26th over: West Indies 138-3 (Hope 39, Hetmyer 21) Target 289 Ooooh! Zampa is bowling googly after googly at Hetmyer, beating him twice with balls that evade the outside edge. In response, to the final delivery, the left-hander gets down low to sweep the wrong\u2019un and makes great contact - another four! Smith at slip has his hands on his head, suggesting that this was hit-and-hope stuff. But it doesn\u2019t matter because they are keeping the board ticking heathily during every over now. 25th over: West Indies 133-3 (Hope 38, Hetmyer 17) Target 289 Coulter-Nile does replace Starc, which feels like a good idea. But it doesn\u2019t change the trend of the last few overs, Hetmyer smacking a short delivery to the rope at midwicket after the pair rotated the strike easily enough to begin. Boundaries in six of the last eight overs, by my quick scan. That\u2019s all they need to do. \u201cRegardless of the result of this game, it is evident that the Windies have got their mojo back,\u201d emails Nuggehalli Nigam. \u201cThey always had talent, but is there a precise point of time at which they got their self belief back?\u201d It is worth noting that they didn\u2019t qualify for the last global tournament, the Champions Trophy, and only made it into this one the hard way with Afghanistan. What a remarkable story it would be if they found a way to be there on the final day at Lord\u2019s on the 14th of July. A lot might hinge on the next hour. 24th over: West Indies 126-3 (Hope 36, Hetmyer 12) Target 289 Changing fortunes for Hope and Zampa, the former successful in putting away a full toss then a half-tracker. His gains have been hard won this afternoon so far, those just his third and fourth boundaries from 66 balls in the middle, but they\u2019ll help plenty. For Zampa\u2019s part, between the two four-balls he was up for an enthusiastic lbw appeal but an inside edge was clipped on the way through to the right-handers\u2019s front pad. 23rd over: West Indies 116-3 (Hope 27, Hetmyer 11) Target 289 Starc again, going short to Hetmyer, who needs no second inviation to climb into a pull shot, creamed into the boundary! Love that aggression. I suspect the attack-leader might be given a break, four overs up his sleeve to burst through the lower order. 22nd over: West Indies 111-3 (Hope 27, Hetmyer 6) Target 289 Outstanding middle-overs bowling from Zampa, his fourth over here going for three runs as well. His approach of attacking the stumps with plenty of overspin is working perfectly, neither batsmen willing to take on that kind of accuracy at this stage of the chase. \u201cAd.\u201d Paris Bob! \u201cAs always, classical myth shows us the way. Now that absurd statistical outlier (and destroyer of all moral narrative), Gayle is out, this becomes a classical Quest Story, an ordeal both hortatory and allegorical. It\u2019s all a bit zippy and dragonish out there and if the West Indies Argonauts get something out of this, it will be due to their very own Jason\u2019s wily and exemplary leadership. Of course, this means that Warner or Smith are the Golden Fleece in this analogy but judging by the crowd, everyone\u2019s very much up for a bit of post-match skinning. Starc looks up for it though. 21st over: West Indies 108-3 (Hope 27, Hetmyer 3) Target 289 Starc for a second go, his earlier spell of four overs including the wicket of Chris Gayle after twice having him given out and overturned in the space of three balls. As usual when the left-armer is on, plenty is happening. Initially, four leg byes from a yorker that isn\u2019t quite on target, Hetmyer getting his boot in the way. Next, a brilliant bumper that floors the new man. Then, a very wide ball down leg that isn\u2019t far away from beating the \u2018keeper for the second time in this innings. This is how it works with Starc in 2019 - take what you get, knowing his best is just about unplayable. 20th over: West Indies 102-3 (Hope 27, Hetmyer 2) Target 289 One young gun replaces another, Hetmyer off the mark first ball with one to square leg. Zampa busts out his biting wrong\u2019un to both batsmen before his successful set is done, nearly sneaking through Hope\u2019s gate then beating the new man\u2019s outside edge by a long way. Three runs and a wicket from it. Zampa has 1/9 from three. \u201cHope the Windies opener out in the middle stops being Shai and starts scoring the elegant runs which we know he can,\u201d requests OB Jato. \u201cAt some point, he\u2019ll start to more of a hindrance than an efficient anchor if he can\u2019t score the runs at a SR of 80+\u201d He\u2019s doing a good job in the Steve Smith role for now, but you\u2019re right, he has all the shots and I\u2019m looking forward to him rolling them out soon. Excellent cricket from the Australians, Zampa drawing Pooran into a miscued drive that the captain Finch takes running back with the flight at backward point with both feet off the ground. They give it big in the celebration, knowing that they needed to see the back of the classy left-hander. 19th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 26, Pooran 40) Target 289 Six added from Stoinis\u2019 second over thanks to another Hope boundary, once again taking on the short ball successfully, pulling behind square into the rope. He\u2019s going very well. 18th over: West Indies 93-2 (Hope 21, Pooran 39) Target 289 Zampa is right on top of Hope initially, attacking the leg stump line with his overspinners while mixing up his speed. But the moment he drops short, after four dots, Hope jumps back to crunch the legspinner into the gap at cover. There isn\u2019t much of a gap between the two sweepers there either - he\u2019s timed the pants off it. 17th over: West Indies 88-2 (Hope 16, Pooran 39) Target 289 Marcus Stoinis gets his first go of the day. He has an important role to play as Australia\u2019s fifth bowler, in combination with Maxwell. Pooran has a pop at the first short ball he sees from the all-rounder, a top edge off his big bat floating over the rope for six! Not the most convincing stroke but it is the first big one for the West Indies in their chase. They are right back on track now after a tough start. Stoinis recovers, two singles coming from his final four balls. 16th over: West Indies 80-2 (Hope 15, Pooran 32) Target 289 This is a big day for Adam Zampa, the first choice spinner. He does well to get down low to Pooran\u2019s straight drive, deflecting onto Hope\u2019s stumps but the third umpire confirms that he has made it back to his ground. Pooran went hard at him again later through cover and was (kinda) dropped! The reality is, Maxwell somehow got one hand to it and saved three runs. The replay confirms as much. Nice start from the leggie. 15th over: West Indies 78-2 (Hope 15, Pooran 31) Target 289 NCN has the final over before the drinks break and it is his best yet: three dots, three singles. We\u2019re right into the accumulation phase now. Australia needs another wicket soon, though. \u201cThere are many things on which I dwell,\u201d rhymes the ever thoughtful Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhat is the meaning of life? Why are we all here? And how do I keep loving Maxwell? This entire Australian team is the biggest mystery I\u2019ve ever seen. There are lots of podiums, lots of headlines, and lots of controversies in which they\u2019ve been. Finch, Starc, Cummins, Zampa, Khawaja, Warner, Smith and Tim Paine. One learns to admire them, then hate them, then love them again. About this side, a billion people have a billion things to say. But even at the end of the day, when it comes to the Australian cricket team one can never simply look away.\u201d Linked only to your chosen form, I participated in a rap song about India\u2019s search for a World Cup No4 the other day. I\u2019m sincerely hoping that it doesn\u2019t actually surface anywhere on the world wide web. The things we do for love cash. 14th over: West Indies 75-2 (Hope 13, Pooran 30) Target 289 Better from Maxwell, squeezing out an accurate over that cramped up Hope initially, the sweepers on posh side each found with three singles to complete the set. \u201cThose stumps are a sullen lot aren\u2019t they?\u201d according to Aditi Prabhudesai. \u201cIf a 147 kmph delivery can\u2019t sway them, what can? Perhaps the bowler, at the beginning of the run-up, can whisper some sweet-nothings to the ball. The white ball can then be the bearer of the glad tidings to the ruby stumps.\u201d It does seem to defy the laws of quantum physics (let\u2019s not pretend that I know what that means, but I was heavily influened by watching Quantum Leap as a kid) that it is possible for Starc to hit the stump only for the bails not to dislodge. 13th over: West Indies 72-2 (Hope 11, Pooran 29) Target 289 NCN\u2019s turn to be spun around to the Pavilion End, which must be the one the Aussie quicks fancy. And he prompts a false stroke immediately, the roar of caaaaaatch going up around the field before Hope\u2019s top edge falls in front of the man at long leg. They exchange singles to the man on the short boundary to finish; square leg for the left-handed Pooran, deep point when Hope is on strike. They need 5.89 an over from here. \u201cThe Win Predictor algorithm is going to need to lie down in the shade with a cool flannel after this game is done,\u201d Brian Withington adds. \u201cPossibly with a brace for whiplash injuries, too.\u201d Shaun Pollock noted during the previous over that WinViz has the game level at 50/50. Nice. Of course, never forget that it is a backward-looking measure, contrary to the misleading Win Predictor name that it has when used on telly. 12th over: West Indies 68-2 (Hope 9, Pooran 27) Target 289 Glenn Maxwell into the attack from the same end that Nurse bowled for the West Indies, operating around the wicket from our broadcast end. Pooran responds to the introduction of spin a pair of delightful shots, cutting hard to the short boundary - just beating Zampa - then driving inside-out for three out to deep cover. Really good batting. Hope isn\u2019t far away from getting four himself from the final delivery, just picking out the man at short cover with a well-struck crunch off the back foot. 10 runs off it. \u201cAll quiet on the Trent Bridge front,\u201d Brian Withington quips. Something like that. 11th over: West Indies 58-2 (Hope 7, Pooran 19) Target 289 Cummins gives up two runs in the middle of this over but they aren\u2019t off the bat, drifting down the legside at Hope then misdirecting a bumper too far over the right-hander\u2019s head. He\u2019s back locating that nagging area around Hope\u2019s ribs before sending a third wide of the over down, again beyond leg stump. That makes ten wides for the West Indies. 10th over: West Indies 54-2 (Hope 6, Pooran 19) Target 289 NCN sends down the final over of the power play, this time able to keep Pooran quiet with a much fuller line than in his first crack at him. When he does go short, the Windies young gun turns him around the corner with ease, Hope then timing two off his pads through midwicket. Nice batting. Oh, less so from the final ball when trying to repeat the stroke, a leading edge lucky not to go to hand behind the wicket. 9th over: West Indies 50-2 (Hope 3, Pooran 18) Target 289 Cummins has been swung around to the pavilion end to follow Starc. And races through a third maiden to go alongside the over where Gayle took him for three boundaries. Hope is the man down the business end, happy to play the Australian superstar with respect whether he\u2019s at the stumps or his helmet. One jumps off a length and whacks him in the thigh pad off the inside edge. That doesn\u2019t tickle. Top contest. 8th over: West Indies 50-2 (Hope 3, Pooran 18) Target 289 Nathan Coulter-Nile replaces Cummins, presumably to squeeze a final bit of swing out of this still newish ball. But he doesn\u2019t do himself any favours to begin here, the star of Australia\u2019s batting innings twice giving Pooran a chance to free his arms, the No4 twice flogging him over midwicket for boundaries. He\u2019s 18 from just 10 deliveries. \u201cWhat an interesting game so far!\u201d emails Damien McClean. \u201cI\u2019m watching with interest from a cold Melbourne. Great fight back from Australia, I was about ready to switch off after Maxwell\u2019s dismissal. I am an avid Maxwell fan; as I know you are, but like most of those you love they have a way of hurting you. I was desperate for him to have an impact, and at that point of the innings it was such a perfect opportunity. I suppose if we love it when he pulls it off we have to accept it when he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Well summed up. It did sting. But he\u2019ll be back. \u201cLooking forward to see how the Aussies defend this total now! Should be fascinating. Thanks for your work, and looking forward to your podcast recap tomorrow!\u201d Oh, you mean this? Thank you. We won\u2019t be short of material. 7th over: West Indies 41-2 (Hope 2, Pooran 10) Target 289 Very nice start from Pooran, driving Starc through cover with a nice high front elbow to get off the mark, racing away for four. He collects another boundary to the other side of the park, squeezing a full ball into the gap where the rope is only 60m from the bat. \u201cWhat figures are available for ODI records of a batsman\u2019s successful DRS reviews in a single over?\u201d asks John Starbuck. I know that CricViz keep that very stat. I\u2019m sure they will have it up on their social media feed soon. I\u2019ll keep an eye out. 6th over: West Indies 31-2 (Hope 2, Pooran 0) Target 289 Mikey Holding is not a happy man on the TV comms, believing that the ball to dismiss Gayle, while clipping the leg stump, was not hitting flush. \u201cDRS saves the umpire not the cricketer,\u201d he says. Cummins gets a chance at Hope, a man who knows all about playing a matchwinning innings in this country. The Australian quick is accurate with his short ball after attacking the stumps early in the over, but the Windies No3 is good enough to get under it. Cummins has the unusual analysis of 3-2-15-1. 5th over: West Indies 31-2 (Hope 2, Pooran 0) Target 289 Take a breath, yeah? Pooran is the new man, Starc hitting his bat with a straight, full ball to finish. \u201cAfternoon Adam,\u201d Hello Nick Parish.\u201d I\u2019m desperately supporting the Windies. Partly because, y\u2019know, we all want Australia to lose as a matter of course, don\u2019t we? But mainly because the only match I have tickets for is the last group game between the Aussies and the Saffers. If Australia wins this, it looks as though Australia could go into that match already through to the semi-finals, and South Africa already eliminated, which would be the very deadest of dead rubbers. Up the Windies!\u201d Don\u2019t be so sure. I reckon this is going to be an egalitarian scrap, the final four resolved on the final day with NRR determining all semi-finalists. But let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, I think we might have a classic on our hands. Gayle is gone! Starc has done the job for Australia, his delivery projected via DRS to be hitting enough of leg stump for the decision to be upheld. IS GAYLE LBW THIS TIME???? Once again he is given and reviews! Will Starc win this battle at last? Let\u2019s find out. 4th over: West Indies 27-1 (Gayle 19, Hope 1) Target 289 Boom! Boom! Boom! Three fours for Gayle in the Cummins over to put a nice early dent in this chase. Given the strike from Hope early in the over, the veteran middled a swat down the ground to begin, muscled the next one over Warner running back with the flight before pulling with authority to finish. 15 from the over. \u201cWe could be looking at one of the all time great games,\u201d writes Alan Synnott and I couldn\u2019t agree more. 3rd over: West Indies 12-1 (Gayle 5, Hope 0) Target 289 Boooooo roar the crowd as the players go back to their positions! I\u2019m not sure how the Australians can be blamed for going up for either of those but these aren\u2019t normal circumstances. Before the mayhem, I should note that Starc bowled a beauty at Gayle, spitting off a length and finding the outside edge, flying over the cordon for four. Oh, and he nearly spooned a catch to cover. The most eventful over of the World Cup so far! NOT OUT! Missing leg. By quite a long way, too! Umpire Gaffaney has had a shocker there. GAYLE IS GIVEN OUT LBW! He is reviewing again! IT IS ALL HAPPENING! We go through the process for the second time in three balls... NOT OUT! It is not an inside edge, the noise the ball looking to nick the off-stump on the way through, explaining the noise! But no bail movement. BLIMEY! IS GAYLE CAUGHT BEHIND? He\u2019s been given out by the umpire and decided to send it upstairs. Stand by. This is a huge moment. 2nd over: West Indies 7-1 (Gayle 1, Hope 0) Target 289 To think the strife that Australia were in a couple of hours ago. Now, they are probably one further early breakthrough away from a commanding position. The new man Hope gets a half volley on leg stump first up but picks out square leg. Oh, then the final ball keeps very low going under under his bat, no more than an inch away from off-stump. That\u2019s one benefit of bowling last on a pitch used twice in a week. That ends a wicket maiden to start for Cummins. Edged and taken at second slip. That\u2019s the perfect line and length angling across the left-hander. Cummins is in the book and Australia are away. 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (Gayle 1, Lewis 1) Target 289 In the very same way that the West Indies started with the ball this morning, they have been gifted five wides from Starc from the first delivery of their reply, the opening bowler spraying well down the legside and well beyond the \u2018keeper Carey. Gayle is off the mark from the first legal delivery to square leg with one, Lewis following suit with a glance a fraction finer, stopped well by Zampa who is sweeping on that rope. Starc\u2019s first short offering is well outside the off stump, left well alone as a result. Gayle defends the first ball on his stumps, the last one then nicely directed in the channel around fifth stump with Gayle shouldering arms again. 94mph says the radar. Sharp. Thanks, Sam. Smashing job. What an entertaining first innings that was. Australia would have surely taken 200-ish when they lost their fifth wicket. Instead, they have set West Indies a total that will be the biggest successfully chased in this tournament if they get up. As for Nathan Coulter-Nile, talk about repaying the faith. Right, the players are back on the field with Chris Gayle preparing to face the first ball from Mitch Starc, who is running towards me from the Pavilion End. Strap in. PLAY! West Indies rip through Australia\u2019s top order, Australia recover Hard to know where to start here - some wonderful individual performances on both sides, and some eyebrow-raisingly bad ones on both sides, too. A bouncer barrage was promised, and it was delivered. That said, it was a huge surprise to see the majority of Australia\u2019s top order succumb so meekly to it - each of Finch, Warner, Khawaja and Maxwell were worked over and dismissed in a manner that will jar coach Justin Langer. As they say, there is now a blueprint. Khawaja and Maxwell\u2019s dismissals will specifically grate. For Khawaja, the image of him backing away after two bouncers will not please the purists (or anyone), while Maxwell\u2019s decision to hook his second ball will sadly (and you\u2019d have to say, validly) reinforce a number of views about his temperament. For the West Indies, it was a ferocious period of bowling, that harked back to the days of old - Fire In Babylon and all that. OShane Thomas, Sheldon Cottrell and Andre Russell tore the batsmen asunder, and left Australia teetering at 79-5. Steve Smith, however, looked assured throughout, and held it together, which is what he does. Alex Carey was bright in his 45, and he was followed by Nathan Coulter-Nile who may well have tipped this back in Australia\u2019s favour with an exhibition of power hitting that lifted him and Australia to a height not earlier foreseen. In Coulter-Nile\u2019s case, his 92 from 60 deliveries is the highest score made at a World Cup from a batsman listed from 8 to 11 - just underscoring the scale of the innings. While this was happening, Sheldon Cottrell was able to snaffle one of the game\u2019s greatest ever catches, running to his left and ensnaring Steve Smith\u2019s bullet-like whip over square leg, that was comfortably going for six, and possibly taking somebody\u2019s head off. You will see highlights of this for years. Was it better than Stokes\u2019 catch? Do we have to compare? It was absolutely brilliant: 10/10. Catch aside, there\u2019s no doubt the West Indies\u2019 fielding fell apart, as did their bowling. Whether or not they chase down this total, that will be a talking point for them - as will Andre Russell\u2019s fitness - as he was forced to leave the ground on multiple occasions to tend to his knee. After the innings, Coulter-Nile said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of wicket where you have to take your time, and get used to the bounce. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the wicket, or them ... but it definitely took time to get used to it.\u201d Is 288 a good score? In the context of 79-5, it most definitely is. The Windies will have to bat well to get there, but whether Australia can effect the same devastation with the short ball remains to be seen. You can stick around for that with Adam Collins, who joins next. A big thanks to all who\u2019ve joined me around the world. The emails and messages were sensational - even the multitude of grammatical corrections. Sorry to those I didn\u2019t get to - this was a very hurried affair. Catch you next time. Starc now caught at long-on, so another one for Brathwaite. An incredible recovery from Australia. Will follow with some end of innings thoughts. He falls short! Coulter-Nile holes out at long off, caught by Jason Holder. It was an excellent, excellent knock from the West Aussie. He\u2019s changed the entire rhythm of the match with his clean hitting. Comfortably the most notable contribution he\u2019s made to the national side. 48th over: Australia 282-8 (Starc 4, Coulter-Nile 90) Coulter-Nile misses out on the first two balls from Thomas here, and can only get himself a single following a top yorker. Agreat first half of the over from the young quick. He gets a look at Starc, and gets another dot. Starc finds two doubles to finish, but it\u2019s an altogether good over from Thomas, all things considering. His spell comes to an end - what an enigmatic package it was. He finishes with 2/63 from 10. He started the early rot. Interesting from John Catchlove here: \u201cThe WI aren\u2019t fit enough. Play too much 20/20. Russell couldn\u2019t bowl 8 overs. After 30 overs they fell apart. Wides, bad fielding, bowling all over the shop. One spectacular catch won\u2019t stop the rot. They won\u2019t make the finals. John Catchlove Melbourne Aus\u201d Hard to disagree after the back half of this innings. 47th over: Australia 268-8 (Starc 0, Coulter-Nile 89) An extraordinary innings from Coulter-Nile here. Following Cummins\u2019 dismissal, Coulter-Nile goes four (lofted cover drive, four (pull shot), then single, bringing Starc on strike. He sees out the over. 18 balls remain... While we\u2019re talking about destructive innings\u2019, check this piece on news of AB De Villiers\u2019 proposal to play for SA this World Cup, 24 hours before the team selection. Cottrell is in the game! This time Cummins skies a shorter slower ball to deep backward square, and Cottrell takes a comparatively simpler catch. It leaves Coulter-Nile on strike. Starc is the next batsman. 46th over: Australia 268-7 (Cummins 2, Coulter-Nile 80) More Gayle jester-ism. He falls to his right to stop one at short fine leg, and prevents a boundary to be fair. Soon after, Coulter-Nile hammers a boundary, and then cleanly hits a pull shot that ... checking ... hits the rope on the full and is six. It actually hits Brathwaite\u2019s hand, and the ricochet changes the trajectory sufficiently to help it onto the rope. Win some, lose some. It\u2019s technically a dropped catch, but Brathwaite was never in with a shot. Next ball, Coulter-Nile smashes Cottrell over mid-on for another six! He\u2019s on 80 - the highest score for a number 8 at the World Cup, commentators tell us. Can he go all the way? Cummins gets a single from the last ball. Sixteen from the over. Some fightback, this. 45th over: Australia 252-7 (Cummins 0, Coulter-Nile 66) Here we go. Smith lofts Thomas over mid-off (why is he up?) for four to kick things off. And then. And then. A ripsnorter of a take from Cottrell on the rope. Cottrell v Stokes. Stokes v Cottrell. It\u2019s worth of comparison. I\u2019ll leave it with you guys. It came at him fiercely. Smith got every piece of it. It will be a global highlight transcending cricket news. Anyway, a few wides follow and Cummins sees out the over. Seven from it. Five overs remain. What. A. Catch! Smith whips Thomas from middle stump flat and it\u2019s going for six. Cottrell moves to his left, outstretches his left hand and it sticks! But the work\u2019s not done. Momentum is taking him over the boundary. In a nanosecond he\u2019s flicked the ball in the air, leaves the field of play, gets back in and takes the catch. It arrives to him faster than Stokes\u2019 did, he moves laterally, deals with the boundary rope, and ends the innings of Australia\u2019s senior batsman. Could be huge in the scheme of things. What a catch. 44th over: Australia 245-6 (Smith 69, Coulter-Nile 65) Coulter-Nile executes a delicate little lap from Nurse\u2019s bowling for a boundary from the first ball. There\u2019s the requisite wide for the over, before Coulter-Nile is dropped at deep midwicket! He rocked onto the back foot at hit it hard. Hetmyer stormed in, overran it, and it and split it. There\u2019s then a single, a two to extra cover, another single, a wide, and a single to finish. Twelve from it. They surely can\u2019t get 300 after being 38-4? 43rd over: Australia 233-6 (Smith 67, Coulter-Nile 57) And now Australia gets moving. First, Smith throws his bat at one and gets a lucky slice fine of third man for four, before a single brings Coulter-Nile on strike and he unleashes. A skied two brings up his fifty, before he launches a huge six over long on and into the crowd. It\u2019s a full toss, and it looks like the Windies are dipping rapidly. 42nd over: Australia 218-6 (Smith 62, Coulter-Nile 48) Nurse getting through his over at great pace as the West Indies are behind their over rate, and finds himself more economical than his team-mates. Meanwhile, Coulter-Nile closes in on a maiden international fifty. 41st over: Australia 214-6 (Smith 60, Coulter-Nile 46) Coulter-Nile gets another in the arc early this over, and lifts Brathwaite for a boundary. This has been an extremely valuable innings, and probably underscores why he bats above Cummins. It\u2019s singles otherwise, and eight off the over. Junior on \u2018the front stool\u2019, as they say. 40th over: Australia 206-6 (Smith 58, Coulter-Nile 40) Ashley Nurse takes up the reigns; concedes only four. At one point Chris Gayle chases a ball - the crowd erupts. He extravagantly doffs his cap. Says a bit that this over felt like the Windies stemming the tide, rather than searching for a seventh. Although the partnership is now sixty, I think they need to keep searching. Andre Russell has left the field His knee does not look great. Hope he\u2019s okay. 39th over: Australia 202-6 (Smith 56, Coulter-Nile 38) It\u2019s Russell again, he must really want Coulter-Nile\u2019s wicket. He is declining in penetration, and now mixes his bumpers with slower balls. Just as Michael Holding scolds his compatriots for failing to place two men correctly behind square, Coulter-Nile then lifts Russell for six in drop-kick fashion. The ball cannons into a poor guy\u2019s lunch too. That\u2019s not a euphemism - his lunch went everywhere. It\u2019s the fifty partnership for these two, of which Coulter-Nile\u2019s hit 38! Sixty balls remain in the innings - how many can Australia glean from it? 38th over: Australia 195-6 (Smith 56, Coulter-Nile 30) Signs of this drifting for the Windies, some sloppiness creeping into the fielding as point and cover leave it to eachother to claim a ball, allowing Smith to gather two. Cottrell concedes yet another wide later in the over, and in between there\u2019s three singles. Six from the over. 37th over: Australia 189-6 (Smith 53, Coulter-Nile 29) If Australia continues at the same rate, they make 255, which would be a commendable effort after being 38-4 and 79-5. Here Coulter-Nile takes seven from Russell\u2019s over after Smith took his single, punctuated by another top-edged hook for four that pierces deep backward square and long leg. 36th over: Australia 181-6 (Smith 52, Coulter-Nile 22) Two singles bookend this over, but in the middle there\u2019s a boundary for Smith (an edge from the toe of a huge slash outside off), and it brings up Smith\u2019s fifty. He\u2019s the only guy who\u2019s looked consistently capable of handling the short barrage, and though it\u2019s taken 77 balls, it\u2019s been critical to keeping this innings together. Of course, there\u2019s boos. This from Phil Withall: \u201cEvening Sam, As nice as it is to see the Australian batsman struggle, and it is very nice indeed, there is always the nagging realization that the Australian bowlers are more than capable of destroying any batting lineup put before them. It\u2019s a little bit like sharing a chocolate bar knowing that the last piece is someone else\u2019s. Satisfying yet ultimately disappointing. Cheers\u201d It\u2019s interesting. I wonder if they have the same ability to bowl that consistently menacing shorter length. While they match and may occasionally outstrip the Windies for pace, there\u2019s something a little more conventional about their method. 35th over: Australia 175-6 (Smith 47, Coulter-Nile 21) The short stuff continues to Coulter-Nile, and he rides his luck. It\u2019s Russell who continues (I worry for his body), and Coulter-Nile is able to top edge a hook for four. Then there\u2019s two more wides, before Coulter-Nile takes Russell over mid-wicket, where the shot achieves more height than length, but lands safely at deep wicket. Two from that. A yorker follows, which Coulter-Nile digs out. This is great cricket, I have to say. A single to finish. Commentators make the point that Coulter-Nile doesn\u2019t look in full control, and that \u201csomething will happen soon.\u201d I\u2019d agree, but how many more overs can Russell manage? Another note from our friend, Robert Wilson. \u201cI\u2019m losing my mind here. It\u2019s very worrying. They\u2019re just immense, this team. crawling out from under the weight of that cricketing legacy is an incredible effort. Doing it while being likeable, is something else entirely. If they were on Free-to-Air TV, cricket would abound in over-excited ten year olds and would thus be healthy for decades.\u201d Quite. 34th over: Australia 166-6 (Smith 47, Coulter-Nile 14) Thomas looks likely, but he concedes plenty, too. Twelve from this one. Thomas zeroes one in at the stumps early and Coulter-Nile squeezes him for four down the ground. There\u2019s a two, a wide, and then a half-volley on leg stump is lifted by the West Australian behind square for another boundary. There\u2019s a single to finish. 33rd over: Australia 153-6 (Smith 46, Coulter-Nile 3) Michael Clarke tells us that Coulter-Nile and Russell know each other well from Kolkata\u2019s IPL unit - though who that benefits, I\u2019m not sure. Coulter-Nile drives hard but can\u2019t beat mid-off; still, he gets off strike. Smith, after being hit on the hand, is now waiting back for that short one and misses a drive as a result. Russell - what a fantastic cricketer he is. As I type that, he drops short and Smith punches through the off-side for three, so will face up next over. Four from this one. 32nd over: Australia 149-6 (Smith 43, Coulter-Nile 2) Great change from Holder, OShane Thomas straight back into the attack. Coulter-Nile looks ill-equipped for Thomas\u2019s pace - real tail-ender stuff, at least at this stage. There are four men square in the ring waiting for one to pop up. A full ball then tails in and Coulter-Nile somehow gets bat on it and gets off strike. But then Smith is not immune! A ball kicks up off the surface and wraps him on the hand very hard - looks like his finger might be in trouble. Physio\u2019s out on the ground. 31st over: Australia 148-6 (Smith 43, Coulter-Nile 1) Dre Russ is back, and the body looks extremely creaky to start with. But of course, he provides the X-factor and knocks over Carey, bringing Coulter-Nile to the crease. Coulter-Nile leaves the first one and how has it missed!? Dre Russ wheels away in agony. The next one is quick and Coulter-Nile is about a quarter of the way through his pull shot when it hits the splice. It pops up but neither Hope nor the man at backward square leg can get there in time. Put it away man! Dre Russ gets the breakthrough! Carey\u2019s caught on the crease as a fuller ball tails away; it takes the edge and Carey has to go. Important innings from Carey, but a sense he missed out on something significant. 30th over: Australia 146-5 (Smith 42, Carey 45) Nurse continues around the wicket to the right-handed Smith. He\u2019s wearing Mark Waugh Oakley/Bolle glasses while he bowls, too. He drops short a few times early but both Smith and Carey fail to put him away. They keep ticking it over, three from that over. Drinks. 29th over: Australia 143-5 (Smith 40, Carey 44) Brathwaite is back, and concedes six. As he warms up, he starts banging them halfway down the wicket. It bothers neither batsman. The Aussies are growing in confidence here. I\u2019ve been waiting for a quieter over to post this wonderful email from Robert Wilson (thanks Robert). Here it is: \u201cDear Sam, I love Australia like you should love puppies or children but the West Indies are the bright, clear dawn of all cricket love. Of course, they may not win this match but, notwithstanding, I\u2019m getting slightly worried about how happy and rejuvenated this is making me. All euphoria is intrinsically hazardous. Especially that which makes you feel like a teenager and start humming Wham! songs and shouting random anti-Thatcher slogans in your sleepy Parisian neighbourhood. Nothing could come close to the embarrassing and age-inappropriate awe I feel for Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards but Jason Holder is, at the very least, making me check the placings. He\u2019s the best captain in world cricket by whatever a country mile actually is. Robert Wilson PS, Would you like to hear my courageous and inspiring a capella version of Kajagoogoo\u2019s \u2018Too Shy\u2019?\u201d Will not sully this prose with my own comments. Thanks again. 28th over: Australia 137-5 (Smith 39, Carey 39) Ashley Nurse\u2019s offspin is introduced, and Smith attempts to hit the cover off his first ball through cover. He succeeds only in French cutting the new bowler, the ball missing the stumps narrowly. Carey then bravely reverse-sweeps Nurse for four - the first ball he faced from him. A few singles finish things off. Carey has raced to parity with Smith, both on 39. Can Australia keep this going for another ten overs? 27th over: Australia 129-5 (Smith 37, Carey 33) Seven from this over, headlined by another cracking cover drive from Carey. Smith missed out on a boundary with an off drive earlier on (but found a run), while Carey tucks one around the corner for two to finish. Brian Withington with a solid suggestion: \u201cHi Sam, Lovely to see a bit of statistical precision entering the OBO with your 19th over assessment of Steve Smith\u2019s relative comfort level measured at \u2018four standard deviations\u2019. Can I volunteer that we introduce the \u2018confidence interval of uncertainty\u2019 as another measure of batting prowess (outside off-stump)? I\u2019m not sure what it means yet but I like it\u2019s aura of spurious precision. DRS decisions are of course a natural application of hypothesis testing, and I suspect Bayes would have had a field day with the a priori umpire\u2019s soft call.\u201d I have suspected so, too. *Looks up Bayes immediately* 26th over: Australia 122-5 (Smith 36, Carey 27) Cottrell continues, and it\u2019s one, dot, one, dot, one, dot. Australia steadying slightly, but far more work to do. Andy Tyacke with something relevant: \u201cSince, as I type, wides are the fourth highest score for Australia today, should they not be rewarded with their own run rate on this occasion? Seriously: I can\u2019t believe that bowlers at this level are gifting so many unnecessary runs - even against as suicidal a gang as Australia on this day! Andy Tyacke Bockhorst Germany\u201d 18 extras, 15 wides today. The bouncer tactic will leave a team open to more wides - but not that many. Great point. 25th over: Australia 119-5 (Smith 34, Carey 26) Missed chance! Holder changes ends and aims straight to Smith\u2019s helmet. Smith hooks and immediately lets out a pessimistic groan. Cottrell comes around but takes a poor angle, and eventually slips. The ball bounces in front of him, then over him, rolling into the rope. If he judges it correctly, it\u2019s a definite chance. Smith then whips Holder through midwicket for three next ball, before Carey steals another single later on. Their running is excellent. 24th over: Australia 110-5 (Smith 26, Carey 25) Carey counterpunches. Cottrell comes back into the attack and Carey goes dot, four, four, single. The two boundaries were back foot slashes through the offside, hit hard. He then follows with the obligatory quick single, which typically elicits cries of \u201cgood batting.\u201d This time M Slater did the job on comms. Smith then gets Carey back on strike before Carey finishes the over by gracefully depositing a wide half-volley through cover for four. Must be the first time in the match Australia has \u2018won\u2019 two overs in a row. 24 from the last two overs. 23rd over: Australia 96-5 (Smith 25, Carey 12) More sternum material for Carey, this time from lynchpin OShane Thomas. This time, an Australian batsman succeeds. He leans back glides one over third slip for a boundary, and then crunches a fuller delivery past mid off for four. Smith then pinches a single running to the danger end to finish the over. Ten from the over. 22nd over: Australia 86-5 (Smith 24, Carey 3) The squeeze is on now; a maiden from Holder. Most balls would have been rising past his chest. Carey is 3 from 25 balls. Of course, you can always catch up. Geoff Wignall with a point: \u201cHi Sam, unfortunately the Windies could be creating a problem for themselves if current trends continue - unless they get to bat first, their batsmen are going to have scant opportunity to find any kind of form. Nice to see them back though.\u201d Nice. 21st over: Australia 86-5 (Smith 24, Carey 3) Another run for Carey before Smith gets Katich-esque, crabbing across, and rocketing an overpitched ball on middle stump to the man at deep square. Carey then hits uppishly over point, gaining one to third man. 20th over: Australia 83-5 (Smith 23, Carey 1) Another quiet over, while Carey works his way into his innings. There\u2019s a Bronx cheer for him as he gets off the mark - he\u2019d faced fifteen balls. Smith saw out the last. An email from Tom Adam: \u201cDoes that review count as a rush of blood to the head? They could regret that when Smith\u2019s plumb on 150!\u201d Ha, it wasn\u2019t too far away, I thought. 19th over: Australia 82-5 (Smith 23, Carey 0) So Oshane Thomas comes back into the attack. He started the damage, and still looks likely in his second spell. Still he has to get past Smith, who has looked more comfortable than his compatriots by about four standard deviations. Thomas concedes a few wides, and Smith gets through. 18th over: Australia 80-5 (Smith 23, Carey 0) Smith starts with a single down the ground, before Brathwaite causes Carey some trouble...wait for it...on the front foot. Can you believe it? Carey is half-forward and survives an LBW appeal, before a similar ball grabs an inside edge, whereupon the ball pops up - falling just short of Brathwaite. He otherwise survives - cue firmly in rack. NOT OUT Well, it was in line, but travelling over the top. Carey survives, the West Indies lose a review. REVIEW An LBW call against Carey. Given not out, the West Indies review. Carey coming forward. First thought was it hit him outside the line... 17th over: Australia 79-5 (Smith 22, Carey 0) Right, another gone, and now Carey joins. A wicket-maiden for Holder. We surely won\u2019t see a rush of blood for the next fifteen overs, at least. S-surely? Well! Stoinis tries to heave Holder over mid wicket, but instead hits it straight to him. Another error from one dug in. It hits the splice, and balloons to Pooran. He was looking okay, but now joins the highlight reel. 16th over: Australia 79-4 (Smith 22, Stoinis 19) More Smith time, and while the 129km/hr offerings don\u2019t rattle Smith, he does bop and weave once or twice to deliveries that just jump or nip back in. But the former Australian captain has the last laugh (of the over), back foot punching Brathwaite through cover for four. Important to note that Andre Russell has left the field, and not returned for some time. Big miss if he\u2019s unable to make it back. 15th over: Australia 75-4 (Smith 18, Stoinis 19) Smith takes the majority of Holder\u2019s over, is subject to the short stuff again, and comfortably works to leg when needed. 14th over: Australia 72-4 (Smith 16, Stoinis 18) Steadier from Brathwaite. Continues the shorter length and straight lines, and both Smith and Stoinis are happy to work to leg for three singles. Throw a wide in there (there\u2019s been a good number), and there\u2019s four from the over. More contributions. This one from OB Jato: \u201cFirst Pakistan, now Australia. This is too much Dark Horse-ry from West Indians to go unnoticed any longer... Most underestimated pace attack of the tournament?\u201d Good point. If they were underestimated, they won\u2019t be any more! That\u2019s drinks. Wow, we can breathe. 13th over: Australia 68-4 (Smith 14, Stoinis 17) Jason Holder\u2019s into the attack, and while he too is a little slower than his colleagues, he bowls from about 9 feet, so bounce will be a factor. Even so, Stoinis executes two of the most sumptuous drives down the ground for boundaries - the second especially graceful. Dave Adams with an email (g\u2019day Dave). \u201cMorning Sam, Just checked in on the score. Nearly laughed myself sick. Is there a more enjoyable sight in cricket than Australian failure? Cheers\u201d I can see how that would be the case! 12th over: Australia 60-4 (Smith 14, Stoinis 9) Brathwaite is gentler, and both batsmen look eminently more comfortable. Both pick up singles before Smith cuts hard through point for four, So many emails - they\u2019re all great. David writes: \u201cHi Sam, I\u2019m sure you have millions of gloating English and unhappy fellow counterpersons sending you messages but why if Maxwell thrashes for six on considering we\u2019re three down gets no mention of \u201cthat shot\u201d and poor old Khawaja \u201cwill get dropped\u201d? Well, I think Khawaja will get dropped, and Maxwell probably won\u2019t. Take your point that Maxwell is equally culpable, but his dismissal didn\u2019t expose weakness as thoroughly as Khawaja\u2019s did. And the manner of Khawaja\u2019s response to that issue is probably not befitting of a top order Australian batsman, in my view. 11th over: Australia 54-4 (Smith 9, Stoinis 8) Russell is attempting bouncers and yorkers. It\u2019s extremely fun. He\u2019s off line on ball one and Smith punches his full toss down the ground for four. It takes Australia past fifty (waheey). A single brings Stoinis on strike. He\u2019s bumped immediately - though it\u2019s a wide. The second is also short and Stoinis is hopping - always a good sign for the bowler. The last sees Stoinis jumping and ... backing away? Incredible to see these techniques exposed at this level. Good on the West Indies. While we\u2019re talking about the West Indies in the UK, a bump for this piece ahead of the Womens\u2019 series between England and the Carribean outfit. 10th over: Australia 48-4 (Smith 4, Stoinis 8) Carlos Brathwaite\u2019s introduced, and his short stuff at 80mph has slightly less effect. Stoinis is able to crunch a full toss down the ground for four, before hooking another - with control - behind square for four. 9th over: Australia 40-4 (Smith 4, Stoinis 0) Russell to Smith. No problem. Here\u2019s Smith\u2019s technique to the short stuff: back and across. Duck. Weave. Work to leg. Get inside the line. Leave for a wide. He fails to flick the fifth ball full toss for four, but otherwise sees out the over - as he needed to. 8th over: Australia 38-4 (Smith 4, Stoinis 0) Cottrell\u2019s on fire. He grabs Maxwell, then hurries up Stoinis before finishing by beating him all ends up. Doubt Stoinis will have faced a situation like this - we\u2019ll find out about him here. Smith, as ever, looks like he can manage it. You can feel the national conniption here. The salute is fantastic, too. Another short ball, another wicket! Maxwell, on his second ball, with his team three down after seven overs, tries to pull Cottrell for six. He skies it straight in the air to Hope.Australia are in all sorts. We are learning that they are technically deficient against this bowling. 7th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 3, Maxwell 0) Andre Russell\u2019s introduced - OShane Thomas has left the field. He gets five balls at Khawaja, who remains jumpy on the back foot. he slashes and misses the next, before executing a duck-pull that screams past leg gully (who\u2019s in a helmet). Khawaja gets hit again, missing a pull shot. And then, he backs away, slashes hard and nicks behind. There will be lots said about that shot. Unfortunately for Khawaja, it will be remembered. Khawaja gives himself room/backs away, and tries to mow Russell over mid-off, but nicks it and Hope takes a wonderful sprawling catch to his left. It followed a peppering of bouncers from Russell. I think we can say quite comfortably that Khawaja will be dropped after this. He was incredibly found out here. 6th over: Australia 33-2 (Smith 2, Khawaja 11) Smith looks most comfortable against this pace, unsurprisingly. He\u2019s back and across on most occasions, and able to work the quicks to leg. That said, there\u2019s only one from the over, as both batsmen attempt to get their bearings. 5th over: Australia 32-2 (Smith 1, Khawaja 11) Khawaja sees out a few dots before a Hope fumble behind the stumps enables a bye. Smith tucks one to deep square and is stopped from gaining two via great fielding from Cottrell. Khawaja looks unsettled against the bouncer on ball five, before paddling the next for four, against the backdrop of \u201ccatch it!\u201d cries to the man at leg slip. 4th over: Australia 26-2 (Smith 0, Khawaja 7) It was a quiet over before Cottrell struck. He maintained a tight-enough line to concede only singles, letting himself down with a high wide on ball six. But the wide paved the way for Warner\u2019s demise. Australia\u2019s batsmen look like Wallabies in the headlights here. Thanks to all writing in to me, too. I\u2019ll get to it - this fast start has me scurrying. Caught! Warner slashes at one that is not at all there to slash, and scoops it from the splice to backward point, where Hetmeyer takes an easy catch. The salute follows, the boo\u2019s for Warner ensue, and they continue for Steve Smith. There\u2019s something in the air here - Australia are in trouble. 3rd over: Australia 22-1 (Warner 2, Khawaja 5) Thomas does Finch all ends up, bringing Usman Khawaja to the crease. There\u2019s a super aggressive field for him. Of course, he got knocked down in the Windies\u2019 practice match - and now finds himself dealing with shoulder-level bowling and a leg slip. No mid-on allows Khawaja to push one through the vacant region for four. Two balls later and Khawaja is hit - a nasty ball that slams into his helmet - with a bit of glove beforehand. The Doctor comes out to see if he\u2019s okay - he\u2019s smiling, and looks fine. The next one is full, Khawaja is equal to it, and runs it down to third man. Great over from Thomas. Beautiful delivery! Thomas has Finch pegged on his crease, and nabs a classic fast-bowler\u2019s wicket: on a great length, with great bounce, just nibbling away. He grabs Finch\u2019s edge and Hope does the rest. Helter-skelter start here. 2nd over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 2, Finch 6) It\u2019s Cottrell from the other end; Finch flicks his first ball firmly and uppishly to deep square. It bounces once to the man out there. Incidentally, Michael Clarke is on ICC comms here - he\u2019s speaking at five words a second and is clearly overexcited. Will need Ian Bishop\u2019s voice to calm him (in the way it calms me). Later, Cottrell delivers a waist-high full toss - it\u2019s on Finch quickly but he squeezes it behind backward point for two. The next one\u2019s at Finch\u2019s chest and he rolls his wrists on it easily for one. No short stuff yet! Still looking for swing. 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 2, Finch 2) OShane Thomas takes the first ball, as that stiff breeze blows through his maroon guernsey. He starts with a rank, full, leg side wide, that evades Shai Hope and rolls away for four. Five from the first ball. A few singles follow and then Thomas hits Warner dead in front, but it\u2019s a no-ball! Replays show Warner gained an inside-edge, and the ensuing free-hit is slapped toward airily toward mid on, where it\u2019s \u2018dropped\u2019, and Warner gets one. Finch grabs a single to finish. Think Thomas hit about seven different lengths there; possibly a little nervous A little bit of cloud overhead, and some wind Kerry O\u2019Keeffe suggests that wind negates swing, and I suppose bluster will do that. On the other hand, a smooth breeze like the Fremantle Doctor aids swing immensely. Either way, this Kookaburra Duke apparently swings for about three balls before deferring to something closer to gun-barrell. Also, just registered the first boo for Warner. Anthems now Have always wondered if it was fractionally disappointing for those opening batsmen, who join their compatriots arm in arm for the anthem, with pads. We briefly hear Australia\u2019s team singing it. It\u2019s in an octave lower than necessary, out of tune, and I think Zampa is trying to make Stoinis laugh. Nothing new there. Warner and Finch v a five-pronged pace attack I can feel the energy surging through Brendon Julian, Andrew Symonds and Kerry O\u2019Keeffe on Australia\u2019s Fox Sports coverage, as they discuss the Windies\u2019 quintet of speedsters. Kerry reserves specific praise for O\u2019Shane Thomas - a kid from a tough part of Kingston, who Chris Gayle identified and brought through the system. In the Australian lingo, he bowls \u201c145 plus\u201d and can be deadly on his day. Just on O\u2019Keeffe, if it\u2019s not already apparent, he really does leave his colleagues for dead in terms of his preparation and knowledge. When you get past the colour and schmaltz of that particular production, his analysis is extremely sharp. Teams - West Indies West Indies Playing XI: Chris Gayle, Evin Lewis, Shai Hope(w), Nicholas Pooran, Shimron Hetmyer, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Ashley Nurse, Sheldon Cottrell, Oshane Thomas Teams - Australia Australia is unchanged. Australia Playing XI: Aaron Finch(c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey(w), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa West Indies have won the toss, and will field Holder calls correctly, and says he thinks there might be a \u201clittle bit in it early,\u201d and that it should become flatter as the day goes on. Finch says \u201cI probably would have had a bat first anyway,\u201d citing pitch dryness. Zampa will come into play massively as a result. Interesting that Finch wanted to bat anyway - classic Australia. Lots of talk 340-350 is in sight today Small boundaries, third/fourth day pitch, sunny skies. Does Australia have the power to get there? Great test for them today. Sunny-ish... Holder says Gayle and Russell will be good to go... Both looked in some pain v Pakistan. This from Cricket Australia\u2019s official page, earlier today (AEST): \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few days off, they\u2019ve been recovering quite nicely,\u201d Holder told reporters. \u201cWe expect both of them to hopefully be fit and ready to go tomorrow. We\u2019ve still got some time to go, so we\u2019ll make a final call in the morning. \u201cThe beauty about both of those guys is they\u2019ve both played enough cricket. We just tend to trust them, take their word and make a final determination.\u201d Amazing to think Gayle is almost 40. An email... From friend of the show, Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cBatman and Maxwell are both caped crusaders,\u201d says Abhijato, \u201cwho go to any lengths to help their people; they\u2019re constantly under scrutiny despite all of their achievements; they defy odds as well as laws of physics every time; finally, both their stories are a source of inspiration and belief in oneself. Cheers Maxi! Him being in-form, there\u2019s a strong chance we\u2019ll see heroics from him throughout this tournament.\u201d Another Maxwell devotee, I see! Would be fantastic to see a big innings from him today. Not sure I can remember a build-up so solely focused on the explosive elements of both sides. Will be very interesting to see how Australia\u2019s middle over bowlers cope with a flat Trent Bridge pitch and short boundaries. If Gayle and co come out the other side Cummins and Starc\u2019s opening spell, there will be a real test for Zampa and Stoinis especially. Still, bouncers to Gayle will be good viewing. Here\u2019s Brian Lara and Dean Jones shadow boxing Normal stuff. Again, the muscular motif. Earnest team news coming soon. Toss around 15 minutes away too. Sunny conditions in Nottingham, too So no rain, though rain is forecast for the remainder of the week. Loving the entire muscular motif to this... There\u2019s almost zero doubt this match will be settled by a spinner, or a neat catch, or precision batting. Welcome to an old-fashioned Alpha Showdown! (not really) \u201cObviously no one likes a ball 140-145kph at your head.\u201d Brathwaite, C. Hello everyone, and cheers for joining our coverage of the bouncer summit, aka the ICC World Cup fixture between Australia and the West Indies, from Trent Bridge, Nottingham. I kid (do I?), but the 10th fixture of this World Cup has largely been billed as the Bouncer Battle, as two cocks of the short-bowling walk face off to decide who will become the second team to two wins, after New Zealand scraped home against Bangladesh yesterday. Taking a step back from benign bumper talk; it\u2019s been fantastic to see the West Indies roar back into form of late \u2013 their Test series win against England and manhandling of Pakistan providing another glimpse of the revival everyone in world cricket wants to see. They meet an Australian side on an impressive winning streak, though how meaningful that streak is will be determined in the next few days. They now play four fixtures in ten days, the result of which will provide a far clearer indication of where they\u2019re at in ODI cricket terms. There\u2019s a distinct feeling that today will provide the first real insight into the true form of both units. While there\u2019s no do-or-die element to it at all, both sides bring credible designs on winning. Legacy would suggest Australia retains the stronger reason to expect victory, but there are enough question marks within the canary-wearing outfit to suggest it\u2019s not a foregone thing. The Windies will test that out today, no doubt. All up, it all points to a pretty mouthwatering fixture. Would love your views, insights, love letters, grammar corrections etc, so if that takes your fancy I\u2019m at sam.perry.freelance@theguardian.com, and @sjjperry on the Twitter Bazaar. Will have team + toss news for you shortly.
