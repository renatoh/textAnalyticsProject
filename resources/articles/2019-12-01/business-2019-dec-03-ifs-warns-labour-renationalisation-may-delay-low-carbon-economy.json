The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that taking water, energy companies, the Royal Mail and railways under state control would be costly, complex and risky and said Labour might do better to tighten regulation instead. Lucy Kraftman, an IFS research economist, said: \u201cThe industries that Labour plan to nationalise are vital to the UK economy. The key question is whether they would be better managed in the public sector, and what nationalisation can achieve that changing the current regulatory frameworks cannot. \u201cAt least in the short run Labour\u2019s current plan would lead to significant disruption which could easily, for example, lead to a hiatus in progress towards decarbonisation in the energy sector. One should have very clear evidence for the long term benefits before embarking on such a complex and costly set of changes.\u201d The shadow chancellor John McDonnell flatly rejected the IFS argument. \u201cLabour\u2019s proposals for nationalisation will enable us to speed up the transition to a sustainable economy and enable us to meet our decarbonisation targets all the sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cArguing for sticking to a regulation approach, after years of its failure, is a nakedly ideological stance and one at odds with all the evidence.\u201d Labour has outlined four key reasons for its renationalisation plan: lower prices, higher investment, better services to customers and higher pay. The IFS said the change of ownership would bring around \u00a3200bn of assets and \u00a3150bn of debt onto the public sector balance sheet. In addition, Labour would have to provide compensation to the current owners at an appropriate market price, likely to be \u201cmany tens of billions of pounds, at the least\u201d. In a background briefing, the thinktank said: \u201cTo pay more would represent bad value for money for the taxpayer. To pay less would amount to an expropriation of private property, which would leave current owners (including pension funds) out of pocket. Many of the privately held companies are foreign-owned. Paying less than their full market value would risk harming the UK\u2019s reputation and standing with other countries.\u201d The IFS said the industries on Labour\u2019s renationalisation list were important for the operation of the UK economy. \u201cGiven their importance, and the enormous cost, complexity and risk involved in bringing them into public ownership, the key question must be what is it that can be so much more readily achieved through a transfer of ownership that cannot be achieved through altering the current regulatory framework,\u201d it said. The energy industry supported the IFS argument that renationalisation could delay decarbonisaton. The Energy Networks Association (ENA) said Britain\u2019s privately owned network operators are well positioned to help cut emissions to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050, but state ownership proposals would \u201clikely to lead to delays to decarbonisation, reduced public accountability, disruption to innovation and higher costs to billpayers\u201d. Renewable UK, which represents the companies developing Britain\u2019s biggest clean energy projects, echoed the ENA\u2019s warning. It said reorganising the UK\u2019s energy networks \u201crisks being a costly and complex option at a time when we need to speed up the decarbonisation of our economy\u201d. \u201cTime to reach net zero is running out,\u201d the ENA added. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste it by needlessly scrapping a system that works.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
