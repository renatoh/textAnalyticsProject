If you, too, find Patrick Mouratoglou\u2019s verbose, foot-stampy turn of phrase obscurely endearing, you may be willing to indulge the idea that tennis players\u2019 post-match displays of affection can also be adjudicated. By him. Mouratoglou went on to clarify that he was not attacking anyone in particular. \u201cSometimes it makes sense to do it,\u201d he said, referencing Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka, who, friends for many years, embraced fondly at the end of their quarter-final stand-off at the French Open on Tuesday, \u201cbut it starts to be systematic\u201d. Mouratoglou was making a generalised criticism of a sporting culture that has turned saccharine: over-rewarding love, over-criticising resentment. You can see why he might: Williams is policed very closely for her \u201cmood\u201d. I thought, at the start of her career in the 90s, people were projecting their feelings on to her, because otherwise there was so little to say: \u201cShe\u2019s won. Oh look, she\u2019s won again.\u201d But in hindsight, and because it hasn\u2019t got better over time, I realise that this is plain racism, every twitch of her eyebrow filtered through the prism of the \u201cangry black woman\u201d trope (is she predictably angry? Masking her anger? Too angry, or not angry enough?). People who may be using tennis and its on-court etiquette as a way to police women. But setting aside the politics of passion, maybe it is time to bring a bit of John McEnroe\u2019s authenticity back to the game. \u201cI can\u2019t advocate people not liking each other. But \u2026 I\u2019d prefer it,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cIt was fun when guys were trash-talking each other and yelling at each other.\u201d Though McEnroe did often seem like a bit of a baby, there is value to showing the world your true face. It is genuinely moving to watch one person hug another when there is love to it, especially with and, even better, a backstory (witness the Champions\u2019 League final). But a loveless hug that you suspect to be for brand-building purposes is horribly off-putting. Then you feel bad for thinking that \u2013 who are you to stand in the way of a new generation, who seem to be constantly burying each other in bear hugs, as if recently rescued from the ocean? \u2013 so you sourly give it the benefit of the doubt. I agree with Mouratoglou: we need to be much more exacting about this. Anyone who wants to hug has to provide photographic evidence of friendship. And not from Instagram."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
