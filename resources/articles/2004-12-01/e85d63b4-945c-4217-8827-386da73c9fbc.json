Collectively and individually, they have become daily reading for New York media types [Gawker], LA film people [Defamer], Washington political junkies [Wonkette], computer gamers [Kotaku], gear-heads [Jalopnik] and gadget freaks [Gizmodo] as well as \"enthusiasts\" of pornography\" [Fleshbot].\" Update: links added by popular request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
