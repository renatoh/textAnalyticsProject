The 20-year-old played only twice after the end of the championship because of a hamstring strain and the return of Charlie Hodgson from injury meant Geraghty fell to fourth in the No10 rankings, behind Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood, and, with a glut of centres available, his ability to play in the midfield did not count in his favour as the squad was cut from 46. Geraghty, who marked his Test debut against France with a break from his own half to create the decisive try and seemed to personify England's metamorphosis from plodders to adventurers, became one of three backs released by the England head coach, Brian Ashton. The Gloucester full-back Olly Morgan, who missed the final three months of last season after a shoulder operation, is also released along with the Wasps' centre Fraser Waters. Three forwards will also be missing when the squad gather in Bath next week: Louis Deacon, Andy Hazell and Magnus Lund. The decision to cull Hazell and Lund is surprising as it leaves Tom Rees, who did not train this week because of a knee injury, as the only specialist openside flanker in the squad. Lewis Moody offers cover in that position but he is mostly used on the blind side at club and international level and, given Ashton's preference for a wide game based on continuity, it will make his back row in Rees's absence more one-paced and emphasise the importance of retaining possession. Lund won 10 caps and appeared in all five Six Nations matches this year before going on the summer tour to South Africa. Of the 20 forwards remaining six can play at No8 and, while the back division brims with attacking potential with the young full-backs Danny Cipriani and Nick Abendanon surviving the cut, Ashton looks geared to a physical approach at forward as his side will compete in the same group as South Africa and Samoa. \"It was a difficult decision to let the six players go,\" said Ashton, who on Thursday lost the prop Julian White after the 2005 Lion said he did not have the time to devote to training. \"We had to make the cut because of the need to focus on the warm-up games we have against Wales and France before the deadline for the World Cup squad of 30 to be announced on August 14.\" Ashton will consider releasing more players at the end of next week. By then he will know whether the No8 Dan Ward-Smith and the centre Mike Tindall, who have returned to training this month after long-term injuries, will have a chance of playing in either of next month's pre-deadline friendlies. \"I am not going to comment on who or how many because I have not made those decisions yet,\" said Ashton, who will not be calling in a prop to replace White whose coach at Leicester, Richard Cockerill, blamed England for the 34-year old's decision to put his family and farming business ahead of international rugby. \"He was drained after last November's internationals after he had been wheeled out four weeks in a row,\" said Cockerill. \"We do not play him in four games on the trot: we look after him and to some degree this is England's own fault. Julian had had enough of being away.\" England survivors Backs Abendanon Bath Barkley Bath Catt London Irish Cipriani Wasps Cueto Sale Farrell Saracens Flood Newcastle Gomarsall H'quins Hipkiss Leicester Hodgson Sale Lewsey Wasps Noon Newcastle Perry Bristol Richards L Irish Robinson Sale Sackey Wasps Strettle Hquins Tait Newcastle Tindall Gloucester Wilkinson N'castle Forwards Borthwick Bath Chuter Leicester Corry Leicester Dallaglio Wasps Easter Harlequins Freshwater P'pignan Haskell Wasps Kay Leicester Mears Bath Moody Leicester Palmer Wasps Rees Wasps Regan Bristol Shaw Wasps Sheridan Sale Stevens Bath Vickery Wasps Ward-Smith Bristol Worsley Wasps Yates Saracens"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
