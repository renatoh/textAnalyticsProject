In the past three decades the size of our economy has doubled. Most people own their own homes. Millions take foreign holidays. Music, books and cinema are accessible to the majority. The media and internet provide a wealth of information, knowledge and entertainment. More people study at university than ever. And science is extending the realm of human possibility. But material prosperity has not brought increased satisfaction with life. We have become a more unequal and divided society. Levels of personal debt are unprecedented, and we are time-poor, working long hours either to make ends meet or to buy the ever-changing trappings of success. Alongside economic insecurity a new set of social problems has emerged - widespread mental ill-health, systemic loneliness, growing numbers of psychologically damaged children, eating disorders, obesity, alcoholism and drug addiction. Freedom to shop is poor compensation for the anxiety and insecurity we increasingly feel in our daily lives. The economy may be booming, but we are witnessing a social recession, its symptoms and pain concealed in our private lives. Unless we act now it will turn into a social depression. Nobody in today's politics is offering a way out. Blairism, having run its course, tries to conjure answers for the next 10 years from a three-month review limited to just the cabinet. Compass has been working for more than a year, involving hundreds of academics and specialists and thousands of activists, at meetings and on the web. The outcome is not a blueprint but the start of an even wider debate the whole nation must share in about the kind of society we want. Cameron has his finger on some of these progressive themes, but he offers only old Tory solutions. For social enterprise read withdrawal of the welfare state. For work-life balance read \"voluntary employer-employee agreements\". For gross national wellbeing read maintaining quality of life for the well-off. So the public are leaving the politicians behind. A quarter of 30- to 59-year-olds have made the decision to downsize their lives; 63% of us want green taxes; even big business is lobbying government to do more on the environment. New Labour has failed to stem the tide of poverty growth because it never challenged the reign of free markets by seeking active support for a democratic vision of the good society. Modernity does not lie in unrestricted markets and individualism. Despite its claim of newness, Blairism has failed to understand today's issues such as the demands of environmental sustainability, an ageing population or the politics of wellbeing. Progressive politics is impossible without a vision of what could be. We need to create a society based on the freedom of everyone to flourish. This requires that we all have the resources, time and political recognition to live our lives to the full. We want a culture that understands that humans are interdependent, social and emotional beings, fundamentally oriented towards, and dependent upon, other people. Such a society must have at its core social justice, environmental sustainability and quality of life. These principles lead the way out of the social recession to a good society. Inequality is rife today, with the richest 1% of people owning 25% of the wealth, while the bottom 50% hold only 6%. Our life chances are increasingly determined by family income. More than 11 million people in Britain still live in the solitary desperation of poverty. Our rich nation can easily make tax and benefit changes to address child poverty, and a minimum income standards commission would ensure that benefit levels are enough to live on. We should stop tolerating the fact that the poorest pay a greater share of their income in tax than the rich. To move to a good society we must enact a progressive taxation system, and have the courage to debate it and win advocates for it. Tax by stealth must come to an end. The debate about childhood formation is beginning to erupt. With burgeoning market freedom come growing educational and commercial pressures. There is no single policy that will create an education for flourishing lives or provide the space for children to play rather than just be young shoppers. This is a cultural tide that needs to be turned, but policies such as a ban on advertising to children must now be discussed by our parliament. We need to replace the work ethic with a care ethic. The work ethic assumes individuals are free of each other and entirely self-sufficient. Care underpins our society, and we need it from cradle to grave. The good society would have free social care and universal childcare geared to the needs of children, not just the labour market. We should also protect our weakest workers by raising the minimum wage to a living wage, and end the opt-out to the EU working time directive. And we are experiencing a longevity revolution; by 2050 over-65s will constitute 25% of the population. As a bare minimum we should have a legal duty for age equality, as we have for race and gender equality. We live in a turbulent international system and need to extend progressive principles into global action. A post-Blair politics should revisit the idea of an ethical foreign policy as well as establish new global mechanisms such as a world environment organisation and a global arms trade treaty. Environmental sustainability is the major challenge of our time. If everybody lived like we do in Europe, we would need three planets to sustain us. There is no single easy answer to tackle this, but we must transform our economic activity so that it becomes truly sustainable. We need a range of changes, like following Sweden in setting up a commission on oil independence as well as putting micro-renewables (such as solar panels and turbines) in homes, businesses and public buildings. This is the age of autonomy. People quite rightly want to become the masters of their own destiny. At the moment all they are offered is the chance of buying their way to happiness. If people want to shape the world around them, in their community and at work, it can only be as active citizens working collectively through a democratised state and civil society to create a different and better world. The good society is a vision for a new kind of politics. We will not see it fully enacted in the next parliament, and that might make some say that it is utopian. But amazing institutions like the NHS were once just a dream. We should remember what Friedrich von Hayek, the founder of neoliberalism, said: \"The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the socialists is that it was their courage to be utopian which gained them the support of the intellectuals and thereby an influence on public opinion.\" The good society must now come before the free market. \u00b7 Hetan Shah is policy director at the left-of-centre pressure group Compass; Jonathan Rutherford chairs the Compass Good Society working group.
