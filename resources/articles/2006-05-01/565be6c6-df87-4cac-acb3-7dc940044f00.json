So what, you may say: meat is evil and environmentally-unfriendly. But those of us who can't say no to a bacon sandwich (the downfall of many a would-be vegetarian), might be interested to know that British pig-farmers say they lead the rest of the world on pig welfare. After tempers flared between retailers and farmers in the late 90s over the amount of pork being imported, the British pig industry tried to clean up its act. We are one of only two countries in the EU to have already got rid of all sow-stalls and tethers - practices described by Compassion in World Farming as \"cruel and unnatural\", but only due to be outlawed throughout the rest of Europe in 2013. Castration of piglets - done without anaesthetic - has widely disappeared on UK farms. And we also habitually provide straw for the animals, while on the continent they are often left on bare concrete. This seems to have done the British industry little or no good. It claims that some supermarkets are trying to evade paying the premium on British pork by buying abroad; imports - possibly raised under conditions that would be illegal in this country - are up 35% since 2001. There is no requirement to show the country of origin - \"produced in UK\" could mean it was just butchered here - and some supermarkets use Brit-sounding names on imported meat to create an impression it's home-reared. In desperation, the British Pig Industry Support Group - a farmer's direct-action lobby from the 90s - re-formed last month to fight back and is visiting supermarkets around the country slapping bright red labels on imported pork to warn consumers. And the National Pig Association also runs Porkwatch, keeping an eye on the meat counter. The only guarantee that you are buying British meat, it says, is the Quality Pork Standard union flag. So if you can't afford organic bacon, at least buy British. npa-uk.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
