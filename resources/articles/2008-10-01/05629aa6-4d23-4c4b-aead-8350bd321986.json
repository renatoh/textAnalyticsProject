Jimmy, it transpires, is an emaciated, smack-addicted circus elephant that finds itself pursued across the tundra by squabbling stoners and bungling animal rights activists, pausing only to suffer shuddering spasms of withdrawal beside heaps of gray rocks. Reportedly a cult smash in its homeland, this joyless enterprise has since undergone a lipstick-on-a-pig makeover, courtesy of an \"English translation\" by Simon Pegg that sounds as though it was written in haste and recorded at the read-through. I watched in a state of stupefied horror."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
