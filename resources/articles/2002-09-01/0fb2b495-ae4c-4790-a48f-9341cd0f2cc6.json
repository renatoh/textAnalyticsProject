We will throw them out if they are identified,\" warned Richard Hills, the Ryder Cup director. Picnic baskets, pushchairs, and any bag more than 8in square will also be banned, as well as mobile phones, cameras and pagers. Excuse me if I laugh, but thoughts drift back to the beginning of this year's tennis US Open in New York, where everybody was understandably more than a little jumpy with the anniversary of September 11 so close. There were undercover police everywhere. We could tell that because we were told. \"Hi. My name's Alicia,\" chirruped our hostess as players, officials and journalists settled down in the bus that would take us - usually very slowly - from outside various Manhattan hotels to Flushing Meadows. \"Your driver today is Ed, and this is Arnie, your undercover police officer.\" At this Arnie shut his eyes, and pretended to merge into the background like a hippopotamus in a garden pond. Rumour had it that there were snipers positioned on the top of Arthur Ashe Stadium - with the singular purpose of picking off Argentina's David Nalbandian if he showed any signs of repeating his run to the Wimbledon final, somebody suggested. For whatever reason, they were never seen. Unlike the bag checkers. They were on every gate, and were meticulously trained in the art of sniffing out rogue sandwiches, or anything else that might be sold within the confines of Flushing Meadows where tennis comes a distant second to the big sell. And you simply have not lived unless you have experienced the US Open's chips (crisps to you and me) and tinned cheese. The latter appears translucent as it is poured lovingly into the heater, and re-appears bright orange. Any relationship between this cheese and a cow is purely coincidental. Of course there were some spectators whose bags were so large that they were not allowed into the premises. As if by magic, stalls opened up where it was possible to store such items for a few dollars, and pick them up later. A vicious rumour on the opening day insinuated that the United States Tennis Association were running these storage facilities, although I am sure the organisers of the Ryder Cup have no such plans to rook the public. Of course, for the US Tennis Association to have even hinted that the fans should not heckle the players, or not leave their seats at any time during any of the matches, no matter how crucial the stage of the match, would have been to ask the impossible. The great New York public, having paid to get in, believe the courts are their oyster, cheeseburger, buffalo wing, or whatever. You either love it or loathe it, and for what it's worth I am of the firm belief that if professional sportsmen and women are not capable of dealing with a little bit of noise, movement or heckling then they can jolly well stay at home and watch it on television themselves. A couple of years ago, at the Davis Cup final in Barcelona, the Australians, who were roundly beaten by Spain, spent a good deal of time after the tie whinging about the noise the Spanish fans made. Yet it was the most thrilling and electric of occasions. Tennis players and golfers are far too precious, and in true Gilbert Harding tradition I should make it the sole purpose of any visit to the Belfry this week to heckle either Tiger Woods or Colin Montgomerie at the exact moment when they were lining up the most crucial of putts. And to be thrown out would be a pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
