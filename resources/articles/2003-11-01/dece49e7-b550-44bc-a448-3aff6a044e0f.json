The passage of the health bill follows a climbdown by Tory peers, who abandoned their opposition to the creation of foundation hospitals. But it was the government which had to eat humble pie to ensure the justice bill gets through parliament today, with the home secretary, David Blunkett, being forced to cut a deal with his opposite number, David Davis. The deal will see the provision limiting the right to jury trial in complex fraud cases remain in the bill, but be subject to further debate and a vote in both houses before being implemented by parliamentary order. It also includes the dropping of a provision which would have allowed defendants at crown court to choose trial before a judge sitting without a jury. A Home Office spokesman described the deal on serious fraud trials as \"an honourable draw\", but Tories said it was \"a major government climbdown\". The plans to create semi-autonomous foundation hospitals - which the Lords had already rejected once, and only secured a majority of 17 in the Commons - will now gain royal assent and become law. Foundation hospitals, which will be allowed to raise some of their own finances, were not in the 2001 Labour election manifesto, and was bitterly opposed by former health secretary Frank Dobson, as well as many backbenchers. Announcing the eleventh-hour climbdown, Earl Howe, for the Conservatives, told peers: \"An issue of this kind is essentially one of policy rather than constitutional principle. \"It is not for us to continue to resist the will of the elected house.\" The government survived a close shave in the Commons last night - a massive rebellion by 62 backbenchers, slashing Labour's huge paper majority to just 17. Later, after peers again insisted on rejecting the plans, MPs voted to restore them once more, this time with an increased margin of 41. Earl Howe accused the government of \"arm-twisting tactics\". He said there was \"real and widespread hostility\" to the trusts. But he added: \"This house was right to send an emphatic message to the government yesterday, in rejecting this part of the bill but, like it or not, the Lords have a duty to recognise the validity and strength of the decision of the Commons.\" Labour opponents fear the move will reintroduce a Tory-style internal market within the NHS, and result in hospitals moving towards quicker, or more commercial, operations. Meanwhile, although the Tories have opposed the measures, because they say the plan does not go far enough. In an earlier debate on the bill in the summer, Labour's majority dropped to just 35. The nervousness of the government business managers ahead of Wednesday's debate was underlined when the sports minister, Richard Caborn, was brought back from Australia - missing the Rugby World Cup final - to bolster the vote. The traditional final day \"ping pong\" between the Commons and peers also saw the government defeated again in the Lords over its controversial plans to curb the right to jury trials. Peers voted 163 to 115, a majority of 49, to leave out a key clause in the criminal justice bill which gives the defendant the right to choose a trial by judge alone. The government was defeated for a second time when peers voted to remove a clause giving the prosecution the right to apply for certain lengthy and complex trials to be conducted without a jury. Voting was 160 to 116, a majority of 44. The opposition later accepted clauses to allow the prosecution to apply for a trial to be carried out without a jury where there was a danger of jury tampering. The move came after the government accepted Conservative and Liberal Democrat criticism of the clause. The government suffered a third defeat when peers voted to remove proposals on the extent to which evidence of a person's bad character can be disclosed during a trial. Voting was 166 to 115, a majority of 51."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
