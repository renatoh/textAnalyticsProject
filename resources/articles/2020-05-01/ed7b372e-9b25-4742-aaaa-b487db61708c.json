The output was the lowest level since the second world war, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Only a handful of premium, luxury and sports cars were manufactured, with some smaller factories able to put minor finishing touches on the vehicles. It was the second consecutive month of historically low production. In March 78,767 cars rolled off the production lines, down more than 47,000 on a year earlier. Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and BMW were among the major manufacturers that shut plants in March after the UK lockdown was imposed, faced with the prospect of parts shortages and difficulties protecting workers. The first large plants reopened at the start of May, although others, including Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory, the largest in the UK, will not open until next week. As well as the difficulties of sourcing parts, carmakers have also had to plan for significantly lower demand. Car dealers are among the non-essential retail businesses that can reopen on Monday with new physical distancing rules in place, with the industry hopeful demand for new vehicles will return relatively quickly, as happened after China lifted its lockdown. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cWith the UK\u2019s car plants mothballed in April, these figures aren\u2019t surprising but they do highlight the tremendous challenge the industry faces, with revenues effectively slashed to zero last month. \u201cManufacturers are starting to emerge from prolonged shutdown into a very uncertain world and ramping up production will be a gradual process, so we need government to work with us to accelerate this fundamentally strong sector\u2019s recovery, stimulate investment and safeguard jobs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
