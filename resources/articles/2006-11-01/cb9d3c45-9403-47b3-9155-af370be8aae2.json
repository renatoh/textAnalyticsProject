Before he was 50, he led the blameless, obscure life of a provincial schoolteacher, who moved belatedly into academia. It was after he became professor of education at Leeds University that he shot, in dramatic fashion, to national prominence. Leeds, long a penny-pinching Tory council, was taken over by Labour, which injected \u00a314m into its primary schools. Alexander headed an evaluation team which reported \"a cycle of low expectations and unchallenging curriculum opportunities\". Teachers, it said, were under pressure to adopt \"discovery learning\" and teaching in groups. Career prospects, the report implied, depended on following the Plowden orthodoxy. Alexander's team even criticised the emphasis on classroom wall display, which at the time was like suggesting the Pope should appear at mass without his vestments. Alexander insists the report, which came out in 1991, contained many nuances, and the team had defended the council's \u00a314m investment. But Fleet Street doesn't do nuance, and headlines celebrated a devastating critique of leftwing ideology. The Daily Telegraph hailed it as the educational equivalent of \"the dismantling of the Soviet empire\" and thundered: \"Look on your works, Lady Plowden, and despair.\" It was a gift to a Conservative government facing a general election. John Major, addressing his first Tory conference as prime minister, used the report to support \"a return to basics\" and announced \"the progressive theorists have had their say and ... they've had their day\". \" The report happened to come out at the end of July when there wasn't much news,\" recalls Alexander. \"The government and press got hold of it, and they wouldn't let go.\" Alexander waded deeper into the political quagmire. Ministers invited him, Jim Rose, then chief primary inspector, and Chris Woodhead, then chief executive of the National Curriculum Council (and not yet the notorious figure he became as head of Ofsted), to hold a quick inquiry into \"the delivery of education in primary schools\". Appointed just before Christmas, the inquiry was inevitably dubbed \"the three wise men\". Alexander clearly regrets the outcome. \"The tone was wrong,\" he says. \"It was aggressive, combative ... I'd rather not talk about the dynamics of it; it's too long ago to rake up.\" What's clear, though, is that Woodhead re-drafted what was supposed to be \"a discussion paper\" and the education department's press release hardened it further. \"Call for return to traditional school lessons\", screamed the newspaper headlines. Alexander protested that the message was more mixed; for example, Clarke's pre-inquiry call for a return to streaming was rejected. The press accused him of a U-turn and called him \"one rather unwise man\". Meanwhile, some fellow academics accused him and his co-authors of subjecting Plowden \"to a public deconstruction\". But if some suspected Alexander of being a teacher basher and a cheerleader for chalk-and-talk, he has given them ample cause to rethink. Nobody has been more critical of the narrowness of testing and the individual competitiveness it encourages. Woodhead lined him up with the late Ted Wragg as one who wished to replace literacy and numeracy with \"individual empowerment and social progress\". So will the primary review lead to another punch-up? \"I think times have changed,\" says Alexander. \"The debate was ludicrously polarised in the early 1990s. It was heavy on scapegoating and gross over-simplification of the issues. The political discourse has moved on. People are more prepared, in government and in the profession, to entertain complexity.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
