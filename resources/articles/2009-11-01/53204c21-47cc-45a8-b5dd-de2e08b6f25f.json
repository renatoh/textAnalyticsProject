Private equity firms backed by some of Wall Street's biggest players and wealthy institutions from the Gulf and the far east are poised to step in and buy the businesses no longer wanted by state-owned banks. But a rebranded high street with several new banks will be difficult to achieve without taxpayers losing billions of pounds, senior City figures warned tonight. Potential buyers are expected to tell ministers they are looking for bargains in the sell-off by Lloyds and RBS and are unlikely to meet price tags that will compensate the government for the bailout. The warning is likely to dismay ministers who have pinned their hopes of creating a breed of simple high street banks on new entrants to the sector generating more competition. Despite the financial crisis, private equity firms remain poised with billions of pounds to invest in UK businesses. Sovereign wealth funds representing countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Norway, bulging with receipts from oil and gas, are also waiting for opportunities to invest in areas that could boost their profits. China Bank, which forged links with RBS before the crash and has begun offering mortgages to UK homeowners, could also be interested. Tesco has ruled itself out of the running, as the Guardian revealed last week, preferring to start its own banking operation. But Sir Richard Branson's Virgin, which recently applied for a banking licence, could bid for Northern Rock. National Australia Bank, which owns the Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks, is also thought to be a possible buyer. Several private equity firms have already invested in the beleaguered US finance industry. Some early entrants lost billions of dollars attempting to rescue bust banks, but recent investments have generated huge gains. Senior industry executives said uncertainty about UK banking reforms and the cost and scope of new regulations was likely to put off most private equity firms and foreign buyers for several years. The few firms prepared to bid will probably drive a hard bargain with the government and force taxpayers to take a loss on the multibillion-pound bailouts. The private equity entrepreneur Jon Moulton, who came to prominence with a bid for MG Rover in 2000 before its controversial takeover by the Phoenix consortium, said: \"The willingness of the people in the larger funds to put up the money is undoubted. They are sitting on more money than they were before the crash, which gives an idea of the wall of money waiting to find a home. \"Many of the big American firms \u2013 the Blackstones, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Carlyle Groups \u2013 have the funds in place. They have the \u00a35bn needed to buy a bank, and then there are the sovereign wealth funds that will put up the \u00a310bn needed to kickstart lending. \"But it all depends on how the new entities are gift-wrapped. The price of buying bank assets and the regulatory landscape will need to be conducive.\" Moulton said ministers were unlikely to smile at the bids. \"The sale price may not be what the taxpayer is looking for. We might need to sell them off cheaply and accept that what we get in return for saving the banks is simpler and less risky institutions and a more competitive sector overall.\" Darling will tell parliament on Tuesday that he has persuaded the European commission to defer asset sales in order to allow new entrants a chance to buy a slice of the UK banking sector. However, a senior banker warned the government might not get the price it wanted. \"The government will need to offer sweeteners,\" he said. \"RBS has already tried to sell some of its businesses \u2026 but could not get a decent price.\" Another said: \"The uncertainties around regulatory reforms, both here and in the EU, mean private equity will set the bar higher when they look at bank businesses. By the normal standards of due diligence, banks throw up more red flags than usual businesses.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
