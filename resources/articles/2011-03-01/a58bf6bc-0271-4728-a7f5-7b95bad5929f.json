Immediately after the Oscar ceremony he appeared in a sketch by the comedian Jimmy Kimmel having fun with The King's Speech and George Dubya's inability to master linguistics. He plays the therapist role, attending George's most infamous gaffes, the sketch concluding as the boxer, billed as \"Sir Michael Tyson\", tearfully applauds George solemnly intoning: \"I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\" He then put his own language skills on show days later, when he told the talk show host Gayle King: \"I was the quintessential target to be bullied.\" It was his high-pitched voice apparently, rather than the use of the word \"quintessential\" in his 'hood, that had been to blame. He'd worked at it, however. \"It's not as high-pitched as it used to be because I smoke now,\" he said. \"I used to smoke to make my voice huskier. I hate my voice.\" His childhood was revisited again when another host, NBC's Jimmy Fallon, challenged him to a game of Rock'em Sock'em Robots (the plastic animatronic blue-and-red-robot toy popularised in the Sixties and Seventies). Fallon explained that \"the goal of the game is that you have to knock the other dude's head off,\" and counted in the fight, at which point Iron Mike grabbed the host's robot and pulled its head off, to the delight of the crowd. All of which media blitz was, of course, really to promote his new show, Taking On Tyson. The fighter has long been known for his love of keeping and breeding pigeons and the programme (Discovery Channel, this Friday, 9pm) follows him pitting his birds against other racing enthusiasts. An odd enough premise, that becomes decidedly surreal when you factor in a voice-over provided by Michael Kenneth Williams \u2013 AKA Omar from The Wire. But Mike is taking it entirely seriously. The birds display, he told ESPN, \"potential, but you can't really know until you see them in action. Just like a fighter in the gym.\" It's tough on the trainer, too: \"Racing homers is a lot of work. If you don't race them, that's more of a fat man's sport,\" he said. There's also the occasional in-loft squabble to deal with, and the fighter is forced to act as referee when one is dominating another, if \"he's just bullying him, maybe he's even beating up his woman \u2013 then I pick that guy out ... It's like a guy in prison who can't hang out with the other prisoners, so they have to put him in the hole!\" Sadly, this touchy-feely Mike, making animal lovers coo, went on to rather let himself down, and possibly make his pigeons nervous, by revealing: \"I went to a cockfight in Mexico. They wore gloves, like a boxer \u2013 that was good ... They'd still get bad gashes, but they weren't fighting to the death. I'm not a fan of that, when they fight to the death. I believe that you should let the dogs fight, let the roosters fight, but let the loser live to fight another day.\" ECUADOR Extortion gangs put footballers in peril Ecuadorian footballers are being told to pay money to gang members \u2013 or risk their lives. Last week Liga de Quito star Luis \"Chucho\" Bola\u00f1os the victim of a motorcycle drive-by shooting outside one of the Ecuadorian capital's biggest shopping centres. The striker took a bullet in the shoulder \u2013 one of four that were fired \u2013 but is confident he will be playing again within a fortnight. The ex-Santos and Internacional player said: \"I'm a lot better now. Fortunately, the bullets did not hit any bone, organ, nerve or artery.\" El Nacional's Fricson Erazo explained: \"I have many team-mates who have gone through this situation. We're not talking about any old amount of money, we're talking US$10,000 or $15,000. If you go out to an entertainment spot, they just take you out and find a way of getting to you, involving your family.\" His team-mate Edison Preciado added: \"When you go out on to the streets you don't know if you're going to come back alive.\" NIGERIA Authorities count cost after wasted US trip The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) seem destined to blunder from one unfortunate calamity to another, no better illustrated than by their recent loss of a huge amount of money in expenses, air travel and accommodation, leaving them \"furious and embarrassed\". The Super Eagles had been booked to take part in the Green Bowl Tournament in the US, a four-nation competition put together by the America-based Nigerian Pius Oleh. The delegation of 20 players and nine officials flew from Lagos to Atlanta and on to Dallas, where they learnt that they were the only participants to actually turn up as the organisers had \"postponed\" the tournament due to ticketing problems. \"We are not going to take this lightly,\" said the NFF president, Aminu Maigari, who is becoming used to his firefighting role, and trying to make amends. \"We apologise to Nigerians and the government for this unfortunate incident,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
