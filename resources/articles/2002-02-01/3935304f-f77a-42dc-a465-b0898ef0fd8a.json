Probably not. If you miss the farmers' market and the Sainsbury's organic range when you go away, and worry about the pesticides in your croissants, try consulting this international directory of organic holiday establishments. Will they all feed me local produce? Not always. Some of the farms involved run self-catering cottages on their estates, so you might end up staying next to an organic Sicilian vineyard on the slopes of Etna. Others take the form of annual events and festivals - the Gardening Brigade to Cuba for organo-communists, for instance, or the Neo-humanist Ecology Festival in Poland. Neo-humanist? I wasn't sure either, but further research suggests it involves some challenging yoga and a radical social philosophy. Bread-making and beekeeping are also on offer. Those seem rather extreme, even for my tastes. I'd just like to stay on a farm, perhaps in Wales, and eat home-cooked organic suppers and drink the local spring water. Then the Blaen-y-ddol guesthouse in Ceredigion sounds ideal for you. It costs \u00a3216 for a week's full board and walking guides. I'm going to Australia. Perhaps the Kia-Ora farm in New South Wales? It harbours platypus. Who runs the site? Linda Moss of Leeds. This is not an agency, however, just a listings service, and you must contact the owners of the farms (who usually have their own websites) if you want to book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
