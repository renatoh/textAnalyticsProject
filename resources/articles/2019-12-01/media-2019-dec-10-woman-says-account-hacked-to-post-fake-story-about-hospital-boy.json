The woman denied posting the allegation that four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr\u2019s mother placed him on the floor specifically to take the picture which became symbolic of the NHS\u2019s troubles after it appeared on the front page of Monday\u2019s Daily Mirror. \u201cI was hacked. I am not a nurse and I certainly don\u2019t know anyone in Leeds,\u201d said the woman, whose name the Guardian is withholding because she says she has received death threats. \u201cI\u2019ve had to delete everything as I have had death threats to myself and my children.\u201d The original viral post on the medical secretary\u2019s Facebook account said, \u201cI am a nurse myself\u201d and cited a \u201cgood friend of mine\u201d at Leeds General. It claimed the boy in the photo \u201cwas in fact put there by his mother who then took photos on her mobile phone and then uploaded it to media outlets\u201d. The post dismissed the pictures of the ill boy as \u201canother Momentum propaganda story\u201d, despite the fact the hospital had already apologised for his treatment. The medical secretary said she had tried to report the hack of her Facebook account to the advice service Action Fraud, although this claim could not be verified. Claims that the photo was staged spread rapidly across social media and messaging services on Monday night, potentially reaching millions of people after being amplified by celebrities, journalists, and at least five Conservative candidates. The row over Jack\u2019s treatment has become a central part of the election campaign, with Boris Johnson being criticised for repeatedly refusing to look at the photograph he was shown by a journalist during an interview on Monday. Despite the claim that the photo was staged having been acknowledged as false, it has continued to spread on both Facebook and Twitter, largely through individual low-follower accounts cutting and pasting the original text to share with their friends. One version, posted by a man who claims to work for the British army\u2019s intelligence corps, has received 2,000 shares on Facebook; another, from a person saying they were a former soldier, has received a further 500. The same claim was shared on Twitter, where it was spread by much more significant accounts. The Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson retweeted screenshots of the Facebook page to her followers twice, telling them \u201cI presume this is genuine\u201d, and adding later that the photo was \u201c100% faked\u201d. Her posts have received thousands of retweets between them. According to the researcher Marc Owen Jones, Pearson is \u201cperhaps the most influential proponent of the faked floor theory\u201d, although a tweet from the former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen sent to Piers Morgan may have been seen by more people as a one-off. While many of the users who initially posted the claims to Twitter shared it with identical wording, there is little indication that the false narrative is being artificially boosted by automated accounts. Twitter metadata shows the vast majority of the tweets were posted through the social network\u2019s website or smartphone apps, and the accounts sharing them overwhelmingly appear to be those of real people with an interest in politics. Despite claims of a staged photo, Leeds General Infirmary has confirmed that Jack did suffer due to an exceptionally busy week. \u201cOur hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack\u2019s family had a long wait in our emergency department,\u201d said Dr Yvette Oade, the chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS trust. \u201cWe are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family.\u201d It emerged on Tuesday that five Tory candidates had used social media to spread the idea that the story may have been a hoax or that his mother had faked it. Michael Fabricant, Scott Benton and Wendy Maisey all shared a screenshot of the claims circulating on rightwing social media accounts. Maisey, standing in Warrington North, tweeted: \u201cDisgusting what some people will do to sway an election,\u201d and shared the social media comment from the original Facebook account. Former MP Karl McCartney, who is standing in his former seat of Lincoln, shared rightwing supporter and former Ukip deputy chair Jay Beecher\u2019s tweets in which he said he was in direct touch with a nurse from the hospital who could dispel the story. McCartney has already been forced to apologise in this campaign for retweeting posts from former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and far-right commentator Katie Hopkins, which contained anti-Muslim and antisemitic material. Scott Benton, standing in Blackpool South, retweeted a comment that suggested Labour must have seen the polls and then faked the incident. He then deleted the tweet. Neva Novaky, standing in Garston and Halewood, commenting on a radio report about people claiming it was a hoax, tweeted: \u201cWe should investigate this.\u201d Fabricant, who is defending Lichfield, also shared the message, writing a comment: \u201cIs This True?\u201d. He also retweed an image of Jack with a caption \u201cmask wasn\u2019t even on face\u201d. Ian Lavery, Labour party chair, said: \u201cThe fact that Boris Johnson could not even bring himself to look at the photo was bad enough, but for his Conservative candidates to share a far-right conspiracy theory claiming it was a hoax is just sickening. These Tory candidates are not fit to be MPs. Boris Johnson must take action immediately.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
