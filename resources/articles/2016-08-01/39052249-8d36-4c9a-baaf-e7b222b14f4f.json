The surrounding area, where a partial solar eclipse is seen, does not extend as far north as Europe. A second eclipse occurs on the 16th when the Moon passes through the southern edge of the Earth\u2019s shadow. The resulting penumbral lunar eclipse is already underway as the Harvest Moon rises in the E for western Europe on that evening. The Moon first touches the shadow at 17:55 BST while still below Britain\u2019s horizon and reaches greatest eclipse at 19:54, 30 minutes or so after moonrise. All but the southern 9% of the lunar disc then lies within the penumbra, but little darkening may be obvious except near its upper edge, closest to the shadow\u2019s dark central umbra. The Moon exits the penumbra at 21:54. Jupiter remains hidden in the Sun\u2019s glare, but Venus is brilliant in the evening twilight, albeit only 6\u00b0 high in the W at sunset at present, and no higher in the SW by month\u2019s end. Easier to spy is the triangle of Mars, Saturn and the star Antares in Scorpius which stands low in the SSW as darkness falls and after Venus sets. Antares, the dimmest of the three, stands below Saturn while Mars, the brightest, lies to their E (left) and speeds 18\u00b0 away during the month to approach the lid of the Teapot of Sagittarius, just setting in the SW at our map times. Mars dims from mag -0.3 to 0.1 while Saturn is mag 0.5. The slender young Moon lies 3\u00b0 above-left of Venus on the 3rd, and is close to first quarter when it stands a similar distance above-right of Saturn on the 8th and 7\u00b0 above Mars on the 9th. Mercury emerges from the Sun\u2019s far side to begin its best morning apparition of 2016 late in the month. Between the 24th to 30th, it brightens from mag 0.5 to -0.6 and rises more than 95 minutes before the Sun to stand 8\u00b0 or more above the E horizon forty minutes before sunrise. Catch it 1.9\u00b0 to the left of the very slim earthlit Moon on the 29th.
