He was expected to stand down in a historic address live on television after conceding to military takeover. But instead he clings to power following a rambling speech which left the nation stunned and baffled. In a statement delivered in Harare he claimed military intervention, which saw him placed under house arrest four days ago, was no challenge to his authority. The army stepped in to block Grace Mugabe\u2019s tilt at power. Speaking slowly and occasionally stumbling as he read from pages, Mugabe talked of the need for solidarity to resolve national problems. He ended his speech by saying he will preside over an upcoming conference of the ruling Zanu-PF party. His defiance comes despite his sacking by Zanu-PF and in the face of huge public opposition. The news means widespread disappointment for those who thought they were witnessing the end of the Mugabe era and celebrated in euphoric scenes in the streets of Zimbabwe yesterday. His refusal to go plunges the country into deep uncertainty. The leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential war veterans said plans for impeachment would go ahead as scheduled.

He was in prison for 10 years, he fought his way through until Zimbabweans gained their own independence in 1980. So there are people who still respect him even though they want him to step down so their lives can move on and that is why we don\u2019t have a Gaddafi moment today.\u201d Reacting to Mugabe\u2019s speech, BBC news analyst Milton Nkosi said: \u201cHe has vowed to stay on.

He was flanked by generals as he gave his speech - he tripped over his words and towards the end said: \u201coh that\u2019s a long speech\u201d.
