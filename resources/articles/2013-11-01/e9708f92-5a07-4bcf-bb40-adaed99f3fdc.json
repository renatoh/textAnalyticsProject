What is the best role for the major figures of the Blair and Brown years in the party of the next decade? Naturally, there is no universal answer to the question. New Labour's ex-ministers are not a homogeneous regiment under anyone's command. But they are, collectively and individually, a political resource that has not been particularly well deployed in the Ed Miliband years thus far. They and he need to give more collegiate thought to their role in the future, if they have one. Labour's ex-ministers march to many different political and career drums. But they have two significant things in common. They have government experience. And they are not old. For these reasons, they all need to weigh whether, and in what way, they can best assist their party over the coming decade. Even if Labour were to win an overall majority in 2015, it will face difficult years and will need all the wise heads it can muster. Labour is not so over-endowed with such wisdom that Mr Miliband can afford to ignore all of them. Broadly speaking, there are four options for Labour's senior veterans. They can run again, perhaps in hope of retaining a political voice and maybe even office. They can step down in the hope of moving to the Lords, where a voice and office are possible too. They can step down and pursue, whether in the Lords or outside parliament, a Labour career in a different way \u2013 Ms Jowell may be about to do this by running for the Labour nomination as London mayoral candidate. Or they can withdraw altogether and tend their gardens. No one solution suits all cases, obviously enough. And there comes a time when the call of the garden should be answered. But Labour has a lot of greying talent that Mr Miliband would be foolish to squander and ignore. From Mr Blair and Mr Brown downwards, there are experienced people who can play useful roles in the right positions, as campaigners, advisers, envoys, candidates or even, in some cases, ministers. Men and women of the calibre of Alistair Darling, Jack Straw, Peter Mandelson, Alan Johnson, Peter Hain, Ms Jowell and others have much to offer, in the right roles. Mr Miliband should encourage them. Hopefully, several Labour ex-ministers can be persuaded to stand again in 2015. Their party still needs them. So, arguably, does their country. Where they are not so needed, however, is in the House of Lords. Mr Miliband should encourage the veterans to stand as MPs, or in other useful political roles. They should respond to such overtures. But Mr Miliband should resist the claims of ex-ministers to an automatic seat in the unreformed Lords."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
