On one hand they have seen much of their core repertory given a facelift by the period-instrument bands, while on the other, the rise of more youthful ensembles, such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, has brought an extra freshness to programme building. The ASMF then is in need of some new blood, and perhaps part of that reinvigoration is the appointment of Murray Perahia as the group's principal guest conductor. He made his debut in that role here. Perahia is the latest in a long line of distinguished performers to be lured away from the piano stool and onto the podium, though the substance of this programme was a pair of piano concertos in which he doubled as soloist and conductor. As the Academy had already shown in the overture to Handel's Alcina, they are more than capable of turning in efficient, if not especially stylish, performances when led from the front desk of the violins by Kenneth Sillito. Their accompaniments to both Mozart's C major Concerto K503 and Bach's D major Keyboard Concerto BWV1054 were perfectly attentive too, as Perahia devoted most of his attention to the piano. Whether he was comfortable in the dual role was more debatable. Mozart has always been one of his specialities, but this account of the most ceremonial of all the concertos lacked the pearly fluency and darting insights he usually brings. Some of his playing was surprisingly perfunctory and hard-edged, and the sense of a really intimate, chamber-like dialogue between the piano and the orchestra was never suggested. The Bach was better, if you can stomach the sound of a piano and modern strings in such a piece. But Mozart's Prague Symphony was nothing special. Perahia is too fastidious a musician to do anything unnecessary, but he could have imposed himself a bit more: the first movement was tepid, the Andante routine. The playing was tidy enough, but the question of whether the ASMF had gained anything from having this fine musician in front of them was never convincingly answered. \u0095 A version of this review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper."}, "isHosted": false}}}
