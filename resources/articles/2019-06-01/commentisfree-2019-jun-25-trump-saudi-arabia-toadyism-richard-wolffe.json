With a re-election year kicking off, everyone wants to know if the candidate can fill in the gaping holes in his record, to give voters some reason to hope or believe. In the case of Donald Trump, that means trying to look like something he hasn\u2019t been for the last two and a half years: presidential, sane and worthy of the world\u2019s respect. Just for once. So there are the TV interviews with networks other than Fox News, including the one with ABC News where he was supposed to look normal but ended up saying he\u2019d accept more Russian dirt in the upcoming election. If only to see if it was any good. Totally presidential. There was the decisive moment when he turned the jets around as they were about to bomb Iran: an act of leadership that overruled his hawkish aides, as well as his earlier decision to, um, bomb Iran. Totally commander-in-chief. And then there was the interview with NBC News, where he readily admitted that he puts a higher value on arms deals with Saudi Arabia than on American values like democracy and human rights. Totally making America great again. Pressed by NBC, Trump made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less about the bone saw-wielding murderers who dismembered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly on the orders of the Saudi crown prince himself. He also couldn\u2019t care about the UN\u2019s recommendations that the FBI investigate the murder of Khashoggi, who was a US resident and wrote for the Washington Post. Unable to muster any human feeling, Trump couldn\u2019t muster any rational answers either. \u201cI think it\u2019s been heavily investigated,\u201d Trump said. When asked who had done all that heavy investigating, he blurted out: \u201cBy everybody \u2026 I\u2019ve seen so many different reports.\u201d Seeing is normally believing, but in Trump\u2019s case that might not be true. \u201cHere\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said, warming to the subject of international relations. \u201cYou ready?\u201d It\u2019s not at all clear if the world is ready for this kind of train of thought, even after all these many years of blather. You see, according to Trump there are other countries that do bad things, like Iran. And they do so many bad things that Iran is totally worth investigating. This kind of argument somewhat undermines the presidential moment that averted war with Iran, but let\u2019s not set our standards too high. Because there was more of this brain fart to follow. \u201cI\u2019m not like a fool that says, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do business with them.\u2019 And by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese. They will buy \u2013 we make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China,\u201d he told Chuck Todd of NBC News. \u201cChuck, take their money. Take their money, Chuck.\u201d Trump has already said that his re-election slogan is \u201cKeep America Great,\u201d as if the next four years will be a desperate exercise in clinging on to what he thinks he\u2019s achieved, such as avoiding impeachment. This is a shame because \u201cTake Their Money\u201d is a far more authentic one-liner about this president. At least it suggests that the Trump project is an ongoing enterprise. To be fair, the Trump administration is hardly the first to overlook every human rights abuse by the Saudi regime in the single-minded pursuit of oil, money and power. Previous presidents and prime ministers were also surprisingly capable of ignoring the kingdom\u2019s oppression of women and its love of state-sanctioned death by beheading. In fact, the Saudis decapitated 37 men just a few weeks ago, most of them minority Shia Muslims who were denied a fair trial. Some of them were children at the time of their sentencing. None of them were Washington Post journalists, and the killings received far less attention. Perhaps we care more about beheadings after Isis. Perhaps we think the Saudis should live up to the so-called reform agenda of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Perhaps the bonesaw was just too horrific to ignore. Whatever the reason, Trump\u2019s desire to sell arms to the Saudis flies in the face of his own Republicans, as well as all the Democrats who already consider his foreign policy about as credible and responsible as the Saudi reforms. Just last week Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to vote repeatedly to block US arms sales to the Saudis and the Gulf states, while the Trumpistas tried to run around Congress by declaring an emergency over Iran. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Congress voted to cut off US support for the brutal Saudi-backed war in Yemen. Trump vetoed Congress before and will surely do so again. All the chest-beating about Iran, as well as all the backtracking on military strikes, needs to be seen in this context about Trump\u2019s curious love affair with the Saudis. It\u2019s a romance that has left even the few close friends of Donald Trump in a position of downright opposition, including the otherwise sycophantic Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cThere is no amount of oil you can produce that will get me and others to give you a pass on chopping somebody up in a consulate,\u201d Graham said, after leading the legislation against the arms sales to the Saudis. There is just one other country that elicits such a bizarrely determined and loyal attachment from Donald Trump: Russia. That foreign entanglement also causes head-scratching rifts with his own toadying Republicans. But nobody should find Trump\u2019s attitudes to Russia and Saudi Arabia hard to understand. We might not have his tax returns, but we do have Trump\u2019s succinct summary of his motives: take the money, Chuck.
