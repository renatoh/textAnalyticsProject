The industry, which is now worth more than \u00a37.5bn a year, includes payday loan businesses, such as Wonga, issuing almost 10,600 short-term loans a day; doorstep lenders \u2013 Provident Financial, for instance, has more than 2.7 million customers; and rent-to-own businesses including BrightHouse and PerfectHome that offer long-term hire purchase for basic goods at high interest rates. Profits have soared as millions have been hit by the cumulative impact of a cut in benefits, wages falling by an average of \u00a31,500 since 2010 and a 25% rise in the cost of living, pushing the poor closer to penury and the previously reasonably well paid into ever deeper debt. \"Many people are really feeling the pinch. Irresponsible lending risks pushing them over the edge and causes serious and long-term damage to their finances, families and health,\" the charter says. \"The high-cost lending industry has proved incapable of self-regulation; it is now time for government and regulators to step in and offer consumers real protection [and] a major expansion of affordable alternative sources of credit.\" On Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), that in April 2014 takes over the regulation of the 50,000 firms with consumer credit licences, unveiled a two-month consultation on a series of rules to regulate the sector. They include limiting payday loan rollovers that can lead to interest rates in excess of 5,000%; affordability checks on borrowers; and restricting to twice the use of continuous payment authorities (CPAs). Known as \"siphoning\", these allow a lender to take money from a borrower's account, charging for as many as 90 \"dips\", whether successful or not, at \u00a35 a time, leaving an individual with nothing on which to live. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, promises, \"Tougher regulation is coming\u2026 the clock is ticking.\" Errol Damelin, chief executive of Wonga, says: \"We want better regulation\u2026 we want to keep the bad guys out.\" Supporters of the charter say the FCA's proposals don't go far enough fast enough, nor are they tough enough. \"We are pleased that the FCA is planning action to clean up credit,\" says Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director. \"However, the regulator needs to go further. We want it to clamp down on irresponsible lending across the credit market, including capping sky-high penalty charges, freezing charges for people in financial difficulty and ending unsolicited credit increases.\" The charter, which is set to be launched on 15 October at the House of Commons, includes a prohibition on loans to people who realistically are unable to pay them back; allowance for only one rollover; an end to \"hidden\" charges; clear information; independent debt advice; greater encouragement to banks to help 7.8 million people who have no access to mainstream credit, and better support for credit unions that provide low-cost loans. \"This is a once in a generation opportunity, \" says Blomfield, whose high-cost credit private members' bill failed this year. \"It mustn't be lost.\" High-cost credit hits two groups particularly badly. The first is the unemployed and those on a low income. A new report, Drowning in Debt, published next week by CAP, the Centre for Responsible Credit (CRC) and Thrive Teesside, a community organisation, all of whom have also worked with Durham University on a two-year project following 24 families in debt, shows the absurdities of the high-cost credit market. Of 7.8m loans given last year, 2.6m were written off. The higher the risk, the greater the cost levied and the bigger the bounce in profits. Defaults produce half the industry's profits. A report published by Durham University later this month shows how the seduction of customers is relentless. One woman had 25 loans with seven different doorstep lending companies. \"You never got asked if you could afford it. It was just here, here and here.\" \"Doorstep lending is not usually sought by the households, rather it finds its way to them,\" says Professor Sarah Banks, who is in charge of the project. \"What matters for people in financial crisis who are borrowing to live is the speed at which the money arrives, not the rate of interest.\" \"High-debt families are particularly targeted,\" agrees Niall Cooper of CAP. He points out that the poor pay \"a poverty premium\" for food, fuel and finance \u2013 an extraordinary \u00a34bn extra a year. \"People are on the breadline because of market failure across the board.\" Cooper adds that lenders should have an obligation to ensure families are left with sufficient money to live on. He and Damon Gibbons, of the CRC, argue that real time data sharing, giving details of a person's income and outgoings (which is not proposed by the FCA) is essential, otherwise judging \"affordability\" will be a sham. Graham Clarke runs an RTO called Buy as You View. After negotiations with CAP and Thrive, and the introduction of improved technology, \"good\" customers \u2013 he reckons 75% of the total of 80,000 \u2013 are given lower interest rates and the majority pay by direct debit. The \"good\" customer no longer pays heavily for the bad debts of the minority. Last year Buy as You View made \u00a34m in profit, considerably less than its rivals. Clarke says: \"I'm no white knight, but I want to do it the right way. I have investors who want to do well, but that means by fair profitability, not extortion. \"Once we borrowed for the high life, now many borrow to get by. Yet far too many in the industry are in it for the fast buck with a 'one size fits all' approach to the credit impaired that hasn't changed for years.\" In addition to fairer terms, Gibbons and Cooper want people to be helped from a \u00a3500m fund possibly levied from the industry, if proper checks reveal they are not creditworthy. Debt, they point out, comes at a price for all taxpayers. It significantly increases the chances of relationship breakdown and mental ill health. Stella Creasy, Labour MP, has also called for a cap on total costs. \"The FCA says capping won't work. That's hokum. It works in Canada, Japan and parts of the US. A ripoff is a ripoff.\" For the first time, the price of high- cost credit is also having an impact on higher earners, too. \"Many of us are only a salary cheque away from falling into debt,\" says Peter Tutton, of StepChange. \"Things happen, \" he stressed. Kenny, 46, earns \u00a340,000 a year working in information technology. Two years ago rising living costs meant that his income stopped matching his outgoings. Three credit cards are maxed out, the bank was unhelpful and he cancelled direct debits to juggle money, followed by three payday loans. Debt management companies took hundreds. Then he went to StepChange. Now he is repaying \u00a318,000, month by month. He is constantly bombarded with new loan offers. He drives 40 miles a day to work; his car is decrepit and he is worried that he might succumb again. \"I never imagined this would happen to me.\" Graham, 46, is a manager on \u00a363,000 a year and a mortgage of \u00a31,100 a month After four failed IVF attempts, his wife, a pharmacist, unexpectedly became pregnant, reducing her work to two days a week. \"We were living within our means, then our means went sharply down.\" Graham acquired a loan, credit cards and payday loans from five companies, paying 1,000% interest on one. \"Nine o'clock at night with the laptop, a click, and the money is in the bank in two hours and not a single check. It's so tempting.\" Debts of \u00a314,000 are now being paid off at a hefty \u00a3762 a month. \"Potentially, I was going to lose my home, my wife and my baby. I wasn't the kind of person to which this happens.\" \"The high-cost credit market is out of control and does not deal with its customers fairly,\" says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \"We need consumers to have real choice and we need remedial steps now, not in 2014, to make good the damage that has already been done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
