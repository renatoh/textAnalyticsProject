Robbie Keane's first-half goal should have been complemented by others, but the home side remain unconvincing in the matter of putting opponents to sleep. Celtic's vulnerability throughout this trying season has left their supporters with a habit of celebrating goals with reservations, as if they are wondering how long it will take for their unreliable midfield and defence to commit the error that will allow an equaliser. That element of trepidation seemed once again to be mixed in with the celebration of the goal from Keane that gave them a lead they had not exactly threatened. There had been too much sluggish and imprecise play in the preceding 20 minutes to suggest they would suddenly produce the required quality of pass and incisiveness of finish. It was Diomansy Kamara who made the pass, releasing Keane through the middle with a ball of such penetration that the Republic of Ireland striker had only to place it either side of the advancing Dusan Pernis at the right moment to guarantee the lead. This he did by sliding it to the left of the goalkeeper with his right foot. It would be rather an isolated moment of genuinely menacing football from the home side during a largely bland first half, in which United seemed strangely content to try to hit occasionally on the break. Given Celtic's tendency to self-destruct, anyone would have thought that a little more adventurousness from the visitors would have proved profitable. As it was, their main threat came from set pieces, the best example being John Daly's header from a corner kick on the right that sent the ball marginally wide of Artur Boruc's right-hand post. Celtic would have doubled their advantage on the only other occasion before the interval on which they penetrated the United defence but for an extraordinary intervention from Michael Kovacevic. It was Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9's nice footwork on the right that allowed him to drive the low cross into the six-yard box, towards the lurking Keane. He appeared as shocked as the home support when Kovacevic appeared from nowhere to deflect the ball for a corner. But Celtic's largely dominant second half, marked by a series of excellent opportunities would merely cause deeper apprehension among fans who would fret over their failure to exploit their superiority and wonder if they would once again be punished. Apart from blatant misses such as Fortun\u00e9's miscue of a lob from Keane on the right \u2013 this from eight yards out \u2013 there was the sound work of Pernis in the visitors' goal. The Slovakian was especially impressive when he foiled Celtic's most fluent move of the match to that point. Kamara broke down the left and swept the pass across to Scott Brown on the right and the captain played Keane into the right side of the area with a perfectly measured ball along the ground. The striker hit the shot on the run and drew an excellent save from Pernis. The first scare from United arrived soon after Jennison Myrie-Williams replaced Danny Swanson and received a clever free-kick from Craig Conway on the right. Having wrongfooted the home defence, Myrie-Williams sent his right-foot shot just wide. The substitute would be involved in the next moment of alarm when his pass into the area was touched on by the stretching Celtic substitute Lee Naylor and into the path of Daly. The striker would have equalised but for Boruc's alertness, the goalkeeper arriving in time to spread himself and make the block. None of this was likely to help Celtic's beleaguered manager, Tony Mowbray, to improve his esteem in the minds of the home fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
