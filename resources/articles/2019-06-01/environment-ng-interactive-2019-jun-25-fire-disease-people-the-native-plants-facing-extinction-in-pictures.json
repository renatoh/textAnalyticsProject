This is certainly the case in Australia, where plants make up 72% of the total threatened species list, with 1,308 listed species, and 370 species listed as critically endangered or endangered at a state level. This accelerating decline in the world\u2019s biodiversity will have grave consequences for human society, according to the UN\u2019s recent global assessment report. In Australia, recent research by the Threatened Species Recovery Hub listed the 100 plants that are most at risk. Dr Jennifer Silcock from the University of Queensland said the list, published in the Australian Journal of Botany, showed the main threats were urbanisation, inappropriate fire regimes, introduced plant disease and habitat loss. \u201cThe good news is that every one of the species on the list can be saved, we have the techniques required, we just need the commitment,\u201d said co-researcher Dr Rod Fensham. \u201cThe fate of these species depends upon support and action from governments and the community. A bonus will be that the actions required to save these species will also benefit many other vulnerable plant species.\u201d The below gallery shows the types of plants at risk, the regions at risk and the major threats, with an example for each category. Research to identify the Australian plants at greatest risk of extinction was undertaken by the Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the federal government\u2019s National Environmental Science Program.
