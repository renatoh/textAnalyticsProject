His legacy is to some extent overshadowed by the dramatic nature of his dismissal as prime minister. Yet in three years in the role Whitlam managed to forge himself into the key figure in the shaping of modern Australia. He pioneered reforms in Aboriginal rights, multiculturalism, university education and healthcare. And, though he had detractors in and outside Labor, Whitlam managed to turn a demoralised and divided party into a relevant political machine, preparing it for power not just during his tenure but in the 13 years of continuous Labor government from 1983. On the day of Whitlam\u2019s dismissal, 11 November 1975 \u2013 amid a bitter constitutional crisis which is still fiercely debated \u2013 he famously proclaimed: \u201cWell may we say God save the Queen, because nothing will save the governor general.\u201d The Queen\u2019s official representative, the governor general, Sir John Kerr \u2013 whom Whitlam had appointed \u2013 had used his reserve powers to sack the government. True to Whitlam\u2019s prediction, Kerr never recovered from the ignominy of the decision. Whitlam\u2019s supporters saw him as a martyr to an outmoded constitutional process \u2013 some even as the victim of a CIA plot after he pulled troops out of Vietnam and sought to redefine Australia\u2019s foreign policy as independent from the US and Britain. Despite his reforms, he had been vulnerable to attack thanks to various scandals and miscalculations and a lack of numbers in the Senate. In early 1974 the upper house had rejected 19 government bills and Whitlam looked for ways to increase his supporters in the chamber. Whitlam\u2019s first battle for control of the Senate was to encourage the Queensland Democratic Labor party (formed after a bitter split in Labor in the 1950s) senator Vince Gair to resign in exchange for the plum post as ambassador to Ireland. Whitlam planned to replace him with a Labor senator at the next election for half of the chamber. But in a fateful error he did not secure the resignation before announcing the date of the poll, which meant Gair\u2019s seat could not be contested. The opposition got wise to the oversight and senators inveigled Gair to a quiet area of Parliament House and kept him hidden away from Whitlam\u2019s staff, who were seeking his written resignation, with drink and prawns. In what has gone down in history as the night of the long prawns, Gair, who was party to the fiasco, resigned the next morning when it was too late for Whitlam to engineer to put his own man in the seat. The then opposition leader Billy Snedden called the scheme \u201cthe most shameful act by any government in Australia\u2019s history\u201d. It was according to one Whitlam biographer, \u201cconstitutionally sound, strategically brilliant and an unmitigated political disaster\u201d. A very close general election in May 1974, which he fought with the slogan \u201cGive Gough a fair go\u201d, saw Whitlam re-elected but he still failed to win the all-important majority in the Senate. The shenanigans set in train the constitutional events that eventually led to his dismissal. Later in the year, amid an economic slump, came one of Whitlam\u2019s low points. The so-called loans affair highlighted worries about his financial competence. It concerned discredited and unsuccessful attempts to use a Pakistani financier, Tirath Khemlani, as a go-between to secure US$4bn in loans for infrastructure projects from the Middle East. In the fallout from the storm Whitlam had to sack his deputy prime minister and lost another key minister. In October 1975 the Liberal opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, used his numbers in the Senate to block the government\u2019s budget bills until the prime minister called an election. After three weeks of uncertainty and turmoil Whitlam planned an election involving half the senators to break the deadlock. He went to see the governor general, who rejected the advice and instead dismissed the shocked prime minister from office. Fraser was appointed caretaker prime minister until the poll and Whitlam was resoundingly defeated. Edward Gough Whitlam was born in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. His mother, Martha (n\u00e9e Maddocks), used his middle name to stop schoolmates calling him Eddie. He was encouraged into a lifelong love of literature and history by his father, Frederick, who rose to become Australia\u2019s crown solicitor. He shone at Canberra grammar school and in 1935 entered the University of Sydney, where he studied arts and law. There he met Margaret Dovey. They married in 1942, after Whitlam had enlisted with the Royal Australian Air Force. He finished the second world war as a flight lieutenant navigator, completed his law degree and, in 1947, qualified as a barrister. In a byelection in 1952 he won the safe Labor seat of Werriwa, in south-west Sydney. The Labor party\u2019s roots lay in the shearers\u2019 strikes of the 1890s, which were brutally put down. Its sympathies were with the so-called \u201cbattlers\u201d of society. A bitter split in the party in the 1950s over alleged communist sympathies kept it in the political wilderness until Whitlam\u2019s victory in 1972 caught the mood of change with the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d. His government might have been short-lived but it left an indelible impression on the public imagination. Whitlam\u2019s early reforms included ending conscription, freeing jailed draft resisters, and taking the sales tax off contraceptives. There was a new focus on women, the environment and the arts. In a decision that divided public opinion, he approved the purchase by the National Gallery of Australia of Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles, for US$2m. It is now valued at many millions more. Whitlam made a cameo appearance in the 1974 film Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, playing the prime minister welcoming Barry Humphries, in his alter ego as Edna Everage, back to Sydney. Whitlam ad libbed the words, \u201cArise, Dame Edna\u201d. The title has stuck and, in his book The Whitlam Government (1986), he wrote: \u201cIt was the only imperial honour my government ever conferred.\u201d He increased ties with Asia, recognised China, introduced the health system that later became Medicare, brought in free university tuition and expanded justice for Indigenous Australians by granting land rights. In 1975 at a moving ceremony on Gurindji land he poured a handful of desert sand through the fingers of a Northern Territory traditional owner now recognised in law. Whitlam told him: \u201cVincent Lingiari, I solemnly hand to you these deeds as proof, in Australian law, that these lands belong to the Gurindji people and I put into your hands part of the earth itself as a sign that this land will be the possession of you and your children for ever.\u201d But many found it hard to forgive his role in not standing up more strongly for the East Timorese against the territorial ambitions of the Indonesians when Portugal decolonised. Whitlam told President Suharto in 1974 he would support Indonesia\u2019s annexation of the colony if the Timorese were allowed self-determination. A month after the dismissal the Indonesians invaded and independence did not happen until 1999. Domestically, Whitlam\u2019s progressive achievements were increasingly overshadowed by economic and political mismanagement. The leader who could quote the classics with aplomb was found wanting when it came to financial matters. There were repeated cabinet reshuffles and sackings. The gloss began to wear off and a federal election in 1974 did not resolve the uneven balance of power in the Senate. In 1975 the government seemed to stagger from one debacle to another, culminating in the loans affair. The storm created the circumstances for Fraser to block the budget. The country was in shock and crisis but a month later Whitlam lost the election in a landslide that ushered in a further eight years of conservative rule under Fraser. Whitlam left politics in 1978 after a spell on the backbenches and spent much of the next decade overseas as a visiting professor at Harvard and as Australia\u2019s ambassador to Unesco in Paris. He wrote, read and with his wife took literary and cultural tours around Britain and Europe. In 1985 at an open-air opera in Sydney with Joan Sutherland the Whitlams were given a rousing reception. One reporter remarked \u201cIf there is political royalty in Australia then the emeritus emperor and empress would have to be Gough and Margaret Whitlam.\u201d In 1999 he put aside his differences with Fraser when both campaigned on the losing side in the referendum proposing that Australia become a republic. Whitlam was in many ways ahead of his time, managing in just three years to set an agenda for Australia\u2019s future in terms of foreign relations, social policy and national identity. He earned his place as the country\u2019s foremost elder statesman. He was a great lover of the theatrical. When introduced to Alan Jay Lerner, of the musical writing team Lerner and Loewe, Whitlam joked: \u201cYour Camelot lasted a lot longer than mine.\u201d Margaret died in 2012. Whitlam is survived by three sons and a daughter.
