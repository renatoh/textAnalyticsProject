In his analysis he ignores opinion polling, which shows no growth in support for the monarchy, and he ignores the perilous and imminent succession of King Charles. A YouGov poll commissioned by Republic at the time of Prince Harry\u2019s wedding last year showed widespread indifference to the royals. As expected, a clear majority (60%) said they liked the Queen, but only a third said they liked her \u201ca great deal\u201d. Meanwhile, only 37% wanted Charles to succeed the Queen; 46% said they would prefer \u201csomeone else\u201d. The days after Diana\u2019s death were not a republican moment, but they were a sign of shifting attitudes toward the royals. More than two decades on and the people are losing interest in the royals and deference towards national institutions has evaporated. Meanwhile the republican movement continues to grow and prepare for future success. Graham Smith Chief executive officer, Republic \u2022 Maybe Larry Elliott\u2019s impression that \u201cBritain has always tended to be a conservative country wary of radical change\u201d reflects the questions that have and haven\u2019t been asked. Britain is not one country but several. People in Wales and Scotland voted for a new assembly and a new parliament; and for some in each country, that isn\u2019t enough. Northern Ireland, not part of Britain, currently shares the UK constitution. It is at least conceivable that, if asked soon, a majority there would opt to join the Irish Republic. Unlike citizens of very many countries, UK subjects of its monarchy don\u2019t own our constitution and aren\u2019t offered a chance to change it. But in 2019, even to imagine that the UK constitution might be sorted out by another binary question, monarchy or republic, in another referendum \u2013 words fail me. There\u2019s no knowing what might have been the outcome of a people\u2019s commission on the UK constitution established 20 years ago. It\u2019s unlikely to have been worse than the outcome of ignoring the matter.
