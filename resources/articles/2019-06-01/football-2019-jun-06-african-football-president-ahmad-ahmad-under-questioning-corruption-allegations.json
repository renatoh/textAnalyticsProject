World football\u2019s governing body also suggested its ethics committee has been investigating allegations made against Ahmad. The news website jeuneafrique.com reported on Thursday morning that Ahmad had been escorted from the Berri Hotel by officials from France\u2019s central office for combating corruption and financial and tax crimes (OCLCIFF). Ahmad\u2019s questioning follows widespread reporting in April that CAF\u2019s secretary general, Amr Fahmy, had been sacked after he turned whistleblower and sent Fifa\u2019s ethics committee a document listing allegations of financial irregularities and sexual harassment. Ahmad, who had spent days in Paris before Wednesday\u2019s Fifa congress battling the fallout from the allegations, which he has denied, responded by saying he would set up an internal governance process to deal with them. He and CAF are also embroiled in a crisis over the African Champions League final, which was abandoned and awarded to Tunis Esp\u00e9rance last week after their opponents, Wydad of Casablanca, walked off because the VAR system was not working. Tunis Esp\u00e9rance supporters who live in Paris held passionate demonstrations outside the Hyatt hotel where CAF ultimately decided on Wednesday that the final should be replayed. Fifa re-elected its president, Gianni Infantino, unopposed, by \u201cacclamation\u201d \u2013 a round of applause \u2013 for another four years at the congress, where he promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d of financial wrongdoing after the deluge of corruption scandals. In its statement Fifa said: \u201cFifa has taken note of the alleged events concerning Mr Ahmad Ahmad, who is being questioned by the French authorities in relation to allegations related to his mandate while president of CAF. Fifa is unaware of the details surrounding this investigation and is therefore not in a position to make any comment on it specifically. \u201cFifa is asking the French authorities for any information that might be relevant to the investigations taking place within its ethics committee. As a matter of due process everyone has the right to the presumption of innocence but, as the Fifa president reiterated yesterday, Fifa is fully committed to eradicating all forms of wrongdoing at any level in football. Anyone found to have committed illicit or illegal acts has no place in football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
