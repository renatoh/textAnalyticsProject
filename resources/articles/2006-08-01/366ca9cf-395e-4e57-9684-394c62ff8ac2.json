Unfortunately I'm not sure what that crucial thing is. But I do find it surprising that there is a region of the female body called the underboob - I had previously thought I had a complete mental map of all the female erogenous zones. Until the discovery of underboob, I believe I had worked out the perfect formula for identifying them. It was simple, and it was accurate. It goes thus: everything on a suitable female body is an erogenous zone, apart from the following: ears, armpits (esp. unshaven), nostrils, palms. But to return to the underboob and its implications. The sudden emergence of this hitherto unidentified region of skin has introduced a whole new dimension to the study and categorisation of the erogenous zone. For it appears that the breast has now been 'bitted'. Grand Central Station apparently will happily accept sideboob on to its newsstands, and positively welcome cleavage, that classic old-school erogenous zone, which in fact is not breast at all, but the space between breasts. But underboobs are considered a discrete and separate element to the remainder of the breast. This principle of bitting, if widely adopted, has far-reaching implications. Previously, for example, I, like most of my gender, had eroticised women's lips. Full, pink, moist, slightly parted, they held almost as much promise as the real thing. Now it becomes clear that the concept 'lips' is merely a linguistic construction. One could just as easily 'bit' the lips into underlip, overlip, supralip (the cleft between nose and overlip) and intralip (where the two make contact). How did it all get so complicated? In the beginning there was face, and then, lo, there was cleavage and, in the 19th century, there was ankle and, as hemlines rose, there came legs, and there you had it, your basic staples, your meat and potatoes of male fantasy. But, since the 60s, erogenous zones have been multiplying at a dizzying rate. Yes, there was the odd lacuna of the late 70s in which - if you moved in any kind of remotely left-wing circles - all identifiably erotic female bodily zones were considered an expression of patriarchy and the 'male gaze', and thus abolished. But since then, it has become hard for a man to keep up with the parts of the anatomy by which one is meant to be stimulated. As 70s puritanism wore off, it was Madonna, who almost single-handedly re-erogenised the female body. First the midriff in her 'Holiday' phase, then biceps, as she mutated into a Material Girl, the material in this instance apparently being granite. And finally, in her Blonde Ambition phase, she rediscovered breasts with a remarkable flair for fetishistic corsetry. After Madonna redefined the female body as empowering rather than exploitative, a whole raft of erogina (not a real word, but then neither is underboob) arrived. There was, for instance, the collagen bee sting or 'trout pout', and the lower back suitably decorated by a slinky tattoo, the so-called 'tramp stamp' and, most recently, the upper pubis as revealed by low-slung jeans. There was even a doomed attempt in the early 90s to make the toes erotic - the risibly christened 'toe cleavage'. The emergence of these zones was facilitated by the fashion industry - in the case of the pubis and lower back, the dominance of the thong and low-slung jeans; and, in the case of toes, sandal manufacturers. Recently, sleeves being cropped to the elbow is the latest attempt to eroticise a nominal body zone, although forearm and wrist, as far as I am concerned, are almost toe-like in their inadaptability to this particular purpose. Does this mean it is all out of control? Will it become a free-for-all, where more and more flesh is exposed until only the interior of the labia is taboo? No, because taboo is necessary for the whole show to work. The real erogenous zones, those ones that you only get to see in the privacy of the bedroom or on your internet search engine, will always remain out of view because without them all the other erogenous zones - which to a greater or lesser extent point to, imply or reflect the real naughty bits - will simply vanish. They depend on each other. Thus limits are established and maintained. So in conclusion - we need a return to basics. I propose the launch of a campaign for Real Erotic Zones (REZones). This would involve a kind of British Standard kitemark that would attest to the authenticity of an erogenous zone. Legs and breasts would be shoo-ins. Lips and hair we could talk about. As for underboobs, my instinct is that the judgment will go against them. Why? Because underboobs are an invention of the glamour industry, desperate for new patches of flesh for women to reveal and excite gullible men. Thus the once-simple world of a nicely turned ankle or an elegant shoulder is being turned into a nightmarish kaleidoscope of hot buttons which one can barely even locate any more - let alone press ... \u00b7 Tim Lott is the author of The Seymour Tapes, Penguin, \u00a37.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
