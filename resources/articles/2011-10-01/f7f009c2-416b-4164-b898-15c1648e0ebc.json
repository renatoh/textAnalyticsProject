It is a real statement of intent that the government wants to prevent social problems rather than having to treat them expensively later on. This move \u2013 in the areas of adult social care, early years and criminal reoffending work \u2013 plays to the strengths of the third sector, which is best placed to deliver prevention programmes. The fact that a political consensus has been reached that prevention is the best way forward, means the challenge for the government now is to ensure that the money set aside for prevention gets to the right people at the right time rather than simply being redirected to fund existing ways of doing things. The government must take decisive action or prevention will not be delivered, and won't choke the demand for expensive public services. The most obvious way to ensure successful delivery of prevention programmes is to secure a commitment from NHS boards and local authorities that they will invest in prevention programmes and the third sector, but experience tells us that this doesn't work. Only 18% of the 2011 \u00a370m change fund for care of older people was spent on prevention. If the new change funds are to act as catalysts for the prevention agenda, the government must step in and make sure that local authorities and NHS boards overcome their reluctance to invest upfront in preventative services. Questions are also being asked about where the \u00a3500m of funding for prevention will come from. The draft budget was always going to entail cuts, so it's little surprise that prevention will largely be resourced by the reallocation of existing funds. The key issue here is that just \u00a3260m will come from the Scottish government, with the remaining \u00a3240m to be sourced from local authorities and NHS boards. Ensuring that these funds are released will be one of the biggest obstacles to realising the government's vision for prevention. Alex Neil MSP, cabinet secretary for infrastructure and capital investment, has pledged publicly that lessons will be learned from the failings of the fund for the care of older people and incorporated into the design of a new funding mechanism for other areas. Power and responsibility is an issue here, of which the third sector has little at the moment. We need strong leadership and direction from the government to stop vested interests allowing prevention funds to be swallowed up by acute services or local government structural reforms. It's time for a major cultural shift in the cultural mindset of public authorities and wider public sector organisations \u2013 starting with a move away from institutional protectionism. Another fear is that local authorities and NHS boards will simply re-badge existing acute services as prevention. Unless the third sector is included in decision-making around change fund allocation, there is a real danger that Scotland could miss out on this exciting opportunity to revolutionise public services by supporting genuinely preventative approaches that not only reduce demand for expensive services but produce better outcomes for its people. Putting local authorities or health boards in charge of change funds is akin to putting the fox in charge of the hen house. The Scottish government needs to think differently by allocating a significant part of change fund money directly to the third sector.
