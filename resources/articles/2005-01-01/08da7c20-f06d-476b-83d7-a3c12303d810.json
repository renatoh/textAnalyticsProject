The 19-year-old had also been coveted by Liverpool. Carson is seen by Chelsea as medium-term competition for their current No1 Petr Cech. He is an England Under-21 player but has made only three first-team appearances for Leeds, all in the Premiership last season. Chelsea may end up paying Leeds \u00a31m for Carson, with the extra payments linked to appearances and honours. Liverpool had offered only \u00a3250,000 up front, plus add-ons which could have taken the fee to the same final six-figure sum. Leeds found the Chelsea offer more attractive given their financial predicament, and Carson is keen to work with Cech. He is likely to spend the rest of this season as No3 but the No2 Carlo Cudicini is expected to leave in the summer. David Bentley could have played his last game for Norwich. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder faces up to three months out with a torn medial knee ligament. The 20-year-old has undergone a scan and is set to see a specialist after hobbling out of the FA Cup defeat at West Ham. Norwich's manager Nigel Worthington said: \"It's quite a severe tear of his medial knee ligament. He'll see a specialist today when the picture will become clearer, but it could be anything up to three months.\" If the worst is confirmed, Norwich could reluctantly ask Arsenal if they would be prepared to cancel the England Under-21 international's season-long deal, which would free up a slot in Worthington's injury-hit squad for another loan signing. Norwich, who are third from bottom of the Premiership, have only 15 fit outfield players and so the youngsters Jason Shackell, Danny Crow and Ryan Jarvis are all set to be included again this weekend. Gavin McCann, the Aston Villa midfielder, is facing three months on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery. But the club are confident the operation will \"clear up entirely\" the problem that has dogged McCann this season. A Villa spokesman said: \"Gavin McCann will be out of action for three months, which is longer than was originally thought, but the operation he has had gives him a much better chance of the problem being cleared up entirely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
