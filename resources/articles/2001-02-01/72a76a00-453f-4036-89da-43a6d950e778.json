The advance version of Tony Blair's pre-election speech yesterday suggested he would merely trail Labour's next moves on education and crime, two 10-year plans sketching Labour's programme from now till 2010. But Mr Blair did something more. He dared attempt a task which he has usually ducked in his first four years in office. He offered a vision of what Labour stands for. Of course this was not a lofty lecture in philosophy. It was a campaign event: the time and place took care of that. Just three months away from a probable election day, Mr Blair chose Enfield, site of New Labour's most totemic victory: the May 1997 defeat of Michael Portillo. In that spirit, Mr Blair used the occasion, as so often, to recite a laundry list of Labour achievements since taking power. It may be a tedious tactic but, as the election approaches, it is a necessary one: the government has a good record in key areas - from the improved literacy and numeracy of our 11-year-olds to the creation of the minimum wage - and the prime minister is right to shout about it. What was less predictable was the rest of the address. Mr Blair broke the usual conventions of his trade - which couch such matters in euphemism - to make an explicit admission of his political story so far. He confessed that his first term was \"essentially one of reassurance\", as Labour calmed the nerves of those who had always doubted its ability to govern. In a second term, he promised, Labour would do more than prove its competence, be more than mere technocrats (a tacit admission from the prime minister that this is how his team has too often behaved until now). Labour would set about advancing its ideals - the lowering of the barriers that keep talent and ambition blocked and their replacement with a true meritocracy. It may not sound like much, but it's more substantial than the third way vapidities that have gone before. The Labour leader has at last done more than merely eschew the party's traditional conception of equality; he has offered one of his own - the pursuit of \"real upward mobility\". Mr Blair did not leave that as a mere platitude. His speech yesterday offered a specific policy aimed at creating a meritocracy: the opening up of higher education. Of course there is a ripe charge of hypocrisy here, given that it is Labour's abolition of maintenance grants for low income students which has done so much to keep the badly off away from our universities. But the goal, articulated yesterday, of 50% enrolment in higher education by 2010 is not only laudable, but necessary if Britain is to \"break down the barriers\" that hold its people back. There is something here to cheer Labour's traditional supporters. For when Mr Blair tells pupils from the toughest inner city schools that their \"background shouldn't hold [them] back\", he is speaking about more than education policy. He is attacking privilege and advancing a meritocratic brand of egalitarianism. His is not a Darwinian notion of meritocracy, that awards the the spoils only to \"the fittest\", but one that would allow people a second, third and fourth chance to compete throughout their lives. Government would have a clear role: not standing back, but making sure the race of life is run fairly. It is not perfect; it is not even complete. But the vision Tony Blair sketched yesterday opens up a space for progressives to fill with ideas of their own. It is a tantalising glimpse of what a second Labour term could bring - and why it is still worth fighting for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
