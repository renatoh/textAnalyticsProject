Up to 150 remote Indigenous communities in Western Australia are threatened with closure after an announcement last November that federal funding for them would be allowed to lapse. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices,\u201d Abbott said in March in support of the decision, \u201cif those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.\u201d The UN rapporteur, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, took issue with Abbott\u2019s characterisation of the desire of Indigenous communities to inhabit ancestral grounds as \u201clifestyle choices\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian in New York, she said: \u201cThis whole issue of racist kinds of pronouncements doesn\u2019t really speak well of how governments are supposed to be complying with their human rights obligations. \u201cAt least don\u2019t be saying these kinds of pronouncements. Because it really just complicates the whole issue, and it really shows how uncommitted some governments are in relation to their compliance to human rights instruments.\u201d Tauli-Corpuz said representatives of the Kimberley Land Council, in Western Australia, had met her at the UN to seek her help. Tauli-Corpuz said she had written to the Australian government to ask for more support for remote communities. \u201cThe cutting back of the federal funding for these communities is really worrisome,\u201d Tauli-Corpuz said. \u201cIf they would like to continue staying there, then they should be given that choice. Because it\u2019s their life. To say it\u2019s a lifestyle choice, and they don\u2019t deserve any support from the government \u2026 they are still citizens of Australia.\u201d Tauli-Corpuz, who was appointed last June after five years as chair of the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues, acknowledged that Australia was dealing with a tight budget.But she said the decision to defund remote communities, and Abbott\u2019s characterisation of that decision, were misguided. \u201cI was surprised to hear it,\u201d Tauli-Corpuz said. \u201cI really think that saying that kind of thing and then linking it, and using it as a justification to reduce any federal funding is really an issue ... It also smacks of racism, of course.\u201d Upon taking office in 2013, Abbott declared himself a \u201cprime minister for Aboriginal affairs\u201d, taking on the portfolio directly. Tauli-Corpuz, who as a member of the Kankana-ey Igorot people from the northern Philippines is the first indigenous woman to hold the rapporteur post, said the Australian government had \u201cregressed\u201d in extending aid to Indigenous communities. \u201cFrom what I heard they have really turned \u2013 they have regressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe funds are being cut very drastically. So any kind of support that goes to Aboriginal people has really been decreased, according to the leaders I spoke with. \u201cThey said it has really deteriorated more than what it has been in previous years. That\u2019s what they claim.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
