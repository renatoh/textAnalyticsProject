Robin van Persie issued a strongly-worded statement on Saturday night, in which he condemned Adebayor for leaving him bloodied from a stamp at his face. Yet what angered Van Persie more than what he described as Adebayor's \"malacious\" intent in that action was that the Dutchman had not had a problematic relationship with the Togolese striker during their time together at Arsenal. Adebayor was considered a disruptive influence by some at the Emirates Stadium \u2013 he did not get on with the Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner, in particular \u2013 but Van Persie had a good working relationship, at the very least, with a player whom he often partnered up front. It has emerged that Arsenal's Cameroonian defender Alex Song, who is one of Adebayor's closest friends in football, alleges he was slapped in the face by Adebayor during City's 4-2 victory at Eastlands. Furthermore, Cesc F\u00e1bregas, the Arsenal captain, felt that Adebayor had tried to stamp on him too. There was also a general feeling in the Arsenal changing room that the manner in which Adebayor celebrated his goal in front of the travelling fans had shown, in the words of Van Persie's statement, \"a lack of class\". Van Persie initially declined to comment on the controversy but, after boarding the team bus and feeling his sense of indignation rise, the straight-talking Dutchman decided to unburden himself. He decided to release a statement via the club's official website. It was posted when the squad arrived back in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
