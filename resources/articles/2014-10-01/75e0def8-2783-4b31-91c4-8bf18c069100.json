Keane, who was signed by Ferguson in 1993 from Nottingham Forest, recently stated that he is unsure whether forgiving his former manager will ever be possible following his infamous departure from United in 2005. He also claimed that comments made about him over the years were \u201ca pack of lies\u201d. However, the Aston Villa and Republic of Ireland assistant manager praised Ferguson\u2019s managerial qualities on Monday night, during a question-and-answer session in London to promote his new autobiography, The Second Half. \u201cTwelve and a half years, to work under one manager. I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m bitter and twisted towards Alex Ferguson, but I\u2019m obviously going to say I\u2019m disappointed with his comments, what he said about me,\u201d said Keane. \u201cI\u2019m not for one minute playing down what he achieved. Absolutely amazing. \u201cI played under good managers, bad managers. The top managers get a feel for the group, they know what you need. Whatever Alex Ferguson\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, that was by far his biggest strength. \u201cMe and Alex Ferguson, we had the same type of traits, of what Manchester United was about. I think that probably created the problems towards to the end. We almost knew we were coming to the end.\u201d Keane, whose United career ended following a controversial interview with the in-house TV station MUTV, recounted one particular pre-match team-talk which reflected Ferguson\u2019s ability to read the mindset of his players. \u201cI thought I knew what the group might need, that we didn\u2019t need a big team talk,\u201d said Keane. \u201cIt was Tottenham at home. I thought please don\u2019t go on about Tottenham, we all know what Tottenham is about, they are nice and tidy but we\u2019ll fucking do them. He came in and said: \u2018Lads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u2019, and that was it. Brilliant.\u201d Keane continued: \u201cIt could have been a European semi-final, it could have been Leeds away, it could have been a home League Cup tie \u2013 Alex Ferguson always had a feel of the group.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
