Everton announced an extension to the club's shirt sponsorship deal with Thai brewing company Chang on Thursday that could be worth \u00a316m-plus over the next three seasons. The deal is the most lucrative in Everton's history yet pales in comparison with the terms negotiated by Arsenal (\u00a330m per year), Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City (all \u00a320m per year) and Tottenham Hotspur's \u00a319m a season from their shirt sponsors. It places Everton, who confirmed the new agreement in Bangkok, in a similar sponsorship bracket to Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Sunderland and bottom-of-the-table Fulham. Mart\u00ednez, however, insists it would take more than a lucrative sponsorship deal to close the financial gap on Chelsea and Manchester City, and has been reassured that money raised will be invested in his squad. Asked if he thought the Chang deal was the best a club of Everton's size could attract, he said: \"The way I assess it is it's much bigger than we've had in the past so we are making progress and we are getting more finance from the same source. \"We're going to continue trying to get the best we can from our resources and I have to find a way for us to be as competitive as we can with the resources we have. Nowadays, if you want to challenge Man City or Chelsea financially it's not going to come down to getting a good (sponsorship) deal or not, it's a lot more than that because the disparity in finances is huge. So I'm not too worried about that. \"The board has been very supportive, the chairman has been very supportive and he's allowed me to manage the football club in a way that means everything we produce can be reinvested. That's all I want. It's not about the number, it's what you can do with the finances that come in. Sometimes you're in a position where you need to meet payments and you can't reinvest in the squad; that's not the case at Everton. Whatever comes in can be reinvested in the squad.\" Mart\u00ednez has exploited the loan market in his debut season as Everton manager and cited that, plus the club's productive youth academy, as ways of keeping the club competitive at the top of the Premier League. \"There's no good feeling inferior to others if you haven't got the same finances as them,\" the Everton manager added. \"You take what you've got in football and take the most from it. That's why you look at the loan market and you look to youngsters. If you asked me would I like to have more finances, of course, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee you success. \"We need to find a way to challenge and I think the youth we've got in this squad, as long as we keep it and keep developing it, is going to be the unknown quantity that will allow us to challenge the other sides who've got bigger finances. I don't think lack of finances will stop us from challenging the top four. There is a way with the quality we've got at the club to bridge that gap but a lot is going to come down to how well we can do in the next 10 games because there's a point when you have to master what you're good at. \"The game against Cardiff was very satisfying from that point of view because we never stopped doing the right things, we were very stubborn in the way we played and we got our rewards in the 92nd minute because we were so good in what we were trying to do. If we can do that over 38 games then I do feel that we can bridge that gap.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
