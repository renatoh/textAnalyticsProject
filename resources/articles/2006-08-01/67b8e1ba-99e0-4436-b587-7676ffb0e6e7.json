These days, when so many withdrawals and deposits take place on the web, customers can go months without seeing the inside of their branch. But they are still entitled to think that the thickness of the steel and concrete that once protected their records and savings is reproduced in cyberspace. Customers of HSBC will not be the only ones concerned to read in today's Guardian that the bank's internet arm uses inadequate techniques to protect online personal accounts from fraud. HSBC is one of the largest retail banks in the UK, and has more than 100 million customers around the world - so it is a surprise that a readily available tool can enable hackers to break into those online accounts. If HSBC can be found to be wanting, others are justified in wondering if their own banks or credit-card providers are equally remiss. The good news is that most British banks and building societies have tighter online security arrangements. It is also some relief for HSBC's customers that the bank is examining the method of attack - although they may note with chagrin that HSBC's business customers are given stronger online protection and so are not vulnerable. But it is still a worthwhile reminder that internet security scares did not disappear along with the hoopla of the early dotcom era. Already this week the US internet service provider AOL has admitted publishing vast amounts of data identifying individuals. Events such as these hold back the internet by making potential customers wary about fraud. Despite its rapid adoption, use of the internet is still in its infancy. People who scrupulously bolt every window persist in using their favourite football team or pet's name as their password. Even worse, too many are happy to use \"password\". Just as no one would leave money in a bank with no locks, so buyers and clients need to beware. That does not absolve corporations of their responsibilities for security in internet transactions, but the nature of the internet - including the unwitting spread of viruses by naive emailers - places some responsibility on individual users. In its defence, HSBC said the particular defect identified by Cardiff University \"is not one that we have seen criminals use\", and that its overall record is better than most. That is not entirely reassuring. Even if the flaw has never been exploited, the bank should be grateful to the researchers who uncovered it - on the grounds that if they found it then the danger of criminals doing the same is always there. \u00b7 September 21, letters: Dyfrig John, Chief Executive of HSBC Bank: Security is strong for online banking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
