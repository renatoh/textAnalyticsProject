Weather reports, however, suggest she was born during a warm, pleasant shower. Her life was often shrouded in mystery and half-truths. It does seem probable, though, that after her tour of British theatres in 1975, Davis took time out to trace her relatives, and some people say she found them. Susan George investigates in Bette in Britain (11.30am, Radio 4), with the help of actor Wendy Craig and broadcaster Wyn Calvin, who met Davis in Cardiff. The Afternoon Play (2.15pm, Radio 4), meanwhile, is revisiting the case of Dr Crippen, and the man who helped to get him hanged for murder: Sir Bernard Spilsbury. When human remains were found in the cellar of Crippen's house in 1910, there was little to go on. Most of the body had been burned or dissolved in acid; no one could even tell if it belonged to a man or woman. But Spilsbury proved the corpse was that of Crippen's wife, Cora. The Incomparable Witness stars Timothy Watson and Honeysuckle Weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
