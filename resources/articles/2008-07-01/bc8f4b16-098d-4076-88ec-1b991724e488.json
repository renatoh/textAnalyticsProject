In this movie, where the nothingness is utterly exasperating, a pair of directionless strangers in their mid-20s, Jamie (Erin Fisher) and Charlie (Chris Lankenau), meet, hang out and nap. He is the kind of nice but quiet guy no one can think of anything to say to at a party, while she is perky and perfectly pleasant. Neither says anything that wouldn't sound boring if you overheard them talking on a bus, although New York - Brooklyn, of course - looks absolutely captivating through the lens of yet another director falling for the city."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
