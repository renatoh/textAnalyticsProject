Last night Conservative MPs turned the election for the executive of the backbench 1922 committee into a vehicle for their differences over what the party should be saying to voters. The result was inconclusive: the Cameron-baiting old guard were not trounced and nor was the 301 group of modernisers sent away with a bloody nose. The real question, about what Conservatives are for if they cannot manage the economy successfully remains unresolved. This matters to non-Conservatives too: the politics of extremes serves no one's interests. David Cameron knew there were irreconcilable backbenchers likely to cause trouble in the course of the parliament: early on he tried to capture the 1922 by allowing ministers to vote in its internal elections. Having, reluctantly, abandoned the changes, the slate put forward this time by the loyalist 301 group was widely seen as another attempt to subvert the committee's independence. Excessive zeal in party management is never an attractive quality, but the Westminster bickering of an internal organisation is much less significant than the problem that it represents \u2013 constructing a viable platform amid the ruins of an economic policy on which the entire five-year programme of government had been predicated. For instead of going into the next election with a growing economy, more jobs and lower taxes, George Osborne has already conceded that there will probably be at least two more years of cuts to come. The past month in European politics makes plain how divisive the political consequences might be. No Tory backbencher is (yet) publicly questioning the austerity strategy. Nor, the polls suggest, do a majority of voters. In fact, despite Tory MPs' criticism of the budget shambles, voters still trust the coalition more than Labour on the economy. The question that really divides the party is whether in the face of austerity it returns to an enhanced core-vote strategy of shoring up the right flank from Ukip by focusing on the traditional crime, immigration and Europe agenda, or whether to keep faith, despite the vastly altered circumstances, in Cameron's modernising programme and anchor the party to the centre-right. At stake is not just the slender majorities of the 40 group (the proliferation of Tory backbench groups is surely a reflection of the uncertainty about political direction), nor surviving the cull of seats as the number of MPs is cut, but the tone of British politics. The omens are mixed. The best indication of current team Cameron thinking is in the parting shot of his California-bound blue-skies thinker, Steve Hilton. Mr Hilton's frustration with the constraints of working at the centre of the Whitehall web has been well documented. In particular he despaired of the deregulation programme. Now the man who once mused on abolishing maternity benefit has left behind what is described as a well-developed plan for another swingeing round of welfare cuts with up to \u00a325bn more taken from in-work benefits. It is a further sign of the shifting positions in the party that the welfare secretary Iain Duncan Smith has reportedly dismissed the idea as \"absolute nonsense\". But \u2013 and this is something Labour must contend with \u2013 party strategists calculate welfare cuts to be popular, at least if accompanied by a reputation for economic competence. And although they would like to play down the old nasty party's obsessions with Europe and immigration, and focus on jobs and the cost of living, there is no mistaking the pressure to appeal to an increasingly anxious electorate with a more divisive attack on the poor and workless. Strong and fair is one dubious slogan under which they would like to fight the next election. Meanwhile Mr Cameron's increasingly noisy critics on the right worry that the prime minister has no stomach for fight at all. They see a Baldwinian inertia at the heart of government. That might yet mean that the loudest voice the voters hear is in the shrill tones of a populist right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
