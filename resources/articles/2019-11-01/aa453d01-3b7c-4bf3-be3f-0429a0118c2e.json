Asked if he is excited that Sunday\u2019s match between Liverpool and Manchester City may feature as many as half a dozen players eligible for the national team, his reply does not serve to further the hype. \u201cWell, it used to be double that,\u201d Southgate says with a wry smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably a bigger sign of the times, that we won\u2019t have half the players on the field eligible for us. Then we have to pick up the pieces of that game. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty from our perspective but those that are playing are of good quality and, of course, it\u2019s a huge game for all of them.\u201d Southgate, who is preparing for the final two Euro 2020 qualifiers, is getting tired of the sound of his own voice when it comes to the subject of eligibility. He has been sharing the shocking statistics about the shortage of English players in the top flight for a year now. It was at 33% of the total then, dropped to 30% in the summer and has bounced back slightly this year, but only just and largely because of Chelsea, who are operating under a transfer embargo. \u201cThere\u2019s almost half the league in this last couple of months that we haven\u2019t watched because the reality is they don\u2019t have any English players, or they\u2019re not at the level,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cWe\u2019re a few per cent higher this year, which is a positive step. You can see even by that small shift that we have two or three players we are picking now that we wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to pick last season. I think I\u2019ve said enough about eligibility issues and the numbers, but the reality is still different from that of the last few decades.\u201d Which brings us back to the big game. Included in Southgate\u2019s expanded squad of 27 for the matches against Montenegro at Wembley \u2013 the 1,000th England men\u2019s international, which could seal qualification \u2013 then Kosovo away, are John Stones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Left out are Michael Keane and Dele Alli. The latter pair have been scratching for form and, in Alli\u2019s case, recuperating from injury, too. But that argument can apply equally to the players who have made the cut. One distinction, clearly, is that Stones and Oxlade-Chamberlain play for the Premier League\u2019s two standout sides. That said, Southgate has proved he is not someone in thrall to the big clubs and Tyrone Mings is still a more likely starter against Montenegro than Stones. The manager is also clear about many of the criteria he uses for selection, with form playing a key part. Stones embarrassed himself in England\u2019s Nations League defeat by the Netherlands this summer and Oxlade-Chamberlain has started only two league games for Liverpool this season after recovering from multiple ligament damage. So competing at the top end of the table counts for something. \u201cIn the ideal scenario you want players that are playing in matches where they\u2019re pushing to win trophies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe extra pressure that comes with those games is what you have to deal with [when you are] with England. When you\u2019re playing for big clubs, there\u2019s a responsibility to perform every week. With lesser clubs, sometimes you can lose and there isn\u2019t a big inquest. \u201cOf course there is one within the club and locally but with the big clubs that\u2019s national. The profile is just bigger and it\u2019s closer to what they face with the national team.\u201d Southgate is trying to get the right mix of tactics, personnel and mentality. One person who does know what it takes is Southgate\u2019s old mentor and guest at Wembley, Terry Venables. As his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 points out, Venables remains responsible for England\u2019s sole noteworthy European Championship performance, at Euro 96, his excellence another reminder that success is not easy to imitate. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve had some great nights in the last few years but [Venables] was a brilliant manager for me. Great tactical knowledge, great man-management, he developed a fantastic spirit with the group. Our record isn\u2019t illustrious but he delivered one of our best European Championship performances. He was brilliant to work with and inspired me in terms of coaching. I saw the level he was at, having managed England and Barcelona, you knew the level of detail he would go to. I thought he was very forward-thinking and a really impressive guy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
