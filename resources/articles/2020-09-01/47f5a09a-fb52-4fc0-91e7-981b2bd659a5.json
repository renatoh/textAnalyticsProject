Trump announced 20 names on Wednesday that he said would be added to his previously released list of potential supreme court picks. He said one of three conservative Republican senators with law degrees \u2013 Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2013 could be his next selection to the nation\u2019s top court. \u201cOver the next four years, America\u2019s president will choose hundreds of federal judges\u201d and \u201cup to four supreme court justices\u201d, Trump said \u2013 both probably exaggerated figures. The new justices could \u201cfundamentally transform America without a single vote in Congress\u201d, Trump said. Progressive groups quickly criticized the announcement. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing this president doesn\u2019t lie about, it\u2019s his eagerness to stack the courts with extremists prepared to carry out Republicans\u2019 conservative agenda, overturning access to health care and abortion,\u201d Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, said. \u201cThis is a last-ditch effort by the president to energize his base. Trump is clearly trying to distract the American public from an astonishing number of damning allegations right now.\u201d Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way, said: \u201cAt a time when Donald Trump\u2019s judges and justices are already posing an existential threat to healthcare and coverage for pre-existing conditions, his updated list of potential supreme court nominees is yet another emergency alarm making clear the extremely high stakes of this election.\u201d He added: \u201cThis list is packed with far-right ideologues, many of whom have already racked up deeply troubling records on lower courts.\u201d Conservative judicial activist groups, however, greeted the new list of names with cheers. \u201cPresident Trump continues to keep his promise to prioritize the appointment of judges while Joe Biden continues to duck the issue and hide his list,\u201d Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, said. Hawley ruled himself out of the running to be a potential nominee, tweeting he had \u201cno interest in the high court\u201d. Cruz appeared to also rule himself out, saying it was \u201chumbling and an immense honor\u201d to be included on Trump\u2019s list but indicating he would remain in the Senate for the time being. Cotton, however, seemed more interested, saying he would always \u201cheed the call for service\u201d, and tweeting: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Roe v Wade to go.\u201d Trump said Biden, his Democratic opponent in the presidential race, \u201cmust release a list of justices for people to make a decision as to how they should properly vote\u201d. But the practice of releasing lists of names of judges is unique to Trump, who did so in his first presidential run to reassure so-called \u201cvalues voters\u201d that he was safe to support. Trump has elevated an unprecedented number of attorneys to the federal bench who have had no previous experience as judges, but the inclusion on Wednesday of three senators in his list of supreme court picks was seen as a boisterously political move. \u201cIs this supposed to win over swing voters?\u201d tweeted the former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg. \u201cTrump thinks he is still running for the Republication nomination.\u201d Questions about coronavirus revelation Trump\u2019s news conference at the White House to announce his list, designed to shore up evangelical Christian and conservative support for his re-election bid, quickly turned into a back-and-forth with reporters about his coronavirus policy. Damaging revelations emerged with the publication of advance excerpts of a new book by the Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward on Wednesday. Woodward writes that Trump knew in February, a month before the widespread Covid-19 outbreak in the United States, that coronavirus was a lethal threat and that he intentionally \u201cdownplayed\u201d it. Trump is trailing by double-digit margins in national polling averages and some polls have shown him losing support among the base of white evangelical Christians who helped propel him to victory in 2016. Trump warned those voters on Wednesday that life in America would change for good if he was not re-elected, playing on fears that a Democratic president would appoint justices committed to \u201crepealing the second amendment\u201d, \u201cfunding late-term abortion\u201d and removing \u201cthe words \u2018under God\u2019 from the constitution\u201d. Trump also warned that a Democratic president would install judges who would \u201ccripple police departments\u201d and empower \u201crioters, looters anarchists and terrorists\u201d. Neither of the two supreme court justices nominated during Biden\u2019s eight years as vice-president have made any such moves, and decades of public statements and officials votes by Biden have indicated no such intention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
