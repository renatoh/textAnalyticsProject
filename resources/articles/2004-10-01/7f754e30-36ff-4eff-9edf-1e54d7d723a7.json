Come on, you Wales! This is not merely to be a contrarian, more to try to inject some life into what promises to be a predictable qualifying competition. If Wales were to win or draw, everything would be up for grabs. If England were to win, they would be clear and coasting. 'The Road To Germany', as this series of matches has inevitably been dubbed, would be long and obvious. Austria at home with qualification already assured, anyone? Or how about Poland four days later with qualification even more assured, anyone? 'Two for the price of one... A fiver the pair...' Who'd be a tout? The BBC fielded an Englishman, a Scotsman and a Welshman in the studio and Gary Lineker, having noted this fact, sensibly refrained from following up with a joke. The Englishman, oddly, was Alan Shearer, who need not detain us. The Scotsman, inevitably, was Alan Hansen. And the Welshman, entertainingly, was Robbie Savage, who turned out to have made a financially astute move by having himself sent off against Northern Ireland, because surely the BBC pay their pundits more than the \u00a3300 fee plus \u00a3100 win bonus that was on offer for the Wales players performing on the pitch, rather than in the studio. In sum, the Englishman and the Scotsman thought England would win and the Welshman thought Wales would win. 'Things must be going well if Alan Hansen says England are playing well,' said Shearer, who then patted Hansen's right thigh in some form of masonic signal to denote he was telling a joke. Lapdog Savage duly laughed. Even in a bare half-hour of build-up, there was room for not one but two Garth Crooks interviews. 'What will it be like to walk out of the Old Trafford tunnel in an England shirt?' asked Garth Crooks, ponderously and with an emphasis more suited to speaking to young children. 'Just like any other game,' said Rio Ferdinand. 'It must be your biggest game in a Welsh shirt,' asked Crooks. Although admittedly I paraphrase because I popped out to make a cup of coffee halfway through the question, returning from the kitchen easily in time to hear the reply. 'I wouldn't say so,' said Ryan Giggs. Barristers strive not to ask questions to which they don't know the answer; fortunately for any putative clients and the speed of British justice, Crooks is no barrister. John Motson opened his commentary with the exciting news that 'I've got a new co-commentator'. It was Graeme Le Saux. And his first word was 'unbelievable'. He must lead a life full of surprises, because the news that a Wales central defender had injured himself in the warm-up didn't stretch one's credulity too much. Anxious to impress his new co-commentator, Motty, probably mistakenly, decided to see the match as a school reunion. 'Three keen goal collectors in the front row of the England class,' he said. 'Nicky Butt is back in the form room.' On he stormed with his analogy: 'Ryan Giggs had to check he went into the right classroom.' It could have been a trailer for Grange Hill. 'We seem to have been waiting for this match for an awful long time,' said Motty after a five-out-of-10 silence for Kenneth Bigley. And, within four minutes of the start: 'Sven's on his feet.' After which the game drifted into a lull from which it took more than an hour to escape. 'There we were thinking it was all going to be muck and bullets, but it hasn't quite turned out like that.' Muck and bullets? Motty was finding his stride. Minutes later Wales were 'smothering the ball away' and 'there was an unorthodox save by a fallen goalkeeper'. He is always at his best when he throws away the prepared script. In the tunnel at half-time Crooks buttonholed Bryan Robson. 'Hartson, Bellamy, Speed,' he said and if he had gone on through the entire team we would have rejoined the match in the 80th minute. The second half had its moments, notably when, in another trailer for Grange Hill , 'the Welsh defence completely lost their geography'. A Mottyism that should henceforth replace the rather tired 'lost the plot'. As in: 'I'm not sure what came over me. I completely lost my geography.' Then Beckham, who as Le Saux correctly pointed out hadn't been playing very well, played very well indeed for a second. 'Oh, what a joy to see Beckham produce a moment like that. It's like Greece all over again.' Not quite. Then England secured their World Cup place in the final minutes. This time they have practically done so with more than a year to go.
