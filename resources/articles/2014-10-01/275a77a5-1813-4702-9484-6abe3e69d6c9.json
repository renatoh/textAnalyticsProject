The Chelsea manager is notorious for upsetting opposing managers yet Van Gaal is clear the man who was his protege when the Dutchman was in charge of Barcelona from 1997-2000 can never upset him. \u201cMaybe now you know that I am always a controversial person and a lot of media has written about that,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cI\u2019m [made] from a little bit of iron \u2013 so [I have] a shield, an iron shield.\u201d Pressed if anything can penetrate this armoury, Van Gaal said: \u201cNo. Because I think everybody can write or speak about me \u2013 I cannot change that. It took me a long time to understand that but I cannot change what you are writing about me. So I have learnt not to react and believe in myself, my players, my staff and that is important.\u201d Van Gaal offered a picture of a more tender Mourinho than is familiar from his public persona. \u201cWe hardly speak to each other [at the moment]. Sometimes we SMS but when we see each other we feel the warmth between us and our families so that\u2019s nice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a very modest and emotional human being.\u201d Regarding whether V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, the former Barcelona goalkeeper who is training at United, might be offered a contract Van Gaal said: \u201cManchester United always has their eyes open.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
