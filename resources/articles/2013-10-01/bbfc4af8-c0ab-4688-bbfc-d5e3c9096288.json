Australia Day is 26 January, a date whose only significance is to mark the coming to Australia of the white people in 1788. It's not a date that is particularly pleasing for Aborigines. The British were armed to the teeth and from the moment they stepped foot on our country, the slaughter and dispossession of Aborigines began. It is one thing to acknowledge the fact of invasion; it is quite another to celebrate it. Australia reveres its fallen warriors at Gallipoli nearly 100 years ago with monuments and public holidays, and prime ministers attend funerals of each digger killed in Afghanistan. Yet Australian history is blind to the massacres of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of Aborigines massacred in the quest for our lands. There are no monuments and no holidays for the fallen victims of the coming of the whites. Callously, Australia chooses to celebrate its national day in complete disregard to ethnic cleansing and genocide. And then I am asked to participate in the celebrations by accepting an award. National days usually mark the birthing of nationhood, which in Australia\u2019s case was 1901. It is understandable this date is avoided because the original Constitution declared that Aborigines were not to be counted as citizens, and therefore denied the vote among other rights. Australia is the only country that relies on the arrival of Europeans on its shores as being so significant it should herald the official national day. The USA does not choose the arrival of Christopher Columbus as the date for its national day. Like many other countries its national day marks independence. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised in 2007 to the victims of the stolen generations but refused to compensate the victims for the harm suffered. Australia has not once apologised, and meant it, for the invasion of Aboriginal lands. There has been no acknowledgement of the massacres that remain hidden under a \"pioneers\" version of Australian history. There is no effort to genuinely undo the wrongs that still affect Aboriginal people today. Parliaments that acknowledge the traditional owners do so mechanically, without sincerity. I believe that it is unprincipled to participate in Australia Day celebrations while they remain race-based and if I did accept the award I would be seen as abandoning the struggle of my people. Not all Aborigines adopt my position and some have accepted these awards, arguing that recognition of their individual efforts is recognition of the Aboriginal struggle. Their views are genuinely held, but their acceptance of these awards have not made the slightest difference. It seems the more Aborigines play ball the more we legitimise the right of whites to govern, and the right of Aborigines to be governed. Would Palestinians accept an Israeli of the Year award? In my opinion, any person \u2013 not just Aboriginals \u2013 who accepts these nominations without condemnation of the essence of Australia Day celebrations, lacks a social conscience. Those participating in Australia Day ceremonies and awards have an opportunity to call for a change of date for national celebrations. They rarely do. There may come a time when it is legitimate for Aborigines to accept these nominations \u2013 when a treaty has been made between Aborigines and Australia to include a land settlement, designated seats in the parliament and our own assembly. The make-up of parliaments should reflect the people they govern. The 548,370 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders living in urban settings could choose to vote for the Aboriginal Assembly or vote in the electorate within which they reside. Non-Aborigines living on Aboriginal lands could do the same thing, potentially overcoming an image of an ethnic electorate. The date of the agreement could mark a new national date for celebration, where both peoples acknowledge each other's rights and aspirations, thus avoiding the current \"whites only\" celebrations. Until that day, while I am grateful for the thoughts behind my nomination, I would be a hypocrite to accept it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
