South Carolina was the first state to secede from the union over the issue, in December 1860, and the first shots of the war were fired in the state in April the following year. \u201cRoof\u2019s actions,\u201d said the Atlantic writer Adam Serwer, \u201cwere completely consistent with the cause of that flag and all the \u2018service, sacrifice and heritage\u2019 associated with it. The Confederate flag represents treason in defence of human bondage and white supremacy, it always has, and always will.\u201d Roof\u2019s manifesto and pictures of him posing with the flag were revealed on a website after the shooting at Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston on 17 June 2015. As the Guardian reported at the time: \u201cUnder a section entitled \u2018An Explanation\u2019, the website appears to allude to the forthcoming massacre. \u201c\u2018I have no choice,\u2019 it states. \u2018I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is [the] most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.\u2019\u201d The website also contained \u201cwhat appears to be a manifesto filled with racist diatribe about blacks, Jews and Hispanics\u201d. Haley, a Republican and Donald Trump\u2019s first ambassador to the United Nations, was speaking to Glenn Beck, host of the rightwing website and podcast The Blaze. Haley has released a book, With All Due Respect, and has been widely touted as either a replacement for the Vice-President Mike Pence on the 2020 ticket or a Republican presidential candidate herself. Her conversation with Beck was due to be broadcast in full on Saturday. \u201cSouth Carolina fell to our knees when this happened,\u201d Haley told Beck. \u201cThis is one of the oldest African American churches. These \u2026 people were amazing people, they loved their church, they loved their family, they loved their community. \u201cAnd here is this guy that comes out with this manifesto, holding the Confederate flag, and had just hijacked everything that people thought of. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hateful people in South Carolina,\u201d Haley claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s always the small minority that\u2019s always gonna be there but people saw [the flag] as service and sacrifice and heritage, but once he did that there was no way to overcome it.\u201d At the time of the Charleston shooting, Beck himself said flying \u201cthe Confederate flag makes no sense whatsoever\u201d and there were \u201cno ifs, and, or buts\u201d that slavery was the central issue of the civil war. Haley was defended by Bakari Sellers, an African American Democratic politician from South Carolina, who wrote that though \u201cTwitter will hate me for this. I know Nikki Haley and believe she misspoke. She knows the pain associated with the flag.\u201d But Haley makes similar claims in her book, saying Roof \u201crobbed the good-intentioned South Carolinians who supported the flag of this symbol of heritage and service\u201d and saying she \u201cworried that allowing the killer to define what the flag represented for everyone was a surrender\u201d. Haley eventually presided over the removal of the flag from the South Carolina capitol, after protests and attempts to tear it down. On Friday, Levin said she should not \u201cpush this painful history under the rug for political purposes. In the end, you did the right thing by calling for the removal of the flag in 2015, but this dishonours the memory of the Charleston Nine.\u201d Haley also told Beck she resisted the politicisation of the shooting. \u201cThe national media came in droves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to define what happened, they wanted to make this about racism, they wanted to make it about gun control, they wanted to make it about [the] death penalty. \u201cAnd I really pushed off the national media and said: \u2018There will be a time and place where we talk about this but it is not now, we\u2019re gonna get through the funerals, we\u2019re gonna respect them and then we will have that conversation.\u2019 \u201cAnd we had a really tough few weeks of debate but we didn\u2019t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\u2019t have protests, we had hugs. And the people of South Carolina stepped up and showed the world what it is to have grace and strength in the eyes of tragedy.\u201d In a tweet on Friday, Haley linked to a transcript of her remarks on the flag in 2015 and said it \u201cwas a painful time for our state. The pain was and is still real. Below was my call for the removal of the Confederate flag &amp; I stand by it. I continue to be proud of the people of SC and how we turned the hate of a killer into the love for each other.\u201d She also retweeted defences of her remarks to Beck. Roof remains in prison, having been sentenced to death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
