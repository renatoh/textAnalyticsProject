City\u2019s manager denied there was any disciplinary problem with Mendy but said: \u201cHe arrived late, and that shouldn\u2019t happen but it does sometimes. He should be here on time and he knows it. I spoke with him but it is not a problem with his physical condition. I expect him back when he\u2019s fit, which should be quite soon.\u201d Mendy, who has a foot injury, had permission to attend the boxing, Guardiola said. \u201cThere was no problem with him going to watch the fight. Boxing is so important in England. In Spain nobody cares.\u201d Guardiola has confirmed Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s recovery from a knee ligament injury is on schedule, with the midfielder expected to resume training in the next week or so. \u201cEverything is going well,\u201d the Manchester City manager said. \u201cKevin is making the last steps now so we hope to see him back soon.\u201d The original prognosis was that De Bruyne would be out until late October or early November, so there is a chance he could feature in some of his side\u2019s Champions League fixtures before Christmas. Guardiola has praised Raheem Sterling\u2019s start to the season, claiming the winger is growing more self-assured. \u201cI think his performance levels are higher than last season and my feeling is that he is a more mature player now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong but it seems to me he believes in himself more, he is taking on more responsibility. Raheem has a lot of courage, he\u2019s aggressive when he gets the ball. That\u2019s good, in my opinion. Our target is always to try to help players become better than they were last season.\u201d City themselves travel to Liverpool early next month, and with Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side setting the pace at the top of the Premier League it is possible the Anfield fixture will loom larger in players\u2019 minds than the next two games against Brighton and Hoffenheim. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, we try to stay in the present,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe best way to prepare for the Liverpool game is to play well in the two matches that come first.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
