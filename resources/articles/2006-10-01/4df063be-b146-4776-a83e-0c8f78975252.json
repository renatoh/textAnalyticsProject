God forbid", "bodyText": "What a relief that Tory MP Gregory Barker and his wife, Celeste, have chosen not to turn their present conjugal difficulties into a public catfight (he left her, you'll recall, for their male interior decorator). A relief - and a surprise. These days, everyone of note seems keen on asking members of the public to take sides on issues ranging from an acrimonious divorce to a controversial adoption. Who cares about what the court finds or the judge rules when you've won the public over to your camp? We are used to politicians trying to court our support. President Bush has just delivered a speech in which he tried to win over the American people to the increasingly unpopular Iraq war. It's hard, it's awful, he confessed, but someone's gotta do it. It was a typical political attempt at external validation: convince the public of the need to put up with an unpopular war (or tax or austerity measure) and you can get away with murder. What was once a political expedient has become the way of all public rows. Madonna was fed up with the media handling of her adoption of a Malawian orphan, so she appeared on The Oprah Winfrey show last Wednesday and appealed directly to the viewers. Let the court rule that the adoption is illegal; let David's natural father claim he never knew the diva was going to adopt his child. Madonna may lose the battle (and her orphan), but she will have won the war by securing her new reputation as a global do-gooder. A similar need for external validation has obviously exercised Paul and Heather McCartney. They seem more interested in winning over the public to their camp than obtaining a fair settlement. Heather has allegedly leaked a dossier of horrific accusations against her husband; Paul has lined up chums such as the Bills (Clinton and Gates) to testify that he's an icon. Briefings and counter-briefings are being conducted by 'friends' and PR spinners, all in the hope of seizing, if not the moral high ground, then the lion's share of popular support. It seems to have escaped the squabbling duo that what the public thinks cannot affect custody or alimony; this is a battle for hearts and minds, for cheers and jeers, waged because both McCartneys see their future in the public arena. To be unpopular is to be unsellable, either as singer or as an ambassador of a good cause. Joe Public loves it: how flattering to be asked to adjudicate in these megastars' private lives. But this new approach introduces a new relativism: you are only as good or bad as public opinion rules. It was bad enough to know this existed in politics; now that it has seeped into other areas as well, we really do look morally bankrupt. Clare buoyant In politics as in real life, every party needs a flash of colour, a touch of fun. The Tories boast Boris Johnson, the accident-prone, Latin-quoting Lothario MP for Henley. Labour had it with Mo Mowlam and Clare Short, two fiery individuals who liked to tell it how it is. Mo died of cancer last year and Clare has now decided to stand down as MP for Birmingham Ladywood. I bumped into Clare at a Private Eye lunch the other day and she looked blooming: slimmer, glossier and happier than I had ever seen her. Was her happiness down to the prospect of a life free of an MP's duties or to her love life (she is supposedly in a relationship with Jon Norton, Mo's widower)? The latter, she admitted, with a schoolgirl's blush and smile. Public life would be infinitely more drab without her, I assured her. 'Oh, I think I have one more big job in me,' she replied, leaving me to hope that a charity or NGO will soon unveil a new weapon of mass appeal - Clare Short."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
