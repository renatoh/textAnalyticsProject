However, by the second half, the US adjusted and the gap in talent proved to be too much. This US team had a second gear when things became dicey, Japan did not. This game was not the cakewalk that the 110-64 final score would suggest it was, but by the end the US team clearly showed why they\u2019re the heavy favorites. And that will do it for our live coverage of USA women\u2019s basketball, but the Guardian will continue to have literal around-the-clock coverage of the Olympics until the closing ceremonies. Thanks to everyone for reading. Ciao! The US women\u2019s basketball team has defeated Japan in the quarterfinals. They move on to Thursday\u2019s semifinals where they will face the winner of tonight\u2019s game between French and Canada. USA 110-64, FINAL Whalen hits two more jumpers before the final buzzer and that\u2019s a wrap. The US has beaten Japan in the quarterfinals! USA 106-64, 2:46, 4th quarter Tamika Catchings with yet another 3 pointer for the US. USA 103-64, 3:39, 4th quarter Japan take one more timeout. Machida makes a jumper. If there was a fifth or sixth quarter, I\u2019d say that would be a good start for a comeback. But that\u2019s not how quarters work by definition. Fowles makes a layup. USA 101-62, 4:22, 4th quarter And once again the US has broken the 100 point mark after a layup from Whalen and jumper from Augustus. USA 97-62, 5:20, 4th quarter Fowles with a layup. Stewart with a jumper. We\u2019re really just in garbage time at this point. USA 93-62, 6:29, 4th quarter Kondo fouls McCoughtry in a rebound attempt. Se drains two free throws. The good news: Japan finally gets a three-pointer to drop in this quarter, courtesy of Yuki Miyazawa. The bad news: time exists and only moves forward. USA 91-59, 6:59, 4th quarter The timeout doesn\u2019t help. Rui Machida gets into the game, only for her shot attempted to be blocked by (who else) Brittney Griner. Japan get the ball back but commit a shot clock violation. They are rattled. On the other end, McCoughtry sets up a layup for Moore, who now has 19 points. USA 89-59, 7:45, 4th quarter Moore-to-McCoughtry for a layup. Japan is now forced to attempt three-pointers to try to dig themselves out of the growing hole and they\u2019re not connecting, digging the hole even deeper in the process. McCoughtry with another layup. And then Griner scores. And then Japan takes a timeout. 30 point US lead. USA 83-59, 9:18, 4th quarter Japan wins the jump ball but Tokashiki\u2019s shot attempt is easily blocked by Griner. Japan gets the ball back, but Kurihara attempts a three pointer that doesn\u2019t go. The US get the ball back and Moore hits a jumper. That sequence feels like it encapsulates how this second half has been going. The US outscored Japan 25-13 in that third quarter. Can\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t make the adjustments. USA 81-59, end of the 3rd quarter Augustus with a jumper for the US. Tokashiki with a layup. Japan are still going to battle here, even if it already seems out of reach. Tamika Catchings is in the game now and she knocks down a three pointer which ends up being the last scoring of the third quarter. US now look like they have a rather comfortable advantage with 10 minutes to go. USA 76-55, 2:01, 3rd quarter Lindsey Whalen with a basket. Delle Donne is called for a foul and the US is over the limit so that\u2019s free throws for Japan. Tokashiki makes both free throws. USA 74-53, 2:53, 3rd quarter Tokashiki just flat out misses a gimme basket. Taurasi doesn\u2019t miss hers. It\u2019s a 21 point lead, so my pre-game prediction is starting to look more likely here. USA 72-53, 3:31, 3rd quarter Delle Donne hits a basket soon after though. USA 70-53, 3:59, 3rd quarter Takada with a jumper off the pick-and-roll coming out of the timeout. What they needed. USA 70-51, 4:21, 3rd quarter Augustus with a jumper. Taurasi hits a basket, not a three-pointer, but it\u2019s still enough to get Japan to call a timeout. The game is nearly out of reach already, however. USA 66-51, 5:03, 3rd quarter Motokawa on the line, another foul is called on Moore. That\u2019s her third, this could be significant. Motokawa makes only one of two free throws though. And Fowles turns the ball over. The door is creaking back open, ever so slightly here, for Japan. But Motokawa gets called for a travel. Nevermind. USA 66-50, 6:14, 3rd quarter Kurihara misses a three. Griner gets the rebound and after a little ball movement comes up with a layup and just like that the US has their biggest lead of the game. USA 64-50, 6:48, 3rd quarter Moore makes a jumper. Taurasi hits her fifth three. The US is starting to go on a roll. USA 59-50, 8:11, 3rd quarter Griner with a great block of a Yoshida layup but Japan gets the offensive rebound and Motokawa gets the layup. That has to be frustrating for the US. But they finally get some points in this second half thanks to a Maya Moore three. USA 56-48, 8:57, 3rd quarter Japan\u2019s been killing the US on the fast break, and they do it again here. Augustus turns the ball over, Kurihara gets the steal and Motokawa makes a jumper to start the second half scoring. USA 56-46, 9:46, 3rd quarter It\u2019s \u201cwait and see\u201d on Sue Bird\u2019s availability. She isn\u2019t on the floor to start the second half. The US have the ball, but immediately give it up when Griner is called for traveling. Email from Ann Haller: Thanks sooooo much for your very interesting comments! Go Team USA/Uconn!! ARH Thanks. This has been a lot of fun so far. The question is: how could Japan pull off an upset here. Well, it\u2019s partly to keep up the same level of intensity while also continuing to keep the US away from the free throw line. And then continue to have the same success from beyond the three point line. In other words: there\u2019s a way to do it. But it\u2019s a lot to ask a team. Hey Swin Cash! She\u2019s saying pretty much the same things as I am about how this game is going to progress. Which feels validating. Halftime thoughts A lot more entertaining first half than what I was expecting. I would normally say that the US should probably put some distance between them and Japan fairly quickly in the third but I\u2019m not entirely sure that Japan\u2019s going to go away that easily. I still don\u2019t see the US losing here, but it\u2019s now officially on the table. USA 56-46 Japan, end of the first half Taurasi with her biggest three-pointer of the Olympics. Seimone Augustus ends the first half by making back-to-back buckets to push the US lead back to ten by the end of the second quarter. USA 49-46 Japan, 1:12, 2nd quarter Angel McCoughtry makes a jumper to get the lead back to four points. But Tokashiki gets those points right back on the other end of the court. McCoughtry gets to the line, makes one of two free throws. Not a lot of free throw shooting this game, which is probably not good for the US but I\u2019m not complaining as a viewer. USA 46-44 Japan, 2:08, 2nd quarter Japan is playing the game of their lives. And they\u2019re not letting up. Breanna Stewart has the ball coming out of the timeout, but her three point attempt hits the rim. Japan gets another defensive rebound and Tokashiki hits a layup to make this a two point game! USA 46-42 Japan, 2:47, 2nd quarter YOSHIDA WITH A THREE! It\u2019s just a four point game! United States takes a very much needed timeout. USA 46-39 Japan, 3:06, 2nd quarter Japan playing some good defense here, picking up a few key rebounds to cut short US possessions. And Kurihara with a three pointer. It\u2019s back in single-digits. USA 46-36 Japan, 4:12, 2nd quarter Mamiya with a jumper. But there\u2019s Taurasi, hitting a three AND drawing a foul on the process. Four point play opportunity here\u2026 Except Taurasi misses the free throw. Despite the US\u2019s best efforts it\u2019s still only a 10 point lead. USA 43-34 Japan, 5:21, 2nd quarter Delle Donne with a three pointer. It works, so she tries it again her next go around, this one misses. On the other end Mamiya makes a layup. USA 43-32 Japan, 6:33, 2nd quarter Maya Moore with a hard foul on Asami Yoshida who makes one of two free throws. And Sue Bird limps off the court, that\u2019s not a good sign for the veteran Bird, who has been dealing with health issues for the last few years. USA 40-31 Japan, 6:57, 2nd quarter Taurasi actually misses a three-pointer. At this point of the Olympics, when she misses it\u2019s like when Steph misses a three: you\u2019re not entirely sure you can trust what you have just seen. And Kaede Kondo makes a three-pointer for Japan. Big basket there. USA 40-28 Japan, 7:30, 2nd quarter Maki Takada gets to the line and hits two free throws. Angel McCoughry with a jumper. Della Donne with a jumper and the US have opened up a 10 point lead. Wait, make that a twelve point lead. McCoughtry scores once again and Japan, realizing that this could be the game\u2019s turning point, takes a time out. USA 34-26 Japan, 9:07, 2nd quarter Elena Delle Donne with a layup. Kuriahara tries for another three pointer\u2026 and misses this time. Fowles gets the rebound. Seimone Augustus gets a shot off, but misses. Fowles cleans up on the boards, getting the rebound and laying it in. Second chance points are already a factor here in favor of the US. USA 30-26 Japan, 9:47, 2nd quarter Japan keeping this a game so far. We\u2019ll see if this will keep up or if the US starts to get separation. Well Japan wins the jump ball and they immediately cash in, Tokashiki with a three pointer. USA 30-23 Japan, end of the 1st quarter Tokashiki makes a jumper and that ends up being the last scoring in what was, until the last minute or so, a high-scoring first quarter. USA 30-21 Japan, 1:42, 1st quarter And US gets on a run. Charles finds Fowles for a layup. Whalen knocks down a jumper. Japan needs to score and make some shots. They get the score, Mika Kurihara hits a three pointer but not so much the stop. Not that there\u2019s been any way to stop Taurasi from hitting threes like she does here once again. USA 23-18 Japan, 3:08, 1st quarter Tina Charles a jumper. Sylvia Fowles is in the game now, and she tips in a Whalen layup after several attempts. Yuka Mamiya gets on the line to make two free throws. USA 19-16 Japan, 3:54, 1st quarter Diana Taurasi continues hitting three-pointers in this tournament. But Tokashiki hits a jumper in response. Yoshida fouls Maya Moore, which finally halts this quick-moving game. Moore gets on the line and makes both her free throws. USA 14-14 Japan, 4:50, 1st quarter Yuka Mamiya with a layup to tie things up. Japan is not playing like they\u2019re just happy to be here and that has to be a huge credit to them and their coach. USA 14-12 Japan, 5:44, 1st quarter Moore again. But it\u2019s just for two this time. Motokawa with a layup on the other end. Japan isn\u2019t standing down. USA 12-10 Japan, 7:04, 1st quarter Brittney Griner with a a layup Ramu Tokashiki hits a jumper in response. Fun start, this. Moore makes her second straight three-pointer. Yikes, that\u2019s not a good sign for Japan if she stays hot at long distances. USA 7-8 Japan, 7:56, 1st quarter Motokawa with a three pointer, briefly putting Japan ahead. Moore hits a three-pointer in response, however. And Mika Kurihara with a three. A lot of early long ball here. USA 4-2 Japan, 8:52, 1st quarter Sue Bird finds Tina Charles for a jumper, and the US counter. And Maya Moore with a layup! USA 0-2 Japan, 9:41, 1st quarter Japan scores first! Asami Yoshida win a steal, Sanae Motokawa with a layup! US starters: Sue Bird Maya Moore Diana Taurasi Tina Charles Britney Griner Japan starters: Yuka Mamiya Mika Kurihara Ramu Tokashiki Asami Yoshida Sanae Motokawa *goes to NBC live stream* \u201cCoverage To Begin Shortly.\u201d *hits refresh* \u201cCoverage To Begin Shortly.\u201d *hits refresh* Okay I may be a tad anxious for this game to start. This will be the last Olympics for several of the players on the US roster. Sean Deveney of the Sporting News wrote an appreciation of Diana Taurasi who has been setting records in what will probably be her last go around. Predictions The US team is going to win by at least 20 points. I have never been this confident since I predicted that the Carolina Panthers would defeat the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl by several touchdowns. *remembers how that went* Okay, there is a slight chance that my over-confidence could actually end up being a good omen for Japan. Anybody else want to make a stand before the game tips off? Feel free to take a stand and tweet @HunterFelt or email Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com with your predictions.

After that, Spain beat Turkey 64-62. I wouldn\u2019t expect our game\u2019s final score to be this close. After our game, Canada will face off against France around 9:15pm EST. This sounds like it should be hyperbole, but it\u2019s just the truth: the US women\u2019s team might be one of the greatest collections of basketball talent ever. Obviously, this statement will end up looking foolish should they somehow fail to win the gold but, unlike their peers on the men\u2019s team, they have yet to show any signs of vulnerability. While both teams are currently undefeated heading into the knockout rounds, the men\u2019s team has played three straight closer-than-expected games, while the women\u2019s team has been completely demolishing their competition. Their point differential during the preliminaries has been a ridiculous +204 while the men\u2019s team has put up a comparatively underwhelming +117 after winning their games against Serbia and France by only three points. So, it\u2019s not entirely certain that there\u2019s a team out there that could possibly knock the US women out of this tournament. It\u2019s definitely difficult to imagine this Japanese team pulling off the shocking upset. Japan has only familiar to US fans, Ramu Tokashiki, who plays for the Seattle Storm, where she received an All-Rookie nod in her debut season. Japan went 3-2 during the preliminary stage, squeaking into the quarterfinals as the fourth seed in Group A. (Oh, and for comparison their point differential so far in the Olympics has been +8). So it\u2019s a bit of an understatement to say that the US are the favorites in this matchup, but, well, there\u2019s a reason they play the games. That\u2019s the beauty of these Olympics: there\u2019s a 80% chance we\u2019ll witness a dominant performance, a 19% chance we\u2019ll have an entertaining game and a 1% chance of one of the most surprising upsets of the year. In any event, it should be fun. And, as always, we encourage your feedback. We\u2019ll post your emails (you can address those to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com) and tweets (to @HunterFelt) throughout today\u2019s game. Opening tip is scheduled at 5:45pm EST but I\u2019ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly.
