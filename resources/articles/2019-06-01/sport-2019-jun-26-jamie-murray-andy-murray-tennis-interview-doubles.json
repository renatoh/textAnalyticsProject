If you don\u2019t get the opportunity you have no chance.\u201d We are sitting above a plush indoor court at the Roehampton Club in south-west London, not far from the National Tennis Centre. Looking out at the impressive facilities, the thought occurs that this should be a time of roaring success for British tennis. Yet nobody is quite sure what the future holds and Murray, a man who chooses his words carefully, as though he wants each one to count, is keeping a watchful eye on the Lawn Tennis Association\u2019s next steps. Six months ago, when everyone thought that Andy Murray\u2019s career was all but over, Jamie accused the LTA of failing to build on his younger brother\u2019s legacy. Now, however, Andy is back. Last Sunday the former world No 1 marked his comeback from hip surgery by winning the doubles at Queen\u2019s alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez and is targeting a return to singles competition, postponing the sense of crisis. Yet the older Murray brother, now 33, knows the end will come one day. \u201cAndy won\u2019t play for ever,\u201d he says. \u201cThen what\u2019s behind him? There isn\u2019t much and you\u2019ll lose more interest in the game if you don\u2019t have a star at the top. You need someone competing with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.\u201d Murray, who has carved out an excellent doubles career, is here on behalf of Rackets Cubed, a charity that aims to help children from deprived areas with programmes focused on sport, education and nutrition. But how much appeal does tennis hold in its current state? Rightly or wrongly, it is yet to shed its elitist image in Britain, while participation levels dropped by 9% in 2018, and that worries Murray. \u201cUnfortunately it is still an expensive sport to get involved in,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to pay for courts, rackets and balls. I know the LTA wants to open up the game to the masses.\u201d Murray thinks about his mother, Judy, and her grassroots initiatives. \u201cIn Scotland it\u2019s taken it to rural areas, all over the country and into inner cities. She has initiatives to get young girls involved in tennis. It\u2019s important we capitalise on the interest Andy has generated. It\u2019s a golden opportunity. We won\u2019t get a chance like this again. \u201cTennis Scotland also needs to do more. Andy transcends tennis in this country. You won\u2019t get another Andy for God knows how long. We want a kid in the east end of Glasgow who\u2019s watching us play on television and wants to try tennis to have the opportunity. But he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s frustrating for us. You lose people that way.\u201d Murray offers encouraging words about Scott Lloyd, two years into his role as the LTA\u2019s chief executive, and trusts the right man is steering the ship. For Dunblane\u2019s second most famous son that means investing in coaching, facilities and attracting people to the game. \u201cMake sure it doesn\u2019t cost much to play,\u201d Murray says. \u201cThat\u2019s the remit of our governing body, right? It\u2019s to grow tennis. They are trying to have more free courts, which will allow people to just pitch up and play in parks and local communities. There are things Scott is putting in place that will not bear fruit in six months or a year. It might take three or five years. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s right.\u201d For all Murray\u2019s straight talking about British tennis, warmth pours from him when the conversation switches to his brother\u2019s recovery from a chronic hip injury. \u201cDaily life was too painful for two years. It was debilitating. Now he has no pain after the surgery and his mood is lifted overnight. You get your passion taken away from you, you learn to appreciate it more. You could see it last week. He was so happy to be back playing and competing. It was cool to see.\u201d Murray, who shares tennis tips on his new YouTube channel, still has much to achieve. In 2007 he won the mixed doubles alongside Jelena Jankovic at Wimbledon and in 2016, the same year Andy became the best singles player in the world, he rose to the top of the doubles rankings after linking up with Bruno Soares. Murray flourished with Soares, winning the Australian Open and the US Open, only to split with the Brazilian after losing in the first round of the French Open last month. \u201cIt just felt like I wanted a change. I wanted a different perspective. It would have been safe for me to keep playing with Bruno. We probably would have kept qualifying for the ATP Tour Finals at the end of the year and we\u2019d still win events. It\u2019s a risky play. But three and a half years is a long time to play with someone. There was a lot of time invested in that relationship and he\u2019s one of my best friends on the tour.\u201d The vacancy seemed like an invite for the Murray brothers to reprise their double act from the Davis Cup. \u201cWe really wanted to,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cThis year was as good as any but just for different reasons, mainly timing, it didn\u2019t happen. At some point in the future we\u2019d both like to do it.\u201d Instead Jamie has teamed up with another Brit, Neal Skupski, and Andy will play with the excellent Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert at Wimbledon. Improbably, they will be rivals at SW19. The brothers have only been on opposite sides of the net once before, in the doubles in Montreal in 2015, and Jamie does not want to repeat the experience despite winning that one. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be across the net from each other,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t play each other at Wimbledon. But we could play in the first round. It could be the final. It\u2019s a strange contrast of emotions because ultimately the goal is to win. But at the same time you also want your brother to win and you have to beat him.\u201d Who Judy would support? \u201cHa!\u201d Murray says. \u201cGood question. You can ask her that. There\u2019s no chance she\u2019d watch. No chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
