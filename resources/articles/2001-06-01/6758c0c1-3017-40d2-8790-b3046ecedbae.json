Mr Vaz insisted he had resigned on health grounds. Tony Blair, in a letter, thanked Mr Vaz for his work in office, saying: \"You have been put under intolerable pressure recently, which can only have aggravated your illness.\" Mr Hain was unexpectedly transferred from the foreign office earlier this year following the reshuffle caused by the resignation of Peter Mandelson. A former Eurosceptic who has softened his views in recent years, Mr Hain has been told by Mr Blair to increase British influence in Europe and network with his fellow European ministers. The Cabinet Office, led by John Prescott and Lord MacDonald, has been strengthened with the appointment of Barbara Roche and Sally Morgan, the former political secretary at Downing Street. Ms Morgan is to be made a life peer, as part of a restructuring of Downing Street. The new attorney general Lord Goldsmith replaces Lord Williams, who has been made leader of the Lords. There were 23 new ministers appointed, including three previously-ousted ministers now restored to office. Mr Blair dismissed 18 mainly older colleagues. The restored ministers include Alun Michael - the chief casualty of Welsh devolution and an ally of Mr Blair's - as number two in the new Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Nigel Griffiths, an ally of Gordon Brown, is also brought back. Michael Meacher, seen as one of the successes of the first term government, is to remain as environment minister, one of the few ministers staying on in his old post. Volunteers for the backbenches were Joyce Quinn, who told Mr Blair some months ago she wanted to step down, Baroness Hayman, a veteran of the 70s, and the independent-minded Chris Mullin, who wants to become a select committee chairman again. What he called his \"visit to the foothills of government\" will stand him in good stead in seeking a new post as select committee chairman. Mr Mullin was frustrated by the lack of influence within office. Indications that the new leader of the Commons, Robin Cook, will be eager to modernise parliament were strengthened with the news that a fellow reformer, Stephen Twigg, has been appointed as his deputy. Among the women promoted into government for the first time are Ruth Kelly, the former Bank of England economist, Sally Keeble, Hazel Blears, and Rosie Winterton. Maria Eagle also joins the government for the first time, joining her twin sister Angela who switches from social security to the Home Office. Lord Rooker has been made minister of state in the Home Office responsible for asylum policy. In the Commons home secretary David Blunkett has been given two talented ministers of state in John Denham and Keith Bradley, the former deputy whip. The two key figures at the Department of Education, apart from the new secretary of state Estelle Morris, will be the former Islington council leader Margaret Hodge, who has been given responsibility for universities, and Stephen Timms, who has been handed the job of school standards. Lord Falconer, once seen as the eyes and ears of the Prime Minister on Downing Street, has been transferred to the department for transport, local government and regions. He is unlucky enough to retain responsibility for the dome. Hilary Benn, the son of Tony Benn who left the Commons at the election, joins the government as junior minister at the Department of International Development. Other class of 97 MPs who join the government include two europhiles in the Foreign Office - Ben Bradshaw and Denis MacShane. John Healey, the former parliamentary aide to Gordon Brown, has been appointed a junior minister in the new Department of Education and Skills, alongside Ivan Lewis, MP for Bury South. Dick Caborn, the close ally of John Prescott, replaces Kate Hoey as sports minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
