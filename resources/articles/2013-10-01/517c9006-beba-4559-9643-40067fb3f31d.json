I haven\u2019t received any angry emails from any Guardian bigwigs, so I think I might have just about got away with it. It's fortunate that nobody actually reads these things. If you want to get in touch on Twitter with any messages of good luck or offers of work, I\u2019m @StuHeritage. If not, I\u2019ll see you back here next week, where the subject of the liveblog is likely to be Rush Hour 3. Unless it turns out that Jackie Chan is Alan Rusbridger\u2019s brother or something. I should probably check. Anyway, bye! In the hospital, a nurse tends to a patient. It is Valerie. She is covered in bandages. LIKE A MUMMY. Irony. The end. However, it's too late. The princess wakes up. And then Valerie stabs her. And then a vase tips over and some ceiling falls on her. She's probably dead. Creepy Guy reads out The Scroll Of Life. The severed hand magically attaches to the mummified princess. Valerie's dad realises that maybe resurrecting an evil princess is a silly idea, so he strangles Creepy Guy to death mid-sentence. Also, Valerie's eyeliner has gone a bit Egyptian. That's the level of spookiness we've all come to expect from this film. But wait. Valerie's dad has just arbitrarily found the severed hand and something called The Scroll Of Life. They were just there on a mantlepiece. But before he can do anything, Valerie has walked up behind him and started touching him up. I think this means that the resurrection is almost complete. But, really, who knows at this point. Ah. Valerie has run away to the final archaeologist. In a negligee, obviously. The archaeologist gives Valerie an antique dog. Then there's a thunderstorm and the antique dog looks at the archeologist until her face starts bleeding. It's more exciting that I've made it sound, but only just. Now we're talking. Valerie is running though some woods that didn't exist five minutes ago. Creepy Guy is convincing Valerie's Dad to burn Sunglasses Doctor in an incinerator. It's got a bit cloudy. THIS FILM IS ALL GO. Oh great. Here we go. Valerie has woken up as the princess and killed Sunglasses Doctor. From now on, this film will be a non-stop rampage of horror and violence. You wait and see. Valerie is having another bout of restless sleep now. She's either speaking in tongues or blurting out faux-profound platitudes. But there's harp this time, so it counts as progress. Creepy guy and Valerie's dad are having an argument about the moral repercussions of resurrecting an ancient evil spirit. It's like the last series of Lost, only made for tuppence and quite boring. Todd leaves. Valerie screams. Todd crashes his car into a tree and dies. Valerie is upset at herself. Everyone watching is sort of grateful. We're back. Valerie is in the tomb room, looking at the bleeding mummy. This irks Todd. \"This is precious and fantastic\", Valerie protests. I suspect she isn;t talking about Todd's beard. There's an advert for X Factor. My liveblogging worlds are colliding, and I don't like it one bit. Todd discovers the archaeologist in a smoke-filled alleyway, with piles of scrap metal on top of him. He is dead. The moral of the story is that you should always give doppelg\u00e4ngers of evil dead Egyptian princesses any jackals you own as soon as they ask for them. Back to the film. Valerie and her harp hair have visited another old archaeologist. Valerie wants an ancient jackal that the archaeologist has. I think she's trying to collect all of the princess's possessions back in order to resurrect her. Or maybe she's just really into jackals. Who isn't? This film finishes in less than half an hour. So far, nothing has happened. Although there was some blood, and it did come from a mummy's tomb, so we can't sue anyone under the trade descriptions act. I am literally the only person in the world who's watching this, aren't I? There is a plan on the part of one of the creepy men to resurrect the princess, because then he'd be able to control the world or something. Valerie seems surprisingly up for this. Valerie has apparently taken it upon herself to find the princess's missing hand. Luckily it's literally right across the road so she goes to get it. Also, she's wearing a purple mac with the most insane collar I have ever seen. 1971, ladies and gentlemen. Valerie and her dad are having a nice heart to heart about how he robbed the grave of an evil princess and how everyone's definitely going to die because of it. It's sweet, really. Valerie's dad has woken up from his coma. This gives Valerie the perfect opportunity to wear an even smaller negligee than before and pout all sexily at him. Because nothing heals the ill better than enormous sexual confusion. THINGS PEOPLE FOUND SCARY IN 1971: * Doors. * Laughter. * Old men rolling their eyes at shadows of snakes and then dying. MEANWHILE AT THE LUNATIC ASYLUM: Two wardens who are hamming it up for comic effect are strapping our lunatic into a straitjacket and making him look at that snake he loves so much. Then. because this is a lunatic asylum, we're treated to a full 90-second sequence of some doors and maniacal laughter. That's literally all there is onscreen for 90 seconds. Some doors and some laughter. I'd say this film is silly, but I want to keep my job, so I won't. Todd's figuring out what we've already known for an hour - that the princess forced her spirit into Valerie's body when she was born. Only he's saying this in a really boring way, and he's wearing a horrible shirt, so it's a bit annoying. I've just realised that the main image for this article, when you find it on the film site, is of the 3D mini-me I had made last week. I am genuinely sorry for that. It is much scarier than this film. Ah. The lunatic from earlier was one of the archaeologists. Todd and Valerie visit him, but he wants nothing to do with it. However, he's somehow convinced to engage with them by all the harp music that keeps coming out of Valerie's hair. But it all goes wrong - he mistakes Valerie for the Egyptian princess and has a panic attack. Well, you would too if you saw a dead princess with harp-hair. Creepy Guy has ordered Todd to round up the old gang of archeologists who found the princess, so that they can reunite her with her soul. I liveblogged a film about this exact subject by chance last week, in fact. They should chuck her off a cliff. That seemed to work last week. I should point out that Valerie hasn't got dressed throughout all of this. Perhaps it's just a warm evening. One of the creepy men from earlier tracks Valerie down and reveals that her dad discovered the mummified princess at exactly the precise moment that Valerie was born. And they look alike. Are they the same person? Oh, probably. So Valerie does the only thing she can - strip down to an incredibly low cut negligee and walk around inside her dad's tomb room in soft focus. Distraught, Valerie rests her head on the chest of her comatose father. Harps start playing. It's definitely her hair that's making that noise. They call a doctor. The doctor wears sunglasses and a yellow shirt. I do not trust him. Valerie rushes to her father's house for no reason. \"Did you feel that?\" she asks Todd. \"NYEEEEEEERRSSS\" says Todd, inconclusively. But then there's a scream. It's Valerie's dad, in his basement (which he's done up to look like a mummy's tomb) with blood coming out of his neck. Oh, that was a flashback. And this bit's a flashback too, to when Valerie's mother as she was giving birth. Or is it a dream? It's hard to tell. Todd seems to be able to play Valerie's hair like a harp, though, which is quite impressive. I'm warming to this chap. The archeologist has opened the mummy's tomb and is slowly gazing around at its contents. It's like the slowest, driest episode of Cribs you've ever seen. They pull back the sarcophagus to find the body of a woman who looks just like Valerie. This doesn't seem to phase her dad, though, because he's too busy wrenching a massive ring off her severed hand. It's the ring that he gives to Valerie for her birthday. What a bloody cheapskate. Right. So. The ghost of the women who was being mummified at the start of the film has guided two archeologists to her tomb. One of them is Valerie's dad, who may or may be Merope's gradfather. I think that's how this works. Valerie's having that dream again. The one about how awful the ring is. The ring that she's wearing. Perhaps Valerie needs to have a go on one of those Brain Training games that everyone used to love. THINGS ADVERTISED DURING HAMMER HORROR FILMS: bread, beer, follow-on milk, wee with blood in it. Back at the museum, two sinister men are onto Valerie. By 'onto', I mean they're talking about her in incredibly loose terms and staring at each other agog. Something is up. But what could it be? Something to do with mummies? Or blood? Or tombs? My guess is all of the above. I wish I'd read the Bram Stoker book that this film is based on. Especially the chapter entitled 'The Girl With Big Boobs Eats A Banana In Slow Motion'. Todd, meanwhile, can hold the ring without dying. This is a terrible shame. And Valerie can slowly eat a banana near it, because she's a girl and this was the 1970s. Valerie's boyfriend - whose name is Todd - takes Valerie's birthday ring to a museum to show it to a man who exists solely to collapse and die as soon as he sees it. Clearly, this ring is not to be mucked around with. MEANWHILE AT THE LUNATIC ASYLUM: a man with a cane is visiting an inmate. The inmate tries to strangle him, because that's what lunatics were obliged to do in the 1970s. Apparently the man wanted a plastic snake that the lunatic keeps. I don't know why. Perhaps I'll never know why. Valerie's boyfriend is an awful man with terrible dress sense, an alcohol problem and a half-grown beard that absolutely doesn't suit him at all. You know, I think I might be in with a chance here. OK, let's try and work out what's actually going on. That guy was Valerie's dad. And it's her birthday. And her dad has bought her a ring. It's the ring that the severed hand from her dream was wearing. Even though she literally just had a dream about it, and it was so horrifying that she woke up screaming, Valerie has absolutely no recollection of the ring whatsoever. She should probably try to work on her short-term memory. A severed hand crawls across the desert. Valerie wakes up screaming. An old man - her dad? Her grandpa? Santa - comforts her. \"It'll soon be over\" he says. Maybe for her, but I've got two more hours of this. So. Valerie Leon has been mummified. Or has she? She might be dreaming it. Or she might be the mummy's descendent. Either way, you have to commend her ability to sleep as soundly as she is with all that bloody harp music going on in the background. Oh, wait, it is Egypt. And there's Merope's mum again. Now she's an Egyptian queen. A dead Egyptian queen who's undergoing a fairly graphic mummification process. Obviously she's doing this in an ancient sparkly bikini, because of course she is. The film opens with Merope's mum heaving her cleavage around in bed. I am definitely getting fired. But wait. Now we're somewhere else. The moon? I'd guess it was Egypt by the context of this film, but it doesn't look very Egypty. It looks like Anthea Turner's version of Tracey Island. Produced by Howard Brandy. I wish I was called Howard Brandy. So far it's just a shot of the night sky and some yellow sans serif titles. It could quite easily be a Wes Anderson film, really. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen: Blood From The Mummy's Tomb. Even the adverts for butter on The Horror Channel are terrifying. Lord knows what the actual film itself's going to be like. Incidentally, if you\u2019re ever planning to Google \u2018Blood From The Mummy\u2019s Tomb\u2019, be sure to type it as quickly as you possibly can. That way you won\u2019t have to look at all the various \u2018Blood From\u2019 autocompletes. Trust me, you really don\u2019t want to see them. Good evening everyone, and welcome to what might very well be the last thing I ever write for The Guardian. You see, the subject of tonight\u2019s Film on the Box liveblog is Blood From The Mummy\u2019s Tomb, a 1971 Hammer Horror film that starts on The Horror Channel at 9pm. And that\u2019s all well and good, apart from one thing. My boss\u2019s mum is in it. Valerie Leon (who plays the vengeful ghost of the titular mummy) is the mother of Merope Mills, who edits the Saturday Guardian. This isn\u2019t a secret \u2013 Merope wrote about what it\u2019s like to be the daughter of an actress years ago \u2013 but I\u2019m still worried because I do quite like being in The Guardian on Saturdays. I\u2019m stuffed, aren\u2019t I? Slag off the film and I\u2019ll end up sacked. Go too far the other way and admit that I fancy Valerie Leon and I\u2019ll end up sacked. And this is a low-budget 1970s horror film about a sexy ghost who runs around in her underwear a lot. I am almost completely definitely going to do at least one of those two things before the film ends. Anyway, the film. It\u2019s adapted from the Bram Stoker book The Jewel of Seven Stars, Peter Cushing was supposed to be in it but had to pull out when his wife fell ill and the director died of a heart attack a week before filming ended. Variety called it \u2018Well-acted\u2019 but \u2018tame\u2019, The New York Times said it was \u2018Tremendous fun, skillful and wonderfully energetic\u2019. It also called Valerie Leon \u2018A 500 per cent knockout\u2019, and nobody there got fired for saying it, so maybe I\u2019ll be OK. Blood From The Mummy\u2019s Tomb start on The Horror Channel at 9pm. I\u2019d love it if you joined in, because I\u2019m clearly going to need all the help I can get."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
