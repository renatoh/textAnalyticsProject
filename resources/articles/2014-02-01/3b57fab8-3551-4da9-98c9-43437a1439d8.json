Speaking via Skype, the Black Eyed Peas frontman called the music industry \u201cdelusional\u201d. \"I try my hardest not dwell on it, so I try to focus on my philanthropy.\u201d Will.i.am pointed to the successive decline in revenue from recorded music that the industry has experienced for more than a decade as a reason to get into the hardware business. He said he had made more money from his equity in Beats Electronics \u2013 the makers of Beats by Dr Dre headphones \u2013 than what he made from Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling, the most downloaded song of all times on iTunes. \u201cRecord labels should not compete with other labels \u2013 they should compete with Samsung, with LG,\u201d he said. \u201cI challenge you to challenge those you think you probably shouldn\u2019t go up against. That\u2019s what Dr Dre did with Beats.\u201d The global music superstar, entrepreneur and philanthropist later told the Guardian that the world had seen the transformation going on today before, a hundred years ago, during the industrial revolution. \"African-Americans weren't part of that conversation back then,\" he said. \"What we're seeing now is the technological revolution \u2013 and inner city kids should be a part of that conversation.\" That's why Will.i.am launched the TRANS4M initiative, which is part of the i.am angel foundation he launched in 2009. The foundation\u2019s aim is to promote and expand education in the areas of science, technology, engineering, arts &amp; athletics and mathematics (i.am STEAM), by providing scholarships, financial literacy and college preparation for underprivileged young people. In 2012, he brought TRANS4M to the UK, working with the Prince\u2019s Trust, as it didn\u2019t have a STEAM programme at the time. He said that going back to Boyle Heights, the LA neighbourhood he grew up in, inspired him to \u201cgive back\u201d. \u201cI wanted to do more than reaping the money and the fame, and live the way the videos and magazines suggest successful artists should live.\u201d \u201cWhy wait for an earthquake or hurricane or tornado for someone in the music industry to wake up and use their success to focus? Every day there\u2019s an earthquake or a hurricane, and no one pays attention. I wanted to address everyday urgent things that aren\u2019t in Rolling Stones or the latest hot blog.\" Growing up listening to Public Enemy, KRS 1 and Rage Against the Machine, will.i.am said that his impression of what hip-hop should be was \u201ceach one to teach one\u201d and \u201cfight the power\u201d. \u201cIt has stopped being that,\u201d he continued. \u201cLook, artists don\u2019t have to rap about [transforming their neighbourhood] \u2013 my latest song doesn\u2019t reflect my philanthropy \u2013 but you should use the power you have to go and fix it.\u201d He has said that he only sleeps about four hours a night, which allows him to invest time in a vast number of projects, including launching his own self-funded i.am+ consumer electronics business last year, serving as Intel\u2019s director of creative innovation, creating and co-founding the Coca-Cola company\u2019s EKOCYCLE recycling strategy, and founding and hosting the TRANS4M conference \u2013 as well as write, produce, record and perform music and being a judge and mentor on BBC 1\u2019s The Voice. \u201cThis is the new rockstar lifestyle,\u201d will.i.am told the Guardian. \u201cBono does it. The question is: do you go to the Grammys or to Davos? We know the old definition of the word, but this is 2014 and that is not what I want to be. I want to be a rocket star, see the planet from above and then transform it.\u201d \u2022 Will.i.am brings his $475 iPhone camera accessory to Macworld"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
