Great, Small Talk, and you? Not a bother, Justin. Say, as an All Black legend you're just the man to answer this question: how should an opposing team respond to the haka? Turn their backs? Shout their defiance? Stick up their middle fingers? I've had to face it actually, which was really bizarre. In 2003 before the World Cup I played for the Barbarians against the All Blacks, for whom I'd previously played 70-odd Tests \u2013 yet here I was facing the haka. It was really strange but I enjoyed it. Yes, but what did you do? Because I know the mentality and psyche of it, then I knew that they're not actually getting anything out of it so I knew to just watch and be respectful because that's basically what it's about. The haka is a part of New Zealand rugby and we go through the ritual because it's part of our history \u2013 we don't do it to gain any kind of advantage over the opposition so all they should be thinking is: 'Well, that's something they have to do so let them do it and then we can get on with the game.' So if England were to respond by, say, morris dancing, that wouldn't help? [Chortles] That would be ridiculous, to be fair. The Australians, God bless 'em, came out with this Waltzing Matilda thing and I just thought: 'That's how you answer the haka?' [Guffaws] It doesn't really compare, does it? And I don't really see why they felt the need to do it \u2013 were they thinking 'Oh, they're going to do the haka so they're going to play well'? That's a load of bollocks. You can have good hakas and bad hakas \u2013 you know, sometimes the timing might be a bit off or whatever \u2013 and plenty of times we've done a bad haka yet started the Test on fire and other times we've done a real good haka and conceded a try in the first five minutes. It gives you no energy whatsoever in terms of the game. Do you practise the haka in training? Yeah, you have to practise it. You always start the season with some haka practice and introduce new guys to the words and how to do it properly. You get told the background to it, the history, why it's there and what the words mean. If Small Talk had the balls to put it to you that, compared to football, rugby isn't really a game of skill and, as such, a top rugby player can be manufactured whereas a top footballer is born, how would you respond? Absolute rubbish! With rugby you get naturally gifted players who have those skills for all sorts of different reasons \u2013 someone might be powerful, have quick feet or the ability to read the game very well. Whatever it is, they have these skills that make them able to do things that other players can't do. What a coach has to do is get the best out of those people every time they go out and play \u2013 it's not about coaching them out of their strengths, it's about getting their strengths out of them. It's a man-management thing. It's a gameplan thing, but effectively individuals are what they are because they do things other people can't. Which coach was the biggest influence on you? I think Robbie Deans, who's now coaching Australia. He was very much at the forefront for me when I started and when I moved to Crusaders. And Wayne Smith gave me the best piece of advice I've ever had. I was going through a bad patch and he told me to go out and trust my instincts and be decisive \u2013 you need to trust what you do is going to be the right thing and if you do it decisively you'll make good of it even if it's the wrong option because you'll do it with purpose. That's the best piece of advice I've been given. Was there a point in your life when you realised you were going to be a rugby great, or was it a gradual evolution? I think when you're initially on that journey as a youngster you're just happy to go along. It started when I got selected for my club team, then the province team to play for Southland, and then I got selected to play for the New Zealand Under-19s. I was just happy to be getting the opportunities that were regularly coming my way \u2013 I never ever thought it'd turn into an occupation. I never thought I'd play for the All Blacks. I was just happy with my lot but more kept coming. But I've never taken it for granted because I've played with players with lots of skill and a freakish nature about them, and who do things on a rugby ball which are incredible to see. For me, I've always had to work hard to get what I get. In fact, in New Zealand a few years back, someone asked my mother what makes Justin such a special player and she replied: 'To be fair, his two brothers were probably more talented but he's just more driven. He wanted it more.' Any idea where that drive came from? No, I haven't actually. I think it's when you get to a point when you're getting and tasting success, it becomes infectious and you don't want that feeling to go away. I always knew that the minute I take it for granted someone else will come in and take what I've got. I never ever wanted anybody to be able to beat me. I was always very fit but I always did extra runs anyway. I remember that even at the World Cup in 2003 I'd run home \u2013 I just wanted to be super fit and I felt that if I was fitter I could do a lot more things on the rugby field but I don't really know where that motivation comes from. Small Talk was recently watching an U-11 match and there were some good players: but there were also a couple of big, strong, fast lads who were absolute wusses. We recommended that the coach beat them with sticks to instil a bit of anger and aggression into them. That was wise, right? No, drive can't be taught. I think it's something you just have to have. You eventually find what's in you and some don't find it until late. I tread very carefully along the lines of the coach thing because you can turn people away. You can turn them into robots. If a kid doesn't have the drive that you feel he should have it doesn't mean he won't get it. If you try and make them determined too early you'll probably point them in the wrong direction. I didn't find success in rugby until I was around 15 \u2013 before that I'd played on good teams but I wasn't anything special. So I'd tread very carefully when it comes to pushing people. Right, we'll stash the sticks, for now. If Small Talk was going to take a short holiday in New Zealand, what's the one thing we should definitely see or do? New Zealand's most famous tourist spot is Queenstown and you'd be missing out on a gem if you decided not to go there. Not only is it an adventure capital but it's also beautiful at any time of the year, the lakes and the rivers are amazing, and in the winter there's snowboarding and all that. Also if you like your wine, you've definitely got to go to the top of the South Island up around Nelson and Canterbury because there's an amazing piece of land there called the Marlborough Sounds and it's just like being in another world. It's got boating, alcoves, walks and some fantastic wineries. Absolutely beautiful vineyards. Sounds splendid. What, Justin, is the last piece of music that you bought? [Excited] I was doing a function for Audi at which Ronan Keating was supposed to perform but it was at the same time that the tragedy happened to his friend Stephen Gately so he had to pull out. So at the last minute Audi called in this band, The Feeling, and, honestly mate, they came in and they just rocked the joint! They were awesome! I went out and got the CD and said I've got to take it back to New Zealand with me because people will love it. You know what, Small Talk is not sure it has ever heard any New Zealand bands \u2026 Mate, have you head of Crowded House? Actually yes, we have, but we thought they were Australian \u2026 [Peeved] Yeah, I know, unbelievable! Honestly, anything good that comes out of New Zealand Australians think that they should own it. They think Russell Crowe is Australian \u2013 honestly, they're relentless! What is your favourite vegetable? Listen, I'm a very, very big fan of Japanese food. So sushi and sashimi are the things for me. And I love seafood \u2013 oysters, prawns, crayfish, all that sort of thing. I dive in New Zealand and get all my own stuff fresh. So is the food over here a bit of a let-down? The seafood is more difficult to come by but the food in general I've come to like, to be fair. Welsh lamb, for instance, that's great. What is your favourite flower? [Considers awhile] The lilly. Why? I just like it. I think it's quite long-lasting, to be fair. I know that whenever I buy my wife a bunch of lillies, mate, they're still there three weeks later! So it's the value for money you like? You know, I think that's what it is, deep down I'm a tight-arse! Have you ever seen a ghost? No, I'm not that way inclined. When we were looking to buy a house in Swansea we looked at one and my wife refused to buy it because from the top window you could see, way in the distance, a cemetery. She said she couldn't live in a house where there could be dead people walking around in the middle of the night! I just thought: 'I can't believe you just said that.' Doesn't that place quite a restriction on where you can live, given that there's hardly a sod in little Britain that doesn't have a dead person underneath it? Yeah, you're right. And if there's gonna be a ghost around maybe you're better off by a cemetery \u2013 that way they'll all fight against each other rather than bother you! Have you ever seen a UFO? No. But I do like looking for bizarre things flying around the sky, you know what I mean? I wish I could say I've seen one but I haven't. What was your favourite toy when you were a child, apart from a rugby ball? I had a trolley that I used to use as a lawnmower for some reason. I used to love pretending to mow the lawns \u2013 I had a little catcher on it and everything. It wasn't a proper one like you see kids with nowadays \u2013 the catcher was just a red bucket. And the trolley was nicked from the local supermarket? Yeah, that's the one! Do you still have it? No, my mother is a bit of a hoarder but I don't think she's kept that. Finally, Justin, can you tell us a joke? Oh mate, no. I don't really know great jokes. Can you not just make one up for me \u2013 a real good one? That's quite an amount of trust you're placing in Small Talk: can you be sure we won't stick in something terribly offensive and tarnish your reputation forever? Actually, to be fair, I don't often tell jokes. In fact, I'm not a joke-type of person at all, so you know what, mate, don't put one in. That's probably for the best. So long, Justin, it's been great talking to you. Bye! Likewise, Small Talk. Bye, buddy.
