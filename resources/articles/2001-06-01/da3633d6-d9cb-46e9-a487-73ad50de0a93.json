The English trio of Paul Hession, Alan Wilkinson and Simon Fell are carriers of the flame, and they have spent many years making a horrible racket and not giving a damn. As performance art, this gig was quite entertaining, thanks mainly to Fell's hilarious grappling with his double bass. He played his instrument as if he was in some way trying to revenge himself upon it, attacking the strings with drum sticks while his bandmates kept straight faces and got on with the serious business of making the aforementioned racket. Wilkinson's saxophone reeked of sulphuric selfdisgust. On separate occasions he produced creditable impressions of babies screaming and witches being burned at the stake. Meanwhile, Hession played a continuous drumroll around his kit, rumbling away ostentatiously and firing off rapid rim shots that could have been played on human skulls. Throughout, it was unclear whether the musicians were striving for a collective goal or just trying to outdo each other in being acutely unlistenable. Their crescendos were blistering, but the aggression seemed impotent and desperate, evoking the cries of the eternally damned rather than the fury of an army. The final, admittedly stimulating, question remained: \"What is this actually all about?\" Traditionally, free jazz was a political music, an undiluted howl of protest against the continuing exploitation of African-American people. This presumably is not the motive of Messrs Fell, Wilkinson and Hession. All three men are virtuosos, but you do not need musical skill to make people put their hands over their ears. Their intellectual justifications for giving their audience a headache would make an interesting topic for an esoteric lecture tour - perhaps they could consider doing that instead and saving us money on painkillers?
