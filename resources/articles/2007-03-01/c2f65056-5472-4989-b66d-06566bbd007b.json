The Maryland band began as grunge-lite punk-pop merchants in the mould of Green Day or Blink 182, but now favour a sleek angst-rock that would be rejected from the soundtrack of The OC for lack of emotional depth. The soft-focus self-pity of Misery and Broken Hearts Parade is heavily indebted to the solipsistic sentimentality of emo kingpins My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy, while the mawkish melodrama of All Black (\"Take a look at my clothes, all black like Johnny Cash/ Like the Rolling Stones when they sang Paint it Black\") is so preposterous that you long for Good Charlotte to be poking fun at themselves. Sadly, they are not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
