He has also signalled the opposition will look for opportunities to work in a bipartisan way on budget repair in the new parliament. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Chalmers said Labor retained concerns about the government\u2019s super policies, and he said the opposition would prefer the changes be the subject of an independent review, \u201cbut at the end of the day, [the government\u2019s proposals] might be the best opportunity to get some sort of resolution on those very expensive tax breaks at the top end of the super system\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always been relatively confident that we can get a good outcome,\u201d Chalmers said in the interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve led this conversation. We are very keen willing and able to be part of it over the next few months as well.\u201d The superannuation package remains contentious within government ranks, and the internal ructions have prompted the treasurer, Scott Morrison, to flag changes to the package the government brought forward originally in the budget before taking it to the election. Morrison earlier this week confirmed a new exposure draft will include exemptions for major life events, in effect watering down the caps designed to curb the use of superannuation as a tax minimisation measure. There is an expectation on the new parliamentary crossbench that the super package will pass with Labor\u2019s support, giving the government one concrete mechanism early in the term for addressing budget repair. Chalmers stepped around a question about what specific discussions the opposition had had with the Coalition on the super package, saying he thought the government knew where Labor stood on the issue. Chalmers also sent a signal that superannuation wasn\u2019t the only issue on which the major parties could reach agreement on in the new parliament. He said both major parties needed \u201cto find a way to be more open minded and constructive \u2026 because that\u2019s what people expect\u201d. Chalmers acknowledged that would require cultural change and a step back from \u201creflexive opposition to things\u201d. \u201cI think the public expect more bipartisanship,\u201d he said. Recently the former Labor frontbencher Craig Emerson \u2013 Chalmers\u2019s predecessor in the Queensland seat of Rankin \u2013 said Labor could invite the government to form a cross-party committee in the coming parliament tasked with seeking agreement on a set of acceptable budget measures. Chalmers said the idea of a joint committee was probably a bridge too far for the government, but the principle underlying Emerson\u2019s idea was a sound one. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about a formal committee with a formal membership. I\u2019m not sure the government would come at that even if that was our preference,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cBut I certainly think his underlying point about the people expecting the parties to come together to repair the budget, I think that\u2019s a point well made.\u201d He said the public perception in recent years was the major parties disagreed on most things, but the reality was more nuanced. \u201cI think in the public people think we disagree on every single thing but \u2026 there is from time to time, some agreement.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for the country. We look for those opportunities. And certainly in the job I\u2019m in now, the finance portfolio, I\u2019m looking very keenly for the ways the two parties can agree to repair the budget,\u201d he said. Chalmers said the Turnbull government missed a significant opportunity during the last electoral cycle by rebuffing Labor\u2019s proposals to reform negative gearing. Given Labor was providing political cover to address the concessions, choosing to make that a point of partisan contention was a missed opportunity for structural repair of the budget. The objective in the future should be to look for common ground. But he said bipartisanship in the new parliament could not be a blank cheque. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean just copping or signing up to things that attack vulnerable people in the community and it doesn\u2019t mean signing up to things that hollow out the future of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to always agree.\u201d \u2022 Jim Chalmers was interviewed for the latest episode of the fortnightly podcast, Australian Politics Live"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
