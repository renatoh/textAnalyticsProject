Tell us something new The black arts of business practice are nowhere so murky as in dealings between the Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems, but throw in the Serious Fraud Office and you really do have a witch's brew. It comes as no surprise that BAE executives were allowed to spend lavishly on 'entertainment' for Saudi officials. In the Desert Kingdom, nothing moves unless it is greased with copious amounts of cash, and it could be argued that BAE got good value for the British taxpayer with the al-Yamamah contract, potentially worth up to \u00a350 billion over its lifetime. So what if BAE cash was spent on prostitutes, sports cars and yachts? And if some BAE executives had to sample the same delights to keep their guests company, again, so what? That is how Saudi Arabia does business, and if you don't like it, then get out of Saudi Arabia altogether. Unfortunately for the house of Saud, that is what some American executives are now seriously proposing, for altogether different reasons. The Saudis are being sued by victims of the September 11 attacks, who point out that most of the hijackers were Saudi nationals. Americans are waking up to the fact that that the kingdom's dominant Wahabi brand of Islam is especially hostile to the West and Israel, and that Saudi money has funded anti-Western movements, including al-Qaeda, for many years. Some American businessmen have even, very belatedly, realised that the regime in Saudi Arabia is sexist, racist and barbarous to a degree the West would not tolerate elsewhere. But at least they are having the debate, which appears not to have crossed the radar screen of British business at all. Set against the serious issue of whether we should do business at all with a state as quintessentially rotten as Saudi Arabia, the intrigue between the SFO, BAE and MoD really is, in the words of BAE chief Mike Turner, 'old hat'. RSA death throes The city is always blathering about the laws of free markets and how the share price reflects intrinsic value. Now, with the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance rights issue, comes the chance for the Square Mile to show that some companies deserve to go to the wall. For an insurer to ask shareholders for nearly \u00a31 billion in the current climate is stretching it, however good the management or record might be. For RSA to do so now, against a background of strategic mismanagement and bombed-out markets, runs the risk of an investor boycott that could seriously damage the whole sector. The threat of an RSA overhang was enough to wallop most insurers' shares last week. Sentiment is most hostile in the US, where ADR holders are against the issue. Some of the funds from the rights will go to improve the financial position in America so the business can be sold, which seems like a unique waste of shareholders' cash. The underwriters look sure to be left with a large chunk of the issue, ensuring that RSA's pangs are painfully drawn out. But given the rescue-rights strategy, there seems to be no alternative to this slow, lingering death. The advisers deserve to be dumped on their rumps. Kenyon's blues I must confess I don't really understand why Roman Abramovich hired Peter Kenyon as Chelsea's new chief executive. It is said that the Russian wants Kenyon to market Chelsea across the world in the same way he did with Manchester United, and open doors to the corridors of power within Uefa and Fifa. Kenyon has had some limited success in making United a global brand, but it has always been the biggest, most glamorous name in English football and has had a big international following for years. It's hard to see him repeating the trick with plain old Chelsea any time soon. You have to wonder also how far Kenyon's ability to wheel and deal in the smoke-filled rooms of world football was simply because he represented United, rather than because he was 'Cuddly Pete'. Will the same football power brokers return his calls when he's phoning for the Blues, regardless of their Russian billions? And as for wanting Chelsea to be run along solid commercial lines, well, that defeats the object. Why have a Russian sugar-daddy if all you want to do is make a profit? Any return Kenyon could make for Chelsea would be meaningless alongside Abramovich's millions. Of course, if Chelsea takes the Premiership and Europe by storm, Kenyon's job will be much easier. But at the moment the only plausible reason for his appointment is that Chelsea knew it would sow confusion and uncertainty at Old Trafford. As the bid fever mounts at United, it has certainly done that. Matt finish It will be regrettable, in some ways, if Matt Barrett has to leave Barclays rather than step up to the chairmanship. He gave the bank a brighter image and brushed out some of the cobwebbed bureaucracy that went with its heritage. But he failed to set Barclays on any radically new course, and ultimately surrendered in the oldest rivalry in British banking, the war between Barclays and NatWest - even if NatWest had to sell itself to the Scots to achieve final victory. But the rules of corporate governance have changed. It is no longer acceptable for chief execs to move into the chair. It would be unforgiveable for so eminent an institution as Barclays to put a finger up to corporate governance, so Barrett has to go. Perversely, if he hadn't been chief executive, he is exactly the kind of man the bank should now be considering for the chairmanship. Gardner leave Final word on football, United, Russians et al: Where has Roy Gardner, chairman of the United plc, been all week? His chief executive is stolen from beneath his nose, the share price takes a walloping and the shareholders are left in the dark. Yet the chairman has not uttered a peep in public. The word is that his day-job, utilities group Centrica, is none too happy with the high profile required of a Manchester United chairman, and reminded him emphatically who pays the wages. It wouldn't have happened under Professor Roland Smith, that's for sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
