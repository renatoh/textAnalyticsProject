Ministers said the moves would \u201cput cash back into the pockets of future homeowners\u201d and prevent them from being trapped in \u201cexploitative arrangements\u201d. The announcement follows an official consultation held in the wake of widespread outrage about unfair abuses of the leasehold system. It was part of a package of measures unveiled on Thursday that also included proposals to make it easier for private tenants to transfer deposits directly between landlords when moving home. There are about 4.2m residential leasehold properties in England, of which about 2.9m are flats, and the government first outlined plans for a clampdown in this area in July 2017. This followed reports that tens of thousands of homebuyers had been saddled with spiralling ground rents which had in some cases left homes virtually unsaleable. Fees of up to \u00a32,500 were demanded by some freeholders for permission to build an extension, and some homeowners have been asked for up to \u00a335,000 to buy freeholds on recently built detached houses with long leaseholds. James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, said the government was pushing ahead with axing leaseholds for all new houses, which would in future be sold as freehold unless there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. Flats can continue to be sold as leasehold but ministers said they would reduce ground rents on future leases to zero, as opposed to an earlier proposal to cap them at a nominal \u00a310 per year \u2013 down from the current average of about \u00a3300. Meanwhile, to stop freeholders and managing agents taking as long as they want \u2013 and charging what they want \u2013 to provide leaseholders with the information they need to sell their home, ministers will introduce a new time limit of 15 working days and a maximum fee of \u00a3200. The government said contracts relating to the help-to-buy scheme would be renegotiated to explicitly rule out the selling of new leasehold houses, other than in exceptional circumstances, to protect homebuyers from unscrupulous charges. In addition, where buyers were incorrectly sold a leasehold home, consumers would be able to obtain their freehold outright at no extra cost. However, it is not clear when the measures will formally take effect. Brokenshire said the government would be \u201cpressing ahead as soon as parliamentary time allows\u201d. Meanwhile, ministers said that when some private tenants moved home, they found it a struggle to come up with a second deposit for their new landlord, so the government wanted to create a system that would allow someone\u2019s deposit cash \u201cto follow them from property to property\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
