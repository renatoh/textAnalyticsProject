While she assures me she\u2019s improving, working with her \u201cunpredictable\u201d co-star Melissa McCarthy on their new movie Spy made it almost impossible. \u201cShe\u2019ll go on these runs of her bits, so it\u2019s pretty hard not to start laughing. Even the crew guys start laughing.\u201d She adds quickly: \u201cJude [Law] broke a lot so that made me feel less self-conscious.\u201d For Byrne, it\u2019s an occupational hazard. The Sydney-born actor has made a slew of comedies since her 2010 role as trashtastic popstar Jackie Q, the girlfriend of Russell Brand\u2019s character in Get Him to the Greek. Next came the wildly successful Bridesmaids, in which she played the insufferable Helen opposite Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, followed by the bromance Bad Neighbours, in which she played Seth Rogen\u2019s wife and casually walked away with most of the kudos. Her fast track to funny girl is no accident. When I interviewed Byrne in 2010, before Greek, she spoke of a desire to do more comedy after a run of solemn-faced roles in the Asperger\u2019s drama Adam, the horror flick 28 Weeks Later and the sci-fi thriller Sunshine. She said then: \u201cMost of my stuff has been serious \u2026 but I definitely have a light-hearted side.\u201d She has channelled it. Spy reunites her with the Bridesmaids director, Paul Feig, and co-star McCarthy. Billed as an action comedy, the film sees McCarthy\u2019s mild-mannered CIA analyst Susan Cooper forced out into the field \u2013 in increasingly depressing cat-lady disguises \u2013 to stop an underworld nuclear arms deal. Byrne plays the dastardly Raina Boyanov, a mob boss\u2019s daughter who is possibly the linchpin in the deal and the foil for McCarthy\u2019s unfortunate character. The two banter and bounce off each other, locked in a tussle of wits and, occasionally, limbs. Despite her growing assuredness, she finds comedy challenging, particularly when working with \u201ceffortless\u201d performers such as Wiig, Rudolph and McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s like doing a drama but on top of that you have to get a laugh,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s scientific, it\u2019s technical and it\u2019s also like lightning in a bottle.\u201d Her approach is different to that of her co-stars: \u201cI could never do standup \u2013 my comedy comes from character stuff, not necessarily from jokes.\u201d What makes her laugh in real life? \u201cFox news. That\u2019s pretty funny.\u201d At 35, Byrne is one of Australia\u2019s most successful actors. Audiences have watched her transform from the fresh-faced (albeit peroxided) 20-year-old in Two Hands, opposite Heath Ledger, through a blink-and-you-missed-it performance in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, a screen kiss with Brad Pitt in the forgettable Troy and a role as the extravagant Duchesse de Polignac in Sofia Coppola\u2019s lightweight Marie Antoinette. Then came Damages, her breakout television role in which she played a law school graduate locked in a dysfunctional relationship with her mentor/tormentor, played by Glenn Close. The show premiered in 2007, the same year as Mad Men, and was one of the new breed of TV dramas, headed up by strong female leads. It ran for five seasons. Looking back, Byrne says she realises it was a seminal time: \u201cI was lucky to be part of that really great writing that was returning to TV.\u201d The role got her noticed \u2013 and two Golden Globe nominations. By 2013 she was one of LA\u2019s most in-demand actors, reportedly having her pick of TV scripts during pilot season. Instead she focused on getting her funny on. While more likely to be cracking a smile on screen, she\u2019s getting more serious off screen. Until recently, Byrne could never have been accused of being outspoken but in 2014 she appeared in a public service announcement on US television about sexual assaults on college campuses. Inspired by the campaign, she followed it up by taking part in a women\u2019s day at the UN in New York. \u201cI thought it was a really hard subject to discuss that nobody really wants to.\u201d She\u2019s also entered the debate about sexism in the film industry. Byrne points to a push by the American Civil Liberties Union for a criminal investigation into gender discrimination. \u201cIt\u2019s not being put down to good old-fashioned misogyny, it\u2019s actually [asking] why is this quietly tolerated? Why has this been a silent agreement for the last however many years. \u201cThis is discrimination. And that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s very interesting, long overdue and quite frankly exciting to see it being taken as seriously as it should be.\u201d Byrne and a group of close friends have taken matters into their own hands. Documentary film-maker Gracie Otto, actor and writer Krew Boylan, director Shannon Murphy, publicist Jessica Carrera and Byrne decided to band together to form the Dollhouse Collective, a production company with an emphasis on creating \u201ccomplicated great lead roles for women\u201d. The fivesome intend to mix and match duties, with Byrne keen to produce and direct. \u201cAs an actor, you have little control over your career, whereas you can exercise a little bit more of that when you are steering the ship.\u201d She feels a responsibility to Australia. \u201cYou want to give back, to tell Australian stories and nurture the place where you are from.\u201d She won\u2019t say if the newly announced Screen Australia funding cuts will affect the company\u2019s first project Seriously Red, written by Boyland and executive produced by Byrne. But she was disappointed to hear about them. \u201cIt just seems to be more bad news with this government with the arts. It\u2019s not a priority for them to cultivate our storytelling or our culture through artistic pursuits.\u201d Still, she continues to enjoy the lighter side of her work. She\u2019s pleased when I point out red carpet shots in which she looks increasingly chipper. \u201cI\u2019m used to people telling me I was miserable so it\u2019s nice to have a change of tune.\u201d Time to press her for a reason. Is it her increasingly comedic roles that are making her smile? Her confidence as a red carpet regular? Or perhaps the happiness she\u2019s reportedly found with her partner, actor Bobby Cannavale? She laughs hard. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve had a few glasses of wine before I got on there, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d \u2022 Spy is out now in Australia and released on 5 June in the US and UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
