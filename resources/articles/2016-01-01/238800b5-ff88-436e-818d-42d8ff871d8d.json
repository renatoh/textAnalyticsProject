The 18-year-old Sheyi Ojo became the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup history and Jo\u00e3o Carlos Teixeira was also on the scoresheet in the 3-0 victory as Klopp\u2019s makeshift side secured a fourth-round tie at home to West Ham United. Joe Allen opened the scoring and Jon Flanagan ended his 20-month injury nightmare with a second-half substitute\u2019s appearance. The Liverpool manager was fulsome in his praise of the club\u2019s young players, with the midfielders Kevin Stewart and Cameron Brannagan also impressing, but insisted patience was required before they could be considered for the Premier League. \u201cOjo is very young, everyone can see he has big skills but there are also a lot of things he has to work on,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe made a goal that wasn\u2019t too bad. He came on in the last game and was important in the draw. He\u2019s on a good way but it is a long way to go for all the boys. They showed what they are able to do and showed what they still have to learn. Now it is about giving the lads time to develop, not protecting them. \u201cIt was a really enjoyable night for football and the lads enjoyed it, you could see that. They worked hard, created chances, scored wonderful goals and made mistakes but worked hard to correct those mistakes. There are a lot of things to learn. The target at the end of the road is Liverpool FC in the Premier League and for this you have to be ready in all parts of development.\u201d Paul Tisdale, the Exeter manager, said he was both proud of the League Two side\u2019s run in the FA Cup \u2013 worth \u00a3500,000 to the club from the third round alone \u2013 but frustrated that his team \u201ctook too long to get going. But I shouldn\u2019t be too downbeat tonight.\u201d Flanagan\u2019s first appearance since May 2014 prompted a tweet from Brazil\u2019s World Cup winning captain Cafu, to whom the Liverpool right back was compared prior to his knee problems. \u201cI have a thousand tweets! I guess it\u2019s the return of a friend to the field!!! @LFC\u201d wrote the Brazilian on Twitter. Klopp said: \u201cThat was an emotional moment. Nobody deserved it more than Flanno. He has been injured a long time and injured since I came here but he has never been in a bad mood. He\u2019s a really strong lad. We have to take it day-by-day with him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
