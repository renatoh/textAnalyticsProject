Grays took the lead through Lee Matthews, his first goal for the club. Andy Bishop scored two as second-placed York romped to a 4-2 home win over Exeter. Steve Flack had struck to make it 1-1 for the visitors, before Bryan Stewart and Donaldson put York ahead again. Billy Jones then scored from the spot to give Exeter hope, but Bishop struck his second. Woking also netted four, including a Justin Richards hat-trick, for no reply over a depleted Scarborough. Craig McAllister got the fourth. Gravesend drew 1-1 away to Accrington, with a second-half strike from Onome Sodje. The striker, on loan from Charlton, came off the bench to cancel Ian Craney's opener. Bruno Teixeira's lob from 35 yards was enough to earn Forest Green a home victory against Morecambe. Goalkeeper Ryan Clarke saved from Danny Carlton to prevent the visitors going ahead and four minutes from time, he pulled off a double save from Michael Twiss to take the points. At the other end of the table, Tamworth climbed off the bottom thanks to Carl Heggs, who scored the only goal of the game away to Kidderminster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
