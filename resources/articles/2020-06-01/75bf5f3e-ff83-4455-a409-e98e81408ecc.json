The extreme speeds were not confined to motorways, as drivers also took the drop in traffic as an invitation to break the law on urban roads, thus endangering lives, police said. The highest speed recorded was 163mph on the M1 in London, 93 miles over the speed limit, according to the Metropolitan police\u2019s lead on road safety, Det Supt Andy Cox. That driver was in a Porsche but Cox said offenders were spotted in all types of vehicles, from across all demographics, and in all speed zones. He urged drivers to think of the dangers to \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d during a period when people were being urged by Boris Johnson to avoid public transport and instead to walk or cycle to work. Police data obtained by the RAC through freedom of information requests revealed that the second highest speed recorded in early lockdown was 151mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, and the third 140mph on the A14 in Suffolk. RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the speeds as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and warned that motorists travelling this fast have \u201cvirtually no time to react should anything unexpected happen\u201d. He went on: \u201cSome drivers have taken advantage of quieter roads to speed excessively, putting the lives of others at risk at the worst possible time. It\u2019s encouraging that so many police forces have taken firm action even during the lockdown, which sends a strong message to other would-be offenders.\u201d Five other forces detected motorists driving at more than 130mph. Cox, the Met\u2019s lead for its Vision Zero initiative to eliminate deaths on the roads, said his team caught a driver doing 134mph in a 40mph zone in Enfield. Tracking cameras showed driving speeds in London were \u201cabove the limit on average in all categories from the first part of lockdown to early May\u201d, he added. Data for May showed a tenfold increase in the number of enforcements in the 20mph zone, with 530 drivers caught breaking the limit, compared with just 50 in 2019. There were more than double the number of offences in the 30mph zone, and a near eightfold increase in speeding in the 60mph zones. The figures relate to physical interventions by officers and do not include data from speed cameras. Local councils have also been concerned, warning that speed limits did not change with empty roads. As schools reopen and more people return to work without using public transport, police are urging people to shun drivers who speed, saying it is the single biggest contributor to fatalities in the capital. \u201cI can\u2019t say the increase is a surprise, because we see reckless driving all the time. Too often people say this is about revenue-raising \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you catch some real criminals?\u2019 \u2013 which is offensive to me and my team because we have seen what happens when there are life-changing injuries or deaths and how lives are wrecked. \u201cThere has to be a change in social attitudes. In the last 25 years, drink-driving has become socially unacceptable. People won\u2019t get into a car when someone has been drinking, they will take the keys from friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not happening with speeding. The problem is these drivers or their friends don\u2019t understand how dangerous it is, don\u2019t think we will be there or they will caught, or that they will be the ones in an accident.\u201d He said the people caught speeding were likely to be those that would do so anyway but \u201csaw more opportunity in lockdown as the roads were quieter\u201d. Department for Transport figures show traffic was down by two-thirds in the first few weeks of lockdown.
