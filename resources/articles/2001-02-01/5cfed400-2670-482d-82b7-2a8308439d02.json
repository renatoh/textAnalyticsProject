But pressure mounted from critics in the Labour and Liberal Democrat ranks - along with the Law Society and other supporters of legal modernisation - who seized on the controversy to argue for reform of the lord chancellor's dual role as a politician who also heads the judicial system and appoints QCs and judges. Robert Stevens, master of Pembroke College, Oxford, said that the affair underlined \"the fact that you can't have the same person as head of the judiciary, a cabinet minister and responsible for all preferments\". A member of a committee of legal peers and academics which has called for a independent body to oversee appointments, Mr Stevens added: \"If Tony Blair is committed to modernisation he needs to have a head of the judiciary who is not a politician and he needs to have a judicial appointments committee. \"Then if your minister of justice wants to have a party and shake people down for money, that's fine.\" Lord Lester, a human rights QC and Liberal Democrat peer, called Lord Irvine's letter \"politically naive.\" He said: \"As the Book of Matthew teaches us, no man should serve two masters and Derry [Irvine] serves at least two masters if not three or four. \"His politically naive decision may be important in highlighting the need to reform his domain when he's been busy reforming everybody else's.\" But he dismissed Conservative calls for the lord chancellor's resignation and accused the Tories of \"making capital out of his unwisdom\". In the hope of reviving the sleaze issue ahead of the general election with what they dubbed the \"cash for wigs\" affair, the Tories demanded the names of all lawyers attending the controversial free dinner. They also wrote to Lord Neill, the chairman of the committee on standards in public life, seeking an investigation. When it emerged last week that Lord Irvine had solicited \"at least \u00a3200\" donations from lawyers attending the fundraising dinner with Cherie Booth QC, senior Tory lawyers privately joined the widespread condemnation: the action was foolish, but not warranting his resignation from the cabinet, they agreed. But yesterday they performed a u-turn, ostensibly because Downing Street had given what Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, himself a barrister, called \"a contemptuous brush-off\" to concerns voiced about Lord Irvine's patronage powers to appoint the very lawyers at the dinner to be QCs or judges. Lord Lester branded \"constitutionally illiterate\" a statement from the prime minister's spokesman that there was no difference between the lord chancellor hosting a fundraising dinner and the prime minister acting as host. Attempts to raise the issue in the Lords yesterday were rebuffed. And Mr Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, accused the media and the Tories of using the row to \"avoid real debate on policy and the issues that matter to people\". The resignation call would be treated by Mr Blair \"with the contempt it deserves\", he said. Undeterred, Mr Ancram issued a direct challenge to Mr Blair, once a pupil in Lord Irvine's chambers. He wrote: \"I believe that Lord Irvine's actions in soliciting money from lawyers have breached the trust placed in him and brought the integrity of the lord chancellor's office into question. \"As you have failed to provide any satisfactory reply to the allegations and failed to acknowledge any appearance of impropriety on the lord chancellor's part, I am now calling on you now to consider Lord Irvine's position as head of the judiciary.\" The Scottish National party backed the Tories. Lord Lester voiced concerns, also expressed by Labour QCs such as Bob Marshall-Andrews, about Lord Irvine's dual functions as a powerful cabinet policy maker and arbitrator (he played a key role in Peter Mandelson's fall) as well as impartial head of the judiciary. The roles should be separated into a justice department and an appointments panel, reformers say. Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?
