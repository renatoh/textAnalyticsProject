Inside the illustrious Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise", "bodyText": "Companies like nothing more than to refer to themselves, unironically, as families. The actors of Paris\u2019s Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise have a better claim than most, however: for starters, directors keep casting them as fratricidal dynasties. Just this season, the oldest active theatre troupe in the world has portrayed a tribe pushed to the brink in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Fanny and Alexander; the murderous siblings Electra and Orestes; and the Essenbecks, the wealthy Nazi-era family that comes undone in The Damned. Now London audiences will get to see some of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s star performers lock horns, too. This week, The Damned, staged by Ivo van Hove and based on Luchino Visconti\u2019s 1969 film, will open at London\u2019s Barbican. It is the French company\u2019s first UK tour in nearly two decades. The production is hardly traditional, with spare sets and extensive live filming, yet as an intergenerational tragedy, it hits the mark chillingly. It\u2019s a fitting vehicle for the singular, self-managed troupe, where the actors are the main stakeholders. \u201cNo one really knows this house,\u201d suggests Christophe Montenez, who joined five years ago and plays the decadent Martin von Essenbeck in The Damned. \u201cPeople are fascinated, scared \u2013 they think it\u2019s a nest of vipers or the Atreides\u201d (in Greek mythology, the less-than-peaceful family of Electra and Orestes). I\u2019m assured by everyone I meet that this is an old-fashioned idea. \u201cIt really is a family,\u201d Montenez says, unprompted. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise certainly boasts an impressive ancestry. Based at the Salle Richelieu, near the Louvre, the company has weathered over three centuries of artistic and political storms. In the hallway next to the office of the current director, Eric Ruf, known as the administrator, a list of 51 names is carved into a marble wall. They represent every Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise dean (an important office, held by the longest-serving company member) since 1658. The first is none other than the playwright Moli\u00e8re \u2013 an honorary father figure, since the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise was officially born in 1680, the fusion of his troupe and another. \u201cSometimes young directors who come in think: that\u2019s nice, but I have my own collective,\u201d says Ruf, a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor and set designer appointed administrator in 2014. \u201cI tell them that they\u2019re going to work with the oldest collective in the world. If you like to direct people who know each other, well, we\u2019ve played lovers, siblings, cousins, we\u2019ve sweated and been naked on stage together.\u201d As we sit around a large table covered in notes and documents for an upcoming production of Brecht\u2019s Life of Galileo, Ruf\u2019s deep, melodious voice strikes me anew. After joining the company in 1993, he spent two decades acting in everything from Moli\u00e8re and Victor Hugo to Tennessee Williams, and it shows: he phrases his answers with warm elegance and the odd literary flourish. \u201cThe administrator who hired me said that a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor is an operator of the verb, and I like that idea,\u201d he says. The company\u2019s reverence for texts makes it an outlier in contemporary French theatre. For the past few decades, experimental directors have received the lion\u2019s share of attention in the country, and steered critical attention away from a play\u2019s integrity. As the last permanent troupe in France, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise plays a vital role in passing down the craft that goes into performing French dramatic verse, from Racine\u2019s hieratic alexandrines to Paul Claudel\u2019s free verse. To this day, the literary merit of every play that joins the repertoire is assessed by a reading committee, although the rules have been relaxed to allow adaptations such as The Damned. It isn\u2019t the only seemingly quaint house tradition. Company members are split into two groups, the pensionnaires and the soci\u00e9taires. Pensionnaires such as Montenez are hired by the administrator on one-year contracts, while the 39 soci\u00e9taires are seasoned actors who own stakes in the troupe. Every artist\u2019s performance is reviewed yearly by a committee composed of the administrator, the dean and eight soci\u00e9taires, who have the power to let their peers go and to promote the pensionnaires. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, but it\u2019s better to have the opinion of 10 people than just one person,\u201d says Claude Mathieu, the current dean, who trained with the legendary French director Antoine Vitez before joining in 1979. \u201cOtherwise, like every other company, it would be made up of the director\u2019s own actors.\u201d Some dismissals still make headlines, not least when they involve popular performers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the actor: it\u2019s also the soci\u00e9taire, the person. An older company member who can\u2019t stand the younger ones may be an issue.\u201d The cliche of the airhead actor doesn\u2019t fly at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. The board is composed entirely of soci\u00e9taires, who approve the budget and other strategic decisions. If a company member misses a performance without a good reason, he or she must pay the lost box-office revenue, and the repertoire system is intense, with several productions on at once. \u201cBefore I joined, the stage had a sacred aspect for me. I had a lot of rituals, I would put on a lot of creams,\u201d the 30-year-old Montenez says with a laugh. \u201cHere, you\u2019re on so much that you develop an instinct on stage.\u201d It\u2019s a utopian model that may well be on trend again, as the egalitarian theatre collectives that have sprung up in France in recent years suggest. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s motto is \u201cSimul et singulis\u201d \u2013 together yet individual. \u201cThere was a stronger hierarchy when I first joined, but productions are collective efforts these days. Everyone is equal, whether you\u2019re 25 or 70 years old,\u201d Mathieu explains. \u201cA lazy actor is going to have a hard time. We have a joke: you\u2019re very singulis at the moment, you\u2019re just thinking about yourself!\u201d The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise continues to produce its fair share of stars. Among the cast of The Damned, Denis Podalyd\u00e8s and Guillaume Gallienne are household names in France, with film careers on the side. Elsa Lepoivre, who plays Sophie von Essenbeck, is widely considered one of the finest stage actors of her generation. Montenez is only the latest to make a name for himself, with a TV series in the works. This actor-led setup means the administrator has less power than most artistic directors, despite being responsible for programming. The system favours insiders who can navigate the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s checks and balances, and after a slow start, Ruf\u2019s leadership has blossomed into a steady success. Prestigious international directors, from Van Hove to Thomas Ostermeier, have made their house debuts, while Ruf has initiated a push for more diversity, on stage and in the wings. His rule of gender parity among the directors working across the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s three stages is especially meaningful in France, where there is still resistance to any serious examination of institutional sexism. When I tell him he is setting an example, he replies with characteristic measure. \u201cI\u2019m lucky: there are plenty of impressive female directors in the younger generation. Some tell me it\u2019s not enough, that there aren\u2019t enough women on the main stage. I agree, but I don\u2019t want to set quotas, I want to do things intelligently. It\u2019s not easy to harness the Salle Richelieu: it can burn someone.\u201d The administrator sees racial diversity on stage as an even longer game. Despite a couple of recent hires, the company remains overwhelmingly white, with limited turnover. When Ruf cast Ga\u00ebl Kalimindi, a black actor, as the son of the blond Elsa Lepoivre in Hugo\u2019s Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia, there was some pushback from within the institution. \u201cThe audience doesn\u2019t care, but some professionals still tell me: yes, but if the mother is white \u2026\u201d Ruf\u2019s contract is up in August, but if it is renewed for a second five-year term, as is highly likely, he will steward the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise through another momentous transition. In 2024, the company is scheduled to swap its two smaller stages (the Studio-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, underneath the Louvre Pyramid, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier) for a pair of newly built ones at the Cit\u00e9 du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, a multipurpose site currently being renovated in the north of Paris. The larger, more flexible auditoriums should bring in much-needed additional revenue, since the institution\u2019s annual public grant of \u20ac24.5m hasn\u2019t kept up with its labour costs (around \u20ac29m). There will be challenges ahead for France\u2019s premier theatre family on that front, but in the meantime, Ruf would be grateful if everyone stopped asking how he intends to rejuvenate the supposedly \u201cdusty\u201d institution. \u201cThere is an anchor in our longevity, a weightiness that can be fertile. If this company has been active since 1680, isn\u2019t it somewhat exemplary?\u201d \u2022 The Damned is at the Barbican, London, 19-25 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
