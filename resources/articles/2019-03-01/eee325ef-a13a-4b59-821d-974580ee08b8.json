Both the US president\u2019s son and Bolton attacked British political leadership after Theresa May said she would ask the EU for a delay to the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union; in line with parliament\u2019s wish. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Trump Jr said May should have listened to his father\u2019s advice over Brexit, saying that a \u201cprocess that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo\u201d. According to the prime minister, Trump advised her to \u201csue the EU \u2013 not go into negotiations\u201d. And, speaking to Sky News, Bolton accused UK politicians of failing to \u201cgive effect\u201d to the Brexit referendum result. The UK has invoked article 50 \u2013 the formal process by which it can leave the EU \u2013 but is seeking a delay, after the terms upon which it would exit the bloc could not be agreed by parliament. Bolton added: \u201cThe president has been clear that he wants a resolution of this issue that allows the United States and Britain to come to trade deals again. He sees huge opportunity if Britain\u2019s status can be resolved.\u201d Last week, the US president said he was \u201csurprised at how badly\u201d the Brexit negotiations had gone for the UK, but added at that point: \u201cI think we will stay right in our lane.\u201d Trump, who has sought to tear up many of the US\u2019s existing trade agreements and seek terms he sees as more favourable to Washington, has previously said May\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement \u201csounds like a great deal for the EU\u201d and could prevent the UK from pursuing closer trade ties with the US. Earlier this month, it was reported that Trump had met the hard-Brexiter and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who hinted that the US president was supportive of the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place. Concerns have been expressed about the UK being forced to lower food safety standards in order to secure a free trade deal with the US post-Brexit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
