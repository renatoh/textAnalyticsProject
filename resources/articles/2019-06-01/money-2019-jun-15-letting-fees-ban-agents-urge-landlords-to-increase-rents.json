Just two weeks after the ban came into force, a north London lettings agent has started telling its landlords to raise all future rents by \u00a320 a month to offset the new costs they face. And it is unlikely to be alone in proposing such a measure. The move, which was this week branded by one landlord as \u201cnot in the spirit of the law\u201d, had been predicted by some commentators, though few thought it would happen this quickly. Letting agent body Arla Propertymark warned in May that rents would rise by \u00a3103 a year as agents and landlords sought to recoup lost revenue. It now expects other agents to quickly follow suit, it said this week. At the start of June the government outlawed the \u00a3300-plus admin fees, the \u00a3100 credit-check fees and a host of often ludicrous charges that had become the bane of tenants\u2019 lives. They could easily add \u00a3600-\u00a3800 to the upfront cost of renting a property. While tenant groups celebrated the ban, it was accompanied by threats from the property industry that rents would have to rise. It emerged this week that award-winning London letting agent Simon Clarke has been writing to its landlords with the increased rent proposal. The company, which has been in business since 1991 and has offices in Finchley and Whetstone, is to start charging landlords \u00a3240 for credit and other checks \u2013 on top of its existing fees. Prior to the ban, it charged tenants \u00a3432 for the same service. An online tenant credit check can be done for about \u00a320. The letter seen by Money states: \u201cAssuming you would like us to continue to fully reference and credit check prospective new tenants as and when your property becomes available, we need to inform you that an additional admin charge of \u00a3200 plus VAT known as a \u2018tenancy set-up fee\u2019 will be levied \u2026 and in addition to the letting fee. This is to cover the cost of this essential referencing service moving forward and shall include the right to rent immigration checks.\u201d The company, which already charges landlords a 9.6% lettings fee, with a further 6% if they want the let managed, goes on to say: \u201cWe are very aware this is a cost which you perhaps have not accounted for and therefore what we propose is a small increase in the monthly rental figure to absorb the effects of this charge. This means increasing your rent by \u00a320 per month, and this is something we will do before we list the property \u2018to let\u2019.\u201d The landlord who contacted us to reveal Simon Clarke\u2019s letter says he will resist the agent\u2019s move to increase the rent. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is in the spirit of the legislation. There is little transparency in the fees, and I have little idea of how much the letting agents actually pay for credit checks, referencing etc. I\u2019d rather that I, as a landlord, bear the brunt of these charges, not the tenant,\u201d he says. A spokesperson for Simon Clarke told Money: \u201cWith the introduction of the tenant fees ban, we have had to pass on our costs for setting up a tenancy. In this time of increased regulation, particularly the recent rises in landlord taxation, we have advised our clients on how to ensure they can still cover the costs of their rental properties.\u201d The agent also asked Arla chief executive David Cox to speak to us. \u201cWhen the ban came in, we warned that rents would rise on average by \u00a3103 a year. What we have seen this week is what we predicted would happen \u2026 This is set to happen across the board,\u201d he said. Cox pointed to research undertaken for Arla by the consultancy Capital Economics that revealed the fees ban is set to cost letting agents \u00a3200m a year, and landlords \u00a3300m. It also claimed that 4,000 letting agent jobs could be lost. Dan Wilson Craw, director at campaign group Generation Rent, says it is interesting that this agent is not attempting to pass on to landlords the full \u00a3432 sum it used to charge tenants. \u201cExisting tenants aren\u2019t affected \u2013 rightly, because there are no costs involved when there\u2019s no change to whose name is on the contract,\u201d he says. \u201cAs for the attempt to increase rent by \u00a320 a month, whether this is possible depends entirely on the wider market \u2013 a shortage of homes sees rents go up anyway, but if the landlord is competing with newly built flats, they might struggle to get new tenants in at the higher rent.\u201d In January the Guardian reported that rents across Britain fell in 2018 for the first time in a decade, after years of inflation-busting rises. Figures from the Deposit Protection Service \u2013 a government-backed group that supervises tenancy deposits \u2013 showed that the average rent fell by \u00a39 \u2013 from \u00a3774 in 2017 to \u00a3765. Reduced demand from tenants in places such as London, in part due to Brexit, was cited as a factor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
