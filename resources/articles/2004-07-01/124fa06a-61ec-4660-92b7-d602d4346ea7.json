A specialist has delivered the shattering verdict after Senegal international Faye failed a medical on his right knee having agreed a \u00a33million move to Fulham. At first, Portsmouth claimed he had merely changed his mind about the transfer opportunity and decided to stay at Fratton Park. Redknapp eventually admitted the player had been sent back to him but hoped Faye would get through the problem after a month's rest. Faye's knee suffered whilst playing in a series of Senegalese internationals at the end of last season. Redknapp, who is now being linked with a \u00a33 million bid for West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick, said: \"It is a big blow even though we knew Amdy would be out for a spell. Now I've lost two cracking midfield players with (Alexei) Smertin going back to Chelsea.\" Faye made 31 appearances for Pompey last season and was believed to be the club's third highest earner behind Teddy Sheringham and Patrik Berger. To add the club's midfield woes they also lost out in the race to sign another Senegal international, Papa Diop. Fulham managed to acquire Diop's services in mid week. Chairman Milan Mandaric refused to give Faye a pay-rise when Fulham came in for him and was furious when the injury problem was revealed, calling on FIFA to ensure that countries paid the wages of players whom were crocked on international duty. Mandaric said: \"Amdy played seven times for Senegal while he was away and that is unbelievable. He came back injured and yet we still have to pay his salary. I think that is one of the most unfair things in football. \"There is an issue in football world-wide here and it has to be resolved. FIFA need to handle it because they make a lot of money out of international tournaments.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
