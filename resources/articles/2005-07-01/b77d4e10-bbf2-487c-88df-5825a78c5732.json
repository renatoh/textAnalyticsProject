Statistics can be abused or misrepresented, so let us be clear from the start: direct responsibility for these criminal atrocities lies with their perpetrators - the four men named by police and any others who were involved in carefully laid plans to commit mass murder against blameless civilians far from any war zone. Yet for anyone but the most blinkered defender of government policy, it is common sense to say that the war increased the risk that Islamist terrorists would target this country. As the respected Chatham House thinktank commented on Monday in a report remarkable only for stating the blindingly obvious:\"The situation over Iraq has imposed particular difficulties for the UK. It gives a boost to the al-Qaida network's propaganda, recruitment and fundraising.\" There is no disagreement on this in Whitehall, where the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre concluded last month: \"Events in Iraq are continuing to act as motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist-related activity in the UK.\" To insist, as Tony Blair, Jack Straw and John Reid all have, that there is no connection whatsoever between Baghdad and Beeston is ridiculous. Mr Straw sounded silly, roping in a weekend bomb attack on western tourists in Turkey as evidence of a global terrorist menace that justified the war. He might as well have thrown in the Real IRA or the Animal Liberation Front. Of course, as the government points out, there were terror attacks before the invasion in March 2003, on tourists in Bali, for example, as there were in Kenya and Tanzania before the assault on the US in 2001. Osama bin Laden's threats against \"crusaders and Jews\" date back to his infamous fatwa of 1998. None of that, though, negates the self-evident truth that Mr Blair, \"riding pillion\" on George Bush's motorbike, as Chatham House put it, has exposed Britain more than before to al-Qaida's fanatical emnity. Nor does it negate the fact, as Ken Livingstone ventured yesterday, that it suited the west to back bin Laden - then \"just another businessman\" - when he fought the Red Army in Afghanistan. It is not hard to see why the government has reacted so shrilly: there were many warnings that invading Iraq would divert attention and resources away from tackling terrorism and stabilising Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban and al-Qaida, which enjoyed wide international and domestic backing. It is also reasonable to assume that British Muslims might have been more cooperative in helping the authorities monitor extremism had it not been for Falluja, Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. But debate about the link between the war and terrorism is now as sterile as it was predictable from the moment those rucksacks exploded on the Tube. No amount of spin can conceal the fact that Iraq is a bloody mess. Those who sincerely want something better to emerge from the rubble and misery need to look ahead, not back. New figures released by the Iraq Body Count show that nearly 25,000 Iraqis died between the invasion and March 2005 - though since January's elections those who call themselves \"the resistance\" have killed more Iraqis in vicious sectarian attacks than US forces have. It is right to pursue a political strategy to tackle the insurgency and its horrors by ensuring that the hard core of jihadists are isolated from the mass of Sunnis struggling to find their place in a post-Saddam world. As we have argued before, though the Iraqi government is too weak to manage on its own, it could still be useful to draw up a timetable for ending the occupation - as well as spending less time on the blame game about how things came to this terrible pass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
