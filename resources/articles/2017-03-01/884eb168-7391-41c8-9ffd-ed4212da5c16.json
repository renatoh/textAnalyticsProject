The inquiry by MPs, led by a former Conservative children\u2019s minister, Tim Loughton, has found \u201cwildly different approaches\u201d in the ways that councils intervene and how likely they are to take children into care. The report \u2013 shared exclusively with the Guardian \u2013 found that in one part of the country (Blackpool) more than seven times as many children were being taken into care than in another (Richmond in London). It also cited a tenfold difference in the numbers being referred to services in the first place: from 187 per 10,000 children in one area to a massive 1,753 in another. The report, by the all-party parliamentary group for children, also suggested that councils were coping with a spending squeeze by tightening up the criteria by which they classify a child as being in need \u2013 cutting thousands out of the system altogether. One council told MPs that the numbers of children in need was being \u201cgrossly under-reported\u201d because of \u201cthe reality of rapidly rising thresholds that arise from reducing resource\u201d. Loughton said the inquiry had revealed that children\u2019s services were stretched to the limit \u201cand in many cases on the brink\u201d and called on the government to urgently investigate the \u201cextraordinary differentials\u201d. \u201cAny vulnerable child deserves the same protections and interventions wherever he or she lives in the country \u2013 but clearly, from such a huge divergence in outcomes, this is not happening,\u201d he said. Anna Feuchtwang, the chief executive of the National Children\u2019s Bureau, which supported the inquiry, suggested that the result could be children unnecessarily separated from their families. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t adequately fund children\u2019s social care, more children and families will be left to fend for themselves as their problems escalate to crisis point. A system that only steps in once a child is in dire need is both costly and cruel. It means, for example, that children could end up in care or experience abuse when providing support earlier could have kept them with their family,\u201d she said. The report found that differences in demography or resource did not come close to explaining the massive variations. Instead it concluded: \u201cCrucially, local policy decisions are leading directly to stark contrasts in children\u2019s outcomes, including the likelihood that they are taken into care.\u201d One worrying finding was that early intervention was being cut, meaning families were ending up in crises before receiving help. Moreover, councils faced a recruitment nightmare, with one revealing a 57% vacancy rate, forcing heavy reliance on temporary agency staff. The situation has become so acute that a survey carried out by the MPs found that overall 89% of directors of children\u2019s services were finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their statutory duties towards vulnerable children. Loughton warned that the area had become a \u201cCinderella service\u201d because vulnerable children were not seen as \u201ceverybody\u2019s business\u201d while the idea of growing old and needing adult social care was. Asked if he feared a repeat of the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, initially known as Baby P, Loughton argued that cases were happening all the time but not being reported. \u201cWhen I was children\u2019s minister every Monday we went through a list of children who had been attacked or killed and there were terrible cases that didn\u2019t make the headlines. It was two kids a week being killed at the hands of carers,\u201d he said. He said that \u00a31 was being spent on preventative help compared with \u00a34 spent on reactive services, arguing the opposite should be true. The Local Government Association responded by warning that councils faced a \u00a31.9bn funding gap for children\u2019s services by 2020, and said that time was running out to find savings without a \u201clasting impact\u201d on critical services. \u201cCouncils have been warning government for some time that the pressures facing children\u2019s services are rapidly becoming unsustainable, with a combination of government funding cuts and huge increases in demand leaving many areas struggling to cope,\u201d said Cllr Richard Watts, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board. Whatever the pressures, he said, it was important to recognise that social workers continued to provide \u201cheroic levels of support\u201d \u2013 taking tough decisions to save children\u2019s lives. Labour\u2019s shadow children\u2019s minister Emma Lewell-Buck, herself a former social worker, said: \u201cThis report is alarming but sadly not surprising, given how hard the council cuts have hit children\u2019s social care... \u201cInstead of learning the lessons, addressing those failures and protecting services from cuts, the department has focused on a few short-term projects in a few local authorities through the so-called innovation fund. So it is no surprise that this piecemeal approach has led to an even more fragmented and inconsistent service for our most vulnerable children and families.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe want every single child, no matter where they live, to receive the same high quality care and support \u2013 and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver. We are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe, and our new What Works Centre for children\u2019s social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice.\u201d The DfE argued that the department had taken \u201ctough action\u201d where councils were failing children, and was supporting the recruitment and training of social workers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
