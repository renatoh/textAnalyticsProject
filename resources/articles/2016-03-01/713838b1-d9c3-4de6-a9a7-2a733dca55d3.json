After England\u2019s win against Wales there were really only three things the passengers wanted to talk about in between the bursts of Delilah and Swing Low. The first was why England had come so close to blowing the match in the final nine minutes. The second was what a good job Eddie Jones has done since he took charge of the team. And the third was how well Maro Itoje had played. Against Wales, Itoje was a one-man wrecking crew. He spoiled their lineout, smashed holes in their defence and often stopped their runners dead with his tackles. He left England\u2019s fans feeling \u2013 and excuse the quotation on the grounds that Itoje says he likes to write poetry \u2013 \u201clike some watcher of the skies / When a new planet swims into his ken\u201d. Itoje says he\u2019s already regretting that he let slip that little fact about his poetry habit, because of the way in which we in the media have seized on it. \u201cI actually think you guys are overplaying it a bit,\u201d he said on Saturday night. It\u2019s one little detail among a few which get recycled as we try to compile the quick character sketches of the kind that filled many of Sunday\u2019s papers, where he was presented as \u201cSuper-Maro\u201d, \u201cHarrow Maro\u201d, and \u201cSport\u2019s Latest Superstar\u201d. Add to it these others: his parents moved to England from Nigeria, he used to do the shot put, once won a scholarship to Harrow and is now studying for a degree in politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He has spent his spare time while at the England training camp during this Six Nations working on an essay about humanitarian intervention, which he has just handed in. Regular readers of the rugby pages will most likely know all of this already. Itoje has been seen as the coming man ever since 2014, when he was still a teenager playing for Old Albanian. That same year he led England\u2019s Under-20 team to victory at the Junior World Championships, and also made his Premiership debut. By the end of the year he was captaining Saracens too, in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. Then, in 2015, Itoje was called into England\u2019s preliminary squad for the World Cup. So he has gone from playing National One to the Six Nations in the space of two years. Despite that, he says he doesn\u2019t think his rise has \u201cbeen that fast, if I\u2019m honest\u201d. In fact: \u201cI think other players have done it quicker so I don\u2019t feel my progress has been any more special than anyone else\u2019s.\u201d Perhaps not, from where he\u2019s standing. The last England player who was subject to such fanfare so young was Danny Cipriani, who was 20 when he made his England debut against Wales in 2008, a year younger than Itoje is now. Eight years later, Cipriani has made all of four starts for the team and won a total of 14 caps, the last of which came prior to the 2015 World Cup, for which he was not selected. There are plenty of reasons why Cipriani, who is still one of the most gifted players in England, failed to carve out an international career for himself. His character would be one, and the way he was managed another. But the hype certainly didn\u2019t help him. Which is why Eddie Jones has, in his own peculiar way, been doing his best to protect Itoje from the press\u2019s attentions and the public\u2019s expectations. Even if the way in which Jones has gone about it has left Itoje a little perplexed. He admitted he had to use Google to find out exactly what Jones meant by comparing him to a Vauxhall Viva. Vauxhall stopped making them in 1979, 15 years before Itoje was born. Jones was right to try to push back against the hype. As he says, he has \u201ca duty of care\u201d. Trouble is, everyone loves to build a young player up. It seems to be an almost irresistible urge. And even those who should know better feel the need to indulge it. Jones\u2019s own defence coach, Paul Gustard, has said he hopes Itoje could be as good as Paul O\u2019Connell or Martin Johnson. And Clive Woodward has said \u201cit\u2019s not a case of if but when\u201d Itoje will captain England. On the other side of the balance, Itoje has his dad on his back, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s important not to feel too special about everything that is going on. If I don\u2019t do it I have my dad on the phone and I don\u2019t really want that happening,\u201d Itoje says. \u201cI know I\u2019m nowhere near where I think I can be so I\u2019ll keep pushing forward.\u201d It will help that the competition for those two starting spots at lock is so fierce. On Saturday night, Jones said that he thought Itoje and his second-row partner George Kruis \u201ccould be locking our scrum for a long time to come\u201d. Kruis has also been outstanding in this Six Nations. But then as recently as last autumn Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes looked to have divvied up the two starting spots between them. Launchbury is only 24, and was, rightly, ranked high among the contenders for the captaincy before Jones gave it to Dylan Hartley. Add in Dave Attwood as well. As Itoje said: \u201cIn England we have a plethora of second-rows.\u201d That strength in depth will certainly help keep Itoje honest as he presses inexorably ahead in his career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
