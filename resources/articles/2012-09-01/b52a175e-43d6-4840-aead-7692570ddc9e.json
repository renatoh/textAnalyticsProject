Lilyhammer (BBC4) first then, and here's Steven Van Zandt as an east-coast American mobster \u2013 as he should be, as he was in The Sopranos of course. So far, so not so strange. Van Zandt's character, Frank \"The Fixer\" Tagliano, has a small disagreement with the new boss. There's a shooting in a bar, Frank The Fixer's dog Lily \u2013 a little white fluffy thing, possibly a West Highland white terrier \u2013 gets tragically whacked. Frank's not happy, he testifies against the new boss, takes witness protection, gets a new identity, and a new life, in Lillehammer, Norway. Why Lillehammer? Because Frank thought it looked nice when he saw it on the Winter Olympics (I'm going to Lake Placid if I ever have to disappear). He even named his (now sadly deceased) dog after it. That's where the discrepancy in the spellings comes from. So there you have it, a New York gangster in embarrassing Scandi jumpers and moonboots, that's what Lilyhammer \u2013 a Norwegian-American collaboration \u2013 is all about. You can take the man out of the mob, but you can't ... etc. Frank hasn't left everything behind, soon he's up to his old tricks \u2013 dodgy deals, blackmail, extortion, violence, all carried out with a certain Italian-New Yorker charm of course. It won't be long before the whole town's going around saying glem det (that's Norwegian for fuhgeddaboudit, I'm actually quite good at Norwegian). And surely there will be a moose's head turning up in someone's bed. You'd have to saw the horns off first, though. Or use Mrs Moose's head. See, here is a severed animal's head, already. A sheep's in fact, and actually it's just fallen out of the shopping bag of Frank's new neighbour (they have sheep's head for tea over there). She \u2013 the neighbour not the sheep \u2013 happens to be the chief of police. Awkward. Another sheep gets whacked, this time by a wolf. So Frank whacks the wolf back (well, it's about honour really isn't it, and pride). And suddenly what was a charming sleepy winter wonderland is a hotbed of organised crime and whackage. The change coincides with Frank's arrival. His neighbour \u2013 chief of police, and chief sheep's-head-eater remember \u2013 begins to get suspicious ... You might expect (unfairly perhaps and based only on who's in it and where it's set) that Lilyhammer would be The-Sopranos-meets-The-Killing, a rich blend of grand American masterpiece and Nordic noir. It's not. It's more like fish-out-of-water fare. You know, a little bit Crocodile Dundee in New York, a little bit Local Hero, a little bit any number of BBC3 reality shows that send badly behaved British brats to the third world in order to buck up their ideas. Certainly a little bit odd (Sillyhammer?). But it has a certain charm to it, and Van Zandt is very watchable. I quite like it. One thing. After the tragic events of last summer, this slightly stereotypical portrayal of the country as an innocent place populated by charming naive sing-song people in bad knitwear looks if not wrong, then perhaps rose-tinted. Norway can be just as bad ass (in a bad way) as New York can. Always has been, in fact, as Neil Oliver explains, with relish, in Vikings (BBC2). \"It wasn't just what they did that made them dangerous, it was what they thought and what they believed.\" Now Neil's trying to get inside their heads, to think like the Vikings did (actually this first one is mainly about pre-proper Vikings, but he wants to understand what they came out of). That means taking a lot of trains around Scandinavia, looking out the window, thinking like a Viking. He meets experts, drinks coffee (so much coffee), studies rock carvings and burial mounds, eats some proto-Viking marinated pork (looks better than the sheep's head). And he sleeps in a bronze-age house. To be honest I got a little impatient for the main event, for the great voyages and invasions. Enough of these village people, bring on the pillage people. Love the Oseberg ship in Oslo though, which, says Neil, wasn't only used to ferry the living, but also the dead. People of course \u2013 Eric (or Erica, ladies got proper Viking burials too), or whichever bigshot it was. But they would also be sent off with everything they needed for whatever came next. Like animals. Horses were slaughtered, and dogs \u2013 hunting ones, pets, possibly West Highland white terriers \u2013 and thrown in. Imagine it, a ship piled high with corpses. And imagine the smell when they set fire to it all. Mmmmm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
