Two days later, at 5am, I found myself locked out of my cousin's house and sleeping in the outside toilet. As my hangover was being replaced by frostbite, I tried to reason that this was no less an adventure than negotiating a Peruvian night bus, but somehow it didn't work. Adversity abroad is an adventure, at home it's just a pain in the arse. My four months as a Netjetter have been even better than I expected. I set myself a challenging (or was that stupid) route through East Africa, South America and the Caribbean. The pressure of having something interesting to write about each week forced me out of my comfort zone and into paragliders, white water rafts, up mountains and into conversations which I may otherwise have passed by. It's a near impossible task to shortlist the highlights. There was something incredible almost every day, but for the five magic moments, places or events that will remain in my addled brain long after my backpack is collecting dust, I would choose these: safari in Tanzania - the fear of watching a lion stroll casually past your tent, puts mundane moans into perspective; tasting life and beer in Kampala - the place that really got under my skin, getting a feel for how Kampalan's lived their lives was better than any \"paid for\" sightseeing trip; tango in Buenos Aires - I defy anyone to find a sexier dance in a sexier city than this; the Salaar de Uyuni in Bolivia - standing on the salt flats staring at the miles of mirrored clouds is the finest non-narcotic route to discovering that it truly is a magical world we live in and finally the Orinoco delta - while we worry about labels, bank balances and house prices, the Warao people of Venezuela let their children run around naked as they catch fish to cook on a wood stove in their stilt houses. None of these places were on my original list of things to see before I die, proving that if you keep your eyes peeled en route, the best may be the side dish rather than the main course. Coming back home is a sweet and sour experience, lovely though it is to see my friends and family, the ordinary sneaks back up on you quicker than the flip-flop marks take to fade. Every time grey skies threaten rain, I find myself thinking about an escape flight back to Buenos Aires. Nights out with my friends and familiar banter with the family, helps to ease myself back into normal life. Just when I was trying to extend the jetlagged holiday hangover, I've somehow managed to find myself a place to rent and a job with my former employers. In exactly six days I will be sitting at my old desk, living 300m from my old flat and the Ugandan mountain gorillas will seem like a million-year-old memory. My nearest and dearest all have bets on when I'll next be off with no regard for job and life security. As I assure them that from now on, it's just some nice holidays for me, my alter ego is already looking for the mosquito net and packing the guidebook. There were some scary times when I wondered why the hell I didn't choose to go Switzerland instead, but having avoided the gunfire, muggings and sickness, I'm glad that I chose the countries that I did. If I had a pound for all the people I met who said, \"aren't you worried about travelling on your own around here,\" I would be rich enough to do it all again and I would. Travelling as a single woman in your 30s certainly has its advantages: you're old enough to appreciate the culture and scenery but young enough to dance until 6am (just), you're young enough to charm a bus driver into dropping you off-route but too old for the young boys to hassle, you're young enough to cope with smelly hiking boots in cramped dormitories but old enough to appreciate dinner in a beautiful restaurant washed down with a fine wine and finally, you're young enough to have a fling with a handsome traveller or local and although you're old enough to know better, you do it anyway. It won't be long before memories of this trip become daydream fodder. Although tied to my desk back in dotcom hell, in my absent-mind I will be doing any one of the following: watching the dhows at sunset in Zanzibar; tasting banana beer; talking to pygmy tribes-people in Uganda; slicing through a perfect steak in Buenos Aires; laughing at penguins in Patagonia; sailing through sky blue lakes in Bariloche; walking in the heat of the Atacama desert; swimming in hot springs; marvelling at pink lakes, ogling salt flats; cringing at bad toilets; dancing at carnivals; walking through jungles, waterfalls and narrow city streets; snorkelling in warm clear seas and always wondering what the next day will bring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
