Bernie Sanders offered his definition of democratic socialism. Hillary Clinton supports implementing a no-fly zone over Syria. The House of Representatives passed a bill to add an extra layer of scrutiny to refugees from Syria and Iraq seeking asylum in the United States. Donald Trump thinks childcare is easy to provide. Trump makes clear \u201c I know Muslim people, they are phenomenal people, they are a really great people but they get tarnished by the acts of others\u201d and goes on to warn about radical Islam. He also says of refugees, \u201cthese folks aren\u2019t coming from Sweden.\u201d Trump says \u201cI don\u2019t think the caucuses are antiquated.\u201d He pledges \u201cif I win, the caucuses aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Trump now weighs in refugees. \u201cI feel totally bad for them but at the same time we don\u2019t know who they are and we don\u2019t know here they come from. But at the same time I also feel bad for people in this country, you\u2019ll have hundreds of thousands people coming in.\u201d He thinks Syria will eventually be wonderful but, in the meantime, letting in refugees will be a \u201ctrojan horse.\u201d Trump on unions, \u201cI\u2019ve done it both ways.\u201d He notes that you need to work with unions in New York City but that he doesn\u2019t do so in Florida which has a weak organized labor movement. Trump says \u201cI\u2019ve been able to live with unions but if I had my choice, I\u2019d take it without [unions].\u201d Trump says \u201cI\u2019m ok\u201d with subsidies for wind energy. He adds \u201cwind is very tough\u201d to laughter. Trump notes that with oil prices falling, wind energy has become less competitive. He noted the wind energy needs subsidies which he\u2019s ok with but expresses concern about it. Trump also expresses some wonder about the process of generating wind power. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think out of the wind, you make energy.\u201d On the subject of equal pay for women, Trump praises his daughter Ivanka who he says is cutting a television ad for him in Georgia. Trump says \u201cif you say everyone gets equal pay, you\u2019re getting away from the American Dream, you\u2019re getting away from capitalism.\u201d Instead, he says \u201cpeople have to go out there and fight for themselves.\u201d Trump is now praising the middle class and bemoaning those who he thinks got victimized the most in the economic downturn, those who saved. In Trump\u2019s view, those who saved now get almost no interest from the banks and those who spent freely made deals with the banks. However, he pledges under his tax plan, \u201ceveryone will get a big, fat, beautiful deduction.\u201d Trump gets a question about childcare and says \u201cit\u2019s not something you hear as much about.\u201d The questioner says she doesn\u2019t have kids and Trump jokes \u201cnow I feel better when I don\u2019t give her much of an answer.\u201d He talks about the childcare available at his businesses where the kids are called \u201cTrumpeteers.\u201d Trump adds childcare isn\u2019t very expensive for businesses to provide \u201call you need is one or two people, some blocks and a swing.\u201d Meanwhile, in Alabama: Ben Carson enters the arena from the tunnel normally used by athletic teams, waving to an enthusiastic crowd of about 3,000. It\u2019s a good crowd for 4:20 pm local time on a Thursday in Mobile. The crowd, though, is notably homogeneous; Mobile\u2019s population is half black, but the audience is almost entirely white. Carson knows his audience. He opened with a story about prayer. \u201cI told God: \u2018If you\u2019ll open the doors, I\u2019ll walk through them.\u2019\u201d Then he reminisced about how as a child he loved stories of missionary doctors, \u201cthe most noble people on the earth,\u201d traveling the globe to bring \u201cphysical and spiritual healing.\u201d The last big candidate to pass through Mobile was Donald Trump, whose bombastic style riled his audience. Carson\u2019s tone \u2013 and his crowd \u2013 are characteristically mellow. His biggest round of applause came on a note of indirect criticism about Obama. He listed a series of objectives an enemy of America might have, and finished with, \u201cAny resemblance to what\u2019s actually going on today is purely coincidental.\u201d Overall, Carson is serving red meat in a red state. On the matter of government assistance, Carson said, people have misread the preamble to the constitution. \u201cIt says, \u2018promote the general welfare.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t mean to put everybody on welfare.\u201d Big applause. In closing, Carson cited Thomas Jefferson, saying that the founding father predicted America\u2019s government would \u201cexpand and infiltrate, invade our lives and begin to dominate us.\u201d But, he said, \u201cJust before it was too late, the people would realize what was going on and they would rise up. I say this is that moment.\u201d Loud whoops from the crowd, as Carson exited the stage. Trump is now touting his tax plan as the cure to economic woes of struggling factory towns like Newton. The plan which involves major tax cuts across the board is available here. Trump says \u201cwe are going to have to start a program\u201d to help students with loans. He says the \u201cone government program that the United States makes money off is student loans and that\u2019s one that they shouldn\u2019t make money off of.\u201d Trump continues to talk about helping people refinance student loans but without getting into specifics. Not everyone is getting to enjoy Trump\u2019s town hall in Newton today. Buzzfeed\u2019s Evan McMorris-Santoro reports that he has been barred from the event on Twitter. McMorris-Santoro is not the first reporter to fall on Trump\u2019s blacklist. After an editorial from the Des Moines Register that the real estate mogul objected to, his campaign has refused to credential any reporter from that outlet. Trump has been rising in the polls in recent days and he points to the terrorist attacks in Paris last Friday as one reason. \u201cNow since Paris, people are really starting to like my hard line immigration,\u201d he says. In discussing Oreo cookies, Trump says \u201cI could stand to lose some weight.\u201d Trump gets big applause from the room when he says \u201cwe\u2019re going to build the wall.\u201d He adds \u201cwalls work.\u201d When he\u2019s asked about Newton\u2019s economic issues, Trump says \u201cI know something about this town because I saw 60 Minutes four or five years ago.\u201d Trump\u2019s first question is about how he can emphasize with those struggling to pay the rent and feed their families. He starts off by mentioning the financial downturn in the 1990s, when his real estate empire experienced serious losses. Trump then segues into the passage in his stump speech where he argues the unemployment rate is far higher than the government claims. And only a few minutes late, Trump arrives on stage in Iowa to a crowd of about 300 attendees who will question him about job creation and the economy. Donald Trump is running late to his forum in Iowa and moderator Dave Price tells attendees \u201cif you see a blur on Interstate 80 that is the Trump motorcade on its way.\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s business manager Armstrong Williams has served as an all purpose fixer, strategist and spokesman for the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s presidential campaign. Williams frequently appears on television as surrogate for Carson and is one of the candidate\u2019s closest friends However, now Carson is separating himself from Williams. He told reporters Thursday \u201c[Williams] has nothing to do with the campaign. Nothing. Armstrong can comment on his own behalf. He does not speak for the campaign at all. He does not speak for me. He speaks for himself.\u201d This comes after Williams contradicted himself in an interview with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann of Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. There, he provided varying explanations as to Carson\u2019s relations with a foreign policy advisor who said the candidate doesn\u2019t know very much about the Middle East. Williams also admitted Carson is on \u201ca learning curve\u201d on foreign policy. My colleague and Guardian US southern correspondent Matthew Teague reports from on the trail with Carson in Alabama: With 10 minutes before Ben Carson is set to speak at the University of South Alabama\u2019s Mitchell Center, about 2,500 people have arrived and are taking their seats. There\u2019s room for 3,500, but more people are winding their way through security checks. Uptempo jazz is playing over the arena\u2019s public address system. Carson staffers are passing out signs that read \u2018Heal\u2019 and \u2018Inspire\u2019. For the first time in eight years, a presidential candidate will receive Federal Election Commission (FEC) matching funds. The FEC announced this afternoon that Maryland Democrat Martin O\u2019Malley had been declared eligible for matching funds. He is the first candidate since John Edwards in 2007 to do so. While the use of federal matching funds had long been common in presidential campaigns, their rejection by Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary quickly made them obsolete. Federal matching funds means that for every dollar that a presidential candidate raises in a contribution of under $250, they get an additional dollar from the federal government. However, they have to abide by strict limits for what they can spend both nationally and in individual states. O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign has long been on shaky financial ground and while the federal matching funds will make it more likely that his campaign will stay solvent through the Iowa Caucuses, it is an even bigger impediment to his already slim chances of actually winning the nomination. Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t just in the news today for her foreign policy speech. The Washington Post put together a comprehensive look at the Clinton donor network over the past 40 years, from Bill Clinton\u2019s first run for Congress in 1974 until the present. The article takes a look at the $3 billion that the Clintons have raised both for the Clinton Foundation and for their political campaigns and who they have raised that sum from. On Capitol Hill today, the House of Representatives approved legislation to add another layer of scrutiny for the process of admitting refugees from Syria and Iraq by a veto-proof margin. As I reported earlier: With almost unanimous support from Republicans and 47 Democrats voting in favor, the House approved by 289 votes to 137 the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, which would require the secretary of homeland security, the FBI director and the director of national intelligence to each certify that a refugee was not a threat to national security before they were admitted to the United States. This certification would come on top of the pre-existing extensive screening process for refugees seeking admittance to the United States, which currently takes over 18 months. The bill will not be taken by the Senate until December, after the Thanksgiving recess. It is likely to face a Democratic filibuster there and even if it somehow passes, the White House has already pledged to veto it. In about an hour Donald Trump will be holding a forum on job creation in the central Iowa town of Newton. Newton received international attention during the 2008 Iowa caucuses as its biggest employer Maytag had recently shut its factory there. At one point, it had employed over 4,000 people in a town of roughly 15,000. Since then, a Nascar track has opened there and several manufacturers associated with the wind energy industry have set up shop in the town. Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t the only presidential candidate talking about foreign policy today. In an op-ed in Politico, Florida Senator Marco Rubio wrote about his support for an international coalition to combat ISIS and to impose a no fly zone in Syria. We will only be able to protect our people at home if we defeat ISIL abroad. I would build a multinational coalition of countries willing to send troops into Iraq and Syria to aid local forces on the ground. When I am president, I will tell my commanders that the mission is the total destruction of ISIL and will send them the forces necessary to succeed. Cutting off oxygen to ISIL also requires defeating Assad in Syria. I would declare no-fly zones to ground Assad\u2019s air force and coalition-controlled \u201csafe zones\u201d in the country to stop his military. These safe zones would stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters. I would oppose Russia and Iran in their fight to prolong Assad\u2019s brutal regime. After an hourlong address on both socialism and foreign policy and about 20 minutes worth of questions from students, the Vermont senator has left Georgetown University. The speech began with a reference to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s Second Inaugural, ended with the statement \u201cISIS must be destroyed\u201d and, in between, compared the 1973 overthrow of the Allende government in Chile with the Iraq War. In short, it was a campaign speech that only Bernie Sanders could give. The Vermont senator says his campaign \u201cis not just about electing Bernie Sanders for President. It\u2019s about much more than that. Sanders now talking about compromise. \u201cWhen you are in Congress, you compromise everyday.\u201d He cites bipartisan work with Republicans like John McCain. However, he insists his platform is not \u201cradical\u201d and that he is not coming before the American people \u201cas this radical, wild-eyed socialist.\u201d Sanders say now talking about the links between global warming and terrorism, saying that extreme weather will lead \u201cto massive displacement of people\u201d as they are forced to migrate because of lack of land and water. He adds \u201cit is not debatable. Climate change is a major major inducement to international conflict and terrorism.\u201d An indirect shot at Donald Trump comes as Sanders says he is \u201cunhappy to hear about people who are talking about closing mosques.\u201d Trump said he would be open to the concept in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Sanders reiterates that \u201cit would be a terrible mistake for many many reasons for the United States to get involved unilaterally in the war in Syria or reinvolved in Iraq.\u201d The Vermont senator is now discussing his proposed legislation on college affordability. It would make all public colleges free and lower interest rates on student loans for those attending private colleges. He admits that it is \u201ca expensive proposition\u201d and would cost $70 billion a year. Sanders says it would be paid for with a tax on \u201cWall Street speculation.\u201d Sanders\u2019 first question is about why he identifies as a socialist. He answers by saying: \u201cI think the reason I have always, throughout my political career, defined myself as a democratic socialist is because that in fact is my vision.\u201d He goes on to define socialism as the belief that \u201creal change does not take place unless we have the courage to take on the very powerful special interests that control their country.\u201d With a rousing call for young people to engage in the political process, Bernie Sanders\u2019s speech has ended and so has Alan Yuhas\u2019s stewardship of this liveblog. This is Ben Jacobs taking over as Sanders starts a question and answer session with questions submitted by students attending the speech. \u201cThe bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed, but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone,\u201d he says. While individual nations indeed have historic disputes \u2013 the U.S. and Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia \u2013 the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying ISIS. Sadly as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized. Thus, we must work with our partners in Europe, the Gulf states, Africa and south-east Asia \u2013 all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose. \u2026 A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground, while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need. He concludes: \u201call across this country there is a significant alienation about the political process. People look to Washington and they throw their hands up and they say \u2018what in god\u2019s name is going on there \u2026 why aren\u2019t we developing a rational foreign policy rather than getting involved in a quagmire in the Middle East, which could lead to perpetual war?\u2019 \u2026 The problems that we face are very, very serious \u2026 but by and large, all of these problems were caused by bad human decisions. And if we come together, if we stand together, if we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by race, by weather we\u2019re gay whether we\u2019re straight whether we\u2019re born in America \u2026 if we stand together \u2026 if we are prepared to engage in the political process, I am confident there is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish. Sanders says a political solution must be found to transition Bashar al-Assad out of Syria: \u201cThe diplomatic plan for Assad\u2019s transition from power is a good step in a united front.\u201d But our priority must be to defeat ISIS. Nations all over the world, who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist, must make the destruction of Isis the highest priority. Nations in the region must commit \u2013 that instead of turning a blind eye \u2013 they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq. We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism \u2013 rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders. This is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face Sanders says he wants an agreement from the Gulf states that they will put aside their ideological and power disputes to focus on Isis. All of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them. They have got to come up to the plate. As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against Isis takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need. Sanders is now criticizing the Gulf states in earnest, denigrating Saudi Arabia for its fixation on Yemen and Qatar for its reported $200bn budget for the 2022 World Cup. Saudi Arabia has the third largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting Isis they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by US troops after the first Gulf War, has been a well-known source of financing for Isis and other violent extremists. It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 bn on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event \u2013 $200bn on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against Isis. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups in the region. He outlines his ideas for a new alliance of nations, western and from the Middle East, and calls out the Gulf states for doing \u201cfar too little\u201d despite their \u201cenormous wealth and resources\u201d. A new and strong coalition of Western powers, Muslim nations, and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counter-terrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing, and to end support for exporting radical ideologies. What does all of this mean? Well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little. Equally important, and this is a point that must be made \u2013 countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE \u2013 countries of enormous wealth and resources \u2013 have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little. \u201cBut let us be very clear,\u201d he says \u2013 neither the US nor the west alone should take destroying Isis as their sole responsibility. While the US and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam. And countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations, with the strong support of their global partners. Sanders says he\u2019s been heartened by hearing from Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II that Muslims must lead the fight. Like Hillary Clinton, he makes a special point to thank Abdullah and the Jordanians. Sanders says his foreign policy would be inspired by the same spirit that created Nato, and that he wants to create a 21st century version of the organization. It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror. We must create an organization like nato to confront the security threats of the 21st century \u2013 an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts. We must work with our NATO partners, and expand our coalition to include Russia and members of the Arab League. \u201cI\u2019m not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad,\u201d he says, segueing into foreign policy. I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight. He takes a somber moment to say that he joins the mourning for the victims of Paris, the Russian jet downed in Egypt, and a terrorist attack in Lebanon. To my mind, it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy [Isis], and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing. But we cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 do it alone. He says that his foreign policy would be based on learning from the mistakes of the past: \u201cIt begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort, and that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades.\u201d It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past \u2013 rushing to war, regime change in Iraq, or toppling Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran in 1953. Mossadegh was the president, CIA, MI6 got rid of him to protect [interests], the shah got rid of him \u2026 and that is where we are in Iran today. Decisions are consequences, often unintended consequences. So whether it was Saddam, or Mossadegh, or Guatemalan President \u00c1rbenz in 1954, Brazilian President Goulart in 1964, Chilean President Allende in 1973. This type of regime change, this type of overthrowing governments we may not like, often does not work, often makes a bad or difficult decision even worse. These are lessons we must learn. Sanders says he\u2019s been awed by the enthusiasm and idealism of young people, and that he hopes they can resist cynicism while accepting realism and continue to participate in politics. \u201cI\u2019m not running for president because it\u2019s my turn, not quite I was born in a three and a half room apartment in working class Brooklyn, New York\u201d I am running for president in order for all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, not for the few, but for my seven grandchildren and for all of you. Nobody understood better than Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the connection between American strength at home and our ability to defend America at home and across the world. That is why he proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944, and he said in that very same State of the Union, and I quote again: \u201cAmerica\u2019s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.\u201d Sanders says he despises \u201cappeals to nativism and prejudice, and I do believe in immigration reform that gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life.\u201d And while I\u2019m on that subject, let me just say a real word of concern from what I\u2019m hearing on that subject from some of the Republican candidates \u2026 People can have real disagreements \u2026 that\u2019s part of the political process, but people should not be using that process to inject racism into the debate. \u201cIf Donald Trump and others want to open that door,\u201d he says, \u201cour job is to shut it, and to shut it tight!\u201d \u201cOur country has come too far and too many people have died for us to continue hearing racist words from our political leaders.\u201d \u201cSo the next time someone accuses me of being a socialist \u2013 tomorrow,\u201d Sanders quips, before making a crescendo of statements about what he does and does not believe. I don\u2019t believe the government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of prodcution, but I do believe that the middle class families who produce the goods of this country deserve a fair standard of living and that their incomes should go up, and not down. I believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes \u2013 if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should. I believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas. I don\u2019t believe in special treatment for the top 1%, but I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that Black Lives Matter. He gets a huge ovation for the last line. \u201cIt is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits,\u201d Sanders says, or that billionaires and speculators are able to \u201cable to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on that speculation.\u201d Democratic socialism, to me, does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice and environmental sanity. Of course it does mean that. Bt it also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote. \u2026 It is extremely sad that the United States, one of the oldest democracies on earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country, and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely. He argues to automatically register Americans to vote once they turn 18. Clearly, despite the efforts of many Republican governors to suppress the vote, but our job together is to make it easier for people to vote, not harder to vote. It is not a radical idea, and I fight for this as president of this country, to say that everyone in this country who is 18 years of age or older is registered to vote \u2013 end of discussion. \u201cGreed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support,\u201d he says, even if innovation and entrepreneurship deserve rewards. Democratic socialism means, that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. He says that the wealthiest 15 Americans saw their wealth increase by $170bn over the last two years \u2013 \u201cit is not acceptable\u201d. He then again quotes Pope Francis: \u201cThe worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.\u201d \u201cIn other words, we\u2019ve got to do better than that \u2026 We\u2019ve got to stop worshipping people who make billions and billions and billions of dollars while we have the highest rate of child poverty of any [industrialized] country.\u201d Sanders says democratic socialism means a $15 minimum wage, and a new conception of wages s living wages. It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong Paid Family and Medical Leave legislation now in Congress. He says he will help end \u201cthe absurdity\u201d of the United States\u2019 medical leave laws, saying he would make sure Americans get at least three months. \u201cDemocratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment,\u201d he says, to a big cheer. And it means to me that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren. Democratic socialism means \u201cthe right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free,\u201d he says. Is this a radical, socialistic idea? I don\u2019t think so. It exists today in many countries around the world. And you know what? it used to exist in the United States. Democratic socialism means investing in infrastructure, small businesses and jobs, he says. \u201cIt is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for young people who are unemployed than to lock them up and invest in jails and incarceration.\u201d \u201cThink about it,\u201d he says repeatedly, getting into the details of the pitch. People who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment. They could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees. Think about it, and we don\u2019t talk about this very much, we\u2019ve got millions of workers who are staying in jobs that they do not want to stay in but they\u2019re there because they want a decent healthcare system for them and their families. He then suggests an alternative: \u201cWe\u2019ve got millions of young people saying this is the job I love \u2026 and I don\u2019t have to worry about healthcare because all of us in America have healthcare. \u2026 . And by the way, moving to a Medicare for all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\u201d Sanders now makes his pitch for what democratic socialism would do for middle class Americans \u2013 his stump speech rally against \u201cwelfare for corporations\u201d and healthcare for all. In my view, it\u2019s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers losing their jobs. It means that we create a government that works for works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for. It means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. Now I know that there are some people out there who think this is just a completely radical idea, imagine, all of us having healthcare as a right. But I hope all of you know this is not a radical idea, it is a conservative idea. It is an idea exists in every other major country on earth. Not just Denmark, Sweden or Scandanavia or Noraway. It exists in Canada, I live 50 miles away from Canada. It exists in France, Germany and Taiwan \u2026 I believe it is time for the United States to join the rest of the world. Medicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, \u2026 [but it would] would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy. He now flips the language of socialism and capitalism on its head, accusing Wall Street of rigging the system to redistribute power in its favor and secure its longevity. It is a system, for example, which during the 1990s allowed Wall Street to spend $5bn in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated. They wanted the government off of their backs, they wanted to do whatever they wanted to do. \u2026 Then, 10 years later, after the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of Wall Street led to their collapse, it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out. Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out. Quite a system! And, then, to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, the bankers were too big to jail. Young people who get caught possessing marijuana, they get police records. \u2026 On the other hand Wall Street CEOs who help destroy the economy, they don\u2019t get police records, they get raises in their salaries. This is what Martin Luther King Jr meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else. \u201cSo let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me,\u201d Sanders says. It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King Jr said in 1968 when he stated that; \u201cThis country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, their elderly citizens, their children, the sick and the poor. Democratic socialism means that we must reform a [political system] that is corrupt, it means we create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy. Sanders nears the heart of what he thinks of as democratic socialism, which is belief in the right to economic security. In that speech, Roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every American was entitled to: The right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing, and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. The right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care. What Roosevelt was stating in 1944, what Martin Luther King Jr stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today, is that true freedom does not occur without economic security. People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours. People are not truly free when they don\u2019t know how they\u2019re goign to get help when they or a family member are sick. \u201cThe bottom line is that today in America we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality,\u201d Sanders continues. A handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress. He jumps back to FDR and a state of the union address in which he \u201coutlined what he called a second Bill of Rights.\u201d This is in my view one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but, unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves. In that remarkable speech this is what Roosevelt stated, and I quote: \u201cWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\u201d End of quote. In other words, real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt\u2019s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved. And it is time that we did. He now points out that healthcare and retirement systems are in shambles: \u201cmillions of seniors and people with disabilities trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year from soial security. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death. \u201cHow will I retire with dignity?\u201d He tells students to get out their calculators later and try to do the math for surviving on these numbers. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d Today in America, nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20% of our children, including 36% of African American children, are living in poverty \u2014 the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. \u2026 How, \u201cwith the proliferation of billionaires\u201d, is this possible, he asks. Today in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. Further, with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions \u2026 what insanity is that? Today in America, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35%. For African American kids it is over 50%. Meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country. China, communist authoritarian country four times our size, we have more people in jail than China. And countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80bn a year locking up our fellow Americans. Sanders hits the first real crescendo of his speech, railing against the \u201cgrotesque\u201d inequality of life in the United States. Today in America, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top. In fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. Porblem is it has gone in the wrong direction. And the last 30 years we have seen trillions of wealth flow from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1% \u2013 a handful of people \u2013 top one-tenth of 1% \u2013 who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own during that period. Doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own. Unbelievably, and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of 1% today owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90%. \u2026 That is not the kind of America that we should accept. I can tell you that in my state of Vermont and all over the country, it is absolutely not uncommon to see people are working two or three jobs to cobble together the healthcare they and their families need. In fact, Americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country. But despite the incredibly hard work \u2026 husbands hardly see wives, people don\u2019t have the quality time for the kids, because they\u2019re working so hard, and despite all of that \u2026 58% of all new income generated today is going to the top 1%. Today in America, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income, is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago, [adjusting for inflation] People are so angry because they\u2019re working so hard and all the income goes to the wealthy, he says. If Americans \u201care serious about transforming our country\u201d and rebuilding the middle class and \u201creinvigorating our democracy,\u201d Sanders says, the US needs a new movement. We need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. Now I know things like \u2018rling class\u2019 are not too often talked about at Georgetown, not too often talked about on CBS or NBC, but that is a simple fact. In my view, the billionaire class must be told clearly and simply that they cannot have it all. That our government belongs to all of us, and not just a handful of billionaires. In what would be a surprise for any other \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d Sanders invokes the pop, to denounce \u201cthe worship of money\u201d. We need to create a culture which, as Pope Francis has reminded us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in America go hungry and veterans, men and women who have put their lives on the lines to defend us, sleep out on the streets. But Americans have to face \u201ca very hard truth\u201d, he says, \u201cthe rich get much richer, almost everyone else gets poorer.\u201d He jumps back to an anecdote of getting computers in city hall as mayor of Burlington, Vermont in the 1980s \u2026 Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, despite major growth in the US and global economy, tens of millions of American families continue to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families. And I hope that none of you will turn your back on that reality. And the truth is\u2026 is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low. \u2026 The very rich get much richer, almost everyone else gets poorer. Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections. Koch brothers alone and a few of their friends will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. Ordinary people, working people, young people don\u2019t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it. Sanders jumps to the 1960s, and invokes Lyndon Johnson\u2019s healthcare reforms: Medicare and Medicaid for senior citizens, people with disabilities, families with children. Once again these vitally important programs were derided by right wing forces as socialist programs that were a threat to our American way of life. That was then, now is now. Today, in 2015, despite the Wall Street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Depression, the American people are clearly better off economically than they were in 1937. And by the way, almost everything FDR proposed was called \u201csocialist,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cI thought I would mention that just in passing.\u201d Social Security, which transformed life for the elderly in this country was defined by his opponents as \u2018socialist.\u2019 The concept of the \u2018minimum wage\u2019 was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as \u2018socialist.\u2019 Unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, when children were working in factories or working in the fields, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining \u2026 strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as \u2018socialist.\u2019 Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and in fact the foundation of the middle class. He does air quotes with his fingers when saying \u201csocialist\u201d. Roosevelt acted, Sanders goes on, \u201cagainst the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists.\u201d Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of Americans back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government. He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country. He combatted cynicism, fear and despair. He reinvigorated democracy. He transformed the country. And that is exactly what we have to do today. Sanders takes the stage to absolutely raucous applause. \u201cOur country faces some enormous problems,\u201d he says, saying that these problems won\u2019t be solved if people succumb to apathy. He begins his remarks to the Georgetown students by the spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \u2013 and his remarks in the depths of the Great Depression. He saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life. He saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them every single day. He saw millions of his fellow Americans denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children. He saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty, by their lack of disposable income denying employment \u2026 He saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished. Dan Roberts, the Guardian\u2019s DC bureau chief, is at Georgetown University for senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 long awaited speech on democratic socialism, his avowed system of belief. As in New York, where \u201chipsters \u2018heart\u2019 Bernie\u201d, in the words of my colleague Adam Gabbatt, young people have embraced Sanders\u2019 message in Washington. His speech is scheduled for 2pm ET. Elsewhere in the Republican primary, the candidates have all filed paperwork for the New Hampshire primary. Typically, Trump put himself (or at least his slogan) center stage. Bush on the other hand went to Dunkin Donuts. And senator Rand Paul made a curious plea from George Washington University. Paul is speaking at the school about surveillance and privacy, issues where he diverges from most of his competitors. He told the audience that more surveillance does not mean greater security, as spy chief so often insist. The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel is listening in, tweeting that Paul uses French surveillance as an example. French programs are \u201c1,000 times more invasive than ours and it didn\u2019t predict the attack\u201d in Paris, Paul says. Congressional Republicans are expected to vote on Thursday to suspend the program bringing Syrian refugees to the US, and several governors have said they would reject all refugees \u2013 orphaned toddlers included \u2013 for fear of a terror attack. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the bill and condemned rhetoric as \u201cun-American\u201d, but experts worry about backlash \u2013 my colleagues Lauren Gambino, Patrick Kingsley and Alberto Nardelli try to parse the fact, fears and fiction. Could dangerous refugees come to the US? Such a fear is misguided because the process of relocating refugees to America is very different from the way that refugees currently arrive in Europe. Syrians flown to the US will be the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the US,according to the State Department. Each candidate is vetted first by the UN\u2019s refugee agency, and then separately by officials from the State Department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department. The process takes between 18 months and two years. By contrast, a refugee hoping to reach Europe can pay a smuggler approximately $1,000 (\u00a3660) to take them in a dinghy across the six-mile-wide strait between Turkey and the Greek islands. Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers? Syrian refugees are generally afraid of exactly the same thing that Americans are: Islamist terrorism. Many are fleeing areas held by the Islamic State, and they are doing so in contravention of Isis edicts. On a dozen occasions, Isis has condemned refugees for fleeing Isis areas. \u201cFor those who want to blame the attacks on Paris on refugees, you might want to get your facts straight,\u201d wrote Aaron Zelin, an analyst of jihadis, in a blogpost. \u201cThe reality is, [Isis] loathes that individuals are fleeing Syria for Europe. It undermines [Isis\u2019s] message that its self-styled Caliphate is a refuge.\u201d \u201cSyrian and Iraqi refugees are the victims of terrorism, fleeing the same type of atrocities that we\u2019ve recently witnessed,\u201d said Shelly Pitterman, of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve rejected the ideology of extremism and share the values of freedom and tolerance.\u201d You can read more about how many refugees each country has accepted and plans to accept, and whether governors even can block refugees, through the link below. Republican candidate Ben Carson is in Mobile, Alabama, responding to questions about his foreign policy expertise or lack thereof. In the last few days two of his advisers have said he struggles with the people and places of the world. Carson responds now by saying that those men aren\u2019t really advisers after all. One, former CIA operative Duane Clarridge, told the New York Times that Carson cannot manage \u201cone iota of intelligent information about the Middle East\u201d. Carson now says Clarridge is not an adviser but a \u201cconsultant\u201d, CNN\u2019s Athena Jones tweets. Armstrong Williams \u2013 described variously as a top adviser, friend and business manager to Carson \u2013 was also involved in the story, and frequently appears on television to boost the retired doctor. Carson has just disavowed Williams too, telling reporters he is \u201che has nothing to do with the campaign.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker observes something amiss. Carson then said that he takes foreign policy advice from retired army officer Robert Dees, Nixon secretary of state Henry Kissinger and Reagan adviser Bud McFarlane. The retired neurosurgeon did answer some questions about policy, saying Isis is more of a threat to the US than al-Qaida was in 2001. He said that although he agrees \u201cIslam itself is not necessarily [the] adversary\u201d in the fight against terrorism, he wants stricter screening measures for Syrian refugees. He then used a rabid dog metaphor for illustration. Carson\u2019s campaign also ran into criticism this week for publishing a graphic of the country with New England distended well beyond the actual boundaries of the United States. You can read more about Carson\u2019s foreign policy ideas and his squad of eccentric helpers, including \u201can ambassador for the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d, in reporting by my colleague Tom McCarthy. A check-in with the University of Florida\u2019 election analyst Michael McDonald on that other primary race and its multiform competitors. Hillary Clinton outlined a sweeping strategy for the US in the Middle East and combating extremism around the world at the Council of Foreign Relations, its key points bulleted below. Clinton said she would intensify the air and ground campaign against Islamic State extremists (Isis) in Iraq and Syria, but ruled out ground troops beyond special forces. She said those teams needed greater \u201cflexibility\u201d however, and could embed with Kurdish and Iraqi forces. The former secretary of state said she would directly arm Kurds and Sunni tribes if Baghdad refused to do so, saying the war required \u201ca second Sunni awakening\u201d after the alliance of tribes that took on al-Qaida in Iraq in the mid-2000s. Clinton sharply rebuked longstanding US allies, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for letting old enmities get in the way of cooperation \u2013 and by extension letting Syria collapse into chaos. She said she would press the Turks to stop bombing Kurds in Syria and regain control of their border, and that she would push the Gulf states to refocus on Syria by appealing to their concerns of Iranian influence. Northern Syrian needs a no-fly zone, enforced by the coalition and with Russian cooperation, according to Clinton, and Europe and its Middle East allies need an \u201cintelligence surge\u201d to direct air strikes and ground operations. European allies need to better coordinate with each other and the US over information, Clinton said, in particular over surveilling western-born fighters. Similarly, she said Silicon Valley companies should not view the US government \u201cas the enemy\u201d and should design encryption tools that the state can access \u2013 a nod to the demands of security chiefs. She said such tools should respect privacy but did not say how. Clinton also excoriated Republican demands that the US screen Syrian refugees by religion, or reject them entirely. Such rhetoric alienates US allies she said, and \u201cplays into [terrorists\u2019] hands\u201d. \u201cWe are in a conflict of ideas against an ideology of hate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut let me clear, Islam is not our adversary,\u201d The former adviser to Barack Obama also distanced herself from the president, saying she would have armed Syrian rebels at the start of the civil war, to bring down Bashar al-Assad. She also subtly criticized his comment in recent weeks that Isis was \u201ccontained\u201d within Syria and Iraq, saying containment could not work alone. Zakaria closes out the Q&amp;A session to a smattering of applause and the audience of foreign policy experts and reporters rise to take cellphone photos of Clinton. We\u2019ll have a summary up of her speech and remarks shortly. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to decimate Isis in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Clinton says, but she stresses that that does not mean a large number of US forces, which would only \u201ccomplicate\u201d a campaign against Isis. Instead the US needs to actively do more for the Kurds, press coalition allies to refous on Syria, and encourage \u201ca second Sunni awakening \u2026 and that requires a lot of political pressure put on Baghdad\u201d. Right now we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground and get them to change their priorities and work together. She says she advocates a no-fly zone over northern Syrian near the border, and would hope to cobble some agreement together with Russia to protect it. Cutting off the supply lines, trying to supply some refuges for refugees \u2026creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and other bombardments \u2026 and I would certainly hope to work with the Russians to do that \u2026 The Russians as you know have been primarily focused on Assad\u2019s enemies and not on Isis, and I think that has changed, I think there\u2019s an indication that has changed. She says that Assad needs to understand \u201cthat what happens to him will be part of a political solution\u201d. But Clinton does not broach some of the logistical problems of such a \u201cswath of territory that could be a safe zone\u201d, for instance the issue of policing who comes in and out of the territory and the danger of it being exploited by a haven for terrorist groups. Clinton doesn\u2019t shy from saying that she wanted to arm rebels who were fighting Assad back in 2011, and that she understand it\u2019s much more difficult to \u201cdraw lines\u201d and track where arms go when trying to train and equip rebels at this later, more chaotic stage of the civil war. I\u2019ve said many times I can\u2019t predict what would\u2019ve happened if we\u2019d have moved earlier, if it would\u2019ve worked, if it might not\u2019ve worked. \u201cThere is not going to be a successful military [point] to overturn Assad,\u201d she says. It has to be done politically. \u201cWe had an opportunity, perhaps, but right no we\u2018ve got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians, perhaps Hezbollah, we\u2019ve got to get the common [fight] against Isis.\u201d Someone in the audience asks about the Trans Pacific Partnership, a sweeping trade agreement that has found strong opposition among Democrats. \u201cThe final language of the treaty itself didn\u2019t meet\u201d the standards Clinton sets for evaluating agreements, she says. \u201cDoes it help to create good paying jobs in America, does it raise incomes, does it [improve] national security?\u201d She frames this re-evaluation as justification for her flip-flop on the treaty, which she had previously supported. Zakaria asks about Republican suggestions of letting Christian refugees into the US but treating Muslims differently. Clinton rejects it. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have a religious test for bringing refugees into our country.\u201d \u201cSo far we know that trying to vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, looking to see what organization, often a faith based organization might sponsor them,\u201d is a proven model, she says. The moderator notes that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have dropped of coalition bombing raids and shifted their attention to Yemen, where a civil war has spiraled into an international conflict and, arguably, a proxy war with Iran. Clinton again puts faith in diplomacy. Noting the contradictory interests of nations in the region, she says that the US needs to treat both Yemen and Syria as larger challenges involving Iran. \u201cWhat you\u2019re facing in Yemen could be a limited preview of what we could face going forward, unless we make a concerted effort to stop the fighting and get all the various groups [to make an effort toward peace talks and have a voice].\u201d Each problem needs consideration \u201con their own as well as bigger trends\u201d, she says. Zakaria points out that past and present Pentagon leaders have said a no-fly zone is not a good idea at this stage. Clinton politely disagrees: \u201cI believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again as a coalition and not as an America only\u201d situation. How she would convince coalition forces to enforce the no-fly zone \u2013 and how she would convince Russia and Iran to stop flying in support of Bashar al-Assad \u2013 goes unsaid. Asked about whether Obama underestimated Isis by calling them the \u201cjunior varsity\u201d of terrorists, Clinton says Isis has \u201chad an evolution\u201d and increased its capabilities. She concurs that her foreign policy thinking has tacked with Obama\u2019s over the years: \u201cWe largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited.\u201d But she says she disagreed with him about faster intervention in Syria around the start of the civil war, and that she wanted to arm opposition forces. \u201cThere were some [moderates back] then\u201d. Zakaria asks Clinton how her strategy for the campaign in Syria differs from Barack Obama\u2019s. She says her plain entails \u201cintensification and acceleration of the [air strike] strategy, but it also has to intensify [in] the other parts of the strategy.\u201d That means arming Sunni tribes and Kurds even if Baghdad doesn\u2019t want to, she says, as well as convincing allies to bomb Isis more and to target finances and travel routes. Finally she tells an anecdote about granting citizenship and the values that represents versus the wholesale rejection of those values by extremists. The speech ends, and she sits down with moderator Fareed Zakaria. Clinton lays down something like a\u201csmart power\u201d doctrine, to use her words. We have to use every pillar of American power, military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly, our values. That is smart power. We have to work with partners, like the EU, the Arab League and the UN. She says the US should have faith in \u201cold-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy\u201d and never be afraid to act alone, using the example of the raid on bin Laden (and not the invasion of Iraq). \u201cSince Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debating than how to address Syrian refugees seeking asylum in the United States,\u201d Clinton goes on, excoriating Republican comments on blocking or tracking refugees. She notes the grueling refugee vetting process, and takes up president Obama\u2019s comments that rejecting refugees contradicts American principles. \u201cDiscriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that\u2019s just not who we are.\u201d \u201cMany of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists\u201d that the US is fighting, she says. \u201cWe should be doing more to [ameliorating] this crisis, not less.\u201d Clinton broaches the question of security vs privacy, but merely lays out two sides of the argument: law enforcement doesn\u2019t like encryption, lots of other people do. We need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary \u2026 to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy. Now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack. She doesn\u2019t say how to strike a balance. She moves on to the problem of domestic terrorism and radicalization, and says that European nations are far behind the US in terms of sharing intelligence and counterterror coordination. \u201cAnd here at home we face a number of our own challenges. The threat of airline security is [changing] as terrorists develop new devices \u2026 Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans. This should go without saying, but in the current climate this bears repeating. Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines against [terrorism and radicalization]. The strategy of targeting terrorist financing, cyberspace, and blocking foreign fighters is necessary to defeating not only Isis but \u201cdefusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that,\u201d Clinton says. Next Clinton says the US needs to ramp up its efforts online to counter terrorist groups, saying that online territory should be treated exactly the same geographical territory. The government should do more, she says, and \u201csocial media companies can do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.\u201d Offline or online, we are in a contest of ideas.\u201d But Clinton rebukes comments by many Republicans that the US is at war with \u201cradical Islam\u201d: \u201cMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\u201d \u201cWe are in a conflict of ideas against an ideology of hate... but let me clear, Islam is not our adversary,\u201d added Clinton. \u201cThe obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilizations, or repeating the word Islamic terrorism, isn\u2019t just a distraction, it plays into their hands by alienating people we need by our sides.\u201d The kind of rhetoric used by some conservatives \u201cplays exactly into [terrorists\u2019] hands by alienating partners we need at our side,\u201d Clinton says, even though she acknowledges a \u201cdistorted\u201d extremist \u201cstrain\u201d of Islam. In the end it didn\u2019t matter what kind of terrorist that we called bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden.\u201d \u201cWe have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks,\u201d she says, and the US needs to press its allies to crack down on individual financing. And once and for all the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations, as well as the schools and mosques around the world \u2026 where recruitment happens in clusters.\u201d Clinton moves on to disrupting international terror cells, saying that although there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about Isis in the last week, al-Qaida remains the most sophisticated network. \u201cMost urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually to return home radicalized and battle-hardened.\u201d She says information sharing is a high priority, as is getting Turkey to \u201cfinally lock down its border\u201d. \u201cWe also have to be smart and target interventions that have the greatest impact,\u201d using people smugglers and Isis transporters as an example. \u201cWe cannot deal with Iran and Isis as two separate\u201d questions, Clinton continues, saying that regional politics amount to US national security interests. Raising the cost to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against Isis. She says the US needs to redouble its commitment to allies to send the message that \u201cthe time for delay is over, we should get this done\u201d \u2013 a rebuke to Obama\u2019s reluctance to intervene in Syria. She says greater cooperation with the Turks, including arms and intelligence, is necessary to resolving the Syrian civil war and defeating Isis. Countries like Jordan have offered more and frankly we should take them up on it. Our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up. \u2026 So far Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than countering Isis, and to be fair Turkey has a long and painful history [with the Kurds], We need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling Isis, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against Isis. Clinton moves on to Syria, saying that although she supports Obama\u2019s line that the nation requires a political transition away from Assad, it also needs greater military intervention. \u201cThe viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad, who let us remember has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should retool and ramp up our efforts to sppotr and equip viable Syrian opposition units. Our increased support should go hand in hand with our increased support from our Sunni and Arab coalition forces. We should also work with the opposition and our allies to enforce no-fly zones. She adds that special forces could be involved in the war, and says that \u201cRussia and Iran have to fess up\u201d that supporting Assad is making things worse. \u201cThere is an important role for Russia to help,\u201d she says, immediately after calling out Vladimir Putin by name. \u201cThere is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to [continue under] Assad\u2019s rule.\u201d Clinton says the US can and should support regional forces, even though \u201cthe Iraqi national army has struggled, and its going to take more work to get them up to shape.\u201d She says American forces may need \u201cGreater mobility and flexibility\u201d including embedding with Iraqi unites. Even so, she continues, it will take Sunnis to come together to fight back, as they did during the Iraqi civil war. But those militias were \u201cbetrayed\u201d by former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, she says. \u201cBaghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against Isis. But if Baghdad won\u2019t do that, the coalition should do so directly.\u201d She says her strategy has three main points. Defeat Isis in Syria, Iraq and the middle East Destory infrastructure of terrorist infrastructure \u201cHarden\u201d our resolve domestically The first prong of the streagy \u201cStarts with a more effective coalition campaign\u201d, involving more bombing and greater intelligence. \u201cArab speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East\u201d and stronger partnerships. \u201cOur goal should be to achieve the penetration\u201d that the US managed \u201cwith al-Qaida in the past\u201d. An air campaign is necessary but insufficient, she continues, but \u201clike president Obama I do not believe we should again have 100,000 troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart\u201d option. \u201cAt the heart\u201d of modern terrorism is Isis, Clinton continues. A physical enclave in Iraq and Syria, an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond, and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three.\u201d She says \u201cour goal is not to contain and deter Isis\u201d but to defeat and destroy Isis, a backhand at remarks last week by Barack Obama. She says the US must also \u201cpursue the long-game\u201d, involving a \u201cgenerational struggle against an ideology with deep roots.\u201d \u201cThis is a worldwide fight and America must lead it.\u201d Hillary Clinton takes the podium, beginning her speech. \u201cI wanted to come here to our city which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism to talk about the events of the last week,\u201d Clinton begins. \u201cOur allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now it\u2019s our turn.\u201d She says we face the same adversaries, and must show the same determination. \u201cEvery society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world\u2019s great democracies can\u2019t turn our backs on those in need.\u201d Hillary Clinton is due any minute on stage in New York, where CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and my colleague Lauren Gambino (@lgamgam) are in the room waiting. Donald Trump would not rule out tracking Muslim Americans in a database or giving them \u201ca special form of identification that noted their religion\u201d, Yahoo news reports in a long interview with the Republican presidential candidate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSome people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule.\u201d He said he would consider warrantless searches of Muslims and increased surveillance of mosques. \u201cCertain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look at the mosques. We\u2019re going to have to look very, very carefully.\u201d Earlier this week Trump suggested police surveillance of Mosques, and praised a controversial program by the NYPD to spy on Muslims as \u201cgreat\u201d. He said he would consider former NYPD police commissioner Ray Kelly, who led that program, for a cabinet position. Hello and welcome to a busy day in American politics. Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, and her biggest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, are due to lay out competing plans to defeat Islamic State extremists in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. Sanders has also promised to explain to voters what he means by his self-declared philosophy of democratic socialism. The Republican frontrunners are rambling through key states trying to nudge each off the top of the polls. Ben Carson is in Alabama, meeting with voters before an afternoon event, and Donald Trump is holding a rally and town hall in Iowa. Among the 12 other candidates, ascendent senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have sparred over military spending, and former governor Jeb Bush is pressing hawkish opinions about war in the Middle East. The stump speeches and major policy announcements promise an eclectic day: the bickering of election season along with serious questions reflecting a troubled world. The Democrats will announce their foreign policy plans only hours after France confirmed that a ferocious police raid in Paris killed Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected organizer of last week\u2019s horrific terrorist attack in the city. And Republicans will argue about extremism and religion as governors around the US resist accepting Syrian refugees. Barack Obama has criticized the governors for their \u201coffensive and hysterical\u201d reactions to the refugee crisis, and promised to veto a bill that would increase screening on top of the year the US already requires. Here\u2019s how the day is due to unfold: At 10.30am ET, the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, Hillary Clinton will speak about terrorism ahead of her foreign policy speech. My colleague Lauren Gambino (@LGamGam) is in the room and will file dispatches here. At 2pm ET, Georgetown University in Washington, Bernie Sanders will speak about his own foreign policy ideas and his vision of democratic socialism. Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) will on campus. At 4pm ET in Newtown, Iowa, Donald Trump will hold a town hall to answer voters\u2019 questions and then hold a \u201cMake America Great Again Rally\u201d. At 4pm ET at the University of South Alabama, Ben Carson will hold a political rally after a day of visiting Mobile schools and meeting with the press. Somewhere in there, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to approve a measure aimed to block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entry to the US without a strict background check. (Barack Obama has said he will veto it.) My colleagues Ben Jacobs and David Smith will be up on Capitol Hill with the latest. Meanwhile, follow along for all of that plus more from the other candidates on the trail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
