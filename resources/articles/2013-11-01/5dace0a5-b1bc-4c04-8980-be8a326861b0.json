With expectations low, Sir Malcolm Rifkind and his posse gave a masterclass in deference. So the credibility bar facing Keith Vaz's home affairs select committee is hardly high. One area they might discuss is recruitment, for the security services always need good people. Even now MI5 seeks someone \"with proven IT experience motivated by the opportunity to operate in a unique, complex and rewarding environment\". Its ad offers a \"chance to \"shape the technology behind the intelligence\". There is this bright techie ... a chap called Snowden. A few visa issues to deal with though. \u2022 More on the coalition's eureka-like discovery that it doesn't have to answer quite reasonable freedom of information requests if it can cite prohibitive cost. The worse the public finances, the more officials are able to draw a veil. Lord Kennedy of Southwark didn't think he was asking the earth. How many FoI requests turned down since the formation of the coalition have subsequently been upheld on appeal and complied with, asked the peer. \"To obtain this information we would have to ask each central government body to investigate the outcome of each appeal individually,\" lamented justice minister Lord McNally. \"Therefore it would only be possible to provide this information at disproportionate cost.\" \u2022 For there is right to know, and need to know. The two seem to converge less frequently. From the Sunday Times, news that the Met seeks to uphold its right to chase after the contents of reporter's notebooks when it suits, and conduct the judicial ferreting process in secret. Why is it going to those lengths? Because the courts quashed an earlier ruling in its favour against Sky News. Consequently, the Met's inability to ferret in secret is \"having a significant impact on current police investigations \u2026 in particular those involving national security\". Ah yes, that national security card. Never knowingly underplayed. \u2022 Mourning here as elsewhere for John Cole, a former deputy editor of the Guardian, who went on to become the political editor's political editor when Thatcher was in her pomp. Much respect too at Cole's old school, Belfast Royal Academy, which featured him prominently on its website as a famous old boy. This was not an honour given lightly. Another famous former pupil and contemporary of Cole's, who also rose to the very top of his chosen profession, died earlier this year. But for some reason the website makes no mention of the death of that other former pupil: Peter Scott, better known as \"king of the cat burglars\" and \"the human fly\", who made \u2013 and lost \u2013 an estimated \u00a330m burgling the rich. Were they less proud of him than Cole? Hondootedly! \u2022 An interesting diary date: the annual breaking of bread by the Nuclear Industry Association in a swanky London hotel on 5 December. Drinks, dining, networking and an after-dinner turn by the BBC's Jeremy Vine. Can that be right, ask anti-nuclear types, citing rules on impartiality? Yes, says the BBC. It's fine under the guidelines. And it's all good. When Panorama targets the energy giants, he can point them out. \u2022 Let's end on good news for the BBC, whose Simon Schama series The Story of the Jews endured a turbulent reception. \"Given up on Simon Schama's TV series. Won't waste more time watching him traipse around places where Jews have lived. Reading his book,\" tweeted Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, on 8 September. But as the series progressed, Pollard warmed to it, as evidenced by further tweets. And this weekend, with a letter offering Chronicle subscribers the chance to see Schama interviewed by Pollard himself, the editor's journey was complete. \"Truly extraordinary: informative, moving, compelling,\" was his verdict on the series. Critics to the left of it, critics to the right. The Beeb has learned the long game. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
