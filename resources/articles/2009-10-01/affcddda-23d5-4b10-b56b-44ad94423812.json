Littlejohn declined an invitation, but nothing is set in stone. One or two of those scheduled to appear could always develop colds, swine flu, dropsy and the like. Politely withdraw. Labour leftie Colin Burgon MP points out that for all the BNP's claims to working-class credentials, there's a bitter refuse workers' strike in Leeds right now and only Labour activists have shown any solidarity. What's the problem for the BNP, he says? Could it be the fact that some of the pickets are black? What the Question Time situation calls for, argues Burgon, is a passionate class warrior who can demolish phoney racist arguments in a manner most likely to make Griffin, a Cambridge graduate, most uncomfortable. Step forward the RMT union's very own bruiser, Bob Crow. End the dinner party debate. Cue the war of words. So how much can we trust this, the latest list of citizens aligned to those who would make common cause with European extremists and the Ku Klux Klan? To quote Evelyn Waugh: up to a point, Lord Copper. For while it is for those named on Wikileaks to comment on the list's veracity, what we can tell you is that the roll call still contains the name of Ian Campbell. On the face of it \u2013 and this is a white face, obviously \u2013 Ian Campbell served as the BNP's central London organiser for seven months. But in reality Ian Campbell does not exist. That was the pseudonym used by our own senior reporter Ian Cobain when he went undercover to expose Griffin and his friends in 2006. They have had three years to amend the listing but they haven't bothered. Are all the other names real? For truth telling isn't their strongest suit. Witness a widely circulated email from Griffin yesterday. \"Former Bank Robber Accuses the BNP of Breaking the Law\", it said. This refers to the Welsh secretary Peter Hain, a vehement, dogged critic of the far right, who was famously charged with a bank robbery in October 1975, famously acquitted at the Old Bailey and famously judged to have been the victim of mistaken identity at best, a frame-up at worst. Someone in the BNP bunker presumably realised the headline was not just wrong but also very defamatory, and so the email was reissued 10 minutes later. This time the Welsh secretary was damned, just as dubiously, as a \"bank robbery suspect\". One might reasonably expect the BNP to know the difference between conviction and acquittal. Its followers spend enough time in court. On this issue of accuracy, what are we to make of revelations from writer Mary Kenny, that Princess Margaret, far from believing that the Irish are pigs \u2013 as was alleged by the mayor of Chicago \u2013 loved them really? Such was her love that, according to the author in her book, Crown and Shamrock, Margaret went on a secret pub crawl in Dublin with her husband Lord Snowdon. \"They went on a drinking spree with Brendan Behan, and Margaret described it as hilarious. She loved the Irish so that's why I don't believe she ever described them as pigs,\" Kenny told the Daily Mail. And perhaps that's right. Maybe Margaret never said it. But the Mail's version says the booze-up happened in 1965 when we know that Brendan Behan died in 1964. So who knows? Finally, for a learned man who has visited France so often and graced so many festivals, one might expect Clint Eastwood to have at least a working grasp of the lingo; but he knows just one colloquialism, he told the Lyon Film Festival this week. \"Et mon cul, c'est du poulet\", which means, \"And my arse is chicken\". It's a French version of \"pull the other leg\"; but worry not, for Clint (pictured), an accomplished pianist, still has the ability to learn new things when he puts his mind to it. He's just 79. There's still time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
