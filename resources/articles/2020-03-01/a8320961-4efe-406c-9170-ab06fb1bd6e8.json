Across the city that hosts the biggest, noisiest derby there is, the Real Betis goalkeeper Joel Robles was preparing food and bed for his daughter, who is six months old. For 90 minutes, they like to say, the whole of Seville stops. This time it stopped for much longer, and so did the rest of Spain. How much longer, no one knows. Torres and Robles were due to face each other on Sunday night, but the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n stood empty and so did the streets, bar the occasional police car passing to ensure no-one was out. The country was on lockdown because of coronavirus. There was effectively a curfew only this one was all hours and so they, like everyone else, were stuck at home. Betis striker Borja Iglesias and Sevilla defender Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, though, did face each other: from their sofas, online and on Fifa, they played the derby. Broadcast live, Betis won and Borja scored, which was convenient. Sixty thousand people tuned in to watch. There was nothing else to do. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest game of the year, for the city, for all our fans, and it would have started at nine,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI\u2019m at home, thinking about what might have been,. What I would be feeling, what would have been happening, all those people supporting you. You miss football anyway, so imagine a game like this. This was a magic moment for me: it was going to be the first time I lived the Seville derby at the Pizju\u00e1n.\u201d But the stadium, like all the rest, was empty. Like everywhere, in fact. In Madrid, children had been sent home from class on Wednesday and soon the rest of the country followed. Schools and stadiums: made to be full, noisy and alive, there may be no building on earth that feels more wrong when there\u2019s no one inside, like skeletons. Kids were off school and it was sunny out so to start with they went where they were always going to go. Which meant that the next day, parks were closed too. Another space that shouldn\u2019t be silent, melancholy expressed in police tape around a playground. There\u2019s probably no greater playground than a football ground. On Wednesday, Valencia had played in an empty stadium against Atalanta \u2013 a brilliant game that felt like no game at all \u2013 and Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s visit to Liverpool was the last normal game for some time, maybe even this season, although the president of the league, Javier Tebas, says he is convinced they will find a way to complete it. The initial idea had been for this weekend\u2019s La Liga games to go ahead behind closed doors. But things happened fast, and not just in football, so those doors closed to players too. Just like front doors all over the country. Three hundred people are dead, which makes even discussing the rest of it feel absurd and the idea that there could have been games plain bizarre. \u201cPlayers can think \u2018we\u2019re young, it probably won\u2019t affect us,\u2019 but we all have to think of people with illnesses, people who are older,\u201d Robles says. Nor are they immune, sportsmen suddenly made mortal. Or a little more mortal, anyway. Real Madrid\u2019s training ground was vacated and locked down after a basketball player tested positive, the team sent home on Thursday. Valencia have five positive cases, three of them players: Ezequiel Garay, Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e1 and Eliaquim Mangala. Alav\u00e9s have two among the staff: the players will all be tested on Monday. It\u2019s not in their hands. Asked on Thursday what happens now, one first division coach summed it up: \u201cGod knows.\u201d On Friday, players were sent home. Coaches were too. Most were told it would be two weeks at least. One first division club is, supposedly, returning to training on Tuesday. They won\u2019t. Games will not return for at least two weeks, and increasingly people wonder if they will return at all this season. There are few real expectations at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s 15 days to start with and then it will depend on the analyses made by the health authorities, on the numbers,\u201d Robles says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the football: it\u2019s about people, health. It\u2019s beyond us.\u201d The general population had already been asked to work from home if possible. Footballers did so, and encouraged others to follow. There were videos from their houses. Sergio Ramos on a treadmill. Takashi Inui doing kick ups in his living room. Iago Aspas watching Paw Patrol. \u201cNow is the time to be responsible,\u201d Lionel Messi tweeted. \u201cStay at home,\u201d Diego Simeone said, and when he says something you do it. The Real Sociedad defender Diego Llorente, like others, was reminding people that this isn\u2019t a holiday. At first some, lamentably, seemed to be treating it as such. Some departed cities heading for the coast. No more. There are army vehicles on the roads. This is real, even if it remains surreal. The numbers are terrifying \u2013 not least because no one believes they are the real numbers. How could they be? And how, and when, does this end? It sounds daft but you don\u2019t expect the apocalypse on a glorious sunny day. It was lovely out, but you couldn\u2019t be there. Police cars circulated slowly. Take the rubbish out, spend 30 seconds beyond the confines of your front door, and you feel like a fugitive so you scurry home fast. That was Sunday \u2013 although a lot of it broke down again on Monday as many made their way to \u201cessential\u201d work, making so much of the weekend\u2019s precaution seem pointless. Everyone was inside. Spain is also the noisiest country in the world, or so they say, which made the silence louder. \u201cThese are strange days,\u201d Torres says. \u201cIt creates a kind of psychosis because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and you\u2019ve never experienced a situation like this.\u201d Some came together even as they were forced apart. All across the country there are videos of blocks where from balconies and windows they sing songs, play games, shout across to each other. At 10pm on Saturday and Sunday, what would have been half time in Celta-Villarreal and the Seville derby, people came to their balconies and applauded doctors, nurses and health professionals, underpaid and underresourced heroes. Text messages are filled with daft jokes \u2013 which quickly dry up when positives are confirmed in the group \u2013 as well as books to read, films to watch, series to download, things to do. Friends made great suggestions that will be enjoyable discoveries. Self-discovery too, perhaps. Is it silly to think we might be better after this? But, then, concentrating isn\u2019t easy when that phone is there at your side, news coming in, getting worse by the minute. Could that sporting addiction even be broken, football\u2019s grip slipping? Unlikely, and the evidence so far suggests not. It\u2019s too easy to say sport doesn\u2019t matter: it does matter, it does mean something, if only because we ascribe it meaning. It takes you someplace better. It fills our lives, and without it there is a hole there. Right now, everyone could so with something to fill that space. And football tried, even in the absence of games. On Saturday, Legan\u00e9s live-tweeted their match against Valladolid \u2013 a huge relegation six-pointer which didn\u2019t happen. It was a public service broadcast, designed to send a message too. Legan\u00e9s won, which Valladolid suspected they would and which they could afford to laugh about after, 90 minutes filled with something enjoyably silly. \u00d3scar scored the winner, \u201ctaking advantage of the social distancing\u201d advised because of the virus. The VAR intervened almost 30 times. Cadena Ser radio released commentary of the goal that wasn\u2019t and AS wrote a match report, thanking Legan\u00e9s for the laughs. God knows, everyone needed it. Other clubs did similar things, social media taking them into homes that people couldn\u2019t leave. Real Oviedo replayed their 1992 win over Madrid. Better times. Asked how he was getting on, the captain of a first division club said: \u201cday one, fine \u2026 let\u2019s see on day 15.\u201d Another admitted he was climbing the walls already. Like anyone else, footballers get bored, maybe even more so. Sportsmen don\u2019t do sedentary. So, what do they do? \u201cWatch series, read a bit, try to find a way of making use of the time,\u201d Torres says. \u201cMy daughter keeps me entertained,\u201d Robles says, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to get your mind around that you\u2019ll be stuck inside for 15 days, or more; it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m on Netflix and films and watching a lot of telly, just like anyone. I\u2019ve been going out onto the balcony too. You\u2019ve got to get some air, a bit of sunshine. It\u2019s not good to be indoors on the sofa all day.\u201d Clubs have sent training programmes. Legan\u00e9s even made theirs open to the public, the fitness coach Pol Llorente leading online sessions each morning. It\u2019s fun and the players are getting involved, joking and winding each other up, but it\u2019s not the same of course. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to lose muscle tone so you do some aerobic work, keep your strength up, because we have to be ready if and when they tell us we\u2019re starting again,\u201d Robles says. There\u2019s no goalkeeper training as such but it won\u2019t be long, he laughs, before he reaches the point when he gets his girlfriend to throw a ball at him and he\u2019s diving across the living room, making saves on the sofa. \u201cWe have to be responsible, look after ourselves, train as best we can,\u201d says Torres. \u201cAnd that includes your mind \u2013 that\u2019s important. The main thing is listen to the health authorities and stay at home because if they say that\u2019s the best thing, it\u2019s the best thing. It\u2019s a real pity to miss the derby but we have to work at home and be ready because hopefully it will be back \u2013 and we have to be back too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
