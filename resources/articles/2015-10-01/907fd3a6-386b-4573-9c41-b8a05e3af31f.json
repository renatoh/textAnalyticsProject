In the back, a pregnant woman we know as Adele lies bleeding and clearly distressed. \u201cRelax,\u201d a paramedic tells her. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there.\u201d The woman glances out of the window: the dam has given way to forest, the road\u2019s smooth tarmac has become rocky and uneven. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d asks the ambulance driver, clearly surprised by this change of scenery. The ambulance presses forwards, its headlights peering tentatively into the thick forest, but there\u2019s no road to speak of at all now, just a dead end. The woman\u2019s stomach begins to gurgle and pulsate. She gasps with pain, and blacks out. Rebonjour, The Returned. How we have missed your enigmatic ways. It\u2019s been over two years since we last paid a visit to the chilly Alpine town where the undead roam the streets and it\u2019s never not dusk. That\u2019s an absence that, in the quick-turnaround word of TV, is one of Chinese Democracy-like proportions. Indeed, if you want a sense of just how much the world has moved on since The Returned was last on our screens, consider this: on the same day that the show first aired on British TV, a whistleblower named Edward Snowden revealed that he was the person who leaked classified information from the NSA. (And that\u2019s just British screens: in France there was a gap of three years between Les Revenants\u2019 first and second seasons. ) Given just how long it has been, you might well expect L\u2019Enfant to gently ease the viewer back into the Returned\u2019s beguiling world, dropping in the odd reminder or flashback here and there to help us get us back up to speed. Not a bit of it. This is an episode heavy on ambience and ambiguity, and low on actual answers. It\u2019s a Gallic two fingers up to the notion of spoon-feeding your audience. Which is fair enough, really; the Returned would be a lesser show if it resorted to shoehorning huge chunks of exposition or telegraphed plot points into its wonderfully sparse and opaque style of storytelling. I just worry that audiences might struggle to regain their appetite for this sort of slow-burn mystery: already ratings in France are dramatically lower than for season one. Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s more of a hunger for it in the UK. \u2018I\u2019m from around here\u2019 Six months have passed since the flooding of the town and the disappearance both of \u201cthe horde\u201d of revenants and the gendarmes who confronted them outside the Helping Hand. Not much it seems has changed in that time \u2013 the town remains underwater, those people still haven\u2019t been found \u2013 but the troubling goings-on in Returnedville have at least caught the attention of some outsiders. The military have swarmed upon the town, placing it under lockdown. Meanwhile, a specialist by the name of Berg has arrived to try and figure out just what caused the flood. Already, I have my doubts about Berg. It\u2019s clear that he knows more about the situation in the town than he\u2019s letting on. The fact that he comes from the area is obviously a red flag, and there\u2019s something equally fishy about him claiming to have a new lead on the reason for the flood, but refusing to divulge it, even to the military. Indeed, with the spotlight of suspicion on Berg, every small detail seems telling. Is there something suspicious about the fact that he arrived in the town early than scheduled? (\u201cI made good time,\u201d he tells the army sergeant.) And was that a knowing glance between Berg and Pierre when they met at the hospital later on? It looked like mutual loathing to me. \u2018I don\u2019t want it to come out\u2019 Talking of mutual loathing, Adele and her unborn zombie baby don\u2019t look to be getting on terribly well, do they? In fact, both of them seem to be trying their damndest to do the other harm: Adele going as far as hurling herself down a flight of stairs to abort her child; the child violently kicking, causing violent contractions and \u2013 most worryingly of all \u2013 growing to a uncommonly large size in Adele\u2019s stomach. So large, in fact, that Adele is, according to her doctor, about to go into labour after only six months. I can\u2019t see this ending well. \u2018It\u2019s started again\u2019 Adele\u2019s child is not the only new revenant in town. Audrey, another victim of the coach crash that killed Camille, has returned. As has Serge\u2019s brother Toni, who took his own life at the end of the last series, and, most intriguingly, Victor\u2019s mother, who is reunited with her son here. \u201cIt\u2019s started again,\u201d says Lucy the barmaid, who we earlier saw transporting more revenants across the flooded section via rafts to the deserted side of the town. Clearly we have another influx on our hands, but why now? On the other side of the water the handful of people who didn\u2019t flee the town when the water came - notably Lena and Jerome \u2013 continue to search forlornly for the lost loved ones. \u201cThe dead are the living and the living are the dead\u201d, was how creator Fabrice Gobert described the tension at the centre of The Returned, going on to suggest that grief is itself a kind of death. Certainly, that tallies with what we see here: Lena spends her days in a soul-sapping cycle of going to and from the military barracks to ask for news of her sister and mother. Jerome, if anything, is in an even worse way, sporting a beard that screams \u201cdepression\u201d and not even bothering to communicate with the daughter he is actually able to speak to. Is there any way to break this bleak cycle? Notes and theories For anyone who missed it, here\u2019s Gabriel Tate\u2019s excellent on-location piece for this second season of the Returned. Victor\u2019s been drawing some more unpleasant pictures \u2013 this time of pregnant women with giant, distorted foetuses in their stomachs. A reference to Adele and child, perhaps? Great to hear Mogwai on soundtrack duties again. Why are the horde acting menacingly to Camille and Audrey? Claire told Audrey to keep quiet in their house \u201cotherwise they\u2019ll come\u201d. What was that creature Audrey briefly glimpsed in the forest? And was it the same thing that devoured the deer in the town centre? More bad news for those still living in the town: the terrible American diner is the only restaurant still open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
