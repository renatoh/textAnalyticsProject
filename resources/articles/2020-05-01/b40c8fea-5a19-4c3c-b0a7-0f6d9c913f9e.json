The Australian Communications and Media Authority ordered the 79-year-old to make an on-air correction about the climate change comments but found he has already apologised for his criticism of Ardern. Jones said on air on Thursday morning that he had incorrectly asserted that biomass is a fossil fuel. The Acma found he presented figures relating to Australia and New Zealand\u2019s percentage of energy use from solar and wind that were incorrect. The now infamous August 2019 broadcast \u2013 which led to an unprecedented advertiser boycott \u2013 attracted more than 125 complaints and was found to have \u201coffended against generally accepted community standards of decency\u201d. The offensive statements included: \u201cI just wonder whether Scott Morrison\u2019s going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat\u201d, \u201cNow I hope Scott Morrison gets tough here with a few backhanders\u201d, and \u201cI hope he goes for the throat this morning.\u201d Jones is retiring just one year into a two-year $8m contract with Nine Radio after an advertiser boycott stripped 50% of the show\u2019s revenue and caused the entire network to suffer. His advertisers were targeted by social media activists Sleeping Giants and Mad Fucking Witches after the Ardern comments last year. The Acma chair Nerida O\u2019Loughlin said the comments were not appropriate for public radio broadcasting in today\u2019s Australia. \u201cThe repeated use of violent metaphors by Mr Jones and his apparent encouragement of aggressive silencing of Ms Ardern was highly offensive and did not meet contemporary community expectations,\u201d O\u2019Loughlin said. \u201cThis was evident in the public display of outrage from the community, actions by advertisers and actions by then chairman of Macquarie Media who publicly stated any recurrence of this type of comment would result in the termination of Mr Jones\u2019 contract.\u201d Because Jones made an on-air and a written apology and received counselling from management, no further action was taken on the decency breaches. \u201cGiven the imminent retirement of Mr Jones from 2GB and the actions taken by Macquarie Media and Mr Jones at the time, the Acma is not taking further action against the licensee for breach of the decency rules,\u201d O\u2019Loughlin said. Jones did not use like-for-like data in his statements about climate change policy, the authority found, in contravention of the industry code which requires broadcasters to \u201cuse reasonable efforts to ensure the facts they are presenting are accurate\u201d. \u201cThe factual error and inconsistent information were used to incorrectly portray that Australia generates more of its energy from renewables than New Zealand,\u201d O\u2019Loughlin said. His retirement comes nine months after the station\u2019s management said Jones was on his final warning for offensive comments and took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly. Despite dominating breakfast radio in Sydney for 35 years, recording an unequalled 226 survey wins, his conduct on air has led to the radio station losing advertisers and haemorrhaging revenue. The incident will be used in staff training at 2GB, the authority said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
