The FTSE-100 closed down 100.1 points, or 2.2%, at 4,445.2. It was the index's steepest drop since last May, wiping some \u00a324bn off the value of top UK shares. Other European markets also suffered with the Paris Cac 40 off by 3% while in Frankfurt, the Dax lost 3%. Negative corporate news contributed to the gloom. British Airways fell 7.9% after saying its costs could rise by up to \u00a3400m in the year to end-March 2005, while insurer Royal &amp; Sun tumbled 15.5% after a 38% fall in its 2003 profits. US markets provided little support with Wall Street and the dollar losing ground following mixed economic data. The US government released figures showing that initial weekly jobless claims fell in line with expectations. Retail sales rose, but the gains were confined to cars and department store sales, according to the commerce department. By mid-morning, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 53.6 points, or 0.5%, at 10,243.2. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was off 6.5 points, or 0.5%, at 1,117.3 and the technology-focused Nasdaq was down 5.2 points, or 0.2%, at 1,958.9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
