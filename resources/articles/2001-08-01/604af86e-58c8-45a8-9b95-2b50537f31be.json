Monks Partnership, a subsidiary of accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers, surveyed salaries and bonuses at the FTSE 100 index of blue chip companies. It found that chief executives earned an average of \u00a3539,000 in basic salaries over the last 12 months, a 14.9% jump on last year's figure. And it was not just salaries: bonuses also rose, averaging 46.9% of base salary, compared with 39.7% the year before. Yet despite the scale of the increases, Monks Partnership consultant and report editor David Atkins said they should be put into context. He said: \"We are looking at these increases through the eyes of August 2001, which is a very different market from one or two years ago when these pay levels were set.\" He added that the hikes reflected consolidation in most sectors and a \"shortage of individuals with skill and experience to manage businesses which increasingly are global\". Today's report also found that chief executives working in the consumer goods sector were paid the highest - they received an average of \u00a31,066,000 including bonuses and benefits. Those working for utilities were paid the least, with an average of \u00a3597,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
