Relying on the transcripts of recordings provided by the Turkish authorities, the report describes how Jamal Khashoggi went to the Saudi consulate in Turkey by appointment on 2 October last year, to obtain papers he needed to pave the way for his marriage to his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. Saudi Arabia had been trying to get him to return from the US, where he worked as a journalist for the Washington Post, but he feared for his safety. The report relies on recordings of conversations within the consulate in the days prior to his death, which show how a team of Saudi officials flew from Riyadh to Istanbul to kill him. Five came on a commercial flight, nine others on a private jet. In a recording from inside the consulate on 1 October, one man was recorded saying: \u201cA commission is coming from Saudi Arabia tomorrow. They have something to do in the consulate \u2026 Their work inside will take two or three days.\u201d There were discussions that day about a farmhouse in Yalova, a city on the coast of the Sea of Marmara, and its isolated position. When an official is told \u201cthere is nobody there \u2026 just a caretaker\u201d, he replies, \u201cVery nice.\u201d The report then outlines conversations that took place shortly before Khashoggi arrived at the Turkish consulate on the day he died. One Saudi official asked whether it would \u201cbe possible to put the trunk in a bag\u201d. Another replied: \u201cNo. Too heavy. It is not a problem. The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished. We will wrap each of them.\u201d Khashoggi entered the consulate at 1.15pm, the report says. He was invited to the office of the consul general located on the second floor. According to recordings, the conversation with him first focused on whether he would go back to Saudi Arabia. An official told him: \u201cWe will have to take you back. There is an order from Interpol. Interpol requested you to be sent back. We are coming to get you.\u201d He was asked about his two phones and told to type a message, which he refused to do, the special rapporteur says. According to the recordings, Khashoggi said: \u201cWhat should I say? See you soon? I can\u2019t say kidnapping. I will not write anything.\u201d An official then said to him: \u201cType it, Mr Jamal. Hurry up. Help us so that we can help you because at the end we will take you back to Saudi Arabia and if you don\u2019t help us you know what will happen at the end; let this issue find a good end.\u201d At 1.33pm, Khashoggi could be heard saying: \u201cThere is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?\u201d \u201cWe will anaesthetise you,\u201d came a reply. In the recordings, sounds of a struggle can be heard, the UN report says, and then voices saying: \u201cDid he sleep? \u2026 Keep pushing \u2026 Push here. Don\u2019t remove your hand. Push it.\u201d The report adds: \u201cThe sound of plastic sheets (wrapping) could also be heard. Turkish intelligence concluded that these came after Mr Khashoggi\u2019s death while the Saudi officials were dismembering his body.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
