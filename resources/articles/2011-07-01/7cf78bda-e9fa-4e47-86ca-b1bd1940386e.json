The present government is no exception. A white paper on public services reform, originally due to be published in January, was delayed on numerous occasions. It has now been published on 11 July [see footnote]. Part of the reason for the delay has been a rethink about what reform and modernisation would entail. Outsourcing public services to the private sector has been used by many previous governments as a way to cut costs and use private sector expertise for specific projects. In 2007, for instance, the Home Office tendered contracts worth up to \u00a3500m each for its identity card scheme. Private sector companies are now a familiar fixture in public service delivery, from Aspire, the \u00a39.75bn IT services contract at HM Revenue &amp; Customs, run by Capgemini, to IBM running London's congestion scheme. So it would not have been surprising to expect the present government, in its search for budget cuts, to turn once again to the private sector. But although outsourcing to private firms will still form a big part of the government's plans, a leaked memo in May from John Cridland, director general of employers' organisation the CBI, revealed concern that large-scale outsourcing of public services to the private sector would be politically \"unpalatable\" \u2013 in part due to pressure from the Liberal Democrats, who want to see more focus on services being delivered by small, local organisations, rather than large private firms. Many public services are already delivered by charities or social enterprises, mainly in health and social care, including rehabilitation and care services, and many charities already get a high level of their income from contracts with either local or central government bodies. The government now wants to award more work to such organisations, to form a \"mixed economy\" of public services. Hilary Thompson, chair of the Commissioning Support Programme and chief executive of the Office for Public Management, says public bodies are increasingly moving away from direct provision of services, but points out that when an authority wishes to shift delivery of services out of its control, that decision needs to be supported by good commissioning practice if it is to lead to sustainable services and improved results. \"Effective commissioning is agnostic about who provides services and what sector they are from,\" she says. \"It is a set of principles and procedures that, properly applied, can ensure the most effective and efficient use of all available resources.\" But the agenda is not just about commissioning and outsourcing; the search for efficiency also includes a greater use of shared services across government, more efficient procurement, and the precious, but so far elusive, aim of pooling all public sector spending in a specific area, to avoid duplication. In its search for different delivery models, the government will no doubt be keen to learn from previous governments' work in this area; place-based budgeting is one good example. This approach, which aims to link local and national budgets with service requirements, holds considerable potential, and the Labour government ran a number of pilot schemes. In principle, a partnership approach between different government bodies should mean better-quality services for the public. The latest version of this approach, the present government's community budget programme, which now has 16 pilot schemes running in England, is intended to provide a more unified approach to social care, benefiting some of the country's most troubled, and resource-intensive, families. Diverse agencies The agencies involved in place-based budgets in different areas of the country are diverse, but typically they will include local authorities, the NHS, Jobcentre Plus, the police and schools. Each area will differ slightly in its approach, but as well as pooled funding, agencies are likely to create one point of contact for all services. The aim is clear, but there are real challenges in linking up local and national pots of public sector money in this way. One of the biggest challenges is whether such collaborative working will be driven from the centre of the government. Two years ago, a report on the previous government's operational efficiency programme stopped short of imposing any central mandate on government bodies to work in more collaborative ways, saying such collaboration would \"increase the flexibility of organisations right across the public sector to obtain procurement efficiencies from a range of available best-value deals\". This could be getting the best price for anything from office supplies to management consultancy fees. This government has a more urgent cost-cutting and reform programme, but, even so, it faces the same challenge as the agencies. The Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, who made procurement one of his early priorities in office, has set up the Efficiency and Reform Group to shave millions off the money spent with suppliers. He makes no bones about taking a brisk attitude to cutting down on the \u00a345bn budget of central government departments \u2013 earlier this year, Maude said he felt he'd earned his salary if he went home \"at the end of the day having saved a hundred million pounds, by dint of what I've done or led\". But even Maude, for all his determination, says only that other public bodies will be able to \"piggy back\" off these central deals, rather than be mandated to use central procurement systems. There are other barriers, too, that make it complex to improve procurement and outsourcing processes. In February, for instance, a highly critical report by the National Audit Office pointed out that the freedom enjoyed by foundation trusts \u2013 the model that would be adopted by all hospitals if the government implements its NHS reform plans \u2013 will prevent the Department of Health from mandating the use of centrally negotiated contracts. Leaving responsibility for improving procurement with trusts often results in overlapping contracts with the central deals, incurring unnecessary costs, according to the NAO. The report also pointed out that England's 165 hospital trusts could save \u00a3500m, at least 10% of their \u00a34.6bn spending on consumable supplies such as paper and medical gloves, if they improved their procurement practices. \u2022 The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 21 July 2011.
