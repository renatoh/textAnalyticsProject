Evelyn Beatr\u00edz Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, 21, was acquitted on Monday after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict. Prosecutors had asked for a 40-year prison sentence for aggravated homicide, but Hern\u00e1ndez has always maintained her innocence, insisting that she did not realise the rape had left her pregnant, and lost consciousness during the birth. \u201cThank God, justice was served,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez outside the courthouse, surrounded by jubilant supporters, after the verdict was handed down. \u201cI thank all of you who have supported me and thank everyone from around the world who has shown support.\u201d Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, described the verdict as a \u201cresounding victory for the rights of women in El Salvador\u201d. \u201cWe call on El Salvador to end the shameful and discriminatory practice of criminalising women once and for all by immediately revoking the nation\u2019s draconian anti-abortion laws,\u201d she said. Abortion has been outlawed in all circumstances in El Salvador since 1998. Since then, dozens of women have been prosecuted for murder after suffering an obstetric emergency such as miscarriage or stillbirth, and given sentences of between 30 and 40 years. Hern\u00e1ndez was raped in 2015, when she was an 17-year-old college student. She was remanded in custody in April 2016, three days after suffering the stillbirth. The medical coroner recorded aspiration pneumonia as the cause of death, having discovered meconium \u2013 faecal matter \u2013 in the baby\u2019s lungs and stomach. Despite the medical evidence pointing to complications at birth, she was convicted of aggravated homicide and sentenced to 30 years in July 2017. Hern\u00e1ndez was freed in February 2019, after serving 33 months, when an appeal court judge quashed the conviction on the grounds that the evidence used to convict her failed to prove she had deliberately harmed the baby. Nevertheless, prosecutors decided to pursue a retrial and longer jail term based on the same tenuous evidence. \u201cThe prosecution was never based on objective evidence \u2026 it was about the institutional systematic criminalisation of poor women,\u201d Bertha Mar\u00eda Dele\u00f3n, one of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, told the Guardian. The Hern\u00e1ndez case is the first since President Nayib Bukele took office in June, and will test his commitment to tackle the miscarriages of justice enabled by the country\u2019s draconian abortion laws and misogynistic justice system. Bukele, the country\u2019s youngest ever president, has yet to comment on the verdict, but has previously said that while he is anti-abortion, no woman should be jailed after suffering an obstetric emergency. Monday\u2019s ruling is the second major victory in eight months for lawyers and campaigners. In December 2018, Imelda Cortez, 20, charged with attempted murder after giving birth to her abusive step-father\u2019s baby, was freed after an international campaign highlighted her plight. \u201cWe are creating judicial precedents,\u201d said Paula Avila Guillen, director of Latin America initiatives at the New York-based Women\u2019s Equality Centre. \u201cThis is down to smart litigation and mobilising the media to focus the eyes of the world on El Salvador, which has forced judges to pay closer attention to the actual evidence rather than relying on prejudice and stigma surrounding poor women.\u201d In the last decade, 41 women have been freed as a result of dogged campaigning by domestic and international human rights groups, including six in 2018. At least 16 other women are serving up to 35 years in jail, with four more facing trial. \u201cIt was tough to be locked up, especially when I was innocent,\u201d added a tearful Hern\u00e1ndez on Monday. \u201cThere are others who are still locked up and I hope they are freed soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
