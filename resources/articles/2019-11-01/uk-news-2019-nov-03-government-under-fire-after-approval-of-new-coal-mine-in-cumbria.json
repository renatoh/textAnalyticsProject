The developer, West Cumbria Mining, said the \u00a3165m mine would create 500 jobs. The Cumbrian MP Tim Farron called the decision \u201ca kick in the teeth in the fight to tackle climate change\u201d. Farron had asked the government to \u201ccall in\u201d the decision after it received unanimous planning approval by Cumbria county council in March. But his application has been rejected, with the local Conservative MP Trudy Harrison saying \u201csense has prevailed\u201d. Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, expressed his dismay, saying the government should \u201cinvest fully in zero-carbon energy\u201d instead. He said: \u201cCumbria has so many renewable resources to provide energy \u2013 water, wind and solar \u2013 and we should most definitely not be taking the backwards step of opening a new coalmine.\u201d The news came as the government announced its net zero review, which will assess \u201chow we can cut our emissions without seeing them exported elsewhere\u201d. The mine, called Woodhouse Colliery, will be situated on the former Marchon industrial site near Whitehaven. It will extract coking coal from under the sea nearby, with access via the existing Sandwith Anhydrite mine portals, according to West Cumbria Mining. The company said site work should begin in early 2020, with coal production commencing two years later. It hopes to develop a mine that will produce 2m to 3m tonnes of hard metallurgical coal a year for around 50 years. Harrison said: \u201cThis is fantastic news. It is vital that this development goes ahead and I am pleased that common sense has prevailed. Woodhouse colliery has been recognised for its importance to the steel industry and to UK export. Coking coal is essential for the steel industry and this has been rightly recognised.\u201d Deep coalmining in the UK, a sector that employed more than 1 million people across several thousand pits a century ago, ceased in December 2015 with the closure of Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire. After Cumbria county council approved the mine in March, Geoff Cook, chair of the council\u2019s development control and regulation committee, said it had not been an easy decision. \u201cAll of us would prefer to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and we recognise that during construction there will be disruption to many local residents,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we felt that the need for coking coal, the number of jobs on offer and the chance to remove contamination outweighed concerns about climate change and local amenity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
