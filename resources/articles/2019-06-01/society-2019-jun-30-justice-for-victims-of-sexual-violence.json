Women who\u2019ve been attacked or harassed routinely find that when they report violence, they don\u2019t get justice. All too often, justice systems aren\u2019t properly set up or equipped to support survivors. ActionAid\u2019s own research on this issue globally bears that truth out, as do new statistics from UN Women, which reveal that in many countries regressive laws are holding women back from escaping domestic violence. At ActionAid, we also know from experience that women and girls in poverty are even more at risk \u2013 and again, this is a universal issue. When justice systems aren\u2019t properly equipped, survivors struggle to access legal aid or get the support they deserve from the police. Too many are left dealing with the emotional and physical impacts of the abuse on their own. Governments all around the world \u2013 the UK included \u2013 need to start listening to survivors and ensure that all women have access to the services they need, and the justice they deserve.
