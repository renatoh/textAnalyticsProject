The home crowd greet the final whistle with measured applause. Their team put in a tremendous effort and will fancy their chances of scoring an away leg, especially with Nabil F\u00e9kir back. Bar\u00e7a will be confident of netting in the Camp Nou too, of course, but they will have to finish better than they did here. Their precision continually abandoned them at the crucial moment and, in the end, they were thankful for a fabulous save by Ter Stegen, who pushed a shot by Terrier on to the crossbar in the first half. The second leg will be well worth following - and you\u2019ll be able to do that right here. See ya! 90+2: Barceloan try to walk it in but Lyon aren\u2019t about to allow that. In days gone by, Coutinho would settle this by lashing into the net from long range but he hasn\u2019t even tried that so far ... 90 min: Lyon will have to hang on for at least three more minutes ... 90 min: Messi dabs a feeble freekick into the wall and then rams the follow-up into it, too. The home fans jubilate! 89 min: A ridiculous, trademark run by Messi, slaloming between three defenders before being tripped at the edge of the area. Freekick in an ominous position, just outside the D ... 88 min: Semedo booked for pulling back Aouar after a fine run by the midfielder. 86 min: Messi thrashes another shot wide from a promising position. Bar\u00e7a just haven\u2019t had their shooting boots on today. 85 min: Messi runs to retrieve an overhit cross from the left, then picks out Busquets at the edge of the box. Busquets tries curl one into the net, but Lopes watch it all the way and tips it over the bar. He probably could have caught it but decided not to take the risk. 84 min: Suarez floats a cross from the right towards Coutinho. Dubois strains his neck to head clear. Lyon substitution: Cheikh Diop on, Ndombele off. 82 min: The effect of the away goal rule is interesting here: Barcelona are more eager to score as they know doing so now would swing the tie hugely in their favour; whereas the home team know that 0-0 would leave it tilted slightly their way, as an away goal in the Camp Nou would count double. 80 min: Roberto booked for kicking the ball away. And on that note, he\u2019s subbed off and replaced by Vidal. 77 min: Mendy is robbed on half way and suddenly Barcelona launch a dangerous attack, Suarez pinging a diagonal pass to Messi. Dubois does superbly to stop him from getting off a clear shot from 10 yards. 76 min: Coutinho lets fly from 20 yards. Lopes springs to his left and saves well. Lyon substitution: Here comes Cornet, in place of Terrier. 74 min: Alba, an increasing menace to Lyon, raids down the left and nips a cute ball into Suarez, who lunges at it and tries to poke it into the net from close range. But he didn\u2019t get a firm enough touch and Lopes is able to save. 73 min: Depay jinks past Semedo but then overhits his cross. 72 min: Barcelona starting to gain the upper hand. They\u2019re stretching Lyon more and more at the back but still can\u2019t find a sure touch when it really matters. 70 min: Ala picks out Suarez with a low cross from the left. The striker falls as he shoots first time ... and slashes the ball just wide from 18 yards! Lyon substitution: Tousart on, Traore off. No Cornet yet, then. Bruno Genesio probably thinking 0-0 isn\u2019t a bad result in the home leg. 68 min: Messi skitters through the Lyon defence, helped by a favourable ricochet. Then he tries to clip the ball over the advancing keeper. But the angle is too tight and the ball floats over the bar. Barcelona substitution: Coutinho on, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 off. 66 min: Messi swaps passes with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and then unloads a shot from a difficult angle on the left. Lopes bats it away. 65 min: A break in play as Roberto\u2019s receives treatment for a bloodied nose caused, accidentally, by Aouar\u2019s elbow. 62 min: Lyon spring forward on the counter. Depay plays in Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who beats Lenglet ... but Ter Stegen rusehs off his line to smother. 61 min: Depay whizzes down the left and flashes a cross into the danger zone. Ter Stegen cuts it out, spilling it the first time and then pouncing to retrieve. 60 min: Suarez goes down holding his head ... because the ball hit it. The ref is duped into awarding a freekick. 58 min: Semedo catches Mendy on the ankle, giving Lyon a freekick wide on the left. The crowd are peeved that none of these fouls by Barcelona are leading to yellow cards. And their anger deepens when Depay bogs the freekick way over the bar. 56 min: Alba finds Suarez in the box. But the Uruguayan\u2019s touch is off, and Denaye is quickly on him and relieves him of the ball. 54 min: Leglet, who has been unusually gauche today, whacks Depay from behind near halfway and somehow escapes a yellow card. 52 min: Alba challenges Traore on the left hand side of the Barcelona box. The ball squirts out to Depay, who aims a first-time curling shot towards the far post. It floats inches wide! 51 min: Smart positioning enables Marcelo to cut out a dangerous low cross from the left by Dembele. 49 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 presents the ball to Messi, running on to it outside the D. but Messi\u2019s first touch is unusually oafish, allowing Denayer to step in and clear. 47 min: Bar\u00e7a make the brighter start to the second period, pushing Lyon back and probing ... until Lenglet gives the ball away. \u201cIsn\u2019t Suarez just a yard or so too slow these days,\u201d ventures Paul Fitzgerald. \u201cIncredibly instinctive player but but seems to labour onto through balls I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d That\u2019s been the case so far today, at any rate. 46 min: No substitutions during the break. \u201cFear not, Paul, Traor\be will make way for Cornet in 25 minutes,\u201d prophesizes Ane Onyme. And then what? Another Cornet winner? An entertaining and high-class half despite the lack of goals. There was no shortage of attacking and plenty of foxy moves but the finishing has mostly been off. Lyon came closest to scoring but Terrier was denied by a wonderful save from Ter Stegen. But Barcelona generally looked more dangerous although both teams had periods of superiority. It\u2019s hard to see this ending scoreless. 45+1 min: Busquets\u2019 shot from the edge of the area takes a nick off Denayer ... and glides a yard wide. 45 min: Beautiful move by Lyon! A series of one-twos open up the Bar\u00e7a ... can Terrier provide the perfect finish? No! he cracks his shot wide from 15 yards. 43 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 collects a rolled pass from Messi near the edge of the Lyon box and then takes the keeper by surprise with a well disguised snapshot, Fortunately for Lyon it flashes just wide of the near post. 41 min: A rare mistake by Ndombele, who sends a pass straight to Sergi Roberto, who, in turn, release Suarez down the right. Suddenly Bar\u00e7a have 3 v 3. But Suarez\u2019s pass towards Dembele is too long. 40 min: Lenglet gets lucky as the ref rules that he\u2019s fouled by Depay, who rolled past him and sent Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 clear for what would have been a great chance. 38 min: Messi delivers a sumptuous cross from the left, but Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 gets his attempted volley all wrong. 35 min: Suarez tries to chip the keeper from just outside the area. But Lopez was practically on his line and not likely to fall for that. 34 min: Busquets flicks on Messi\u2019s freekick at the near post. Lenglet tries to head in but, under pressure from Denayer, manages only to nod over the bar. 33 min: Suarez performs a one-two in the box with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 but then is forced back out of the area by Dubois ... who then shoves him and gets a booking. Freekick to Bar\u00e7a wide on the left. 30 min: Lovely play by the hosts. Ndombele again heavily involved before Depay slips a nice pass through to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who open fire from the edge of the box. but Piqu\u00e9 slides in to make a critical block. 28 min: Lyon\u2019s good spell continues. They\u2019re penning Bar\u00e7a back with some very adroit passing ... until Depay overhits and attempted throughball to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. 27 min: Depay\u2019s freekick is headed clear by Piqu\u00e9. 26 min: A good move by Lyon - orchestrated by Ndombele - relieves the pressure, allowing the hosts to spend a bit of time in the opposing half. Mendy joins in the attack and races past Sergi Roberto before the being chopped down. Freekick to Lyon wide on the left. 24 min: Messi fizzes in a corner. Mendy heads it away at the near post. 23 min: Bar\u00e7a are setting up camp in the Lyon half. 21 min: Bar\u00e7a tear forward again. They\u2019re ripping into Lyon every time they get the ball now and it\u2019s starting to look ominous for the French side. But they\u2019ve been spared so far by Bar\u00e7a\u2019s uncharacteristically shoddy finishing. Dembele has jsut given another example, ballooning the ball into the stands when Suarez was appealing for a pass in front of goal. 19 min: O Dembele turns Dubois inside out down the left. Lopes prevents him from topping off the run with a goal, making a good one-on-one save from the left. 17 min: After a lovely buildup, Alba pulls a pass back from the left for Messi, who has a clear shot from 14 yards. But he lifts his shot way over the bar. A lapse in basic technique by the Messi, who can\u2019t quite believe it! 15 min: Sergi Roberto tees up Rakitic at the edge of the box. The Croat aims a gentle curler towards the far corner ... but it drifts fractionally wide. 14 min: After a nice passing sequence by Lyon, Depay over-indulges and gets dispossessed near half-way by Messi, who immediately skedaddles forward to try to inflict maximum punishment. Lyon\u2019s defence scrambles sufficiently to block his shot from 20 yards. 12 min: M. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 fouls O. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Messi curls in the freekick from the left. Marcelo\u2019s header doesn\u2019t quite clear. O. Dembele picks it up on the edge of the box but skies the shot. 9 min: Terrier comes in from the left and collects a lay-back by Dembele before unleashing an absolutely ferocious shot from 25 yards! And Ter Stegen makes a wonderful one-handed save! Reaching it was a feat, but having the hand-strength to push the shot on t o the crossbar was even more impressive. And then he got up and snaffled the rebound before Dembele could get to it. 8 min: It\u2019s been a good open start, with Barcelona looking particularly dynamic. It looks like they\u2019re trying to subjugate their hosts early doors. Which isn\u2019t to say that Lyon have been dominated. 6 min: Point of order: I should have mentioned beforehand that Var is in use today, and will be in all matches fo the remainder of the competition. I was reminded of that by the ref, who has just reminded the players by making a TV motion to warn them they won\u2019t get away with any pulling or shoving when corner kicks are being delivered. 5 min: That\u2019s better from Aouar! His curling low shot from the edge of the area forces Ter Stegen to push it behind for a corner. 5 min: Messi clips the freekick over the wall ... and a couple of yards over the bar. The home crowd exhale. 4 min: Bar\u00e7a\u2019s press pays off: Sergi Roberto robs Aouar in midfield and then feeds Messi, who skitters towards the box. Aouar chases back but brings down the Argentinian from behind. Freekick just inside the D, perfectly central... 3 min: Lyon are trying to press Barcelona to disrupt their building from the back by Bar\u00e7a are good enough to play out so far. 1 min: Lyon-Barcelona is go! The visitors kick off ... and fire off a shot after 24 seconds! Dembele outpaced the home defence to chase down a pass over the top by Piqu\u00e9 and then let fly from the left-hand corner of the box. But he smashed the bouncing ball several yards wide of the far post. Whatever Mendy\u2019s injury is, it hasn\u2019t prevented him from starting: let\u2019s hope he\u2019s fit enough to play the whole match. The teams march out to a tremendous din and lots of coordinated flag-waving. Ouch! This could be a big blow for Lyon and those of us who were looking forward to seeing Mendy in action against Messi: the left-back has been injured in the warm-up and could be replaced by Mar\u00e7al. The atmosphere in the OL Stadium sounds pleasingly rambunctious. The surprise is Lyon\u2019s lineup is Martin Terrier, who\u2019ll play on the left wing instead of Maxwell Cornet. That\u2019s a bit of a turn-up because Cornet has been particularly good in big games this season but 21-year-old Terrier has impressed in recent outings (with Rafa Benitez among those impressed, as he had design on bringing him to Newcastle). \u201cDenayer has been phenomenal for Lyon and the outstanding moment just has to be his flying header goalline clearance against PSG a couple of weeks ago,\u201d says Kari Tulinius, fluffing his pompoms to full effect.. \u201cEvery Lyon game I\u2019ve watched this season has been phenomenal, hope this one is too. Enjoy!\u201d I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve mainly seen their big games? Because, as mentioned, they have a pleasing habit of turning it on in those. It\u2019s a sad that F\u00e9kir\u2019s missing but we can still hope for top showing from Depay, Aouar, Mendy and Ndombele and Dembele: Lyon sure have enough talent to trouble Bar\u00e7a who, by the same token, have the ability to kill the tie today. The last time Lyon hosted Barcelona, in 2009, they scored (in a 1-1 draw) thanks to this masterpiece by the one true king of freekicks, Juninho Pernambucano. Go to 00:51 in this video and marvel at the utter discombobulation of Victor Vald\u00e9s. There are goalkeepers who must still wake in a cold sweat thinking of what Juninho did to them (for more on him, read this if you fancy). Good news for Lyon as Jason Denayer has overcome thigh bother and is fit enough to take his place in central defence, where he has been in top form recently. Lyon: Lopes; Dubois, Marcelo, Denayer, Mendy; Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, Aouar; Terrier, Depay, Traor\u00e9; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Subs: Gorgelin, Mar\u00e7al, Tete, Cheikh, Solet, Cornet, Tousart Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba; Sergi Roberto, Busquets, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Subs: Pena, Coutinho, Malcom, Murillo, Vidal, Umtiti, Alena Referee: C Cakir (Tur) Hello and welcome to the only last 16 tie between two teams who were unbeaten in the group stages. Barcelona, you will remember, swept to the top of a group that included Spurs, Inter and PSV, while Lyon finished second below Manchester City despite winning away to Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. Oddly, all of Lyon\u2019s home matches in the group stage ended 2-2: Barcelona would probably take that today, since it would leave them as heavy favourites to finish the job at the Camp Nou. On the other hand, there is a clear opportunity for them to take an even bigger advantage from this first leg because suspension deprives Lyon of their snazzy playmaker, Nabil F\u00e9kir. But Lyon do still have some fine players as well as a habit of producing their best against the most formidable opponents. And this Bar\u00e7a side are vulnerable. Indeed, Bar\u00e7a have not won any of their last five away knockout matches in this competition and in their last one \u2013 against Roma last season \u2013 they were blown away. So there should be opportunities for both teams today and we can expect them to go at each other with gusto. We can look forward, in particular, to the duel between Lionel Messi and Ferland Mendy, the 23-year-old left-back whom Bar\u00e7a are known to admire. All in all, we\u2019ve got ourselves a potential humdinger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
