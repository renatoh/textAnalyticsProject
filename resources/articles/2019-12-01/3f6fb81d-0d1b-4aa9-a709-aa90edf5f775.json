The Senate foreign relations committee on Wednesday voted unanimously for the bipartisan bill which will now await a slot to go to the Senate. Senator Tim Kaine, the draft legislation\u2019s lead Democratic sponsor, said it was a response to fears that the Trump administration is actively considering withdrawal. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that it has been seriously debated and seriously considered in the White House at the highest levels,\u201d Kaine told the Guardian. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton, reportedly warned last month that, if re-elected in 2020, Trump could go \u201cfull isolationist\u201d and withdraw from the 70-year-old North Atlantic alliance. Kaine predicted his bill to block a Nato withdrawal would gain overwhelming support from the House of Representatives and win a veto-proof majority in the upper chamber of at least 67 votes. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Trump] would veto this bill if it came to his desk because of the signal that it would send would be such an unfortunate one,\u201d Kaine told the Guardian. \u201cIt would be seen as so destabilizing by our allies that I don\u2019t think he would do it. And furthermore, I don\u2019t think the president would veto a bill if he thought he\u2019s going to be overridden, and I think he would be overridden on this one.\u201d The bill aims to close a loophole in the US constitution, which requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to ratify a treaty, but is silent on what it takes to exit a treaty. Kaine\u2019s bill requires the president to seek the advice and consent of the Senate to pull the US out of Nato. The president would have to notify Congress of any effort taken towards termination of US membership, and any no congressionally mandated funds could be spent on withdrawal. Congressional legal counsel would be authorized to challenge the White House in the courts over any presidential attempt to withdraw. \u201cIt specifies clearly, that the the law of the land will now be that a president cannot withdraw from Nato absent a congressional vote,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cSo he could announce he was withdrawing, but that would be an illegal action, and we would feel completely confident that a court would uphold us.\u201d Trump has raised doubt over whether he would order the US to fight if certain Nato allies were attacked, as required by article 5 of the alliance\u2019s founding document. The president has suggested that collective defence should be made conditional on member states meeting the alliance goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence. At a leaders\u2019 meeting to mark the 70th anniversary of Nato in the UK earlier this month, Trump defended Nato against criticism from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, but did little to allay fears that he did not fear bound by Nato\u2019s collective defence obligations. \u201cWe may not change Donald Trump\u2019s minds about these things. But I think what our allies are looking for is some assurance that the American public still finds value in the alliance,\u201d Senator Kaine said. \u201cAnd I think a bill like this, in addition to having some practical effect, would start to answer that question positively.\u201d Constanze Stelzenmueller, the Kissinger chair on foreign policy and international relations at the Library of Congress, said the legislation, if passed, might go some way to steadying European nerves ahead of the 2020 US elections. \u201cFor Europeans, it\u2019s reassuring to know that there is support for Nato in Congress,\u201d Stelzenmueller said. \u201cBut there is also a sense in Europe that if, if there is a second Trump term, then all bets are off. Secondly, the more important issue is how Trump is already changing the world in ways that make Nato\u2019s work obsolete or impossible.\u201d She added: \u201cThere is still a strong feeling in Europe that his default attitude to Nato has been a sense that this is a con that attempts to take advantage of America.\u201d Officials from some European Nato members privately voice concerns that, whatever the views of the Congress, a reluctant US commander-in-chief raised doubts over whether the US would come to their defence in a crisis. Kaine acknowledged that it was a novel dilemma. \u201cPresidents have sometimes wanted to go to war and Congress has said no, but if you\u2019ve hardly had a situation where Congress was wanting to go to war and a president said no,\u201d the Virginia senator said. \u201cYou could potentially foresee that here, although frankly, my worry about this president is more that he will blunder us into a war we shouldn\u2019t be in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
