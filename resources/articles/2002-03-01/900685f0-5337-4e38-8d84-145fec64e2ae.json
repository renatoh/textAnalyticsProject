After dropping Steve as captain of the one-day side last month, the Australian selectors, never known for half measures, have now overlooked them both for a series that will act as a trial run for the World Cup in South Africa in a year's time. Although Steve, still captain of the Test side at 36, has voiced his determination to force his way back into limited-overs contention, indications are that the selectors have opted to build a younger, more energetic squad. Mark Waugh has been a fixture in Australia's one-day side for more than a decade, his 244 one-day internationals bringing him 8,500 runs at 39.55, which puts him fourth on the list of all-time one-day run scorers. His form has been patchy, with no half-centuries in his past 11 innings, a sequence that began in the NatWest triangular series in England last year, but that lean run was preceded by two large hundreds against India and West Indies. Australia have included two 20-year-olds in the Queensland off-spinner Nathan Hauritz and the Tasmania pace bowler Shane Watson. Both Waughs will be looking to make South Africa pay - again - when the second Test starts on Friday in Cape Town. The desperate home side have recalled the unorthodox left-armer Paul Adams and the veteran batsman Daryll Cullinan, and the captain Shaun Pollock is back after missing the first Test humiliation with a side strain. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
