City sources say Tchenguiz, who lost out in a bidding war for London department store Selfridges, has lodged an offer with US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which has been hired by German bank WestLB to sell Pubmaster . WestLB is selling its interests in a number of British businesses that were lent money by its London-based principal finance unit, headed by controversial financier Robin Saunders. Writedowns relating to television rentals firm Box Clever, bankrolled by Saunders' unit, helped push the parent into the red last year. Saunders would like to take over all her UK investments, but there is a major stumbling block: Tchenguiz has pre-emption rights in the event of a sale of Pubmaster and other companies where he has co-invested with Saunders, including whisky company Kyndal and Odeon Cinemas. It is understood that Tchenguiz is keen to tidy up the ownership of Pubmaster as quickly as possible, not least because it is involved in a bidding war for Scottish &amp; Newcastle's pub estate, worth \u00a32.3 billion. The firm has teamed up with private equity outfit BC Partners for the bid. The Iraqi owns 37 per cent of Pubmaster, while WestLB controls 21 per cent. If he bought the German group's holding he would have nearly 60 per cent. Pubmaster's equity is worth around \u00a3200 million, but there is debt of \u00a31bn. Some of the loans are underwritten by West LB. Tchenguiz is a colourful character, renowned for his playboy lifestyle. According to speculation it was he who introduced Princess Diana to Dodi Fayed. He recently teamed up with former Morgan Grenfell banker Scott Lamphere to set up a private equity firm, Aletheia Partners, to search for new businesses. Lamphere was managing director at Morgan Grenfell Private Equity until 2001. He left after a dispute over the disposal of its Formula One investment. \u00b7 WestLB is fighting to restrain Saunders' London team from leaving the bank, it emerged this weekend. Several senior members have been approached by banks and private equity houses looking for staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
