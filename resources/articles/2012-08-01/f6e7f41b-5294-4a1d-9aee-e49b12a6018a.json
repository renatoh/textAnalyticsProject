But whereas the result of the women's semi-final on Wednesday night was heartbreak, this was pure humiliation. In front of a 16,000 crowd and countless more in their living rooms Britain suffered their worst defeat in Olympic history, a 9-2 drubbing from the Netherlands that showcased their opponents' flair and finesse while shattering the home side's game plan to pieces. The men's team will now contest the bronze-medal match against Australia, who lost to Germany in the earlier semi-final 4-2. But how they will recover themselves from the manner of this defeat is a question only a highly qualified psychotherapist can answer. \"We're all very embarrassed with the result and mostly the performance,\" said Jason Lee, the Great Britain coach. \"Holland made the pitch very big for us.\" Very, very big. Kalahari desert big. The Netherlands ran in four goals in the first half, ending it with a 4-1 lead. Then in the second they played against wraiths, Britain's men a barely corporeal presence between the Dutch and their target practice. \"We probably got reckless far too early,\" admitted Lee, who believed that Britain's attempts to get back into the game were to blame. \"It had a lot of risk associated with it. We could have just shut it down and kept it at 3- or 4-1 and it would have been a less embarrassing result.\" Britain were always the underdogs against the form side of the tournament, with a 100% win record. Britain, by comparison, had drawn three of their pool games \u2013 two of them by the skin of their teeth. This was the Netherlands' sixth consecutive Olympic semi-final; Britain have not been in medal contention since 1988. They were behind from the ninth minute, when the Dutch completed a penalty corner with a perfect dragflick into the top right-hand corner by Roderick Weusthof. All the talk in the build-up had been of their young forward Mink van der Weerden but it was Weusthof who looked deadly throughout and who converted a mishandled penalty corner into Holland's second goal. Befuddled by the Dutch tactics, the British defence struggled to stem the flow of orange shirts down the middle of the pitch. They remained in the hunt thanks to 19-year-old Harry Martin, who won them their only penalty corner of the half, fired in by Ashley Jackson. But two more Dutch goals followed, one a set piece and one a brilliant counterattack, finished by Billy Bakker. Aside from their goal, Britain had only troubled the Dutch keeper once. Still, they had made up a three-goal deficit against Australia, the world No1 team, only last Sunday. For a brief moment at the start of the second half, it looked as if they would rejoin the fight, winning two penalty corners within the first few minutes. But Jackson's shots were blocked and it was the last attempt on goal Britain would have for half an hour. Apr\u00e8s \u00e7a le d\u00e9luge. Holland were playing with panache and skill but also with a pace and ruthlessness that belied their already hefty advantage. In a seven-minute period they scored four goals, including two from Bakker, the first of two Dutch players to complete a hat-trick. One of his efforts seemed to defy the laws of physics, a reverse stick shot that sent the ball into the net from such an angle that mirror work must have been involved. Many of Britain's games at this tournament have required - and rewarded - strong encouragement from the boisterous home crowd. But here the Dutch fans, a tangerine filling running through the Riverbank, were more visible than their rivals, and by the second half they were more audible too as Britain were dismantled both tactically and mentally. Their previous worst defeat to Holland had been a mere 5-0; at 9-1 GB were on course to surpass their worst ever defeat, 8-1 to Pakistan in 2000. Instead they merely equalled it. Two penalty corners and a consolation goal by Rob Moore within the last 10 minutes could not salvage pride but did at least go on a deep-water dive for it. The Dutch had long been wearing the smiles of those who are merely playing for fun. The crowd roared as James Fair saved the Netherlands' final penalty corner. It was all there was left to cheer. Afterwards the players left the pitch with the look of men who have seen too much. Barry Middleton was asked what he could say about Britain's performance: \"Probably sorry, to start with. That wasn't really us. It's hard to say why it's happened. They generally passed, tackled, shot and ran better than us. You don't have many games where a team does every aspect better than you.\" What was he thinking as the maelstrom unfurled? \"There wasn't too much time to think,\" admitted the GB captain, \"because we were chasing them again.\" Fair, meanwhile, was candid about what was going through his mind: \"Not to let in 10.\" And yet a place in the bronze-medal play-off remains, almost perversely, Britain's best placing in the tournament in 24 years. While talk of Seoul 1988 has come to a screeching halt, the issue facing this team now will be to contend for a medal at all: Lee admitted his side had lost the \"basics\" of their game in the second half, \"and that will be the most challenging thing to regain in a day and a half\". If this game has taught us anything, however, it is that 70 minutes can be a very long time indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
