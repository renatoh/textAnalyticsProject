The government boasts of its ability to connect the nation with bigger and better connections and parliament seemed a good place to start. But, as our supersleuth friend David Hencke discovers, the grand plan went wrong. The idea was that MPs should have faster IT. But in a private email, inevitably leaked, officials admit that contractors have given them the opposite. \"The problems may have shown themselves in freezing or slowing down of your web browsing, video via the web, slower delivery of emails sent outside parliament,\" officials say. And why? \"In January, one of our suppliers involved in this upgrade inadvertently introduced an error into the supporting software. This had the opposite effect of that intended, that is, it reduced the capacity of access to the internet.\" Parliament says the problem is now fixed and the contractors have paid a price, but MPs mutter that things are as bad as ever. Same old, same old. The next grand IT scheme unveiled without calamity will probably be the first. \u2022 Tribal fisticuffs as MPs contest leadership of the parliamentary group on Russia. Labour's Chris Bryant \u2013 who was chair, then wasn't \u2013 would like to be again. Tory MP Harriett Baldwin, who usurped him, stood down because she is a whip. The new rival is Tory MP John Randall, and Bryant is keen to win \"especially at a time when a clear message on Ukraine is essential\". But despite those IT problems, he sent his pitch by email. Will any supporters see it? \u2022 Former London mayor Ken Livingstone was effusive in praise today for the fearless, now departed, union strongman Bob Crow. But last week, the Labour bigwig was closer to the acidic norm as he joined energy secretary Ed Davey in London's Docklands for the 2014 Ecobuild conference. Livingstone spoke on making cities more resilient in future following the winter floods, not least those areas affected in the banker belt in Berkshire along the Thames. Livingstone noted that most politicians wouldn't have a clue about some of the hi-tech energy-saving gadgets on display, nor the computer assessment of climate change, because so few can claim scientific training. Livingstone, however, is different, having spent eight years at the outset of his working life as an assistant in a scientific laboratory. This, he said, had left him with knowledge that would prove useful and high hopes in particular for the future of genetic engineering. For years he hoped for a gene that might give his fellow politicians a spine. \u2022 And what of Bob Crow? What would he have made of all the tributes. What would he have made of those kind words from Boris Johnson, the capital's mayor, who throughout the best part of two terms refused to have any formal working meetings with him? The mayor will hope for more tranquil industrial relations in the post-Crow era, but that's some hope, because the fact is that his bete noir was regarded by those in the know as a moderate man leading and sometimes frustrating a hard left executive. Henceforth Johnson may find an RMT much harder to deal with; untroubled by the slightest desire to meet with him. \u2022 Finally, that item about the north London Conservatives who boast of \"keeping in touch with the 'hood'\" prompts many to wonder why Tories bother with their divisive Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, when something new and possibly cheaper lies closer to hand. They see much more promise in this \"keeping it real\" style of Conservatism than all that Ukip-lite guff about migration. Gangsta rap was ever right of centre; listen to Thatcher and then 50 Cent. And the prize for building this new approach into something the party can use goes to Justin Hinchcliffe, the irrepressible leader of the Tottenham Tories and long a source of radical new ideas. A tireless organiser now, but aged 14 he was the most famous Young Conservative in the country. Master Hinchcliffe damned his local hospital for being \"full of geriatrics who waste the taxpayers' money\". He urged the poor to eat fish from the Thames."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
