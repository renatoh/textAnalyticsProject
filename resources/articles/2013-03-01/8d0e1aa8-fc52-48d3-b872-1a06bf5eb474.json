Even if it is Francis Maude", "bodyText": "\u2022 From day one, Cabinet Office civil servants were surprised at the intense interest of their minister Francis Maude in public relations and the amount government spent on communications. Radical ideas streamed forth. He insisted on dramatic cuts, froze all marketing activity and proposed amalgamating all government press offices into a single body. That idea persisted until Maude's cabinet colleagues realised who would control writing the press releases. But Maude did kill off the central office of information. As eyes turn towards the next election, however, PR spending is back in favour, with Maude recently approving a new \u00a3300m government advertising contract. One of the firms on the inside track to handle the account is Bray Leino. A medium-sized, West Country-based outfit, the agency at first looks like an answer to the government's wish to ginger up a market dominated by the likes of BBDO and M&amp;C Saatchi by getting smaller fry involved. Bray Leino, however, is part of a bigger company, Mission Group. And now there's a fuss because, until February 2010, Maude was a non-executive board chair at Mission. With advertising and PR contracts now administered by the Government Procurement Service \u2013 which as part of the Cabinet Office rests in the kingdom of Francis Maude \u2013 he has levers he always wanted. He's happy. We're happy for him. At last, a general who seems lucky. \u2022 After a weekend of brickbats for the prime minister, meanwhile, and the inglorious sight of would-be replacements like Liam Fox and Theresa May jockeying for position, interesting to read an insider's evaluation of the various contenders. One well-placed rightwinger outlined the situation, as they saw it, to Iain Dale, the Conservative rune reader and host of the drivetime programme on LBC 97.3. \"Davis too lazy, Gove too odd/Scottish, Hague too bald/unsound\u2026 Fox finished, Villiers useless, Greening unstable, Hammond charisma-bypass, Hunt goggle-eyed, Boris is Fabricant without the common sense and as reliable as a Reliant Robin, May risible.\" As for Osborne, a very rude description; rhymes with Hunt. That's the strength in depth? Explains why the PM isn't rattled yet. \u2022 And yet he does have a problem, and it is that even now so few know what he stands for. The left say the PM is too rightwing. But in Brussels the view of the bureaucracy is different again. He has just been derided as a great big lefty. It occurred last week at a meeting between energy experts and G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the EU commissioner for energy. He was asked to comment on the process by which Dave's people seek to allay the investment fears of French state-owed nuclear giant EDF by guaranteeing the future unit costs of electricity. What do you think of that, the commissioner was asked? Positively \"Soviet\", he said. It was \"a jokey reference\", the commissioner explained after his comment, apparently made under Chatham House rules, leaked to Twitter. Will Dave be amused? Nyet. \u2022 Just a few days into the job and the new archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has taken to reputation management. He didn't mind when twitmericks, the limerick master of the twitterati, penned the following last winter. \"There is an old bishop named Justin/ The C of E places its trust in/ As bish on the Wear/ For only a year/ By episcopal standards he's thrustin.\" But last week's posting by twitmericks (\"There was a boy singer named Justin/Who got all aggressive &amp; thrustin/Unwantedly papped/He suddenly snapped/In language profane &amp; disgustin'\") left the head of the archbish a little worried. \"Just for the record that is another justin,\" he tweeted, by way of clarification. Would potty-mouthed Justin Bieber want to be mistaken for him? \u2022 Finally, it was a landmark event in the mud-splattered history of British music festivals. Among the attractions of the Hop Farm event in Kent last year was the first festival appearance by his entertainment eminence Sir Bruce Forsyth. He turned up with a 17-piece orchestra and, as one would expect, was a hit. But the promoter behind the event went into liquidation. And now, sources confirm, Sir Bruce is \u00a39,000 out of pocket. His first may be his last. The show must go on, but not at a whopping loss. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
