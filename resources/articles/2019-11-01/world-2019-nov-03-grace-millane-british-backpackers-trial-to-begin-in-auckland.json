The 27-year-old New Zealand man re-entered his not-guilty plea in proceedings on Monday. He was granted name suppression by the high court in Auckland in December. The five-week trial will resume on Wednesday, with a 12-person jury comprising seven women and five men, RNZ reported. Justice Simon Moore noted the case was the subject of intense public and media interest, and warned jurors to leave emotion at the door. Moore also noted that politicians \u2013 including the prime minister \u2013 had \u201cwaded into the debate\u201d of Millane\u2019s death in New Zealand during her overseas experience. \u201cHer disappearance, followed by confirmation of her death, excited intense media attention and public comment both here and overseas. Vigils in her memory were held across the country and there were marches and other public events.\u201d Justice Moore said. \u201cNo one in this country, unless they were out of all communication with the modern world, could not have been aware of these events. The story took the nation by storm and that interest continues today, which is plainly evident from the banks of media present here.\u201d \u201cEvery juror has a duty to put feelings of sympathy and prejudice to one side and approach their task coolly and dispassionately.\u201d Forty crown witnesses will give evidence in Auckland high court, RNZ reported, including Millane\u2019s father, David. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December and her body was found in bushland in west Auckland a week later. The death shocked New Zealand and prompted an outpouring of public grief. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, made an emotional public statement, saying Millane should have been safe visiting Aotearoa. \u201cThere is this overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country, a place that prides itself on our hospitality, on our manaakitanga,\u201d Ardern said, using the M\u0101ori word for hospitality. \u201cSo on behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace\u2019s family \u2013 your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d Unusually tight restrictions have been placed on local and international media reporting the case, after the accused\u2019s name and photograph was published last year by several British newspapers, potentially jeopardising the crown\u2019s case against him. Members of the public also shared his name and photographs widely on social media platforms and blogs. Mass candlelight vigils were held for Millane, who came from Essex, in every major town in New Zealand, and grief experts said many New Zealanders experienced \u201cvicarious trauma\u201d about the murder in the usually safe country, averaging fewer than 50 homicides a year in a population of 4.9 million. Millane was travelling in New Zealand as part of a year-long overseas experience and was last seen alive on CCTV footage entering a hotel in central Auckland on the night she disappeared. After her death Grace\u2019s father, David Millane, spoke at a candlelit vigil held in her honour. \u201cGrace was not born here and only managed to stay a few weeks, but you have taken her to your hearts and in some small way she will forever be a Kiwi,\u201d Millane said. \u201cWe all hope that what has happened to Grace will not deter even one person from venturing out into the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
