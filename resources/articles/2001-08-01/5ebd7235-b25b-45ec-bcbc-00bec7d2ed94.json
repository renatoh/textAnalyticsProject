And that\u00cds just the TV festival. Unfortunately, a tragic personal bereavement meant that the single most-trumpeted fixture of the festival weekend didn\u00cdt take place. That was the appearance of the new culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, who was expected to give her verdict on the BBC\u00cds proposed new digital services. As the whole world must know by now, we want to offer the growing number of digital TV households an ambitious new portfolio of channels. In addition to our core services, BBC1 and 2, the increasingly confident News 24 and BBC Parliament, we want to provide licence-payers with four new services: BBC3, a new mixed-genre channel aimed at younger viewers, rooted in a commitment to original new British talent; BBC4, a channel of culture and ideas and a new and unique space for truly ambitious, challenging programming in the digital spectrum; and two children\u00cds channels based on the special confidence that children and parents place in the BBC across every children\u00cds genre. This TV line-up was mirrored by a formidable set of proposals for new BBC digital radio stations. Greg Dyke announced our proposed line-up at last year\u00cds Edinburgh festival. And he made the point that the new channels and stations would mark the limit of the BBC\u00cds digital ambitions in linear radio and television. On TV, in fact, the four new services would replace three existing services (BBC Choice, BBC Knowledge and the existing daytime block of children\u00cds programmes on Choice), so the net proposed expansion was relatively modest anyway. Soon after Edinburgh, we asked the British public what they thought, both in a formal consultation process and also in an independently-conducted opinion-poll. In both cases, support for the new services was very strong. Although we weren\u00cdt surprised that the public were in favour - both TV and radio portfolios, after all, had been devised on the basis of extensive audience research - the response in both consultation and poll was emphatic. Finally, as we were bound to do, we wrote to the government in January this year to ask for their consent for the launch of the new services. The government has been taking its own soundings and mulling over the decision since then. We believe our new channels will offer a richer, better service to the growing numbers of licence-payers who can receive them. We also think they could make a real difference to digital take-up, which is in everyone\u00cds interests. So the long wait has been a frustrating one. On the other hand, we recognise that our plans have to be weighed up in the context of the whole broadcast market and that the decision is therefore a genuinely complex one. The new secretary of state has immersed herself in the issue almost from the day she took office and we\u00cdre hopeful she will be able to announce a decision in the next few weeks. Everything I\u00cdve described so far is right and proper. Our plans should be discussed and debated with the public. The government has to take a view on them and on their likely impact. But there\u00cds been another side to the whole saga. Long before Greg\u00cds MacTaggart, in fact, ever since I first began to describe our new channel strategy at Banff last June, there\u00cds been a fierce debate in the industry and in the media about our digital plans. BBC1, you may remember being warned by some anxious voices, was going to become an entertainment-only channel. In fact, news and current affairs will be the single most important genre on the new BBC1. There\u00cds more regional news on the channel than ever before and I hope we can transfer our regional current affairs from BBC2 to 1 as well. Documentaries and other factual programmes will continue to play a major role on the channel: our spend on BBC1 on specialist factual areas like history and science is going up by 20% and will be larger than it\u00cds ever been before. Another set of critics had a slightly different fear. According to them, we were going to take all the high quality programmes away from BBC1 and 2 altogether and dump them in new digital \u00efdustbins\u00cd. In fact, we\u00cdve given a guarantee to the public that the spend and hours we devote to key genres like the arts, religion and current affairs on the terrestrial channels will at least remain steady and in some cases will increase. If, as we hope, we commission, say, arts programmes for BBC4 and BBC3, they will be in addition to, rather than instead of, what we already offer viewers of our terrestrial networks. Both these arguments were really smokescreens for another, rather more obvious and self-interested argument from the commercial lobby: wouldn\u00cdt the BBC\u00cds new networks steal eyeballs - and therefore revenue - from existing commercial channels? The market already provided children\u00cds channels, entertainment channels, even a couple of subscription arts channels: how then could the BBC argue that it was providing something new and distinctive? To answer these questions, you only have to look at what we\u00cdre actually proposing. Of course the market provides children\u00cds channels, but not children\u00cds channels which are based on British talent and new British production, which bring news and documentary and educational programming to children as well as entertainment and which are free of the advertisements which we know so many parents dislike. Yes, there are entertainment channels, but not channels like BBC3, which have as much as \u00a3100m to invest each year in the British writers, performers and programme-makers of tomorrow. Use your handset and EPG to browse through the channels currently available on digital and see if you can find a channel committed to hourly news programmes expressly designed for younger viewers or to social action programmes or current affairs for that audience? No, there isn\u00cdt one. And we believe that BBC4 will be unique and distinctive as well. It won\u00cdt be a subscription channel available only to those who are able and willing to pay, but will be available to all. It will work alongside BBC2 and Radios 3 and 4 to bring far more of the BBC\u00cds enormous cultural resources to the screen than we\u00cdve ever been able to do before. We believe it could actually strengthen the prospects of channels like Artsworld by persuading more potential subscribers to sign up for digital. In the past few days, one powerful voice in the industry, Channel 4, has spoken up in favour of the BBC\u00cds plans. That\u00cds because Channel 4 also believes that a really rich offering of public service channels will be good for British television as a whole. The commercial voices still raised in opposition are motivated not by a desire to enrich the viewing experience of the British public but by a determination to exclude any alternative to their own services. We know from talking to viewers across the UK that they want more, not less choice in their viewing. Access to more high-quality channels is essential if digital take-up, which has slowed in recent months, is to pick up again. We know the public want our channels because they\u00cdve told us they do. We hope that government, having weighed all the facts and listened to all the arguments, will reach the same conclusion.
