Maybe now people will stop accusing us of apathy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/nov/11/voterapathy-youngpeople", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/nov/11/voterapathy-youngpeople", "fields": {"headline": "Don't curb our enthusiasm", "bodyText": "I had the misfortune to spend February 15 2003, on the largest protest march in London's history walking alongside a man in his 60s, who insisted on outlining the ways my peers lacked his generation's courage to speak up for their beliefs. In one sense he was right: I didn't have the courage to tell him to shut up. But I do wonder what he, and those like him who have long insisted that young people are apathetic, thought of last week's victory for Obama, and the fact that the president-elect's historic win was in large part thanks to voters under 30. On Tuesday, 54.4% of Americans aged 18-29 voted, the second highest youth turnout, and only one point lower than the record in 1972. In addition to his voters, many grassroots campaigners crucial in ensuring Obama's victory were also in their 20s. Their monetary donations may have made little difference, but young Obama supporters gave their time, in record numbers, to make phone calls on behalf of their candidate, or campaign door-to-door in their home towns and colleges. Added to this, the sheer amount of Obama, McCain and Palin youtube clips, parodies and mash-ups that went viral over the summer is a sign of how glued to the election young people were, so much so that political content became merged with entertainment. For all that has been written about the Obama campaign's use of social networking sites, email and SMS messaging, none of it would have been effective if the message itself wasn't one that struck a chord with young voters desperate to draw a line under the lamentable Bush era. The conclusion from all this should not be that \"youth apathy\" has suddenly been dissipated by the arrival of Obama: it should be a sign it was never a reality in the first place. The disconnect is twofold: first, youth political engagement in the 2000s just didn't look like the interest of the previous generation; and second, the barometer against which we are constantly compared \u2013 the political activism of the 60s \u2013 has been rewritten in public accounts to the point where it is no longer works as an objective historical comparison to the alleged \"youth apathy\" today. Without meaning to disrespect the hard work of a previous generation of progressive campaigners, it is not that the younger generation forgot the message of the 1960s but that we took a different message from the one baby boomers were hoping for: protest marches rarely work. It took nine years to end the Vietnam war, and it took institutional change to ensure progressive measures such as Roe v Wade. When, in 2003, unprecedented worldwide protests weren't enough to stop the Iraq war, it seemed our distrust of naive optimism had been proven right: ordinary people speaking out can't effect any change, no matter how large their number. This despondency has often been mistaken for disinterest. Because we didn't think we could change the world, we've been treated as though we forfeited the right to be taken seriously. The corollary of the myth of youth apathy \u2013 the accusation that young people are \"cynical\" \u2013 seems to be more a misdiagnosis of sarcasm, a trait which easily co-exists with being politically engaged \u2013 see the popularity of The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and snarky political website Wonkette. It sometimes seemed that, at the times when the media could recognise the sound of young political engagement, they didn't like what they heard \u2013 Ludacris's Obama Is Here had some dumb, misogynist lines about Hillary Clinton, but that's what it took for newspaper editors to notice that commercial rappers were talking about politics again. When you start to look for it on its own terms, it's clear political activism among teenagers and twentysomethings never really went away. The pre-9/11 anti-globalisation movement may have been fraught with internal contradictions, with the conservative protectionism of Jose Bove set uneasily alongside the hopes of anarchists and campaigners against IMF debts, but the era doesn't deserve to become a mere footnote to the recent success of Obama's young supporters.The largest protest marches in British history happened in the 2000s, and the groups campaigning against genocide in Darfur are largely comprised of students. The 2005 fashion trend for broad-sweeping statements on plastic wrist bands or the lamentable 2007 fashion trend for Topshop-sold kaffiyehs, may have been vapid, a commercial co-option of political statements, but they were also a bubbling-up in the mainstream of an overwhelming distrust of George Bush, anger about the Iraq war and the broken millennial promises on dropping the debt. It wasn't, in fact, that Obama energised the youth vote, so much as that an already-energised generation finally found an institutional figure who spoke about their concerns. As the initial euphoria for the \"Yes We Can\" message subsides, Obama will realise that sending his young supporters Facebook messages will mean little if he doesn't follow it up with policies that recognise the situations they face. In his Grant Park speech, Obama said that \"this victory alone is not the change we seek \u2013 it is only the chance for us to make that change.\" Maybe now my friends who worked on the Obama campaign this summer will transfer their energy to protesting against violence in Darfur or calling for action in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ... or, maybe they'll go back to watching Gossip Girl for a bit. Either way, after Obama's election, they've earned the right to be taken seriously, which is another thing we haven't seen for a long time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
