Unverified footage on social media appeared to show at least one police officer attempting to restrain Rashan Charles, 20, on the floor of a convenience store on Kingsland Road, east London, on Saturday at 1.45am. Charles was taken to Royal London hospital, where he died a short time later. Approximately 150 people, some with placards bearing the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, gathered outside Stoke Newington police station on Monday evening. The crowd chanted, \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d as each speaker took to the microphone. Maha, a 25-year-old student who attended the protest with a friend, said: \u201cIt seems like if we don\u2019t nip this in the bud and if we don\u2019t get justice, then people will think they can get away with it. Not just the police, it\u2019s a whole racist mentality and if the police can do it then civilians will think they can do it. It\u2019s important we raise as much awareness as possible.\u201d She added: \u201cThe police are supposed to be protecting us but they\u2019re being reckless with our lives.\u201d Another woman, 24, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cI just think it\u2019s sad. We got through the civil rights movement. We\u2019re supposed to be equal. And it\u2019s not just black people. It\u2019s about all the races, anyone of colour, Muslims, anyone who is poor \u2013 they\u2019re being failed.\u201d The vigil was organised by Stand Up To Racism and campaigners said they were \u201cenormously concerned and angered\u201d over his death. Esa Charles, the victim\u2019s father, spoke at the protest. Pauline Pearce, a friend of the Charles family, said in a statement: \u201cThe parents, the family have requested we keep calm. There are many organisations out there that are jumping on the bandwagon, running and organising these police protests at the station. This is nothing to do with the family, it has no authorisation from the family.\u201d In the wake of his death, Charles \u2013 who had a baby daughter \u2013 was described by his friends as \u201cgentle and caring\u201d and with a generous nature. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the death. The Metropolitan police said Charles was seen \u201ctrying to swallow an object\u201d and that an officer \u201csought to prevent the man from harming himself\u201d. The IPCC tweeted late on Monday: \u201cFor those following #justiceforrash #justiceforrashman \u2013 we are making good progress, building a full picture of what happened and why. \u201cWe know people have concerns, but our independent investigation will be thorough, rigorous &amp; when appropriate its findings will be published.\u201d In a statement, Ch Supt Simon Laurence, the borough commander for Hackney, said: \u201cAll police officers understand that they will be asked to account for their actions and they would not want it any other way,\u201d adding: \u201cI understand his death has had an impact on some members of the local community.\u201d He also said he had met community representatives and wanted to continue to hear about community concerns. Charles\u2019s death was the second police-related death in London in a little over a month. Edson Da Costa, 25, died last month after being restrained by police in Beckton, east London and there were protests against alleged police brutality following his death. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 August 2017 because an earlier version said the family of Rashan Charles distanced themselves from the protest. His father, Esa Charles, spoke at the protest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
