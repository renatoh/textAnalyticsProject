First time around it all kicked off with Michael Winner's Death Wish, the surprise hit of 1974, as Tricky Dicky was finally slinking off the political stage into historical infamy. Death Wish - in which Charles Bronson took on street punks by the howling, pocket-picking dozen - had angry yahoos roaring their approval in movie houses across the nation. The other dumbass revenge fantasy that season was Phil Karlson's Walking Tall, in which Joe Don Baker, ever the mad Texas rightie, walloped a whole mess of southern-fried mobster pigs with a great big club. Both it and Death Wish spawned a slew of steadily worsening sequels, and had imitators digging out their most retrograde revenge scenarios. Death Wish author Brian Garfield was so appalled by the Winner treatment, the toxic power of the sequels, and the simian reaction of the more knuckle-dragging portions of the audience that he refused to licence his sequel, Death Sentence, for adaptation. Indeed, he held on for nearly three decades. However, now that he's dead, his heirs have exhibited no such scruples, and Death Sentence is upon us, starring Kevin Bacon as another put-upon street avenger, and directed by Saw's James Wan. Even sensible people like Jodie Foster and Neil Jordan are crowding into similar territory, with the forthcoming The Brave One. The film-makers probably paid heed to the mini-success of Paparazzi a couple of years ago. That film, produced by champion Hollywood rightie Mel Gibson, told of a movie star whose wife and family are threatened by malevolent celeb-photographing thugs. Somehow, they are efficiently dispatched by an allegedly world-famous movie star who bitches that he can't move for stalking paparazzi. Coming only a few years after the flop of Payback (more of the same), Paparazzi's only notable achievement was not drawing more media condemnation for its loathsome politics. Now, wouldn't it be nice if the US government just went ahead and used the Bronsonian, Gibson-derived, Old Testament version of vengeance as the basis for all of its political actions? I swear, the spirit of Michael Winner is now writing American foreign policy. You got attacked by someone? Easy, hit the streets and take out anyone - anyone! - who even faintly resembles the original muggers, no matter if they have a criminal record or not, or even better, if they're the wrong people altogether. Sure, the innocent corpses might start stacking up in the streets soon enough, but the important thing is... you did not back down in the face of evil! You got your licks in! You took a few of the sons of bitches down with you!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
