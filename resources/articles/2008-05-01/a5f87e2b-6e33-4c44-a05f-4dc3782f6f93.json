Listening to him smoothly navigate through the topics, it was easy to understand why he was voted speech broadcaster of the year at last week's Sony Awards. But it's not simply breadth of subject. Mayo's skill is in grasping that he is the host rather than the story itself, and very much his listeners' representative. His style isn't showy or throbbing with ego, and he wears his intelligence lightly. I've always liked the way he bowls only a short, direct question or nudge to his guests (\"Just explain the title,\" he asked the Dalai Lama expert) and then gives them room to speak. This tactic can often harvest more than an aggressive tussle, and is well suited to the relaxed mood of afternoon broadcasting. If any sparks do fly, it is between his guests. Monday's lively discussion of toffs, available as a podcast, is a good example of how Mayo sits back and lets others do the sniping in response to his gentle, seemingly innocent queries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
