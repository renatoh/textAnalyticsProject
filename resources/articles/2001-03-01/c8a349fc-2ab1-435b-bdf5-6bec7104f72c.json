While the fox hunting Bill may appear to be good populist politics, it is disastrous policy. Based on numerous misconceptions, the Bill has generated myopic passions to the point that it has become very difficult to think about the issue rationally. What is plain, however, is that the Bill is primarily about limiting people's behaviour rather than animal welfare. Even the most ardent anti-hunt campaigner cannot deny that foxes must be controlled and that the 70,000 odd foxes destroyed each year in Britain - 15,000 are killed by hunting with packs of hounds - will have to be dealt with in one way or another. The alternative methods are likely to cause just as much suffering, probably more. The antis object not to the principle of control but to the enjoyment taken from pursuing foxes on horseback. They say it is self-evident that hunting people, many of them admittedly preposterous and old fashioned, take a barbaric pleasure from the cruelty inflicted on the fox. And so they claim a moral imperative to curtail this pleasure. But there is a fine distinction which separates hunting from bear and badger baiting: hunting people do not take pleasure from the death of a fox. Indeed, very few witness it. Their object is to pursue and kill the fox, not to watch its death. To ban fox hunting on the basis of this misunderstanding would be illiberal in the extreme and would do much to reduce the reputation of the law in a law-abiding community. This is to say nothing of the loss of jobs in the countryside - estimated to be between 6,000 and 8,000 - the inevitable destruction of a large proportion of the 25,000 hounds in Britain and the gradual reduction in the number of horses. Ironically, all this is being promoted in the name of animal welfare. At this very late stage a welcome compromise has been promoted in a Private Member's Bill by Lord Donoughue, which proposes regulation by a body that would ensure against what the Burns Report called 'a serious compromise to animal welfare'. Given that polls show a decline in support for a total ban - from 70 to 50 per cent - this must be the right way forward, and Lord Burns supports his fellow peer's move. The passions that swirl around fox hunting are out of all proportion to its importance as an issue. Perhaps they should now be steered towards the much greater challenge of protecting the environment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
