International aid organisations, human rights groups and doctors have sounded the alarm. With the spread of the pandemic, calls for action to prevent impending medical catastrophe have become shriller. In Aegean islands on the frontline of the crisis, health carers speak of days gained, not won. But an outbreak of the disease in two facilities near Athens has intensified concerns over the estimated 36,000 men, women and children stranded on remote isles opposite the Turkish coast. Installations on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos \u2013 at six times over capacity, sprawling, wretched and congested \u2013 where social distancing, and other precautionary measures are an impossible privilege, offer fertile ground for Covid-19. \u201cTime is on nobody\u2019s side,\u201d said Dutch physician Steven van de Vijver, the driving force behind an online petition urging EU leaders to bring refugees to safety by agreeing to take them in from Greece. Since its launch last week, more than 6,000 European doctors have signed the appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to require superhuman force and a lot of luck now to stop this potentially lethal virus penetrating island camps,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I would say it\u2019s almost impossible that it won\u2019t happen.\u201d After two weeks working in Moria, the squalid and notoriously overpopulated holding facility on Lesbos, De Vijver realised it was an illusion to think that, in such conditions, Covid-19 could be kept under control. \u201cIt would be a miracle and it\u2019s dangerous to expect miracles to happen. Coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect borders or barbed wire. People, camp workers, go in and out all the time, and with them the risk of the virus,\u201d he said. Greek authorities recognise that they are in a race against the clock. Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona \u2013 among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland \u2013 has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday. Speaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry\u2019s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers\u2019 reception, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We\u2019ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It\u2019s not been easy, there\u2019ve been protests. \u201cFood has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.\u201d The outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital. \u201cAll the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,\u201d said Logothetis, a doctor himself. \u201cI found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona\u2019s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they\u2019ll be able to ride this out.\u201d However, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece. Increasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. Calls for the evacuation of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population. Holding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis. \u201cIt is not a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 coronavirus strikes the camps,\u201d said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. \u201cI do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.\u201d Although so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. \u201cIn the hospital for example. That\u2019s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.\u201d Most asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed. Almost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors\u2019 petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled. Greece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76. But health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical. \u201cThe EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,\u201d warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city\u2019s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus. \u201cThere are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,\u201d he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month. \u201cI was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,\u201d he said. Greece\u2019s centre-right government has described the camps as \u201cticking health bombs\u201d. So far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland \u2013 including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres \u2013 according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people \u2013 300 elderly refugees and their dependents \u2013 to hotels in Athens. Reflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps. But Logothetis accepts that in the event of a \u201cmass coronavirus outbreak\u201d, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. \u201cIn an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don\u2019t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.\u201d The pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a EU-funded scheme announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens\u2019 suspension of applications in response to Turkey\u2019s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests. Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled. Officials say member states now want additional health checks, \u201cwhich will take time\u201d. With the spectre of gridlock, Athens has come under increased pressure from the EU to relocate asylum seekers to the mainland. But that, says Greece\u2019s migration minister Notis Mitarachi, is practically impossible without adequate accommodation. Addressing the EU parliament\u2019s home affairs committee as police moved to lock down Ritsona, he reiterated what prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said repeatedly: Europe should do more to help because Greece \u201ccannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone\u201d. It is a refrain echoed by Logothetis. \u201cWe need support and we need to share the burden,\u201d he said. \u201cIf each of the other 26 EU member states agreed to take in 2,000 people, our problem would be more than settled. I\u2019d be able to empty the islands in a day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
