Moore is defying his party with his return to the political stage, and faces a crowded Republican primary field as he aims for an eventual rematch against the Democratic senator Doug Jones, who won against him in the 2017 special election to fill the seat previously held by former US attorney general Jeff Sessions. \u201cI believe in America. I believe we\u2019ve got to have politicians that go to Washington and do what they say,\u201d Moore said during his announcement on Thursday. Some state and national Republicans, worried that Moore is too polarizing and could jeopardize what should otherwise be a reliable Republican seat, have discouraged him from entering the race. Republicans see retaking the Alabama seat as a top priority in 2020. \u201cAlabama can do better than Roy Moore,\u201d the state\u2019s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, told reporters shortly before Moore\u2019s announcement. He declined to say what he would do to try blocking Moore but said he believed \u201ca lot\u201d of Republican groups would oppose him. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, concurred in a brief interview with the Associated Press before the announcement. \u201cHe can do what he wants to, but we\u2019re certainly going to oppose him in every way,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. Donald Trump tweeted last month that Moore \u201ccannot win\u201d and said Republicans need to retake the seat in the once reliably red state. \u201cRepublicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,\u201d Trump wrote. Moore brushed aside that criticism on Thursday, saying the people of Alabama are angry and want Washington to stay out of their elections \u201cCan I win? Yes I can win,\u201d he said. The Democratic senatorial campaigncommittee spokesman, Stewart Boss, said national Republicans who supported Moore\u2019s 2017 campaign \u201chave nobody to blame but themselves for the chaotic primary that\u2019s escalating in Alabama\u201d. Jones said in a statement that Moore\u2019s candidacy \u201cwill make a divisive Republican primary even more extreme\u201d. During the 2017 race, six women accused Moore of pursuing romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers as young as 14 and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Two accused him of assault or molestation. Moore denied the accusations and has said he considered his 2017 defeat, when he lost to Jones by 22,000 votes out of 1.3m cast, \u201ca fraud\u201d. Moore retains a strong following among some evangelical voters in the state. He was twice elected as the state\u2019s chief justice but was twice stripped of those duties after a judicial ethics panel said he defied, or urged defiance of, federal court orders regarding same-sex marriage and the public display of the Ten Commandments. A crowded Republican primary field is competing to challenge Jones. Representative Bradley Byrne, the former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville and legislator Arnold Mooney have already announced bids."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
