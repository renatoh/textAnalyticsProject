Staff were told today of the target date and a timetable is now being worked out with the government. Sources say this is not because of the parliamentary timetable slipping. The government has been making such efficient use of the guillotine and its majority to rush through any amendments that John Whittingdale, the shadow culture secretary, said it meant MPs on the standing committee had failed in their task of scrutinising the bill. It is because the task of setting up Ofcom is enormous, even with the new Ofcom chief executive Stephen Carter starting earlier than expected, and difficult to sort out. Although he started several weeks earlier than originally planned, sources say Mr Carter is making sure he puts his imprint on the place by taking his time over appointing the key top five directors to run the different, merged directorates. These are directors of competition, content, corporate affairs, regulatory strategy and research. In a separate development today, newspaper bosses have piled on the pressure not to have press mergers or acquisitions come under the aegis of Ofcom. The managing director of Associated Newspapers, Murdoch MacLennan, said: \"Competition issues relating to newspapers should be left with the competition commission, which has decades of experience, extensive case history and commands wide respect. \"Instead of dealing with the office of fair trading and the competition commission, we will also have to work with Ofcom and finally the Secretary of State. \"Ofcom is being created out of the ashes of existing regulators covering television, radio and telecoms. Staff from those areas have no experience of newspapers. \"Worse, they are used to dealing with licensed services, and in broadcasting with the need to regulate content. \"I would therefore ask Ms Hewitt, what possible vital experience can these people bring to the party?\" Mr MacLennan added: \"I believe at the end of the day, public interest issues are well taken care of by the highly respected press complaints commission and that Ofcom is just another step towards censorship of the press through dangerous and damaging legislation, coupled with more bureaucracy and interference.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
