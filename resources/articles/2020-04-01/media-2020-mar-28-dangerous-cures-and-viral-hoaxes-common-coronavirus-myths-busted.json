The misinformation is most prevalent on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and text messaging. Despite companies like Facebook and Google trying to flag the more widely spread fraudulent news, some of it is unavoidable. With that in mind, we\u2019re correcting the record on some of the more common coronavirus myths being shared right now. Hot water doesn\u2019t kill it A myth that just won\u2019t go away is that coronavirus can be killed by water over 27C. \u201cThe average temperature of a human body is somewhere around 37C (98.6 F), which means that if this myth were true no one would ever get sick. It\u2019s also worth noting that you can\u2019t \u2018kill\u2019 a virus, because it\u2019s not technically alive in the first place, so this idea is doubly wrong,\u201d epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz said. Chloroquine is not a proven cure The anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, and the similar compound chloroquine, is currently used mostly for patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have potentially severe, and even deadly, side effects if used inappropriately, including heart failure and toxicity. This drug is currently being promoted as a potential cure by US president Donald Trump and Australian mining magnate Clive Palmer. Meyerowitz-Katz said the suggestion chloroquine could cure the virus was based on a seriously flawed paper. \u201cOther medications that have been promoted as miracle cures for coronavirus have not held up to closer scrutiny either. Yes, some drugs might improve survivability with the disease, but at the moment all we have is theories and hope, not good evidence that you can be cured using fish tank cleaner.\u201d Drinking lots of water won\u2019t prevent it While drinking water is good, you can\u2019t prevent coronavirus by simply keeping your throat moist. \u201cIt is very simply not true that you can prevent viral infection by drinking water, if for no other reason than the main method of transmission for coronavirus appears to be droplets landing on surfaces, not virus stuck in your throat,\u201d Meyerowitz-Katz said. Herd immunity would mean hundreds of thousands of deaths For herd immunity to be effective without a vaccine, Meyerowitz-Katz says somewhere between 60% and 70% of all people would have to be infected. That would mean hundreds of thousands of deaths at the very least. Blow drying your face and nose doesn\u2019t help A persistent myth is that hot air or saunas can kill off coronavirus. The WHO has said hand dryers alone do not have any impact on coronavirus, while others have warned that putting a blowdryer on your face, mouth, or up your nose can cause damage without having any impact on coronavirus. Your local hospital isn\u2019t giving out miracle prevention tips If you\u2019ve seen a viral post that looks like the one below, claiming to be from a hospital mentioning several of the above methods to avoid coronavirus, then it\u2019s not true. Busloads of people aren\u2019t clearing shelves in regional towns There has been a lot of misinformation, largely targeted at the Asian community in Australia, claiming that organised groups of people are hoarding goods and emptying supermarket shelves. Persistent rumours, particularly on talkback radio about busloads of people travelling to regional towns to clear the shelves in panic buys, have so far not been substantiated. A Footscray factory isn\u2019t hoarding supplies to ship to China Another claim spreading on Facebook is that a factory in Footscray, Victoria was stockpiling food and medical supplies to ship back to China. Victoria Police investigated and found the claims to be false. This is separate from the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s report that at least two Chinese development companies have reportedly been shipping back medical supplies to China. 5G has nothing to do with coronavirus In the United Kingdom in recent weeks the mobile phone towers of some of the country\u2019s telecommunications companies have been targeted as conspiracies linking the rollout of 5G networks across the country to coronavirus have been floated online. This week, YouTube announced it would suppress videos linking coronavirus to 5G. One popular video claiming to feature a former executive at a UK telco confirming the conspiracy theory has been removed from YouTube several times, but keeps being uploaded. Variations of this video have also been posted in anti-5G Facebook groups in Australia. The national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, told Reuters that any claim of a connection between 5G and coronavirus is \u201cutter rubbish\u201d. \u201cThe 5G story is complete and utter rubbish, it\u2019s nonsense, it\u2019s the worst kind of fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that the mobile phone networks are absolutely critical to all of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
