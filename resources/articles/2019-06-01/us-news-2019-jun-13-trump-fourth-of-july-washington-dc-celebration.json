The president is poised to take a starring role at the commemoration of US independence from British rule, by delivering an address from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, located at the far end of the National Mall in Washington DC from the US Capitol, according to reports. Although the White House has remained silent on the details, prompting confusion, Trump\u2019s expected involvement has been criticized for injecting politics into a historically nonpartisan tradition. \u201cThe president politicizes everything he touches and uses national symbols and institutions for his own purpose. One concern is his doing this with July 4,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. \u201cRather than being part of the celebration or even attending the celebration, he will make it about himself and he will make it political.\u201d Trump first previewed his plans in late February, tweeting: \u201cHOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th. It will be called \u2018A Salute To America\u2019 and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!\u201d Last week, the Washington Post reported that Trump had \u201ceffectively taken charge\u201d of the celebrations and forced the US capital\u2019s fireworks display to move from the National Mall and closer to the Potomac River. But little else is known about his agenda, prompting local officials to lament being left in the dark. The possibility of the holiday being \u201cTrumpified\u201d, they said, raised both logistical concerns and threatened to disrupt one of Washington\u2019s busiest days of the year. \u201cThe city is scrambling to figure out what to do, because all they have is the outline of what [the White House] wants,\u201d Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia\u2019s representative in Congress, told the Associated Press. \u201cThis will be all sorts of headaches for security.\u201d Protesters have already sprung into action in anticipation of Trump\u2019s activities. The activist group Code Pink on Monday requested a protest permit from the National Park Service, and potential plans include flying the \u201cBaby Trump\u201d blimp featured during his trips to London, as he delivers his Fourth of July remarks. Democrats in Congress have meanwhile urged Trump to reconsider his plans, warning that his planned appearance \u201ccould create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally\u201d on the American taxpayer\u2019s dime. \u201cFor decades, the Fourth of July on the National Mall has been nonpartisan and apolitical,\u201d the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, natural resources committee chairman, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, and Minnesota representative Betty McCollum, who chairs a subcommittee on the House appropriations panel, wrote in a letter to Trump. \u201cWe respectfully call on you to look for ways to complement, not conflict with, the Fourth of July celebration, such as considering an earlier time or alternative location for your remarks.\u201d Testifying before Congress in May, Trump\u2019s interior secretary, David Bernhardt, insisted the president\u2019s speech was not designed to promote himself and would be nonpartisan in tone. \u201cI think the president is excited about the idea, and we\u2019re working hard on it, and I think it could be very, very meaningful,\u201d Bernhardt said. \u201cThe president loves the idea, as probably all Americans do, of celebrating America on the Fourth of July, or thereabouts.\u201d He also sought to pacify lawmakers who questioned the use of taxpayer dollars for what could quickly amount to a campaign event and risk violating federal spending laws, stating: \u201cI will make absolutely sure that every dollar we spend will comply with the law \u2013 I will promise you that.\u201d Despite his administration\u2019s assurances, Trump\u2019s plans mark a departure from how his predecessors have observed the Fourth of July. Previous presidents have typically delivered remarks honoring US troops or hosting events with military families at the White House. There has been occasional controversy, Zelizer said, such as Richard Nixon playing a video message on the National Mall in 1970 during antiwar protests and Ronald Reagan\u2019s interior secretary, James Watt, temporarily banning the Beach Boys from performing at a Fourth of July concert in 1983. But Trump\u2019s plans, he noted, were yet another way in which the president was \u201cchallenging, destabilizing and unsettling American institutions\u201d. \u201cHe is willing to go further than most in taking things over for his own purpose without concern for tradition and history. This is a prime example of that.\u201d Anita McBride, the executive in residence at the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, was not concerned. \u201cPeople are always going to question change and perhaps unfairly draw conclusions,\u201d said McBride, who served in both the Reagan and George HW Bush administrations. \u201cThe important thing is that our presidents find ways to celebrate and recognize this incredibly important holiday for our nation.\u201d But Bill Kristol, a conservative commentator and vocal Trump critic, described the president\u2019s desire to put himself at the center of the national holiday as a \u201cthird world\u201d tactic. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make it a celebration of Trump America instead of just a celebration of American independence,\u201d Kristol said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally contrary to the spirit of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
