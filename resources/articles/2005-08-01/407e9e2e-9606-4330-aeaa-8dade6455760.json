And no international batsman personifies the virtue of winning ugliness more completely than Justin Langer. While Thursday's hectic events continued at one end yesterday, Langer sponsored a one-man campaign for the restoration of old-fashioned Test match values at the other, a game within a game that made few concessions to aesthetics and was probably best appreciated while he was at the non-striker's end - where he was, with his customary self-deprecation, almost 60% of the time. If it wasn't attractive, Australia would have been in considerably better heart last night after another Langer innings of obduracy. As it is, few episodes of The Simpsons can have caused such a chorus of \"Doh!\" as the one screened on Channel 4 at 6pm yesterday which curtailed a game so full of possibility. The rough out of which Shane Warne has now twice bowled Andrew Strauss also gave Ashley Giles considerable encouragement yesterday and holds ample promise for England, given that Australia will bat last here with four left-handers in their top seven. First, to what has been rather than what may be. It was once said that you could tell the English season had begun by the sounds of the leather on willow and the thud of the ball on Brian Close's body. Something similar may soon be said of Langer, who wore his third delivery from Steve Harmison roughly where he wore his second at Lord's, as though to ascertain the level of English solicitousness. Curiosity apparently unsatisfied, he then absorbed a blow in the sternum, while his gloves took a veritable pounding all day. Yet even Langer's attire suggested he had a long entrenchment in mind yesterday: helmeted, sweatered, heavily padded, long-sleeved shirt buttoned to his chin with the collar turned up, he seemed almost encased, in a way that matched his natural limits. Langer is the original nudger and nurdler. He sweats on the cover drive but needs the ball in the slot to stroke it fluently, for his bottom hand takes control when he tries to hit on the up. His get-out-of-jail shot against slow bowling is the slog-sweep, but Michael Vaughan posted a man to the provinces on the leg side immediately yesterday and eliminated the option. Australian progressed before lunch at the run a minute that England made de rigueur on Thursday, with an accompanying whiff of danger. Ricky Ponting might have run himself out before belting the first of his 12 boundaries. Damien Martyn's inside edge just eluded a diving Geraint Jones, like rather a lot yesterday, while his outside edge through where third slip should have been was the cue for hands on heads as surely as Simon Says. Langer, meanwhile, was batting almost without trace, not facing his 50th delivery until a quarter of an hour to lunch, and his 100th until 2.25pm. Somehow, his 50 was timed at a mere 173 minutes; perhaps they were the kind of minutes experienced on the Northern Line, where one is invited to Morden at the very next tick of the clock yet is somehow still standing there 10 minutes later. Langer, after more than four and a half hours, even suc cumbed in a very Langeresque way. Like another Australian left-hander, Bill Lawrie, who was known to ignore flattened stumps while complaining about the terrible looseness of modern soil, Langer is hard to budge even when out. He looked askance at Rudi Koertzen's lbw decision yesterday, and Hawk Eye suggested that the stumps would merely have sustained a graze. It wasn't the umpiring that let Langer down yesterday, however, but his fellows. Not least of these were Martyn, who seemed almost as surprised by Vaughan's athleticism at mid-wicket as Vaughan's team-mates, and Warne, so mesmerised by the voluptuousness of Simon Jones' outcurves that he came prematurely at Giles - as People might report it. Even Ponting essayed a shot, the sweep, which is one of the few he has never quite mastered. But the batsman who owed Langer most was his old mucker Matthew Hayden, who shovelled his first ball to extra cover as though still receiving his morning ration of throw-downs. In 1989, Terry Alderman achieved a celebrated eclipse of Graham Gooch by the expedient of posting a short mid-wicket. Gooch was never caught there, but with a productive gap plugged began losing his usual balance at the crease and stumbled into a nightmarish streak of lbws. The placement of Kevin Pietersen at short mid-off about 15 metres from the bat yesterday, an area through which Hayden favours blazing early in his innings, seemed similarly to cloud Hayden's judgment. With 708 runs in his last 25 innings at 28.32, the time he has to clarify his thoughts is now diminishing. To concentrate too much on Australian failures, however, would be to shortchange England, who came at their visitors with the ball as they had with the bat, as though Lord's was just a hallucination. Giles was the pick of the attack, effective to some well-set fields, and undoing Michael Clarke with an inventive seamer he should use more often. Simon Jones bowled an incisive spell of reverse swing to an unremitting off-stump line, while Andy Flintoff certainly makes a welcome change from the tradition of English all-rounders whose batting and bowling were as well-matched as the halves of a pantomime horse. Between them, they subdued Adam Gilchrist yesterday in a corner out of which he has often come fighting. Under Ponting, Australia have been a resourceful side, capable of feats of Houdini-like escapology. Last year in Sri Lanka, for example, they won three consecutive Tests after trailing on first innings. But with Glenn McGrath out, the calculus of this match now looks very different to that being undertaken as late as at 9.14am on Thursday. Langer doubtless has ample ugliness left in him; the winning, from here, will be very difficult indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
