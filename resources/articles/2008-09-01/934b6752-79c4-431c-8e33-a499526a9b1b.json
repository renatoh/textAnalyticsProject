Jackson's restrained performance takes some of the near-pornographic heat out of the situation, but it's still a really daft deep-south melodrama. Atonement (Joe Wright, 2007) 10.15pm, Sky Movies Drama This intelligent and beautifully crafted adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel opens in the languid heat of summer, 1935, where a lie told by the jealous 13-year-old Briony (Saoirse Ronan) ruins the lives of posh Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and her working-class lover, Robbie (James McAvoy). From stately home to the chaos of Dunkirk, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's grip never falters, in a compassionate tale of love, class and war. The New World (Terrence Malick, 2005) 11pm, Film4 On the Virginia coast in 1608, colonial settlers from the old world set foot on the new. Among them is Colin Farrell's John Smith, who is smitten by native-American princess Pocahontas (played, luminously, by the Peruvian Q'orianka Kilcher). It's a love pitted against greed, fear and savage violence in Malick's awesome, dreamlike vision of paradise lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
