Shedding a manager on the eve of a potentially pivotal relegation contest left them rudderless and, theoretically, vulnerable, though to judge by the body language they have been liberated by the departure of Lawrie Sanchez. The caretaker manager, Ray Lewington, had barely had time to assess his options, having assumed the reins on Friday, but spoke of his players being \"realistic, not cynical\" about the change at the top after arresting a run of three defeats to hoist the Cottagers out of the bottom three. The squad had merely relished an end to the direct style that marked the deposed manager's spell in charge. \"We had a bit more freedom to express ourselves, playing a bit more and passing it through the middle,\" said Clint Dempsey. \"It was like a weight off our shoulders.\" The pressure remains. They revelled only in patches here, though regular watchers would concur that, with the passes honed to shorter range, the spectacle was a lot easier on the eye than it has been. Sanchez might have been spared had his direct approach yielded more rewards but the former Northern Ireland manager spent heavily last summer and won only three Premier League games in his eight months at Fulham. Whether his replacement is Martin Jol or John Collins, the most plausible candidates under consideration at present, the London club will expect a slicker approach than Sanchez's more direct style in future. Fulham certainly boast the players to edge clear of trouble. What they lack is self-belief. \"You could sense the tension in how we'd been playing,\" said Danny Murphy. \"A cloud had come over us. I wouldn't say we felt sorry for ourselves but we were going into each game thinking: 'Here we go again.'\" Lewington has been told he will be considered for the permanent role. \"But the club will look outside,\" he said, adding that, while the congestion of games at this time of year might hamper an appointment, there is a need for urgency with the transfer window opening next week. Despite Lewington's utterings, this was a mishmash of a game, with Fulham playing much of the football but Wigan boasting almost all of the thrust, particularly once the ineffective Julius Aghahowa had been replaced by Antoine Sibierski. Marcus Bent's thumping shot after Michael Brown's hoist and Titus Bramble's back header had speared Wigan ahead with 20 minutes left but their defence is so porous there was always likely to be an equaliser. Dempsey's smart finish after Chris Kirkland had been lured to his near post as Diomansy Kamara squirted his shot across the area duly hauled the home side level eight minutes later. Yet the best chance of victory fell to Wigan's Antonio Valencia, released by Sibierski, even if there was doubt etched across the Ecuadorian's brow as he bore down on goal. Antti Niemi's save was ultimatelya formality. \"But it's still a point away from home and we haven't managed one of them for a while,\" said Bent, his goal ending a run of seven defeats on the road. \"The lads are coming out of their shells at the moment and getting their confidence back.\" That bodes well for Wigan under the recently arrived Steve Bruce. Fulham must hope their own appointment can offer up a similar sense of revival. Man of the match Ryan Taylor (Wigan Athletic)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
