The state government is proposing to raise the walls of the Warragamba Dam by 14 metres to mitigate the impact of floods \u2013 a move that environmental activists say would flood Unesco-protected bushland, and endanger 50 historic Indigenous sites. A draft report examining the impact of the dam, seen by Guardian Australia, said it would \u201chave an overall high direct (physical) impact\u201d, \u201cresult in permanent environmental changes\u201d, affect 1,300 hectares, and affect those Aboriginal historical sites. The leaked draft is an assessment of the impact on non-Aboriginal heritage \u2013 known as an HIA \u2013 which is a part of the broader environmental impact statement, which has not been finalised. The full EIS is due later in the year, and will then be made publicly available. The draft report said: \u201cThe proposed increase in inundation levels \u2026 would result in permanent environmental changes to the ecosystems and ecology of these areas. The minister for western Sydney, Stuart Ayres, said raising the dam was important to \u201creduce the existing risk to life and property on the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain\u201d. \u201cThe final decision to raise the wall has not yet been made and will only take place after financial, environmental and cultural assessments have concluded. \u201cWhile there will be environmental impacts from temporarily holding flood water from behind a raised dam wall, they must be measured against the social and financial impact a catastrophic flood would have on Western Sydney communities.\u201d The greater Blue Mountains area is heritage listed for its biodiversity and rare flora such as eucalypts and Wollemi pine, and Indigenous historical sites. Last week, Unesco advisers raised concerns over the dam plan and asked the state government to consult with the world heritage committee and share its environmental impact statements, before making a decision. A final environmental impact statement is not due until later in 2019. And any decision to raise the dam would need the approval of federal environment minister due to the heritage listing. But the draft report said the dam proposal would affect 1,300ha, which is 0.12% of the heritage listed area. \u201cThe project would result in an overall high direct (physical) impact \u2026 [and] would result in visual changes to affected portions of the greater Blue Mountains area within the raised inundation levels, mainly by way of scarring. \u201cIncreased inundation levels and duration upstream of the dam wall would additionally impact occupation sites and deposits within the greater Blue Mountains area that provide tangible evidence of the place\u2019s longstanding Aboriginal connections.\u201d The NSW opposition environment spokeswoman, Penny Sharpe, said the dam plan was driven by a \u201crapacious development agenda\u201d and should be abandoned. \u201cInstead of improving flood evacuation routes in the Nepean Valley, the real agenda here is for the government to open up more urban development to house an extra 134,000 new residents on the floodplain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Berejiklian government has been understating the impact on the world heritage area. Campaigner Harry Burkitt, from community group Give a Dam, said the federal government should step in. \u201cThe world heritage area impacted is more than 4.5 times Sydney\u2019s CBD,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than double what Minister Ayres has admitted to parliament and the public. \u201cThe world is watching Australia, and the federal government needs to act and stop this developer driven dam project. It would be nothing other than a national disgrace if the Australian government approved the dam and the Blue Mountains lost its world heritage status.\u201d The report noted that areas both upstream and downstream of the dam would be affected. But the impact on downstream areas would be \u201cnegligible\u201d, it found. \u201cAreas downstream of the dam wall will see a reduction in flood heights and extension of flood duration\u2026The overall impact observed from the six events examined downstream would only affect small areas on the edge of the greater Blue Mountains area curtilage around Colo and Colo Heights. \u201cThe impacts in these areas across the six scenarios are considered to be negligible given the nature of the flood mitigation impact of the project.\u201d This article was amended on 14 June 2019. A previous version had two versions of the area affected, the correct measurement is 1,300 hectares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
