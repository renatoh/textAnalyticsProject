But it's only on this side of the Pennines that it really comes into its own (having been employed ingeniously to join the scaffolding used in the building of Blackpool Tower). Parts of the country's first motorway (the Preston bypass) were surfaced with reconstituted twine, while it's not unknown for engine drivers at Carnforth to strengthen their couplings with it in preparation for the run up to Shap. When Kipling was talking of east and west it was, of course, a coded reference to the wars of the roses, hence his coining the expression \"never the twine shall meet\". Chris Haughton Preesall, Lancashire \u2022\u2008Full Norfolk toolkit: 3-in-One Oil to get it going, binder twine to keep it stopped. Malcolm Redfellow London \u2022\u2008Your article (Pick up a Penguin: publisher celebrates 75th anniversary, 31 July) does not mention that Penguin books was the brainchild of Allen Lane and his colleague at Bodley Head, Krishna Menon.

Instead the seed heads are visited by flocks of goldfinches. Another good reason for growing such plants in the garden and not consigning them to the countryside. Janet Gyford Witham, Essex \u2022\u2008Working at a bookstore in London's Piccadilly many years ago, I was asked by a very aristocratic-looking lady if we had any books about \"Skites\" (Letters, 31 July). After several failed attempts to decipher what she wanted, in desperation she said: \"You know, Skites \u2026 Skites and Brinies \u2026 founded by Baden-Powell!\" Steve Liversedge Jaywick, Essex \u2022\u2008Over Auckland airport's PA I heard the Kiwi operative requesting a stray passenger to \"proceed to the chicken zone\".
