Unfortunately, this is not it. Conceived by Beatles tribute band-turned-theatre company Rain, it simply offers an evening of faithfully executed Beatles hits. This kind of show is normally dubbed a juke-box musical, but I'd call it Tussaud Theatre: it asks us to gaze for a couple of hours on replicas of reality. What happens is that four guys who bear a passing resemblance to John, Paul, George and Ringo come on stage and steer us through the Beatles catalogue. They start with the joyous songs of innocence, such as She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand, and move on to the multilayered songs of experience, such as Strawberry Fields Forever and Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. Periodically, contact is made with the rest of us: John Lennon repeats his famous injunction to a Royal Variety Performance audience (\"Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands. And the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery\") and we are periodically bidden to our feet to scream and shout. The whole evening, however, is an exercise in faintly necrophiliac nostalgia. For some, this may be enough. But I craved much more. I wanted some hint of the growing divisions between Lennon and McCartney, and the tensions between individual self-expression and the group's collective identity. The show also misses a trick in its use of two screens, shaped like 1960s TV sets, on either side of the proscenium arch. They are used either to offer blown-up images of the stage action or atmospheric film footage: we see excited American teenagers at the 1965 Shea Stadium concert, quaint cigarette ads from the 60s or dissolving hallucinogenic patterns from the Sgt Pepper period. Aside from fleeting shots of the Vietnam war protests, however, we get little sense of the swiftly changing politics of the 60s and the way youthful disillusion with the military-industrial complex shaped Lennon's music. In short, this is just another tribute show. It is well performed and, from a rotating company, the team I saw was impressive: Reuven Gershon as John, Emmanuele Angeletti as Paul, Stephen Hill as George and Phil Martin as Ringo, with Ryan Alex Farmery providing keyboard support. But I go to the theatre hoping to be surprised, challenged or given a new perspective on reality. What I don't want is to see the musical, of all forms, turned into a gaudy museum. \u2022 What have you been to see lately?
