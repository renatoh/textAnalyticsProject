Nor does he have ethnic prints hanging from the walls of his student digs. And he's never once started a sentence with \"When I was in Tasmania ...\" The 21-year-old Durham University student is confident that his gap-year experience was \"authentic\" and \"unique\". \"I became part of the community and a member of the family I was staying with - I still am,\" he says. The second-year geographer from Reading spent his year before university teaching outdoor pursuits to under-12s at the Friends school in north Hobart, Tasmania. The experience cost him and his parents approximately &amp;pounds;10,000. At the same time, Danny McDonnell was putting in the hours to earn money for the geography degree he is now doing at Portsmouth University. McDonnell spent half a year taking blood from patients at St Helier hospital, Surrey, and the other half organising children's holiday camps. The 21-year-old from Epsom, Surrey, made sure the pounds 2,000 he had left at the end lasted his whole first year at university. \"We don't have that much money, and my mum and dad wouldn't have had the money to support me through university if I hadn't worked in my gap year. I would have felt guilty taking it from them if they had given it to me,\" he says. University researchers dedicated to the academic study of the gap year will meet for the first time tomorrow at their inaugural conference at Surrey University, which will bring together sociologists, educationists and geographers. Their research papers have at least one finding in common: there is a widening gulf between the middle-class and the working-class gap year. Year abroad Dr Andrew Jones, head of geography at Birkbeck College, London, describes a typical middle-class teenager's gap year as one spent abroad as a volunteer on a farm, at an African school, or on an environmental conservation project preserving reefs and turtles. Other popular options for the privileged include Camp America and working in the ski industry. The less advantaged are far more likely to earn money by working locally in factories and bars. They may take a school-leaver's job as work experience before they start university, he says. But Jones says it would be unfair to see the experiences of teenagers from poor and rich backgrounds as entirely polarised. \"All have some time off from work. Many of the less well-off 18-year-olds are extremely driven and fundraise in order to go on the volunteering programmes that the gap-year industry offers. But, yes, we are finding that there is growing division between what the most and least affluent teenagers are doing.\" The academics refuse to be drawn on whether tuition fees of &amp;pounds;3,000, introduced in England last autumn, will kill off the prospect of a pre-university gap year for the hard-up. But the likelihood is that the gulf between the rich and the poor gap-year experience will widen. High prices This is something the international development charity Voluntary Service Overseas reluctantly recognises. It blames the high prices of some of its rivals. \"An entire gap-year industry was born a couple of years ago in response to demand from all ages, not just those between school and university,\" says Abigail Fulbrook, a VSO spokeswoman. \"Students from all backgrounds should look for meaningful work which has a long-term gain.\" Quest, which describes itself as a \"development travel company\", offers a four-week trip to Malawi building community centres for orphans for &amp;pounds;1,465, excluding flights and insurance. Those with more time to travel can go on a three-month expedition to Brazil for &amp;pounds;4,920, again excluding flights and insurance. And Venture Company takes gap-year students on an Inca trip for 12 weeks for &amp;pounds;4,365. Mike Lamb, education manager at Quest, says the trips his company run can cost thousands of pounds because they provide long-term help in developing countries. \"The expense can be easily justified. It should cost the local communities nothing to have these unskilled volunteers staying with them. The cost of the trip ensures this. We are not embarrassed by how much our projects cost. The money is going to the right place.\" Academics presenting papers at tomorrow's conference say that, despite the emergence of a working-class gap year, the majority of those taking a year off between school and university are from middle-class backgrounds. Tara Duncan, managing editor for journals at the Royal Geographic Society, says: \"Unfortunately our research shows the gap year is still a middle-class phenomenon - and a white, rather than ethnic minority, one at that. But that is changing. Volunteering organisations are targeting a wider market and the growing numbers of gappers from south-east Asia will have a knock-on effect on ethnic minorities in the UK.\" Andy King, an associate lecturer in sociology at Surrey University, hopes a book will come out of the papers being presented at the conference, which he is organising. \"It's high time academics actually met to discuss their body of work in this area.\" He estimates that the number of academics whose research looks, in some way, at the gap year has doubled in the past few years, to roughly 15 in the UK. Research on gap years is attractive to academics interested in young people's transition into adulthood and the development of social skills. It also gets the attention of experts on travel, tourism and education. Duncan believes the growing interest stems partly from the fact that many of the field's researchers wanted to write about and discuss their own gap years. Dr Kate Simpson, a visiting fellow in geography at the University of Newcastle, describes their work as \"a classic case of academics responding to a popular phenomenon\". Yet there is a demand for their research. Apart from a general public interest in gap years, graduate recruiters are keen to know whether - and how - a bungee jump in South Africa translates into a transferable skill in the workplace. Taking a gap year between school and university (and at other times as well) is becoming increasingly common, the academics will say tomorrow. Jones says that, unfortunately, as is often the case with new research topics, precise statistics do not exist. But a study he led for the Department for Education and Skills in 2004 leads him to estimate that 50,000 teenagers will defer university this year, or apply later, so that they can take a gap year. A few years ago, he says, the figure was closer to 30,000. A new popular option is to take a catering course in Italy. But bar work in Australia, travelling in South America, fruit picking and environmental conservation projects are still favourites. Addictive But beware, the researchers say, gap years are addictive. \"There are increasing numbers of people who are taking three gap years: one after A-levels, another after university and a third a couple of years into their careers,\" says Duncan. Some people argue a gap year can be pointless. \"We give young people a lot of kudos for travelling to shanty towns, but what do they actually learn?\" Simpson says. \"Just seeing something doesn't actually teach them about it. It just shows them that the world is very diverse.\" But that is precisely what makes some admissions tutors favour gap-year returnees as their students. Peter Lewis, admissions tutor for English and drama at Loughborough University, might give a student who misses their grades another chance if they have taken a gap year. \"Students who have taken gap years have gone through the jolly japes of puberty when they start university. They understand that the world is different in different places and they appreciate things more because of that,\" he says. \"The first thing I look at is their personal profile. It is very important for me to see what they say they have done, or are going to do, in a gap year. Are they going to write a journal, for example? \"If a youngster has only just missed their grades and has taken a gap year, I might interview them. But not if they have been lying on the beach or going surfing for the year. That does nothing much for anyone - except improve their tan.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
