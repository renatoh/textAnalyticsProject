Others think football can only come home to Wembley. Some say there is no need at all for a new stadium. Yet more insist it should be in the Midlands. The Aston Villa chairman, Doug Ellis, said: \"It's a disgraceful decision. They have chosen Wembley temporarily. They have made conditions on their bid. \"Tessa Jowell said in the House of Commons that if they can't produce the necessary finances it comes back to Birmingham immediately. \"I believe Wembley is the next Millennium Dome. There will be a lot of tears if they continue with this project.\" Ann Lucas of Coventry city council, which has given planning permission to a brownfield site that could be home to the cheapest bid, said: \"We are extremely disappointed to have been ruled out and we feel certain that the authorities will face severe hurdles before the realisation of a national stadium at Wembley. \"When do they want a national stadium? It will take years to get Wembley up and running, by which time the so-called mystique surrounding that name will have dissipated. \"We would have staged our first match in 2004, which is years ahead of the chosen site.\" The development officer of the Football Supporters' Association, Steven Powell, said: \"The whole national stadium debate has turned into a catalogue of catastrophes. \"No other consumer industry would even think about embarking on such a major project without the most detailed research amongst its customers. \"If the stadium capacity is reduced to 80,000 to cut costs, it's likely that the allocation of tickets for competing clubs in cup finals and for big England matches will be reduced from a level that's already too low to accommodate the fans who follow their team and country, rain and shine. \"Some even question whether there should be a national stadium at all. Many top countries don't have one. Italy, Germany and Brazil are just a few examples.\" The England coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, said: \"Wembley is the most famous stadium in the world, every footballer has heard of it and dreams of playing there. \"The new Wembley will accommodate 90,000 fans. Just imagine the atmosphere - the fans can sometimes make the difference between winning and losing. \"I am very excited about seeing an England team playing once again at the home of football.\" FA executive member and Leeds United chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"On the assumption that it's Wembley it's right because that is where it was going to be from the start. \"It is replacing a stadium that became the home of football and I think Wembley stadium has special memories for a lot of people. \"If ultimately that is the decision which is announced, we can build something for the nation to be proud of which would be good for football.\" Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, said: \"I agree with the FA: Wembley is the first choice - let's now go for it. Retaining the national football stadium at Wembley was the only viable option, and I am delighted that this announcement today has confirmed the case that London has put from day one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
