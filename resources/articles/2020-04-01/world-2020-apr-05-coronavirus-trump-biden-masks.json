Donald Trump said on Friday he would not wear a mask, despite new guidelines issued by the White House that day \u2013 and announced from the Briefing Room podium by the president \u2013 for people to wear face coverings in public places. In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Biden also defended his work as vice-president in the Obama administration in terms of preparing for such a pandemic. Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for the federal government\u2019s slow and disjointed response to the arrival on US soil of Covid-19, the virus which by Sunday had infected more than 312,000 Americans and killed nearly 8,500. At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters \u201cthe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure\u201d. But he added: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d. The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others. Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said Trump had dismantled. \u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving. \u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem. \u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response. \u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019? \u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership. Mobilize the industrial base of the United States, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d On ABC, Biden also weighed in on the controversial dismissal of the US navy captain Brett Crozier, calling it \u201cclose to criminal\u201d. Capt Crozier was removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt this week after he wrote a memo about concerns for his crew on the aircraft carrier with coronavirus cases aboard. Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday Trump criticized him for writing the letter. \u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that\u2019s nuclear-powered.\u201d The defense secretary, Mark Esper, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday \u201cthere is an investigation ongoing\u201d but repeated that he supported the decision to fire Crozier because Thomas Modly, the acting navy secretary, had lost confidence in him. \u201cWhen all those facts come to bear we\u2019ll have a chance to understand\u201d why the decision was taken, Esper said. Esper also dismissed reports that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d Biden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy. The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger \u2026 Look how many have the virus. \u201cI think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.\u201d Esper also appeared on ABC, where he said US military personnel would soon be required to wear masks on duty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
