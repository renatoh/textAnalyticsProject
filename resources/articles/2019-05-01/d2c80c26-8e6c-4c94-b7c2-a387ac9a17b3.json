The ad, posted to Gillette\u2019s Facebook page, features Toronto-based artist Samson Bonkeabantu Brown shaving with some coaching from his father. \u201cI always knew I was different. I didn\u2019t know there was a term for the type of person that I was. I went into my transition just wanting to me happy. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m able to shave,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m at the point in my manhood where I\u2019m actually happy.\u201d His father offers pointers as Brown takes the razor to his shaving cream-covered face. \u201cNow don\u2019t be scared. Shaving is about being confident. You\u2019re doing fine,\u201d the father says. The ad features the tagline: \u201cWhenever, wherever, however it happens \u2013 your first shave is special.\u201d The shaving company was bombarded with praise and abuse earlier this year after it launched an advertising campaign inspired by the #MeToo movement, promoting positive masculinity. Brown said he was honored to share his story in this new advert, and especially wanted to include his father, who has supported his transition as a transgender man. \u201cI shot this ad for Gillette and wanted to include my father, who has been one of my greatest supporters throughout my transition, encouraging me to be confident and live authentically as my best self,\u201d he said in a Facebook post. \u201cI was able to share an important milestone in every man\u2019s life with my father. This moment overwhelmed me during filming and again today seeing the ad since it\u2019s been launched. I\u2019m keenly aware of how blessed I am to be able to exist in this world being supported by my family in ways that all too often many of my trans brothers, sisters, and siblings who exist outside the binary are not always as fortunate.\u201d The ad, which has been viewed more than a million times, drew a supportive reaction, including from other trans men who said they could relate to the experience. \u201cMy first shave was made with my husband because my dad passed away years before I started to transition last year and thank you! This makes me feel so good this morning at work,\u201d Lee Stephens wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis commercial made me cry,\u201d wrote Asher Shaun Jensen. \u201cYou have videos on how to shave on your YouTube which helped immensely as my dad does not support me. You\u2019re making a difference, and I appreciate it greatly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
