The decision, which drew a line under years of bitter opposition to the controversial extraction process, was taken after a new scientific study from the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) warned it was not possible to rule out \u201cunacceptable\u201d consequences for those living near fracking sites. We want to hear from those who lived locally to the UK\u2019s only active fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire, or to a site which was either granted or in the process of applying for planning permission. Share your experiences We are interested in hearing from people who lived locally to planned or active fracking sites in England, and were involved in activism to bring the process to a halt. How did you protest? Has the experience changed your views on the effectiveness of campaigning? What assurances would you like for the future?
