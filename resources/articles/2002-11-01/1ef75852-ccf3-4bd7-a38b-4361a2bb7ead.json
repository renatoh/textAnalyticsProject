The Manchester derby, for instance, was not about Ferguson v Keegan, as some commentators suggested, and certainly not - as Ron Atkinson wrote in this paper on Friday - merely a matter of three league points. Viewed from Moss Side, the match was part of the historic struggle in Manchester to determine who's top and who's bobbins. Bobbins is a peculiarly Mancunian usage, I believe, so far not much adopted by those media types who like to affect the argot of the streets, who tend misguidedly to opt for its Geordie equivalent, \"pants\". For Scott Southern and Matt Maguire, however, in Sky's Fanzone on Saturday, \"bobbins\" was a key word, as the constraints of live broadcast forbade them anything much stronger. Well, more or less. Scott, representing United, set the tone for the afternoon, opening his commentary thus: \"Welcome to the last derby at this poxy little toilet they call Maine Road.\" Here was a man, you sensed, not angling for Barry Davies's job. As City lined up for the kick-off, Scott's assessment of their personnel was equally forthright: \"There's Tiatto - little muppet. Garbage. Thinks he's hard as nails.\" Normally the Fanzone, a feature of Sky's interactive coverage, is not worth bothering with, unless you feel the need to replace the seasoned professionalism of Martin Tyler and Andy Gray with the \"thoughts\" of opposing fans, who often fail miserably to abuse the rival team or libel its officials. Typically this alternative commentary will come from a pair of anoraks who intersperse shouts of \"come on, my son,\" with gobbets of inside information gleaned from someone who knows the brother of Lee Bowyer's window cleaner really well and can say for certain he's definitely not going to sign his contract. On Saturday, though, the Fanzone crackled with the kind of unbridled abuse and ill-considered asides for which it was surely designed. A shot of Martin Edwards, for instance, was accompanied by some off-colour remarks about toilet cubicles, a spot of giggling and this priceless exchange: \"He'll probably be out with Angus Deayton tonight, down Pandora's,\" said Matt. \"Pandora's box,\" countered Scott, and then, somewhat gnomically, as the camera switched to Nicolas Anelka, \"Well, that's the only box Anelka will be seeing tonight.\" Not Oscar Wilde, I grant you, but for exiled Mancunians wishing to recreate the atmosphere of a Miles Platting boozer in the comfort of their very own home, it was pretty effective. The leitmotif running through Scott and Matt's repartee was the long-running dispute over which set of supporters could boast the purer Mancunian provenance. Tribunals in Nazi Germany to determine questions of Aryan purity were probably conducted with less rigour than these discussions between Manchester football fans. The well-rehearsed argument that United draws much of its support from the south of England was countered by a strange tirade from Scott, who said the City fans would be \"getting their buses home soon, because they all live in Oldham or Stockport\". \"Scott, I live two minutes up the road from you, mate,\" said Matt, which seemed a fairly damning piece of evidence, but which nevertheless failed to deter Scott from his summing up: \"You're pissing second rate. You're garbage. Bobbins fans, garbage crowd.\" This argument might have been a clincher had Shaun Goater not chosen that moment to score his second goal. \"I love you, Shaun Goater,\" screamed Matt. \"I love you, I love you. The City fans are going so loud, I can't hear anything in my own head. Shaun Goater, I love you. The way I'm feeling now, I'm questioning my own sexuality, Scott.\" \"Everyone I know has been questioning it for years,\" replied a mournful Scott. \"I'm glad you have come out of the closet, live.\" It is a shame we don't get more of this kind of no-holds- barred interaction from John Motson and Trevor Brooking, say. Scott invariably called the City fans \"bitter Blues\", sometimes abbreviated, Manchester style, simply to bi-ahs. \"Look a' all them bi-ahs,\" he said, over a crowd shot. \"To think they've wasted a Giro on a football match.\" Considering Scott and Matt were denied the use of Britain's most popular four-letter word, which you felt might have peppered their conversation in other circumstances, they were making a pretty decent job of abusing each other and their teams. As well as accusing City fans of hailing from unfashionable towns on the outskirts of the Greater Manchester area, of being unemployable and of being jealous of United's success, Scott did not forget to remind his friend of the fact that City's own achievements were very much in the past. \"They've done a video of City's great victories,\" he said, \"It cost \u00a3200 - a quid for the tape and \u00a3199 for a Betamax machine to play it on.\" Sir Alex Ferguson was not laughing, though, on The Premiership, where he sort of agreed with Scott's verdict that United were bobbins. They had underachieved, he said, he was not happy and he had given them \"a bollocking\". We don't go in for euphemisms up north, you see; unlike Peter Drury, who spotted Sven and Nancy in the crowd at Highbury and remarked that Sven had brought \"the other half\". Other third, surely. martin@kelner.demon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
