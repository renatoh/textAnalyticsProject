Lord Black has until the end of Sunday to repay the cash - the first instalment of \u00a34m in payments that were not authorised by the company's board. He has already missed one deadline to pay up, but was granted a two-week extension, which expires at 5 o'clock on Monday morning British time. If he decides not to pay up by then, Hollinger will have to decide whether to give him another extension or to step up its efforts to recover the money. Spokesmen for both Lord Black and Hollinger International, where the Tory peer remains the controlling shareholder, today declined to comment. Lawyers for both sides now go into the weekend having failed to break the deadlock over the $850,000 payment. \"The lawyers have been talking, and they'll continue to talk until something happens,\" said one source close to the negotiations. Lord Black is being advised by John Warden, a lawyer at Sullivan and Cromwell, while Hollinger's legal team is led by Judith Thoyer of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton and Garrison. Mr Warden said last week that he was reviewing the implications of \"substantial additional material\" that had come to light regarding the payments. But Richard Breeden, who is leading Hollinger's special committee investigation into executive payments at the company insisted the question of whether the \u00a34m was authorised was \"not the subject of further review, inquiry or negotiation\". \"The so-called non-competition payments to individuals appear to have been engineered by individuals ultimately accountable to Lord Black, though we have not yet reached any conclusion with respect to Lord Black's knowledge of these arrangements,\" he said in a statement last week. It emerged in November that Lord Black, three other executives and the peer's holding company Hollinger Inc had received \u00a319m in payments that had not been authorised by Hollinger International's board. At the same time Lord Black stepped down as the company's chief executive and began work on a strategic review that could see the company or its assets sold. Since then financial watchdogs in the US and Canada have launched investigations into the payments, although Lord Black denies any wrongdoing over the affair. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
