After managing to fill Madison Square Garden to capacity on Saturday night for a wildly violent sparring session with the sacrificial lamb Rocky Fielding, that premise appears beyond dispute. \u00c1lvarez, the youngest of seven brothers who each boxed (once all together on the same card), turned professional at 16. He was still a teenager when he signed a contract with Televisa, the TV network known for telenovelas that is among the most watched in all of Latin America. Televisa built him into a household name with his red hair and matinee-idol good looks if not his still-young body of work. That led many sceptical Mexicans to denigrate him as a media creation or, worse, a fraud. To \u00c1lvarez\u2019s detractors he will always be the exposed 23-year-old made by Mayweather to appear as if he was stumbling around in the dark trying to find the light switch in their 2013 meeting. Even as he rebuilt admirably from the psychological wreckage of his lone professional setback, there was little about \u00c1lvarez that fitted the mould of the archetypal Mexican fistic warrior: from his fair skin and cinnamon-coloured hair to a counter-punching style at odds with the devil-may-care aggression, reckless pressure and machismo embodied by predecessors like Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Rub\u00e9n Olivares, Carlos Z\u00e1rate and Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez. There was also the perception that he was avoiding a match with his longtime middleweight bogeyman Gennady Golovkin, which became the most attractive fight that could be made in boxing after \u00c1lvarez won the division\u2019s lineal title from Miguel Cotto in his biggest win to that point. But \u00c1lvarez has continued to develop into one of the finest all-around fighters in the sport, breaking his opponents down with an uncommon blend of power, patience, poise and exquisite technique. When he finally took on Golovkin last year and was fortunate to come away with a split draw, \u00c1lvarez changed tactics dramatically in the rematch and went toe to toe in the centre of the ring with one of the sport\u2019s most feared punchers, relying on adaptability and resolve to earn a signature win in a classic encounter. Now squarely in the prime of a Hall of Fame career that has included world titles in three weight classes, the 28-year-old \u00c1lvarez is threatening to disrupt the financial model that has governed the sport for nearly five decades. There was nothing about Saturday\u2019s three-round destruction of the overmatched Fielding to dispel \u00c1lvarez\u2019s reputation as a child of privilege. In the end, the gratuitous display was little more than an eight-minute infomercial for DAZN, the upstart subscription streaming service that signed \u00c1lvarez to a five-year, 11-fight deal worth a minimum of $365m, a pact that\u2019s been touted breathlessly as the richest athlete contract in sports history. DAZN is gambling that \u00c1lvarez is big enough a draw to convince everyone who signed up for a free, one-month subscription for Saturday\u2019s fight to stay on for US$9.99 a month. But whether it will exist as a streaming service for boxing nerds or blossom into the Netflix of sports will depend almost entirely on whether DAZN can reach beyond the sport\u2019s core audience into the broader realm of casual fans. Which explains how \u00c1lvarez found himself making his New York debut on Saturday in a showcase fight against a hand-picked opponent that often felt more like a promotional appearance and brand-building exercise than a legitimate world-title contest. Fighting eastwards of Texas for only the second time ever \u2013 the first was a 2008 scrap at the Miccosukee Indian Gaming Resort on the western outskirts of Miami \u2013 \u00c1lvarez\u2019s objective was less Fielding\u2019s second-tier WBA title, which allowed promoters to dress up the affair as a meaningful bid for history, and more the expansion of his commercial footprint. Which is all fine if it means good fights are ahead. Until then, let\u2019s wait and see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
