Last year parents either living in or visiting the capital were entitled to discounts on the transport network off-peak evenings and at weekends. Two children and two adults could get a day's unlimited travel in central London for \u00a35.40. However, from the start of this year that same family is now paying closer to \u00a312 after Transport for London abolished the scheme. The news has been greeted with disbelief among families who live in the capital or visit it regularly, as it removed the financial incentive to leave the car at home at weekends. Ticket selling staff at some train stations had to put up signs saying \"it's not our fault - blame the London Mayor\". Transport for London's decision also appears to be at odds with congestion-reducing measures coming out of the mayor's sparkling HQ on London's south bank. Most parents with small children opt to use their cars at weekends rather than struggling up and down escalators with pushchairs. The old family travelcard gave them a good financial reason to do their bit for the environment and to let the train take the strain. Families on low incomes without a car will have no choice but to pay the higher charges. \"In spite of his reputation for being anti car, Mr Livingstone has effectively forced many of those people back into their cars,\" said one angry parent last weekend after being denied a family travelcard. \"In future I'll take the car which is OK for me, but what about everyone else? You have to feel sorry for foreign visitors paying these exorbitant prices to use our crappy trains,\" he said. Families who make occasional visits to the capital, already facing some of the highest hotel, theatre and other admission prices in the world, will be worst affected as they are unlikely to have an Oyster (pre-paid discount) card. A single journey on the tube in the central 'Zone 1' area now costs a staggering \u00a33 - a family of four could save money taking a black cab. Buses are cheaper at \u00a31.50 a ticket (free for children under 14), but the system can be difficult to navigate for those new to the capital. A spokesman for Transport for London says: \"The family travelcard was removed following a major rationalisation of our child fares. The travelcard accounted for around only 2% of ticket sales and was open to abuse by adults travelling without children. \"TfL is keen for families and young people to get out and about especially at weekends and evenings. On the Tube, child Oyster fares give great value, from as little as 50p per ride, with a maximum charge of \u00a31 for off-peak travel. One-day tickets, which are popular with visitors, have increased only marginally. For example, an off-peak one day adult travelcard in zones 1-2 costs \u00a34.90 in 2006, only 20p more than in 2005.\" The shift by TfL to get more Londoners using its pre-payment Oyster card means that it is now imperative to get one even if you are only an occasional visitor. Oyster cards can be bought online at tfl.gov.uk or at most tube and train stations and at some newsagents. Users have to put a minimum of \u00a33 on the card to get started - payment can be made by cash or credit cards - the deposit and balance is returnable, even if the card is lost. At the start of each journey, the user puts the card on a reader as they go through the barrier. They do the same at the other end - the system works out how much the journey costs and deducts that amount from the account. That said, the price of tickets bought this way do come down dramatically - single bus journeys cost 80p - off-peak, zone 1/2 travelcards cost \u00a34.40, compared to \u00a34.90 if bought with cash. Children aged 14-16 get free travel on the buses - but only if they have registered with Oyster. The problem for visitors is that each adult buying a ticket has to have their own card, and the discounts don't come close to those afforded by the old family travelcard. m.brignall@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
