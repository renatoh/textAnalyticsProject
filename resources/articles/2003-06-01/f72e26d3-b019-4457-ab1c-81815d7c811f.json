On Saturday we get the Telegraph and the Guardian. The Telegraph is really good on Saturday - I like the books pages, and it's just good to get a different point of view. Sunday, sometimes we get all of them. Well, not the News of the World, but mostly the Observer and the Independent on Sunday. Magazines: We always get The Week, that's very jolly. the New Statesman, Granta, Sight and Sound... We get the TLS and the LRB as and when. And the Royal Horticultural Magazine, The Garden, which is exciting. Well, it's not really exciting... If there are too many glossy magazines in the weekend papers after a while I start to feel sick. Books: Give me a break - I'm a Booker judge this year! I have to read 100 novels between March and August, so that means that recreation reading is now non-fiction. Short non-fiction. I'm reading Bernard Lewis' Arabs in History. TV: I don't watch as much as I used to as I watch DVDs. Also, because I do Front Row, I get sent preview copies, and the problem is, if you see the previews, then you have to wait for the rest of the series. State of Play for example, I watched the first three in a row, and now I'm having to wait for everyone to catch up. Radio: We've got one of those digital radios now and I get so excited! Inevitably I listen to Radio 4, and Radio 3. But you find yourself listening to all sorts of strange things - music stations on the whole. Adverts: I love those black horses - it must be Lloyds - galloping up to the cash machine. It is such a surreal image. My family loved that Jaffa Cake advert, where the teacher is showing the stages of the moon: \"Half moon, crescent moon, total eclipse!\" New Media: I use the internet a lot. BBCi is incredibly efficient. I like online galleries - it's amazing that you can disappear into a gallery in Sydney or Connecticut. \u00b7 Francine Stock is a writer and broadcaster.
