Citing concerns about \u201charsh winter conditions\u201d and the North Dakota Disaster Act of 1985, Dalrymple said on Monday that all persons at the camp are \u201cordered to leave the evacuation area immediately, and are further ordered not to return to the evacuation area\u201d. But Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota department of emergency services said, \u201cWe will not be using law enforcement or national guard to enforce the order.\u201d The 1985 law allows the governor to \u201cdirect and compel\u201d evacuations \u201cfrom any stricken or threatened area\u201d in the event of natural or manmade disasters. Dave Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribal council, called the executive order \u201ca menacing action meant to cause fear\u201d and \u201ca blatant attempt by the state and local officials to usurp and circumvent federal authority\u201d. \u201cThis is a clear stretch of state emergency management authority and a further attempt to abuse and humiliate the water protectors,\u201d he said in a statement. Thousands of Native American and environmental activists have gathered at the encampment, which is on Army Corps land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and close to the site where the Dakota Access pipeline is slated to cross under the Missouri river. On Friday, the Army Corps wrote to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, ordering the closure of camps on its land, north of the Cannonball river. That announcement raised fears that law enforcement officials would attempt to forcibly evict the camps, but on Sunday, the Corps clarified that it had \u201cno plans for forcible removal\u201d. As part of his order, the governor said, the state will not guarantee the provision of emergency services in the \u201cevacuation area\u201d. \u201cThe general public is hereby notified that emergency services probably will not be available under current winter conditions,\u201d he wrote. Michael Knudsen, logistics coordinator for the Standing Rock Medic &amp; Healer Council, which has provided care and services at the camps, said the announcement showed that the governor \u201chas absolutely no empathy or care for the lives of the campers\u201d. \u201cThis is completely morally reprehensible,\u201d he said, adding that the council was prepared to continue addressing medical needs at the camps without the help of the North Dakota government. \u201cWe have never counted on the state\u2019s help, because we know that ultimately the state health department is controlled by the power of the governor who has proven time and time again he does not want this encampment and therefore does not care about the wellbeing of the people.\u201d LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a Standing Rock Sioux tribe member and founder of the Sacred Stone camp, said that the governor did not have authority over the land and that the water protectors would not evacuate. \u201cWe are not leaving. We are standing. Ask every grandma who is standing out there,\u201d said Allard, who owns land where some of the activists have been camped for months. Allard drew parallels to the long history of colonizers forcing indigenous people off of their lands. \u201cThis time we are standing. This is taken land. We have a right to be there.\u201d She also scoffed at claims that the government was prioritizing public safety and the health of people camped at Standing Rock. \u201cWinter is a normal thing for us. The people are prepared and ready,\u201d she said, noting that police recently deployed water cannons against nonviolent demonstrators. \u201cThey poured water over people when it was freezing.\u201d Allard said the announcement was an obvious ploy to help support the pipeline corporation, which has said that delays in construction have cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cThey are running out of time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
