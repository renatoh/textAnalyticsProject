The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio star will fly out to the American capital tomorrow where he will link up with fellow Geordie Ray Hudson, coach of DC United. Gascoigne had been linked with the club after his short-term contract with First Division Burnley came to an end. Gascoigne, who joined the Clarets from Everton during last season, will stay in Washington for a week and watch the team play on Saturday and take part in training on Monday and Tuesday of next week before making up his mind over a move the following day. Gascoigne's agent Ian Elliott told Radio Five Live the player was excited about the trip. \"He's always wanted to play in America,\" said Elliott. Former Sheffield Wednesday player John Harkes has assured Elliott of DC United's standing. \"I've spoken to John Harkes and he speaks very highly of Washington,\" added Elliott."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
