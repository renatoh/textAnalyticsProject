Time to cut each other some slack", "bodyText": "Before we went into lockdown, I was trying to persuade my mother to reduce her contact circle to five. It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren\u2019t on the list, and she said: \u201cGood heavens, I\u2019m not going to tell them. That would be so rude!\u201d Then the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox. I asked what was the point of fixing her letterbox, when the only important letter she was going to get would be from the government, telling her not to have anyone round, irrespective of whether or not she had a defective letterbox. She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, graciously. \u201cI\u201dm not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,\u201d I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically. My friend\u2019s mum got a guy round to fix her cutlery drawer, which has been broken for two years. My sister\u2019s neighbour, supposedly in full cocoon, still goes to the shop every day and, when she said she would go for him, he said: \u201cI\u2019m just in and out. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking anyone to dance.\u201d Another cocoon-candidate in my life goes out before dawn every morning just to smell the sea, like the bloody French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman. My uncle spent the night before the pubs closed in a Wetherspoon\u2019s, which I disapprove of in 17 different ways. It is very annoying trying to get the people who should take this the most seriously to take it seriously at all. But it\u2019s also sort of a duff judgment to make, because when you have a life-limiting condition, and even before this happened, you already felt like \u2013 in my mother\u2019s words \u2013 a hot-air balloon with a terminal puncture, waiting to hit the ground, it is highly debatable and a completely personal matter whether you want to spend 12 of what is a finite number of weeks completely on your own. Not everyone over 70 is in the same situation. For some, that \u201cunderlying health condition\u201d means they wouldn\u2019t even be admitted to hospital, nor want to be. It simply isn\u2019t possible to adjudicate across the piece, from a distance, as if the elderly were one homogeneous mass. Yet we are all trying to build new rules, at speed, and the easiest way to do so is to constantly, volubly judge each other. Since the sun came out, it has been like a new season of censoriousness. In any normal year, the spaghetti straps would appear and society\u2019s sap would start to rise. This year, it\u2019s a super-charged indignation. Families are furious with joggers, cyclists are furious with bipeds, everyone hates dog walkers, except anyone with a dog, who is wondering why dogless people have to be out at all. The usual great sunbather debate \u2013 regular human beings getting vitamin D, or spawn of Satan? (somebody get The Moral Maze on the case) \u2013 was less interesting to me than my own bugbear, people with huge gardens and/ or no clue what it\u2019s like to live with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, waxing judgmental about why everyone couldn\u2019t do the responsible thing and remain totally indoors, open a window if they felt so stir crazy. But I got my own comeuppance with that, when I launched full tilt into a fight on Twitter with one of the \u201cjust stay indoors\u201d brigade, only to find that she was quarantined away from her own children, and had been for weeks, because she worked in a hospital. So yes, I was categorically the arsehole. All bets are off, and there are no shortcuts: you cannot possibly guess why that person is behaving the way they are, or saying the things they do. You can\u2019t know what pressures they are under, or whether it was the same or better or worse yesterday. You can\u2019t know what they think about their own mortality, or why. You can\u2019t even know for sure what bubbling tensions are driving your own reactions, until you wake up at 5am, dreaming about Harriet Harman trying to save a sinking island through the medium of dance, and realise it\u2019s possible you are more anxious than you thought. There is really no alternative but to put our own finger-pointing on ice, or under lockdown, if you prefer. My mother, incidentally, was right and there appears to be an unlimited number of people who wish they were on her list-of-zero. Someone left a bottle of ros\u00e9 on her doorstep the other day, and she was worrying that she didn\u2019t know who to thank. I said: \u201cPut a giant sign on your door, saying, \u2018Thanks for the ros\u00e9.\u2019 That way, the person will feel thanked, and the whole street will know that you appreciate ros\u00e9.\u201d I might be insensitive but I am also a stone cold genius. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
