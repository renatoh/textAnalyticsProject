The event is the biggest and traditionally the only major commemoration of the incident allowed in China. Taiwan also marked the massacre with a vigil and exhibition on \u201cTank man\u201d \u2013 the man photographed standing in front of tanks on 5 June 1989. On the mainland, all talk of the Chinese army\u2019s killing of thousands of peaceful student protesters is forbidden. But Hong Kong has had a level of independence under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule enacted after Britain relinquished control to China in 1997. On Tuesday evening, crowds filled the six football pitches of Victoria Park, suggesting the number of attendees could break the 2012 record of 180,000. The streets leading to the park were lined with pro-democracy stalls and demonstrators handing out posters and flyers. Audrey Eu, a former legislator and a founder of the Civic party, handed out flyers as young members addressed the crowd. \u201cEven though they\u2019re not yet 30 years old, they\u2019re so passionate about it,\u201d she said. Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran activist and former legislator, stood on a stepladder at the entrance, thanking and shaking the hands of those who walked in. \u201cAfter 30 years, there is still so many candlelight vigils \u2026 and so many people come out to fight for their rights, you feel hopeful. How can you give up when others won\u2019t give up?\u201d Lee told the Guardian last week. \u201cThe whole of China is silenced, and we have a window, or a loudspeaker for that in Hong Kong, to tell the world what happened.\u201d Lee was a young labour organiser in 1989, sent to the student protests in Tiananmen Square with funds activists had raised in Hong Kong. \u201cI heard the gunshots and saw the tanks rolling in, the rickshaws taking injured people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went from high hope to despair for me.\u201d Lee was detained and forced to apologise before being allowed to return to Hong Kong, where he now runs the June 4th Museum. He says many visitors are mainlanders, and the museum has been targeted by harassment and vandalism. \u201cWhen I came back from Beijing 20 years ago, people told me to make sure you tell the world the truth,\u201d he said. As night fell in Hong Kong, thousands of candles flickered. People cried as the crowd joined in songs, before chanting slogans and the date of the incident. Footage of the massacre was broadcast on a giant screen and some turned away as the recorded sound of Chinese guns rang out. The crowd broke its silence to yell at an image of the then Chinese leader, Li Peng. Jimmy So, 60, and Chung King Wah, 70, said they had attended all 30 vigils since the massacre. \u201cWe want the Chinese Communist party to recognise the mistake of the June 4 crackdown and massacre, and we will come here every year until they do,\u201d So said. Members of the standing committee of the Hong Kong Alliance laid a wreath and lit a flame of remembrance, and key members of the movement addressed the crowd in Cantonese, including the vice-chair, Chow Hang Tung, and representatives of the Tiananmen Mothers group. Lau Ka-yee, a core member of the group who is based in Hong Kong, said she could not visit China because of her activism, and none of the mothers had been able to attend the vigil. \u201cThey even can\u2019t go out of their home in Beijing. Some time about May or June they have to leave Beijing to their home village,\u201d she said. A proposed Hong Kong bill to allow the transfer of fugitives to mainland China, which many fear will be the end of Hong Kong as a safe haven, was a constant theme at the vigil. There are widespread fears the new law could be used to target political dissidents and attending the vigil may soon become too dangerous. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator, said: \u201cIt may sound exaggerated to outsiders, but if you look at China and how it practises its rule of law, if there is such a thing, it\u2019s anything goes.\u201d Beijing launched a crackdown before the anniversary, detaining key activists or sending them on enforced \u201cvacations\u201d. Hong Kong immigration officials also assisted, deporting on arrival an exiled dissident and a former Peking University student, Feng Congde, on Sunday evening. Regina Ip, a legislator, said she believed it was because Congde had intended to go to the vigil. \u201cHong Kong allows our people to hold the annual June 4 candlelight vigils. They have a right to express their views, to remember whatever happened 30 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have to allow high-profile dissidents to come in and stir up further emotions. What\u2019s the point?\u201d Lee said Ip\u2019s comments were ridiculous. \u201cWe can already stir up the emotion. It\u2019s already there,\u201d he said.
