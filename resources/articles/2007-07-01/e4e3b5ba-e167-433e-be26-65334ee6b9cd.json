The ECB judged that the flooding of the Severn over the New Road ground represented \"exceptional circumstances\" and sought to appease Kent's protests that the match should have been relocated from Worcester, in the knowledge that the ground would never be fit. It has instructed that the match should be rescheduled between July 30 and August 3. That has brought howls of outrage from rival counties, who have also had to contend with the disruption caused by the wettest summer for years. Yorkshire's Roses match against Lancashire this week was wrecked by bad weather and the first day of their top-of-the-table clash with Warwickshire was washed out yesterday. Stewart Regan, Yorkshire's chief executive, said last night: \"We have made a submission to the ECB, on behalf of 10 first-class counties, appealing against the decision. Two other counties have expressed their opposition independently. This decision challenges the integrity of the competition and could affect the outcome of the championship and relegation. We are convinced that the ECB must reconsider.\" The seven First Division counties, aside from Kent and Worcestershire, the bottom club, are named on the submission. Five of the nine Second Division clubs - two independently - have also protested. The board does have delegated powers to act on behalf of the counties but it is also obliged to take note of the opinions of interested parties. The ECB, perhaps naively, concluded that the only interested parties were Worcestershire and Kent, seemingly oblivious to the fact that any replay would affect the table for every First Division county. England and Scotland have agreed to play an inaugural one-day international next summer. Cricket Scotland and the ECB have provisional plans for the fixture at either Titwood in Glasgow or The Grange in Edinburgh on August 18. A subsequent match in 2012 will be dependent on Scotland retaining ODI status. As part of an agreement the Scottish Saltires and the Scotland A team will continue to participate in the domestic structure in England and Wales. Roddy Smith, the Cricket Scotland chief executive, said: \"The ECB have been strong supporters of ours for a number of years, and it was a logical step to see a formal agreement moving forward. Having the England side in Scotland for an ODI next year will give the game a huge boost.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
