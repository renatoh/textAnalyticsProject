They want the loss of their loved ones to be a catalyst for positive change. Yet we are still awaiting meaningful action from the government as to how it will ensure tenants in social housing are listened to, and how it will genuinely strengthen the regulation of their landlords. Theresa May\u2019s speech at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference (Opinion, 27 June) spoke of a stronger consumer regulation regime, but we need more than this. If the 9 million social tenants in England are to feel safe in their homes, and assured they\u2019ll receive the standard of service to which they\u2019re entitled, we need a tough new regulator to enforce consumer housing standards. Governments have responded to protect consumers in this way before, creating the Food Standards Agency after a series of high-profile food deaths, and the Financial Conduct Authority following financial scandals. Why should social tenants matter less? Tenants need to know that their wellbeing, health and safety will be protected, and standards rigorously enforced, by a regulator focused on working for them. We call on the government to show social tenants that they matter and will no longer be ignored. When next steps for social housing are announced later this year, the government must go further than their initial proposals. We expect nothing less than a new consumer regulator.
