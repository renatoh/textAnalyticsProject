It was noxious and exploitative but also horribly compelling, a greedily consumed guilt watch that went down easily but left us feeling uneasy on reflection. The parent-baiting tale of a teen taking her own life stoked anger after its premiere due to both its bleak inevitability and its graphic, gothic romanticism. A debate grew over its potentially harmful impact on its young target audience, one that\u2019s been recently reignited by two studies suggesting a possible correlation between its release and a significant spike in real-world suicides. There\u2019s then something rather daring, perhaps even dangerous, about the idea of Euphoria, HBO\u2019s splashy, explicit high school drama premiering in the midst of this ongoing furore. It\u2019s a show that deals with addiction, sexuality, porn, body-shaming, drugs, sexual assault, toxic masculinity, self-harm and pretty much every other One Million Moms-angering issue you can think of \u2026 and that\u2019s just in the four episodes available to critics. But, while bracingly frank, it\u2019s also able to balance any shock appeal with surprising sensitivity. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, making a show about teens that feels both unfiltered yet careful but somehow, Assassination Nation writer-director Sam Levinson has crafted something that succeeds in every way 13 Reasons Why failed. It\u2019s still probably going to piss parents off (there are more dicks in the first few episodes than I could count) but there\u2019s more on its mind than simply courting controversy. While something of an ensemble piece, Euphoria\u2019s main focus is the post-rehab journey of Rue (Zendaya), an anxiety-ridden 17-year-old returning to school with a dark cloud hovering over her head. It\u2019s not one that she\u2019s comfortable stepping away from just yet, choosing to continue abusing while pretending to her fraught mother that she\u2019s getting better. Her life intersects with a distinctive subsection of peers, from swaggering sociopathic jock Nate (The Kissing Booth\u2019s Jacob Elordi) to sexually unsure college freshman Chris (The Hate U Give\u2019s Algee Smith) to body-conscious Kat (model Barbie Ferreira) to, most notably, new girl Jules (trans activist Hunter Schafer). Rue finds herself captivated by Jules and the two begin an intense friendship, but one that might struggle to weather the storm that\u2019s about to engulf them all. Aside from its buzzy cast of up-and-comers, headlined by Disney star done good Zendaya, Euphoria has its cool points stocked up behind the camera, too, with boutique indie studio A24 and executive producer Drake to give it at least a superficial air of authenticity. The show boasts a dizzying aesthetic that some could conceivably criticise as over-stylised but I found it intoxicating, not only because it\u2019s so refreshing to watch a cinematic, directed show after enduring so many flat Netflix series but because there\u2019s substance in the script to support the visual indulgence. There\u2019s specificity in the problems faced by the teens, whether it\u2019s how pornography has mutated the idea of real-world sex or how to rationalise depressive thoughts when you\u2019re fully aware of your own privilege, and each episode available entered new, enticingly uncharted territory. While it might boast a heady sheen, it\u2019s far from a glossy look at high school life, comfortably existing in an entirely different dimension to a show like Riverdale. It\u2019s often incredibly bleak in its portrayal of addiction and in trying to construct the overwhelming social assault teens face day-to-day, whether it be from online bullying or from the unending influx of contrasting media messages. Rue\u2019s road to addiction is explained through a difficult mosaic of grief, mental health and being born into a world suffocating in stress. One of the show\u2019s biggest challenges is not glamorising the scenes of a Vogue cover star taking so many drugs and while the scenes of Rue snorting and drinking are stylishly shot, the script never shies away from the devastating impact of her decisions at every turn. She\u2019s an awkward deadbeat, far from a character to aspire to and, in her most substantial role to date, Zendaya is admirably understated. Her performance is one of many great turns in a show populated by relative unknowns who each prove captivating in varying ways. There are still camera-friendly faces but the casting feels closer to capturing what an actual high school looks like and similarly, Levinson also manages to deal with sexuality and gender with unusually grounded nuance. It\u2019s not announced or made obvious but there\u2019s a casual fluidity that\u2019s both the product of a generation and also a deft storyteller. With Drake on board, there\u2019s an expectedly keen awareness of music with the soundtrack veering from Andy Williams to Beyonc\u00e9 to Bobby Womack to Jorja Smith, often reaching hair-raising moments of transcendence. There\u2019s a wildness that sees the show imagining everything from a Game of Thrones-inspired high school massacre to an animated fan fiction sex scene between Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, impossible to predict from scene to scene. At times it risks descending into excess and sometimes, Rue\u2019s narration can seem overwritten in a Fight Club-lite kind of way but the pace is so fast that the show is soon on to something that lands far better. Euphoria is an extreme experience, dialled up all the way to 11, that could prove nightmarish for parents while also making the rest of us feel pretty relieved not to be in high school any more. Its louder moments are graphic and brash but its quieter moments are equally impactful, a well-modulated drama that knows when to push and then pull back. It\u2019s hard to know where it will go and that\u2019s part of its untamed appeal but as it stands, it\u2019s one of the most audacious and effective new shows I have seen this year. Euphoria starts in the US on HBO on 16 June with a UK date to follow"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
