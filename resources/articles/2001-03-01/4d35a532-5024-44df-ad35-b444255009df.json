But he had to go. And no Prime Minister with an instinct for self-preservation will ever bring him back. Technically his crime was nothing like as serious as David Willetts's attempt to deceive a House of Commons select committee. And Willetts is now back on the Tory front bench and about to draft the Conservative election manifesto. But he was found guilty only once. Mandelson has been in a succession of scrapes, and, innocent or not, the pattern of his conduct had become intolerable. He enjoyed living dangerously, and fell off the high wire far too often. Although Mandelson was acquitted of all charges, the report exposes a Whitehall machine which is complacent, incompetent and (in a very gentlemanly fashion) institutionally corrupt. The indictment is not that Ministers and civil servants treated the Hindujas in an exceptional way, nor that they helped them by breaking the rules. The report reveals that the rules which are regularly applied - when compounded by a demeaning reverence for wealth - are a disgrace. Among the working-class black and Asian British, the Home Office is notorious for the unsympathetic way in which it treats run-of-the-mill nationality applications. Yet in 1998 Ministers and civil servants competed with each other to give Strichand Hinduja a swift and easy passage. Shameful, but neither improper nor illegal. It is possible to relax some of the basic citizenship requirements 'in the special circumstances of any particular case'. So Andrew Walmsley, head of the Nationality Directorate, suggested that Rule D - which requires 450 days' residence in the UK during the five years before application - might be waived. Hinduja had been paying British taxes. There is no doubt why Hinduja was treated with such deference. In his note to Ministers, Walmsley emphasised a special attribute which he regarded as worthy of 'consideration' when the application for citizenship was considered: 'The family business empire has a corporate wealth of $6-$8 billion and their personal wealth was estimated in 1991 at \u00a3500m.' That wide-eyed description of the brothers' fortune solves the whole Hinduja riddle. It explains why William Hague was photographed with him, Tony Blair accepted invitations to his parties and Peter Mandelson acted as his messenger boy. Sadly, New Labour, no less than the Tories, is hypnotised by big bank balances. Wealth is regarded as synonymous with virtue and success. The mafia of power and money binds Ministers to men who should not be allowed within a mile of No 10. And the money buys privilege. The Hammond Report is explicit about that. Most people who know how Whitehall works will believe that the Mandelson phone call, whatever its formal purpose, guaranteed Hinduja special consideration. But the evidence proves that he was getting it already. As head of the Nationality Directorate, Walmsley 'tended to deal with high-profile cases himself'. And, partly because of his rank and partly because of his lighter case load, his applications progressed more quickly than those processed by his staff. Ergo, high visibility guaranteed speedy attention. So much for equality before the law. Walmsley has moved on. We should be grateful for that. He was not sure of the exact number of days Strichand Hinduja had spent in the country immediately before his nationality application, and he did not require him to apply again after his first attempt had failed. References, he said, were useless since they were usually complimentary. Not all of them. Caroline Elmes of the Foreign Office wrote to say that: 'At the very least, the Hinduja brothers can be said to sail close to the wind.' When he reported to Ministers, Walmsley put it differently. 'At the time of his earlier application there were doubts about the brothers' ability to meet the requirements to be of good character... These were, however, resolved concerning Mr Gopichand Hinduja's application and there is no reason to believe that Mr Strichand Hinduja would not now meet the requirement.' Tell that to the Indian government which will not let him out of the country. The problem, as so often, is the whole culture. Money talks. My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given. It is hard for him to make the Home Office change its ways with so much rich men's money swilling about Labour. New Labour is right to denounce old-fashioned socialism's antagonism to success. But success is not a virtue. The least we can accept is that, after the election, the Labour will show some discretion in its choice of millionaires. The Hammond Report proves - almost absentmindedly - the danger of being dazzled by wealth.
