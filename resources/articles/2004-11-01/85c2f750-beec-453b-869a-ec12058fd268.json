American saxophonist Sam Rivers, now 81, had to fight for space on a radical American modern-jazz scene of the late 1950s and 60s that saw some of the most innovative work of Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. Rivers left Miles Davis in 1964 because he thought the music was too unadventurous, joined such uncompromising experimenters as Cecil Taylor and Andrew Hill, and had a long and productive partnership with expat British bassist Dave Holland. On this gig, at the end of a UK tour, Rivers showcases both his improvising skills in the intimate setting of a trio, and his eccentrically swinging composing side with a powerful British-based orchestra. (JF) Cecil Taylor/Bill Dixon/Tony Oxley Trio/Anthony Braxton Quintet Royal Festival Hall, South Bank (020-7960 4242), Monday November 15. Cecil Taylor, the 75-year-old improvising piano revolutionary from New York, is liable to twitch on his seat as if it's an electric chair. His restless and densely packed music has accompanied modern dance (with Mikhail Baryshnikov) and constantly suggests impulsive movement. Taylor appears here in a trio with the veteran trumpet radical Bill Dixon, and British percussionist Tony Oxley, a brilliant complementer of Taylor's tumultuous method. The other half of the show features the prolific multi-sax virtuoso Anthony Braxton, who embraces almost every jazz resource, from swing to noise. (JF) Brad Mehldau Wigmore Hall, 36 Wigmore Street (020-7935 2141), Wednesday/ Thursday November 17/18. Brad Mehldau divides jazz listeners between those who think he represents dangerous flirtations with a classically pure, chamber-recitalist's notion of jazz, and those who believe he might be the most fascinating pianist in any genre on the planet today. Mehldau is undoubtedly unique - but the lineage of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett is in evidence. He moves easily between European classical and African-American musical inflections and phrasing. Mehldau plays solo on the first of these gigs, and with his regular trio on the second. (JF) Ganelin/Tarasov/Chekasin Trio Purcell Room, South Bank (020-7960 4242) Sunday November 14. In the early 80s, when KGB agents shadowed Soviet artists performing abroad, pianist Vyacheslav Ganelin's trio woke the western world up to radical Russian jazz on a UK tour with sax partner Vladimir Chekasin and free-drummer Vladimir Tarasov. The music was like cop-show themes spliced with silent-movie scores, post-Ornette Coleman jazz and tongue-in-cheek swing. This groundbreaking group broke up, and its reassembly for these London gigs is a historic affair. (JF) Carla Bley/The Lost Chords Queen Elizabeth Hall (020-7960 4242), Friday November 19. The Lost Chords is the name of a suite-like collection of pieces and this band features Bley on piano, Andy Sheppard on saxes, Steve Swallow on bass and Billy Drummond on percussion. Bley is as whimsically ingenious as ever, even if the materials might sound contriveduntil you hear the way the group manipulates them. There are some Thelonious Monk echoes at times, and the adaptable Andy Sheppard neatly complements Bley's relaxed eclecticism in seamless shifts from cool funk to hard swing to outer-reaches circular-breathing virtuosity. The group often echoes both Thelonious Monk's quartet recordings and occasionally the 1960s Stan Tracey group with Bobby Wellins. (JF) Future Sounds of Jazz. Vijay Iyer &amp; Mike Ladd Royal Festival Hall, South Bank (020-7960 4242), Friday November 12 . When an earlier version of this line-up toured the UK in the spring, the venues were packed with young fans absorbing everything from free improvisation through post-Miles funk and complex composition to soulful songs and raps. High-profile participants include Ty, Soweto Kinch (see page 25), Matthew Bourne, bassist Tom Herbert and drummers Leo Taylor and Tom Skinner. In What Language, by pianist Iyer and rapper Ladd, is a response to the humiliation of Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, who was chained to a bench at New York's JFK airport after he refused to be fingerprinted. A stunning double bill. (JLW) Vocal Sampling Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank (020-7960 4242), Tuesday November 16. You might have thought the jazz festival's vocal quota was entirely taken up by young and beautiful jazz singers such as Gwyneth Herbert (12 November), Peter Cincotti (16 November), Silje Nergaard (20 &amp; 21 November) and the brilliant Lizz Wright (20 November). Or World Music stars like Mory Kante (17 November) and Marta Sebestyen (20 November). But the six singers of Vocal Sampling are something else. With just mouths and microphones, they recreate the instrumental sounds of Latin music, and their a cappella singing is thrilling. (JLW) Graham Collier: The Celebration Band Purcell Room, South Bank (020-7960 4242), Wednesday November 17. Jazz composer Collier, now resident in Spain, is routinely celebrated as a pioneer, educator and talent-spotter - his 1960s and 70s bands brought out the best of the new generation and he helped launch Loose Tubes in the 1980s. But he's always had a gift for effective improvising structures and simple melodies, as Brit-jazz hits like Rolli's Tune and Crumblin' Cookie attest. Collier regards his musicians \"as a group of soloists as well as a group of texture makers\"; the Celebration Band's sound palette includes tuba king Andy Grappy , trumpeter Harry Beckett and legendary guitarist Ed Speight. (JLW) Babel All-dayer RFH PizzaExpress Free stage Free admission. Sunday November 2. Something for everyone in this marathon tribute to Ollie Weindling's Babel label, including people who don't like paying for tickets, with the (all-female) Vortex Foundation Big Band, brilliant pianist Huw Warren, Partisans, Christine Tobin, the excellent Irish singer-writer (see page 25), thoughtful guitarist Billy Jenkins and some wild jazz-poetry with ex-Crass sage and wordsmith Penny Rimbaud. There's plenty more jazz for free throughout the festival. (JLW) Xploding Plastix The Spitz, 109 Commercial St E1 (020-7247 9747) Sunday November 21. You could stick with the Spitz throughout the festival and still hear a fantastic variety: Polar Bear (13 November), Homemade Orchestra (16 November), Screaming Headless Torsos (17 November), Acoustic Ladyland (12 November), all stretching the boundaries. But the act that goes that all-important extra mile is Xploding Plastix. The Norwegian duo make jazzy mincemeat of their enormous collection of samples. Pretty extreme, but with lashings of style.
