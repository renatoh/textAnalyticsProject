Universal basic income, or UBI, has sparked the attention of people ranging from Silicon Valley to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party, as a way of guaranteeing workers a minimum income and ensuring they are not left behind by automation. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has promised to examine the idea, which would replace means-tested benefits with a single payment to every adult. But in an extract from his forthcoming book, Square Deal, Boles \u2013 the MP for Grantham and a former skills minister \u2013 said Conservatives should have \u201cmoral\u201d objections to UBI. \u201cThe main objection to the idea of a universal basic income is not practical but moral,\u201d he writes. \u201cIts enthusiasts suggest that when intelligent machines make most of us redundant, we will all dispense with the idea of earning a living and find true fulfilment in writing poetry, playing music and nurturing plants. That is dangerous nonsense. \u201cMankind is hard-wired to work. We gain satisfaction from it. It gives us a sense of identity, purpose and belonging \u2026 we should not be trying to create a world in which most people do not feel the need to work.\u201d Boles also argues the idea would also be prohibitively expensive. \u201cCurrently, the government is able to target help on those who need it most and can therefore afford to be modestly generous. If, in future, everyone were to receive the same basic income, the poorest would suffer a big drop in their income while average earners\u2019 taxes would go up.\u201d Boles is widely viewed by his colleagues as one of the more thoughtful backbenchers in a party hungry for a convincing riposte to Corbyn\u2019s radical socialism. Rather than seeking to compensate workers for losing their roles in a more automated economy, he argues that the government should invest heavily in equipping them with the new skills they will need \u2013 including the creation of new two-year technical qualifications. His intervention comes after the IPPR thinktank warned that up to 44% of jobs in the UK economy could potentially be open to automation in the coming decades, with lower-paid workers the most likely to be displaced. Corbyn used his party conference speech in September to suggest a Labour government would use the tax system to ensure that the benefits of automation are widely shared across the economy: an idea quickly dubbed the \u201crobot tax\u201d. But Boles warned that taxing firms that benefit from automation would simply discourage them from investing. \u201cThe only sure result of a robot tax would be lower investment, lower productivity and lower wages.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
