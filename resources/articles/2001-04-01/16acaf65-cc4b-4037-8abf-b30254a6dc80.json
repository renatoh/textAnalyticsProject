Buy into the average high-income unit trust and you will be lucky to get more than 3.5 per cent. But buy shares in some of Britain's largest companies and you could get a yield of 7.5 per cent on your investment. As interest rates fall, those looking for income are being forced to look for alternative places to put their money. Corporate-bond funds are one possibility, but the highest-paying funds in this category tend to be high risk. There are split-capital investment trusts, where one type of share takes the capital growth and another takes the income, but the turbulence in the market has increased the risk in the portfolios underlying these shares. Direct investment in some of the high-yielding shares in the stock market is, therefore, a sensible alternative. There are, of course, risks with such a strategy. There is usually a reason for a com pany having a high yield, calculated by showing the dividend as a percentage of the share price. It may be that the market expects the dividend to be cut, in which case the yield is far less generous than it seems. Or it may be that there is little prospect of growth in the dividend, as is the case with the utilities. If you buy a selection of high-yield stocks, you do reduce the risk. Look at the performance of the Dogs of the FTSE 100, the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the index. These have held level, in aggregate, for the past five months, compared with a 6 per cent fall in the index itself. Companies with generous dividend policies tend to be in defensive industries such as water, electricity, tobacco and retailing. Their profits may be resilient to recession; we eat, light our homes and smoke regardless of what the economy is doing, but they are unlikely to grow much. If you are looking to the stock market for income, be selective. Some you may like to consider are: tobacco stocks Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco, offering 5.5 per cent as compensation for the risk of litigation; utilities Scottish and Southern Energy or Scottish Power, paying 4.7 per cent and 6.6 per cent respectively, though price regulation means that may not rise much; and Lloyds TSB, so out of favour that it is offering a generous 4.3 per cent and rising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
