Tommy Seymour 6 Always looked dangerous and made some telling breaks in the first half but worryingly had to be helped off after 64 minutes. Huw Jones 7 Two tries against England last year and his early score here rocked England on their heels. His second brought the house down Pete Horne 6 He spurned a two-man overlap that could have given Scotland a second-half try but is forging an excellent partnership with Jones. Sean Maitland 7 The Saracens wing took his try well with an outstanding finish and kept the dangerous Anthony Watson under wraps. Excellent. Finn Russell 8 No player on the pitch was under more scrutiny and he responded brilliantly. Kicked well and turned England\u2019s defence inside out. Greig Laidlaw 7 Restored to the starting lineup against France and has now cemented his place. Replaced by Price in the final quarter. Gordon Reid 7 The London Irish man held his own against Dan Cole and no one would know there was a Scottish front-row crisis. Stuart McInally 7 The hooker made important tackles in his best display in a Scottish shirt. Was accurate in the lineout and strong in the scrum. Simon Berghan 6 The New Zealand-born tighthead is Scotland\u2019s heaviest forward and he made it count. Made some crunching tackles. Grant Gilchrist 7 Scotland\u2019s best ball-carrier against France was strong again although his discipline let him down. Everywhere in the first half. Jonny Gray 7 The lock put painful memories of Twickenham last year behind him and was Scotland\u2019s most prolific tackler. Good lineout work. John Barclay (capt) 7 He did some outstanding work at the breakdown and was particularly impressive in the first half. Good, abrasive display. Hamish Watson 7 Built for speed and should have used that pace to score a try but Horne\u2019s pass was wayward. Always a thorn in England\u2019s side. Ryan Wilson 7 Nasty incident when he appeared to run his fingernails down Hughes\u2019s face, but Wilson refused to bow to the heftier No 8. REPLACEMENTS Jamie Bhatti (for Reid 55) 6; WP Nel (for Berghan 68) Made a big impact in the scrum 7; Tim Swinson (for Gilchrist 55) 6; David Denton (for Wilson 68) 6; Ali Price (for Laidlaw 62) Added some extra tempo in the last quarter 6; Nick Grigg (for Horne 72) 6; Blair Kinghorn (for Seymour 64) 6 England Mike Brown 5 The full-back had been outstanding against Wales but was stuck doing defensive duties on a miserable night. Anthony Watson 5 He and Brown were at fault for Jones\u2019s second try. Almost wriggled though for a late try and made some big tackles. Jonathan Joseph 6 The hammer of the Scots last year but not this time. He was mostly restricted to defensive duties and half-breaks. Owen Farrell 6 England\u2019s best player against Wales and his try hauled them back into the game; was unlucky to see a second turned down. Jonny May 5 He had few chances to repeat his try-scoring feats against Wales. The wing made some decent runs but faded after the break. George Ford 5 Had the odd experience of being eclipsed by his opposite number and playing behind a beaten pack before being replaced. Danny Care 6 He had a decent night under pressure from the Scotland back row. Kicked well but unable to attack around the fringes. Mako Vunipola 5 Those scrummaging sessions against the Georgian pack paid off but he was not at his best in open play. Looked weary. Dylan Hartley (capt) 5 England\u2019s captain became his country\u2019s second most-capped player. But question marks will be against his place in the side. Dan Cole 6 He was his usual powerful self at scrums and made some important tackles but unable to impose himself on the game. Joe Launchbury 7 Not the way to mark your 50th cap, but he had a decent game in the engine-room and was influential in the lineout. Maro Itoje 6 Not at his best in this tournament by his standards. Had a solid game in the lineout and made some good carries. Courtney Lawes 6 He tackled well and will be disappointed that his thumping hit on Barclay did not give Farrell his second try. Chris Robshaw 6 Made his mark at the breakdown early on and forced to play at No 8 for much of the second half. Worked tirelessly, as always. Nathan Hughes 6 Rushed back to fitness for his ball-carrying power. He was England\u2019s best forward before his withdrawal after the break. REPLACEMENTS Jamie George (for Hartley 55) 6; Joe Marler (for Vunipola 68) 6; Harry Williams (for Cole 64) 6; George Kruis (for Launchbury 71) 6; Sam Underhill (for Hughes 53) Made an impact but also got yellow card 5; Richard Wigglesworth (for Care 71) 6; Ben Te\u2019o (for Ford 64) 6; Jack Nowell (for Brown 55) 6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
