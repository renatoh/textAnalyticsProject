It's essentially a bright light suspended over a box, into which moths fall and then pass the evening, until I can liberate them the following day. Intermittently I have to perform a task that is one half guilty horror, the other half wonder and astonishment. The screw-in socket to the bulb gradually fills with a residue of dead insects - not moths, but flies and minuscule beetles - and I'm obliged to clean it out. On to a piece of white paper I gently shake out the collateral damage of moth trapping: the unsuspecting, blameless creatures which, lured to the bulb, are incinerated by its surplus heat. I'm suddenly confronted with scores of tiny but perfectly preserved and unknown neighbours, whose futile passing I cannot even memorialise with a name. One fly nestled in my spread of corpses shines like glass and is the colour of a peacock's eye. Through a hand lens I am confronted by an array of detail: complex mouth parts, intricately segmented legs, abdomens bristling with fine hairs. Yet all this information doesn't serve as a revelation. In a way, it deepens the sense of mystery and confusion. What does it all mean? The lives and individual deaths of these tiny insects probably surround us at every step we take, and we never notice. In fact one slightly heavier breath and my meditation ends as all this invertebrate mystery is puffed away. These tiny creatures are part of the very fabric of our parish life. In transmuted form they are the summer-long song of birds, they are the fish in the dykes, the otter I saw this summer and the vixen thrumming over the dusk fields. They are the adult dragonfly I saw yesterday evening, glistening somehow through the shadow down the track."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
