The series, which exists along the same lines as Seven Up, took 25 British babies, born at the start of the new millennium, and followed them over several years. Archive footage from the very beginning shows experts suggesting that we were looking at \u201ca better society, a better world for our children\u201d. That was 20 years ago. In a series of rapid-fire news compilations, we see that a lot has happened in the lifetimes of the children and families who signed up (for anyone who watched Russell T Davies\u2019s apocalyptic drama Years and Years, there is a worrying tang of familiarity to the clips). These kids were born before 9/11, before the financial crisis, before anyone much cared about the EU. The average price of a house when this series began was less than \u00a380,000; fewer than half of people owned mobile phones. The programme-makers make the wise decision to concentrate on three of the children, now in early adulthood, though some of the others appear occasionally, with insights of their own. This episode is also dedicated to participant Parys Lapper, the son of the artist Alison, who died last year. He was, they say, a much-loved member of the Child of Our Time family. Eve, named after the grandmother who died when her own mother was pregnant with her, was born to evangelical Christian parents. She talks of her mother warmly, in the past tense. Her story is one of grief, then; in 2009, we see her with her father and sister, setting a balloon loose next to a memorial tree. But she also talks about coming out as gay, and how, at 15, it seemed like the most important thing about her, and how at 20, it is not necessarily what she feels compelled to tell people when she meets them for the first time. She is training to be a midwife now, inspired, perhaps, she thinks, by her mother\u2019s caring manner. Jamie had an idyllic-sounding childhood, which he remembers with clear fondness and affection. He was diagnosed with type one diabetes, and recalls some moments of teenage abandon that served as a wake-up call. But the story threaded through his life is of his parents\u2019 marriage and divorce, how good his father was as a dad, and how his father\u2019s affair made him realise how much he would come to value honesty in his own life. He is a chef, and his girlfriend is pregnant. He knows the kind of father he plans to be. The parents take a leading role in the story of Rhianna\u2019s life, too. A sensitive child, she feared breaking the rules to such an extent that her parents took her to see a psychiatrist, who gently pointed out that he recommends the reduction of \u201cfamily conflict\u201d to most of the parents he sees. Rhianna\u2019s parents eventually separated, and she is now studying psychology, trying to understand where she came from. As a tool of child psychology, the series is able to see how lives have unfolded, at every crucial stage, with the benefit of hindsight, and it does seem to confirm the Philip Larkin edict about what one\u2019s parents can do to you. It is even more effective, though, as a portrait of Britain through two decades. Some of the statistics are alarming, such as the growth of reported depression and anxiety in young people, but some are soothing, too, such as the reduction of stigma around discussing personal problems. Any potential for the mockery of a generation of \u201csnowflakes\u201d is given short shrift here, not pointedly, but by example. These young people are articulate, sensitive and sympathetic, and they are clearly also robust. At first, it struck me as unusual that these young adults now can see their lives in this way, captured and archived. Two of the subjects talk about traumatic parts of their lives and how they suspect they have deliberately forgotten about them. But Child of Our Time has footage of those periods. One of the key developments of the past 20 years, though, is that almost everyone\u2019s life is documented now, thanks to smartphones. Their experience has become everyone\u2019s experience, making its resonance even more profound."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
