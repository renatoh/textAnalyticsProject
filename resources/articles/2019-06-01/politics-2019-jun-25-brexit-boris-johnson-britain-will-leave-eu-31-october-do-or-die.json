The frontrunner toughened his Brexit stance as criticism continued over his refusal to answer questions about a police visit to his flat following a loud late-night altercation with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. In a round of interviews designed to put the focus back on his EU policy and away from his personal life, Johnson appeared to signal there was an increasing prospect of a no-deal Brexit three months after he would take office. Johnson first doubled down on his commitment to leaving on 31 October in an interview with Talkradio, saying he was in no way reneging on his firm pledge. \u201cWe are getting ready to come out on 31 October. Come what may,\u201d he said. Asked to confirm this, he added: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He then said he would scrap Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and seek a completely new deal before then, as minor changes would not satisfy him. \u201cI mean more than a change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be, we need a new withdrawal agreement \u2013 if we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.\u201d Not only has the EU said it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, but the timetable would be extremely tight as parliament is in recess over the summer and then sitting for about 10 days before party conference season begins. MPs return midway through October, just a few weeks before the deadline. Johnson then emphasised his position on leaving by 31 October yet again by writing a letter to Jeremy Hunt, his Tory leadership opponent, challenging him to commit to that date \u201ccome what may\u201d. Hunt replied with a dig that Johnson could find out his policy if he turned up to a Sky News head-to-head debate on Tuesday night that Johnson has refused to attend. \u201cHi Boris, it\u2019s good to talk. But no need for snail-mail, why not turn up to Sky tonight and I\u2019ll give you full and frank answers?#BoJoNoShow,\u201d he tweeted. Hunt also tried to claim his Brexit policy was similar to Johnson\u2019s but that he would be a more trusted negotiator to deliver changes that could get through the UK parliament. \u201cWho is the person that we trust to send to Brussels on behalf of the British people and come back with a deal, and that has to be someone that they trust, that they\u2019re prepared to talk to, because in the end you don\u2019t do a deal with someone you don\u2019t trust,\u201d Hunt told the BBC in an interview. In fact, Hunt\u2019s stance is more moderate than that of his rival as he has not committed to leaving on 31 October if he needs more time to do a deal. Johnson also wants to throw out the withdrawal agreement for a new one, while Hunt would be seeking more modest tweaks. In another sign that Johnson\u2019s campaign was taking a more hardline turn, he appointed Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran Eurosceptic and former Tory leader, as his campaign chief. Johnson also revealed Mark Fullbrook, a business partner of the Australia election guru Lynton Crosby, would be formally joining the team. Sources close to the campaign said Eurosceptics in the party were increasingly turning the screws on Johnson by warning they would withdraw support for his government if he fails to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. One of the 28 \u201cSpartan\u201d MPs who voted against May\u2019s withdrawal deal said they would not tolerate minor changes to the agreement repackaged and sold as a great new deal. He said they were working on the assumption that Johnson was heading for a no-deal Brexit and parliament could either be not consulted or simply ignored. Johnson appeared to bear out that strategy in his Talkradio interview in which he said he could categorically rule out an extension to article 50, meaning he believes he has a way to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt would be up to the prime minister of the day. I have myself to decide under the current terms of the extension that we have, to apply for such an extension. And it is up to the EU to decide whether to grant it. At the moment, the law says that the UK is leaving the EU, international treaty law says the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.\u201d At the same time, up to a dozen MPs on the centrist wing of the party, such as Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond, have been warning they could bring down the government in a confidence vote together with opposition parties if Johnson tried to exit without a deal. In an earlier interview on LBC radio, Johnson dismissed the idea his Brexit plans could be hampered by Tory rebels, saying the party was \u201cstaring down the barrel of defeat\u201d if it did not deliver a departure plan, which would focus minds. Johnson has been criticised for hiding during the campaign but he attempted to neutralise that criticism with a series of choreographed campaign visits on Tuesday including a speech to a horticultural society and a walk down a high street in Surrey. He conducted the round of media interviews and was filmed on the campaign trail, after keeping a low profile for the first part of the campaign and dodging questions over the weekend about the screaming row with his partner that prompted a neighbour to call the police. He was asked 26 times on LBC about the provenance of a photograph showing him with his partner smiling in a Sussex garden, which appeared on news websites on Monday. However, Johnson refused every time to say whether it was staged, who released it and whether it was recent. \u201cNewspapers will print whatever they are going to print,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we spend on things extraneous to what I want to do, the bigger the waste of time.\u201d His mood was subdued at a hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, the day after the story of the row broke in the Guardian, where he told the event\u2019s moderator, Iain Dale, that people did not want to know \u201cabout that sort of thing\u201d. But a film has emerged of him giving a rabble-rousing speech to a private garden party later that day, telling Conservative members that the NHS absolutely needs \u201creform\u201d and firing them up for a general election by asking them to be ready to \u201cwallop Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Asked by one party member what he would do with the NHS, Johnson told the crowd the health service was a \u201ccrowning glory\u201d but was \u201cnot getting the kind of support and indeed the kind of changes and management that it needs\u201d, suggesting he as prime minister would aim to undertake an overhaul of the health service. He said Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, had once helped him get elected president of the Oxford Union as a student, and together they would \u201csort things out\u201d. In remarks that may alarm those opposed to another reorganisation of the NHS, Johnson said: \u201cIt needs more money but where you are absolutely right is that it needs reform.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the comments were \u201calarming but unsurprising given the hard-right agenda Johnson has been putting forward\u201d. \u201cHis tax plans will benefit the richest, he\u2019s the biggest defender of the bankers who crashed the economy, and he\u2019s been buddying up with Trump to sell off our NHS to US corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cHis comments to Tory party members about his plans for the NHS need to be clarified immediately.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
