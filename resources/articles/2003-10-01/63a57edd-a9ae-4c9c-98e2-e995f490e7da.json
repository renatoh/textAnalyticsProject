At the age of 51, while heading David Williams and Ketchum, one of the country's largest and most successful advertising agencies, he suffered a severe stroke. Though he overcame partial paralysis and impaired speech to make a more or less complete recovery, he realised that he could not return to the stresses of advertising, and brought his spare-time hobby of crime writing to the centre of his working life. Williams never regretted the decision, though the change made a considerable difference to his economic prospects. He was born in Bridgend, where his father was a journalist on the Western Mail. The family had a love of classic English literature and a strong tradition of storytelling - David started telling stories at the age of seven, while he was at Oldcastle primary school in Bridgend. Though he had passed an audition to join the choir of St Paul's cathedral, he continued his education on a scholarship at the Cathedral school, Hereford. He went on to read modern history at St John's College, Oxford, though his studies were interrupted by the second world war and three years as an officer in the Royal Navy. His career in advertising started with a job as a medical copywriter, and Williams quickly rose through various other companies to be head of his own large agency. During that period he was a frequent commentator on radio and television for a profession that was often vilified, but which he believed could be a positive force for the economic good of the community. Williams, who had always hoped to become a full-time writer, made his debut in 1976 with Unholy Writ, a year before his stroke. His books were in a strong tradition of British crime fiction.\"I write whodunits which are aimed to be above all credible, civilised entertainments, incidentally informative,\" he said. \"And to lace them with humour - the last as an enduring legacy from two friends and mentors, Bruce Montgomery [who wrote as Edmund Crispin] and Kingsley Amis.\" His ultimate hero in crime fiction was the donnishly witty Michael Innes. He was amused by the good reviews he frequently received for his plotting, because \"I rarely know the identity of the killer until the penultimate chapter.\" Whatever his method, it certainly worked. He published 23 novels in all, most of them featuring the urbane and humorous Mark Treasure, vice-chairman of Greenwood, Phipps &amp; Co, merchant bankers. Treasure, whose name appeared in the titles of most of his investigations, was always supported by his successful actress wife Molly, and theirs was one of the more convincing marital partnerships in crime fiction. In 1994 Williams launched a new series of books, which went back to his Welsh roots, featuring Chief Inspector Merlin Parry of the South Wales Constabulary, along with his sidekick, Sergeant Gomer Lloyd. Two of Williams's books were shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award, and in 1988 his eminence in the field was recognised when he was elected to the Detection Club. He was a regular at the club's dinners, where his wit and charm were much appreciated by his fellow members. Williams was a man of strong convictions, but he was temperate in listening to the views of those who did not agree with him. His Anglo-Catholic faith was always strong, so much so that on leaving Oxford he had seriously contemplated the priesthood, and he remained throughout his life what he described as a \"non-celestial churchman\". He was a churchwarden of the Guild Church of St Mary Aldermary, and a governor of Pusey College, Oxford. Asked to name some of the things he cared about, Williams listed \"the Anglican Church, the poetry of the 1662 Prayer Book, and the maintenance of ancient churches and cathedrals - particularly the cathedrals of St Paul's, St David's Llandaff and Hereford\". In his writing, his manner, his conversation and his clothes, Williams was unfailingly elegant, particularly in his trademark white shirt and white tie. He was a man who overcame adversity, and even contrived to triumph over it by reinventing himself. He is survived by his wife Brenda, and a son and daughter. \u00b7 David Williams, crime writer, born June 8 1926; died September 26 2003"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
