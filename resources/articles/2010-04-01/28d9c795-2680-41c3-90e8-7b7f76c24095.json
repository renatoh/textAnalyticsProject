The wannabe candidate, an itinerant musician wearing a shirt emblazoned with the campaign slogan \"Davis Will Save Us\" is busy sucking down a beer and wondering aloud if he should have run for Mayor instead. City Council, he figures, isn't a \"big enough venue to move records\". His advisor pauses. \"Man,\" he says, taking in the filth of the room he's in, \"You could hide a dead prostitute in here.\" Welcome to New Orleans. Or, at least, David Simon's version of it. We're on set in a ramshackle house in Trem\u00e9, a historic New Orleans neighbourhood adjacent to the French Quarter. Founded by \"free people of colour\" and incubator of much of the city's musical heritage, the area also lends its name to the series created by Simon and Eric Overmyer; the former the creator of The Wire, the latter a longtime collaborator. Premiering in the US tomorrow, to say that it's heavily anticipated is a slight understatement. You don't come off of five seasons of what some have called \"the best television series ever made\" and follow it up with a show about New Orleans musicians without a high expectation or two. \"We like to think we've exported all this democracy,\" Simon tells me later. He's a solid man, slightly wincing through a slight back injury sustained earlier in the day, and he speaks with a quiet, calm authority. \"Bullshit. We've exported a lot less democracy than we claim. We like to think that baseball has become a universal. Baseball is not a universal. African-American music is universal. What we're going to be remembered for, if anything, a hundred years from now, in terms of world culture, is going to be African-American music.\" Simon and Overmyer had been chomping at the bit to essay their vision of New Orleans for years. The two had been toying with the idea of the show since working on Homicide: Life On The Street. A subject proved elusive until Simon suggested anchoring the drama around the lives of musicians. The project simmered over the years, throughout production on The Wire and Generation Kill. For a moment, it looked as if Katrina rendered the idea obsolete, but the pair saw dramatic opportunity in the rebuilding efforts of the citizenry, as well as an opportunity to shine a light on an often misrepresented and unique corner of America. Inevitably, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated New Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast, Hollywood came calling. There were incisive documentaries (Spike Lee's When The Levees Broke), earnest independents, (Low And Behold), and ham-handed Hollywood thrillers, (D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu). New Orleans has also hosted college sex comedies, 3-D horror movies and more, every one of them injecting much-needed money into the local economy. But for projects set in New Orleans, authenticity and fidelity to the spirit of the city have been short in supply. The main offender: a cops-with-problems drama called K-Ville. Lasting for one seemingly endless season, it ladled policier cliches on top of New Orleans cliches, creating an almost toxic mix. \"It proved what we were talking about,\" says Overmyer. \"It was sort of a network idea of what [New Orleans was]. It certainly was a blueprint for what not to do. David sold it because he's David,\" Overmyer adds. \"We went up to HBO to see [ex-president] Carolyn Strauss when she was there. She said, 'I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't know what the fuck a Mardi Gras Indian is, but \u2026 OK, go write a pilot.' She said, 'I'm in the David Simon business.' We got to kick the pilot around for a couple of years before we turned it in.\" And though Treme (pronounced \"trih-may\") shares DNA with The Wire (its keen eye for the rhythm of a city, its insightful racial commentary and its sprawling scope come courtesy of Simon, Overmyer and other members of The Wire's tight-knit writing staff, including George Pelecanos and the late David Mills) the two series are wildly divergent. The Wire's focus on politics and crime is largely absent in Treme (for now, though the subject of New Orleans after Katrina has unavoidable political undercurrents). Instead, Treme is about how a city survives despite erosion at the hands of the combined forces of nature, ignorance and economics. The pilot episode of Treme (directed by Agnieszka Holland, another holdover from The Wire) lays out these differences. The first shot one sees is a close-up of a musician's mouth and the reed of his saxophone. A scene that could rival The Wire at its most inscrutable follows, as a brass band negotiates their terms with an employer in a corner bar before a second line parade. Though the action itself is intelligible, the particulars (brass bands, compliments on outlandish outfits) are almost inscrutable. Another aesthetic holdover from The Wire is Treme's Dickens-sized cast of characters. Antoine Batiste (Wire veteran Wendell Pierce) is a perpetually broke trombonist struggling to support a new family and maintain ties with his old one; his ex-wife LaDonna Batiste-Williams (Khandi Alexander) is a bar owner searching for her convict brother lost in the maze of post-Katrina bureaucracy; Toni Bernette (Melissa Leo), is the spread-too-thin civil rights lawyer helping LaDonna track down her brother; Davis McAlary (Steve Zahn) is a lowlife, loudmouth guitarist dedicated to both speaking truth to power and hustling his music; Janette Desautel (Kim Dickens, Joanie from Deadwood) is a chef trying to keep her small restaurant alive; Albert Lambreaux (Clarke Peters, another Wire alumnus) is a Mardi Gras Indian chief with no tribe; Creighton Bernette (John Goodman) is an apoplectic professor entrenched in the messy politics of the rebuilding of New Orleans. Their lives intersect and diverge, and what they all have in common is a Quixote-esque refusal to do anything but live in New Orleans. It's a shared love, conscious and unconscious. What's also striking upon watching the first episode of Treme is its fascination with New Orleans' obscure rituals and arcane signifiers; the dialogue is thick with obscure slang; surreal images (like Peters's Mardi Gras Indian chief walking and chanting through a darkened Lower 9th Ward in full regalia) seem more like dream sequences, until you realise that what you're seeing is actually happening. \"It's going to be a very authentic thing,\" says Wendell Pierce during a break in filming. He should know, after all: he's a New Orleans native. He's just pointed out a house down the street that he used to rent from his childhood friend Lolis Elie, now a local newspaper columnist who's joined Treme's writing staff. \"[Treme] has the pacing of The Wire, so it's going to be a cumulative thing, and I think people outside of New Orleans are going to be dropped into a little foreign world, but the thing that's going to interest them is that they know it's real. That's how people in New Orleans actually deal with life. That's their culture.\" Culture. It's the word that Simon and Overmyer and almost everybody on the set repeats like a mantra when referring to what motivates Treme. \"Cities, especially today, have lost that,\" says Zahn as the crew breaks for lunch. \"They've lost their culture. They celebrate it in, like, 'Atlanta Day'. This town doesn't have a New Orleans 'day' \u2013 it has it every fuckin' day.'\" \"Other cities made cars, Baltimore used to make steel and ships,\" Simon adds. \"New Orleans has one factory that's still open: they manufacture moments. They manufacture these ineffable musical moments. \"We're not making anything in the rest of America any more; it's like that line from The Wire: 'We don't make anything, we just put our hands in the next guy's pocket.' In New Orleans there's a whole passion to provide, for the sake of its own glory, culture and to deliver it as if it was a product. A third of the people aren't back yet but the culture's going to survive and we know this. And we didn't know this five years ago.\" But are they afraid of falling into the trap of obvious cliches, or misrepresenting the city? \"I am not sanguine that we're not going to suffer our share of ridicule, because everyone in New Orleans feels passionate in their defence of the authentic. And everyone has their own version of New Orleans. You have to make choices and say we're going to show this and not that ... or we're going to get to that in a later episode. And you realise that three or four New Orleanians are going to write you off. 'You fucking frauds.' And how can you argue with them? That's why this city didn't become Atlanta or Houston. It's because what somebody did 60, 70, 80, 100 or 150 years ago mattered to everybody who came after them.\" Treme airs in the UK late 2010 Old New Orleans Visually referenced throughout Treme and cited by the series' creators as a major influence, Always For Pleasure is a 1977 film by veteran documentarian Les Blank. \"Eric and I love that documentary,\" says David Simon. Always For Pleasure is less a rigorous analysis of New Orleans than a visual riff on the city's unique rhythms and rituals. Directed by Blank, (whose credits include Burden Of Dreams, an account of the production of Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo) and shot in luminous 16mm, the obscure documentary is a kaleidoscopic portrait of New Orleans during 1977. Scenes flow from sombre, brass-scored funeral marches to raucous street dancing, to beer drinking Indian chiefs, to Professor Longhair playing in a dive, to a black woman hilariously breaking down the racial realities of Mardi Gras, and beyond, all with little or no authorial comment. The result: an impressionistic, ramshackle account of New Orleans' cultural life that encapsulates its lackadaisical delirium, yet keeps it \u2013 like the city that is its focus \u2013 admirably loose."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
