The economy has to work for all", "bodyText": "When it comes to the vital public services that we all rely on, I want the British people to have the very best. A first-class health service, which is there for all of us in our time of need. Brilliant schools that give every child the very best start in life. Twenty-first century infrastructure in every community, which serves the needs of our economy. We should always aim for the best and never settle for anything less. And government and private enterprise have always worked together to achieve great things. From the Royal Navy warships, built by private businesses on the Clyde and elsewhere, to the Channel Tunnel and Crossrail, which were delivered by a consortium of firms in partnership with the state, the partnership between the public and private sectors has delivered for this country. Without the invention, innovation and creativity of private enterprise, working in partnership with strategic and democratically accountable governments and local councils, we would not be able to build the roads and railways, hospitals and schools, sports stadiums and shopping centres that we use, day in and day out. Neither can do it on their own \u2013 it is the partnership that makes it happen. And in the delivery of our public services, time and again, the private sector plays a valuable role helping to support the public sector. By lending additional capacity and expertise, independent providers can help deliver a better service \u2013 and better outcomes \u2013 for people. This does not need to be a matter of political contention. Indeed it was a Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, who said: \u201cIf an old age pensioner who used to wait two years for her cataract operation now gets it on the NHS in an independent treatment centre, in three months, free at the point of use, that is not damaging the NHS: it is fulfilling its purpose.\u201d I know those who work hard every day to provide vital services to the public bring exactly the same level of dedication and professionalism to their work, regardless of whether they are employed by the government or local council directly or work for a business that is contracted to provide that service. All deserve our gratitude and respect. But a free society \u2013 and a free market \u2013 only works when everyone plays by the same rules. While I don\u2019t believe the government should involve itself in the day-to-day management of businesses, the state can and should help to rebalance the system in favour of ordinary working people. And since I became prime minister, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been doing. Indeed, no government has done more than this one to take action in this area. Everyone is now able to see when companies have significant shareholder opposition to bosses\u2019 pay. In the spring, we will set out new tough new rules for executives who try to line their own pockets by putting their workers\u2019 pensions at risk \u2013 an unacceptable abuse that we will end. By this time next year, all listed companies will have to reveal the pay ratio between bosses and workers. Companies will also have to explain how they take into account their employees\u2019 interests at board level, giving unscrupulous employers nowhere to hide. And, for the first time, businesses will have to demonstrate that they have taken into account the long-term consequences of their decisions. Too often, we\u2019ve seen top executives reaping big bonuses for recklessly putting short-term profit ahead of long-term success. Our best businesses know that is not a responsible way to run a company and those who do so will be forced to explain themselves. The state also has a role to play when things go wrong and companies fail, as Carillion did last week. Not by bailing out the directors with a blank cheque \u2013 it will be the shareholders of Carillion, not taxpayers, who pay the price for the company\u2019s collapse \u2013 but by stepping in and supporting those affected. The minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, has co-ordinated the government\u2019s response, acting swiftly to safeguard the continuity of public services. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has already convened a task force involving business and unions to support firms and workers affected by the collapse of Carillion. Whether it\u2019s the schools that educate employees, the roads that goods are delivered on, or even the courts that enforce contract law, every successful business is built on a thriving, supportive society. But that support is conditional \u2013 it can only exist as long as we all playing by the same rules. As prime minister, I\u2019m determined to ensure we do \u2013 to level the playing field and stand up to the small minority of businesses that give the majority a bad name. That way, we can sustain the free-market economy that has brought our country such prosperity for so long and ensure the public and private sectors continue to work side by side providing the world-class services that the people of the UK expect and deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
