In a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Facebook and Google, as well as Nick Clegg and Kent Walker, the heads of policy of the respective companies, the campaigners write that \u201cwith the announcement of the election coming in only six weeks, there is no time for regulations to catch up\u201d with the reality of online advertising. \u201cThis legislative blackspot is particularly concerning in light of Facebook\u2019s recent policies to allow politicians to openly publish disinformation through ads. Equally concerning is the lack of transparency as to what data is being used to target ads, and how such ads are being targeted,\u201d they say. \u201cAs we prepare to enter purdah, and without proper legislation, we\u2019re calling on you to take a stand and issue an immediate moratorium on all political and issue-based advertising on your platforms until the conclusion of the UK parliamentary elections on 12 December.\u201d The letter, signed by representatives of seven organisations including Mozilla, Doteveryone, the Open Data Institute and Sheffield University, notes the decision to voluntarily pause political adverts is not without precedent. \u201cGoogle blocked political advertising two weeks before polling day,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIn the Israeli and Canadian elections, political ads were blocked outright for the duration of the election period.\u201d Twitter has announced a voluntary suspension of all political adverts, with the chief executive, Jack Dorsey, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad \u2026 well \u2026 they can say whatever they want\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
