Nine months after he was controversially sacked in the aftermath of England\u2019s 5-0 whitewash in Australia, Pietersen also implicated the wicketkeeper Matt Prior in a campaign to undermine him but praised England\u2019s captain, Alastair Cook, in his first interview to promote the release on Thursday of KP: The Autobiography. The South African-born batsman also reiterated his desire to represent his adopted country again despite falling out with Flower and Paul Downton, the managing director of the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cHorrendous. Hugely disturbing,\u201d Pietersen told The Telegraph when asked to describe the culture of bullying which developed under Flower. \u201cI brought it up. All throughout my reintegration meetings [after he was suspended for sending text messages to South African players in 2012] I brought it up on numerous occasions. I told [Andrew] Strauss about it. I told Cook about it. It was a huge thing.\u201d In particular the bowlers Graeme Swann, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are singled out for \u201crunning the dressing room\u201d, with fielders routinely forced to apologise for errors and dropped catches. \u201cThe bowlers were given so much power. They were doing really well,\u201d he said. Swanny [Graeme Swann] was winning game after game for us. Broady [Stuart Broad] was contributing. Jimmy [Anderson] was contributing. We always had a third or fourth seamer that was there or thereabouts. But these guys ran the dressing room. \u201cThe thing that horrified me the most was when Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss in Bangalore before the one-day internationals said: \u2018Guys, we\u2019ve got to stop this. It\u2019s not right for the team. There are guys that have come to [us] that are intimidated to field the ball.\u2019 \u201cAnd they [the bowlers] had the audacity to stand there and say: \u2018No, if they\u2019ve fucked up we deserve an apology.\u2019 It\u2019s the most angry I ever got in that dressing room. I thought, I reckon I could hit these guys. Who do you think you are, to ask for an apology from someone who\u2019s trying his heart out, who\u2019s playing for his country, who\u2019s making a mistake?\u201d Despite those accusations Pietersen says his relationship with both Broad and Anderson is \u201cfine\u201d, while describing Cook as having been put in \u201can incredibly difficult situation\u201d over the manner of his sacking. Yet there is no such sympathy for Flower, who left his post in January to take up a new role as technical director of elite coaching, or Prior. \u201cHe stayed a selector until he sacked me and now he\u2019s got some cushy job where he\u2019s looking after younger players at the academy,\u201d Pietersen says of Flower. \u201cAre you crazy? When he was selected as the England A coach this summer I thought: \u2018Oh, my days. Poor youngsters.\u2019 \u201d Prior\u2019s own international career is on hold after being dropped at the start of the summer but it is the wicketkeeper who comes under the most criticism. \u201cI went after Prior and said Prior shouldn\u2019t be in that side because he\u2019s a bad influence, a negative influence \u2013 he picks on players \u2013 and I\u2019ve questioned Flower and the way he ran the team. Flower and Cook would have said [in response] \u2018you\u2019ve got to get rid of this guy [Pietersen]. He\u2019s back-stabbing, he\u2019s horrendous, he\u2019s bad for the environment\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s only Prior that I\u2019d seriously have real issues with, because of how he was portrayed as a team man, the heart and soul of the dressing room, when he was getting up to the stuff he was getting up to.\u201d \u201cHe wanted to start a media campaign to stop me getting the vice-captaincy. That\u2019s what I took him up on in January when I got sacked. Is that seriously the heart and soul of the dressing room? This big team player?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
