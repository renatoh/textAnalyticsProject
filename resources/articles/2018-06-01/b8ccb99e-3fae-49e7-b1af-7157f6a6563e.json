The judges commended Gentleman\u2019s determination in pursuing the issue, which led to the resignation of home secretary Amber Rudd and the government loosening its \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for migrants. \u201cThe judges were impressed by the tenacity of Amelia Gentleman\u2019s work, her determination to tell the stories of the victims of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy, and the enormous impact her work had, proving that good reporting really can make a difference,\u201d said Padraig Reidy, the chair of the judges. Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, which runs the awards, said: \u201cCongratulations to Amelia Gentleman for a campaign that was revelatory, important and amazingly effective. This was the Windrush scandal \u2013 where a cabinet minister was thrown overboard and the ship of state nearly sank.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner said: \u201cAmelia Gentleman\u2019s determined and empathetic reporting exposed a national scandal, and gave a voice to the Windrush generation. Amelia has shown brilliantly that independent, investigative journalism can hold power to account and change the world. I\u2019m really delighted for her.\u201d The young journalist award went to Emma Yeomans and Ben van der Merwe of the London Student for their Toby Young and UCL\u2019s secret eugenics conference investigation. Gentleman\u2019s work focused on immigration troubles wrongly forced upon Commonwealth-born British citizens. Other nominees included the Observer\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr, whose work on the Cambridge Analytica files was praised, the Times\u2019 Sean O\u2019Neill, whose name was put forward for his reporting on the Oxfam sex abuse scandal, and Madison Marriage of the Financial Times for her work on a charity fundraiser where female hostesses were \u201cput on show\u201d. The Sunday Post\u2019s Gordon Blackstock was nominated for his investigation into the burials of hundreds of orphans in a mass grave, as was BuzzFeed\u2019s investigations team for its \u201cFrom Russia with blood\u201d reporting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
