The 75-year-old billionaire, who is the world's second richest man after Microsoft's Bill Gates, acquired 57.6m Tesco shares - nearly 1% of the company - through his Berkshire Hathaway investment group. Details of the investment in the UK's biggest retailer came in a US regulatory filing after the market had closed. Yesterday Tesco shares closed up 1% at 319.75p, valuing the supermarket at about \u00a324bn. Last night Tesco said it had not been contacted by Berkshire Hathaway, but the share purchase will be viewed as a huge vote of confidence in Tesco's chief executive Sir Terry Leahy and his strategy to transform the Cheshunt-based grocer into a vast, international operator. It will also be viewed as a stamp of approval for Tesco's decision to take on the giant Wal-Mart organisation by launching a chain of convenience stores in California. Mr Buffett used to have a stake in Wal-Mart. He is known for buying stakes in stable companies with good prospects. Last month Tesco, which has 1,900 stores, announced a 17% leap in profits to \u00a32.2bn in one of the most challenging years on the UK high street. Some \u00a342bn of sales were generated worldwide. Outside the UK the group's profits climbed 17% to \u00a3465m. A further 392 new overseas outlets are scheduled to open in the coming 12 months - together with another 150 in the UK. Mr Buffett's investment comes a week after he said he was ready to spend up to $30bn (\u00a316bn) over the next three years and was keen to invest outside the US. A stake in Tesco will give Mr Buffett exposure to the UK, eastern Europe, the Asian-Pacific and China. Tesco is also thought to be talking with a potential joint venture partner to open a chain of stores across India in order to cater for the country's rapidly expanding middle class. Mr Buffett, who is famous for his home-spun investment philosophy, has historically preferred blue-chip US companies. He owns the vast General Re insurance group and a number of other financial services companies outright, along with businesses specialising in jewellery, executive jets and the American clothing brand Fruit of the Loom. He has big stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express, UPS and this week spent $18m on a small stake in oil group ConocoPhillips. He recently spent $4bn on Iscar, an Israeli tool-cutting business, and told Berkshire Hathaway's 24,000 shareholders at the investment group's annual meeting that a $15bn deal was under consideration. The group is sitting on $43bn in cash but Mr Buffett said: \"We'd be happier, much happier, if we had $10bn of cash.\" Although he gave few clues on targets he made it clear he was looking at overseas deals as a way of spreading Berkshire's currency risk. Last year Mr Buffett made a bad call with a $22bn bet on the foreign exchange markets that the dollar would fall. It went disastrously wrong, resulting in a near-$1bn loss. Last night Berkshire Hathaway was unavailable for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
