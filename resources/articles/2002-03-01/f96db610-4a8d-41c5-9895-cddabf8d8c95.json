When Gyles Brandreth took the stage to present the first of 20 gongs at the British Book Awards, or \"Nibbies\", the Loafer settled in behind a large glass of wine and thought longingly of cocoa and slippers. Covert dozing was, however, impossible with such scintillating trophies as The VISTA Computer Services Supply Chain Performer of the Year Award in prospect. As ever, it was the celeb presenters, on a three-line whip from their publishers, who provided the glitz, and they don't come much glitzier than Joan Collins, resplendent in mauve and with new husband Percy in tow. Mel B told us that \"vaginas are beautiful\"; Jilly Cooper, fresh from The Weakest Link, quoted Auden; Richard materialised, quite disconcertingly, without Judy. By far the biggest cheers were reserved for David Essex, sadly sans motorbike, and Billy Connolly, whose wife, Pamela Stephenson, scooped the Book of the Year Award for Billy. \"I had very little to do with this book,\" said its subject, \"apart from lying in bed and answering a lot of very impertinent questions.\" \u00b7 HarperCollins was responsible for signing Stephenson up, which probably contributed to its victory in the Publisher of the Year Award. CEO Victoria Barnsley was clearly keen to acknowledge the debt, as a triumphant email to staff the following morning demonstrates. \"Last night HarperCollins took the Nibbies by storm,\" it went. \"Pamela Anderson's Billy won Book of the Year.\" We'd never had the rather sophisticated Barnsley down as a clandestine Baywatch fan, but you should never judge a book by its cover. \u00b7 Many thanks to Penguin for sensitively scheduling a lunch to celebrate Toby Litt's Exhibitionism for the day after the Nibbies. Barely had the Loafer's head hit the pillow than it was time to carouse again, this time at an exotic restaurant specialising in things one normally sees at the zoo. How glad the fragile diners were to have a menu of kangaroo, cobra, zebra and scorpion placed before them. The Loafer's modest caesar salad did not, we were assured, contain actual wind-dried Roman emperor. \u00b7 We've got you bang to rights, Libby Purves. Here is the doyenne of Midweek on Nick Hornby's How to Be Good, in the Times: \"His is a lovely fictional voice: humane, amused, perceptive, free of vanity... Hornby writes astonishingly well from a woman's perspective... I went back to the beginning and enjoyed it all over again.\" And here she is on the same topic on a BBC website: \"It's OK, but nothing near as good as its hype, or his earlier ones, and I just don't believe the heroine.\" Quite right: you should never fall for the hype."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
