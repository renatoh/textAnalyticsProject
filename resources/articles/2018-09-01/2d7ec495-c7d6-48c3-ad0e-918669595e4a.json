The prime minister made the suggestion on Tuesday after criticising Byron shire council, which is the third local government to be stripped of its right to hold citizenship ceremonies after voting not to hold them on 26 January. Morrison said he wasn\u2019t sure what form or on what date a new day celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would take place, adding it would need the agreement of states and territories and consideration of the \u201cimplications for businesses\u201d of adding a new public holiday, but he said he would welcome a public discussion. He suggested 27 May, the day of the 1967 referendum to formally count Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as part of the population, as one option. It follows National Sorry Day on 26 May, which was also the date that the Uluru statement from the heart, the biggest Indigenous-led push for reconciliation and reform through constitutional change, was unveiled in 2017. The idea has attracted criticism from a number of Indigenous people, including Gunnai-Kurnai and Gundijmara Lidia Thorpe, a Greens MP, who said creating a separate day for Aboriginal people \u201cdoesn\u2019t create unity.\u201d Others said they were tired of this debate when substantive reforms like the Uluru statement were not progressed. Liberal minister Ken Wyatt welcomed the concept, describing the idea of an Indigenous day as \u201ca great step forward\u201d and suggested it be held during NAIDOC Week in July. Morrison\u2019s special envoy for Indigenous affairs, former prime minister Tony Abbott, was less enthusiastic. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got things like NAIDOC Week and National Sorry Day and so on, and really I think the emphasis ... is on all pulling together on Australia Day, being proud of what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he told 2GB radio. Morrison has not commented on the Uluru statement since becoming prime minister but his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, and his Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, said its core proposal of a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous representative body was not \u201cdesirable\u201d and would not be supported. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to pull Australia Day down to actually recognise the achievements of Indigenous Australians, the oldest living culture in the world,\u201d Morrison told Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise program on Tuesday. \u201cThe two can coexist.\u201d He said 26 January 1788, the day the first fleet of British convict ships sent to Australia relocated to Sydney Cove, was \u201cthe fulcrum point\u201d in history. \u201cThat was the day Australia changed forever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t that day. \u201cWe should be acknowledging the great work of Indigenous Australians and their contribution to our nation \u2026 but you don\u2019t need to tear down one group to hear from another.\u201d Morrison said he understood that some who opposed celebrating a national holiday on 26 January did so out of respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but he said refusing to celebrate the day was \u201csilly\u201d. \u201cIndulgent self-loathing does not make Australia stronger,\u201d he said in a Facebook post on Monday. The acting Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for Morrison to \u201cfloat such a significant idea like this through the media with zero consultation\u201d. \u201cUnlike Scott Morrison, we\u2019ll consult Indigenous people and our Indigenous caucus about whether a proper day of recognition with an additional public holiday is a positive way forward \u2013 we\u2019re open to it,\u201d she said. Plibersek reiterated the Labor party\u2019s support for an Indigenous voice to parliament and the Uluru statement. \u201cLabor supports Australia Day staying on 26th Jan, although we understand it\u2019s a difficult day for many Australians,\u201d she said. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said Australia would \u201cnever have a day that brings this nation together if we continue to celebrate it [on 26 January].\u201d He accused Morison of engaging \u201cin another culture war\u201d rather than \u201crecognising we are not going to as a nation heal if we continue to ignore our past.\u201d Byron shire council voted last week to shift its Australia Day ceremony to 25 January and was this week stripped of its right to hold citizenship ceremonies, joining Darebin and Yarra councils as local governments no longer able to perform the function. Support for changing the date of Australia Day has gained momentum in recent years. As many as 60,000 people marched in an Invasion Day protest in Melbourne this year, with similar protests held around the country. Reconciliation Australia, the national expert body on reconciliation, said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to unify around 26 January as a national day, saying it was \u201clike asking them to dance on their ancestors\u2019 graves\u201d. A poll by the Australia Institute in January found that 49% of Australians said Australia Day should not be held on a day that is offensive to Indigenous Australians and 56% did not mind on what date it was held. with agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
