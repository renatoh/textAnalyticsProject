It's a powerful word, redolent of Mussolini, Hitler and Franco. Its use has permeated some of the most bitter political arguments since the second world war but it has emerged with new vigour in the wake of the European elections. As Ian Traynor, the Guardian's European editor, wrote on 27 May: \"The fallout from the tumultuous European elections has begun to hit politics across the continent, as a senior member of the German government labelled France's Front National fascist, a description echoed by a European commission leader. \"Speaking at a conference in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and one of the most influential politicians in the EU, deplored the outcome of the polls in France at the weekend, when Marine Le Pen's Front National made its biggest breakthrough to win the ballot, with 25% of the vote. \"'A quarter of the [French] electorate voted not for a rightwing party but for a fascist, extremist party,' said Sch\u00e4uble.\" Marine Le Pen has previously gone to court in France seeking to ban her party being labelled a fascist one \u2013 she lost. Le Pen sued Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the far left Front de Gauche in 2011 after he said she was \"un fasciste\". The judge decided that \"fascist\" was free of any injurious slant when it was used between political adversaries in a political debate or discussion. So \"fascist\" could be slanderous when used outside a political context or \"if accompanied by other degrading terms\", but not by politicians. The word was also used by Viviane Reding, vice-president of the European commission. Asked by a Swiss television station whether the FN's triumph imperilled democracy in Europe, she responded: \"It is absolutely dangerous, like all fascism.\" Newspapers, including the Guardian, are using it to refer to some of the parties following the elections. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung yesterday headlined a post-election profile on the Front National \"Camembert fascism\". I agree with Philip Oltermann, the Guardian's Berlin correspondent, who thinks that the larger numbers of MEPs for parties on the right make this the time for a debate on the use of the word: \"I wondered when and how we use the word 'fascist' in the Guardian. Do we no longer use it at all, because it feels like something that belongs to another era? And if so, should we reconsider in the light of current political developments across Europe?\" The Guardian style guide's entry for the word relates only to spelling: \"Fascism, fascist not facism, facist, a careless but common error.\" So, I turned to the New Oxford English dictionary, which uses this definition: \"an authoritarian and nationalistic rightwing system of government and social organisation\". There is a further helpful note: \"Derives from the Italian totalitarian party of Mussolini (1922 to 1943) and the regimes of the Nazis in Germany and Franco in Spain. Fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group, a contempt for democracy, an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader, and a strong demagogic approach.\" \"Fascist\" resonates in different ways in different places. It is \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 a particularly sensitive word in Germany. Oltermann says: \"Sch\u00e4uble is the last remaining link in Merkel's cabinet to the Kohl era where one of the main objectives of the European project was preventing the return of fascist and ultra-nationalist political powers. He is of a generation with a radar that is ultra-sensitive to the totalitarian objectives that may hide behind rightwing political parties' 'respectable' veneers.\" On the whole Guardian foreign correspondents are wary about using the word unless quoting someone else. Oltermann: \"I would instinctively be quite uncomfortable about using the word to describe a political party in print unless there is evidence of strong anti-democratic, authoritarian tendencies. The NPD [National Democratic Party of Germany] is an interesting case, because they, like the FN, have been very keen to distance themselves from the term.\" On the website of the party's Stuttgart branch, it says: \"Fascism is not an opinion, but a political system that the NPD rejects.\" He says that politicians and the federal court in Germany have for the last 10 years tried to find ways in which they can ban the party. \"I expect the NPD are therefore trying to be very strict internally about cracking down on anything that might hint at a rejection of democratic principles (though plenty of comments have slipped out that would make you think they despise democracy, such as Udo Voigt [the party's former leader] describing modern Germany as an 'illegitimate system'),\" he says. Kim Willsher, a Guardian correspondent in Paris, agrees: \"I would personally feel uneasy using the term 'fascist' to describe Marine Le Pen or the Front National, even without the threat of legal action. This unease, however, may be down to semantics rather than what the word actually means these days. For me, and again it is only a personal view, the choice of words reflects not only their actual meaning but what they imply, and calling Marine Le Pen a 'fascist' is akin to calling her a Nazi and I don't think that, at the current time, would be fair or accurate. \"Another factor is that Le Pen and the FN like to play the victim card, claiming they are 'victims' of the press, the system, the elite. To call them fascist seems also to play into this 'everyone's against us' game and gives them a chance to avoid the real issues.\" Traynor thinks the word should be used sparingly, lest it be devalued: \"It's pretty much a specific Italian-German system peculiar to the 1920s to 1940s. If generally drawing parallels, I prefer 'neo-fascist'.\" He also believes that there are strong gradations now in Europe and the parties of the far-right should not all be lumped together. He uses the term \"neo-fascist\" to describe Hungary's Jobbik and Greece's Golden Dawn parties, which stand apart in their extremism. He describes the FN as \"a party rooted in racism and antisemitism\" and he would never describe the rightwing parties in Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland or Ukip in Britain as fascist but far right or extreme right. I agree with my colleagues that fascist is a word that should be used with pinpoint accuracy if the voters throughout Europe are to retain focus in the gloop of far-right rhetoric."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
