The Japanese are keen to learn what type of behaviour they should expect from England fans, particularly once they have taken alcohol. They will film fans, especially in the city's bars, and copies of the video will be distributed to the three cities that will host England's World Cup matches. A booklet is also be ing produced on what local people, police and officials should expect. Massive security will be in place at English ports and airports today to prevent known or suspected hooligans from attending tonight's match. Extra police will be on duty in Amsterdam and fencing is being erected at the ground to keep rival fans apart and prevent objects being thrown on to the pitch. Undercover English police who track the movement of football hooligans, known as spotters, will also be present. The National Criminal Intelligence Service has warned that any England fans arrested will be subject to international banning orders and prevented from travelling to the cup. A total of 822 such orders have been issued, preventing hooligans from travelling when England are abroad. The NCIS has said that any orders that expire before the tournament will be renewed and that it hopes to have 1,000 in place by then. Of the 10,000 England fans expected in Amsterdam, 7,500 are members of the England supporters' club and have tickets. The remainder are expected to be allowed to buy them because Dutch officials believe it is better to have fans in the stadium, where they can be monitored, than outside. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
