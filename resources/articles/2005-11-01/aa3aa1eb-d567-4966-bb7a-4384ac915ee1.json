Turnout was low, estimated at 15%, and a victory was already guaranteed for Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF, which ran unopposed in 19 of the 50 elected seats. Mr Mugabe and his supporters can also appoint 16 more senators. Incomplete results yesterday saw the ruling party take six senate seats in Harare while the MDC won five seats in the second city of Bulawayo. Results from rural areas were still trickling in. But the MDC's success in Bulawayo left the opposition movement divided both on political and tribal lines, as the seats were contested despite a call by the MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai for a boycott of the polls. Mr Tsvangirai said yesterday that he was vindicated by the low numbers of voters. He vowed to lead a newly radicalised party prepared to take to the streets rather than contest elections. \"We were proved right in our assessment of the national sentiment,\" said Mr Tsvangirai. \"We must change gears from discredited election processes that bring pain to our people to an era of democratic mass confrontation with the dictatorship - an era of non-violent mass resistance.\" He said the MDC should set aside its internal squabbles to demand a new constitution. A group of 26 MDC members defied Mr Tsvangirai and stood for senate seats. They were backed by a substantial part of the MDC, especially in its stronghold in the southern Matabeleland region, who argue that the party must strive for as much representation as possible. Mr Tsvangirai expelled the 26 candidates, an action which his rivals within the MDC said violated the party's constitution. The senate elections come as Zimbabwe is gripped by a dramatically worsening economy. Inflation is 411% and rising. Hunger has reached from the rural areas into the cities and the collapse of the country's water supply and health service has caused deaths from malnutrition and dysentery. \"This is yet another tragedy for Zimbabwe,\" said Iden Wetherell, an editor of the country's two remaining independent newspapers, the Zimbabwe Independent and the Standard. \"At the moment when the country is crying out for solutions, both political and economic, the best democratic alternative has collapsed into name-calling. The MDC intends to go down fighting, unfortunately not Zanu-PF but itself.\" The senate, a legislative upper chamber that will approve or reject bills passed by the lower House of Assembly, is of little consequence. After abolishing the senate in 1990, Mr Mugabe pushed through a constitutional amendment to re-establish it earlier this year. Critics say the reconstitution of the senate was merely a way for Mr Mugabe to increase his patronage. The new house has no veto powers over legislation passed by the ruling party-dominated lower house. \"The new senate is nothing more than Mugabe hitching additional carriages on the Zanu-PF gravy train,\" said Daniel Molokele, a political commentator. Backstory The Movement for Democratic Change has posed the greatest challenge that President Robert Mugabe's ruling party, Zanu-PF, has faced since it came to power at Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Founded in September 1999, the MDC is a coalition springing from the unions, church groups and other organisations. The MDC also draws support both from the majority Shona and the minority Ndebele ethnic groups, black and white citizens and from the cities and rural areas. The MDC came within a whisker of winning the June 2000 parliamentary elections, taking 57 of the 120 elected seats, despite violence and vote rigging. Despite the unfair electoral system, the MDC never took to the streets to challenge Mr Mugabe's increasingly dictatorial rule. The new split in the MDC divides the party along regional and ethnic lines with Morgan Tsvangirai heading the Shona side in Harare and Welshman Ncube leading the Ndebele group in Matabeleland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
