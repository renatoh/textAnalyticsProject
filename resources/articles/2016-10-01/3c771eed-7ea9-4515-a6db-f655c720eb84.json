A Newspoll taken between 6 and 9 October and released on Monday shows One Nation would win 6% of the national vote in the House of Representatives. That compares with 2% in a Newspoll in late August and 1.3% at the 2 July election. But One Nation\u2019s lower house vote at the election was pushed down by the fact it only ran candidates in 12 lower house seats in Queensland and three in New South Wales. It recorded a Senate vote of 4.3% at the election nationwide. According to the Newspoll, One Nation has reached 10% lower house support in Queensland, up from 5.5% at the election, and a small increase from its Senate vote of 9.2%. According to the results One Nation would win 6% of the vote in the lower house in New South Wales and Western Australia. In those two states One Nation won 4% of the Senate vote at the election, despite not running candidates in many lower house seats. In South Australia, One Nation is polling at 4% and in Victoria at 3%, both slightly higher than in the Senate election. The Newspoll recorded the Coalition as having a primary vote of 39%, down 3% since the election and Labor with a vote of 36%, up 1.3%. The Greens were steady on 10%. The Nick Xenophon Team had 2% support, compared with 1.8% at the election. Other parties and independents were down from 9.9% at the election to 7%, suggesting One Nation\u2019s support came at the expense of other minor parties. Appearing on Seven\u2019s Sunrise on Monday in their joint segment, the Justice party senator Derryn Hinch congratulated Hanson for going up in the polls. Asked about One Nation\u2019s support on 2GB Radio, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said government \u201cis not an easy thing\u201d and crossbench senators didn\u2019t face the same pressure. \u201cI understand that people feel anxious about what is happening in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s wages have not been growing like they used to back in the days of John Howard and Peter Costello, since the GFC. \u201cThey feel anxious about trade \u2026 about foreign investment, and they feel anxious about foreign investment.\u201d Morrison said the government had to control the borders and apply national interest tests to foreign investment and trade deals to reassure people. \u201cThat\u2019s the task we\u2019ve set ourselves \u2013 to show why that is making Australians richer, it always has over the last 200 years, but there will always be some anxious about those issues and I suspect that translates support to other political parties.\u201d Hanson\u2019s four Senate votes are important to the government\u2019s legislative agenda, as it needs One Nation\u2019s support to pass bills in the upper house if Labor and the Greens oppose them. On Wednesday the Turnbull government removed a veteran Nationals senator from the membership of a parliamentary committee to give one of its own spots to Hanson. One Nation has helped the Turnbull government pass its amendments to the Fair Work Act to deal with the Victorian Country Fire Authority dispute. The four senators will also be critical to pass two bills tightening regulation on unions, the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill and the registered organisations bill. One Nation senators have hinted that they favour a crackdown on unions but have not announced a final position. On Tuesday Hanson is going to Norfolk Island on a three-day \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d at the invitation of Norfolk Island People for Democracy, a group opposed to the Australian government\u2019s revoking of the island\u2019s autonomy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
