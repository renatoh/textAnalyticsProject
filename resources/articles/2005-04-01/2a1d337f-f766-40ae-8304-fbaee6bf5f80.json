We have principles of tolerance and social justice. By international standards we are an affluent society. But we can and must do better. We're not in the business of talking Britain down. In fact, quite the opposite. We're going to talk Britain up. We are ambitious for Britain. We want a fairer Britain. A Britain of real opportunity for young people and of dignity for our older people. A Britain with quality local public services - good schools and clean hospitals. So the Liberal Democrats will fight this campaign based on real solutions to the real problems people face every day. We're going to address people's hopes, not play on their fears. We're going to be the positive force for good in this general election. People feel badly let down by Labour. They're never going to regain the trust of the British people. Frankly, they don't deserve to. When you break your promises over tax increases and imposing student top-up fees, people don't forget. Nor will people forgive the fact that Tony Blair lined up with George Bush and we were misled into the Iraq war. The Liberal Democrats have been principled and consistent on all these matters during the last parliament. And we're going to stay principled and consistent throughout this campaign and into the next parliament, which I am determined will see us present in much larger numbers.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
