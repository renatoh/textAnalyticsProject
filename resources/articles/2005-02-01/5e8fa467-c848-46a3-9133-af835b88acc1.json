Despite the fact that the two sides' animosity has become a caricature of a parody of a spoof of pastiche of a farce, there's still plenty of self-aggrandising, one-eye-on-the-mirror posturing going on (and not just in Graham Poll's dressing room) as the players prepare to hack lumps out of/throw pizza at each other again. Not that Gary Neville's scared. \"We have played in grounds with a far more hostile atmosphere than Highbury,\" he said, jutting out his bottom lip. \"When you go to Newcastle, Liverpool, Leeds or Manchester City, it is far more intense. We are all experienced enough to have played in games like this before, so this one carries no different feeling than most others,\" he added, shooting an unnerving smile at Jose Antonio Reyes. Sir Alex Ferguson also went for the tough-guy approach, plumping for Anfield as the worst venue. \"And as for Elland Road, deary me!\" he added, clearly hoping to pummel Arsene Wenger into submission with a terrifyingly good impression of Mrs Doubtfire. \"I've no fears about there being any problems. My players behave themselves properly,\" he continued, casually licking his index finger and marking a line in the air, as Jermaine Pennant pleaded guilty to drink driving charges. But what's this? Wenger talking about football? \"The winner will fight for the championship,\" he insisted, tossing the weighty script from Britney &amp; Christina B*tchFight Inc. aside. \"The loser will be out of it,\" he added smugly, as the bookies put Arsenal favourites at 13-10. \"Football is never predictable, but it is always possible for this match to be a classic.\" Classic might be pushing it, for the Fiver's money. Ceaseless, bugle-blowing hype normally comes before a decidedly soggy squib, after all. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I honestly believe that we are stronger coming out of the transfer window than we were going into it\" - Frank Arnesen makes a bold statement after adding Andy Reid, Michael Dawson, Radek Cerny, Emil Hallfredsson, David Limbersky, Mounir El Hamdaoui and Mido to the Spurs squad in January. ********************* FEEBLE LEGALS \"The scandal will put Peter Kenyon under intolerable pressure to resign,\" boomed the News of the Screws on Sunday after accusing Chelsea's medium-sized cheese Peter Kenyon of holding forbidden transfer talks with Arsenal's Ashley Cole. Journalists, appointed by god to uphold the virtues of a great civilisation, have been in a frenzy ever since. Yet for a man who is under intolerable pressure, not to mention fat and bald, Kenyon looked remarkably untroubled today. Puffing his chest - OK, belly - out and sporting that nonchalantly-nauseating look that confidants of the super-rich so often favour, he smarmily deflected questions about wrongdoing. \"We're not going to add to the speculation, you'll never end it,\" he oozed, \"we can't just knock back every story.\" Not exactly a categorical rebuttal, but why should he bother mounting a defence? After all, allegations of a serpentine approach for Steven Gerrard have gone nowhere - while when he was snapped chumming it with Sven during Claudio Ranieri's time at Chelsea, he was able to shrug it off as \"an informal chat\". And hey, even if he were found guilty of making an illegal approach for a player, what are the FA going to do about it? Hit Chelsea with the same \u00a320,000 fine they slapped on Liverpool for tapping up Christian Ziege five years ago? Or maybe - oh please Lord no - reach for an even more recent and fearsome precedent and whack them with the same \"reprimand\" Aston Villa were bludgeoned with earlier this season for trying to poach James Beattie? So let's see, do the tabloids think it's for financial or moral reasons that Kenyon will be asked to resign by a billionaire who amassed his fortune at a time of savage plunder in a disintegrating empire? Thought not. So, not really much of a reason for him to feel under pressure, is there? Come to think of it, not really much of a reason for him to obey the rules either. ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF After missing out on Craig Bellamy, Birmingham have signed Deportivo's sulky striker Walter Pandiani. Malcolm Glazer has distanced himself from reports that he is ready to launch a fresh takeover bid for Manchester United. And Christophe Dugarry, who scored a whopping six goals in his 31 games for Birmingham, has announced his retirement from football. * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC 1: Match of the Day (11.15pm) Last Friday, David Rogers implored Fiver readers to help him find a way to persuade his stingy boss to cough up a pay rise. Yesterday Chris Moore suggested he appeal to his employer's compassionate side, but that wouldn't get him anywhere if his boss is as merciless as today's respondents seem to be. Sky Sports 1: Live Football: Arsenal v Manchester United (7pm) \"What's David's problem?\" thunders Jimmy Klynson. \"He said he knocks off work at 5pm - he should thank his lucky stars! Football first: Match Choice (10.30pm) \"About 90% of the working population are left behind reading The Five .... I mean, slaving away until six or 7pm. He deserves a shoeing rather than a raise, the scally blagger.\" Radio Five Live: Sport on Five (7pm) Allan Jamieson, however, does at least suggest a creative, if blatantly threatening, approach. Talksport: Kick Off (7pm) \"Make sure you always keep a hammer on your desk. When someone asks why, just shrug and say 'oh, you know' and try to look like the devil. Then tell the boss you'd like to see him for a moment.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Can anyone else help David? Or those who purport to help him?
