The Construction Forestry Mining Maritime Energy Union\u2019s national secretary, Dave Noonan, told Guardian Australia the construction union was \u201cup for the fight\u201d and would do \u201ceverything we can\u201d including action in the workplace to resist the changes. The Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Steve Murphy, agreed that Australia \u201cwill see an escalation in levels of industrial disputation\u201d if bosses take advantage of provisions that cut take-home pay and rights. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is coordinating the campaign against the industrial relations omnibus bill, with a campaign, \u201cFor the Workers\u201d, asking the government to recognise the \u201cheroes of the pandemic\u201d. Unions are already reporting they have seen the most significant increase in their membership since the early days of the pandemic, as fears over work insecurity drive workers\u2019 decision making. On Thursday the attorney general, Christian Porter, denied the government was preparing to ditch the bill\u2019s most controversial provision, first revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, allowing the Fair Work Commission to approve deals that left workers worse off than the relevant award. Labor has warned the provision could result in cuts of up to of $11,000 for frontline workers due to loss of shift and overtime penalties. Porter claims such cuts would \u201cnever happen\u201d because workers would not agree and the commission would not register an agreement against the national interest. Noonan said even without that section, the bill would be a \u201crecipe for wage cuts\u201d. He cited provisions that prevent a union intervening in the commission to argue an agreement does not pass the better-off-overall test, unless it is a party to bargaining. The section will help employers pass \u201cbogus enterprise agreements\u201d without a union \u201cwatchdog\u201d, Noonan said. He said eight-year pay deals for new work sites would \u201cdeprive workers of the ability to negotiate better pay and conditions\u201d, contributing to pay cuts at a time the economy needs wages growth. Asked if the construction division could respond with an industrial campaign, Noonan replied: \u201cWe will do everything we can to protect workers wages and conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re a union that fights on the job, we\u2019ll promote our views in the media and we certainly won\u2019t be sitting back and allowing hard-won wages and conditions to be ripped off.\u201d Noonan accused the Coalition of \u201copportunistically trying to take advantage of the coronavirus\u201d. Murphy said once one employer used new provisions to seek an agreement cutting pay \u201cthe others will have to do it to compete\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all premised on the idea that to keep the business surviving, they can pay less than minimum rates of pay,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you cannot successfully run your business with minimum rates of pay it\u2019s questionable if [the enterprise] is socially useful.\u201d Murphy warned that if business goes \u201call out to make jobs less secures, cuts rights and conditions \u2013 I think we will see an escalation in levels of industrial disputation as workers fight to maintain what they\u2019ve always had\u201d. \u201cWe recognise 2020 was not the year to get everything we wanted but it\u2019s fair at least to appreciate and keep everything we already had.\u201d Jo Schofield, the national president of the United Workers Union, said the union had been fighting for job security and decent pay for years and the attacks in the bill will \u201cstrengthen our resolve\u201d. \u201cWe will appeal across the community and to the crossbench \u2026 I don\u2019t see how any right-minded politician could approve the race to the bottom.\u201d Noonan also faces a fight over the de-amalgamation of the CFMMEU super union, using new laws sought by its mining and energy union boss, Tony Maher, and passed with Labor support. Noonan said he would not \u201cwaste our time bickering with other unionists\u201d and would deal with the law now it\u2019s passed. \u201cYou deal with all sorts of bad industrial laws in this country \u2013 but it\u2019s not that often that it\u2019s unionists who asked for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
