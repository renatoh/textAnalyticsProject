The attack on women\u2019s rights was a \u201ccrisis\u201d, organised and well-resourced by very extremist groups. \u201cWe have not called it out in the same way we have other forms of extremist hate, but this is gender-based violence against women, no question,\u201d Kate Gilmore said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s torture \u2013 it\u2019s a deprivation of a right to health,\u201d she warned, pointing out that the committee of experts assigned to monitor the implementation of the nine core UN human rights instruments have each \u201cindependently declared the absolute prohibition of abortion \u2026 is against human rights\u201d. Gilmore, appointed deputy high commissioner in 2015, said the banning of abortion in some US states and the attempts by the Trump administration to remove language from key international documents was \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d. \u201cThis is a crisis. It\u2019s a crisis directed at women,\u201d she said, warning that we had not yet felt the full extent of it. Gilmore, who last week spoke at a Guardian event discussing the pushback on reproductive rights, said opposition groups \u2013 the most high profile of which are conservative, Christian organisations \u2013 were well organised and well resourced, and were ignoring evidence in their pursuit of ideological goals. \u201cIt\u2019s an assault on truth, science and universal values and norms,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts.\u201d The evidence shows that banning abortion does not stop women undergoing terminations. Instead, it pushes women to find unsafe methods. According to the Guttmacher Institute, an estimated 56 million abortions were performed annually between 2010 and 2014. Of these, 25 million were considered unsafe, putting the lives of poorer women in particular at risk. In wealthy countries, an estimated 30 women die for every 100,000 unsafe abortions but in poorer countries this rises to 220, found the World Health Organisation. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number is 520. \u201cWe have to stand with the evidence and facts and in solidarity with women, and in particular young women and minority women who are really under the gun. This doesn\u2019t affect well-off women in the same way as women with no resources, or able-bodied women the way it affects disabled women, and urban women the way it affects rural women,\u201d said Gilmore. She said that while rulings from the human rights commission have no enforcement mechanism, they can help pressure governments to act. \u201cThe human rights system doesn\u2019t have an army, but what we know is many national courts follow that jurisprudence in their own rulings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt builds up a body of law.\u201d Gilmore described meeting with a 14-year-old girl from Nicaragua which, she said, kept her focused. The girl had two children; the eldest, aged three, was the result of rape by an uncle. Nicaragua has a complete ban on abortion, so the girl was not allowed to terminate the pregnancies. \u201cShe was threatened for asking for a termination.\u201d \u201cShe told me her story, and it\u2019s always stayed with me,\u201d said Gilmore. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you because people like you make a difference, so no other girl goes through what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d That\u2019s what sits on my shoulder.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
