The defending champion also jerked his way through the drive phase, which slowed him down as Gay, Gatlin, Blake and Powell took flight. Middle Approaching 40m Bolt worked hard to catch up, his face straining with the effort. Accelerating over the next 10m, he began to pull away just as Powell reached for his hamstring and dropped back. Blake tried to go with Bolt but was fighting to get up between the Americans, Gay and Gatlin. End Bolt worked hard all the way to the finish and was less than a metre ahead of his training partner Blake at the line. The two Americans were left to compete for bronze and it could have gone either way until Gay mistimed his dip and missed out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
