Even on a busy day only a handful of guests stay in the simple apartments that overlook virgin rainforest, the Atlantic ocean and one of the world's best beaches. Aptly named, in Portuguese, Belo Monte is a beautiful hilltop farm and guesthouse at the end of a damp red-dirt track on the island of Principe, the smaller half of Africa's smallest country. The estate's colonial buildings are being slowly rescued from the jungle by its Portuguese owners, Victor and Paula. They took it on three years ago in an idealistic bid to mix organic farming and eco-tourism on a remote and undeveloped island. It is Praia Banana - Banana beach - at the farm's boundary that makes the place unique. It is a perfect bay of coconut palms, black rocks, white sand and gin-clear water, with thick rainforest tumbling down the hillside to the water's edge. On most days the farm's herd of cattle, which pays a daily visit to the shore, finds the beach empty. In a busier resort that would never be the case and Sao Tome's isolation is one of the best reasons for going there - almost nobody can find it on a map. Even though it's a fully-fledged country - with a president, parliament, anthem and airline - Sao Tome and Principe has been overlooked by most of the world. It lacks the usual wars, famines and floods that win attention for African states in Europe. The country consists of a pair of islands in the Atlantic that are 150km apart and an hour's flight from the west coast of Africa. It appears in world atlases as two dots just north of the Equator, off Gabon. The total land area is just 1000 square km and the population - around 150,000 - is less than that of a London borough. Under Portuguese rule, Sao Tome was once the world's biggest producer of cocoa, but it has fallen on hard times since it won independence in 1975. Neat orange piles of sour-tasting cacao fruit still line the sides of the few roads at harvest time but these days farmers struggle to find buyers for their cash crop and the rainforest has taken back most of the plantations and even parts of the towns. Deforestation is a problem for other countries. It's the uncontrolled reforestation of the two main islands that is the big issue here. Confusingly for visitors, the main island Sao Tome - three times the size of tiny Principe - shares its name with the national capital. One of only two real towns in the country, and site of the international airport, it's still a tiny place and offers a gentle introduction to a safe nation. Chickens scratch in the dirt outside the presidential palace and pigs wander down the main street. Dark falls with tropical speed at 6pm sharp and, apart from a few small bars serving local beer and Portuguese red wine, everything shuts. Flickering mains power comes from a big diesel generator which roars into the warm night. Early each morning, fishermen drag their dug-out canoes onto the beach at the town's waterfront and sell deep sea fish that have been caught by handlines. On a headland five minutes walk away, a seventeenth-century Portuguese castle has been turned into a melancholic national museum.There are faded photographs of colonial families and evidence of the summary justice meted out by the Portuguese to the Angolans - who were brought to work on the cocoa and coffee plantations. This form of slavery lasted into the 20th century and as late as 1953 the Portuguese army shot 1,000 striking workers - 1 in 100 of the population - as an example to others. But Sao Tome today does not feel like a brutal place. Instead it sells itself, to the small numbers of tourists who make it from Europe, on two outstanding natural assets - the sea and the forest. Eco-tourism takes place by default in Sao Tome; there are not enough international flights to tempt big tour operators and the roads are not wide enough for their coaches anyway. The smaller island, Principe, is a 45 minute trip on Air Sao Tome's single prop-driven Twin Otter plane and it has the best beaches and the most upmarket place to stay: the small but luxurious Bom Bom island resort. Just up the coast from the more informal - and cheaper - Belo Monte estate, Bom Bom offers 20 swish wooden seaside villas and a lush garden, as well as two picture-perfect, empty beaches. The food - mostly fresh fish - is as good as it is everywhere in the country, and the bar, set on a small island linked to the mainland by a wooden footbridge, looks back at an empty shore unmarked by roads or buildings. At night luminescent plankton make the sea sparkle as you swim. Look inland from the coast anywhere in the country and Sao Tome's most impressive natural feature is always visible. On both islands, the rocky summits of giant, extinct volcanoes rise steeply from the sea and are dotted with extraordinary vertical pillars reaching hundreds of metres into the clouds. Pico de Sao Tome, the summit of the main island, is 2024m above the sea. Climbing it, as only 40 or so people do each year, involves an exhausting couple of days deep in the island's untracked rainforest. However, the experience, for those able to put up with a walk that the Royal Marines could use as an endurance test, is tremendous. I did it with an inspirational guide, Luis, born on a Sao Tome plantation and a self-taught expert on the many plants and birds that are found on these islands and nowhere else. His commentary, as much as the lush palms, ferns and forest trees, made the effort of pulling myself to the summit up slippery mud slopes possible. And it was muddy. Sao Tome, in the tropics, is a warm and humid place and though it is usually sunny on the coast - especially in the June to July dry season - it rains every day somewhere in the country and often across all of it. The mountains inland are covered in mist and the rainforest lives up to both parts of its name - sending rivers to the sea that look big enough to have covered countries, rather than a few miles. As they head for the sea, over waterfalls and through forests, the rivers pass the decaying hulks of the ro\u00e7as that dot the islands. These are plantation houses built by the Portuguese and abandoned by them in 1975. Some were once luxurious mini-palaces deep in the forest, with elegant dining rooms, elaborate stable blocks, bullrings and their own steam railways. Now, most are empty apart from former workers who have stayed on in the ruins. A few, however, have been rescued and offer basic accommodation, with jungle sounds and sights making up for the lack of running water, electricity or window glass. There are sufficient places to stay and eat on the islands to make a two week holiday easy to fill. There is a good travel agent in the capital - Navateur - to organise it all, but getting about is still enough of a challenge to make visitors feel like travellers not tourists. Partly this is because everyone speaks Portuguese - not a language easy to understand or pronounce at first acquaintance, although plenty of French and some English are also spoken. The roads and cars are rundown and parts of the islands are reachable only by canoe, but the advantages of a small country come to the fore in these conditions. Nowhere is more than a day's trip from the capital; the 20 hour bus rides typical of travel in the rest of Africa are impossible. Not many people come to Sao Tome but, as they leave from an airport that still has decaying 1950s propeller planes parked at the end of the runway, few of those that have can be glad to depart. Africa, Portugal and natural splendour combine in an obscure country that deserves to find friends. Getting there The only regular direct flight from Europe to Sao Tome is operated by TAP Air Portugal which flies weekly from Lisbon for around US$1100. Air Sao Tome and Air Gabon both fly small planes twice a week from Libreville, Gabon, with connections on Air Gabon and Air France from Europe. A Portuguese charter airline, Euro-Atlantic Airways, currently operates fortnightly flights from Lisbon to Sao Tome for euro 699 return. Getting around Transport is easy to arrange. Main routes are served by regular shared taxis and buses from the marketplace in Sao Tome. Inland routes require fourwheel drive cars, which can be hired or provided by the Navatur travel agent (navequatur@cstome.net). The walking route to the summit of Pico de Sao Tome is not clear and must be done with a guide. Navatur can arrange for their guide to lead the climb. Good boots and a tent are essential. Places to stay A two-person studio at Belo Monte on Principe costs euro50 a night and can be booked by emailing belomonte@hotmail.com. The Bom Bom Island resort on Principe costs US$175 per person per night including all food and can be booked on bombom@cstome.net. A full list of accommodation in the country can be found on the web: Sao Tome hotels Money Sao Tome is not a cheap destination and visitors should expect to spend around US$50-100 each a day. Prices are often marked in US$ or euros but most places also accept the national currency, the Dobra. There are currently around 14,000 Dobra to the pound sterling. There is only one bank in the country, which offers cash advances in Dobra on Visa credit cards, but dollars and euro can be changed legally on the street and in most restaurants and hotels. Credit cards are accepted only in two upmarket hotels. Documents All visitors to Sao Tome require visas which are available on arrival at the airport for US$ 50 per person. There is a departure tax of US$ 20 which must be paid in cash. Health Malaria is rife on the islands and visitors should take care to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes at dawn and dusk as well as taking a suitable anti-malarial treatment.
