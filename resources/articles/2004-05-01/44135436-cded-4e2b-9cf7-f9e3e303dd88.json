It was no joke for Surrey, as Ed Joyce and Jamie Dalrymple shared a partnership of 298 which set a fifth-wicket record for either side in this fixture. Dalrymple's contribution summed up Surrey's current fortunes, as the 22-year-old is playing only because the Middlesex captain Andrew Strauss has been called away by England. This is his first full season since graduating and this was a hugely impressive maiden championship century, with only 18 more needed today to add another double century to his unbeaten 263 in the University Match at Lord's last year. He has faced only 234 balls and hit 29 boundaries, four in a single over from James Ormond after tea, growing in confidence and aggression while the left-handed Joyce proceeded unobtrusively but stylishly to his 123. However, Surrey had only themselves to blame, or more specifically their former captain Adam Hollioake, who dropped a straightforward second-slip chance offered by Dalrymple off Ormond on 41. Ormond had taken three wickets and Martin Bicknell one to reduce Middlesex to 62 for four in the first hour and Dalrymple's dismissal shortly after lunch would have ended his stand with Joyce on 82, with Surrey still 215 ahead. Despite another excellent spell from the admirable Bicknell, and the odd lbw appeal against Dalrymple when he flicked across his front pad, neither batsman offered another chance, leaving Hollioake plenty of time to reflect on his second expensive miss in consecutive matches. Joyce stroked 15 fours in his 225-ball innings, a necessary one after failing to convert promising starts into even a half-century until he reached three figures last week. \"I enjoy batting with him, we get on well,\" said Dalrymple, adding that he had spent 10 days at an Indian academy with Joyce during the winter. \"I had a rough time last year, it was difficult because I was away doing my exams.\" Surrey's bowling has lacked penetration all season and the lack of support for Bicknell and Ormond was highlighted yesterday by the absence of Saqlain Mushtaq and Azhar Mahmood, both injured. They hope to sign a replacement for Saqlain, out for at least a month with his knee problem, by the weekend, with India's Zaheer Khan the favourite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
