Lukaku became Everton\u2019s leading goalscorer in Europe on Thursday when his seventh Europa League goal secured a 2-1 win over Dynamo Kyiv. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team rallied impressively in the last-16 first leg but only after a poor start that exposed the frustrations among the home support. Everton are six points above the relegation zone having won one league game since 15 December and Lukaku admits the Dynamo levels must continue from the outset against Newcastle to improve that sorry statistic. He said: \u201cYou learn a lot when your back\u2019s against the wall. But a relegation battle? Really? I don\u2019t want to take it that far and say that. It\u2019s been the first time in my career I have been looking down but I don\u2019t want to look down, I want to look up. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like this. You know every game your back is against the wall. \u201cWe had a good performance against Dynamo and so I will tell the guys: \u2019What we did here we have to do on Sunday as well.\u2019 Sunday is Newcastle, a different type of team, a different kind of football, a lot of physical stuff. But we have to do like we have in Europe \u2013 play our game, dictate the tempo, because when we have lost it is often because we have let other teams dictate to us. It\u2019s a very big game but I think we\u2019re ready for it. \u201cI believe in the team and I believe in the manager. I believe in him. I believe his philosophy and the way he\u2019s thinking, although I understand the fans expect us to win all the time and want us to give our maximum, I agree with that. But we have to do it together.\u201d Lukaku overtook Fred Pickering as Everton\u2019s leading scorer in European competition, a record that had stood since the 1960s, and has 16 goals in total this season. The club\u2019s \u00a328m record signing added: \u201cMaybe this was the season that I needed \u2013 to feel how it is to be the main man and stuff like that. I think I have a respectable amount of goals \u2013 the same as last season now \u2013 but I want to get better and make the team better. It\u2019s been a good learning experience but I don\u2019t want to learn at this time, I want to win. But I have learned a lot this season, especially mentally.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
