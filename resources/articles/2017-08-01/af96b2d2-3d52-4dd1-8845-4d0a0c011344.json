The singer-songwriter not only won the court case, proving that she was groped by Denver DJ David Mueller, but she also pledged to give money to help other sexual assault victims defend themselves. There are still whiffs in some quarters of this being a rather insignificant \u201csex scandal\u201d. \u201cMan touches young woman\u2019s bottom\u201d \u2013 wow, hold the front page. This is especially so in the entertainment industry, where sexism is practically the universal language. However, it\u2019s not just about the groping. Even if it were just about the groping, no one is allowed to go around randomly touching people up. But a case like this isn\u2019t just about what is done, it\u2019s about people thinking that they can get away with what might be conceived as almost a kind of sexual petty crime. It says everything that Mueller wasn\u2019t even some major powerful industry player and yet still he felt entitled to stick his hand up a complete stranger\u2019s skirt. Even now, he\u2019s complaining that his career has been ruined, as if his wandering hands weren\u2019t the problem; rather, in his view, it\u2019s Swift who has the issue (a wandering posterior?). Sometimes, this is how these things play out \u2013 someone trying to get away with an inappropriate action, in such a fashion (fleeting, casual) that the affected person ends up worrying that they would be making a fuss if they complained. In this way, Swift\u2019s actions benefited any woman who has ever been weirdly mauled and had her space invaded by some opportunistic creep, with delusions of attractiveness. Beyond the specifics of this case, this was also about smashing the sense of entitlement that makes lechers presume that they can get away with taking big and \u2013 crucially \u2013 small liberties."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
