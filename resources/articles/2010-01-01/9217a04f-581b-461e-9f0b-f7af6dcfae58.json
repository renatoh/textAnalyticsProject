Multiple media sources in the southern state were confirming last night that Woods, who has not been seen in public since 27 November when he crashed his SUV just yards from his Florida home, has checked into the Pine Grove Behavioral Health and Addiction Services clinic in Hattiesburg. According to its website, the clinic specialises in treating people suffering from sexual addiction. In the aftermath of the crash, a number of women came forward claiming to have had a relationship with Woods, who is married and has two children. The golfer subsequently issued a statement admitting to \"infidelities\" and stated his intention to become a better husband, father and person. He also said he would be taking an \"indefinite\" break from golf. Treatment at Pine Grove lasts for an average of six weeks. A spokeswomen for the clinic declined to comment on Woods last night, and the sheriff's office in Hattiesburg refused to confirm or deny reports that local police had stepped up security at the clinic following the arrival of a new celebrity patient. However, WJTV television news in Jackson, Mississippi, reported that employees and visitors at the clinic have confirmed to its reporters that Woods is there. Meanwhile, one eyewitness said she saw Woods arriving at the Hattiesburg-Bobby L. Chain Municipal Airport on Monday night. \"He didn't look happy or sad, just straight,\" student Adrian Smith said. \"He looked around and got in the driver's seat. He didn't seem to be in a hurry. He just walked around the car and got in. He sat there for a few seconds, then just drove off. His luggage was already in the car.\" Since the scandal about his private life broke, Woods has been dropped by several of his corporate sponsors, including the management consultancy Accenture and the US telecommunications company AT&amp;T. Reportedly the first billionaire athlete in sport, the golfer is estimated to be on course to lose as much as 40% of his $100 million annual income as a result of the bad publicity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
