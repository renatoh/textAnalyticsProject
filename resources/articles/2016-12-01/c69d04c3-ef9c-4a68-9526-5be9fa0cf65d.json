But the convincing win expected given the teams\u2019 respective league positions \u2013 Partick are bottom of the table with just three wins \u2013 did not materialise. Partick might have come away with something had they taken their chances. Scott Sinclair scored the only goal in the 17th minute at Celtic Park, his 11th of the season. The former Chelsea and Manchester City forward was quickest on to Liam Henderson\u2019s low free-kick across the area and scooped a smart first-time effort past Tomas Cerny in the Partick goal. For Celtic\u2019s manager, Brendan Rodgers, the major plus apart from the win was the display of the 18-year-old Calvin Miller on his debut. Miller is a forward but he played at left-back and Rodgers compared him to Ryan Bertrand. \u201cI was delighted for a young player who has just moved position,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he did very well and he wants to learn and develop. I did a similar thing with Ryan Bertrand when I was at Chelsea.\u201d Partick had their moments and Ade Azeez drew a save from Craig Gordon just before half-time and proved a threat throughout with his pace and power but Celtic could have added to their lead in the second half. Patrick Roberts twice went close just after the break, with his first effort from close range brilliantly saved by Cerny and his second attempt zipping over the Partick bar. Cerny was called into action again midway through the half, denying Sinclair a second as he broke through on goal and then doing well to turn a Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 effort behind. Stuart Armstrong also tested the former Czech under-21 international goalkeeper with 10 minutes to go. Despite their failure to add a second, Celtic held on comfortably for the three points that moved them further away from the chasing pack led by Rangers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
