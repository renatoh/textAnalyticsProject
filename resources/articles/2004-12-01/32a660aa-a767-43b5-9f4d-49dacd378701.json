City have already dismissed a Rovers' offer of \u00a32.2m as \"derisory\" and have repeated that the Wales international midfielder is not for sale. The Birmingham City chairman David Gold also insisted were Savage to be sold it would not be to a club like Blackburn who were similarly involved in a relegation battle. Hughes appears reluctant to take no for an answer and said: \"The clubs are talking. If something happens I'll be grateful, but we probably need a quick decision.\" However, a Birmingham spokesman countered Hughes' comments last night: \"The two clubs are not still in the process of talking about the deal. \"The offer that has been made to Birmingham by Blackburn for Robbie Savage is considered by the club to be 'derisory' and 'wholly unacceptable'. \"The 'quick decision' that Mark Hughes has requested today has already been received by Blackburn - this was a definitive 'no' when the offer was first tabled. And, finally, Robbie Savage is not for sale.\" Meanwhile Rovers have loaned Alex Bruce, the son of the Birmingham City manager Steve, to Oldham Athletic for a month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
