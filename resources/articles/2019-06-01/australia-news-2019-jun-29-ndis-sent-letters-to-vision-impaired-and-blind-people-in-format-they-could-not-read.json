But since the national disability insurance scheme began its rollout, blind and vision impaired participants have received vital correspondence \u2013 such as their support plans \u2013 in the form of regular letters, or as PDFs that do not accomodate a screen reader. \u201cThe plans were simply being sent to people through the MyGov portal as a secure PDF file,\u201d the acting chief executive at Blind Citizens Australia, Rikki Chaplin, told Guardian Australia. \u201cScreen readers cannot read secure PDF files so some people were receiving print copies of plans, and they were braille readers. Naturally, they can\u2019t read those.\u201d The problem is particularly severe for those who self-manage their support plans. A key tenet of the NDIS is that it is intended to help participants with their independence; yet Chaplin said people were waiting from a \u201cfew months to a year\u201d to get an accessible version of their plan. \u201cBy that time the plan [might] have expired,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have gone through it with the support co-ordinator, but if you\u2019re self-managing a plan you need to be able to look at how much money you\u2019ve got left.\u201d In July, the National Disability Insurance Agency will roll out new measures, which Blind Citizens Australia believes will fix the problem. The agency will introduce an automated system so people can receive correspondence in their preferred format, be that large font, audio, e-text or braille. Chaplin was disappointed the NDIA had taken so long to respond to their concerns. \u201cWe first raised this probably around three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do find it very disappointing that we\u2019ve had to fight this long for the agency whose job it is to take care of the needs of people with disability to understand what we feel is a very basic, fundamental concept. \u201cWhile we\u2019re disappointed, we do have to congratulate them for coming to the table.\u201d The NDIA had also introduced measures this year to improve the accessibility of its website. The website maintains an A rating from the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, set by the World Wide Web Consortium. An NDIA spokeswoman said the agency was committed to ensuring \u201cinformation is accessible, and delivered to NDIS participants in their preferred format\u201d. \u201cAs a result of consultation with participants, their families and carers, the NDIA will begin testing an automated process for requesting alternative formats,\u201d she said. The improved access for blind and visioned impaired people came as the federal government struck an important deal with the states and territories on Friday, under which the NDIS will fund disability-related health needs, including for swallowing and respiratory issues, and continence aids. The NDIA had been reluctant \u2013 or refused \u2013 to finance the health aids, which it had said were not its responsibility. Guardian Australia reported this month that a crucial ruling at the administrative appeals tribunal had cast doubt on the agency\u2019s ability to refuse to finance the aids in question. The federal NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, was reportedly offering a $90m-a-year federal funding support package to the states."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
