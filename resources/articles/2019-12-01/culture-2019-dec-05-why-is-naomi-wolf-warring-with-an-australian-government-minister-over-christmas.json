Let\u2019s go back to 1991: Angus Taylor, who is now Australia\u2019s somewhat embattled energy minister, was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. According to his maiden speech to parliament in 2013, it was there he first came across  \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. \u201cA young Naomi Wolf lived a couple of doors down the corridor,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral graduate students, mostly from the north-east of the US, decided we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended. I was astounded.\u201d They sound fun! Did they succeed? In his speech Taylor said he and other fellow \u201cmainstream\u201d opponents \u201cpushed back hard\u201d and won the battle for Christmas against what he said were \u201cshrill elitist voices who insist that they know what is best for people who are not remotely like them\u201d. The anecdote was repeated in embellished form in a 2014 profile of Taylor in the Australian Financial Review (whose reporter has since offered to update the article if Wolf wanted to comment). There\u2019s a problem with this story though. Never! Yes! Naomi Wolf says she wasn\u2019t living at Oxford in 1991. \u201cI was a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf has said. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d Why are we hearing about it now, six years after the speech? That section of Taylor\u2019s speech was resurfaced on Twitter by a Labor MP this week, where Wolf saw it. She\u2019s now on the warpath, and has accused Taylor of antisemitic dogwhistling, and demanded a correction. How has he responded? Taylor says he never suggested she was warring against Christmas or that she was among those who were, but stands by the claim that he saw her at Oxford. Wolf isn\u2019t letting up, so on Thursday morning (Australian time), she called his office. Surprisingly, since it was past midnight in Canberra, a staffer answered and the resulting phone call went for almost 30 minutes. Wolf tweeted some key quotes before uploading the entire recording to YouTube. What did they talk about for 30 minutes in the middle of the Canberra night? Wolf repeatedly asked Taylor\u2019s office to issue a public correction to say she was not at Oxford at the same time as him and that she was not part of a group of people campaigning against Christmas. According to her tweets, the staffer \u2013 who seemingly didn\u2019t realise he was actually talking to Naomi Wolf at first \u2013 suggested that maybe, actually, she had been at Oxford in 1991. Awkward. So what happens next?Wolf posts the whole lot on Twitter, just in time for Australia\u2019s morning news cycle and everyone\u2019s gone a bit mad over it. She\u2019s still accusing Taylor of dogwhistling and doesn\u2019t want to speak to him personally \u2013 she wants a public correction. She\u2019s still seeking a correction from Taylor, and a bunch of people have backed her up that she was not in Oxford in 1991, including a friend who stayed on her couch in New York, and another woman who went to one of Wolf\u2019s events on her Australian book tour. How did Taylor react to the call? Taylor came out swinging in question time at Parliament House on Thursday and demanded she apologise. He was emphatic he met Wolf while he was at university, saying: \u201cOf course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there.\u201d He then called on her to apologise for her \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d attack, saying: \u201cHer accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
