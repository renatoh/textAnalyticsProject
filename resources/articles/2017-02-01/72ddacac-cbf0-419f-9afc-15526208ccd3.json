Sitting alongside Donald Trump and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, Ivanka made only brief public remarks at the top of the meeting, pointing to the \u201cunique challenges\u201d faced by women in the workforce. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be here and really looking forward to hearing from each of you,\u201d Ivanka told the group of about a dozen business leaders, \u201cas we think about the unique challenges that entrepreneurs, women in the workforce, female small business owners are confronted with each and every day, and as we think [about] how we level the playing field for this generation and for the next.\u201d The appearance came against the backdrop of a searing controversy over the impact of Ivanka\u2019s newfound prominence in the White House on her commercial brand. On Monday, Burlington Stores joined other retailers in choosing not to carry Ivanka\u2019s apparel on its website, according to a report in Business Insider. And over the weekend, Sears Holdings, the parent company of US retail stores Sears and Kmart, pulled 31 Trump-branded products from its website. Although Ivanka holds no formal role in the White House, she has frequently participated in official events with the president while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to the president. She sat next to Trudeau at Monday\u2019s roundtable, which established a new taskforce called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. Donald Trump, who sat across from his daughter, said Ivanka \u201cis very much involved\u201d in issues pertaining to women in the workplace. Ivanka\u2019s proximity to the administration has nonetheless come under increased scrutiny as her brand has begun to fall under the weight of her father\u2019s political profile. Earlier this month, Nordstrom became the first major retailer to stop selling Ivanka\u2019s merchandise, citing a decline in sales. Luxury department store Neiman Marcus soon followed suit and dropped Ivanka\u2019s jewelry line. Sales of Ivanka\u2019s products at Nordstrom had dropped more than 70% in the weeks before the 8 November election, according to internal data reported by the Wall Street Journal. Following Nordstrom\u2019s decision, Donald Trump and the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, publicly denounced the retailer for what they dubbed a political decision. \u201cMy daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom,\u201d Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Spicer meanwhile called Nordstrom\u2019s move a \u201cdirect attack\u201d on the president\u2019s policies and Ivanka\u2019s name. Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s senior counselor, arguably lit the biggest fire by using a televised interview on Fox News, taped from the White House, to promote Ivanka\u2019s merchandise. Conway\u2019s conduct was met with considerable backlash, prompting a letter from the House oversight committee recommending she be disciplined if necessary. The dust-up over Ivanka\u2019s brand has, in many ways, proved to be an early microcosm of the looming conflict of interest questions surrounding Donald Trump and his family\u2019s empire as he governs from the Oval Office. Ivanka said she would take a leave of absence from her business when her father was sworn in as president. \u201cI will take a formal leave of absence from the Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand,\u201d Ivanka wrote on 11 January. \u201cI will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company.\u201d But according to ProPublica, she was still listed as running Trump businesses on at least some active liquor licenses associated with the family\u2019s properties. Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush, said by acting as a de facto government employee, Ivanka was running the risk of mixing official business with her commercial enterprises. \u201cIf she wants to sit in as a woman business leader, I guess she can,\u201d Painter said. \u201cBut she can\u2019t be getting into stuff at the White House that affects her businesses \u2026 She better stay an outsider.\u201d Painter said the Trump administration\u2019s attack on companies that chose to no longer do business with Ivanka, such as Nordstrom, was the most concerning aspect of the saga. \u201cWhat Kellyanne Conway did was shilling for the Ivanka Trump brand from the White House \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut much worse is trying to use the force of the government, the power of the government, to intimidate private markets for dissidents who don\u2019t choose to do business with a member of the president\u2019s family.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where the attacks on Nordstrom were particularly reprehensible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
