In the corner sat his wife, Ffion, playing noughts and crosses with a 10-year-old. She was bored. Yesterday morning and another day of campaigning for the leader of the opposition. He was bowled some questions on Europe, schools and stealth taxes. Ffion tried to flumox her new friend, Alistair, by putting three crosses in a row. On the surface this should have been Hague's best week. John Prescott punched a voter and wiped the coverage of Labour's manifesto launch off the front pages of the newspapers. Jack Straw was heckled at the Police Federation. Sharron Storer berated Tony Blair for the treatment her partner had received at the hands of the NHS. Cabinet members readily admit that last week was certainly 'wobbly' for Labour. So why isn't Hague's smile a little broader? The team around him a little happier? Because of one problem that is causing furrowed brows at Conservative Central Office. As far as the polls are concerned, the Tories are flatlining. They cannot budge the public. It is confounding election thinking. Presentationally, the Government had a bad week but its support is rising. The Conservatives are stuck at between 30 and 33 per cent in the polls, which give the same figures month after month. Last weekend's polls revealed that since 1997 Conservative support has changed by exactly 1 per cent. Downwards. Analysts who pore over the figures are asking why. Have we entered a new era where the political orthodoxy is actually New Labour rather than Old Conservative? Why haven't the attacks on crime, on asylum, on the economy, worked? How has political debate become more within the Labour Party than between Labour and the Tories. In the last seven days of the campaign Hague will push Europe and saving the pound as the only issue that matters. It is the Tory party's last trick. In Conservative Central Office one name is mentioned with approving nods. George W. Bush, the man who wrested a lead from the centre-left party, and won the US presidency when everyone told him he would lose and lose big. So the Tories are copying from their Republican friends across the Atlantic. Sebastian Coe, Hague's chief of staff, hired a set of helicopters before the election campaign started. It allows Hague to dart around the country, moving rapidly from issue to issue, never getting bogged down in detail and crucially avoiding the morning press conference at which the frontmen of all three parties are ritually savaged by the press. Bush did the same. It's meant to make the leader look dynamic, forceful, his own man. But now senior Conservatives are worried that it's not working. The public is asking why Hague isn't doing more press conferences, answering more questions. Is he running scared? While Bush managed to tap into a dislike of Bill Clinton by pushing tax cuts, Hague is battling against the spectre of the last Conservative government, still a bitter memory in many people's minds. And then there is the issue of Hague himself. The public might grumble about Labour's handling of crumbling schools and hospitals, they even express interest in some Tory policies - asylum has been a favourite on the doorsteps - but they draw the line at voting for Hague. 'It is a definite issue and there's no point pretending it isn't,' says one senior Tory. Another senior backbencher argues that the slickness of the campaign is costing votes: it irritates those who are still not ready to forgive the Tories. 'The more people hear us, the more they don't like us,' he said. There is one glimmer of hope - the 'shy Tories' - those too embarrassed to tell pollsters who they support. On the third floor of the Tories' Smith Square headquarters, the call centre staff manning the bank of 60 phones are now trying urgently to find them. Early returns from the 180 most marginal seats show that about a fifth of voters are still undecided, and of those who were 'don't knows' in March but have now made up their minds, around 60 per cent have swung back to the Tories. The canvassers are focussing on what they call 'possible Conservatives': Tory voters who defected in 1997; 'don't knows' who appear Tory-inclined; and previous Tory voters who are unsure. Their report concludes that 'almost all of these possible Conservatives who have been contacted have firmed up in our favour'. So why aren't they telling the pollsters? Shadow Agriculture Minister Tim Yeo said last week that it was still 'not cool' to admit to voting Tory: others say privately that is even more true when the party is so closely identified with hardline right-wing ideas. At just past 7am yesterday, Peter Mandelson eased into the back seat of his government-issue car and began the short drive to Middlesbrough from his home in Hartlepool. He was on his way to Eston school where Radio 4's Today programme was being broadcast. Mandelson was the main guest. What he said revealed the thinking at the heart of the Labour Party. Mandelson is a man in regular contact with the Prime Minister. When he wrote in The Observer two week's ago about the need for 'vision and ambition' from the Government, Blair used almost exactly the same words in a speech the following week. When Mandelson said that spin had to replaced by substance, Blair admitted on an interview two days later that 'spin was an issue'. 'We need to bring about a much more profound change in the way in which we organise and deliver our public services,' said Mandelson as members of the Socialist Alliances heckled him from the back of the school hall. 'Has the National Health Service been transformed as a result of that additional expenditure and those resources? No. Does a lot more still need to be done in the second term of the Labour government? Yes.' On Tuesday, Blair makes his big set-piece speech on public services. He will admit that the improvements have not been as rapid as he would have liked and there are still huge problems in health and education. Sharron Storer, the woman from Birmingham who became an instant election star when she berated Blair because her partner had received such bad NHS treatment, has hit home at Millbank. Whatever Labour says about record investment in hospitals, the public are still angry. Blair's speech and Mandelson's comments all feed into the same issue. Labour is its own worst enemy. It has to be. The Conservative opposition are not offering enough problems. So Labour has to offer its own. Ever since the electoral disaster of 1983, Labour has been moving its political appeal to encompass issues previously thought as being the preserve of the right - the economy, crime, asylum, tax. These have been bolted onto the traditional Labour territories of public services, tackling poverty and unemployment. One backbench MP said: 'Politically we have taken over, not just the centre, but over onto the right as well. Everyone is saying that the Tories need to stake out some new territory. Well, there isn't any new territory, we've got it all.' Over the last seven days there has been a step change in the mood at Millbank. A week ago Anji Hunter, Blair's private secretary and one of his closest political confidants, was telling colleagues that she feared a rogue poll would show Hague fighting back. That, she concluded, might not be such a bad thing as it would motivate Labour supporters to vote. But as the campaign enters its third week there is no sign that Hunter's nervousness, shared by Alastair Campbell, is justified. Every night Philip Gould, Blair's personal pollster, receives pages of polling evidence from the firm NOP, which is paid to undertake polls for the party. The party has done three polls since the campaign began. Every indicator is up. On the question of whether on balance the country is going 'in the right direction' (Gould's 'magic question' which he believes really reveals what the public is thinking) the number of people who say yes, rather than no, has led by 3 per cent, then 8 per cent and now 19 per cent. On education, tax, the economy and education Gould says more people think Labour have the better policies as the campaign progresses. Over the last seven days confidence has grown. Before the campaign began Downing Street feared that attacks on crime, Europe, tax and the state of public services could make their campaign suffer. There have been wobbles but no resultant lift for the Tories. Labour has suddenly realised that it can lose a few battles but they will never lose the war. 'The key to this whole campaign has been getting the economic message across and saying that the Tories would ruin it by bribing you with tax cuts,' said a Millbank campaign team member. Douglas Alexander, Gordon Brown's right-hand man of the campaign, describes it as the key 'election driver', issues which actually affect the way people vote: economic stability, tax and public services. Whatever John 'Two Jabs' Prescott gets up to, those fundamentals stay the same, he has told colleagues. At Chequers tomorrow, Blair is having his only day off of the campaign. It's his son's first birthday and there will be a family party to celebrate. People will stand around trying not to talk about the election. But, whisper it more and more loudly, Millbank knows it is in the bag.
