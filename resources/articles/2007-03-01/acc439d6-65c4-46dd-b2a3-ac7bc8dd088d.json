The commissioner general for atomic energy, Fortunat Lumu, was detained on Tuesday along with an aide. Congo's state prosecutor, Tshimanga Mukeba, said Mr Lumu was being questioned about the disappearance of unspecified quantities of uranium in recent years. Mr Mukeba said Mr Lumu was suspected of \"orchestrating illicit contracts to produce and sell uranium\" but he did not name the alleged buyers. Le Phare newspaper reported that about 100 bars of uranium had disappeared from the small experimental reactor, the oldest nuclear facility in Africa. The uranium produced by the reactor in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, is enriched but not to weapons grade, although it could be used in a \"dirty bomb\" to spread radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency and foreign governments have expressed concern about lax security at the plant, which the US has tried to get closed for a number of years. Two years ago the Congolese government denied reports that uranium was shipped to Iran. In 2000, Newsweek reported that a Kenyan middleman attempted to sell Congolese uranium to Saddam Hussein but the Iraqi leader was under too much international scrutiny to buy it. The IAEA has criticised standards at the site, which is often left unguarded and is protected only by a low fence and rickety gate. Although the reactor has been on standby for nine years, there are 98 bars of enriched uranium stored at the site, submerged in a pool underneath a padlocked metal grate or in the reactor. Two uranium rods disappeared from the facility in the late 1970s, one of which is believed to have been found in 1998 on its way to the Middle East via the mafia. The other was never recovered. The nuclear facility was founded in 1958 with help from the US because the then Belgian Congo provided the uranium used in the atom bombs dropped on Japan. It also handles uranium mined in the south of the country for export. In the chaos of the past decade of foreign invasion and civil war in Congo, illegal mining has boomed with thousands of Congolese make a living from using shovels and their bare hands to hack it from the earth. The IAEA has also told the Congolese of its fears that an accident at the facility could spread radiation into Kinshasa and contaminate the water supply. Agency officials have been particularly worried that the reactor is built in an area known for subsidence. One of the facility's walls was pierced by an unidentified metal projectile seven years ago that was variously identified as part of a missile or having fallen from a plane. Congo's nuclear scientists are optimistic, however. They say they hope to get the reactor working again soon for a range of uses from medical research to mine prospecting. Last year, the commission signed an agreement with a British firm, Brinkley Mining, for the nuclear facility to be used in prospecting for uranium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
