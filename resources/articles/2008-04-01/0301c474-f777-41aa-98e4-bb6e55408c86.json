So at last month's London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival I was, officially, \"outed\" as a heterosexual. I found myself bringing the female point of view to a panel of men discussing the themes of A Jihad for Love, a brave documentary about gay and proud followers of Islam. The festival organisers had searched, without success, for a lesbian Muslim to go public on the panel. When the request landed on a web group of artists and writers that I subscribe to, it brought an immediate response from one woman, who fired off: \"How bizarre ... this is a contradiction in itself and a very unrealistic request! If the practising Muslim woman is a lesbian she would be stoning herself to death according to her belief in Islam.\" This unleashed a heated debate that was emblematic of the documentary. How do Muslim homosexuals reconcile their sexual and Islamic identities, the latter of which brands them as sinners? Some, of course, choose to forgo their Muslim faith, but Muhsin Hendricks, the South African gay imam in the documentary, whose family have always been spiritual leaders in their conservative Muslim community in Cape Town, found he was so embedded in his religious identity that he could not possibly choose to live without it. He argues that Muslims need to become more intellectually creative and less literalist in their reading of Islam as the current Islamic rulings on homosexuality are rooted in a 7th-century context. Some Muslims will argue that our 7th-century religion remains untouched by reinterpretation and therein lies its purity - it is the word of God, and is therefore perfect for all times. But if Muslims are to survive in a fast-changing world, then purity must make some room for reality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
