It was not a great speech, but it commanded the respect of an audience happy to move on from Tony Blair's deft theatricality. It was New Labour. But Brown is Ibsen to Blair's Chekhov, stern and masculine, a father figure. So there were no jokes, no attacks on David Cameron or Ming Campbell, let alone on Alex Salmond, whose strength in Mr Brown's backyard dampens euphoric election talk for Westminster. Not that there was any mention of the election option in Mr Brown's speech to Labour's Bournemouth conference: nothing so vulgar for the national leader. It was there, of course, bubbling away below the podium. The option remains open - though surely not for much longer. Mr Brown spoke as a British nationalist, praising the moral fibre demonstrated during this summer's mishaps as proof that British resolve can overcome all difficulties - to the point where this small island can still \"lead the global economy\" as it did for the century before 1870. Nothing wrong with that: national myths are comforting, especially when harnessed to the moral rectitude of the late Reverend John Brown. His posthumous influence on his son, the prime minister, is as great as Alfred Roberts's corner-shop philosophy was on Margaret Thatcher: the conscience of provincial non-conformity, still present in a secular society. Consequently Mr Brown Jnr presents himself as a practical man offering practical solutions. He declared Labour to be \"the party of aspiration and community, not just occupying but shaping and expanding the centre ground\". That is what political centre grounds are supposed to do: morph in response to applied pressure. Mr Brown devoted far more time yesterday to his vision of a society where every child has a decent chance than he did to the banking crisis. It won him rounds of applause from an audience light on bankers. But how did yesterday's speech pass muster by the practicality test? If the speech lacked a clear narrative theme - simple tunes voters can whistle - it was also light on the means by which noble aims will be achieved in a Britain more selfish than the one Mr Brown invoked. There were several passages about personal and community responsibility - the \"discipline, respect and responsibility\" young Gordon absorbed as a boy growing up in Kirkcaldy - and remedies offered which will punish those who transgress. For those who play by the rules there will be new youth clubs, paid for with cash from dormant bank accounts. What was inevitably missing was any reflective worry that Labour policies may contribute to the very problems which then prompt more Labour policies. Immigration was one such issue, rising again as a source of public anxiety, yet only lightly touched as a problem of border control and skills, not crime or pressure on services. It is one more reason why Mr Brown may hesitate to fire the election gun. It is a barn door even the Tories could hit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
