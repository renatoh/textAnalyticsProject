The association of staff shareholders said it would not ratify the actions of the boards on January 27 after a year marred by the controversial sale of the mobile phone business and allegations of corruption at the company, Europe's biggest engineering group. \"Unfortunately, the last fiscal year was marked by three especially unpleasant events,\" the shareholders say in a proposal to the AGM, rejecting agenda items ratifying the acts of the boards during the year to the end of September. The letter refers to the bankruptcy filing of Siemens' former mobile phones unit, BenQ; a proposed 30% salary increase for senior executives, and a criminal investigation into suspected embezzlement, bribery and tax evasion. The association said short-term shareholder value had taken priority over sustainable corporate policy. \"This policy, the BenQ debacle, an unreasonable salary increase for the managing board and the corruption allegations have resulted in a loss of confidence in the company that simply cannot be tolerated,\" the proposal reads. State prosecutors in Munich said last week that suspicions of fraud at Siemens' fixed-phone division had hardened after the initial stage of their investigation into whether \u20ac200m (\u00a3136m) of Siemens money was transferred into foreign accounts to use as bribes. Siemens is examining \u20ac420m of payments that were booked as consultant fees over the past seven years. Twelve former employees are being held in custody over the allegations. Wolfgang Kreuzer, a solicitor for one of the suspects, was sued for libel by Siemens yesterday after stating that the firm's compliance unit was informed about bribery cases and supported the system of secret accounts. Klaus Kleinfeld, the chief executive, Heinrich von Pierer, the supervisory board's chairman and Siemens' former chief executive, and Joe Kaeser, the chief financial officer, repeatedly stated that they were not involved in or informed about any slush money payments or secret accounts. But the staff shareholders are holding the two boards directly responsible, stating that their reaction to early allegations was too slow. \"In spite of clear indications of a violation of the company's code of ethics as early as in 2005 and in the spring of 2006, the managing board did not act in a consistent and timely manner,\" they wrote. Mr Kleinfeld said he learned about a suspicious bank account in Switzerland in January this year. This latest loss of confidence adds to earlier calls by private investor associations for Mr von Pierer to resign as chairman of the supervisory board. He was chief executive from 1992 to 2005. Private investors own 18.8% of Siemens stock. A poll among shareholders this month showed that many German investors had lost confidence in the chief executive. Only 28% of investors believe Mr Kleinfeld can increase the firm's value, compared with 52% three months ago. Mr Kleinfeld issued his letter to shareholders yesterday but did not react to the allegations against his board, only mentioning the corruption probe in a short paragraph. In the report of the supervisory board, Mr von Pierer indicated that cases of bribery could have taken place in other units of the company too. The board has \"retained the law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton to investigate whether similar situations have arisen at any other Siemens group\", he wrote. It was reported last week that prosecutors were investigating whether new secret accounts were established after accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein were discovered in 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
