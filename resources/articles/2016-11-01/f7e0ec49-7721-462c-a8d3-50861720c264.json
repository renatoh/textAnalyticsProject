Edward Bastian said in an internal memo that the airline was also refunding the cost of tickets for other passengers on the 22 November flight from Atlanta to Allentown. A video posted on Twitter shows a man standing in the aisle, yelling and insulting supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. The man asks loudly: \u201cWe got some Hillary bitches on here?\u201d He proceeds to clap and yell Trump\u2019s name a few times while other passengers seemingly try to ignore him, some staring at phones and tablets, others with arms folded. Referring to Trump\u2019s victory, he says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\u201d The writer Yashar Ali posted the video to Twitter, writing that a woman named Emma Baum filmed the encounter. Baum had also shared the video on her Facebook page, according to a Pennsylvania newspaper. Baum told the Morning Call newspaper that she first noticed the man while waiting to board the flight because he had chanted Trump\u2019s slogan several times. She was originally seated next to him, but switched with another passenger. Baum, 21, who lives in Belize and was on her way home to visit family, asked the man about the election and he then stood up to talk to her, according to the paper. The man was taken off the plane by a flight attendant, Baum said, but was let back on. Baum said she reported the man\u2019s behavior to airport security after the flight landed. The New York Times reported that it was unclear what measures were taken after the flight landed in Allentown. In responses to both videos, many were in disbelief that the man was not removed from the flight and speculated on how different his treatment would be if he were not white or not speaking English. Ali continued to tweet updates as he sought a \u201cdecent\u201d response from Delta. Delta, an Atlanta-based airline, had previously apologized over the man\u2019s outburst in a statement released on Saturday. Bastian said the crew questioned the man and made the best decision they could, given the information they had, and allowed him to remain on the flight. \u201cHowever, if our colleagues had witnessed first-hand what was shown in the video, there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft,\u201d he wrote Monday. \u201cHe will never again be allowed on a Delta plane.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
