Yards like Kingwood House, for instance, where Marcus Tregoning is putting a final competitive edge on two horses with very obvious chances in Group One events on the Knavesmire. Nayef, runner-up to Golan in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot, will be first to the barricades in the International Stakes on Tuesday when Sir Michael Stoute's colt is again likely to provide the sternest resistance. Rock Of Gibraltar, the Sussex Stakes winner, would surely have started favourite had he made it to post, but the O'Brien virus means that he will be in County Tipperary in six days' time. \"That's not too much of a shame from our point of view,\" Tregoning said yesterday, \"because we'll all get our turn, and for a really nice horse like Nayef obviously I need to win another Group One with him now. There's very few that can do it in two different seasons, and though he won in Dubai [in the Grade One Sheema Classic in March] we really want another one here.\" The King George looked to be a hard contest for both Golan and Nayef, but Tregoning is confident that a race that has bottomed out plenty of horses in the past has not left a mark on his. \"It was quite a hard race but he took it particularly well,\" he said. \"He's certainly been working as if he's fresh and well. He worked on grass this morning and I was extremely happy with him. I think the track at York and the 10-furlong trip will suit him really well, and I suppose it will probably come down to the two of them again.\" Nayef has often run with a pacemaker in the past, but will not have a stablemate to lead him on Tuesday. \"We didn't put one in at the early entry stage,\" Tregoning said, \"but it might not matter, and he's the sort of horse who could make his own running if he had to.\" Tregoning's other main hope next week is Dominica, who won the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot on her seasonal debut, and steps up to Group One company in the Nunthorpe Stakes. \"She's in really good form and we're hoping for a big run from her,\" Tregoning said. \"She could have run at Goodwood, but she's not very big and it seemed the right thing to go there fresh.\" Noverre, another likely runner in the International Stakes, was among three Godolphin entries yesterday for the Group One Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville on Sunday. York remains his favoured target, though, and in his absence Godolphin can field Best Of The Bests, Summoner, or both. John Dunlop has entered Tashawak and Fallen Star, while Banks Hill, a winner at the Breeders' Cup last season, looks best of the home side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
