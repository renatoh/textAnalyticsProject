Like its predecessor, What Are You Going Through is told from the perspective of a writer in late middle age, and the primary narrative revolves around the suicide of an old friend: in this case, a woman who, after a terminal cancer diagnosis, asks for assistance to end her life. It opens in 2017 with the narrator attending a lecture that details the insurmountable problems of the climate crisis, as well as \u201cthe inevitable next great flu pandemic\u201d. The talk, which asserts that reproduction itself is selfish in the face of climate collapse, ends with the suggestion that all humans can do is come to terms with devastation, \u201clove and forgive one another as best we could. And learn how to say goodbye.\u201d The novel is an attempt at this: both personally and culturally, it concerns itself with the end of things. What Are You Going Through is at its best in this investigation of finality, asking questions about the will to survive, its value and its cost. After initially refusing treatment because of the side effects, the unnamed friend experiences a feeling of anticlimax when she briefly believes that it has worked. The complex intimacy between the women, as they spend time together in a holiday house and prepare for the end, is powerfully affecting. Yet despite the fact that What Are You Going Through is structured as a novel-in-chorus, incorporating many people\u2019s stories into the narrative through their conversations with the narrator, the two central characters are the only ones drawn with complexity. The book\u2019s epigraph is the Simone Weil quote from which it takes its title, \u201cThe love of our neighbour in all its fullness simply means being able to say, \u2018What are you going through?\u2019\u201d, but this is applied to other characters in the book with a superficiality that does not extend to compassion. Other people are unintelligent, irritating, selfish, unlikable: the narrator is always sure of her superiority and she never changes her mind. In this way, the novel feels unintentionally representative of the imaginative failure of contemporary liberalism: its inability to even envisage, let alone work towards, different social structures. Clearly distressed at the state of American society, and endeavouring through her conversations with others to understand how we\u2019ve ended up here, the narrator nevertheless cannot extend her practice of listening beyond critique, towards a mutual interpersonal respect that might open up new possibilities for a better, more communal future. Women are represented with peculiar vitriol. Of a woman at the gym, the narrator declares: \u201cIn middle age she is toned but overweight, her precise features have blurred, the dazzle is gone.\u201d After describing a female academic as \u201ca familiar type: the glam academic, the intellectual vamp\u201d, she imagines her being humiliated by a male professor paying attention instead to a grad student who, \u201cafter just one glass of wine, is responding to his frequent glances with increasingly bold ones of her own\u201d. The idea that young women are at fault for men\u2019s sexual indiscretions is repeated throughout, notably in the suggestion that her friend\u2019s daughter (always an \u201cextraordinarily unlikable little girl\u201d) was responsible when her mother\u2019s boyfriend seduced her. In this context, the structural motif that recurs throughout the book, in which the narrator reads and paraphrases the plot of a misogynist crime novel, falls curiously flat. The novel tries to position itself as an empathetic depository of women\u2019s pain \u2013 \u201cWomen\u2019s stories are often sad stories,\u201d one chapter begins \u2013 but limits itself to observations about the perceived aesthetic decline of women\u2019s bodies as they age. After quoting an Ingeborg Bachmann story at length, the narrator writes: \u201cSince these words were written [\u2026] men and women have become even more divided.\u201d And then, immediately afterwards: \u201cRed states and blue states.\u201d This analogy, in a book highly concerned with the aftermath of the 2016 election, makes little sense; after all, the majority of white women in America voted for Trump. \u201cAccording to Bachmann,\u201d the narrator continues, \u201cfascism is the primary element in the relation between a man and a woman. Overstated.\u201d By erasing the context of Bachmann\u2019s writing \u2013 born in Austria in 1926, she was deeply engaged with fascism and its legacies at both a philosophical and personal level \u2013 this becomes another glib point in a series, demonstrating only that the narrator has read a lot. Towards the end of the novel, the doomsday climate professor becomes a more three-dimensional character. His \u201cmonomaniacal\u201d obsession stems in part, he admits, from a desire for his grandchildren to forgive him. In the final pages, the narrator sits on a park bench, \u201cblessing\u201d those that pass, asking for forgiveness herself. What Are You Going Through reaches, in its second part, towards mercy; it just fails to believe that everyone deserves it. \u2022 What Are You Going Through is published by Virago (\u00a316.99).
