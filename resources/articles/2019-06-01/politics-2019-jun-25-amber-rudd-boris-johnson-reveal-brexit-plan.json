Speaking after Johnson broke his recent silence to be questioned about Brexit and his personal life in a BBC interview, Rudd added to warnings that his government could be swiftly brought down if it pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, who supports Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest, said while she would not vote to support a no-confidence motion against a Johnson government to stop no deal, speculation that up to a dozen Tory MPs might do so seemed \u201cabout right\u201d. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, in his first televised interview since his campaign kicked off more than four weeks ago, Johnson said he would never reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds last week. \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones. And there\u2019s a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really is, is, in a way that is not fair on them,\u201d he said. He defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union, but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement, which some Conservative Eurosceptics have said they believed he was planning to do. Johnson claimed issues including the Irish border would be tackled \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d but then was forced to agree that the UK would not be entitled to such an implementation period without signing up to the current withdrawal agreement. Asked about the interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rudd said she had not been entirely convinced. \u201cThere are two problems we have as a government for delivering on this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the impasse with the European Union, and there\u2019s the impasse in parliament with MPs. I appreciate Boris\u2019s enthusiasm and his confidence and positivity, but I still think we\u2019re looking for the evidence of what the plan is.\u201d In the interview, Johnson said he would seek to deploy some \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d over the UK\u2019s \u00a339bn separation payment as a lever to push the EU into new concessions. Rudd said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough, no. I think Boris needs to go further in explaining how he would do it. What happens on 31 October if, despite his great powers of persuasion, he has not managed to break this deadlock. We need to understand what the facts are underneath this.\u201d Asked if she would join Conservative MPs such as Ken Clarke in backing a no-confidence motion to block a no-deal departure, Rudd said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t. But he is right that there are a number of Conservatives who take that view. \u201cThis reinforces the point I\u2019m making, which is this is an incredibly difficult situation, and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative party that have concerns, and try to break the impasse with the European Union. Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient.\u201d The junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood has predicted that up to a dozen MPs could rebel. Rudd said: \u201cI think that\u2019s about right. I think it\u2019s slightly less than that, but it\u2019s certainly more than two.\u201d Rudd described Johnson\u2019s wariness of taking part in TV debates against Hunt as \u201cvery odd\u201d. After Johnson said he would not take part in a planned Sky News debate with Hunt on Tuesday night, the broadcaster cancelled the programme. It is understood Johnson declined to take part in Sky\u2019s debate because of terms agreed for an ITV debate next week, which the broadcaster has asked be the first head-to-head debate. However, Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that Johnson had declined all television debates until Conservative members had begun returning their ballot papers. \u201cBottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform,\u201d a source close to Hunt\u2019s campaign said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
