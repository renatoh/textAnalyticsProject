Still, he's better off than Michael Caine, who doesn't even make it past the opening credits. Caine's character's death, and his wish for his ashes to be scattered off the Margate coast, set in motion this unassuming drama, adapted from Graham Swift's Booker-winning novel. Caine's former boozing pals (Hemmings, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay) and his embittered son (Ray Winstone) are charged with the duty, and their car journey from London frames a series of reminiscences, sometimes clumsily strung together. Despite their collective decrepitude, the old boys still know how to act, and director Fred Schepisi guides them (and Helen Mirren, as Caine's wife) seamlessly through the full range of emotions, grounding the characters in a convincing postwar Britain. As an exploration of little-explored emotional lives, the film is a success, but if it wasn't for the performances, and the superlative cinematography, it could have felt like a feature-length episode of Last of the Summer Wine. Storytelling Rental and DVD \u00a319.99 Entertainment Cert 18 *** Director Todd Solondz obviously had a hard time following up the wonderfully sour Happiness, and it looks like he just thought too hard about it. Though there's nothing bad about this self-reflexive comedy, it never reaches the heights that Happiness managed, partly because it's two different films stuck together: a short, sharp \"fiction\" opener and a longer, looser \"non-fiction\" segment. The first is a hilarious satire of political values on a university campus, stacked with the kind of dry and inappropriate humour that nobody but Solondz seems capable of. Part two follows an inept film-maker (Paul Giamatti) tracking an unmotivated American youth for his documentary - again, rich territory for satire, but Solondz slips back into the old \"dysfunctional suburban family\" scenario. Though John Goodman is entertaining as the domineering patriarch, it feels like a soft target after what's gone before. Nothing quite hangs together but it's only a disappointment by Solondz's own standards. Perhaps he'll do better next time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
