Cramping up and burdened with having to save three match points midway through a three-hour fight against the rampant Ksenia Pervak, the British No1 closed it out in style, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, and now meets her Wimbledon conqueror, Agnieszka Radwanska. \"It was tough,\" Watson said. \"I didn't start great. I didn't think I was coping well with the wind and couldn't find my serve. I do make it hard for myself. It would be nicer to win 6-2, 6-2.\" Watson, who also cramped up in her first-round match and has been guarding a recovering elbow injury, said she was exhausted in the second set, especially when 6-3 down to the Kazakh in the tie-break, but found renewed vigour from the crowd. \"The were absolutely unbelievable from start to finish. It's easy to support someone when they're winning, but when they're losing it's not as easy.\" When she saw how disappointed Pervak was in failing to finish her off in the second set, Watson launched a quick-kill assault on nearly every point in the third because she was again bedevilled by cramping. When it was done, she rushed to the gathering of British fans and said: \"Thank you so much, you were awesome.\" As for Radwanska, Watson admits she let herself down when nerves got the better of her at Wimbledon last year. She is determined to get revenge. \"She's a very different player to most of the girls,\" Watson said. \"She's consistent, got great feel, so it's going to be another physical match. The first time I played her I just went in guns blazing, didn't know what to do, went for way too much. This time I'm coming in a different player, and I'm going to approach it differently. \"I feel more experienced, more confident in my game. This is my second third round now, so I've been here. I'm just looking forward to it.\" Her coach Mauricio Hadad said: \"When she starts swinging and hitting, her level rises dramatically \u2013 and that's why she's winning these third sets with ease.\" He sees her growing in her understanding of the game, too. \"She's relatively new to the tour, only a year on the full tour and she has to work on hitting the ball; that's what she started on from day one. She has got better but she can do a lot better and can hit the ball from the very first moment. \"As she grows older and gets more mature and more confidence in herself and [realises] the way she needs to play to beat the top girls, she will continue to do it. She is starting to understand how and when to hit the ball hard and how to keep the ball in play, using her biggest asset \u2013 which is her footwork. The way she runs, it's very difficult to get the ball past her. She needs to continue to work the same way.\" Hadad said her courage and will are key factors. \"She will not give up. You will have to beat her, because she ain't going to give it away. At 6-3 [in the tie-break], that's what happened: two very long rallies and she didn't miss. The momentum changed, Pervak played a shaky point at 6-5 and when they re-started, within two minutes it was 3-0. Heather kept going and going from there. When she hits the ball that hard, it is very difficult to play against.\" That resolve will be tested to the limit against the No4 seed. Laura Robson will face a similar challenge when she faces the No8 seed, Petra Kvitova, in the second round on Thursday morning. Robson, whose career began in a blaze as a Wimbledon starlet four years ago, is becoming accustomed to the big stage. After seeing off Kim Clijsters in the Arthur Ashe cauldron at Flushing Meadows in the Belgian's farewell appearance four months ago, she has been assigned the Rod Laver Arena to face the former Wimbledon champion. Following Roger Federer in the second night match does not bother her, either. \"That's pretty cool,\" she said, after seeing the schedule. It will be cool, literally, as well, given the near-century temperatures forecast during the day. \"Sure I'm excited. It's definitely going to be a tough match, but I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully people will stick around and not leave after Federer [who plays Nikolay Davydenko]. \"I love big occasions. I think it is easy to play on a big court with a big crowd when you have nothing to lose. It is enjoyable.\"She could hardly feel more at home than in the city where she was born, leaving for the UK with her parents when she was six. \"I have family who have flown in from Perth,\" she said, \"but I treat it like every other tournament. My sister lives here but, no, I don't get recognised in the street. I prefer to keep a low profile so hopefully that won't change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
