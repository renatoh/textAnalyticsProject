How does one do this? I have Windows XP with SP2 installed. Michael Moore Jack Schofield replies: The column was about a new type of phishing attack, which Sophos calls JS/QHosts21-A, using a virus-like technique, and MessageLabs's PR says it \"clearly presented this particular one as very low risk\". It might become significant in the future, but today, you would need to be using an unpatched version of Windows and have a bank account in Brazil, so your chances of getting it are indistinguishable from zero. You are at much greater risk of being stung by some very common phishing attacks, and you can test your gullibility by taking MailFrontier's Phishing IQ quiz at http://survey.mailfrontier. com/survey/quiztest.html. You should get 10 out of 10 if you remember that nobody whose job it is to look after your account details will ever ask for them. The interesting point about the JavaScript QHosts21-A exploit is that, like some viruses and hijackers, it uses the obsolete internet Hosts file. Hosts can map a human-friendly host name (Google.com) to an IP address (66.249.64.45), though normally this would be done by your ISP's domain name server (DNS). The phishing virus aimed to put a different IP address in Hosts so that your computer would use the correct host name to take you to the wrong site. Search your hard drive for hosts files and check that there's only one entry - 127.0.0.1 localhost - for your local PC. (Linux PCs and Macs have Hosts files, too.) In general, I like the idea of turning off Windows Scripting Host (WSH), and explained how to do when the LoveBug virus was rampant. Unfortunately, huge numbers of websites use Netscape's JavaScript or Microsoft's VBScript and work badly or not at all if you disable them. If you want to try it, see Sophos's instructions at www.sophos.com/support/wsh.html.. In the meantime, make sure your Internet Explorer security settings are up to scratch. Go to Tools|Internet Options, click the Security tab, then the button marked Custom Level. This lets you disable ActiveX controls and scripts, or ask to be prompted before they are run. Any actions by unsigned controls and scripts not marked as safe should be disabled. Setting some others to Prompt will teach you how common these things are. Pirate XP I bought a \"nearly new\" notebook PC on eBay, but the Windows Update site will not install SP2: it says the copy of Windows XP Pro is invalid. Name withheld JS: Microsoft has said it wants to get SP2 on as many machines as possible, because of its much improved security, and it is generally updating PCs even if they have pirate copies of Windows XP. Yours is probably an old version that was also blocked from installing the first service pack, SP1. You can check the Product ID and Product Key used by downloading Everest Home Edition from www.lavalys.com. This excellent inventory program will tell you almost everything you need to know about your PC. Then do a web search on the first five letters of the Product Key. If they are FCKGW, you lose. Microsoft UK's Paul Randle says you can check whether a Microsoft product is a pirate copy by going to www.howtotell.com, and he suggests the easiest option is to buy a new copy of XP. A clean installation would be advisable, but if you install it as an upgrade, it should preserve your programs and data. Missing dll I have recently acquired an error message that says \"error starting program missing csh.dll\". It gives no clue as to what program it is. The computer works fine but it is very annoying. Stephen Wesson JS: This file is part of AOL Instant Messenger and you should find it in the C:\\Program files\\AIM directory, or something similar. If you have AIM, you can either tell it not to start up in the background (which unnecessarily consumes resources) or reinstall AIM and check that the csh.dll file is present. It may help to run Startup Inspector for Windows (www.windowsstartup.com) or, if you are feeling geeky, Process Explorer from Sysinternals (http://masl.to/?Y2EC12099). Both are free. Backchat \u00b7 Last week, Robert Gardiner asked about taking back-ups on external drives. Raymond Mercier adds: \"If you have a spare 5.25in bay you can install a removable drawer in it, and that can be used to hold the backup hard disk, connected as a slave. You get the advantage of a removable back-up, but one which is tidier and probably faster than an external drive plugged into USB or Firewire.\" \u00b7 Ed Dagnall reports that Norton Anti-Virus, which had been hiding from the Security Centre in Windows XP SP2, is now registering its presence. If so, you will no longer be warned that you are not running an AV program when you are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
