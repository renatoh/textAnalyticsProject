Edward II was one of the earliest English history plays and has been reinterpreted by those as varied as Bertold Brecht and film director Derek Jarman. Now it has been adapted by UK playwright Anthony Weigh. This interpretation smashes together the personal and political, putting a provocative lens on the king who must pay for mixing private with public. Luton presents the story of a newly crowned leader who, convinced he\u2019s invincible, flaunts his affair with another man, causing outrage across the nation.
