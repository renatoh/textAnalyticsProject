Alistair Darling delivered his lines with a sure-footed comic timing when he said \"we are ready to sign tax information-exchange agreements with three additional countries \u2013 Dominica, Grenada and [pause] Belize\". He waited for the waving order papers to subside before he added that the agreements would be signed in the next few days. It meant he would get more information from the central American state \u2013 and, by implication, Ashcroft \u2013 than the Tory leadership had managed in a decade. To emphasise his point, the chancellor warned that a general clampdown on tax would yield more than \u00a31.5bn. Another tax treaty with tiny Liechtenstein is scheduled to haul in more than \u00a3500m. Yet, according to tax experts across the political spectrum, the agreement with Belize will elicit little information about Ashcroft \u2013 let alone tax. His assets are safe from the British taxman unless he wants to declare them himself, which is not expected. Like most Belize residents, he is unlikely to keep any cash in bank accounts in his own name. Mostly, accounts are in the name of a company, which is in turn owned by a trust. Under the agreement with Belize, the British revenue would need to know the names behind the trust to ask for information. Without a register of interests, there is little way a tax inspector could find out who the ultimate owner is. Information exchange agreements are not retrospective so, by the time it comes into force, Ashcroft will be on the brink of becoming a UK taxpayer. Following the furore around his refusal to say where he paid tax, he renounced his non-domiciled status and said that, after the election, he would become a full UK taxpayer. The government has signed around 60 such deals, many of them with tax havens, with a view to stemming the flow of untaxed cash overseas. The Liechtenstein deal is tougher. Set up in August 2009, it runs until March 2015. It allows people with unpaid taxes due on investments or assets to settle their tax liability, including interest and penalties. It is estimated that, over the lifetime of the agreement, this will bring in \u00a3940m. Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton, tax accountants, said agreements like the one with Belize were fraught with difficulties. \"Clamping down on offshore tax avoidance is like catching a bar of soap,\" he said. \"I'm always sceptical when chancellors say it will bring in millions of pounds because fertile minds always find their way around the rules.\" Some experts believe the spotlight will soon fall on the fast growing financial centres of Singapore and Kuwait, which act as tax havens for increasing numbers of wealthy westerners. Yves Remedios, tax adviser at accountants BDO, said Belize was small fry. \"HMRC's success with its information exchange agreements in Europe has caused money to move away to the Middle East and far east. So the next moves will be further afield with agreements in financial centres such as Singapore that have continued to flourish.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
