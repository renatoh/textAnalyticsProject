His team strengthened their grip on third place with this victory over fourth-placed Bath but, having looked set for a bonus point with three tries in 20 first-half minutes, they failed to put the West Country side away and gifted them a faint whiff of an unlikely win. \"I'm pleased we won but disappointed because after the way we played in the first half we deserved a bonus point,\" said Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"We played all the rugby but didn't kill the game. We had two opportunities to score and we missed an easy kick. After Bath scored their try it was a tight game.\" In the second quarter, however, Sale showed just why they merit that third place, with Chris Mayor cutting through Frikkie Welsh to score their first try. The former rugby league player, on as a blood replacement for Steve Hanley, touched down and departed almost in the same breath as Hanley returned. The Bath fly-half Chris Malone replied with a penalty shortly before rapid lineout ball from S\u00e9bastian Chabal enabled Jos Baxendell to supply a perfectly timed short inside pass for Mark Cueto to take the ball at speed through a hole in the Bath cover. Then the forwards took over, winning a series of scrums on the Bath line which led to two warnings for the visiting prop Duncan Bell and a possible case for a penalty try before the flanker John Carter - playing in National Two with Doncaster last season but the pick of the loose forwards here - bundled through a large ruck in the 39th minute. After the break Sale let two opportunities for the bonus point slip away in two minutes. Cueto was beaten to Baxendell's grub-kick by Brendon Daniel, then Hodgson fired a wild pass over the head of Mayor, who had come on again for Hanley when the wing suffered a facial injury. Bath had suffered a blow before kick-off with the withdrawal of Ollie Barkley, who tweaked his back during kicking practice on Boxing Day, and his boot was sorely missed. The stand-in Malone missed three penalties and a drop-goal in the swirling wind, although the 19-year-old Ryan Davis marked his Premiership debut with a fine try on the hour, picking up the loose ball after Joe Maddock had taken Malone's cross-field kick. Bath had the better of a final quarter, which all left Saint-Andr\u00e9 unseasonally grumpy. \"We tried to play a positive game, a quick game, and all the time they were slowing it down. It's very frustrating. If the other team don't want to play like that, if there are two or three guys slowing it down, if there are injuries all the time and things, the referee has to give yellow cards.\" Sale: Robinson; Cueto, Baxendell, Todd, Hanley (Mayor, h-t); Hodgson, Wigglesworth; Sheridan, Bruno (Titterell, 68), Stewart (Turner, 61), Day (Jones, 50), Schofield, White, Carter, Chabal.
