Their remarks, criticising the Premier League official Sian Massey and the West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady, sparked a widespread backlash against the pair and led Sky Sports to suspend them from duty for tonight's match between Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. It was unclear when they will return to the screen. The broadcaster said that it had made clear to both that their comments were \"totally unacceptable\" and \"inexcusable from anyone at Sky regardless of their role or seniority\". The criticisms continued today. The England captain Rio Ferdinand labelled their views \"prehistoric\" and said women should be judged on their ability to officiate alone, while Brady said the remarks had made her \"blood boil\". Keys and Gray have been the faces of Sky's Premier League coverage since its inception. The broadcaster was today forced to replace Keys with the Sky Sports News presenter Dave Jones. In a leaked recording made during Liverpool's match with Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, the pair, who thought their microphones were switched off, suggested that female officials \"don't know the offside rule\". Keys then added: \"I can guarantee you there'll be a big one today. [Liverpool manager] Kenny [Dalglish] will go potty.\" Massey made a narrow offside call, proved by replays to be correct. Keys went on to remark on Brady's newspaper column, saying: \"The game's gone mad. See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. Do me a favour, love.\" The Premier League confirmed tonight that Keys phoned Massey last night to apologise. Today a second clip emerged that showed Gray exchanging sexist comments with a Sky Sports touchline reporter before the match, referring to Massey's looks. The Sky Sports managing director, Barney Francis, said he had spoken to Keys and Gray personally. \"Those views are entirely inconsistent with our ethos as a business and employer, and will rightly offend many of our customers, our people and the wider public,\" he said. Tory MP Dominic Raab put himself at the centre of another sexism row today, labelling feminists \"obnoxious bigots\" and claiming men got a \"raw deal\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
