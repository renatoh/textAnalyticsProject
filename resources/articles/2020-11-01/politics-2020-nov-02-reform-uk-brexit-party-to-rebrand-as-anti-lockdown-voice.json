The party\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, and chairman, Richard Tice, first announced the plan in a joint article in the Telegraph where they wrote it was \u201ctime to redirect our energies\u201d. The name change is subject to approval of the commission. The Brexit party gained 2% of the vote in the 2019 general election, and none of the 275 candidates it stood won a seat. Prior to the December election, Farage had announced the party would change its name following the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union and focus on campaigning for changes in the electoral system. In a statement on Sunday announcing the plans to rebrand the party, Farage said: \u201cAs promised, we continue to keep a very close eye on the government\u2019s trade negotiations with the EU, to ensure a proper Brexit. Further reform in many other areas is also vital for our nations\u2019 future.\u201d Tice added: \u201cThe need for major reform in the UK is clearer now than ever. A new approach is essential, so that government works for the people, not for itself.\u201d He said that a new strategy was needed for tackling the coronavirus so that \u201cwe learn to live with it, not hide in fear of it\u201d. The idea of ending the Covid pandemic through herd immunity was recently denounced as \u201ca dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence\u201d, by 80 researchers who wrote a warning letter in a leading medical journal. The Brexit party announcement comes as England prepares to enter a four-week nationwide lockdown on 5 November, a decision which has angered some Tory MPs, with prominent backbenchers including Sir Graham Brady warning they are likely to vote against the new restrictions. MPs will vote on the second lockdown on Wednesday as experts warn that the daily death toll could reach as high as 4,000 by Christmas if swift action is not taken. Announcing the decision on Saturday evening, Boris Johnson said that if nothing is done the country faced a \u201cpeak of mortality\u201d worse than that of the first wave in April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
