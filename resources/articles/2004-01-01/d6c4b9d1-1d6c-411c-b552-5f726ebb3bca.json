Senior executives at a rival company, which is bidding for indebted plants, yesterday accused the owner-creditor banks in turn of planning to drive up and control wholesale electricity prices. The executives, who asked not to be named, warned that the new company, chaired by Jim Forbes, the former Scottish &amp; Southern Energy chief executive, would face extensive litigation and regulatory intervention if it and the banks proceeded with their plans. But CGE, which wants to buy the bulk of two dozen indebted plants, insisted that the project finance and investment arms of the banks operated at strict arm's length. CGE was set up late last year with support from six banks - Abbey, Bayerische Landesbank, HBOS, HypoVereinsBank, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland. They are among 127 creditors exposed to \"several billions\" of debt incurred by power plant operators. Eddie Hyams, the new chief executive, told the Guardian last week that CGE expected to begin trading electricity in June-July and is set on acquiring as much as 14,000MW of capacity - putting it on a par with Innogy and Powergen. The issue of its owner banks' alleged power to fix market prices has arisen because CGE is among at least three bidders for Damhead Creek, a 800MW gas-fired plant in Kent, along with Scottish Power and independent US producer Calpine. Scottish Power, which confirmed its interest yesterday, is said by industry newsletter Power Finance &amp; Risk to have offered \u00a3309m in cash against a \u00a3350m debt-financed bid from CGE - and a \u00a3260m cash and debt bid from Calpine. The Scots, who are making their second bid to acquire the plant, want to expand their portfolio in southern England to meet growing retail demand. But, refusing to take part in any bidding war, they are said to be on the brink of walking away. One rival bidder - not California-based Calpine - said the banks behind CGE were in effect buying back their own debt paper and, by seizing operational control of plants, setting and controlling prices in the British power market. Executives accused CGE of blocking any cash bids for bank-controlled assets. \"In essence they are saying to other creditors that if you don't go with the CGE offer to swap debt paper in a new off-balance-sheet vehicle, we will block the sale to legitimate third party bidders,\" one said. CGE admits that it wants to see market prices rise, but Mr Hyams said the main aim was to enable the banks to get their money back. His aides pointed out that any offer was extended to all creditor banks. Industry sources added that rising prices had prompted creditors at Drax, Europe's biggest coal-fired station, to hold on to their debt late last year rather than accept a \"too low\" cash offer from Independent Power. \"That's a choice for all creditor banks to make,\" they said. Ofge, the industry regulator which has held extensive talks with CGE on its plans, said the Office of Fair Trading could intervene if CGE abused its market position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
