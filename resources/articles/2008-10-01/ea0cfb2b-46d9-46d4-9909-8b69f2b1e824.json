Will this Twenty20 game between the Stanford Superstars and England do cricket any good or is it just a way of bolstering the egos of a few administrators? What is crucial is that the players don't take the blame. After all, anyone would jump at the chance to make \u00a3500,000 in three hours, so good luck to them. But any criticism should be aimed at the men in suits, not the blokes in tracksuits. Put simply, the whole concept doesn't sit comfortably with me. You have to wonder whether the administrators are happy with the amount of problems a game like this could cause. Do they realise they are in danger of creating an imbalance between the three forms of international cricket by placing so much financial emphasis on what is essentially a one-off match? And are they confident they can deal with the potential fallout in the dressing room? Because make no mistake: with this match taking place every year until 2012 at least, the money will be a huge talking point. For example, the Test team will contain some players who appear in Antigua and others who don't. How will a guy who's left out feel when the others start talking about the money they could make next November? The spirit of equality is one of the vital ingredients to a happy dressing room and this doesn't exactly feel equal to me. That crucial bond between players could come under threat. There are other implications too. Even the four blokes who don't make the final XI stand to earn more for sitting around for three hours doing nothing than guys who are battling it out in the heat of a five-day Test. That's a dangerous line to tread and it's going to need some very skilled management. I believe the powers that be have organised this game to appease the players over the Indian Premier League: it's one hell of a way to backtrack. And what about further down the line? No one can be sure that youngsters coming into the game won't just end up playing Twenty20 cricket because of the financial rewards. We'll need strong administration at junior level to keep the longer form of the game going. As for other ramifications, we will only know about them as time goes on. As a coach I know full well that you can prepare for one set of problems, only for a different set to crop up out of the blue. As far as selection goes, the only real issue I can foresee is if Kevin Pietersen, the England captain, has to tell a regular he's not made it. That scenario could occur if the pitch is taking turn and they have to include both spinners at the expense of one of the regular seamers. And even if it isn't, they still have to choose between Samit Patel and Graeme Swann. It's precisely the kind of dilemma this game throws up: Swann has been around for a while, but now Patel has come to the fore and is probably the better all-round bet. At least one of the seamers will have to sit it out. Do you go for your more reliable types - Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad - or do you take a risk on the more explosive bowlers, like Steve Harmison and Jimmy Anderson? Both have been erratic but, if the ball doesn't swing, Sidebottom could struggle. I think Luke Wright offers the option of taking the pace off the ball - you want to cover all your bases out there, as pitches can be on the slow side. He seems to add a buzz but he needs to learn that batting at international level is not just about hitting across the line. As a coach you'd try to treat the match like a normal game. \"Try\" is the crucial word here, because I'm not sure if you really can treat it that way. The money adds a huge burden to all the normal pressures you get playing for England and, although you'd try to institute a method to deal with those pressures, the chances are you'll be flying by the seat of your pants. The same goes for the players. They're going to have to make spur-of-the-moment decisions on the field knowing they could lose \u00a3500,000 if they get it wrong. I believe the money could stifle a player's flair and his ability to take risks. One last thought. The umpires will be able to refer any decision they like, which essentially means they become the guys who hold the bowler's hat. It will be very hard to judge whether or not they are actually good umpires. I've always advocated the three-referrals system currently being trialled in Test cricket because it means the umpires can't hide behind technology. And if this system is being introduced because of the money at stake, does that mean Test matches and one-day internationals aren't as important? As with so many aspects of this game, there are a few too many questions for comfort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
