(BBC One) | iPlayer Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator (Netflix) My Grandparents\u2019 War (Channel 4) | All4 Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One) | iPlayer Silicon Valley (Sky Atlantic) If Meat: A Threat To Our Planet? didn\u2019t put you off your hotdog, nothing will. Presented by wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin, who presented last year\u2019s Drowning in Plastic, it was a damning exploration of the global meat industry, mainly focused on the US, where the right to consume vast quantities of meat with squirty bottles of barbecue sauce appears to have been written into the American Constitution. The ugly truths were relentless. The world consumes 65bn animals annually. Cattle rearing has reduced the Amazon forest by 20% (and counting). Wildlife species are perishing\u2026 and so on. Bonnin clearly wished to maintain her scientific distance, but even she became tearful when she observed the hacked-up Amazon from a plane; elsewhere, you could almost smell the steaming lakes of Barbie-pink toxic pig waste. For this soppy vegetarian, the industrial \u201cfeed-farms\u201d and barns of pigs and chickens were unbearable \u2013 a veritable Glastonbury of animal death. One documentary couldn\u2019t cover everything; as always with these reports, more questions were raised than answered. However, Bonnin, who has now given up red meat, more than did her bit in smashing the emergency glass of public consciousness. Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator was a documentary about Bikram Choudhury, 75, the self-styled \u201cbad boy of yoga\u201d, infamous for conducting his vast, overheated classes clad in only a pair of Speedos and a Rolex. What could possibly go wrong? Eva Orner\u2019s documentary probed forensically into the still-esteemed yoga guru, but the main focus was on the rape/sexual allegations from former students on his $10K teacher-training courses, featuring interviews with some of the women. Choudhury was also sued by a student for racial discrimination (\u201cGet that black bitch out of here, she\u2019s a cancer\u201d). When Choudhury lost a $6.8m civil case (wrongful termination/sexual harassment) brought by a former legal adviser, he fled the US without paying up. While he clearly views himself as a lovable showman, a yogi-Barnum, Choudhury comes across as a clueless, narcissistic motormouth \u2013 even in a legal deposition he lists his dislikes as \u201ccold weather, cold food, cold heart, cold pussy\u201d. Watching all this, it was striking to note the bizarre masochism of the affluent west, with Choudhury\u2019s students just accepting his startling rudeness (\u201cSuck that fucking fat stomach in, I don\u2019t like to see the jiggle-jiggle\u201d). The culture of systemic sexist abuse predated #MeToo, with god knows how many young women (usually dependent on Choudhury for permission to open Bikram studios) summoned for late-night \u201cmassages\u201d. The truly shocking thing is that Choudhury, who denies all allegations and hasn\u2019t been charged, continues teaching outside the US. Scanning the participants for My Grandparents\u2019 War (Helena Bonham Carter, Kristin Scott Thomas, Mark Rylance, Carey Mulligan), I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: don\u2019t working-class people or ethnic minorities have wars? Or grandparents? That said, this opener from Bonham Carter was both fascinating and poignant. In Britain during the second world war, her paternal grandmother, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, helped refugees and spoke out against antisemitism to such an extent that she was placed on a Gestapo blacklist. In France, Bonham Carter\u2019s maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callej\u00f3n, a half-Jewish Spanish diplomat, authorised as many visas as he could to help Jewish people escape the Nazis, signing with both hands to save time. Eduardo was posthumously honoured by the Jewish community, while Violet spent some of the war as an air warden: \u201cBrave\u2026 but also completely bonkers, going out, bombs flying,\u201d mused Bonham Carter. Nevertheless, she was visibly moved to meet descendants of the people her grandparents helped, one of whom went on to be the founder of Unicef. To say that Elton John (real name Reg Dwight) has lived an eventful life is to understate it \u2013 this is a man who needs his own wing of Wikipedia. On Elton John: Uncensored, John, resplendent in lilac glasses, had a relaxed chat with Graham Norton, ruminating on everything from music, drugs and toupees (\u201cI don\u2019t like being bald, I look like Shrek\u201d), to the Elton John Aids Foundation (he continues to be a tireless supporter of the international LGBTQ+ community), his \u201cfarewell letter\u201d to cocaine in rehab (usually lyricist Bernie Taupin does the words), his mother meeting Michael Jackson (\u201cYou need a bloody good meal, you do!\u201d), and the prostate cancer that once left him performing on stage in adult nappies. \u201cThere are very few bits of me left,\u201d observed John. \u201cThere\u2019s no hair. There\u2019s a pacemaker. There are no tonsils. There\u2019s no prostate. There\u2019s no appendix. I\u2019ve had kidney stones\u2026 I\u2019m like the bionic woman. I\u2019m like Lindsay Wagner, or Steve Austin, whichever one you want to call it, we\u2019re so gender fluid now.\u201d John, 72, could obviously include work as one of his lifetime of addictions. Right now, there\u2019s a 300-date farewell tour, the bestselling autobiography Me, the biopic, Rocketman, The Lion King stage show\u2026 yet John considers this to be slowing down! He says that, these days, it\u2019s all about his young sons with husband, David Furnish: \u201cOriginally, I was going to die on stage, now I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I want to be with my kids.\u201d Bravo, sir. This is the final series of Silicon Valley, creator Mike Judge\u2019s masterful comedy set at the terribly named Pied Piper startup in the tech valley of the dolts. I\u2019ve always been completely lost with the computer terms (\u201cdecentralised internets\u201d?) but, at core, Silicon Valley is a blackly absurdist ensemble piece, with a pitch-perfect cast, including twitchy Richard (Thomas Middleditch), needy Jared (Zach Woods) and ever-corruptible Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani). The women have been a tad underpowered, though Monica (Amanda Crew) has had more to do recently. However, Silicon Valley has been priceless for its jabs at the likes of Facebook and Google, while delivering billionaire monsters of almost Shakespearean intensity \u2013 last week, Richard\u2019s arch-enemy, Hooli\u2019s Gavin Belson (Matt Ross), styled himself as a man of \u201cTethics\u201d. Elsewhere, the incomparable dark lord of sardonic geek-dom, Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), walked into a meeting, drawling: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t told you what we want yet,\u201d said Monica. \u201cIrrelevant.\u201d This show will be missed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
