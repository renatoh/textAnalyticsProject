Sturridge had trained \"exceptionally well\", according to Rodgers, in response to being dropped to the bench and criticised by the Liverpool manager in the Merseyside derby with Everton last Saturday. Rodgers was unhappy with the 24-year-old playing 90 minutes for England against Germany with a thigh problem before the derby but those injury concerns multiplied after Sturridge left Melwood on crutches on Friday. The Liverpool striker was immediately taken for a scan on his left ankle and, though the full extent of damage has only now become clear, the club were braced for bad news. Sturridge had suffered ligament damage in his right ankle playing for England against the Republic of Ireland in May and it took a punishing personal fitness programme for him to recover inside three months. Losing Sturridge represents a serious setback for Rodgers in his attempts to maintain Liverpool's impressive form in 2013 and guide the club back into the Champions League. Last weekend's rebuke aside, the \u00a312m signing from Chelsea has flourished at Anfield and his 89th-minute equaliser at Everton was his 11th goal of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
