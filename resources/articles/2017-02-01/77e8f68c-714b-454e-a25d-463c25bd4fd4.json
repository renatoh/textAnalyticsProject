LaPierre called \u201cleftwing judicial activism\u201d a \u201cform of violence against our constitutional system\u201d. \u201cThey do violence to the constitution\u2019s separation of powers, they do violence to the US code and the supreme court precedent, and they do violence to the checks and balances that keep government under control,\u201d he said. Even for LaPierre, a flame-throwing political provocateur, the outright attack on America\u2019s judiciary was a new escalation in rhetoric. It was met with only tepid applause from the conservative audience. The Trump administration backed away from defending the president\u2019s hastily issued executive order after a panel of federal judges upheld a court order temporarily suspending the travel ban pending a full court challenge. Trump later said the White House would rewrite the ban, an effort that is still in progress. But LaPierre, the head of a gun rights group that devoted at least $30m to electing Trump, suggested that the judges had blatantly ignored the law in ruling against the president. LaPierre\u2019s remarks echoed Trump\u2019s widely criticized attacks against the judges in the travel ban cases \u2013 comments that Trump\u2019s own supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, called \u201cdisheartening and demoralizing\u201d. The NRA leader\u2019s attack on America\u2019s court system was the most radical moment in an extreme speech that painted gun-loving NRA members as the nation\u2019s best defense against violent, ruthless, out-of-control leftist protesters. The speech was filled with incendiary metaphors and accusations that liberal Trump protesters and Islamic State militants were both threats to America\u2019s freedom \u2013 and should both be considered terrorists. Liberal groups arrayed against Trump \u201call share one thing in common: they\u2019re angry, they\u2019re militant, and they\u2019re willing to engage in criminal violence to get what they want,\u201d LaPierre said. After the election, some experts on the gun group wondered who would replace Hillary Clinton as the NRA\u2019s enemy number one. LaPierre\u2019s CPAC speech gave the answer: Americans who protest against Trump are now the enemy. LaPierre spoke approvingly of hanging people for leaking information about the president: \u201cA hundred years ago, if you eavesdropped and published the affairs of the head of state you would have been tracked down and hanged for treason,\u201d he said to applause. He drew a direct line between Islamic State fighters and college protesters at Berkeley. He suggested, with no evidence, that terrorists might take advantage of the ongoing protests against Trump\u2019s agenda to harm Americans. \u201cWith social media, it\u2019s easy enough to find out where to go and when. So what happens when terrorists tag along with a flashmob protest at your local airport and gas the place like they did in Tokyo?\u201d he asked. LaPierre made no mention of Islamophobic and xenophobic violence across the country. In Kansas on Thursday, an Indian-born engineer was shot dead and two others injured by a man who allegedly shouted \u201cgo back to your country\u201d before shooting them. Shortly before the election, a group of rightwing militia group members were arrested and charged with plotting to blow up a mosque in a Somali immigrant community in Kansas. According to court documents, one of the alleged conspirators had promised that he wanted to destroy everyone, even a \u201cone-year-old\u201d child. While some protesters at Trump\u2019s inauguration were arrested, the largest protest so far against Trump, the day after his inauguration, was reportedly entirely peaceful, and was led by women wearing hand-knit pink hats. Apocalyptic rhetoric, attacks on the allegedly biased leftwing media and claims that Democratic politicians would like to confiscate Americans\u2019 guns are standard fare for LaPierre. He played a short clip from more than a decade ago where he attacked CNN for publishing what he called a \u201cfake\u201d story about the assault weapon ban, suggesting that he had been attacking CNN for fake news long before it was cool. \u201cOur country is under siege from a media carpet-bombing campaign,\u201d LaPierre said. The media attack was aimed at \u201cpurposely and maliciously destroying the Trump presidency\u201d. In response to liberals who have pledged to fight in the \u201cresistance\u201d against Trump, the NRA and its members will mount the \u201ccounter-resistance\u201d, the group promised in a series of videos advertising LaPierre\u2019s speech this week. Trump took a moment to give LaPierre and the NRA special praise in his own CPAC speech on Friday. \u201cThey love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
