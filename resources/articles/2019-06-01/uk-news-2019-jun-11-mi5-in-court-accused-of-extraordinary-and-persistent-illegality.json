The security agency has been accused of \u201cextraordinary and persistent illegality\u201d in a legal challenge brought by the human rights organisation Liberty. The failures have been identified by the official watchdog, the investigatory powers commissioner, Lord Justice Fulford, and admitted in outline by the home secretary, Sajid Javid. The full extent of the problems within MI5 became apparent in disclosures made public at the hearing on Tuesday. The revelations relate to bulk interceptions of data acquired through surveillance and hacking programmes and downloaded to its computers. The agency has a duty to ensure such material is not held longer than required or copied more often than needed. Ben Jaffey QC, for Liberty, said there were \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d in MI5\u2019s operations where it did not know what it held. In written submissions, Jaffey said: \u201cFulford\u2019s generic warrant decision notes that warrants were issued to MI5 on a basis that MI5 knew to be incorrect and the judicial commissioners [the watchdogs] were given false information.\u201d An MI5 letter sent to Fulford and released to the court showed the agency did not know what material it held. The letter said: \u201cWe are about to commence further scanning of [its computers] to ensure we have a full understanding of the data. \u201cThe full scan had been challenging to action \u2026 We have also been seeking to understand working practices \u2026 so that we can take comprehensive action to improve assurance of our compliance with relevant safeguards.\u201d Julian Milford, counsel for the Home Office and Foreign Office, told the court: \u201cWe accept that this is material that discloses compliance risks with MI5.\u201d Correspondence between Fulford and MI5 released at the hearing showed he concluded the way the agency was holding and handling people\u2019s data was \u201cundoubtedly unlawful\u201d. He said: \u201cWithout seeking to be emotive, I consider that MI5\u2019s use of warranted data \u2026 is currently, in effect, in \u2018special measures\u2019 and the historical lack of compliance \u2026 is of such gravity that [the watchdog Investigatory Powers Commissioner\u2019s Office] IPCO will need to be satisfied to a greater degree than usual that it is \u2018fit for purpose\u2019.\u201d Awareness of the problem within MI5 dated back to January 2016 but ministers were not informed until earlier this year. Fulford said MI5\u2019s description of the problem as \u201ccompliance difficulties\u201d was a \u201cmisleading euphemism\u201d. In the absence of improvements, he said, future applications by MI5 for interception warrants \u201cwill not be approved by the judicial commissioners\u201d. A response sent by MI5 to Fulford earlier this year explained: \u201cIn 2016, as part of a wider review of legal compliance in anticipation of new legislation, the \u2026 problem led the team conducting the compliance review to identify, at a high level, that data might be being held in ungoverned spaces in contravention of our policies.\u201d Megan Goulding, a lawyer with Liberty, said: \u201cThese shocking revelations expose how MI5 has been illegally mishandling our data for years, storing it when they have no legal basis to do so. This could include our most deeply sensitive information \u2013 our calls and messages, our location data, our web browsing history. \u201cIn addition to showing a flagrant disregard for our rights, MI5 has attempted to hide its mistakes by providing misinformation to the investigatory powers commissioner, who oversees the government\u2019s surveillance regime.\u201d The Green party peer, Jenny Jones, said: \u201cThis report [on MI5] has confirmed what we\u2019ve known for some time, that the security services, as well as the police, are operating their surveillance systems without accepting that they have to operate lawfully, and in a properly targeted manner. \u201cI know from my own experience of being put on the domestic extremism database that valuable security time and energy are wasted on the wrong targets.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the case \u201chighlights the failure of government legislation, which only facilitates more and more public bodies having access to and gathering information. Without proper scrutiny and oversight, the unauthorised handling and retention of data puts all our information at risk.\u201d Some of the material is thought to include exchanges between lawyers and clients that should have been protected by legal privilege. The National Union of Journalists has joined the legal challenge, which is due to be heard in full at the high court next week. The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
