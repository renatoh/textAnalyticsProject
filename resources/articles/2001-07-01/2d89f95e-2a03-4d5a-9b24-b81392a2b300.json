Thousands of Independent customers were shocked to discover after the collapse of the insurer that they had been paying monthly direct debits not to Independent but to a separate finance house instead, called Premium Credit. In effect, Premium Credit was loaning money to the customers who paid by direct debit; Premium Credit paid the full amount of the premium to Independent, and recovered it off the customers in monthly instalments. Therefore, despite the collapse of Independent and the fact that the insurance policies were worthless, Premium Credit issued letters saying that customers could not cancel their direct debits and were still obliged to make the payments. Most of Independent's monthly-instalment customers were completely unaware that Premium Credit was handling their payments; indeed, many were unaware of the existence of the company. Understandably, on hearing the news about the collapse of Independent, they cancelled direct debits and rapidly rearranged cover elsewhere, often on the advice of insurance brokers. However, this week Premium Credit said that it has agreed a deal with the liquidators to Independent, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and the Policyholders Protection Board, under which they will no longer pursue customers for payment. Instead it plans to write to customers this week, discharging them from their obligations to pay, as long as they sign agreements waiving their rights for compensation from the Policyholders Protection Board. It is understood that Premium Credit will seek to recover funds from the PPB, and if there is a shortfall, will take the loss themselves. Surprisingly, Premium Credit is unable to disclose precisely how many Independent customers will benefit, but it is believed to number tens of thousands. However, only individuals are protected; partnerships, sole traders and corporate customers will not benefit, as they do not come under the remit of the PPB. The more fortunate have simply lost insurance cover - and the premiums they have paid - but can rearrange cover elsewhere. The less fortunate are the small businesses who have made a claim on a policy or who are being sued for professional negligence, an area that Independent specialised in. Many are still awaiting payment after their business premises were flooded in last winter's storms. According to the Creditors of Independent Insurance Group - who have a website - there is a timebomb ticking away of unpaid claims that will result in the bankruptcy of many small firms. Kevin Young, managing director of Sussex-based insurance brokers Argyll and chairman of the creditors' action group, says: \"The PPB is fine for private individuals who have a claim for \u00a3250, but a commercial organisation with a \u00a34m claim outstanding that is not being paid is going to go to the wall and its employees put out of work. We know of lots of businesses suffering hardship, with many on the brink.\" The CIIG is seeking to recover the millions of pounds it says its members are owed though legal action, naming a number of potential defendants, such as Independent's directors, auditors, actuaries and the firm's rating agencies. But its principal target is expected to be the Financial Services Authority, the regulator of Independent. Stephen Alexander of Class Law, the solicitors acting on behalf of the creditors, said: \"Evidence from former employees of Independent is raining down on us in bucketloads. It is now clear that from the beginning of the year that there were serious concerns about Independent, and there are serious questions to be asked of the regulator.\" The creditors are backed by Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, who this week called for an inquiry into the handling of the collapse of Independent. \"The FSA's role must be investigated,\" he said, adding that compensation along the lines offered to victims of the Barlow Clowes scandal should be paid out if the FSA is found not to have adequately protected policyholders. Top of their concerns are reports that the FSA failed to act on a tip from French authorities six months ago that Independent Insurance was in trouble. French insurance regulator, the Commission de Controle des Assurances, put Independent's French subsidiary under \"special surveillance\" after an investigation that began last September, and banned it from taking on new business amid fears that it was under-capitalised. It also sent a report of its findings to the FSA six months ago. But an FSA spokesman said: \"We totally reject accusations that we were asleep on the job.\" It said that the French information added nothing to what the FSA already knew about Independent, and revealed that during 2000 it blocked the company's expansion until it raised new funds. Blacklisted or blackmailed? The threat of being punished for stopping payments is unjustified, says Richard Colbey Can you be blacklisted by a credit referencing agency because you refuse to bow to payment demands such as those faced by Premium Credit policyholders after the collapse of insurer Independent Insurance? When the insurer went under, thousands of homeowners immediately cancelled their direct debits to Independent and rapidly rearranged their cover elsewhere. But unknown to them, they had in fact never been making payments to Independent, but to a separate finance company which collected sums on behalf of Independent. As explained above, Premium Credit has since decided not to purse individuals who cancelled direct debits, and will not issue any more demands for payment. It also says that it will not credit blacklist those who cancelled. However, the disputed payments once again highlights the power that finance companies have to destroy individual's credit ratings. Experian, one of the major credit reference agencies, admits that finance companies are able to make direct \"adverse entries\" on to its database. An Experian spokeswoman says: \"The way our system works means that adverse entries are made directly onto our computer by the lender. We would be unhappy about any lender making a report in this situation [Independent Insurance], and if the dispute was drawn to our attention it would probably not affect the credit rating.\" There are a number of other routes by which adverse entries can be challenged. The agency can try to resolve matters itself. The Information Commissioner can make a ruling, or as a last resort a customer can sue the agency and the lender which makes the report for libel. Most people don't want to get involved in battles of that sort, with the result that many give in to unwarranted threats of blacklisting. It is not a problem that regulatory authorities have treated as a priority. And, in the absence of regulation, neither the agencies nor the finance industry have any incentive to prevent abuses. However in the case of Independent, there will be vast numbers of disputes if finance agencies do attempt to blacklist people. The cost of resolving these disputes and the fear of libel claims mean companies like Experian will probably, out of self-preservation rather than concern for consumers, ensure such entries can no longer be made directly on to their computers. A spokesman for Prompt, which financed a smaller number of Independent agreements, would not accept that its customers were entitled to refuse to pay premiums, but did however assure Jobs &amp; Money that his company will not report any defaulter to credit reference agencies. If a finance company is confident that it can justify its claims, it would be perfectly proper for them to sue for the money. But for any company to use the threat of blacklisting without testing their claim in the courts amounts, in my opinion, to blackmail. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
