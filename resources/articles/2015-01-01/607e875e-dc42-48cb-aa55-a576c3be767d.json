Was he trying to make a point here? \u201cOf course, because last week what was said was rubbish,\u201d Berahino said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people were having a go at me for not celebrating. It is not in the rules that you\u2019ve got to celebrate when you score. Loads of players don\u2019t celebrate when they score. But I\u2019m always the one getting blamed and picked out at West Brom. I just smile at it and keep my mouth shut.\u201d There is no middle ground with Berahino. He scored six in five games earlier in the season, then went 11 matches without a goal and has six in his past three appearances. As well as being in and out of form, Berahino has been charged with drink driving \u2013 the 21-year-old will appear before magistrates in Runcorn on the morning of the game at Everton a week on Monday \u2013 and accused of turning up late for matches. Life is rarely quiet with him around, although Berahino insists the reputation he has picked up is unfair. \u201cI just think everyone now, because I\u2019m almost a target out there, is trying to bring a bad name to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are always trying to write something about me, I don\u2019t understand why. I think the people who put me down, they don\u2019t know me first of all.\u201d On the pitch Berahino is back on song. Another goal, after a dreadful mix up between Allan McGregor and Ahmed Elmohamady, took Berahino\u2019s tally for the season to 14 and will do nothing to dampen speculation surrounding his future. \u201cI have big ambitions but at the moment I\u2019m a West Brom player, I\u2019m enjoying my football and I\u2019m contributing goals so I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said. Asked about the comments Tony Pulis made on the eve of this game, when the West Brom head coach said every player has his price, Berahino replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know what he is thinking. This time of the month is a difficult one. Everyone is playing a game of chess, so I\u2019m just letting my football do the talking. There are always rumours going around but, look, I can\u2019t control anything. All I can control is what I\u2019m doing on the field.\u201d After marking his first league match in charge with a win, Pulis made it clear it is his intention to find a strike partner for Berahino, rather than cash in on the club\u2019s biggest asset. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say we are not going to sell him because, if a stupid offer comes in, I would look stupid. But I\u2019ll tell you this: we are looking for another striker and, if we get another in and we keep [Berahino], that will make my day. We are desperate to get another striker to go with him.\u201d Steve Bruce, the Hull City manager, was already in the market for a centre-forward before Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hern\u00e1ndez, their top scorer and club-record signing respectively, limped off inside the opening 40 minutes, adding their names to a long injury list. Jermain Defoe is one of the players Bruce has targeted. \u201cI, like Tony Pulis and Nigel Pearson and all the people, would like a Jermain Defoe,\u201d said Bruce, whose side have slipped back into the relegation zone. \u201cThe numbers might cause a problem but then again I suppose that would be the same for most in the bottom half because he\u2019s very expensive. It might be just beyond us. The one thing you don\u2019t want to do is gamble.\u201d Man of the match Saido Berahino (WBA)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
