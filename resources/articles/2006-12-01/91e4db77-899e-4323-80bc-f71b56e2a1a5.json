That's \"estimate\" from the Latin \"estimare\", meaning \"to come up with a figure that sounds acceptable to the populace but will in reality cover only the cost of the stuffed dormice handed around as appetisers during the opening ceremony\". I don't suppose any of you have on your Christmas wishlists \"cramped, uncomfortable house with a disproportionately unwelcoming air, sold by owner who realised too late that painting the place in Dulux Matt Hopelessness probably did but aggravate the situation\"? I ask only because if the potential bill to Londoners has managed to sextuplicate in under 18 months, I think it might be time for me to sell up before Tessa Jowell wrenches the cash card from my feeble grasp and empties my bank account into a big bag marked \"government-sanctioned swag\". It's a pity Londoners don't have a sufficient sense of community to rise en masse and emigrate to anywhere else in the country for the duration, taking their council tax payments with them so that the monstrous Olympics project, already staggering and swaying like one of the town drunks tidied away into police cells during the games' committee's visits, could be put out of its misery. Otherwise, citizens will have to rely on an act of God to get them out of it, as happened in Rome almost 100 years ago when a volcanic eruption put the city out of action and the Italians had to hand over the games to, well, London, actually, but we managed quite well, mainly because in 1908 the Olympics consisted of 70 stringy Oxbridge students running gently around a cinder track discussing chemical experiments and how they were looking forward to marrying Mary when they graduated, and the whole thing cost seven and six to stage, including tea for the winners. Alas, England boasts no active volcanos, so all we can do is pray hard that the terrifyingly accelerating pace of global warming will for once afford us a mild benefit and combine with a timely failure of the Thames barrier. Or perhaps, just perhaps, we could take a leaf out of Denver's book. In 1970, they were invited to host the 1976 Winter Olympics. By 1972, concerns about the environmental damage being caused were mounting, and the projected costs had risen by 300%. While Jowell would doubtless consider this a nugatory amount, it was enough for the people of Colorado to vote against the state spending any more tax dollars to host the games. They handed the whole thing over to Innsbruck, which still had all the toboggans and skis lying around from the 1964 games, and everyone was happy. Unfortunately, 1972 was a more innocent time, before contracts - in particular ones with indemnity clauses - existed. If London were to pull out, it would still be required to sell most of the country to the IOC to cover its bribery and corruption - sorry, I mean administrative - costs. Oh, and according to the government, there is too much national pride at stake, although I suspect that a nation that can happily soak the Spanish coast in piss and vomit every summer can bear the embarrassment of passing the Olympics to France without too much psychic damage. In the meantime, if I can just find someone to buy my undes res, I think I shall move to Denver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
