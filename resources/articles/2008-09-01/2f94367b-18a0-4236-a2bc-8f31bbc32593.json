The detail will fascinate enthusiasts, as narrative and gossip are moulded by a keen sense of the politics of the movie industry and of the way that Lancaster's career both reflected and influenced its history - from his sudden leap to stardom in The Killers (1946) to his last feature, Field of Dreams (1989), which appalled the critics but which caught the \"fuzzy optimism\" of the Reagan years and became his greatest box-office hit. Buford follows him from New York slum childhood, to circus performer, to film icon, paying due attention to his troubled family life and many relationships. Convinced he never forgot his roots, she stresses his belief that everyone should be treated the same, which kept him among the more liberal of the Hollywood stars and culminated in his courageous support for early campaigns on Aids. A complex, restless man, kindly portrayed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
