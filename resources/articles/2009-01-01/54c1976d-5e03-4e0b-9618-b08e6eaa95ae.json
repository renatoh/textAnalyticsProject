The measures are among a raft of restrictions on expenses detailed in the small print of filing made by Citi on New Year's Eve with the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing was made to formalise restrictions on executive pay and bonuses that Citi's chief executive, Vikram Pandit, was forced to adopt in exchange for the US government bail-out, which includes guarantees on $306bn of troubled assets on top of $45bn of loans. In a memo to staff, Pandit said he and the chairman, Sir Win Bischoff, would forgo year-end bonuses for 2008 after the huge banking group lost three-quarters of its market value and was forced to go cap in hand to the treasury. The government was granted a stake in Citigroup in exchange for the unprecedented bail-out. \"The harsh realities of 2008, primarily our earnings results, mean that our bonus pool is dramatically lower than last year,\" Pandit wrote. \"The most senior leaders should be affected the most. That is why Win Bischoff and I will receive no bonus for 2008.\" Robert Rubin, treasury secretary under the former president Bill Clinton and now an adviser to the Citigroup board, also declined his bonus for 2008. The deal with the treasury also imposed restrictions on \"golden parachutes\". Many departing Wall Street executives have been rebuked for receiving payoffs worth tens of millions of dollars when investors lost larger sums as the banks' performances dwindled. Pandit also claimed pay would be determined by individual and company performance, and that the bank could \"claw back\" any payment made to individuals that, according to the memo, \"over time proves to be based on inaccurate financial or other information\". But much of the SEC filing is left out of Pandit's memo, such as a lengthy section on Citigroup's new agreement on staff expenses, which must remain in place as long as the US government holds its tranche of preferred stock in the banking group. Citigroup has written a new expenses policy governing the use of the company's private jet and budgets for \"entertainment and holiday parties\". The bank has also set new policies to govern expenses for travel and accommodation, office renovations, the use of contractors and the purchase or lease of real estate. If the bank wants to make any material changes to the policy, it must seek permission from the treasury. The filing also appears to list several get-out clauses that allow for executives to be paid bonuses under certain conditions and makes provisions for \"golden parachutes\" to some executives who leave the bank. The filing states that 60% of the 2008 bonus pool will be paid to top executives \"at the company's discretion\" in a combination of \"(x) deferred stock awards (all or a portion of which may be awarded in the form of stock options) or (y) deferred cash awards\". The filing also states that the remaining 40% of bonuses for top executives \"shall be granted subject to performance-based vesting\". Citigroup did not return calls seeking comment about the filing. What's in the pot Goldman Sachs, which employs about 6,000 people in the UK, has an estimated bonus pot of $2.6bn (\u00a31.73bn) \u2013 about a quarter of its total compensation and benefits bill. Morgan Stanley's compensation and benefits amounted to $12.2bn, suggesting a bonus pot of about $3bn. The pool at Merrill Lynch, which has yet to report fourth-quarter figures, is likely to amount to $3.5bn on the basis of a total compensation bill of about $13bn. At Dresdner Kleinwort, the pot is thought to be worth about \u20ac400m (\u00a3371m)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
