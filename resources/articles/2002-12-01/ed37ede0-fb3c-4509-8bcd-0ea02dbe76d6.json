Talked to Cherie about my asylum application. She was very good about helping me get my story straight. I have now told the Home Office that I cannot go back to my native Greenland because everyone there thinks I am Slobodan Milosevic's son. They seemed to buy it, even though my Greenland accent is a bit ropey. Fingers crossed. Tuesday Had another call from Tony on the scramble phone. He assured me that he was doing everything he could to expedite my asylum application before he hands over the prime ministership to Gordon Brown in January. Of course, he cannot be seen to be interfering on my behalf. I thought it best to cancel our squash date, just to be on the safe side. Wednesday Called Cherie to congratulate her on last night's speech. I wrote most of it, of course, but the tears were her idea. She still seems nervous about the whole scam, and made me promise not to say anything about being her business partner until next week. In the end, Carole had to get on the phone and hypnotise her. Wednesday I had to break it off with Ulrika yesterday, after Cherie told Carole about the affair. Ulrika very understanding, promised to help me promote my new Slimming Soap in the new year, and suggested that I sell our story to the Mail. Bad news from the States. Tests on our new anti-wrinkle miracle compound, Smoothelle, have conclusively proved that it's margarine. At least this vindicates my claim that Smoothelle is 100% non-toxic. Cherie says we can sue the lab. Thursday At last the whole \"Bristol flats\" business is dying down, and I can get on with finishing my asylum application and finding a safe Labour seat for the next election. Tony suggested Kingston Upon Hull East, but first we have to get rid of John Prescott. Luckily, I know some people who can take care of that. Called mum to tell her I was marrying Princess Anne, which made her happy. Had an idea for a bubble bath that cures cancer. Friday I think it might be time for me to be moving on. The Blair's blind trust is running low, Carole is starting to get on my nerves and Cherie is clearly losing her bottle over the budget fiddle. She seems to think Gordon is getting suspicious about her dropping by all the time. Sometimes I think I targeted the wrong wife. If my lottery grant doesn't come through by Monday, I'm out of here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
