Here are a few names...", "bodyText": "It has been a brisk week for cultural cant, fast becoming our arts minister's speciality. No sooner has Margaret Hodge done dismissing the Proms for being unrepresentative, forcing a startled defence from the Prime Minister, than she discovers the same fault with the arts. The status of women in our 'creative industries' - classic Labour oxymoron - is reprehensibly poor, Hodge claims. There are no women at the top, not nearly enough women on our arts boards and we have 'a far longer way to travel to reflect diversity than other sectors', according to this past mistress of jargon. Hodge was pronouncing from on high after a review of the Creative Leadership Programme, a \u00a312m government initiative to try to forge - or force? - a new era in the arts. Many senior figures were present, lamenting the lack of women at the top table and wondering what they could do about it. Chris Smith, who must have been half-asleep in the fug of the committee room, suggested that there might be more training programmes. Perhaps he was thinking of assertiveness training, or courses on personal gravitas, imposter syndrome and professional networking - all of them espoused, before you choke upon this sexism, by a group called Women Leaders in Museums Network. One of the aforementioned Women Leaders, Diane Lees, director designate of the Imperial War Museum, thought that we ought to start by changing the institutional environment itself. With a more 'welcoming' culture, women might rise to the top and museums would prosper under a feminine leadership style that would, she claimed, be more 'nurturing and 'consultative'. Six million years of evolution and still such primitive stereotypes! Has nobody learnt any lessons from the leadership style of Lady Thatcher? Hodge herself produced the trump clich\u00e9 - 'We must ensure that the barriers are removed!' - for which she was unctuously congratulated by Jude Kelly in the Guardian on Wednesday. Kelly, whose name is always pressed into service whenever anyone wishes to find the exception that proves the men-only rule, wrote that Margaret Hodge was 'brave' for pointing out that more women needed to reach the top in the arts. Brave? Brave is being a member of the Resistance, or sacrificing yourself to save the life of a child, not airing a view that appears to be everywhere accepted. And which, to my mind, ought not to be so unresistingly applauded. In the field of the visual arts, at the very least, Hodge is either speaking without knowledge or being led by the nose. What she means by a terrible lack of women at the top is simply a lack of women at the top of the headed notepaper - museum and gallery directors. But let's start right there. Can Hodge really mean so casually to ignore Iwona Blazwick at the Whitechapel, Julia Peyton-Jones at the Serpentine, Andrea Nixon at Tate Liverpool, Fiona Bradley at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Suzanne Cotter at Modern Art Oxford, Virginia Tandy at Manchester City Galleries? A few names, up and down the country, to counter her primitive point - and I hereby apologise to all the others I could have mentioned. And does Hodge not realise that she is making a more serious mistake, by confusing the office with power? Of course it is true that Sir Nicholas Serota remains the supreme commander of the Tate empire and thus - in respect of funding, wall space and the power to boost a public reputation, among other things - captain of this particular 'industry' in Britain. But who is in charge of what is shown, and crucially, how it is shown at Tate Modern? Two remarkable women: Frances Morris, chief curator of permanent collections, and Sheena Wagstaff, chief curator of exhibitions. I am willing to bet whatever he chooses that Stephen Deuchar, director of Tate Britain, will not disagree if I contend that Ann Gallagher and Judith Nesbitt, the two women who hold those respective posts at Millbank, have as much influence over what is shown at the museum as he has; and not just because he is modest. Conversely, I imagine that Hans Ulrich-Obrist, man about the world and co-director of exhibitions and programmes at the Serpentine, would be somewhat piqued to hear that Julia Peyton-Jones was regarded as more important than he was. And there are many other women whose authority and power in the art world are beyond question - Victoria Miro, the force behind a generation of artists, notably Peter Doig and Chris Ofili; Andrea Rose, art supremo at the British Council responsible for the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, to mention only part of her brief, and thus to a great extent how British art is perceived abroad; Amanda Sharp, co-director of Frieze Art Fair; gallery owners such as Sadie Coles in London and Susanna Beaumont in Edinburgh. I could go on - and I will. Even someone who has no expertise whatsoever in these fields (I refer to my own ignorance, not just that of Margaret Hodge) has no difficulty noticing the prowess of women directors in other art forms. Vicky Featherstone at the National Theatre of Scotland; Vikki Heywood at the RSC; Gemma Bodinetz and Deborah Aydon at the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, Rachel Kavanaugh at the Birmingham Rep, Josie Rourke at the Bush; Natalie Abrahami and Carrie Cracknell at the Gate. Amanda Neville at the BFI, Hannah McGill at the Edinburgh Film Festival, Sandra Hebron at the London Film Festival, Elaine Padmore at the Royal Opera House, Monica Mason at the Royal Ballet. And way more than half of all the art shows I saw last year were curated by women. Or do these women not count? When I joined this newspaper in 1999, a senior male colleague courteously remarked that he was glad there was a woman art critic on a broadsheet at last. The thought had not occurred to me, since I did not categorise myself that way and remain constitutionally unable to do so. I cannot speak for Jackie Wullschlager at the Financial Times or Rachel Campbell-Johnson at the Times, but I am also inclined to hope that I was not given the job of art critic simply because I was a woman. Furthermore, since two of the art writers I regularly read growing up - Marina Vaizey on the Sunday Times and Caroline Tisdall on the Guardian - were women, I assumed that one did not have to be a man to be employed to do this. When Hodge complains that there are not enough women on our museum boards - half the trustees of the Tate are women, ditto the National Portrait Gallery and others - how many does she want? And does she really think these people are more important than curators? Is the National Gallery to be chided, penalised, trained until it improves on its low proportion of women trustees? And are women to be ushered on to museum boards? My sense is that Hodge's public statements, if forced to their logical conclusion, lead inexorably to quotas. And quotas are surely not for democratic, First World countries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
