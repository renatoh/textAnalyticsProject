So much was clear this week as Gordon Brown, claiming the prize he had worked towards his entire adulthood, chose his school motto to sum up his approach to government. Hovering diffidently at the meeting-place between ideology and homily, mottos too often succumb to triteness. Kirkcaldy High's \"I will try my utmost\" (the teenage Gordon would almost certainly have learned the Latin original \"Usque conabor\") does as little to get the heart beating as the former chancellor's reforms to capital allowances on industrial plants and machinery. It is admittedly better than the opposition leader's old school motto of \"Let Eton flourish\", which serves merely as a reminder that, whatever their brand of trainers, the Tories remain unpalatably posh. Imagine, however, if Mr Brown had shaken off the dead hand of nostalgia and chosen his own bold slogan? He could have borrowed from another language, thus showing he believes in a nation of all the cultures. A man standing on the threshold of his new home with his cherished wife might have uttered the Urdu romance of \"Sitaroon se aagay jahan aur bhi hai\" (There are more worlds beyond the stars). Or, if we must use a dead language, how about Sanskrit's \"shottom shivam sundaram\"? Its assertion that truth is supremely beautiful surely rings true for any newly unspun politician. He could even have coined his own; to this newspaper, \"no more unjustified wars\" has a certain ring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
