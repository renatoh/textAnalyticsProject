To the last, it would seem, judging by The Devil's Double, which offers us a factually supercharged account of the toxic and violent relationship between Uday, Saddam's psychotic elder son, and his press-ganged doppelganger Latif Yahia. They're both played by Dominic Cooper in a batty, star-making double performance that is far more fun than the movie haphazardly slung around it. Uday's a handful, living out some Baathist-inflected fantasia on De Palma's Scarface, shooting off guns indoors, plucking schoolgirls off the streets and raping them, exercising Caligulan droit du seigneur over a war hero's new bride, prompting her suicide, and mutilating and disembowelling his own dad's food-taster at a banquet to honour Mrs Hosni Mubarak (par-TAY!). Scotch, vodka, cigars, cocaine, heroin, porn, torture, rape and murder are his toys and his games, so he's the most nightmarish playmate you can imagine. And with all these mirrors and doppelgangers, it's like a psychopathic remake of The Parent Trap. Now that the worst of the worst have finally made it to the screen, we're in a mini golden age of superviolent thrillers about megalomaniacal despots and their sleazy retinues, mass killers and deranged terrorists. Film-makers have worked their way through all the 70s middle-class revolutionary nutters: Baader-Meinhof, Carlos the Jackal (movie of the year, btw), and the hari kiri-happy Japanese Red Army. For a while now in England we've been dining on the iniquities of murderers once thought undepictable on screen \u2013 Brady and Hindley, the Yorkshire Ripper and, up next, Fred West. It was inevitable that we'd get round to the full-bore tyrants and visionary super-criminals. Like Pablo Escobar, whose blood-gorged biography makes Scarface look like Funny Face. Scarface screenwriter Oliver Stone binned his planned Escobar biopic in the face of competing projects; another, if it ends up being directed by Antoine Fuqua, will be worse than that idiotic Escobar movie made in Entourage. As for dictators, forget about the Hussein small-fry, and head for the meaty monsters: Hitler was well taken care of in Downfall, so let's see Stalin drinking his subordinates under the table as he merrily murders his people by the million. Or Mao, with his pus-filled gums, unquenchable lusts and murderous policies. Since budgetary constraints make these unlikely, I instead urge noted film-maker, supreme tyrant and lifelong entitled brat Kim Jong-il to take up his film crew, coerce the population of North Korea into extra-duty, and film his glorious autobiography posthaste."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
