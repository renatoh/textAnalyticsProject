Sarri had attempted to replace Arrizabalaga, who had briefly gone down with cramp, with Willy Caballero as the final edged into the last minute of extra time only for the 24-year-old to protest when his number was raised by the fourth official. The world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper spoke with the Chelsea defender David Luiz but waved away calls from Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, to leave the pitch while Caballero, who has a reputation as a penalty specialist, waited to be introduced. The referee eventually spoke with the head coach on the sidelines before resuming play, with a livid Sarri flinging a water bottle into his seat in frustration, ripping his tracksuit top open, then storming toward the tunnel. He returned, still livid, seconds later to watch the last few moments of the goalless stalemate. Antonio R\u00fcdiger seemed to restrain the Italian as he attempted to confront Arrizabalaga on the touchline as the teams prepared for the subsequent shootout, in which the goalkeeper saved from Leroy San\u00e9 but, critically, let a weak penalty from Sergio Ag\u00fcero squirm under his body and in as Chelsea lost 4-3. The incident came less than a week after Chelsea\u2019s supporters erupted in open revolt over the head coach\u2019s tactical approach, chanting \u201cFuck Sarriball\u201d as they slipped out of the FA Cup to Manchester United, with that mutinous mood now effectively replicated out on the pitch. Both Sarri, encouraged by his team\u2019s display even in defeat, and Arrizabalaga attempted to portray the furore as \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d, for all that the head coach admitted the player\u2019s conduct had been poor. \u201cI was really angry, but I understood he had cramp, and I didn\u2019t want the goalkeeper to go to penalties in that physical condition,\u201d he said. \u201cI realised the situation only after three or four minutes when the doctor arrived on the bench. I wanted Caballero on the pitch, but the goalkeeper wanted to let me know he was in condition to go to penalties. It was only a big misunderstanding. Kepa was right, but in the wrong way \u2013 wrong in the way he conducted himself, but mentally he was right because he was able to go to penalties. He was right for his motivation, but not for the conduct.\u201d Head coach and goalkeeper spoke post-match. \u201cIn no moment was it my intention to disobey the boss,\u201d said Arrizabalaga. \u201cIt was misunderstood. I know if you see it from outside, it is not the best image. I have spoken with the boss. I think it was misunderstood. I understand that on television, on social media, they\u2019re talking about this but it wasn\u2019t my intention to go against the manager. We have spoken now, and I was only trying to say I\u2019m fine. He thought I wasn\u2019t fine. It was in tense moments, with a lot happening. I know the image it\u2019s given, but I never intended to refuse to go off. It was only to say I was fine.\u201d Caballero saved three penalties while a City player in the 2016 final, against Liverpool, and helped Chelsea prevail in a shootout in the third round of the FA Cup against Norwich last season. \u201cI know how good Willy Caballero is on penalties,\u201d said the victorious captain, Vincent Kompany. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to come on. It didn\u2019t happen in the end.\u201d City\u2019s victory maintained the team\u2019s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies, though Pep Guardiola bemoaned the loss of Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte to muscle injuries which could keep them on the sidelines \u201cfor weeks\u201d. Sarri, whose future as head coach had been cast into serious doubt just seven months into a three-year contract by recent humiliating defeats, insisted he remains in control of his squad despite the Arrizabalaga incident and should remain in charge for Wednesday\u2019s Premier League visit of Tottenham. \u201cIf you saw the match you can understand very well that, today, the players played exactly the match we prepared,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cSo I think I am in control, fully in control of the situation. \u201cYou have to ask the club [about the future], but I am really very happy because my feeling is that we are improving and could become a very solid team. We conceded nothing to Manchester City, the best team in Europe, and I saw the match on the pitch that I prepared.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
