The 20-year-old Wiggle Honda Pro Cycling team rider completed the 21km morning time trial on day three 39 seconds faster than Jolanda Neff (Rabobank-Liv/Giant), who had taken the jersey from her on the previous stage. After finishing fifth in the afternoon's 77.3km road stage Trott now sits three seconds behind her rival. \"It's all going in the right direction,\" said the Wiggle team's sporting director, Simon Cope. Trott moved up to 15th place in the general classification, with her team-mates Dani King \u2013 a fellow Olympic champion \u2013 and Lauren Kitchen in 17th and 20th positions respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
