After a rocky start to the general election campaign in which Jacob Rees-Mogg had to apologise for his comments about victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, and the Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, resigned, footage emerged of the prime minister regaling businesses with the benefits of his deal. The video, shot on Thursday night in Northern Ireland, showed him reassuring worried exporters they will not have to fill in customs declarations when they send goods across the Irish Sea. In answer to a question from an exporter about whether his business would have to complete extra forms, Johnson said: \u201cYou will absolutely not.\u201d He recommended that if any business is asked to fill in such paperwork, they should telephone the prime minister \u201cand I will direct them to throw that form in the bin\u201d. That appeared to flatly contradict the Brexit secretary, who gave testimony to the House of Lords recently that businesses would need to complete \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d when sending shipments from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: \u201cThis is a prime minister who either doesn\u2019t know the details of the deal he has negotiated or isn\u2019t being straight about it. \u201cIf this deal comes into force, it\u2019s an international treaty that will be legally binding. It\u2019s not for Boris Johnson to waive or ignore the obligations in the deal he has negotiated. Boris Johnson\u2019s making it up as he goes along. This is no way to seek to run the country.\u201d Under Johnson\u2019s revised withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU customs code, which includes customs declarations and other formalities. But answering questions after a rambling speech that was captured on video and went viral, the PM said: \u201cThere will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind. You will have unfettered access.\u201d His remarks were met with incredulity in the European parliament. The Dutch MEP Sophie in \u2019t Veld said: \u201cHe has been deceiving the public repeatedly on Brexit \u2026 The best deal Britain has is the special one it has now as a full member of the EU.\u201d Martin Schirdewan, a German leftwing member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said Johnson had \u201conly a very vague idea\u201d of the withdrawal agreement. \u201cHe either doesn\u2019t understand or is playing electoral politics with people\u2019s livelihoods. It is irresponsible either way.\u201d Johnson was also ridiculed for hailing the benefits for Northern Ireland of an arrangement that will leave it more closely tied to the EU than he is prepared to allow for the rest of the UK. \u201cActually, Northern Ireland has got a great deal. You keep free movement, you keep access to the single market and, as it says in the deal, unfettered access to the UK,\u201d he said. By free movement he was apparently referring to the common travel area on the island of Ireland. The issue of customs arrangements goes to the heart of the collapse of the government\u2019s relations with the Democratic Unionist party, which has described the Brexit deal as a disgrace and a betrayal because of the new paperwork local businesses selling goods to Great Britain will be required to complete. On a visit to a Tayto crisp factory in Tandragee, County Armagh, on Thursday, Johnson insisted his critics had got the wrong end of the stick. \u201cThere will not be checks, and I speak as the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and a passionate unionist. There will not be checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain because we\u2019re the government of the United Kingdom and we will not institute or implement or enact such checks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that Tayto crisps from Tandragee are going to be vetted by some process is just nonsense.\u201d While there are no physical checks involved in the special Northern Ireland arrangements apart from anti-smuggling controls led by intelligence, the new paperwork that must accompany transiting goods is seen by critics including the DUP as tantamount to erecting a trade barrier between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The campaign visit was one of the few opportunities Johnson has had to stray off script in a series of carefully-controlled events, including Wednesday night\u2019s US-style rally in Birmingham. He has been relentlessly hammering home the message that only his party can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but the row over customs forms underlined the risk of becoming bogged down in the details of his deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
