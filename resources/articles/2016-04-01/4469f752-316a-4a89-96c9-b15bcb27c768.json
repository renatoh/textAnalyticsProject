It tells the story of five young people in New York, with Eisenberg playing the toxic Ben, who is nasty to everyone including his earnest Nepalese room mate Kalyan, played by The Big Bang Theory\u2019s Kunal Nayyar. Eisenberg said he was \u201cthrilled, honoured and nervous\u201d to be bringing the play to London. \u201cLike New York, London is a very discerning audience, they are as theatre-savvy as the people on stage. I\u2019m as nervous as I was for the New York production \u2026 it feels like starting over again.\u201d The off-Broadway run last summer brought good reviews, with the New York Times calling it \u201cengrossingly acted, impeccably staged\u201d and Alexis Soloski in the Guardian praising its wordplay, moral outrage and wealth of cringe humour. Eisenberg said The Spoils was about \u201chow these five young people can coexist in a complicated, heterogenous world of the big city. At the centre of the play is an angry young guy who feels alienated in this group.\u201d That is Eisenberg\u2019s character, and the actor hopes he provides a glimpse into \u201cthe mind of the destructive friend\u201d. He added: \u201cEveryone has a friend like this, or at least an enemy like this, and I suppose if they were to invest their time and energy into investigating that person\u2019s mind, they would probably walk away feeling sympathetic.\u201d Eisenberg wrote the play about four years ago when he was in a somewhat darker place than he is today. \u201cThe play is very personal but it is not autobiographical,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feelings are real, the circumstances are not. \u201cWhat I want to do is create characters that seem difficult to like, but by virtue of me writing them and me playing them, I try to humanise them and sympathise with them and hopefully create a portrait of a person that is much more complicated.\u201d It is the third play Eisenberg has written and starred in, and he admitted he preferred to do his own plays. In 2005, he appeared with Al Pacino in a workshop of the play Orphans in Los Angeles. \u201cIt rattled me so much, acting in theatre consumes me so much during a run that I now prefer to just wait until my plays are getting done. I just find it such a taxing experience. \u201cI treat every performance like it is the most important one. Every day to me is gearing up for the best performance I\u2019ll ever do \u2013 even if it\u2019s a Tuesday night and the house is half full, I still treat it like it\u2019s the most important performance I\u2019ll do in my life. I don\u2019t know any other way to do it, I don\u2019t know any shortcuts. \u201cMy complaint about live theatre is that it\u2019s at 8pm. I wish it was 10am so I could do the play and get on with my day. It is so frustrating \u2026 the anticipation and worry is worse than anything else, the days are just the killers.\u201d Eisenberg\u2019s breakthrough role was playing the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network, and he said doing movies gave him a lot of time off that he often spent writing. As well as plays, Eisenberg has written humorous pieces for the New Yorker and a collection of short stories, Bream Gives Me Hiccups, for which he is soon to direct a TV pilot. He was in London last week and saw The Maids at Trafalgar Studios, a space that he said was ideal for The Spoils. \u201cNot only is it a cool place to watch plays, it feels intense and intimate.\u201d The Spoils begins previews on 27 May and runs until 13 August. Tickets go on sale on Thursday at 10am."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
