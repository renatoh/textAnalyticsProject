Accommodation in the big cities is easy to find and book. Outside, you should expect to deal directly with the owner and be prepared to use simple English in your emails: German is the most commonly spoken foreign language. In cities If you only bookmark one site about eastern Europe, make it In Your Pocket (inyourpocket.com). It covers everything from the seedier clubs of Vilnius to Moldova. Equally good, if not better, is the Web's Best Baltic Tourist Guide (balticsww.com/tourist/). Cracow-life.com and Krakow-info.com are both good introductions, although the latter is a little overawed. There is a page of pithy restaurant reviews at fema.krakow.pl/~restaura/rrev_en.htm . Tristan Miller's Budapest Restaurant Reviews (nothingisreal.com/budapest) and the Big List O'Budapest Restaurants ( orie.cornell.edu/~aarcher/Budapest/all.html ) are worth a visit. Most of the usual sites (hotels.com; placestostay.com; onlinetravel.com) can set you up with a city hotel room. Try travelintelligence.net/wsd/hotels/ for top-end recommendations and cheapaccommodation.com for hostels. Bratislavahotels.com is an obliging accommodation agency. The two Nordic Hotels (nordichotels.ee) - one of which opens in May - and the Three Sisters Hotel in Tallinn and the Hotel Josef in Prague (designhotels.com) are the closest you are likely to get to a boutique hotel. In the countryside It is not for the faint-hearted - but the Hungarian Centre of Rural Tourism ( datanet.hu/ftur/index_a.html ) lists plenty of B&amp;Bs and their gastronomic specialities ('cabbage in jug', 'goose-mush', 'fried sheeptail' and the like). If you're looking for a boarding-house or a mountain hotel in Slovakia, travelguide.sk may be of help; for Poland, try visit.pl or the farms at poland.eceat.org/members.htm . Slovenia-tourism.si is a good, if slow, resource. Romania's online tourist offering leaves much to be desired, but there is a half-decent guide to the Brasov region at brasovtravelguide.ro. ros.taylor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
