It feels like an apt one too. Modern townhouses are being built in the area next to the city\u2019s dockside, which is being sold as \u201cHull\u2019s new modern and exciting regeneration development\u201d. There are temporary gallery spaces, workshops and dance classes, and cheap artist studios are being built. It is the kind of arts-led regeneration that has come to urban areas like the Northern Quarter in Manchester, Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Chueca in Madrid. But this is different. This is Hull. A place whose name alone supposedly conjures images of \u201cunspecified post-industrial misery\u201d, king of the so-called \u201cCrap Towns\u201d and the bete noire of property expert Kirstie Allsopp \u2013 who deemed Hull the UK\u2019s worst place to live in 2005. But Humber Street is a sign of progress and a rebranded city: a place buoyed by successful, year-long City of Culture celebrations that happened in 2017. If Hull has its swagger back, there\u2019s good reason. The numbers that surrounded Hull\u2019s City of Culture were impressive: \u00a3219m of investment, 800 jobs created and 95% of residents who said they participated in at least one event. The bid\u2019s volunteer scheme attracted thousands who continue to give their time at art events around the city. And data released to the Guardian by the University of Hull\u2019s Culture, Place and Policy Institute suggests there has been a lasting effect: in 2018 and early 2019 there has been an 11% increase in attendance at culture events in the city and surrounding area. Tourism has seen a lift, a 15% increase in trips to the city compared 2016 figures. Katy Fuller is the outgoing chief executive of Absolutely Cultured, the charity that grew out of the company which ran City of Culture and is now charged with securing its legacy. She says that after the high of 2017 \u2013 when more than 450 pieces were commissioned \u2013 there needs to be a readjustment. \u201cOne of the things we keep talking about is sustainability over the long term. And changing from the mindset of 2017 being this explosion of activity and it acting as a catalyst for change, to keeping that momentum going at a sustainable rate over the next 10, 20, 30 years.\u201d One of the keys to that success will be money. Fuller admits that funding the arts after the legacy money from the City of Culture has run out will be difficult (Absolutely Cultured had an ambitious fundraising target of \u00a311m, which has now been revised) but thinks 2017 helped local artists and groups learn how to access arts money. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard, but one of the things that has changed now is there\u2019s been a huge leap in applications for Arts Council funding from individual artists and smaller theatre groups,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the confidence now to go for that money.\u201d Art Council bids have grown. There were 15 awards in 2013/14 for Hull-based National Lottery Project Grants worth a total of \u00a3151,305. In 2018/19 that rose to 24 projects worth \u00a31,098,273, plus there was a 21% increase for Hull-based arts groups in the Arts Council\u2019s national portfolio funding between 2018-2022. One group that has proved resourceful when it comes to making the arts pay is Back To Ours, which receives funding from Absolutely Cultured and the Arts Council. Focusing on taking live events to communities that don\u2019t traditionally have access to the arts in venues including school halls and social clubs, its founder Louise Yates moved from Leeds 12 years ago and fell in love with Hull\u2019s unpretentious arts scene. \u201cIt seemed like a bad boyfriend at first, you mention it to family and they\u2019d say \u2018Ohhh \u2026 why are you going over there\u2019,\u201d she says. Inspired by the rural touring model, Yates has turned Back to Ours into a success story with soldout events that mix savvy commissioning (Black Grape playing in a council estate shopping centre, for example) with more challenging works of experimental theatre. \u201cThey\u2019re going to a venue that doesn\u2019t really host acts so they\u2019re taking a bit of a risk, and we\u2019re aiming for new audiences,\u201d says Yates. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no idea how they\u2019re going to react.\u201d But amid the progress and developments there is a sense of fear. A concern shared by many is that all this could be ephemeral. That once the City of Culture legacy funding runs out, the short-term boom could lead to mid- to long-term malaise, with the city\u2019s residents expecting the big, mass-participation events that characterised 2017 but are expensive to host. Situated on Beverley Road next to a Kurdish restaurant and down the road from a methadone clinic, Ground is a world away from the sheen of Humber Street. Founded 18 months before the City of Culture celebrations began, Ground sat outside the City of Culture bid\u2019s orbit. Run by a group of former art students who are mostly from Hull, but also include a Londoner and a couple of Danes, they took over a charity\u2019s old shop front and converted it into a gallery-meets-community centre space, with artist studios on its upper floors. A place like Ground, with its low running costs and charity-based beginnings, would probably always have existed with or without the City of Culture in 2017. Ground-based artists Ella Dorton and Lilly Williams do share some concerns about the way the City of Culture focused on artists from outside the city. \u201cIt was really disproportionate how much was spent on artists coming in from outside of Hull and doing big spectaculars that last for half an hour, compared to money that was going into organisations that already exist and are doing good stuff,\u201d says Dorton. \u201cThere was a sense from a lot of locals that there wasn\u2019t anything there for them really,\u201d says Brian, who volunteers at Ground. \u201cIt was like a rebranding, marketing exercise \u2013 it\u2019s not really about culture. The money they raised was around \u00a330m, and they spent that in one year. They could have spent \u00a31m a year and it would have lasted for a generation.\u201d If some of the grassroots groups did feel excluded from the City of Culture process, perhaps those dots are being joined up now. Dorton has a show at Humber Street Gallery, whose new boss John Heffernan has put a focus on local artists and more experimental works, such as Cut \u2013 a sound and sculpture installation, which involves people\u2019s conversations with hairdressers being recorded. According to Franco Bianchini, the director of the Culture, Place and Policy Institute, that is the kind of challenging commissioning and radical thinking the city will need to prosper artistically well beyond 2017. \u201cHull has to do something special,\u201d says Bianchini, who says it has stiff competition from other culture-rich northern cities such as Leeds and York. \u201cThe school of arts and design has been cut significantly, and it\u2019s really important that new ideas emerge in the city and then stay in the city. Retention of creative talent is key.\u201d With the Humber Street developments the infrastructure to support that talent exists, and Hull has proved it is up for a fight, but now it\u2019s not three-word slogans that people are starting to focus on \u2013 it\u2019s just one word: legacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
