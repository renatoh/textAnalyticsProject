His brain's obviously been addled by one too many Tooheys. Has he not sat for an entire day until his arse goes numb staring at the rain trickling down the windows of his hostel? Has he not been blown from pillar to post around the streets of Wellington by the hurricane gales? Has he not marvelled at the complete lack of anything to do that doesn't involve getting cold, wet and/or injured? If you're still determined to go (and I'm sure they'll let you change your ticket even at this late stage) just make sure you pop into Woolies first and pick up a large supply of books. And some mittens. Have fun with your mum. Simon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
