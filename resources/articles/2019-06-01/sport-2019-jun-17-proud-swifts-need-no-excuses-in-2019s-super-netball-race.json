When presented with the chance to speak to any of the league\u2019s eight captains, most media gravitated to Collingwood recruit Geva Mentor, Silver Fern and Sunshine Coast superstar Laura Langman, Diamonds and Fever keeper Courtney Bruce or gutsy Melbourne Vixens leader, Kate Moloney. All the talk was about a Lightning three-peat or black and white domination. As people milled around the cavernous function space in North Melbourne back in mid-April, 25-year-old Proud, one of the youngest captains in the league, at times stood alone. That\u2019s because after missing finals in the first two seasons of Super Netball \u2013 and retaining an almost-unchanged roster heading into the third \u2013 the Swifts were meant to be the also-rans of 2019; the tough battlers that weren\u2019t up to it, again. A side synonymous with inconsistency, the same was foreseen this season. In Super Netball\u2019s first year in 2017, the Swifts won only three games, finishing sixth out of eight. Then last season, with former Swift Briony Akle replacing Rob Wright as coach, they won five of their first seven games and looked set to play finals, before spectacularly falling in a hole and winning just one more for the year. They eventually finished sixth again. Akle though, stuck with her group \u2013 namely the young Australian defensive pairing of Sarah Klau and Maddy Turner, a shooting combination of English Rose Helen Housby and Trinidadian Sam Wallace, along with Proud and Paige Hadley in the midcourt \u2013 the latter who had been dropped from the national side. English attacker Natalie Haythornthwaite, shooter Sophie Garbin and defenders Kate Eddy and Lauren Moore made up the numbers, rounding them out as a solid, but unspectacular line up. Despite most of the group having multiple years together, the raw and established talent in the team and the Instagram-worthy close personal bonds, few expected much. Wallace wasn\u2019t ever put in the same sentence as Jhaniele Fowler or Romelda Aiken, the defensive pair wasn\u2019t considered fearsome enough and the midcourt didn\u2019t match what Collingwood had with Madi and Kelsey Browne, Kim Ravaillion and Ash Brazill. Oh, and they didn\u2019t have a single current Diamond. In virtually every pre-season discussion this year, pundits had the foundation NSW team towards the bottom of the ladder \u2013 and rarely anywhere near the top. In a player survey for News Limited, no side, except the Swifts themselves, had them inside the four. Proud knew as much, saying at the launch that her side expected to be written off. \u201cPeople definitely do (underestimate us),\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened in the last few years; we have had that inconsistency. We\u2019ll be able to show glimpses of brilliance and we\u2019ll be so good for one game and then we\u2019ll kind of not come to play, pretty much, the next week. For us, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve gone away and tried to work on; really focusing on that consistency, to be able to bring 100 percent effort every single week.\u201d Proud said the group, while still one of the youngest and most inexperienced in the competition, would make no excuses in 2019. And, as it\u2019s turned out, they don\u2019t need to. Although Proud succumbed to an ACL injury last week, ending her season, after eight rounds and seven wins \u2013 including an incredible four-goal come-from-behind win over the Giants late yesterday \u2013 the Swifts sit comfortably atop the Super Netball ladder. They\u2019re 10 points clear of back-to-back premiers the Sunshine Coast Lightning, the only side to beat them so far this year, on 53 points. The Vixens, who accounted for a depleted Queensland Firebirds by 11, are third. The Swifts\u2019 buffer is helped by a whopping 25 bonus points, awarded for winning a quarter. That means they\u2019ve \u201clost\u201d just seven quarters from 32 since late April. And they\u2019ve done it by playing as a team; with and for each other. While 193cm Wallace is the second-most prolific shooter in the league, sitting on 360 goals at 94% accuracy, behind Fever\u2019s Fowler on 415 and 95% accuracy, the Swifts don\u2019t dominate any key statistical metrics; only matches. Klau ranks fourth for the most deflections so far this season, with 38, well behind Shamera Sterling\u2019s 71. And she has 20 less intercepts than leader, Lightning\u2019s Karla Pretorius, who put in a stunning performance in her side\u2019s 23-goal demolition of Collingwood on Saturday. Twenty-four year-old Klau ranks fifth for most defensive rebounds, eight behind Collingwood captain Mentor, and neither shooter makes the cut for most offensive rebounds \u2013 mainly because they don\u2019t miss much, shooting at a combined 91% accuracy. In the midcourt, Hadley sits fifth for most goal assists, behind her injured team mate Proud, who is third, but still 65 behind Vixens and Diamonds wing attack Liz Watson, on 224. Housby, who is averaging 18 goals a game, is fourth for most centre pass receives, on 178; a clear demonstration of the work she does outside the circle. If there was a metric for creativity, work rate and pure grunt, she\u2019d be leading it. The most valuable player awards tell a similar story. In the Swifts\u2019 seven wins, four different players have taken out the post-match award. Like cogs in a machine, it\u2019s the cumulative efforts of the Swifts which have seen them become the highest scoring team, on 516 goals, and the measliest defence, allowing just 427 goals \u2013 or about 13 a quarter. They\u2019re on track to surpass the Fever\u2019s 2018 season tally of 912 goals, but unlike Fever, it\u2019s not down to one shooter or one superstar defender. The West Australians currently sit sixth on the ladder after a one-goal win over Adelaide on Saturday. The fact Klau and Hadley were named in the Australian Diamonds squad for July\u2019s World Cup tells the story of the rise and rise of the Swifts. But now the question arises, can they maintain it or do old habits die hard? In the last round before the World Cup-enforced break next weekend, the Swifts should easily account for the lowly-placed Thunderbirds. After the five-week break for the tournament, they have the toughest road trip in netball, to Perth to play West Coast Fever. If they can re-capture their current form and go all the way in September, maybe a few more people will want time with Maddy Proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
