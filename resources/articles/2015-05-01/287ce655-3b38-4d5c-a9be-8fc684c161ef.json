While recognising the potential for development agencies and private businesses to work together to boost livelihoods in the developing world, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said these collaborations must identify more clearly how they will benefit the poor. DfID has described its partnerships with the private sector as an \u201cengine of growth\u201d. But the study, which was released on Thursday, said the department must \u201cwork with businesses which want to invest in developing countries in such a way as to maximise benefits for the poor\u201d. The watchdog gave DfID an amber-red rating \u2013 its second worst \u2013 for its work with businesses. Icai\u2019s report assessed the impact of DfID\u2019s work with private sector firms on economic and human development, environmental sustainability and humanitarian assistance. Graham Ward, Icai\u2019s chief commissioner, said: \u201c[DfID has] clearly stated their intention to work more with business and there are great potential benefits for the poor from this collaboration. We are concerned, however, about how DfID will translate these goals into practical actions without more strategic oversight of business engagement activities and without concrete targets.\u201d This year, DfID is projected to ramp up its financing to private sector firms \u2013 in the form of loans, equity investments and guarantees \u2013 to an estimated \u00a3580m, up from \u00a368m in 2012, the report said. Between 2012 and 2015, DfID spent about \u00a3494m of its budget on alliances, financing and partnerships with UK and foreign businesses, the study said. Examples of these relationships include the Business Action for Africa network; the Safety, Health and Education and Employment for Girls and Women alliance; a partnership with Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor; and the Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund. Poor leadership has made the development objectives behind DfID\u2019s private sector partnerships unclear, according to Icai. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the sense that this new and really important agenda is being steered by senior management,\u201d said a spokesman for the watchdog. Part of the problem is that DfID\u2019s poverty reduction targets are out of sync with the profit-making imperative fundamental to private business. The financial incentives for businesses to work with DfID mean that the agency must agree with private sector partners on reachable targets, the study said. This is further complicated by DfID\u2019s remit to reduce poverty in the world\u2019s most fragile countries, which often have challenging business environments, the study warned. An Icai spokesman said: \u201cThe markets that most business are going to be interested in are going to be in the more developed countries. The very poorest countries, by definition, are going to offer slim pickings for businesses, and therefore there\u2019s going to be less opportunity for DfID to do this direct engagement with [businesses].\u201d According to the report, DfID\u2019s spending on challenge funds \u2013 competitions for funding \u2013 is particularly problematic. \u201cIn some cases \u2026 we are not confident that DfID\u2019s support is additional to what businesses would have done anyway, especially in the case of challenge funds,\u201d the report said. The report echoes criticism by some NGOs, who say DfID\u2019s private sector partnerships don\u2019t translate into development gains. \u201cThis report raises serious questions about DfID\u2019s ideological drive to work more and more with the private sector when there\u2019s so little evidence of the development benefits,\u201d said Polly Jones, head of policy and campaigns at Global Justice Now. Beck Wallace, a private sector policy analyst at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: \u201cDfID needs a clear oversight mechanism in place when working with private firms that goes beyond just cash flow and considers who bears which of the economic, social and environmental costs, risks and benefits of projects. By identifying specifically what value it adds to partnerships with private firms, DfID can help drive forward thinking about how best to deliver poverty reduction through profit-making enterprises.\u201d The report did not take into account spending by the UK\u2019s CDC Group, formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation, or the Private Infrastructure Development Group, in which DfID invests. Icai said this is because the UK\u2019s National Audit Office (NAO) has recently reviewed PIDG\u2019s spending. The NAO had been scheduled to review CDC\u2019s spending, but this review has since been cancelled, Icai said. A DfID spokesman said: \u201cOur relationship with business has never been closer and this is delivering real results, whether working with the London Stock Exchange to boost markets in Africa, partnering with Unilever to set up social enterprises that improve the lives of millions of people, or getting new vaccines to market quickly and safely.\u201d He added: \u201cThis report comes a year into our groundbreaking new strategy and only reviews a small cross-section of our work. It would be wrong to rush to conclusions on projects that are intended to deliver over a five- to 10-year timeframe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
