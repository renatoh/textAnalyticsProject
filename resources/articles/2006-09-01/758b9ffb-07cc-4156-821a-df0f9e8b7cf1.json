Gaddafi: A Living Myth created an extraordinary buzz of anticipation before its opening night, more media interest than the company can ever remember for a production. Its first night was an \"event\": le bon ton came out in force, from celebrity architects to publishing moguls. And the result? A naive, dumbfoundingly literal march through 20th- and 21st-century Libyan history. A piece that was extraordinarily untheatrical, about whose characters one cared nothing, whose pacing was stultifyingly unvarying and whose music struggled to sustain its two-hour length. It was saved from looking a complete turkey by some very good performances (notably Ramon Tikaram in the lead) and the virtuosity of ENO's technical team. The obvious parallel to Gaddafi - a work of music theatre on the life of a famous world leader - is John Adams's masterpiece Nixon in China, given a wonderful revival recently by ENO. In terms of sophistication, wit, imagination and emotional depth, there is, alas, no comparison. What's depressing about this is that it feels like a case of one struggling and unfashionable artform piggy-backing off the trendiness of another. It's a trade: ENO gets to be perfumed by hip-hop's cool, whereas ADF gets to experiment with a different form on a national stage. Nor would the trade-off be unacceptable if it seemed as if making the work had been an artistic necessity. But it didn't. If the writers had any notion of the theatre, had anything that urgently needed to be said on the lyric stage, then it was lost on me. Indeed, it was hardly as if ADF had been haunting opera houses for years, dreaming of a commission: the idea that Steve Savale of ADF's interest in Gaddafi should be converted into an opera came not from him, but from an impresario, Alex Poots, briefly the head of contemporary arts at ENO. To be clear, the argument here is not that artists working in other forms should somehow be prevented from working in opera, or that opera should be kept pure for the members of an exclusive inner circle. Some of the most memorable interventions in lyric theatre have been from artists known primarily for other media: the Quay Brothers' designs; Mark Morris's choreography; Auden's libretto for The Rake's Progress; Minghella's direction of Madam Butterfly. The observation is simply this: ENO's attitude that ADF should be brought in to brighten or shake up opera smells of cynicism rather than artistic conviction. Worse than that, it smells of fear. John Berry, the artistic director of ENO, last week said that the word \"opera\" was a major problem with audiences, and that word has been suppressed in marketing the project. At the same time, he hopes that at least \"a handful\" of the new audiences brought to the Coliseum by Gaddafi will return to see more traditional works. But if you imagine that new audiences will come to the Coliseum only for \"not-opera\", surely it is illogical to believe that they will return for what you bill incontrovertibly as opera? And if you, the management of the national opera company, contend that opera is such a bitter pill to swallow that it has to be disguised, if you have such little confidence in the artform, then why, bluntly, should anyone else be interested in it? No one doubts the right, indeed the duty, of ENO to experiment, to evolve the artform, to widen the pool of artists with whom it works - and to fail honourably, from time to time, in doing that. But Gaddafi: A Living Myth is, alas, a phoney. \u00b7 Charlotte Higgins is a Guardian arts correspondent charlotte.higgins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
