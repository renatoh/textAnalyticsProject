One year after Trump was booed at the conservative Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio \u201ca clown\u201d, the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and same-sex marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy. For Trump, school choice, which he advocated in a speech on Thursday, was a needed innovation. \u201cThe education can\u2019t get worse,\u201d he said while also pledging to \u201ccampaign to get the states to reallocate another $110bn of their education budgets to school choice programs\u201d. Speaking from teleprompters, it served as a pointed contrast to his speech a year ago which seemed to focus on the importance of saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d instead of \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d. This year, Trump was still not a natural in front of a crowd of ardent social conservatives, even once referring to attendees as \u201cyou people\u201d. Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States, a major cause of concern for evangelicals Christians who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East. Not mentioned was Trump\u2019s own refugee policy, which would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States. Trump did seem to recognize that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical. At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson amendment, which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their tax-exempt status, was the only way he could get into heaven. But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed: \u201cHillary Clinton is unfit to be president.\u201d The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorne hat in support. The Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented. Even the far-right John Birch Society had a table in the group\u2019s exhibition hall. But Trump\u2019s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party, a group that has long been uncomfortable with the party\u2019s nominee, and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz during the primary. Dylan Miller, a rising community college freshman from north-west Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem maniacal\u201d, the teenager said, contrasting Friday\u2019s speech to the Republican nominee\u2019s frequent televised performances. Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump \u201cbecause he wasn\u2019t Hillary\u201d but Trump\u2019s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote. Another attendee, Sarah Ocker, a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma, said she was closer to voting for Trump after his speech. She said that she \u201cagreed with a lot\u201d of what Trump said, particularly about \u201creligious liberty\u201d. But Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and couldn\u2019t commit to voting for him, although she was \u201choping\u201d she could find a reason to do soby November. Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas, was further along in the process. Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump, but after Trump granted him and other Christians a private meeting in New York, as well as seeing his speech on Friday, Lewis said he was enthusiastic. \u201cHe is a very gentle guy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
