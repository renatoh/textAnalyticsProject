I remember thinking it had gone well; Hattersley was genial, amusing, thought-provoking on the subject of Tony Blair's future relationship with his party, and able to finish the interview with a resigned but good-humoured remark about the plight of Sheffield Wednesday FC. One or two comments came in from listeners agreeing or disagreeing with him, but none was outraged. Then, 20 minutes later, while I was chatting about the future of formula one sponsorship, came a brief but direct email from Martin. I think his name was Martin. Martin called Hattersley something I could neither read out then nor type out now, and then added - charmingly - \"typical of you, nancy-boy Worricker, to have him on\". In these days of immediate communication, Martin's outburst is not that unusual. I don't mean I'm called a \"nancy boy\" on a daily basis, but it's now a simple case of a listener sending an email or a text message and the likes of me reading it straight away live on air. And I mean straight away. At the click of a mouse, the computer screen can revert from programme scripts to emails and text messages, the latter appearing on a website that clicks around at an alarming rate like the football scores at 4.45pm on a Saturday. While the team monitoring incoming correspondence tries its best to sift out the ones most likely to deflate the presenter's fragile ego, most slip through the net. So hello, Martin, thanks for your interest. A number of things occur to me. Do the Martins of this world realise that I'll be reading his email as soon as he sends it, or does he anticipate that it will be weeded out by a phalanx of anxious assistants long before it comes anywhere near me? And does he realise that we've all got his email address as a result? And what does he expect me to do? Break down on air, declare I can't carry on, and retire there and then, only to reappear months later on an obscure Gold station, talking over the lyrics of REO Speedwagon? Surely he realises we're all made of sterner stuff. Not that Martin's stamina is to be discounted. The interview with Hattersley lasted more than 10 minutes, but presumably Martin sat through it all. He obviously hated it, but something drove him not only to endure the whole grubby encounter, but then to enter into correspondence about it afterwards. Why didn't he just go and clean the car, mow the lawn, read the paper, even turn the radio to another channel? While there is a serious side to all this, Martin enlivened my day no end. I was tempted to reply, but I didn't reckon a lengthy correspondence would achieve a great deal. In the past, when I've risked a response, I've learned that the most effective approach is to be excessively polite. If someone has taken the trouble to call me every name under the sun, there's nothing more disarming than a fawning apology in which I emphasise how mortified I am to have ruined his or her day. On one occasion, I remember sending just such a response, which prompted an even more fawning apology from someone saying he had no idea I got to read the emails personally and that if he had known he would never have called me a wanker. That made me feel so much better. All this requires us frail radio presenters to have thicker skins, or at least a more immediate ability to fend off moments of self- doubt. Gone are the days when a letter - traditionally written in green ink - took days to arrive, by which time the criticism, however harsh, had usually lost its potency. However, when they are sent, they can still pack a punch. Last year, while presenting 5 Live breakfast, I mentioned in passing that a fox was regularly visiting my garden shed and had turned the cushion of a garden chair into a combination of a bed and a toilet. I said that I had secured the shed so that the fox couldn't get in any more, and as I fended off some good-natured studio banter alleging animal cruelty, I didn't give it another thought. But one woman certainly did. A few days later a seven-page letter arrived unveiling a number of adjectives I had never encountered before, which left me in no doubt that she thought I wasn't fit to be scraped off the sole of her shoe. Having unleashed all this vitriol, she then added: \"PS - I hope I've spelled your surname correctly.\" It was a nice touch, and I don't suppose she'd have bothered with it if she'd written an email or a text message. And she didn't write in green. So Martin, next time you get in touch, hark back to the old days when newsrooms contained typewriters and reel-to-reel tape recorders... and put it in a letter. Your human side might just come out. \u00b7 Julian Worricker presents 5 Live's Sunday morning show and is a special correspondent during the week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
