The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Monday that 18 people were known to have been murdered in a handful of tightly knit Nova Scotia communities in the hours-long rampage on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The police warned that the casualty figure was likely to rise as investigations continued. Authorities say Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old denturist, impersonated a police officer during the shooting spree that began in the coastal town of Portapique but quickly spread out over the province, ending at a gas station in the town of Enfield, 58 miles away. Wortman was shot dead by police following a standoff late on Sunday morning. The victims included an elementary school teacher, a police officer and at least three married couples were also killed. The first identified was Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two who had served on the force for 23 years. Stevenson was killed after responding to a shooting on Sunday morning, police said. \u201cWe have lost one of our own while she was protecting others,\u201d said RCMP chief superintendent Chris Leather on Monday afternoon. \u201cThis is the definition of a true hero.\u201d Stevenson previously worked as a school liaison officer. Former colleagues shared a photograph of her crossing the street with a group of smiling children. \u201cShe was answering the call of duty, something she had done every day,\u201d said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. As news of the shootings spread, family and friends remembered the victims over social media. Among the dead was Tom Bagley, who neighbours say was killed as he rushed to help others. \u201cThis beautiful soul was taken from me so unnecessarily. I can\u2019t even comprehend it,\u201d his daughter Charlene wrote on Facebook. Her request that the community share memories of her father was met with hundreds of comments, where Bagley was remembered as a fun-loving and caring friend who never thought twice about lending a hand. Residents told local media that Wortman set fire to numerous properties on Saturday evening \u2013 including his own \u2013 and shot people fleeing for safety. The house of John Zahl and Elizabeth Joanne Thomas, who were neighbours of Wortman, was among those destroyed in a fire. The couple, and their cats, are presumed dead, the family said in an online fundraiser. A family of three, Jolene Oliver, Aaron (Friar) Tuck, and their daughter Emily where also killed in the shooting. Tammy Oliver-McCurdie remembered her sister Jolene as a \u201clover of poetry and books\u201d and full of infectious laughter. \u201cShe was super fun and enjoyed the beauty in life,\u201d wrote Oliver-McCurdie on a crowdfunding page set up to help cover funeral expenses. Oliver-McCurdie said her niece Emily, 17, loved playing the fiddle and fixing vehicles with her father, Aaron. Heather O\u2019Brien, a nurse and grandmother from the town Truro in central Nova Scotia, was remembered for her kind and generous spirit. \u201cThe pain comes and goes in waves. I feel like I\u2019m outside of my own body,\u201d wrote her daughter, Darcy Dobson, who described texting her mother minutes before she died. \u201cI want everyone to remember how kind she was \u2026 Let those things define her. Not the horrible way she died.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s niece, Megan Brown, remembered her aunt, who worked as a nurse for 17 years, as a \u201chealer\u201d and a \u201cbright light\u201d. Greg and Jamie Blair, a husband and wife, were also among those killed. \u201cI have absolutely no words for the heartache my family &amp; many others are going through,\u201d wrote Jessica MacBurnie on Facebook. The couple, married in 2014, leave behind their two children. Lisa McCully, a teacher and mother of two, was also killed during the rampage, according to her sister and the Nova Scotia Teachers Union. \u201cShe was somebody who taught from the heart,\u201d said the union president, Paul Wozney. \u201cShe taught her kids not just the curriculum but teaching about virtues and personal qualities.\u201d Sean McLeod and Alanna Jenkins, who both worked as corrections officers, were also killed. With Nova Scotia already in lockdown in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Trudeau acknowledged the grieving process would be especially difficult, announcing a virtual Facebook vigil on Friday at 7pm. \u201cTo the grandparent who lost a child, the children who lost a parent to the neighbour who lost a friend: we are so sorry for your loss,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a tragedy should have never occurred.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
