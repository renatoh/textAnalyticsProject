The Manchester United forward has had a difficult year, struggling with injuries and unable to find form for his club. \u201cFor six weeks I felt worse than I ever have before,\u201d said the 30-year-old, who injured an ankle late in the season, after the game. \u201cI struggled in the first 45 minutes, I felt tired, but I improved in the second half.\u201d Eduardo Vargas scored twice to become Chile\u2019s all-time leading scorer in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, and Erick Pulgar also found the net. Chile are trying to become the first nation to win three straight Copa titles since Argentina in the late 1940s. The victory moved Chile to the top of Group C alongside Uruguay, who opened with a 4-0 win over Ecuador on Sunday. \u201cChile has players who are very experienced, who know each other very well,\u201d the Chile coach, Reinaldo Rueda, said. \u201cThe challenge today was to avoid a bad first game. We were humble and entered with our feet on the ground. We were playing against a team that was very competitive in all areas of the pitch.\u201d Japan, playing as a Copa Am\u00e9rica guest for the second time, have a young squad at the tournament as they build towards a home Olympics next year. Their youngsters struggled against an experienced Chile team who were in control from the start at the Morumbi Stadium in S\u00e3o Paulo. Rueda, taking charge of Chile in an official tournament for the first time, has been gradually revamping the squad since he assumed the role in 2018. Among the veterans back from the team\u2019s recent triumphs were Vargas, S\u00e1nchez and Arturo Vidal, who also had a good opener. Japan last featured in the Copa America in 1999, when they were eliminated in the group stage. Among the youngsters playing for them in Brazil is Takefusa Kubo, the 18-year-old who has joined Real Madrid for next season. Qatar, hosts of the 2022 World Cup, are the other guest nation in this year\u2019s tournament. They drew 2-2 with Paraguay in their Group B opener on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
