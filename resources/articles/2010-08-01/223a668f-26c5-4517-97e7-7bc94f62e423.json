One basic strand runs through the Con-Dems' policy. It is the swift repudiation of the postwar social settlement and an unrelenting march back to the 1930s, enthusiastically led by Captain Cameron with Corporal Clegg nonchalantly bringing up the rear. The promised cuts in public services are on a scale of which Stanley Baldwin would have been proud. They will reduce the public sector to much what it was in his time \u2013 crude basic provision for the worst off. The changes to health services mean the wholesale dismantling of Bevan's 1948 comprehensive, equitable and publicly accountable NHS. In the 1940s the Conservatives tried to oppose the creation of the NHS; now they have succeeded. It will be replaced by an atomised system of private commissioning, through GPs and the private firms brought in to support them; and delivery through hospitals that are no longer publicly owned. NHS privatisation is not just in prospect. It is here now. Likewise the introduction of free schools and academies, entailing as they do the effective abolition of LEAs and any semblance of fair admissions policies, are a huge rebuttal of Butler's 1945 Education Act with its even distribution of power between government and localities. It will be replaced by a centralised system. The proposed cuts in social security benefits will undermine the \"cradle to the grave\" philosophy so eloquently expounded in the 1940s by Beveridge and built into postwar legislation. It is understandable that Conservatives enthusiastically favour such changes. Quite why the Lib Dems are involved remains a mystery. Robin Wendt Chester \u2022\u2008Your leader continues to make the erroneous argument that the government is reducing public spending \"too much and too fast\". That debate is over. A more productive contribution would be a consideration of the role of the state. It is important that the government, rather than focusing on achieving 25% reductions across departmental budgets, takes a hard look at what the state should and should not be doing. There is then a strong chance that the UK can have a leaner but fitter state that delivers top-class public services, while creating more opportunity for the private sector to create jobs. Only with this approach will we embed the private sector recovery and ensure that a more efficient state emerges from the spending squeeze. Miles Templeman Director general, Institute of Directors \u2022\u2008Does Tony Blair's aphorism about prime ministers being most popular when least effective at the beginning of their term of office, and most effective when least popular at the end, bear scrutiny? Think of postwar premiers after ageing, sickness and events have taken their toll: Wilson, Eden, Macmillan and, above all, Churchill. Is he thinking only of himself? If so, many would challenge that as an example of his argument. John Bailey St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022\u2008I am writing to offer your headline writer a short internship at my company in order to gain experience in written reporting based on data analysis. A survey showing that 44% of the adult population feel that the coalition was doing a good job in securing economic recovery \u2013 and that 37% believe it is doing a bad job \u2013 should not result in the headline \"Public backs coalition on economy\" (18 August). Junior executives at my company soon learn how to interpret data and use appropriate descriptive terms such as a \"roughly even split\" or \"marginally more in favour than oppose\", which I think would have given a very different slant to your front page. Paul Baker Managing director, Vector Research \u2022\u2008I note the current approval for the government's plans. When 8.5 million current occupational pensioners realise that the move to CPI index-linking will rob each of them of an average of \u00a38,000, I suspect that the ratings will fall rapidly. For the further 18 million with occupational pensions yet to come, the penny might take longer to drop. But the coalition should be aware that pensioners have a long collective memory.
