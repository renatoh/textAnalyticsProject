In a move that caught the markets by surprise, Goldman brought forward a scheduled earnings announcement to reveal a 13% surge in quarterly profits to $1.66bn, proving itself to be in a healthier financial condition than many rivals. Through a multibillion-dollar public offering of stock, Goldman hopes to replenish its coffers sufficiently to return $10bn of money from the US treasury's troubled asset relief programme (Tarp). Along with JP Morgan and Bank of America, Goldman has made no secret of its desire to be rid of the strings attached to the government funds. These include restrictions on executive compensation, limits to dividend payouts and unprecedented scrutiny from politicians. Goldman executives have complained privately that business under such conditions is becoming \"impossible\". Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said the bank's financial results, which included a 39% rise in trading and investment revenue to $7.15bn, were strong in a climate of frozen credit markets. \"Given the difficult market conditions, we are pleased with this quarter's performance,\" he said. Returning the government's bailout money is contingent on Goldman passing a \"stress test\" levied on all major banks by the Obama administration to check their long-term viability. A Goldman spokesman said the treasury funds were \"never intended as permanent capital\" and the public wanted the money repaid. \"It is entirely appropriate that firms that can repay the money should repay it.\" Banks have become increasingly nervous about a perceived rise in anti-Wall Street rhetoric since controversy arose last month about bonus payouts at the troubled insurer AIG. President Obama has repeatedly warned that a \"cultural shift\" needs to take place and the financial services industry needs to make sacrifices. Only a handful of regional banks have repaid bailout funds, including Signature Bank of New York, Old National Bancorp of Indiana and Iberiabank of Louisiana. During a meeting with Obama at the end of March, Blankfein and fellow Wall Street bosses asked for detailed guidance on how they could repay Tarp funds rapidly. There may be nervousness within the treasury about allowing Goldman off the hook, for fear that banks unable to repay money will be stigmatised and weakened further. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York, told Bloomberg News: \"The right thing for government officials to do would be to delay the Goldman Sachs repayment until a significant group of banks are able to repay simultaneously under some organised plan.\" During unofficial after-hours trading, Goldman's stock slipped 1.8% to $127.82 in anticipation of shares being diluted by the fundraising. The Dow Jones industrial average had ended the day down 25 points to 8,057 depressed, in part, by reports that carmaker General Motors has is being pressed by the government to prepare for a bankruptcy filing by 1 June. Goldman's better than expected earnings included a doubling in net revenue from fixed-income trading to $6.56bn. Revenue from equities dropped by 20% to $2bn as global stockmarkets fell steeply and the bank's principal investments division suffered a loss of $1.41bn. Several rival banks are due to report financial results later in the week and analysts will be watching closely for signs that the worst may be over in terms of the multibillion-dollar losses suffered by Wall Street over the last 18 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
