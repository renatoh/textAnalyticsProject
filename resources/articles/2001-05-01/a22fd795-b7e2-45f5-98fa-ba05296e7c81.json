The relegated midlands club will hope to bank about \u00a35m for the 29-year-old Moroccan international, after making it clear that their relegation to the First Division will precipitate widespread changes at Highfield Road. \"I have had talks with the chairman [Bryan Richardson] and told him of my desire to stay but he told me that I was better than the First Division and that I should find a team in the top division,\" said Hadji. \"Therefore I will certainly be transferred to another club. \"The club made a lot of investments last season and, now they need the money back, I am the only player who can bring in a lot of money.\" Blackburn Rovers expect to launch a busy summer of transfer activity by buying the Turkish midfielder Tugay Kerimoglu from Rangers for \u00a31.5m. \"Talks have been going on with Rangers and there is a likelihood we will move in with a formal offer,\" a Blackburn spokesman said.
