Alistair Grimason's mother and grandmother had been out for a meal in a cafe in the Turkish resort of Foca last July when Daimi Akyuz, 32, began arguing with his fellow diners at a nearby table. He then pulled out a gun and fired. A stray bullet pierced two-year-old Alistair's lungs, killing him instantly. Akyuz admitted killing Alistair, from East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, but denied a charge of murder. Yesterday a judge in Izmir found him guilty of intentionally killing the toddler and of murdering a local mobile phone salesman, Ali Bektas, during the same gunfight. He was sentenced to a total of 58 years in prison - 30 years for murdering Alistair, 21 years for Mr Bektas and seven years for injuring two other men with a firearm. However, under Turkish law the maximum jail term is 36 years. Since Alistair's death, his parents, David and Ozlem, have campaigned in Turkey for an overhaul of the country's gun laws. They were in court yesterday to hear the verdict. Speaking after the 40-minute hearing, Mr Grimason said: \"I think the sentence is fitting and there is a sense of relief that he was given the full amount for murdering my son.\" Mr Grimason, who now lives with his wife in Edinburgh, added: \"I am just glad that this is now over, but nothing can bring our little boy back and our lives have been changed for ever.\" As shots were fired in the cafe, Mrs Grimason, who is originally from Turkey, tried to shield Alistair. When she pulled his pram towards her, however, she spotted blood. Her son was dead. Mr Grimason, who had gone back to Scotland only a week before, immediately returned to Turkey. Yesterday Mrs Grimason welcomed the sentence, but said she could not feel happy. \"We are still a bit lost. Our plans for the future involved the three of us, but Alistair is gone. I miss him dearly. People say time is a healer but I don't know. \"I will never be able to find forgiveness in my heart for the man who robbed us of our son,\" she said. Akyuz was arrested last September after he was discovered hiding out in a local house. He initially stood trial in December on a charge of accidentally murdering Alistair, which would have carried a maximum sentence of five years. In his defence, Akyuz said he had been in the cafe in Foca with several other people when he drew his gun with the intention of shooting a man who had insulted him. He claimed that his hand was grabbed and the bullets went astray, killing Alistair. Akyuz admitted firing the gun, but he said Alistair's death was an accident. At the third trial hearing in April, however, the court in Izmir changed the charge of unintentional killing to murder, after forensic evidence showed none of the men in the cafe on the night of Alistair's murder could have grabbed Akyuz's hand. The prosecution was led by Alistair's grandfather, Tuncer Essizhan, a Turkish lawyer. He said: \"This is a good day for our fight against individuals with guns but we still feel much pain every day.\" In their campaign to have Turkey's gun laws changed, Alistair's parents gathered more than 200,000 signatures for a petition they submitted to the Turkish parliament. The main street in Foca has been renamed in Alistair's honour. Alistair's parents have travelled to Turkey for all the trial hearings. Mr Grimason, who works as a printer, said yesterday that the court case and the year since Alistair's death had been almost impossible for the couple to bear. \"It's after a year and I still don't fully understand what happened or why it happened to us,\" he said. \"We went there to see the family on a harmless holiday and look what happened.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
