Powell and her players are heading for Rennes, where on Saturday against the French a point will be good enough to qualify for the 2007 world tournament, to be staged in China. England have failed to reach the finals since 1995, when with Powell in midfield they progressed to the last eight before losing to Germany. Having until then been among the world's leading teams, a period of decline set in and the lowest ebb was reached with a 21-match spell that brought 15 defeats. Since Powell took over in 1998, however, that trend has been reversed to the point where England will head into Saturday's game on the back of the best run - just two defeats in 23 matches - in the 34-year history of the national team. Powell said: \"After the 1995 World Cup the top teams progressed but we didn't. We had the technical ability but not the physical strength or fitness, so when I came into this job I felt we had to change the culture of training and match preparation. We've done that over the last eight years and we are starting to reap some benefits.\" Reaching the World Cup finals would be a major benefit to the women's game in England, and doing so at the expense of France would also be sweet revenge for having gone out to the French at the qualifying stage of the 2003 finals. At sixth in the world, France, with whom England fought out a tense goalless draw in the reverse qualifier at Blackburn in March, are ranked six places higher than Powell's team. But she said: \"We weren't confident four years ago, but we've improved a lot and with our current run of form we have to go into Saturday's match believing we can get the result we want.\" International calls meant that only two Women's Premier League games were played yesterday. Charlton Athletic, whose England striker Eniola Aluko hit a 13-minute hat-trick, won 7-2 at Fulham while Bristol Academy won 5-4 at Blackburn Rovers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
