On Wednesday Christian Porter told Radio National the proposed Religious Discrimination Act will \u201cfollow the basic architecture of discrimination bills\u201d by defining religion as a protected attribute. The comments appear to rule out demands for a broader bill to give a positive right to express religious opinions even where they breach employment codes of conduct, as occurred when rugby player Israel Folau claimed on social media that gay people go to hell. Coalition members who have publicly pushed for that option include Kevin Andrews, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and Barnaby Joyce. But conservative Coalition members have not given up on agitating the issue, citing swings against Labor in some areas with high religious populations as indicating a mood for greater protections. Porter said the Coalition\u2019s plan is to release an \u201comnibus bill which tidies up a range of issues such as clarifying whether or not in the Charities Act you could be excluded from being a charity for proposing the traditional definition of marriage\u201d. He described the bill as \u201clargely uncontroversial\u201d, despite the fact in December it was described as a bill to provide \u201cequal status\u201d to freedom of religion alongside the right to non-discrimination, which will likely be controversial to LGBTI groups. The government has also referred the issue of religious schools\u2019 exemptions \u2013 which allow discrimination against LGBT students and staff \u2013 to the Australian Law Reform Commission. Porter said that when parliament resumes in early July or shortly after the government will present a religious discrimination bill that will follow the \u201cvery standard architecture of discrimination acts\u201d. \u201cWe define an attribute, in this case someone\u2019s religious qualities or indeed irreligious qualities \u2013 it will apply to people who don\u2019t believe in religion \u2013 and then we say that persons holding those attributes will be protected from certain behaviour in certain circumstances, again, just like the Race or Sex Discrimination Act. \u201cAnd then the third part of the act will be a range of logical exceptions that you\u2019ll have to have.\u201d Porter said the law would protect people \u201cbecause of the fact that they hold a particular religious view\u201d. On Tuesday Liberal MP Tim Wilson backed the more limited form of a religious discrimination act which he said would not be \u201coverly controversial\u201d but is \u201cquite different from a religious freedom act\u201d. \u201cAnd the reality is, freedom of religion includes people of faith and without faith because that\u2019s a legitimate exercise for your freedom of conscious as well, so once you start going down that path of religious freedom act, what you are actually arguing for is a human rights act,\u201d he told the ABC. Wilson said that such a law would \u201cempower bureaucrats and unelected judges to be able to make decisions about the limits of our freedom rather than the parliament and peoples\u2019 natural right to be able to live their life freely\u201d. LGBT rights groups agree in theory that discrimination on the basis of religion should be outlawed but have warned that the law must be a \u201cshield not a sword\u201d against LGBTI people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
