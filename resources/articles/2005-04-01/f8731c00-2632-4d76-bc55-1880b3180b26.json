To be sure, everything at Aintree will, inevitably, forever be a paler shade of Red Rum - and understandably so - but the 74-year-old trainer embraces the new with the relish of a man 50 years younger. \"The National just gets better and better.\" A few days ago he watched a video of a Dutch television film made last year when Amberleigh House - \"a grand little horse\" - finally rid McCain of the one-horse trainer tag, not that it was something that ever worried him. \"I just sat and marvelled at the splendour of it all. The wonderful wrought iron work on the stands which were all sparkling white. Goodness knows what it will be like when they spend another \u00a330m on it. But this is the best course in the world, and the best race.\" His love affair with Aintree is second only, his family apart, to that of Red Rum. He loves everything about it, and was sick to the base of his boots when the race appeared to be losing its appeal in the 70s. \"Even when Rummy was first running there was only a parson and his dog there, and people were rattling buckets under your nose to try and raise money. It was sickening situation. The National was dying on its feet.\" And then he's off. \"If this race had been south of the Trent the government would have poured money into it. It was another example of the North-South divide.\" A dig at Ascot, a swipe at Cheltenham, a small rage against the iniquities of betting tax. The old fires are burning as brightly as ever. He laughs. \"I'm settling down now, you know. The fires are better for roasting potatoes on these days.\" But he loves to talk, and that talk can be as free and unfettered as an unsaddled horse, and just as likely to veer off the track. His views on women jockeys hit the headlines recently - when he criticised Carrie Ford who will partner Forest Gunner - and he has little time for women trainers either. Totally blinkered, many would argue. Yet he embraces Ladies' Day, the Friday before the National, with a passion. \"I was at a hospital the other day and one of the nurses was telling me that six of them were going to Aintree. It's brilliant to see all the young people there these days.\" As for Amberleigh House, McCain believes the 13-year-old has achieved that \"fine edge\" that can single out a winner. \"He's very alert, and has that distant look in his eyes. Last year I said you would have had to shoot him to keep him out of the first four. \"This time we are keeping our eye on the weather, but without sounding over-confident or anything I think that if we get a clear run then we'll get a big race. \"It may sound daft, given his age now, but I thought that last year he won with a bit in hand, and I think he can improve a bit more this time.\" Back in his young days McCain, by his own admission, would have regarded it as unbelievable that he would mingle with those in the grandstand: \"I never aspired to that. I was looking to get into the course by the bottom gate.\" Now it would barely be the National without him. And it seems only the swish of a horse's tail since last year. \"Don't let's go down that road. Every year the race seems to come round quicker and quicker. I don't want to even think about it.\" But for all that McCain claims to be appreciably calmer now than when Red Rum was in his pomp. \"I'm much, much more relaxed. I don't get edgy before the race, in fact I was quite switched off last year.\" Only his closest family and friends could vouch for the complete truth of that remark. After Amberleigh House's win, McCain was unstoppable. It was as if a much admired actor, after years of resting, had suddenly re-emerged in a West End smash hit. \"Am I talking too much? You must stop me,\" he grinned, his face red and his eyes blazing beneath his bushy white eyebrows. But nobody wanted to do that. Not for a second. And goodness knows when he will stop should the horse win again this Saturday. \"It's a tremendous credit to everybody involved that the National has become what it is now. There's no other race like it in the world - so many brave horses and brave men,\" McCain enthused. \"Even the fences are almost back to what they were after they pandered to the do-gooders\" And he was off again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
