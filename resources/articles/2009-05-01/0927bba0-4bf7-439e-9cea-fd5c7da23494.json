Free Agent, owned by the Queen, could finish only fourth of five runners in the Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood, losing his unbeaten record and getting himself ruled out of Epsom by his trainer. The warning signs had been there for all to see. The colt, who had given Her Majesty a rare winner at Royal Ascot last summer in the Chesham Stakes, had not been seen since, having been sidelined by a series of setbacks including a bruised foot that stopped him running at Chester a fortnight ago. The race, formerly known as the Predominate, developed well for Free Agent, who settled behind Godolphin's Chock A Block before being sent to the front after the turn for home. But he failed to quicken clear of his field and was swept aside by Alwaary, trained by John Gosden for Hamdan Al Maktoum. Free Agent's Epsom prospects, assessed at 33\u20131 by the bookmakers yesterday morning, are now nil. \"There is going to be no Derby for him,\" said his trainer, Richard Hannon. \"We will put him in the King Edward VII Stakes over a mile and a half and the two-mile Queen's Vase.\" Both those races are run at Royal Ascot and Hannon said he was keen to have runners for the Queen at that meeting. But an entry in the Queen's Vase appears to be an admission that Free Agent is sorely lacking in speed. \"He came there to win his race but didn't go through with it and might have needed it a bit,\" the trainer added. \"He has run a good, sound race \u2013 I know he is a decent horse.\" That view was slightly undermined by Gosden, who appeared confident that he has a better Classic candidate than Alwaary at home. \"He is in the Derby but I think that would be unwise, so I would like to say \u2013 if it is OK with the owner \u2013 that he has run a fabulous prep for the King Edward VII.\" Gosden was nevertheless delighted with his winner, who had been fourth in the Lingfield Derby Trial just 11 days before. \"We went to Lingfield to just get him back on the track and he suddenly blossomed after it. The race got his whole metabolic rate tuned up and we wouldn't normally run back this quick but the owner gave us special permission.\" Debussy will represent Gosden in the big race at Epsom on 6 June. \"Someone has to turn up in the Derby for England,\" he added. There might be no point in anyone turning up at The Curragh for the first two Classics of the Irish season this weekend. By late yesterday, the course had taken 45mm (nearly 2in) of rain in three days and, unless the weather improves, the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas may be abandoned. \"We've been raceable today,\" said a course spokesman, \"but we don't need another day like yesterday, that would leave us in trouble.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
