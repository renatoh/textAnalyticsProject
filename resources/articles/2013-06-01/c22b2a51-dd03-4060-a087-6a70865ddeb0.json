When the Arctic Monkeys first headlined Glastonbury in 2007, they were at the peak of a dizzying rise that they themselves could barely comprehend \u2013 the fastest-selling debut album ever, universal critical adoration, a fanbase multiplying like ebola in a dodgy fajita. As Glastonbury virgins, they treated the world's biggest festival with the same nonchalant naivety with which they'd conducted their entire career, and with the added issues of an enormous crowd and 2007's ultra-sensitive perimeter sound limiters, it made for a distant and underwhelming experience. It was virtually impossible to get close enough to hear the band, and Dizzee Rascal's practically unamplified guest spot looked like a bizarre, mumbling stage invasion. Six years later, the Monkeys are a changed band. Now resident in LA and beefed up by working with Queen of the Stone Age's Josh Homme in his desert studio, they're a more powerful and accomplished act with a greater understanding of Glastonbury's stature. Alex Turner has already set about ingratiating himself with the 2013 festival by guesting with his erstwhile partner in the Last Shadow Puppets, Miles Kane, earlier this afternoon, but as he takes to the Pyramid Stage for the Monkeys' headline slot, piling straight into the bluesy electronic throbs of new single Do I Wanna Know in a sharp striped suit and teddy quiff and throwing the odd karate beckoning motion, there's a real sense of points to be proved. The conditions are little more favourable than 2007 \u2013 the crowd is just as monumental and the big screens largely inadequate, showing either grainy, monochrome boxes on each of the band or nothing at all \u2013 but the band is fired up and bolstered with intent. \"Are you in a party mood, everybody?\" Turner asks, and later steals an old Springsteen line: \"We're gonna play all night long,\" he promises in the style of a straw-chewing 50s crooner, \"some Glastonbury specials.\" The first part is always optimistic, but about that second part he's not lying; a hypercharged Teddy Picker, from their second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, merges seamlessly into the sultry carnival slink of Crying Lightning, with its dark and demonic mood swings, an example of how the band have matured into a sordid Lynchian lounge band with teeth. They've embraced the current trend for pre-Beatles rock'n'roll wholeheartedly, Turner even introducing the band ahead of the moody Brick by Brick, sung by drummer Matt Helders, like the cockiest of Johnny's Moondogs. It's the older Monkeys classics, though, that turn back time to re-create the celebration that their 2007 set should have been. An early one-two of Brianstorm and Dancing Shoes sets the pace at breakneck and a lean, mean Fake Tales of San Francisco, an early rarity full of hookers and drug casualties, sends the crowd into paroxysms, as does a haunting orchestral version of Mardy Bum. The ghost of 2007 is laid to rest, Glastonbury is fittingly honoured, and the Monkeys finally earn their Glastonbury stripes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
