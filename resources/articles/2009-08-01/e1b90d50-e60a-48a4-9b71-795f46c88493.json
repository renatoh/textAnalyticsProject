But that seems precisely the strategy of Fila, official shoe supplier to the Wimbledon tennis championships. Advertising hoardings at England's friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday night carried the legend: \"Fila: Icon Of The Casuals\". This is part of a wider marketing campaign and, with a plug on its official website for a remake of the 1988 football-hooligan movie, The Firm, Fila is clearly aware of the football-violence connotations of the word, and explains how \"rival gangs, known as firms, and their members described as 'casuals', wore brightly coloured sportswear\". The FA pointed out that the advertising hoardings at Wednesday's match had been sold by its Dutch counterpart through a third-party agency. But a spokesman added: \"We have a very strong stance on hooliganism; we are held as a standard bearer across the world.\" The campaign by Fila, which did not return calls, does not seem to sit well with the demure reputation of Wimbledon. But organisers at the All England Club would only comment on its \"tennis relationship\" with Fila, which it described as \"very good\". Leeds ownership mystery When Ken Bates told a court in June that he did not know who are the investors behind the Forward Sports Fund, owners of Leeds United, it seemed a strange comment. Bates is chairman of Leeds and given that a shareholders' register was being kept at the London premises of his lawyer and Leeds co-director, Mark Taylor, how could he not know its contents? A month later that same register was transferred to Elland Road by the club's chief executive, Sean Harvey. Moreover the Football League requires that individuals who are the ultimate controlling parties of its clubs be declared so it may apply its fit-and-proper-persons test. \"He knows the names of the corporate entities that own the club,\" explained Harvey, when Digger asked about the discrepancy this week. But the Football League \u2013 which in order to work through its fit-and-proper procedures has so far refused to ratify the takeover of Notts County by Munto, also an offshore nominee company \u2013 needs to know names. \"The Football League has been supplied by Leeds United with whatever information it sought.\" So does Bates know? Harvey said he would get back to Digger with a more considered explanation. But despite several follow-up calls, he did not. Mosley's name in frame There is talk in the Formula One paddock that Jean Todt will install none other than Max Mosley as his inaugural F1 commissioner if he becomes president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile. With Todt creating new roles, there are concerns among teams that Mosley, against whom they revolted, could return to a position of power. Todt's campaign manager, Richard Woods, said: \"It is far too early to talk about individuals in specific roles.\" Although Mosley has suggested he has no desire for a return to the frontline, it will be interesting to see how teams react if Todt grants his ambition to become the sport's policy manager in charge of safety and environmental issues. Ramps keeping calm For one who once ripped off his shirt and charged across the Rose Bowl to stare out a section of Hampshire fans, whose team he had just defeated with a run out, Mark Ramprakash has become remarkably placid in his old age. To the extent that although the captain who ended his Test career, Nasser Hussain, and his old mate Mark Butcher both publicly dismissed his usefulness to England, old Bloodaxe has not even mentioned it. \"People ask their opinions, whatever they say I respect it,\" Ramprakash told Digger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
