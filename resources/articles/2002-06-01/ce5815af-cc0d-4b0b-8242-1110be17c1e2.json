The striker suffered a groin injury against the Republic of Ireland and has not trained with his team-mates since. \"If he says he's 100% and the doctor says he's 100%, he will play,\" Spain's coach Jose Antonio Camacho said. \"If not, he won't, like the rest. You have to take into account that it's not just one game we hope to play. \"What we need is to control the game from the start because a game can be won in the first minute or the 90th, as we have seen. So we need a player who is match fit.\" Raul is so crucial to Spain that he is always picked by Camacho when fit. He started all eight qualifiers and played in every match at Euro 2000. If he fails to recover fully, Juan Carlos Valeron could be moved from midfield to play behind Fernando Morientes. But Camacho will not hesitate to throw on Raul as a substitute if Spain are in need of a goal to stay in the competition. That is hardly inconceivable given Korea's success over the past 2 weeks. \"Korea have everything in their favour to be the champions,\" Camacho said. \"They have the advantage of an incomparable public support, they've beaten Portugal and Italy and they never lower their guard. They're a difficult side to beat, they run a lot and have quality.\" Spain must play in the heat and humidity of the afternoon for the first time but Camacho will insist his players run hard and fight for every ball. Today the squad will train in the heat to help them acclimatise. \"The game will be very intense, with a high tempo,\" Camacho said. \"We have to stand up to them and play our football because, if not, they will eat us up. \"The Italians gave away too many balls around the penalty area and Korea were able to take advantage. We have to hold on to the ball. The chances that Korea get they use. Italy did not give them many chances but those that they did were exploited.\" Spain have never won a World Cup quarter-final, losing at that stage in 1934, 1986 and 1994. Gaizka Mendieta, who is wanted by Barcelona after a miserable season at Lazio, said Korea would be aided by their coach Guus Hiddink's knowledge of the Spanish players. \"There's no doubt it will be a help,\" he said. \"When I got to Valencia he was the coach. He's shown here in Korea that he can adapt to any conditions.\" It has not gone unnoticed in the Spanish camp that Italy and Portugal both had players sent off against Korea. Camacho, though, played down suggestions that officials were favouring the co-hosts. \"It doesn't worry me,\" he said. Of more concern is the fitness of the man who can make his team tick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
