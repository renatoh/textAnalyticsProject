It was Wednesday's sixth defeat in 12 matches and left them fourth-bottom of the Championship, although Sturrock was given a new four-year deal only last month. The former Hillsborough players Nigel Worthington, Gary Megson and Nigel Pearson have already been linked with the vacancy, along with the recently fired Leeds manager Kevin Blackwell. \"Our league position says it all,\" the chairman Dave Allen said. \"In spite of strengthening the squad we have not made the desired progress and to that end, we need a change in the coaching staff.\" Sturrock, with Wednesday since September 2004 after being fired by Southampton two games into that season, took the club to promotion via the play-offs in his first season, finished 19th last time and was brutally honest after this week's Colchester defeat which left them a point off the bottom. \"There can be no excuses,\" he said. \"The players should be apologising for that. People have been pointing the finger at injuries and suspensions but it has come to the point where we have to bring in the players who have the heart and commitment to play for my team.\" Sunderland have borrowed Derby's 18-year-old defender Lewin Nyatanga until January. The Welshman played 25 games last season but has managed only six this season, despite playing for his country against Slovakia and Cyprus. Two former Boston United officials have been cleared of taking part in a \u00a3323,000 tax swindle to \"prop up\" the ailing club. They were accused of disguising wages and bonuses as expenses with the help of two self-confessed conspirators, the manager Steve Evans and former chairman Patrick Malkinson. Peterborough have had a \u00a31m bid for the MK Dons striker Izale McLeod turned down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
