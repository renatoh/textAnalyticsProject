Neville said history had taught him to expect a drop-off from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side this season, and predicted it could lead to Manchester City pipping them to the title next May. \u201cTo get to a Champions League final, win it the following season, and then to go again to win the Premier League title is a huge emotional drain on that group of Liverpool players for three years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo ask them to go again and achieve that same standard would be a superhuman effort. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be ridiculous to suggest there will be a slight drop-off, if they don\u2019t somehow stimulate that squad by doing something to give them that lift again. Thiago would be the big one. He is world class and would give them a world-class presence in an area of the field where they don\u2019t have one.\u201d Thiago\u2019s contract with Bayern runs out next summer, and while Liverpool have been linked with the Spain international they are yet to make a bid. But Neville warned: \u201cLiverpool are not perfect. They have a world-class goalkeeper, centre-back and strikers. They have really good midfield players with good work ethic but with Thiago would be another step. He would control the game with that weight of pass, that nous.\u201d Neville also expressed his disappointment in Manchester United\u2019s board for not doing more to back Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in the transfer market this summer \u2013 and said he was also concerned that the battle for the No 1 spot between David de Gea and Dean Henderson could prove an unwelcome subplot. \u201cIt\u2019s never an ideal situation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always better having an excellent No 1 and a quite clear, very good No 2. Henderson isn\u2019t going to sit around and wait. And every time De Gea makes some mistake we\u2019ll be asking: is this Henderson\u2019s moment? \u201cCertainly when we had a changing goalkeeping situation, say between Roy Carroll and Tim Howard, it was unhealthy as none of them really knew who the No 1 was. None of them probably felt fully supported \u2013 and they always probably felt like they were one mistake away from the other one playing. That could happen with De Gea and Henderson. It\u2019s going to be a real challenge of Ole\u2019s management skills to keep them both happy, because I think that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Neville also urged United\u2019s board to move quickly to bring in new players to help Solskj\u00e6r get closer to Liverpool and City. \u201cA trophy and breaking that top two has to be the next step. But that\u2019s going to be difficult. Ole needs more players and support from the board to do that. \u201cWhen you look at the bench, the game changers aren\u2019t there, the depth is not there. They definitely need a centre-back, a midfield player, a forward and a right winger, and potentially another defender, maybe a left-back too. I am disappointed because I wanted the players that Chelsea signed to go to United.\u201d Neville said that while he expected City to win the Premier League he remained concerned with their defensive failings. \u201cLast season, with Vincent Kompany leaving and Aymeric Laporte getting injured, the reaction in transition to losing the ball was nowhere near as good as it had been in the previous two seasons, but I think Pep Guardiola will want to bounce back.\u201d The Sky Sports pundit also predicted Leeds would provide \u201cthe most fascinating story\u201d of the season. \u201cWhen people say football was better 20 years ago, absolutely not. Promoted teams were rigid but nowadays we\u2019re seeing managers come up with philosophies. Marcelo Bielsa is front foot. They are going to Anfield on the first day, and while they might get a bloody nose they\u2019ll get one fighting the way he wants to fight.\u201d Sky Sports is the home of the Premier League with more live matches than any other broadcaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
