They crashed 2-1 at Stoke, a result which casts serious aspersions on their ability to win the title, had Robin van Persie sent off and Theo Walcott stretchered off, ending the game with nine men. Predictably, it was the long throw of Rory Delap which did for the Gunners, his flings into the box setting up Ricardo Fuller in the 11th minute and Olofinjana in the 73rd. Van Persie received his marching orders two minutes after Olofinjana's effort for a frustrated - and ludicrous - late barge on Steve Sorensen. He will miss next week's match at home to Manchester United. In the final minutes, Walcott landed awkwardly on his arm and was carried off in severe pain. Gael Clichy pulled a late goal back with a deflected strike, but it was not enough to salvage a point from a disastrous day in the Potteries for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side. Manchester United, meanwhile, beat Hull City at Old Trafford as expected, but made a meal of doing so. They were coasting at 4-1 with 21 minutes to go thanks to two goals from Crisitiano Ronaldo and one apiece from Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic, but the visitors pulled one back through Bernard Mendy, then scored another, Geovanni converting from the penalty spot with ten minutes to play, to give United a scare. Despite a nervous few minutes, which saw United give the ball away with uncharacteristic regularity, the champions held on to move into third place. Chelsea ran out easy 5-0 winners at home to Sunderland, Nicolas Anelka scoring a hat-trick, with further goals from Alex and Frank Lampard. Roy Keane was sent to the stands, after complaining about Chelsea's first two goals, both of which appeared to have a hint of offside about them. The result puts Chelsea back at the top of the table - at least for two hours until Liverpool finish playing Spurs in the evening match. There was late drama at Fratton Park, where Wigan's Emile Heskey scored in the final minute to defeat Tony Adams' Portsmouth 2-1. Zaki had given the visitors the lead on the stroke of half time with a penalty, and though it looked like Nico Kranjcar had rescued a point for the home side, equalising with eight minutes to go, Heskey made sure of the win for Wigan. On a busy day, even the two draws offered drama. Mido scored late to salvage a point for Middlesbrough, who had been trailing West Ham to a Hayden Mullins goal, while Andrews scored in the final minute for Blackburn to secure a 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion. Rovers opened the scoring through Benni McCarthy penalty, only to see the scorer sent off for two first-half bookings. Bednar and Ishmael Miller turned the match around, only for Rovers to have the last word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
