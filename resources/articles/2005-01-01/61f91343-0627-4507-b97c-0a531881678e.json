The court martial of three British soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi detainees at an aid base in southern Iraq in May 2003 heard that Sergeant Thomas Simon had broken up the alleged abuse. He intervened after finding two naked male prisoners surrounded by laughing soldiers. He said he felt revulsion and shock at the scene and immediately told the captured men to put their clothes back on. Sgt Simon's evidence was heard at the court martial in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, where three soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers are accused of abusing and assaulting prisoners at Camp Breadbasket, in Basra. Corporal Daniel Kenyon, 33, Lance Corporal Mark Cooley, 25, both from Newcastle upon Tyne, and Lance Corporal Darren Larkin, 30, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, are all facing court martial. Cpl Kenyon and L/Cpl Cooley deny all the charges. L/Cpl Larkin admits one charge of assaulting an unknown male but denies forcing two Iraqi males to undress in front of others. Photographs released from the hearing show disturbing images of Iraqi detainees being forced to simulate sexual acts and being apparently beaten. One picture shows a bound detainee hanging from the tines of a forklift truck. Sgt Simon, who was a corporal at the time of the alleged offences, told the court today he saw L/Cpl Larkin laughing at the naked men. The sergeant told the hearing, which is being held at a military court at the men's base in Germany: \"He was just stood there. Before I got there I could hear him laughing or what I assumed to be laughing. As I got closer, the laughing increased.\" After realising what was happening, he went over to the Iraqis and gestured to them to put their clothes on. Sgt Simon, who was mentioned in dispatches for taking out an enemy anti-aircraft gun, said: \"Now that I have had time to think about it, seeing what I did see, the two naked Iraqis, I believe now, to my disgust, I should have said something to someone higher up in authority, above me. But due to the state of my subconscious, I didn't.\" He said: \"Due to the shock of me actually seeing this, everything else was blocked out.\" The hearing has heard that the Iraqis had been captured as suspected looters, and that the soldiers had been told by a superior to \"work them hard\" by forcing them to pick up rubbish. Sgt Simon told the court he was not happy about the order. He said: \"In my own mind, I probably believed it was wrong but who was I at the time? I was just doing what I was told.\" Evidence of the alleged abuse came to light after Fusilier Gary Bartlam, 20, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, took photographs of the incidents to be developed at his local photo shop. Staff at the shop contacted the police and Bartlam was arrested. Bartlam was found guilty at a court martial earlier this month related to the abuse case; a judge imposed reporting restrictions on the details of his case. The court was adjourned until Monday afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
