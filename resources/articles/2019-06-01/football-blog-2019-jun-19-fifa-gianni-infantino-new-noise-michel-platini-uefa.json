We can say that we\u2019ve turned the situation around. This organisation has gone from being toxic, almost criminal, to being what it should be \u2013 an organisation that develops football and is now synonymous with transparency, integrity.\u201d Mmm. Following the detention of the former Uefa boss Michel Platini on Tuesday, this now joins the ever-lengthening list of things Infantino is wrong about. Or does it? Platini is in some way the most disheartening of all the Fifa round-ups. We had so long come to expect certain behaviours of professional leeches such as Jack Warner, whose only true talent brought joy to no one but their bank managers. That the corruption machine could be even alleged to have devoured perhaps France\u2019s greatest player is a much more tragic state of affairs. Platini has been released without charge and denies all accusations. As he put it: \u201cI feel totally foreign to any of these matters.\u201d Even so, it must be said the story of Platini\u2019s detention and 15-hour questioning didn\u2019t make the crack it would have back in the day. The spring of 2015 feels rather longer ago than it might. Four years back, a Fifa conference in Zurich was enlivened by the arrest of many senior figures from world football\u2019s governing body. Just after 6am, one late May morning, they were led from the Baur au Lac hotel under bedsheets in a raid on behalf of the US authorities. The coverage was wall-to-wall. \u201cThey were expected to uphold the rules that keep soccer honest. Instead they corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves,\u201d declaimed the US attorney general Loretta Lynch at a New York press conference. \u201cThey did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.\u201d Separately, Swiss federal prosecutors announced criminal proceedings in connection with the award of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. Much of the information on which the US was basing its case had been obtained via its plea-bargaining informant Chuck Blazer, the Fifa ExCo member and Concacaf general secretary who rode between vast expense-account dinners on one of his fleet of mobility scooters, ran up a $29m Amex bill and owned a second apartment in his building which was solely for the use of his cats. The building, incidentally, was Trump Tower in New York, which was owned by the man described at the time as \u201cApprentice star and real estate mogul Donald Trump\u201d. Yes, rather a lot has changed in rather a lot of places since the Fifa spring of 2015, and in many ways this political turmoil \u2013 by no means limited to the US \u2013 has been to Fifa\u2019s benefit. Whatever Infantino might claim, it is hard to escape the sense that world football\u2019s governing body has not got cleaner in any meaningful way. It\u2019s just that everything else has got significantly dirtier. It\u2019s hard not to be thrown into sympathetic relief by the Trump presidency, or the Brexit chaos, or the rise of elected autocracy, or mounting evidence of attempts to influence elections by foreign state actors, or any number of other still-raging news bin fires. A few greedy men being led out of a hotel under their own dirty linen now feels something of a period piece. Back then, many significant figures were outraged at what they claimed to see in the initial Fifa indictments and allegations. But read retrospectively, Vladimir Putin\u2019s statement on Sepp Blatter\u2019s departure is not short on dramatic irony. \u201cIt\u2019s another clear attempt by the USA to spread its jurisdiction to other states,\u201d declared the Russian president. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa \u2026 And we know about the pressure put on him to prevent the 2018 World Cup from taking place in Russia.\u201d Indeed, we know more now, with the process by which Qatar won the 2022 tournament (for which Platini voted) being a key line of inquiry for the French investigators. And yet, even the type of elections in which the Russian president was then alleged to be meddling now seem rather quaint given what came after. Putin was said to have offered Platini a Picasso in exchange \u2013 an allegation Platini has always denied. But in a world of pee tapes and poisonings and cybersecurity attacks, none of this feels quite the full-spectrum scandal it once was. The World Cup is still happening in Qatar in 2022, and though Infantino has not succeeded in his plan to further ruin the tournament by boosting it to 48 teams, he will get his way on this front for 2026. Meanwhile he was elected unopposed this month, despite being dogged by various financial and patronage-related allegations from the very start of his presidency. He has denied them all, and so far successfully. So perhaps his speech a fortnight ago was right after all. You don\u2019t hear much talk about crisis and corruption at Fifa any more, even if it so often feels as if there may be more to discuss. Other discussions are louder \u2013 and that will be just the way the old gang like it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
