Fatboy Slim on his 'silent' Ibiza film with Julien Temple", "bodyText": "Superstar DJ Fatboy Slim was recently thinking about \u2013 and questioning \u2013 what it is he does. \u201cI\u2019m just a middle-aged man playing a lot of loud squelching noises to young people, waving his arms around in the air. What really is that?\u201d he asked himself. But then it does make them dance and smile, and he, Norman Cook, still enjoys doing it. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I would have chosen to be doing at this age\u201d \u2013 55 \u2013 \u201cbut I\u2019m loving it so much. It\u2019s the best job in the world because I love music, and my love of music involves sharing it with people.\u201d Is it not boring, doing it sober and drug-free, which he has been for a decade now? \u201cI\u2019m a bit like a vampire. I vicariously get my kicks, but instead of suckling the blood of the young, I absorb their sweat. My secret of eternal youth is being around young people having fun. It\u2019s a kind of serotonin-adrenaline-pheromone mix they give off.\u201d And he taps into it? \u201cI think so. I just lose myself. When I\u2019m in that moment, I\u2019m quite intoxicated. I call it euphoric recall: I tap back into my previous misdemeanours, become in that moment with them but without the hangovers and self-loathing.\u201d Is he happier, sober? \u201cIt makes my life way more manageable. It means I can cope as a father.\u201d Cook has two children with Zo\u00eb Ball, from whom he\u2019s now separated. Nelly, who\u2019s nine, is into Little Mix, but has also been to Caf\u00e9 Mambo in Ibiza with her dad and appreciates he has a cool job. Woody, 18, \u201cis too cool to admit my music might be cool. He\u2019s into drum\u2019n\u2019bass.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s discussed alcohol and drugs with them, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. Now, instead of loathing himself, Cook can loathe golf instead. \u201cEvery moment I\u2019m not playing golf is to be cherished.\u201d Does he play? \u201cNo.\u201d Will he ever? \u201cHopefully not.\u201d Golf equals death. When we meet in the breakfast room of a posh London hotel, Cook looks youthful and healthy. He\u2019s wearing a bright short-sleeved shirt, like a man permanently on holiday. Mornings are easier \u2013 and longer \u2013 than they were before, 10 years ago. Now Cook is branching out from DJing and producing, trying to get respectable jobs on the side, like the film Ibiza: The Silent Movie, a collaboration with director Julien Temple. Temple is due to join us for breakfast but he\u2019s stuck in traffic on a diverted bus. The film is a history of the mythical Mediterranean island \u2013 not just the past 30 years, Cook\u2019s era, but 2,000 years. Before the ravers there were Phoenicians and Moors, Romans, dada poets, beatniks, draft dodgers, fascists. It wasn\u2019t always all smiley faces and euphoria, and if someone had their hands in the air it might have been because they didn\u2019t want to get shot. Twenty-one Ibizan priests weren\u2019t smiling when they were executed during the Spanish civil war; nor Raoul Villain, the French nationalist who died slowly on the beach in 1936; nor this pig being slaughtered and butchered. There is blood in Ibiza\u2019s ochre soil \u2013 though actually probably not from the pig. This is La Matanza, the traditional Spanish way to slaughter a pig, with hardly any waste; everything is chopped up and used. Temple has chopped up the history, mixing ancient legends with modern mythology, the vandalism of Romans with vandalism by 1980s holiday developers, dadaists grooving out to jazz in an old windmill with the ecstasy fuelled masses at Ku, Pasha and Amnesia. It\u2019s witty and playful. There\u2019s a delightful cameo \u2013 Bes the Phoenician God of Dance is played by Bez the Madchester God of Dance (no, really, isn\u2019t that perfect, and he kept his trainers on). It\u2019s hard to categorise. Temple calls it \u201cthe loudest silent movie ever made\u201d \u2013 because it\u2019s only silent in that there\u2019s no speaking. The chopped-up bits are threaded together by a score \u2013 curated, produced and mixed by Fatboy Slim, of course. The soundtrack doesn\u2019t have to dip and fade to allow for the spoken word; this is a film that can be danced to \u2013 as they hope it will be when it opens this week at Cineramageddon, Temple\u2019s giant postapocalyptic drive-in at Glastonbury festival. Cook, a fan of Temple\u2019s since he saw his Sex Pistols film The Great Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Swindle as a teenager, says they have similar methods of working. \u201cThe way he puts a film together is very similar to the way I put a record together \u2013 a kind of collage of found items, juxtaposing things.\u201d For Cook, peak Ibiza was probably around the millennium, the years of Manumission\u2019s super-parties and its live sex shows. \u201cThere were a couple of years that felt like they were the last days of the Roman empire,\u201d he says, not unwistfully. It\u2019s where he met Ball, \u201callegedly saying \u2018How do you fancy not going to bed with me\u201d, he tells me, though the memories from the time are patchy. He does remember her leaping out of his own birthday cake on stage at Manumission. \u201cWe were the Posh\u2019n\u2019Becks of the E generation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would do something and it would end up in the papers. Then more people would just get on the plane [to go there], no hotels booked, just to be a part of it.\u201d He helped fill Temple in on Manumission, Space and DC-10, but Cook had known very little about what had happened on the island earlier. It\u2019s been fascinating discovering \u201cthese recurring themes of people coming to the island to escape \u2013 repression or the draft \u2013 or reinvent themselves, or disappear, bringing with them differing styles of music, alternative lifestyles and fashions. It\u2019s a story of people not invading the island but sort of annexing it.\u201d Ah, here is Temple, hot off the bus, very apologetic, cross about politics. (He wants to set up the Republic of Remainia in Britain: \u201cWe should be Remainian refugees in our own country.\u201d) He shares Cook\u2019s feelings for golf. \u201cI hate golf, I hate what it represents. I\u2019m glad Donald Trump enjoys it,\u201d he says. Ten years older than Cook, and pleasingly lugubrious, he is less Balearic raver, more Glasto man. Long before filming there, he was showing up at Worthy Farm in 1971, with no shoes or money, and saw David Bowie at dawn. Different drugs back then. \u201cMy generation took acid I guess. I did a lot of things I wouldn\u2019t necessarily now,\u201d he says. Presumably, like the men squabbling over who should lead the country, Temple deeply regrets it? \u201cNo, I\u2019m proud. I think my way of making films has something to do with the acid I took. I did start to see things differently as a result of doing that. Young people take drugs to discover what our relationship with the world and reality is, and if there\u2019s a point to it.\u201d Temple wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to make an Ibiza film because clubbing is not really his scene, and because there have been other films. Then he hit upon his silent-movie angle, and the idea of telling the whole story of the island, what makes it a strangely mythic place for generation after generation. And a tragic place, too \u2013 not only because of unfortunate priests and pigs, but because of themagic disappearing under dodgy property developments, the water running out, more and more planes disgorging loutish tourists who in turn disgorge the contents of their stomachs on to the streets of San Antonio. Or the more recent move towards the VIP bottle-service brigade who have money but bring no magic. What was once the poorest place in Europe has become one of the most exclusive. Enlisting Fatboy Slim sealed the deal for Temple. The soundtrack might be different, but the project isn\u2019t much different from his 2006 Glastonbury film, he says. \u201cConnecting the past through music of the past and archive, the collision of things that are not necessarily meant to be together is a very fresh way of entering the past of a place and explaining its relevance to the present.\u201d Cook also has much previous Glastonbury experience (and he\u2019ll be doing a set following the Cineramageddon screening). He thinks Ibiza and Glastonbury aren\u2019t such a long way apart, except perhaps meteorologically. \u201cGlastonbury is a slightly damper, colder version of the same exercise \u2013 escaping to freedom and seeing what happens when you remove the shackles, of having to do a job, get up at any given time, adhere to the norms of society. Then interesting and strange and wonderful things can happen.\u201d Right here, right now, he\u2019s got norms to adhere to, another interview to do, with BBC Radio 6 Music over the road. And Julien Temple has a bus to catch. Ibiza: The Silent Movie is out 5 July and screens at Glastonbury on 26 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
