Ridden by Ryan Moore, the William Haggas-trained colt was one of five British runners and when push came to shove Moore was seen at his power-driving best as he urged King's Apostle through a gap close home to collar Lesson In Humility, the long-time leader, while holding off the late challenge of the unfancied outsider Mariol. A dry few days in northern France had ensured a sound surface at Deauville and when the gates flew open for this top-class contest, the field split into separate groups with King's Apostle racing in the middle of the course along with Mariol and Alan Jarvis's Lesson In Humility. This was clearly the best place to be and the horses obliged to race towards the stands side seemed at a disadvantage, with the well-backed market leader Naaqoos and the strongly fancied African Rose well beaten and unable to land a blow against their better-drawn opponents. King's Apostle, meanwhile, was always tanking along in the middle of the course and once the tempo increased towards the final furlong and a half the five-year-old was seen at his best as he appeared to relish tackling the specialist six-and-a-half furlong trip. Having seemed unfortunate not to finish a place or two closer last time in a rough running of the July Cup, King's Apostle enjoyed a much smoother passage under Ryan Moore, who delivered his mount with a sweetly timed challenge for a first Group One victory. \"He quickened up very nicely when the gap came, it's marvellous,\" said a jubilant Haggas. \"He ran a great race at York first time out this season and then, unfortunately, they had over-watered at Ascot for the Golden Jubilee. Last time out in the July Cup he got knocked sideways and while he might not have won, he probably would have been placed.\" The victory was all the sweeter for connections after King's Apostle had climbed his way up the sprinting ladder, starting off as a smart and progressive handicapper before graduating through to pattern events towards the second half of last season. Things had not really gone his way so far this time around but in France events conspired to give King's Apostle the rub of the green. \"It was slightly strange seeing all those drawn on the rail so far behind,\" Haggas explained, \"but you need luck in life and I think we got ours today. It was also Ryan's first time on him. He was available and as he'd ridden lots in France it seemed sensible to use him, with Johnny Murtagh riding in Ireland.\" Having just scrambled home in a blanket finish featuring five horses, King's Apostle might not find it as easy to land another Group One event, and the proximity of the surprise runner-up Mariol, who was only 10th of 16 in last year's stronger renewal, casts doubts upon the merit of the form. Still, the Newmarket-based Haggas was not complaining: \"He's been knocking on the door in the Group Ones and I think that was thoroughly deserved. We're a bit restricted now as to where we can go so it will be off to Haydock for the Sprint Cup, almost certainly.\" King's Apostle is bound to bump into classier rivals at the Lancashire course and may even end up taking on his sharply progressive stable companion High Standing, who has been rising swiftly through the sprinting ranks and has been touted as a possible runner in the Sprint Cup providing he performs well in the Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh next Sunday. Of other British runners, Lesson In Humility stuck on well and was only headed inside the final furlong, while Sayif ran a huge race as the outsider of the field to finish a close-up fifth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
