On Thursday hundreds of shoppers were trapped in shopping centres in both Sheffield and Rotherham. Many homes have been forced to evacuate and 116 flood warnings remain in place, the majority of them in Yorkshire. The Met Office predicts flooding rains will clear, moving south-east by lunchtime. But, as the clean-up operation begins, flood warnings are expected to remain in place for several days. We want to hear how you have been affected and how you are coping.
