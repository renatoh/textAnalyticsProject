Montreal", "bodyText": "Why? The food is good and there is life on the streets after 10 at night, which is always important. There is something exotic about the mixture of French and English. The best thing? The Canadian Centre for Architecture. It's way beyond anything we have here to serve and promote architecture. My ideal day: After breakfast, I'd wander round the old town. I would have a jolly good lunch, a bit of a sleep and then walk to the top of a place they call The Mountain, which is just a high hill set in parkland, and look down on the city. My advice: Stay in one of the small hotels in the old French quarter, notably the Hotel Gault (00 514 904 1616, Hotel Gault). What do you never travel without? An A4 sketch pad and pencils, usually 6B, often paints. Getting there: Air Canada (0871 2201111, Air Canada) flies Heathrow-Montreal from \u00a3400pp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
