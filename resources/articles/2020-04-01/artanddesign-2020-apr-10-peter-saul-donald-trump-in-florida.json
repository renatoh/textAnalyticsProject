The president is the monster in the mud: a greedy Florida alligator with a diseased, spotty hide. His orange coiffure sits on two such beasts, one chewing greenbacks in its enormous teeth. His head, sporting its notorious complacent smile, sprouts from another pot-bellied reptile. Say it again \u2026 Indeed, America\u2019s great maverick of misrule, the octogenarian Saul lamented that everyone had got there first when it came to insulting Trump. In the painter\u2019s gleefully offensive career he\u2019s used various presidents as conduits for laying bare the grotesqueries of power, including Nixon, Reagan and George W Bush. It\u2019s often said that the challenge with a figure so outre as Trump is that he\u2019s beyond satire. But Saul certainly has a good go. Talking trash \u2026 Saul initially developed his art\u2019s scorching sensibility as a way of pushing back against the pure aspirations of American abstract expressionism. Rejecting the high art dogma of the 1950s\u2019 reigning critic Clement Greenberg, he wanted to make figurative paintings and partly drew inspiration from the violent crime comics he\u2019d loved as a kid. His work has plenty in common with the satirical Mad magazine and its pointed embrace of \u201ctrash\u201d culture. Looney tunes \u2026 The artist has always been hell-bent on evoking heated reactions, whether he is tackling politics, war or art history\u2019s behemoths. Picasso\u2019s Guernica, which the artist learned of as a child, is one of a number of art icons he has parodied over the years to protest war or the degradations of mass culture. Its agonies were given a debased makeover in blaring Technicolor hues, while Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch was restaged with cartoon ducks. Body horror \u2026 One of Saul\u2019s key anti-Vietnam war works, Saigon from 1967, also references Guernica. Picasso\u2019s screaming animals and people are translated in a horror show of comic-book sexual violence, with Asian babes born of racist, misogynist stereotypes prey to rampaging GIs. The painting\u2019s psychedelic palm trees recur throughout Saul\u2019s work, suggesting the reverberations of America\u2019s imperialist crimes.
