Don't read on if you haven't seen episode 10 \u2013 and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers. Catch up with Rebecca Nicholson's episode nine blog Broken Hearts Oh Homeland, with your impenetrable metaphorical titles. Wait! I see what you've done \u2013 Walden's heart! It's literally broken! Then there's Jessica and Brody's marriage, surely dead in the water by now. And Nazir, whose love for Brody is being tested by the fact that Brody doesn't want to be his pet terrorist any more, and Saul, who has been arrested by the organisation for which he sacrificed his own marriage. Hearts? Who'd have them? Brody Some positives in this episode \u2013 giving Brody a secret job to do ramps up the always-effective tension, and Damian Lewis has become very good at scrabbling around an office looking for a number while people make noises outside the door. In return for Nazir letting Carrie go, he provided the key to Walden's heart, quite literally, which Nazir's lackey then operated remotely, leading to a murder-by-heart-attack that Brody really seemed to mean. I enjoyed seeing him tell Walden \"I disagree with everything you say and do,\" though \"I'm killing you\" was perhaps unnecessary (mind you this was quite a dark episode so it wasn't always easy to see what was going on). Does Brody really care about Carrie? I think so. He doesn't get that sweaty panic on for just any girl. And yet, it was all too easy. Nazir letting her go? Really? Nazir killing Walden in his office, not in public, and making it look like a heart attack? Why? There are two things that could be happening here. Either Brody is still working with Nazir and this is all part of a bigger plan, or Nazir is setting Brody up to take the fall for Walden's death, as revenge. If this were season one, I would be suspicious of the fact that Brody's fingerprints will be all over the pacemaker remote control, though in the season-two world of Homeland, it could just be that they won't take this into account. And much of this episode was classic season-two daftness. When Brody shouted \"Goddamnit!\" to Nazir several times over the phone, I wondered if it was a confession from the writers that yes, they've decided to go for the full Jack Bauer after all. Carrie All of which brings us on to Carrie, former super-spy, now mildly annoying narrative device reduced to causing drama by doing exactly the opposite of what she's been told. I had high hopes for this week following the shock crash at the start, particularly since it marked the return of jazz, which usually signals something interesting happening. But of course season-two Carrie would escape from one of the most dangerous men in the world, only to go back to a deserted mill, alone, unarmed, knowing that she is not only risking her own life but the operation that is under way to capture Nazir. Turning her into a horror movie cliche isn't in the spirit of the character. The only part that felt familiar was her discussion with Nazir about the nature of terrorism, but even that lacked previous subtlety \u2013 Carrie is all too aware of the CIA's culpability, after the mosque shooting that everyone has forgotten about in season one. And the ending felt unfinished, as if they'd just decided to call it a night because everyone was tired and wanted to go home. By having those big reveals so early on, the worry was this season would run out of steam. There are two episodes left, so I'm hoping that isn't the case, but it certainly feels like it could be. Notes and observations \u2022 The betrayal of Saul was a handy reminder that Estes is, as my mother would say, a wrong 'un. Seeing him taken away was gently devastating. \u2022 Finn Walden has gone from being a devious little scamp to remorseful, emotional suitor very quickly, hasn't he? Also, Dana's rejection \u2013 \"We killed it. Just the same way we killed that poor woman\" \u2013 has just walked away with the worst-dialogue-of-the-series honour. Bravo. \u2022 Estes drinks martinis! \u2022 For someone who can't have a house because he needs to move around so much, Dar Udal certainly knows how to get found, by eating at the same place, at the same time, every week. \u2022 Carrie's recovery from what looked like a violent car crash was remarkable. I suspect she had been at Quinn's Magical Medicine. \u2022 Brody calls the safe house \"posh\". Do Americans use that word? It sounded off. \u2022 Galvez alert \u2013 he conspicuously came back \"to help Carrie\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
