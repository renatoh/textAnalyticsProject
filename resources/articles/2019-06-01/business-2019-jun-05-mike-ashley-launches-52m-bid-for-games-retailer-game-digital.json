Ashley made the move after announcing that his stake in the business had risen to more than 38%, above the threshold requiring the tycoon to make a takeover bid for the entire business. Sports Direct, which also owns the House of Fraser chain, immediately announced a review of Game\u2019s 540 stores, which are located in the UK and Spain. \u201cThe review will focus on whether the existing Game sites should be consolidated with others in the Sports Direct Group [including House of Fraser], repurposed or closed,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe review could result in consolidation or closure of Game sites and a consequent reduction or relocation in the employment of Game\u2019s employees and management.\u201d Sports Direct, which first took a stake in Game in 2017, increased its 29.9% shareholding to 38.49% triggering its bid for full control. Sports Direct\u2019s 30p per share offer for Game represents a 27% premium to the company\u2019s closing share price on Tuesday, the last day of trading before the bid. Game\u2019s shares rose 23% on the news to 29p. The company said it intends to work with Game\u2019s management team to \u201cdevelop and review the existing strategic programme of repositioning and right sizing Game\u2019s retail business\u201d. Sports Direct also intends to further invest in, and expand, Game\u2019s eSports operation, Belong. \u201cThe retail and gaming sectors are fast moving and currently subject to challenging conditions,\u201d the company said. \u201cSports Direct does not believe that, as a standalone business, Game is able to weather the pressures that it is facing. Sports Direct\u2019s aim is to ensure Game\u2019s long-term sustainability and to escalate the evolution of the Belong business to accelerate the next stage of Game\u2019s development.\u201d Last year, Ashley increased his grip on Game striking a deal to rollout Belong in pay-to-play concessions in Sports Direct stores across the country. Sports Direct paid \u00a33.2m for 50% of the intellectual property owned by Belong including taking half the operation\u2019s profits. The deal also included Sports Direct providing a \u00a355m loan to Game\u2019s Spanish division to help fund development of more eSports venues in the country. Game Digital launched Belong in 2016 as part of a plan to move away from traditional retail sales, opening 19 venues. Ashley took a 25.75% stake in Game Digital in 2017 a month after the retailer issued a profit warning due to a supply shortage of Nintendo\u2019s hugely popular Switch console and a weaker lineup of new games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
