Bolt told Macquarie Radio on Wednesday night he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the knighthood decision. \u201cThis is just such a pathetically stupid \u2013 gosh, I didn\u2019t mean to be that strong because I actually like Tony Abbott very much \u2013 but this is just such a very, very, very stupid decision, so damaging that it could be fatal,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cI thought it was verging on fatal already but this is too much. \u201cThis is a friendless decision, where his friends would feel stupid defending it,\u201d he said. A Channel Seven ReachTel poll showed more than seven out of 10 Australians opposed the knighthood decision. The survey of nearly 3,700 people found only 12.1% supported the move to honour the British monarch, which Abbott announced on Australia Day. A total of 71.5% of those surveyed opposed the move. More than half of those who listed themselves as Coalition voters thought the knighthood was a bad idea. Abbott polled behind both Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop as preferred Liberal leader. Only 18% backed Abbott, against nearly 45% for Turnbull and 30.5% for Bishop. Nearly 62% of respondents said Abbott\u2019s performance as prime minister was poor or very poor. Just under 22% said it was good or very good, and the remainder said they were satisfied with his performance. The Liberal backbencher Dan Tehan welcomed Abbott\u2019s promise to consult more, and said there was room for the Coalition as a whole to lift its game. \u201cThe buck stops with all of us and we shouldn\u2019t forget that. I mean, the performance of the government, we are a team. We are a party,\u201d Tehan told the ABC. Voters were not exactly sold on Bill Shorten, either. Just over 27% said Shorten\u2019s performance as Labor leader was good or very good. More than 38% said his performance was poor or very poor, and nearly 36% were satisfied. The knighthood decision has sparked a barrage of criticism levelled at both Abbott and his chief of staff, Peta Credlin. Abbott\u2019s mentor, the former prime minister John Howard, relayed concerns from the party room about Credlin\u2019s influence in decision-making, Fairfax Media reported. On Wednesday the News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch called for Credlin to \u201cdo her patriotic duty\u201d and resign as chief of staff. The parliamentary secretary Alan Tudge said criticisms of Credlin and Abbott were a distraction. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t concerned with the internal machinations of the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d he said. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told ABC radio on Thursday morning the prime minister had \u201clearned his lesson\u201d on not consulting the cabinet about the knighthood decision. He downplayed growing calls for Abbott to be replaced as leader. \u201cThe prime minister enjoys the strong support of his party room. He enjoys my very strong and unequivocal support,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cHe is the best person to lead the Liberal party, to lead our country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
