Japanese voters are going to the polls on September 11, while the German electorate casts its ballots on September 18. But aside from their proximity, the two elections also have complementary themes running through them. In both cases the central issues and election platforms would have a familiar ring to voters in either Osaka or Osnabr\u00fcck. In recent years the economies of Japan and Germany - the second and third wealthiest in the world respectively - have resembled two heavyweight boxers past their best. Japan has been in the throes of a long slump since the start of the 1990s, and is still experiencing a period of deflation - a fall in the general level of prices - that is not expected to end until next year. Germany, similarly, has experienced stuttering growth and unsustainably high levels of unemployment since the afterglow of the fall of the Berlin wall: almost five million Germans remain out of work, more than 11% of the workforce. These recent performances are an especially stark contrast to what had gone before: Japan in the 1970s and 1980s was regarded with the same mixture of fear and awe at its economic prowess as China is today, while Germany's combination of education and efficient hi-tech manufacturing was widely admired. Indeed, both governments had steered their respective countries through the aftermath of the second world war. In doing so both adopted consensual styles of government. In Japan the Liberal Democrat party has ruled for all but two and a half years since 1948, while German governments have oscillated within the narrow spectrum between the centre-left of the Social Democrats and the centre-right of the Christian Democrats. In both countries the governments took active roles in directing their economies. The success of both led them to being held up as alternative role models to the Anglo-Saxon way of doing things. At the heart of both elections is an argument about the end of those models - in both cases the argument is over reform. The trigger for the Japan's election was prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's thwarted drive to privatise the country's vast post office, a national bank and pension provider whose assets run into trillions of dollars. In Germany, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's campaign to be re-elected as chancellor centres around the need for an overhaul of the welfare state, following his government's ambitious labour market shake-up. Normally in such situations the voters would be expected to be angry and eager to eject the ruling party. But - despite Mr Schr\u00f6der lagging in the polls - that is not entirely the case. In Germany the main opposition, led by Angela Merkel, is campaigning on a platform of even more radical reforms. In Japan it is the reforming incumbent Mr Koizumi who seems to be moving ahead into the lead and mounting an aggressive campaign to defeat anti-privatisation rebels in his own party. At this point citizens of Anglo-Saxon countries can afford to feel smug or be apprehensive, depending on their views. Britain went through the painful process of privatisation and welfare reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, enduring a divisive and turbulent period of politics. Germany and Japan, with their more consensual styles of government, resisted making such radical changes. But as the post-war miracles of both have worn thin, so views have changed. Now both countries are voting for reform."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
