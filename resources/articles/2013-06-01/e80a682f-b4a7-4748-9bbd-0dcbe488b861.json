The Barcelona player was being taken off the pitch in the 86th minute when he kicked more than once at the shoulder of the buggy driver. Mascherano looked incredulous when he was got off the cart to be greeted by a red card from the referee. Argentina had taken the lead through a Sergio Ag\u00fcero penalty in the fourth minute but Segundo Castillo headed an equaliser less than quarter of an hour later. A point for Argentina in the thin air of Quito kept them top of South America's World Cup qualifying standings with 27 points from 14 matches. Colombia are second with 26 points from 13 games after a 2-0 victory over Peru on Tuesday. Ecuador are in third with 22 points from 13 matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
