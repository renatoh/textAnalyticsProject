The Italian international is expected to retire after the World Cup at the age of 37. But even if he carries on he would miss at least the first two months of next season, whereas the 28-year-old King, who has won four caps, is unlikely to be involved in England's World Cup campaign. With the Zurich Premiership sides looking to cut their wage bills next season by 10%-15%, French clubs are casting covetous glances across the Channel. Pau last week signed the Leeds second-row Chris Murphy and Perpignan have had talks with the Harlequins and England wing Dan Luger. Perry Freshwater, the Leecester prop, is also considering an offer from a French club and Montferrand are con fident of signing Gloucester's French international hooker Olivier Azam. \"The tide has turned,\" said a leading agent yesterday. \"Up to now English clubs have been able to attract players from France because of the high salaries, but with most clubs now tightening their belts not only are wage levels dropping but they are looking to transfer some of their biggest earners. \"French clubs generally have bigger budgets and do not have a restrictive salary cap. They get assistance from local authorities and sponsors, and are able to put together packages which are hard to turn down.\" Toulouse are keen to sign the Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll and have also been linked with the England and Wasps' back-row Lawrence Dallaglio, though his club contract has another year to run. \"If two or three high-profile English players end up in France this season, then more are likely to follow,\" said Dallaglio. \"I am staying at Wasps, but the situation is going to be very interesting over the next 12 months.\" Wales will appoint a new coach in 12 months to replace Steve Hansen, who has said he intends to return to New Zealand. The Welsh Rugby Union's general manager Steve Lewis said the successor would be one of the coaches of the five new regional teams. The coaches are Gareth Jenkins (Llanelli), Mike Ruddock (Newport/Ebbw Vale), David Young (Cardiff), Lyn Jones (Swansea/Neath) and Lynn Howells (Pontypridd/Bridgend). Their management teams will be decided before the end of the month and squads will then be chosen. \"Steve has always said he will not renew his contract and we are working on the assumption that he will be returning to New Zealand,\" said Lewis. \"His successor will come from the regions and we will either have candidates shadowing him during the World Cup or in the Six Nations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
