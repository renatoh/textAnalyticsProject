Shares in the company continued to slide yesterday after it issued its second profits warning in three months, saying full-year pretax profits would be substantially below market expectations. The company said an advertising campaign on daytime television failed to arrest the decline in customer numbers and losses were expected to reach \u00a320m. Last year the firm averaged 4,000 customers a month. Revelations in November that clients had received derisory payouts caused a decline and in January only 2,500 customers signed up. Finance director Paul Doona admitted the firm had failed to drive up the number of registrations, despite spending millions of pounds on TV advertising. He said customer numbers averaged 2,500 a month in the first quarter of the year. The company would bounce back next year following cost-cutting measures, including cuts in staff at the company's head office, he insisted. The company had written to its national network of 300 franchised claims managers, who conduct initial interviews with personal injury victims, offering them compensation to end their relationship with Claims Direct. More than 30 had already taken up the offer. Chief executive Colin Poole also tried to soothe City nerves with the announcement of an insurance product that aims to protect the first \u00a31,000 of a client's claim. The premium is \u00a31,495, paid for by a loan to the customer. The loan is written off should a customer lose the case. If the company succeeds in pursuing the claim, it will seek compensation from the other party's insurer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
