Morrison is travelling to to Townsville on Friday to unveil the package, which also includes a doubling of assistance for flood-affected small businesses from $25,000 to $50,000. The policy \u2013 including the establishment of a north Queensland livestock industry recovery agency \u2013 closely resembles a proposal by independent MP Bob Katter, who threatened to help Labor recall parliament unless the government set up a cattle reconstruction board to give low-interest loans to farmers. While initial news reports in the Courier Mail and the Australian valued the package at up to $2bn, Morrison suggested the government\u2019s commitment is open-ended, telling Radio National it will \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d when asked if a budget allocation had been made. \u201cWe don\u2019t [have a final price tag],\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we still don\u2019t even know now the full extent of the losses. \u201cThere\u2019s been estimates of half a million stock losses, but I\u2019ve heard higher than that, and the water is still draining \u2013 when I was up there a little while ago stock was still dying from pneumonia.\u201d Morrison said the policy will consist of restructuring existing loans and restocking herds through a combination of grants and loans, to be made either through banks or the Regional Investment Corporation. The prime minister said the government would use a form of guarantee to underwrite bank loans and \u201creduce the cost of funds\u201d. \u201cAll of that cost of funds will be passed on to each of the farmers in their restructuring of their existing debts, and that is the same for the restocking loans as well.\u201d Interest rates will \u201cdepend on people\u2019s holdings\u201d but would be \u201ca hell of a lot lower than they\u2019re paying right now, basically on what the cost of funds is\u201d, Morrison said. \u201c[It will be at the rates] the government gets, which at the moment is about 2.7% to 3%, but in some cases you can structure the debt so it can be as low as 1%.\u201d Morrison said the policy will help graziers rebuild \u201cstation by station, farm by farm\u201d, suggesting that different recovery plans will be needed for each business. He said farmers \u201cdon\u2019t want compensation, [they] want reconstruction\u201d. Katter took credit, saying in a statement the catalyst for the decision was his invitation to the prime minister to visit Julia Creek and Cloncurry. \u201cSo after 25 years of battle, we have got an enlightened government decision,\u201d Katter said \u201cAll these people will have their debt significantly reduced, and will now be paying one third of what they were currently paying to the banks (until now). And all of this is costing the tax payers nothing.\u201d In February Morrison said he was working with Katter on the issue \u201cbecause the northern Australian cattle industry needs our support\u201d, rebuffing suggestions the negotiations were designed to avoid extra sitting weeks. In November Katter and Morrison reached a deal in which he agreed to provide $200m for water projects to shore up Katter\u2019s support in the House of Representatives following the loss of the government\u2019s lower house majority. In February Morrison hinted he could revoke the deal if the maverick MP sided with Labor and fellow crossbenchers to support an extension of the parliamentary sitting calendar against the government\u2019s wishes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
