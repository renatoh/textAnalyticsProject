But there really needs to be a way of effectively memorialising a band such as Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 far bigger than a mere cult, a bit smaller than a phenomenon; fundamentally punk rock, but with all the glamour of a high-end pop product. Their triumphs in the actuarial department may seem modest, compared with those of the multi-platinum brigade. Their bestselling album, 2003's Fever to Tell, clocked up 205,000 sales; every one since has sold less. But their stubborn magnificence is the sort that defies pen-sucking or bean-counting. It's a particularly slippery job, nailing down the mercury that is singer Karen Orzolek, one of the finest front-people of her generation. There is no accounting for impact. Dressed tonight in a spangly, geometric-patterned shorts suit, with one old-school silver kneepad and one trademark red fingerless glove, she waggles her microphone as though it was a captive snake (the cord is neon yellow; the mic striped pink and green). Later she'll spit water into the air like a human geyser and execute backbends while growling. Old favourites such as Maps (from their 2003 debut, Fever to Tell) and newer songs such as Wedding Song (dedicated to Karen O's husband, Barney) find this dynamo briefly at rest, crooning delicate declarations of love, bringing some of the crowd to tears. Has O ever had an off-night? I first saw Yeah Yeah Yeahs 11 years ago in a pub upstairs room not much smaller than this intimate, 300-capacity venue where the Yeahs are now warming down from their performance at T in the Park, and warming up for their set at Latitude today. In the heat, they're touring Mosquito, their fourth album, one that finds the trio stepping back slightly from the sleek production values of their last two offerings, rewinding to a slightly rawer sound. Nick Zinner's guitar-playing remains nervy and hostile, laden with as many effects as exist in the guitar shop, while Brian Chase, looking solemn and professorial, but drumming like a fiend, supplies the kind of versatile beats that span art-punk and synth-pop (he does jazz in his spare time). Their touring second guitarist is David Pajo, previously a major underground deity (he was in a band called Slint, held in awed regard by post-rock fans of a certain vintage). Hilariously, this august figure now prods keyboards, beefing up Yeah Yeah Yeahs' disco numbers. Their most accessible entry point, Zero, finds Karen O wearing a studded leather jacket with \"KO\" on the back, delivering a knock-out punch of club-pop, pogoing gleefully all the while. Chase, Orzolek and Zinner were jaw-dropping all those years ago; they are even more enthralling now they have a back catalogue. The last time YYYs played London, in May, they headlined their own festival at the cavernous Alexandra Palace. Tonight, we're virtually invading their personal space. I can see a bruise on Orzolek's thigh when she stamps a foot down, triggering a glitter cannon that spews out shimmery pink and blue Ys. They even take requests, slipping in Art Star from their debut EP, the highlight of which comes when Karen O deep-throats the microphone in a squall of noise. They really have come far. This New York trio have outlived their peers, the Strokes and the White Stripes, even though internal ructions threatened to sink them more than once. If they were starting out nowadays, you'd be tempted to describe the band as something like the Black Keys fronted by Lady Gaga, only with a headful of highlights: a punk rock streak, and a disco streak, and a dub streak and others that defy categorisation. No choir could squeeze on stage tonight, but the gospel-tinged Sacrilege \u2013 one of Mosquito's more immediate cuts \u2013 stands out regardless, with the crowd supplying the chorus, DIY-style. By contrast, the song's beautifully shot video features a model \u2013 Lily Cole \u2013 being burned alive. Despair, another Mosquito offering, packs in more contradictions. It's a tender love song to depression, whose video \u2013 again, beautifully shot, this time atop the Empire State Building \u2013 uses the New York dawn to nudge the track towards hope. Despair is an affliction hard to square with the effervescent Orzolek, who goes about her provocative strutting and fretting not with the antagonism of a punk, nor the pouting of a mainstream female, but with a huge Cheshire cat grin. If their bad times are good times, then their good times are even better. Heads Will Roll finds Karen O swapping Cheshire cat for the Queen of Hearts. \"Off with your head!\" she commands, \"dance till you're dead!\" If someone developed an app that measured fun, Yeah Yeah Yeahs would be its baseline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
