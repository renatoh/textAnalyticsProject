His hair is white these days, the perm long gone, and his belly more rounded, but otherwise he is little changed. Keegan is as passionate and outspoken as he ever was. We meet in a hotel in Manchester. It\u2019s funny that he\u2019s written another memoir, he says, because he hates looking back. \u201cI don\u2019t like player reunions because all you get is the lads talking about whatever year you won something. A lot of them are just lost in that. Sir John Hall had a saying: \u2018If you live in the past, you die in the past.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to reinvent yourself \u2013 try to move on.\u201d He might not have much time for reminiscing, but with Keegan there is always a significant career anniversary to mark. So it\u2019s 50 years since he made his debut for Scunthorpe United, 45 since he claimed the first of his three league titles with Liverpool, 40 since he won the first of two successive European Player of the Year awards at Hamburg, 25 since the season he managed Newcastle United to the first division title, 20 next February since he was named England manager, and 10 since he walked out on Newcastle United for the second time (his last job in management). Few Englishmen have played and managed with such raw emotion. Keegan is a fascinating, and contradictory, character \u2013 one of the most decent, reliable and transparent men in football, yet at the same time short-fused, unpredictable and inscrutable. He has always been one of football\u2019s great believers; by nature an optimist and idealist. The flip side is a zero tolerance of cheats, bullshitters, and at times, you sense, even of himself. His book opens with him returning to St James\u2019 Park in disguise after falling out with owner Mike Ashley who he felt had made him persona non grata. His second time managing Newcastle United was a horror show. Things came to a head in 2008 after discovering Ashley\u2019s cronies had bought the Spaniard Xisco for \u00a35.7m despite never having seen him play, and signed the Uruguayan Ignacio Gonza\u0301lez on loan as a \u201cfavour\u201d to two South American agents. When Keegan went ballistic he was told not to worry, he could just \u201cpark\u201d Gonza\u0301lez \u2013 he didn\u2019t even have to play him in the reserves. Keegan quit, and was awarded \u00a32m for constructive dismissal by a tribunal in 2009. I tell him I felt sickened when I read about the culture at the club. Yes, Keegan says, but Ashley\u2019s Newcastle are not representative of modern football; they are the worst of the worst. \u201cThey are a real one-off. I don\u2019t know of a club that has been run as badly or with such disregard for people.\u201d Ironically, Ashley called Keegan \u201cthe most honest man in football\u201d. Does he accept that compliment? He smiles. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to take a compliment from Mike Ashley.\u201d Keegan has never been able to stay shtum when he sees slights and injustices. In the new book, pacily ghosted by the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Taylor, he doesn\u2019t hold back. So he calls out Brian Clough for bullying, Alex Ferguson for gamesmanship, the FA for not supporting him as England manager, Bobby Robson for not telling him why he was dropping him from the England squad, Lawrie McMenemy for suggesting he was not trying in a Southampton match and calling his team cheats (for Keegan, the worst accusation you could make), Liverpool for their arrogance, Manchester City for their parsimony. And, of course, he doesn\u2019t hold back on himself. After all, this is the man who said he wasn\u2019t up to managing England and promptly quit. In his book The Chimp Paradox the psychiatrist Steve Peters says too much emotion is often the ruin of an athlete. It has certainly got the better of Keegan at times \u2013 when he got sent off for scrapping with Leeds United\u2019s Billy Bremner in the 1974 Charity Shield; the famous finger-jabbing \u201cI will love it\u201d rant when Newcastle were challenging Manchester United for the Premier League title and he allowed Ferguson\u2019s mind-games to get the better of him. But it\u2019s also been the making of him. He talks about the time that Hall, then chairman of Newcastle, approached him to manage the club the first time. \u201cHe said the two people talking to each other right now can save Newcastle United \u2013 you\u2019ve got the passion, I\u2019ve got the money.\u201d And he admits it was the same passion that led him to quit when Hall put the club on the stock market. \u201cIt was this greed to get every penny they could from the float. This guy from the City, Mark Corbidge, was basically running the club, and he asked me to sign a 10-year contract now or leave. I just walked out. I walked back home and said to [his wife] Jean: \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 She said: \u2018What are we going to do?\u2019 I said: \u2018We\u2019re going to America NOW!\u2019\u201d Did she ever get upset with his impetuousness? \u201cJean used to say to me I was mad. She\u2019d say: \u2018You should have stayed there,\u2019 but she knows that\u2019s not for me.\u201d Why has he left so many jobs? \u201cI don\u2019t like people to deceive me and tell me lies.\u201d He taps the table and goes straight on to his next bete noire \u2013 clubs that lack ambition. Say the word \u201cconsolidate\u201d to Keegan and he\u2019ll head straight for the door \u2013 as happened with Manchester City. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going forward, what\u2019s the point in sticking around? If the chairman says we\u2019re looking forward to consolidate, that\u2019s the time for you to say as a manager we\u2019ll go backwards.\u201d George Best, a friend, said that as a player Keegan wasn\u2019t fit to lace his boots. And in a way he was right. But what Keegan had was a ferocious determination. He chased like a terrier, ran defenders ragged, beat giant defenders in the air despite being only 5ft 7in, and willed himself into being one of the footballing greats. No player exceeded his potential like Keegan. He captained England 33 times and succeeded wherever he played \u2013 top scorer in the league at Southampton in 1982, a hero when he retired, helicoptered away from the adoring Newcastle fans at St James\u2019 Park after his final game like the statue of Christ in La Dolce Vita. Keegan is the only British player to have won two Ballons d\u2019Or. He admits he was the beneficiary of Best\u2019s boozed-up unreliability. When Best didn\u2019t turn up for gigs, they were passed on to Keegan. There were Keegan newspaper columns, Keegan football boots, even a Keegan hit record (Head Over Heels in Love). He adored Best. \u201cI wanted so much to have his ability. His skill was unbelievable. I played against Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Maradona. But I still say Besty was the best I played against.\u201d He has little time for those who say Best threw his life away. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever have anything other than maximum respect for Besty. He loved his life. He never left anything behind. He had a great life. He did all the things he wanted to do and nobody was going to stop him. That was his character.\u201d Given that Keegan was not the most naturally gifted footballer, is he surprised by how much he achieved? \u201cYes, amazing really. I look at the players who have won the Ballon d\u2019Or, right back to Stanley Matthews. You\u2019ve got players in there like Platini and Cruyff. Then you see my name there twice!\u201d If he was playing today, who he would most like to be managed by? \u201cI\u2019d have to go for [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp because he\u2019s like me.\u201d It\u2019s that passion thing again. \u201cHe is going to tackle someone one day. \u201cI was very close to it [too]. When someone was breaking away and it was near the touchline, and I was stood there, I was very close one day to bringing him down. I really was.\u201d I ask Keegan what has given him most happiness in football. He doesn\u2019t mention the trophies or personal achievements. \u201cBobby Moore leading me out for England, with Alf Ramsey as manager. That was unbelievable. Bobby Moore saying when I joined the England squad: \u2018We\u2019re going out tonight, be down at seven\u2019, and he had a big red Jag and took eight or 10 of us into town to a club. It would be illegal now. That was very special.\u201d He looks emotional, just thinking about it. \u201cNothing beat playing for England for me. Being made captain, leading your team out. We never did great in my time, but that\u2019s probably the happiest it gets.\u201d But he has few happy memories of his time as England manager. Keegan lasted 20 months and 18 games, winning only seven of them \u2013 the worst win ratio of any England manager, and his one true failure in football. Why did he say he wasn\u2019t up to the job when he quit? \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t like it \u2013 that\u2019s another way of putting it. I like everyday team\u2011building with players. People say, \u2018Well tactically you weren\u2019t very good\u2019, but tactically what can you do with players when you don\u2019t have them?\u201d I mention he has never been sacked as a manager. Keegan drums his fingers on the table. \u201cI would have been sacked as England manager after the Germany game. I\u2019d already been told by the FA that results had to improve. So I just made it easy for them. But yeah, I walked away from a lot of money if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Despite England reaching the semi-final of this year\u2019s World Cup, he still believes the job is a poisoned chalice. Is it a big ask for Gareth Southgate to take England further forward? \u201cWell, I think it is because I\u2019m sure if you got Gareth in a room and said truthfully did you expect to get this far, he\u2019d say no \u2026 He\u2019s got the same problem that England have had for a long time since Gazza went. Where\u2019s your Eden Hazard, your David Silva, your De Bruyne? Where are they? There\u2019s an orchestra there, but nobody to conduct.\u201d Actually, he says, for England to succeed long term, Southgate would have to be a miracle-worker. He believes Southgate\u2019s biggest challenge is that many squad members are not even regulars in their team. \u201cThere\u2019s the miracle he\u2019s got to work whereby he\u2019s got players sat on benches watching players, and expect them to play against those players who are playing every week and have leadership roles in the team.\u201d And he talks about the other problems \u2013 the reluctance of the big clubs to give English kids a chance despite nurturing them in their academies; the failure to appoint successful English managers such as Eddie Howe to the top jobs, the exaltation of foreign managers who park the bus and are called defensive maestros. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a Mourinho masterclass.\u2019 I get the feeling if that had been me or Sam Allardyce ... ppfff, we wouldn\u2019t get away with it.\u201d Keegan has always seemed content in his prolonged periods away from football. \u201cI miss the banter with players as a manager. I miss playing, but I\u2019ve been missing that for 34 years. Nothing beats playing. Management is just a way of staying in the game you love for a bit longer \u2026\u201d He grins. \u201cAnd sometimes very short periods.\u201d In his book, he points out that Winston Churchill was 76 when he began his second term as prime minister. Could Keegan be tempted back for one final stint in management? \u201cI have had opportunities, that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, but when you say that you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2026 because if someone came in like Sir John Hall did and said, \u2018You\u2019ve got the passion, I\u2019ve got the money\u2019, you think, \u2018Wow, we could do something there\u2019.\u201d He is juggling the possibilities in his head. \u201cI\u2019m 67, almost 68,\u201d he says, apparently writing himself off. But a second later there\u2019s a glint in his eye. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the oldest manager!\u201d Kevin Keegan: My Life in Football will be published by Macmillan on 4 October, \u00a320."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
