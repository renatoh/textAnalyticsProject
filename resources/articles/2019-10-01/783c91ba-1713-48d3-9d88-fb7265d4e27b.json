Yet on several occasions he also refused to fully condemn the man who mentored him to glory. On the one hand it was easy to understand Farah\u2019s frustrations. This was not a press conference to promote the Chicago Marathon, where Britain\u2019s most successful athlete will defend his title, but a sustained grilling. Time and again his relationship with Salazar was picked over, much like it has been since 2015, when allegations about his former coach first surfaced. But nothing new? How could Farah claim that when Salazar was handed a ban for what the US Anti-Doping Agency called \u201corchestrated doping\u201d barely a week ago? And when the Nike Oregon Project, the training group who turned him from world class to world beater, had been disbanded by Nike only hours earlier? Repeatedly Farah spoke of \u201callegations\u201d against Salazar, not the ruling of guilt established in two years of arbitration hearings. Perhaps a wiser public relations strategy would have been to admit he should have dumped Salazar when Usada first began an investigation in 2015. Instead, when Farah was asked whether he felt let down by Salazar, his prime response was to turn his crosshairs on the media. \u201cI feel let down by you guys to be honest,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is very disappointing to see you guys going at it again and again. The headline is Farah, Farah, Farah. There is no allegation against me. I\u2019ve not done anything wrong. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 these allegations are about Alberto Salazar and the Oregon Project.\u201d The question was asked again. Again Farah refused to directly answer it. \u201cIf I tell you guys, or talk to you guys and be nice to you, you\u2019ll still be negative,\u201d he said. \u201cEither way, I can\u2019t win, you\u2019ve already made up your mind about what you\u2019re going to write.\u201d There was a sharper twist of the knife when Farah accused the British press of racism. \u201cAs much as I am nice to you, there is a clear agenda to this,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen this many times. I have seen it with Raheem Sterling, with Lewis Hamilton. I cannot win whatever I do.\u201d When pressed, Farah was eventually critical of Salazar, saying his former coach had made promises to him in 2015 that had turned out to be false. \u201cI pulled out of a race in Birmingham because I wanted some answers,\u201d Farah said. \u201cI flew to Portland, talked to Alberto face to face. He assured me at the time these are just allegations. And that hasn\u2019t been true.\u201d Notably, Farah said he would be happy for his samples to be retested by anti-doping agencies. \u201cI am probably one of the most tested athletes in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI am happy to be tested any time and anywhere, and for my samples to be used for whatever they need to do.\u201d Farah\u2019s media conference came barely 12 hours after the Nike Oregon Project was closed by the Nike chief executive, Mark Parker, because it had become a continuing distraction to its athletes. Parker pointed out the panel who imposed the doping ban on Salazar found no \u201corchestrated doping\u201d or evidence performance-enhancing drugs have been used on Oregon Project athletes. Salazar has said he will appeal. Nevertheless, it is an ignominious end for a training group once regarded as the best in the world. Its genesis lay in a conversation between Salazar and Nike\u2019s Tom Clarke, currently the company\u2019s president of innovation, while they watched the Boston Marathon in 2001. After an announcer went wild when an American finished sixth, Clarke turned to Salazar and said: \u201cHave things got so bad we are celebrating that?\u201d Salazar told him he could coach Americans to be competitive again. The Oregon project was born. Nothing was left to chance. Soon afterwards the NOP\u2019s leading athlete Galen Rupp, who won medals at London 2012 and the Rio Olympics in 2016, was living in an \u201caltitude house\u201d in Portland, with an air-filtering system that simulated high-altitude oxygen tents and naturally boosted his haemoglobin levels. In the following years wherever technology and science went, Salazar gleefully followed \u2013 whether it was by using cryotherapy, underwater treadmills or high-altitude training camps spread across the year. However, in 2015 the BBC and ProPublica raised serious questions about some of Salazar\u2019s methods, including the use of the banned drug testosterone on his sons in a bizarre experiment. That sparked a formal investigation by Usada, who last month announced that Salazar had been banned for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d. In its later years the Oregon Project expanded to include non-Americans, with Farah joining the group in late 2010. \u201cHe was flitting around before joining us,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cHis training was haphazard. He was all over the place. He did no weight training. He would jog and do five minutes of drills with no stretching afterwards. And technically, Mo tended to overstride towards the end of races.\u201d When asked whether he was pleased Salazar had been kicked out of the sport, Farah again was slightly evasive. \u201cI have no time for anyone who has crossed the line, and from day one I said that,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd if that is proven that he crossed the line, it\u2019s Usada\u2019s decision, that is all we can do.\u201d Farah also insisted he had been unaware Salazar had been charged by Usada in 2017 until his ban was announced at the end of September. And when asked whether he was saddened at the Oregon Project being shut down, his reply was hardly emphatic. \u201cI am back in London, I have been out of the Oregon Project two years. It is not my decision to shut down the Oregon Project, it is a Usada decision, a Nike decision. That is Nike not me, I am Mo Farah.\u201d But you are still wearing Nike kit, one journalist pointed out. \u201cNike pay me a lot of money,\u201d came the retort. And on this point, at least, there was rare agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
