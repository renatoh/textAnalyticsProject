The head of Ofsted says in his annual review of children\u2019s social care that too many councils are still neither sufficiently alert to the problem of sexual exploitation locally nor suitably equipped to provide services able to respond. Wilshaw said child abuse scandals in Rotherham and elsewhere had shown that the strong leadership required in this field of child protection work was frequently lacking. \u201cFaced with such shocking crimes, senior leaders must show political and moral courage. They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,\u201d he says. A report into sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham, South Yorkshire last year found police and council officials failed to act on evidence that abuse was being committed on a wide scale by mostly Asian men. Organised child abuse has also been uncovered in Rochdale, Derby and Oxfordshire. But Wilshaw admitted that Ofsted inspectors had also failed to take abuse of children by criminal gangs seriously enough. Its inspection of Rotherham\u2019s child protection arrangements in 2012 was, he said, \u201cnot good enough.\u201d The review reveals that three-quarters of the 43 local authority child protection departments inspected during 2013-14 were found to be inadequate or requiring improvement. Just 10 were rated good. Wilshaw pointed out that child protection services were experiencing stark increases in demand at a time when the government was making large cuts to council budgets, putting intense pressure on safeguarding services. The review found that in 2013-14: The number of children in need in England increased by 5% to 397,600 Children on child protection plans increased by 12% to 48,300 The number of youngsters being looked after by councils rose by 1% and is at its highest level since 1987 Wilshaw said: \u201cSocial care professionals are often expected to do more with the same or less, all the while knowing that the actions they take and the decisions they make can dramatically change the course of a child\u2019s life. \u201cGrowing public scrutiny and criticism only adds to that pressure. I make no apology for Ofsted carrying out robust inspections of these services on behalf of the children and young people who use them. \u201cBut we must recognise the context and constraints within which social workers and their managers work. They have a difficult and demanding role and do not always get the support and recognition they deserve.\u201d Almost half of the children defined as in need in 2013-14 were assessed as at risk of abuse or neglect. A fifth were deemed to suffer from \u201cfamily dysfunction\u201d. The review adds: \u201cIt is likely that Ofsted inspections of local authorities will continue to identify unmet need and limited support for families and children, unless rising demand is matched by new resource or new solutions.\u201d It identifies high turnover of frontline social workers and widespread problems recruiting experienced staff. Consistency of leadership is a problem, it says, with one in three local authorities changing their director of social services last year. Cllr David Simmonds, chairman of the local government association\u2019s children and young people board, said the report demonstrated the pressure the child protection system was under. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are creaking under the strain as they work to protect the most vulnerable children from abuse, neglect and child sexual exploitation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an NHS system failing to cope with winter pressures, the government recently pledged \u00a32bn to alleviate the crisis. We need Whitehall to redress the balance and give us adequate resources we need to get on with the vital job of protecting children. \u201cHigh-profile crimes of abuse and neglect have brought sharply into focus the need for vigilance. As a result, there are rightly thousands more children on the radar of social services now. But this is in a climate where councils have faced cuts to their budgets of 40% since 2010.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cNothing is more important than keeping children safe. That\u2019s why we have worked relentlessly to transform the life chances of our most vulnerable children and our plan is working \u2013 something this report makes clear. \u201cWe have recruited more social workers than ever before; for the first time ever, children\u2019s homes are required to prove how they\u2019re supporting children to thrive both inside and outside the home; we\u2019ve introduced tough new rules on councils to interview children who return from going missing within 72 hours and are intervening in 25 councils to ensure children are receiving the services they deserve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
