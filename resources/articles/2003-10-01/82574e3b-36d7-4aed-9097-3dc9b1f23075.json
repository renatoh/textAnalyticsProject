Paterson came under fire following his side's 3-0 home defeat at the hands of Livingston in the Scottish Premier League on Saturday. It had been claimed that the Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies was being lined up to replace Paterson but the Aberdeen chief executive Keith Wyness moved quickly to quash speculation that the axe was about to fall on the Dons' manager. But Paterson himself admits he must turn around the club's fortunes by Christmas. He said: \"My job is 100% safe. When you get stuff coming out about me getting sacked after seven games with Jim Jefferies taking over, it is ridiculous. Until the start of this season I would say that I have done a good job. \"We are not doing well but you have to look at the bigger picture. I came to the club when it was in free fall in a genuine relegation fight and turned that around to get us into a respectable eighth position. \"Come Christmas if we get a series of Livingston-type results then that is a different story. But I know I am capable of sorting things out.\" The Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne claims Paterson still has the full backing of the Dons' board and insisted that he would not bow to pressure to resign after fans called for him to quit. In an official statement, Milne said: \"The club has had a dismal start to the season - there is no getting away from that. However, the management team, like the board, is in this for the long haul and we are giving them the time, and our full support, to turn things around. \"With current poor results, it is completely understandable that the fans are disillusioned and angry. As a fan, I have every sympathy with them. It is also predictable that there are renewed calls for a board shake-up. \"However, the board remains united and clear in its strategy for going forward and I have no plans to resign unless, of course, a suitable successor comes forward.\" The referee who sent the Celtic manager Martin O'Neill to the stands during last season's Uefa Cup game with Celta Vigo at Parkhead will take charge of Scotland's crucial Euro 2004 qualifier with Lithuania later this month. The Frenchman Claude Colombo has been appointed by Uefa to officiate the October 11 clash at Hampden Park which Berti Vogts' men must win to stand a chance of making the play-offs. The Hibernian managing director Rod Petrie has urged supporters not to tarnish the club's reputation any further following several incidents so far this season. The first Edinburgh derby of the season against Hearts was marred when a fan made his way on to the pitch at half-time in an attempt to attack the referee Stuart Dougal, minutes after the official had sent off the midfielder Grant Brebner. The Easter Road club have escaped punishment from the Scottish Football Association following the incident. The supporter was fined \u00a31,000 for breach of the peace at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. That was followed by stone-throwing by two young supporters in the match against Motherwell a fortnight ago and, most recently, toilet rolls being thrown on to the pitch during the 9-0 CIS Insurance Cup win against Montrose. Hibs have increased their security measures but Petrie has called upon supporters to ensure their reputation does not suffer further. Petrie told the Edinburgh Evening News: \"Following the incident in the derby we have reviewed security and, a couple of minutes before the half-time and full-time whistles, the stewards who have been seated in the spectator areas move out trackside. \"There is a more visible presence and this change was noted by the referee supervi sor at our match against Aberdeen in his report to the SFA. \"The disciplinary committee was also pleased at the size of the fine imposed on this particular spectator believing that strong action in the courts will act as a deterrent. \"At the Motherwell match, supporters in the vicinity ensured the culprits, two young boys aged eight and 10, were identified and the quick action we took satisfied the committee. \"However, two reports against our club is two too many. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and we should not underestimate the damage done to the club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
