Their officials do not work for the deputy prime minister and, as such, it is absolute nonsense to suggest that the DPM has sent anyone working for the VOA to the US.\" We hear you, John! Four days earlier, he was laying into the Save Britain's Heritage report. \"This report is utter nonsense. Save clearly are only interested in ill-informed scaremongering, not the facts.\" Anger management may be helping John, but the Backbencher can't help suspecting that a little displacement activity is going on. That Sun headline (\"PRESCOTT IS A DUNCE\") didn't deserve to be dignified with a response, of course, but how about the revelation that a tenth of ODPM staff have felt \"victimised\" in the past year? John? John? No need for that, John! FLAGGING TORIES A word in the ear of certain Tory MPs who insist on flying the union flag at the top of their websites: Don't feed in news from Conservative central office without checking the contents first. Headlines like \"Britishness is not about flag flying\" just make you look confused. GURU GOING CHEAP The Backbencher assumed that Lynton Crosby had taken the first flight back to Canberra after last May's elections, never to return. But it turns out that blatant failure in the political sphere can be just as lucrative as the ability to run a blue-chip company into the ground. Still, at least his fees have dropped. Interested parties need only pay GBP10 to listen to Lynton talking about \"election strategy and the revitalisation of global conservatism\" on Monday in Mayfair. No doubt Dave is hoping he means Canada. FED-EX FOR GORDON Bob Geldof's kidnapping by the Tories has left Gordon in need of a celebrity endorsement - and one he filled today with the ample help of Dr Alan Greenspan. The two have been close for a while - Gordon invited Alan to address his father's Presbyterian church last year on the topic of Adam Smith - and the former chairman of the Federal Reserve will serve as the chancellor's honorary advisor. The Backbencher advises the doctor to tread carefully. When it comes to helping Gordon, invisible hands are the best. LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION \"Eithaf paham Lembit anghenion 'r Cymraeg Chyman renamed fel Cymraeg Senedd a canfod agorai at 80 aelodau ydy mystifying.\"* Is it really OK to use English words in a Welsh sentence? The Backbencher can't help feeling that it isn't, but Nick Shaxted surely deserves the prize for submitting his answer in Welsh. \"It's all those Welsh lessons Sian is giving him!\" writes another reader. Well, Lembit needs all the help he can get. * \"Quite why Lembit wants the Welsh assembly renamed as Welsh Senedd and see it expanded to 80 members is mystifying.\" THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION The Backbencher has a special prize for worried Tories this week - a copy of Palgrave Macmillan's The Political Thought of the Conservative Party since 1945. It includes an essay by Simon Heffer attacking, among other loathsome developments, \"soi-disant Tories\" who talk about \"inclusivity\" and a piece by Francis Maude titled \"Centre\". For a chance of winning a copy, just tell us which announcement provoked the following reaction in Lord Tebbit at last night's Bow Group meeting: \"The expression 'the mind boggles' is inadequate on this occasion\".

FROM MICHAEL WHITE IN WESTMINSTER \"Today's PMQs didn't throw up any great dramas, though it certainly threw up an enormous cry of 'resign' as Mr Blair rose to his feet for the first time. This, of course, was a reflection on the two defeats that thwarted the government's version of the racial and religious hatred bill in the Commons last night. When the chief whip, Hilary Armstrong, who is taking the blame for the defeat, slipped into her seat there were cheers for her as well, and a good time had by all. \"Mr Blair was quick to deploy a sombre note, calming the jeers by addressing the grief and bereavement of families who've lost members in Iraq. All the political leaders prefaced their questions with an acknowledgement of the death of the 100th British soldier there. The Rev Dr Ian Paisley, who has preached, no doubt, many thousands of sermons lowered his voice and said how difficult it was to articulate bereavement. And it was interesting that the whole house listened to Dr Paisley at that moment. \"He went on to ask a very awkward question about the International Monitoring Commission and its report suggesting that the IRA may not have destroyed all its weapons, as it told General de Chastelain's committee last autumn. Mr Blair kicked it into touch. \"However, as ever, the big question is David Cameron. How did he do? Well, he was very articulate and amusing. He wondered aloud whether it was right for Miss Armstrong to let it be known that Mr Blair had gone home early and as a result the government had lost one vote by only one vote - Mr Blair's. Mr Cameron said it was probably the first time in the history of chief whip-ship that the chief whip has put the prime minister in the frame for losing a vote. Then he paused and said in that stylish way of his: 'an interesting career move', and everybody laughed again. \"That said, Mr Cameron can't go on every week talking about the same two subjects, which is what he appears to do: education first, and then the environment. \"He used to be education spokesman and he quite recently went to school - so I suppose he knows quite a lot about the subject. And he must have picked up a little of the greenery from his friend Zac Goldsmith. Anyway, he does it pretty well every week now and they don't get too far in the exchanges. \"Ming Campbell said: 'Isn't the lesson from the Iraq war that it's imperative when dealing with the crisis in Iran over its nuclear ambitions that we, every stage of the process, be explicit in having UN authority?' \"Mr Blair said they were going through the UN but had to send signals of strength. He added that we must stand firm in Iraq and not run away. Sir Menzies came back and said, what did Jack Straw mean when he said that Iran has now got its final warning? Because back in September he said an attack on Iran is, in quotes, inconceivable. And there were cries at the acting Lib Dem leader: 'What would you do?' Always a good question to a politician adopting a high moral posture.\" * This is an edited version of Michael White's full audio report, which is available in MP3 format.
