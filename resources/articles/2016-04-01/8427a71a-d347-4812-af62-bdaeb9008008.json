Provincials have noted this for years, but now there are signs that the shrugged \u201cwhat did you expect?\u201d patience is wearing thin. Just as it clearly has in Scotland. The Scots, whether formally separate or not, are going to insist on a new settlement. This is a difficult moment for BBC senior management. Facing a hostile government, it is being squeezed financially just as media globalisation and technical transformation challenge its traditional model. But this revolt of the provincial peasants will grow. The London aristocrats fawning at court could be in trouble. London is a centripetal force sucking the life out of the rest of Britain. For centuries, it has been dominant, as most capitals are, but until recently there were other capitals, proudly representing the other regions, with their own culture, political stance and achievements. People came to London to make their names or their fortunes, but most stayed, rooted in their own provincial world. Most still do, but the Londoncentric BBC does not recognise it. In fact, the BBC has known all this for years, hence Salford, but it is drawn into the vortex, even though it knows it cannot afford to ignore the rest of the country. Its response is tokenism. Policy won\u2019t change until attitudes change, from recruitment, to where creative people are based, to who is allowed on the air. We do have the occasional regional voice, in its Sunday best. But that\u2019s nothing new. I remember Wilfred Pickles and before him, JB Priestley. They were 70 or more years ago. There are wonderful characters all over the country, who would light up the screen with their unique take on life \u2013 but they\u2019re all over the country. They\u2019re not a short cab ride from BH. For years, the attitudes offered to us have been ones of metropolitan superiority. People in the provinces have appeared on screen patronised by posh southerners who occasionally venture north, like visiting anthropologists, to investigate the habits of the quaint natives. Their lives are editorialised by the southerners, filtered and interpreted. What current affairs programmes come from anywhere but central London? Oh, but if they came from Birmingham or Leeds, no one would watch them? Well, virtually no one watches Newsnight, but that doesn\u2019t stop it boring us with the usual metropolitan talking heads. Provincial stories are presented as though they were foreign news, often from a dangerous front line. People are allowed a vox pop word or two, for colour. This patronising guff is presented as serious news from the front. Well, the \u201cfront\u201d is our home country. Where are the films dramatising the living reality of working people, showing them in all their dignity, from their point of view? The BBC is not holding the mirror up to nature. Instead, it reflects distorted slivers of privileged life, for the international market; then it goes downmarket to caricature everyone else in soaps. New, commercially aggressive competitors are sweeping the world\u2019s small screens, just as the original Hollywood studios occupied the world\u2019s big screens. That market is important and I\u2019m glad to see the BBC play with the big boys: co-productions, big budgets, Hollywood production values and Swiss watch narrative structures. It needs to stay with the market leaders if it is to avoid losing its audience and its right to exist as an international player. But in drama, this high-gloss, genre production is broad stroke and draws on national stereotypes, missing the nuanced particulars of a culture. The gap cannot be filled by the repetitive riffs of soaps and series that are renewed because the format is familiar. This is drama as commodity: establish a brand and then refresh it in order to prolong its life. Why would you want to kill an established brand? Because you need to make room for original creativity. We are seeing not competitive energy, but the BBC corrupted by the values of commerce. It should be guided by the values of culture. We have a bleak drama landscape lacking in curiosity or active engagement, a drama of repetitive technique, the safety of familiar genre convention. Provincials are there as dressing in formula cops shows. The country is teeming with creative talent, aching to speak to us about its unique experience. No one seeks it out. When it pushes itself into view, it is apprenticed on a long runner and its original voice is ironed out. But drama that can compete on the international market is so expensive the BBC needs co-production investment. The long-running domestic series are also expensive, but they are holding an audience. This is no time to both alienate that audience and shoot holes in the schedule. So there\u2019s no room or money for your ideas. We are the realists. So goes the current management\u2019s thinking. My response is that this policy is fine if your policy is to turn the BBC into a commercial corporation. But it has a pre-eminent responsibility to swim against the tide, to reach out to everyone and engage in a truly national conversation. It still claims to educate, inform and entertain. To be a platform for the whole country. A stage for the exploration of our culture, culture in its richest sense. An institution everyone feels they own, one that represents them. It could yet become the catalyst for the whole nation\u2019s rediscovery of its cultural and economic wealth. Even that wasteland north of Watford. It would certainly remind Londoners that the peasants don\u2019t live in caves. Even though they talk funny. Tony Garnett\u2019s memoir, The Day The Music Died, is due to be published in June 2016"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
