The 72-year-old Juventus fan was speaking after he launched the Clerical Cup, a 16-squad tournament for priests and trainee priests in Rome. The cardinal had suggested Brazilian seminarists alone would be enough for a \"magnificent\" Vatican team, while African and Argentinian students are also reportedly in demand by priest-managers ahead of the Cup. A part-time football commentator during his days as archbishop of Genoa, the cardinal has now risen to become effective No 2 at the Vatican beneath the Pope. He is joined at the top of the Vatican first team by Portugal's Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, now prefect of the Causes of Saints and formerly a winger in Benfica's youth team. \"Even St Paul wrote about the value of sport,\" said Cardinal Fiorenzo Angelini, who works as a football commentator for Radio Vatican. As the Holy See lies outside Italian territory, Cardinal Bertone's god squad might find it hard to enter Italy's Serie A, and the Vatican has yet to join Fifa. If called upon, Cardinal Bertolene would prove a no-nonsense manager. The Pope has picked him to tackle criticisms of the Vatican in The Da Vinci Code. He is also a fierce opponent of abortion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
