Presumably his wife picked her husband in a secret ballot. Moments later, Dominic Raab followed him, the anger vein pumping overtime in his forehead. He was rushing on his steroid run. And he felt just like Jesus\u2019s son. Other MPs had their phones confiscated at the door. There had been rumours that Team Boris, led by Gavin Williamson, had instructed all their supporters to take a picture of their ballot paper with the X in the appropriate box. Trust is currently in short supply in the Tory party, and many MPs appear shell-shocked by the viciousness of the threats being made in private in the Commons tea rooms. More savvy MPs came ready with a burner phone. A WhatsApp photo message could be the difference between a ministerial career and the backbenches. Theresa May muttered a brusque: \u201cNone of your business\u201d when asked whom she had voted for, while Michael Gove declared he had voted for the best candidate. Which must be the first time a leadership contender has openly admitted he wouldn\u2019t be voting for himself. Boris Johnson, mouth clamped shut with gaffer tape, arrived with a minder whose sole job was to ensure his man said nothing to anyone. Mission accomplished. The less Johnson says in public, the more Tory MPs flock to support him. Of the contenders themselves, only Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart were ever-presents in the corridor. McVey and Leadsom kept their heads down, as if already resigned to their fate, while Stewart paced nervously. It soon became clear why. His big beast supporter, Ken Clarke, had gone awol and didn\u2019t have a phone. With just 15 minutes to go till voting closed, Clarke finally appeared. Stewart looked a relieved man. David Davis had been forced to make a second attempt at voting, the first having ended in failure when he couldn\u2019t produce any ID. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who you are, David,\u201d one of the tellers had said. He didn\u2019t seem that bothered and used the opportunity to audition for his one man standup show. How had the PM voted? \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. And I had a drink with her last night.\u201d Was he campaigning for Raab? Not when he had been having a drink with Theresa. Boom, boom. Don\u2019t call us. Only Raab and Stewart bothered to turn up in person for the result shortly after 1pm. The declaration was made by Cheryl Gillan, as the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, had recused himself to stand in the election, only to fail to secure enough supporters to even make it on the ballot. A man who gives hope to us all. He fails so we don\u2019t have to. Westminster\u2019s very own Prince Andrew. Then the spinning started. Team Boris said little and tried not to smirk. The margin of victory had exceeded even their own expectations. Williamson\u2019s strongarm tactics had paid dividends. Hard to imagine anyone being terrified by Private Pike, but there\u2019s no accounting for the vices and self-interest of Tory MPs. Sajid Javid\u2019s adviser insisted her man had finished \u201ca very strong fifth\u201d by picking up 23 votes. She didn\u2019t look best pleased when several journalists, myself included, started sniggering. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said crossly. \u201cAt one point he was in sixth place.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the strongest of sales pitches. Most of the rest took to Twitter to say how delighted they were to have secured so few votes. Mark Harper expressed surprise that anyone knew he existed \u2013 it was certainly news to him \u2013 while McVey was gobsmacked she had as many as nine backers. As was everyone else. Leadsom counted herself lucky she hadn\u2019t had any new #Rally4Leadsom T-shirts made. Maybe third time lucky. Matt Hancock also couldn\u2019t quite believe he had made such a strong showing with 20 votes. He had been expecting 19 and was so overwhelmed he appeared to be thinking of pulling out. Too much excitement can do that to you. Stewart was punching the air and sounding off to anyone who would listen. And when no one would, he just chatted to his phone. He had made it to the next round and was determined to enjoy every minute of his time in the sun. He tugged heavily on his opium pipe and revealed his alternative visions of the future. And what dreams. He was going to take Boris down. He was the man to beat. Despite finishing a strong seventh. If Boris chose to shut down parliament he would set up his own in Methodist Central Hall across the road. Shame it was already booked. Shame also that he had been so off his head the previous day that he had failed to back a Labour motion that tried to take no deal and prorogation off the table. Elsewhere Boris Johnson prepared for office. Sod Brexit. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do about that. Besides, there were so many other more important projects to consider first. A bridge to Ireland. A new royal yacht to keep his employers at the Telegraph happy. An honours list to die for. The bonfire of the vanities was fully ablaze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
