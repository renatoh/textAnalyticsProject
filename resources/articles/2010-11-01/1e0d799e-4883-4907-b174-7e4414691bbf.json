It's the beginning of a very interesting weekend indeed for Serie A, with second-placed Lazio taking on third-placed Napoli tomorrow lunchtime before first-placed Milan face fourth-placed Inter in the derby that evening. First up, though we have fifth-placed Juve against sixth-placed Roma. As far as storylines go, you couldn't wish for much more - Claudio Ranieri up against the team who sacked him last May, Alberto Aquilani taking on the team where he grew up, and two of Serie A's most celebrated forwards going head-to-head in Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero, though the latter will start tonight's game from the bench. But wait, as they say in those daytime TV ads for epic pen collections: there's more! In the centre of defence for Roma tonight will be Nicol\u00e1s Burdisso, and on the bench will be Marco Borriello - their top scorer this season. Juventus thought they had deals in place for both players in the summer, only for Roma to snatch them away from under their noses. Prowling the Old Lady's technical area (oo-er, missus, etc), meanwhile, is Luigi Del Neri - a man with whom Ranieri may feel he has a score to settle. Ranieri's last game in charge of Juventus was a 2-2 draw with Atalanta - then coached by Del Neri. Last season, the same manager was in charge of the Sampdoria team who ended Roma's 24-game unbeaten run, effectively denying them the title. Team news As anticipated, Borriello - despite being Roma's top scorer this season - drops to the bench, allowing Ranieri to start Totti together with Mirko Vucinic up front. Perhaps more intriguingly, though, Del Neri seems to be starting the 18-year-old Frederik Sorensen at left-back \u2013 a player who isn't even listed in the first-team squad on their website. Juventus: Storari, Sorensen, Bonucci, Chiellini, Grosso, Pepe, Melo, Aquilani, Marchisio, Iaquinta, Quagliarella. Subs: Costantino, Traore, Salihamidzic, Sissoko, Lanzafame, Del Piero, Amauri Roma: Julio Sergio, Cassetti, Mexes, Burdisso, Riise, Simplicio, De Rossi, Greco, Menez, Vucinic, Totti. Subs: Lobont, Cicinho, Castellini, Brighi, Baptista, Adriano, Borriello. Here's the sum of my knowledge on this Sorensen kid: ... OK, that's a slight exaggeration I know he is a defender, he's Danish, and he made his debut against Cesena at centre-back last weekend - though it seems more likely he'll play at right-back tonight. He was signed from Lyngby, and it seems his nickname may be Lake, though I don't know why. If there are any Lyngby fans out there with more information, let me know! Juventus fan and blogger ... Adam Digby informs me Sorensen is actually only on loan for now. 1 min Away we go. Roma in red, Juventus in shiny white away strip. Sorensen is at right-back by the way, not left-back. Before the first sixty-seconds are up, Menez picks up a booking for a late challenge on Burdisso. 2 mins From the free-kick about 10 yards into Roma's half the ball is looped over to the edge of the box, where Quagliarella flicks it over his marker but is unable to subsequently regain possession. 3 mins \"The nickname Lake - thats because his last name is S\u00f8rensen,\" explains Daniel Jantzen of our new favourite 18-year-old full-back. \"S\u00f8 means lake in Danish. He has never played for Lyngby's first team and he has 4 U/17 caps.\" 5 mins Roma look to get something going with a series of short passes in the centre of the park, but just as Cassetti began to bomb on down the right play was called back for a late challenge by Melo on Totti. The Brazilian becomes the second player to go into the book. 6 mins First shot of the game is from Simplicio, who scored against Fiorentina in mid-week but this time drags his shot a long way wide from 25 yards out. Roma enjoying the better of the opening exchanges. 7 mins What a chance that was for Juve! From out on the right touchline and with a defender in close attendance Quagliarella played an absolutely wonderful throughball for Iaquinta, only to watch his strike partner take a preposterously heavy first touch. By the time Iaquinta got back to the ball Julio Sergio was upon him and smothered his tight-angle effort. 9 mins What a classy player Quagliarella is - I'm not sure he's an easy one to deploy as a manager because he doesn't really score enough for a striker, but the boy has huge natural talent. Still wonder how Italy would have done had he started every game this summer at the World Cup. 11 mins And now a fine save from Storari to deny Menez! The Frenchman took a short pass from the left-flank and looked up before whipping a delicious, curling effort over towards the far corner which the keeper had to push behind at full-stretch. 12 mins Roma's corner comes to nothing. \"Frederik Sorensen is on a years loan at Juventus, with an option for them to buy him for around \u00a31m,\" writes Patrick Cullen.\"Originally they were only thinking about him for the youth team, but he's impressed and they've had injuries so he's figured in the last few games and done well. Very much not a household name here in Denmark yet, though ...\" 14 mins More good work from Roma on the edge of the box as Greco shows greater commitment than Melo to win a ball on the edge of the D and knock it to Riise, who flashes a thunderbolt just over the bar. 15 mins Lively game, so far, this. Both teams going for it and while Roma are having the better of it Juve look dangerous on the counter. 17 mins Oooh - a corner from the right for Roma looks to be arrowing its way right onto the head of an unmarked Burdisso in the middle of the area but he and De Rossi succeed only in getting in each others' way and the ball sails inches over both of their heads. It runs to Vucinic on the far side, but he takes a ragged touch as he tries to go past Sorensen and loses possession. 19 mins Roma win a free-kick 25 yards out which Totti clips over the wall to Vucinic. In what looks like a pre-planned routine he then tries to nod the ball down to Simplicio, who had timed a run in behind him, but the ball is cut out by a defender. 21 mins \"Regarding your photo caption, given the colour of the smoke I'm intrigued to know what they're smoking,\" parps Phil Sawyer. 23 mins Juve come streaming forwards on another break and Aquilani twirls a wonderful ball out to Pepe on the right. His cross is deflected behind for a corner ... 24 mins Oh my, how did no one get on the end of that? The corner was played short to Aquilani, who put as inviting a cross as you could imagine right across the six-yard box, yet not one of the three Juventus attackers who had managed to get behind their markers managed to get a toe on it. The ball runs out on the far side for a goal-kick. 26 mins Another heart-in-mouth moment for Roma fans, as Aquilani looks up in the centre of the park and humps a long pass forwards in the direction of Iaquinta. There's not a defender within five yards of the striker, but just when you think the flag is going to stay down it finally shoots up. The replay shows it was the right decision, Burdisso having timed his step forwards just right. 28 mins I'm guessing few Liverpool fans could stomach watching any more football this evening, but those who are might not like what they're seeing - Aquilani is at the heart of everything for Juventus going forwards. Another chip forwards from the midfielder looks to have set Quagliarella free down the left, but again the offside flag goes up. 29 mins Juve's turn to enjoy a bit more of the ball. Pepe knocks one up the pitch for Iaquinta to chase, but the ball runs through to the keeper before he can get to it. 31 mins Absolutely fantastic work down the right from Pepe - leaving Riise in his wake with a fluid swerve of the hips before hammering a wicked cross over the six-yard box. Julio Sergio reacts very smartly to punch the ball away with a Juventus attacker lurking just behind him. 33 mins Menez is enjoying a good spell of form at the moment and after his first attempted centre is blocked he dinks a second back for Riise to throw himself . The diving header from just behind the penalty spot lacks force and is blocked. GOAL! Juventus 1-0 Roma (Iaquinta 35 mins) What a very strange player Iaquinta is. Most of the time he looks like a workmanlike centre-forward, all muscle, bustle and heavy touches like the one that cost him the chance on 7 mins. Every now and then, though, he does something magnificent. When a cross came over from the right he didn't even take a touch, opting instead for a first-time scissor kick which fizzed straight past Julio Sergio and into the corner of the net. Glorious strike. 37 mins Well that suits Juve down to the ground. For the most part in this game already they were sitting back and soaking up pressure while looking to hit Roma on the break. 40 mins Iaquinta appeals for a free-kick as he tumbles on the edge of the area with Mexes's right arm wrapped around his midriff. Nothing doing for the referee. 41 mins Francesco Totti gets a sight of goal - the ball falling to him after Vucinic was denied inside the area, but he drags his shot a good way wide of the far post. 43 mins Menez really is providing most of the thrust for Roma going forwards, and he dances past two challenges on the edge of the area before Melo slides in to knock the ball behind for a corner ... 44 mins ... the corner is cleared but moments later the ball is back in the area at the feet of Mexes, who eludes Chiellini's sliding challenge before crashing to the ground seeking a penalty. Even after a few replays it's a tough one to call - looks like there may well have been some contact, but how much? 45 mins One minute of injury time on the way. 45 mins (+1) Roma win a free-kick very much within Francesco Totti range - about four yards outside the area on the right ... PENALTY TO ROMA! (45 mins +2) Vucinic rolled the free-kick to Totti, whose cannoned effort crashed off Pepe's outstretched arm and up into the evening sky. The referee points to the spot and it's a yellow card for Pepe. GOAL! Juventus 1-1 Roma (Totti, 45 mins +4) After lengthy discussion between players and officials the penalty is finally taken and Totti places it coolly into the bottom right corner. That's his first goal in the league since May. Peepety-Peeeeep! What a note that is to end the half on. Very enjoyable game - can't wait for the second half ... A different sport entirely \"After the game between Stoke and Liverpool, I am almost certain that I am now watching an entirely different sport,\" tootles John McLauchlin. Having not seen the Liverpool game myself, I'm going to make wildly prejudiced assumptions and assume that you mean that the one you are now watching is the more entertaining variety. What were they thinking dept. \"Letting Aquilani go on loan to Juve - Roy Hodgson's worst decision,\" posits an emailer going by the slightly odd moniker FF Si. \"Presume Juve will utilise their option to buy?\" I would be absolutely startled if they didn't - he's been getting better by the week. Juventus's shirt \"Why aren't Juve wearing stripes when they are playing at home,\" asks @_chrisjones_ on Twitter. I'm ashamed to say I don't know why they aren't wearing the stripes today, Chris, though I'd hazard a guess it's to do with sponsors. They have different sponsors (Balocco) on this shirt to the ones on the main home shirt (Betclic). This is nominally their second strip, though obviously being mostly white it can't be used in that many places where the black and white wouldn't work. 46 mins One half-time change for Juventus - Armand Traor\u00e9 coming on for Fabio Grosso - and also one for Roma - Aleandro Rosi replacing Cassetti. 47 mins Pepe comes thundering down the right flank with purpose but it looks as though he may need a few minutes to find his range again with his crosses - this one scuds straight into the nearest defender at ankle height. 49 mins Quagliarella, along with at least three team-mates, pull faces and gesticulate at the referee after the striker topples over following an aerial challenge with Rosi. Of course, if they had spent less time doing that, they might have noticed the fact the ball was loose and there for the taking. Play to the whistle now, lads. 50 mins Amauri and Del Piero are shown warming up together, though no signs of either coming on imminently. \"I wish someone other than Iaquinta had scored for Juve,\" wails Adrian C. \"That way, Del Neri would be much more likely to take him off for Del Piero. Iaquinta is useless 90% of the time.\" 51 mins Still a nice tempo to this game. Roma are pinging it about with abandon inside the Juventus half as I type. 52 mins Roma's latest attack ends with a hop, skip and a shot slapped straight into the upper tier from Vucinic. 53 mins Looks like I was wrong just now - Del Piero has taken off his training top and is coming on for Iaquinta. 55 mins Greco picks up a yellow card for a rather unnecessary tackle from behind on Bonucci. Borne out of frustration that one - the midfielder had just lost the ball cheaply and perhaps hasn't had the sort of impact on this game so far that he would have hoped for. 56 mins \"Aquilani - when fit - is one of the best playmakers in Europe,\" tweets @nevborg. \"Poulsen - when fit - is rubbish. As a Juve fan, thanks Roy!\" 57 mins Quagliarella rolls a short pass square to Pepe inside the area, and with his back to goal the winger looks to tee up Aquilani running in from deep. A Roma defender gets there first, though, so the midfielder's intended shot winds up only as a swipe through said opponent's ankle. Free-kick to Roma. 59 mins Menez has a shot charged down by Chiellini on the edge of the area. Still waiting for the first real chance of this half ... 61 mins Roma hoarding possession again in Juve's half but the home side are defending better than in the first period. Riise is released down the left but his cross is charged down almost before it leaves his boot. 62 mins A better cross from Pepe - more like what we were seeing in the first half - is arcing over towards Quagliarella, but Mexes gets up well to cut it out. The referee quickly whistles play dead as he thinks the two players have had a clash of heads, but it turns out Mexes was just getting up slowly because he's lazy. 64 mins Things get a little bit more ragged for a minute or two there - as Menez takes a short throw-in and bursts into the area down the right before rolling a square ball across the six-yard box. There's nobody running in for Roma, and Juventus break rapidly, rushing down the far end before Del Piero is dispossessed by a well-timed tackle from Rosi. 65 mins Another fine delivery from Pepe on the right finds Marchisio rushing in towards the far post, but he only succeeds in knocking it behind for a goal-kick. 66 mins \"Regarding the colour of smoke in your photo (see 21 mins), we'll see a similar picture next week from Anfield as Liverpool season tickets are incinerated,\" reckons Gary Naylor. 68 mins Totti is coming off for Roma, to be replaced by Borriello. You won't be surprised to hear that the captain looks pretty unimpressed at being this turn of events. He has little right to be, though - penalty aside his hasn't been an overwhelming contribution. 70 mins Free-kick for Roma in a dangerous spot in line with the penalty spot out on the left, but the cross is swung far too deep - flying behind Roma's front line before being cleared by Juve. 72 mins Best chance in a while for Juventus, as Pepe plays Quagliarella in with a slide-rule pass. The striker might have squared the ball for Del Piero, but instead took the chance on himself, and his low, rasping effort looked to be on target before it was blocked by a lunging defender. 75 mins Last substitution for Roma, with Brighi coming on to replace Greco. 76 mins Juventus throwing caution to the wind with their last change - midfielder Marchisio coming off with striker Amauri on in his place. 78 mins Chiellini goes down after a clash of heads with Vucinic, and will require treatment. In fact, it looks like Vucinic will as well now. 79 mins My - that's quite the new look Chiellini's getting - enormous cotton wool pads under layers and layers of bandage, all topped off with a very fetching hair net. Disappointed to say that the energy has slightly ebbed out of this game as the second half has worn on. Things have never quite returned to where they were in the first 45 minutes. 81 mins Felipe Melo checks back twice to make fools of first Simplicio then De Rossi as he shimmies into the Roma area down the right. He then rolls the ball back into the path of Aquilani, who thrashes a low shot towards the bottom corner, only for a Roma defender to again throw themselves in front of it at the last. 83 mins Menez has certainly faded in this game but he flickers to life again momentarily as he weaves his way down the right, only to put too much on his cross and see it run away from his team-mates away to the far side of the area. 85 mins Penalty appeals from the home crowd as Del Piero goes down sandwiched between Riise and De Rossi inside the area, but replays suggest their interventions were clean. Amauri then bundles Rosi over on the far side, giving away a free-kick. 87 mins What an effort that was from Quagliarella! Amauri flicked on a long ball forwards and without it touching the ground Del Piero flicked it back to Quagliarella nearly 30 yards out, from where his team-mate volleyed it first-time towards the top corner. Precisely the sort of strike that made him a YouTube phenomenon early in his career, but this time Julio Sergio was equal to it, diving fulll-stretch to push the shot away. 88 mins That would have been a goal of the season contender if it had gone in ... 90 mins Roma win a corner but Amauri heads it clear. Simplicio retrieves the loose ball, only to quickly lose it again. We'll have four minutes of injury time. 90 mins +1 Del Piero takes a pass down by the left-hand corner of Roma's six-yard box, but under pressure from a defender he takes a loose touch and the ball goes out for a goal-kick. Well Iaquinta could have done that ... 90 mins +2 An extremely curious miskick from Rosi on the edge of his own area almost wrong-foots his team's entire defence to release Amauri. Almost, but not quite. 90 mins +3 Juventus win a free-kick on the right, but Simplicio humps the cross straight back in for a throw-in. 90 mins (+4) One more free-kick for Juve - 25 yards out on the left. Before it can be taken, though, the referee is ordering Chiellini leave the field. Blood is streaming out from under his bandages, so you can see why. 90 mins (+5) Chiellini - presumably unwilling to miss this last free-kick, refuses to leave the field and instead sits down, insisting that he will only take treatment on the field. Just as at the end of the first-half, players from both teams are now surrounding the referee to have their say. 90 mins (+6) Chiellini finally receives his treatment but is then made to leave the pitch anyway, and the referee will not let him back on before the free-kick is taken. No matter really - Del Piero hammers the set piece straight into the wall. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! That's it - full-time in Turin and a draw that is probably, on balance, the right result. Both teams had chances in a very entertaining first half, and though it petered out a bit in the second, there were still chances - not least that thunderous volley from Quagliarella.
