How the legacy of slavery endures in Tunisia", "bodyText": "Many within Tunisia greeted the news that 81-year-old Hamden Dali had won his two decade-long campaign to have \u201catig\u201d removed from his name with little more than bemusement. But for Dali atig \u2013 meaning \u201cliberated by\u201d \u2013 in his name was a painful reminder of his family\u2019s heritage as former slaves. Dali, who lives on the island of Djerba, does not have a telephone. However, his lawyer, Hanen Ben Hassana, from the mainland city of Sfax, was clear: \u201cYou have to think of what could possibly make an 80-year-old man insist on pursuing his case despite all the hardships, including the spread of the virus,\u201d she says. \u201cJust think of that. Then you\u2019ll realise the kind of history he\u2019s been carrying on his back for a great part of his life.\u201d Tunisia was the first Arab country to abolish slavery, outlawing the practice in 1846, 19 years before the US. However, though the initial edict was quickly adopted in the urban north, it was some time before slavery was abolished entirely, with a further proclamation required in 1890. Today, between 10 and 15% of Tunisians are black, many descended from slaves. What few can dispute is the relative lack of black Tunisians in politics or the media. According to a 2018 Afrobarometer survey, black Tunisians reported a variety of disadvantages, the most important of which was unemployment, at about 42%, compared with 25% nationally. The exact number of slaves within Tunisia, of both African and European origin, was estimated in the 1960s as having been as low as 7,000 in 1861 while more recent accounts put the figure closer to 167,000. Though the practice may have been abolished for more than a century, its legacy lives on. In the ancient medina in Tunis, the old slave market still stands, although today its stalls sell gold and silver rather than human beings. In Tunisia\u2019s south, the village of El Gosbah stands divided by a river, separating the settlements of the descendants of black slaves from their white neighbours. In language, slavery\u2019s legacy thrives, with surnames such as Abid and Shoushan, both denoting slave, commonplace. In Bardo, a suburb of Tunis, Saadia Mosbah relaxes in the makeshift headquarters of her anti-racism association, Mnemty (my dream). \u201cEveryone speaks of the transatlantic slave routes, but no one really speaks of the trans-Saharan slave routes from areas around Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Gambia,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we spoken of these? Principally because it was Arabs and Muslims who enslaved, which makes people reluctant to talk about them.\u201d For Mosbah, a lack of education coupled with an unwillingness to address their complicity in the slave trade, are among the drivers of racism. \u201cTunisians don\u2019t really know this. It isn\u2019t taught in schools. It isn\u2019t in the history books. It\u2019s a case of amnesia,\u201d she says. \u201cIf more people knew about it, it might limit the racism and lessen the pain people feel. For example, once someone knows the history of the blacks and the slaves, they\u2019ll understand that they were brought here to be part of the workforce, until machinery eventually forced them out.\u201d In 2018, Tunisia passed a landmark law, essentially criminalising racial discrimination, which was pivotal in Hamden Dali shedding his unwanted label. But a lack of funds \u2013 a perennial issue in Tunisian politics \u2013 has limited any campaign to raise awareness of the law, leaving that task to groups such as Mnemty. However, the law is up against decades of disadvantage. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for black people to get professional jobs,\u201d Mosbah says. \u201cNot because of any law, but because we grow up under different conditions.\u201d While slavery\u2019s poisonous legacy continues to be debated around the world, there is at least some evidence that Tunisian authorities are keen to address the past. But the prejudice that underpinned it remains an everyday part of life for black Tunisians and those who travel to the country from across Africa to study. Helping out in the Mnemty offices is 23-year-old Bilel (not his real name). Bilel came to Tunisia from Ivory Coast to study engineering, but has been racially harassed, both officially and socially, since his arrival. Clearly uncomfortable, he says: \u201cI never imagined that things would be this way or that I would encounter racism in an African country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
