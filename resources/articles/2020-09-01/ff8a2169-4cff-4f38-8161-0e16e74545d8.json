It portrayed Nico as rather more of a rock\u2019n\u2019roller than she actually was, which is fair enough \u2013 but Nicchiarelli sticks her neck out considerably further doing the same with Eleanor Marx in Miss Marx, her competition entry on the Lido this year. It\u2019s unlikely that this tragic-fated socialist pioneer, the daughter of Karl Marx, ever enjoyed a punk-rock freakout after hitting the opium pipe, but that\u2019s what happens here. Romola Garai going full Courtney Love makes for one of the film\u2019s livelier tilts against biopic proprieties. Eleanor is introduced in the film with flashing credits and a thunderous blast from US neo-punk band Downtown Boys \u2013 \u201criding in on a wave... a wave of history.\u201d But what follows is mostly in a familiar mode of heritage solemnity. Garai plays Eleanor, first seen giving a eulogy to her late parents, before meeting the man she would live with, playwright Edward Aveling (Patrick Kennedy). After a brief discussion of the poet Shelley as a socialist, they\u2019re in each other\u2019s arms, and he\u2019s joining her for a trip across the Atlantic (where they learn that even cowboys were exploited by their bosses), and a whirlwind montage of black-and-white archive footage of the US. An ominous note is sounded on their return, as questions are raised over the expenses for their trip, especially Edward\u2019s floral bouquets for his beloved. What the film does well is to capture the domestic reality of Victorian life among the socialists, whether it\u2019s an opium evening among bohemian friends or catching up \u2013 although there\u2019s a lot of somewhat cluttered exposition among them, explaining to us which Marx daughter is which, and the complicated household arrangements of Friedrich Engels. He\u2019s played by John Gordon Sinclair, who was funny and touching as Nico\u2019s besotted, long-suffering manager in Nicchiarelli\u2019s last film, and who exudes avuncular warmth from behind a long beard. Given the opening, it\u2019s surprising just how straight and sober Nicchiarelli plays it for the most part, offering a grave, somewhat theatrical (but only occasionally stilted) account of this milieu. Apart from the odd factory visit, this is largely a drawing room film, with claustrophobic interiors, and lovingly artificed chiaroscuro by cinematographer Crystel Fournier, known for her work with C\u00e9line Sciamma. Beyond those intermittent blasts of punk, and the odd to-camera declaration from Garai, Nicchiarelli only pulls one major trick, but it\u2019s a good one. This is a scene in which Eleanor candidly tells Edward that she\u2019s tired of being oppressed by him, as she was by her father; we then realise that they are actually performing a scene from Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House (which Eleanor translated, as she did Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary). Even so, the passage speaks eloquently about the realities of their relationship, and Garai and Kennedy pull it off with artful grace. It comes as no surprise that, ultimately, it\u2019s Garai\u2019s performance that makes the film so watchable. She has plenty of form in costume drama, from her turn in 2002\u2019s BBC Daniel Deronda to her relishably nutty Edwardian novelist in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s 2007 Angel; if anyone has the wherewithal to play history with absolute naturalness, it\u2019s her. She pulls off a performance here that is reserved, unshowy but absolutely affecting, conveying a sense of Eleanor Marx the political thinker as well as the suffering modern woman, aware of the terms of her social imprisonment but unable to break free. Patrick Kennedy makes the most of a potentially thankless role as the charming but feckless Edward, and Karina Fernandez, a long-serving Mike Leigh regular, offers brisk support as South African writer Olive Schreiner. It\u2019s disappointing that Miss Marx doesn\u2019t turn out as full-tilt provocative as the opening promises. In the end, it\u2019s the sort of creditable, studious film that audiences are most likely to encounter at festivals, and then with faint reluctance.It\u2019s watchable, stately, sometimes ludicrous and \u2013 in sporadic doses \u2013 audacious. Revolutionary, however, it isn\u2019t."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
