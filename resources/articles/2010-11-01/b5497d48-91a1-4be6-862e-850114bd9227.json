Don't read ahead if you haven't seen episode six yet \u2013 and if you have seen later episodes please remember that UK viewers may not have. Paul MacInnes's episode five blog A cathedral is an ongoing legacy of our feeble efforts to touch god. It is a continuum of creation, beautiful work that \u2013 pray god \u2013 will never end.\" \u2013 Prior Philip The final shot of The Pillars of the Earth is of Kingsbridge cathedral. Quite right too, the building being the star of this expensive but otherwise curiously unlavish drama. The twist is that the image, shot from the sky is of the cathedral in the modern day. I suppose it's there to show the cathedral's longevity, the proof of Philip's words. Sadly, I could only look at its spire looming over the poxy town around it and think: \"I bet that plays hell with the traffic.\" It's difficult to afford a big church the same sense of wonder in the 21st century that a load of monks and halfwit pilgrims appear to have done in the 12th. Old man Philip hopes the cathedral's development might never end. It's quite likely that the most momentous event in the cathedral's last 100 years was the introduction of central heating. In the end, though, The Pillars of the Earth did articulate how a cathedral could not only matter politically and financially to people, but animate them spiritually as well. From its construction, doing God's work, to its purpose, to induce a sense of awe and beauty, the point of the big stone lunk became clear. Anyway, enough of the church, on to the action. A double final episode meant that the betrayals, the deaths and the speed-reading of Euclid came thick and fast. Most unexpected was William asphyxiating his mama lover. With a doll he'd nicked from his supposed child bride. Oh, the psychology! Most delightful, however, were Waleran's final moments. With flashbacks to the curse he received upon sentencing Jack Cherbourg to death \u2013 \"you shall climb high then fall to the ground\" \u2013 Waleran climbs to the roof of the cathedral and falls from it. He hangs on to a gargoyle that looks like Jack's dad and it starts to sing like him in the fire. Waleran decides it's better to go out showing his true colours and lets go rather than accept Jack's outstretched hand. When he hits the ground, still in one piece, he spits blood in the consoling face of Prior Philip. He turns his head to the crowd as if to say, \"Pretty funny, huh?\" and then expires. That's a villain's death. Jack, gravel-voiced, autodidact Jack, well everything goes brilliantly for him. He's got his wife, his kid and his cathedral, and with his final declamation against Waleran he finds a hero's voice too. Aliena and Richard turn out well too \u2013 must be something to do with them being true, upstanding people (when they're not beheading saracens at Stephen's orders). Poor old Alfred, meanwhile . . . actually forget 'poor old' \u2013 if anyone deserved to be poisoned in the mimsiest knife fight ever then it was surely Alfred the inept. Pillars always ran along at a fine pace with a barely credible plot but an eye for decent set pieces and, so it proved ultimately, well-rounded characters. Philip, of all, went through the most delicate of transformations, from a naif to a ditherer to a politician and, finally, a humble servant of God as he had always hoped to be. He even looks good in 1170, as he finally consecrates the cathedral. Well apart from the jowls, but I'm sure some entrepreneur in Kingsbridge will soon invent plastic surgery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
