Erica, Box Hill, Surrey It depends mainly on whether you want to keep your fingers attached to your hands, Erica. Chef Mark Birchall, whose restaurant Moor Hall near Ormskirk in Lancashire was last week voted the UK\u2019s best at the annual National Restaurant Awards, likens his knives to a toolkit: \u201cNo one reaches in and picks out the same screwdriver for every DIY job, do they?\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cYou just can\u2019t fillet a fish with the same knife you use to chop parsley.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go to town on the knife collection, Birchall says. \u201cYou need a short, stiff knife [AKA a chef\u2019s knife] for general everyday stuff, from chopping veg to trimming a rack of lamb, for example. A long, flexible blade for boning meat and filleting or skinning fish. And a serrated one for bread.\u201d If you want to push the boat out, \u201ca paring knife is handy for prep and peeling, but it\u2019s not essential\u201d, he adds. The big drawback is cost \u2013 Birchall favours US brand Mac (from about \u00a390 for a basic chef\u2019s knife), Japanese Missono (\u00a3150-plus) or a reliable German marque such as W\u00fcsthof or Henckels (\u00a380-100) \u2013 but he reckons a comparatively cheap Victorinox (from about \u00a324) will do the job just as well: \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many chefs use those day-to-day.\u201d He says that the type and brand is less important than a knife that\u2019s properly sharp and feels comfortable in the hand \u2013 and that applies to a domestic kitchen as much as to a professional one. \u201cYou\u2019re far more likely to slip and injure yourself with a blunt knife than a scarily sharp one.\u201d As for comfort, that\u2019s more personal preference: \u201cI don\u2019t like a chef\u2019s knife that\u2019s too light, especially if I\u2019m stood there chopping for hours at a time. You end up gripping it too tightly and end up with terrible hand-ache.\u201d Some of the cooks in Birchall\u2019s kitchen keep 10 or more blades in their knife rolls: \u201cChefs can get a bit obsessive about them,\u201d he laughs, \u201cbut most only ever use those three main types, no matter how many they own. A lot of it\u2019s just willy-waving.\u201d Talking of knife spods, food writer Tim Hayward has penned an entire book on the subject, called Knife \u2013 well, obviously (the paperback edition came out at the end of last month). It\u2019s a love letter to the kitchen knife in general and to his own extensive collection especially. Hayward has a particular soft spot for Japanese knives, on both aesthetic and practical grounds. \u201cThey have this special vegetable knife, an usuba, a sort of long, narrow chopper,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the way they traditionally cut veg, there\u2019s no need for a sharp point. They also have dedicated knives for fish [deba and yanagiba] and meat, the gyuto or \u2018cow blade\u2019.\u201d But even Hayward, who runs Cambridge bakery Fitzbillies as a sideline to the day job, agrees that there\u2019s no need to go overboard: \u201cIf you want to take the skin off fish fillets, it\u2019s a good idea to have a knife with a flexible blade, and if you\u2019re cutting through bone or cartilage in meat, you\u2019ll need a cleaver, but with those two exceptions, for a western cook, a decent 8in or 10in chef\u2019s knife will do just about everything else.\u201d And anyway, the notion of combining knife styles in a single blade is catching on even in Japan: \u201cThey now make a knife called a santoku, which means \u2018three strengths\u2019,\u201d Hayward says. \u201cIt looks much like a western chef\u2019s knife and is considered suitable for all three food types: veg, fish and meat.\u201d He won\u2019t reveal how many blades he owns, but it possibly rivals John Lewis\u2019 kitchen department. And, at the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you (and your budget) whether you choose to hop down that particular rabbit hole. \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
