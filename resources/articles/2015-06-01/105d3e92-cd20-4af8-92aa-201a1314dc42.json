That kind of agility is foreign to the way governments operate, says Quintan Wiktorowicz, a former adviser on countering violent extremism (CVE) to president Barack Obama. Bringing the dynamism of Isis \u2013 what he calls \u201cthe ultimate startup\u201d \u2013 to the fight against the militant group is the goal of Hackabout, an event Wiktorowicz is helping to run on the sidelines of this week\u2019s regional CVE summit in Sydney. Inside the spacious event room, decked out in coloured chairs and beanbags, young people are chatting animatedly and gesticulating into screens. Scribbled on butcher\u2019s paper are phrases such as \u201cTinder for mentorship\u201d, \u201cIsis bloopers\u201d and \u201cdodge-a-recruiter\u201d; the wisps of ideas vying to win funding and be turned into a full-blown app or digital campaign. That entrepreneurship can help fight violent extremism sounds like the wooly optimism typical of Silicon Valley, but Wiktorowicz is convinced. \u201cVery simplified, radicalisation is the combination of anger and disempowerment,\u201d he says. \u201cEntrepreneurship is the ultimate narrative of empowerment.\u201d Digital artist Kathryn B (not her real name) is one of the 60 participants, just back from presenting her idea to the US State Department. Along with a team of other Curtin University students she developed 52 Jumaa, an app aimed at \u201cgiving young Muslims an opportunity to create social change\u201d, she says. Users choose qualities they want to develop, such as patience or courage, and are given challenges \u2013 get involved in youth work, make your mum a cup of tea \u2013 to help them along. ConnectMe is one app Yassmin Abdel Magied and her team are scrambling to develop. As she sees it, extremism comes from a sense of powerlessness. \u201cIsis finds those people, creates a personal connection and says: \u2018Here\u2019s how we can empower you\u2019,\u201d she says. The app, initially aimed at Muslims but open to all, would connect young people with engineers, coaches, writers \u2013 whichever kind of mentor they ask for. \u201cIt\u2019s about connecting people with others outside their immediate circles,\u201d she says. An earlier \u201chaqqathon\u201d in Abu Dhabi \u2013 playing off \u201chaqq\u201d, the Arabic word for truth \u2013 produced a website called Marhubba, a place for young Muslims to learn what the Qur\u2019an teaches about sex and relationships in countries where sex education is frowned on and families are reluctant to broach the topic. Most valuable, Wiktorowicz says, are the networks built between participants in similar hackathons around the world. He\u2019s worked on four in the past five months. \u201cThat\u2019s 250 to 360 talented Muslims globally connected to each other,\u201d he says. Participants in Hackabout will make their pitches on Friday, the winning idea to be adopted and funded by Wiktorowicz\u2019s \u201cincubator\u201d, Affinis Labs. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019 to remove some personal details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
