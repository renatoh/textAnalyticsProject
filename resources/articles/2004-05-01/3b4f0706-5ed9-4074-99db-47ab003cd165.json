The two-year training programme gives her an opportunity to spend six months in the four core areas - health and safety, employee policy and relations, customer service and organisational development. She has just ended a six-month stint in customer service and is now on a major project, Making The Connections. \"As part of the project, I helped organise a leadership conference which was a steep, but exciting learning curve,\" she says. Working in HR has given her a chance to learn \"a lot about the different aspects of Scottish Water and its achievements since it was established two years ago\". But she hasn't always been so enthusiastic. After graduating from Loughborough University she went into marketing with a travel company in London. It was a \"good experience\", but she realised quite quickly that she wasn't suited to marketing. She recalls: \"I thought it was going to be a bit more glamorous.\" After a year she left without a job and ended up temping as an administrator in the HR department of an IT company in south London. Within six months she was an HR administrator. She was offered the post of HR assistant and did a postgraduate course in HR management, sponsored by the company. \"Working in a small team, I dealt with everything HR related. It was brilliant.\" Kathryn, who is originally from Scotland, is thrilled that a career she fell into by accident has turned out to be ideal. Her advice to recent graduates looking for their niche? \"Don't be too proud to start at the bottom and work your way up. Dealing with small issues gives a better understanding of how the big things work.\" \u00b7adeline@worksmart communications.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
