He lies spread-eagle, hands and feet cuffed to the bed, a chain slung between his nipple rings. He is naked aside from a black leather G-string and a black hood, leaving only a moist mouth visible. At this swanky five-star hotel, \u201cDom\u201d introduces us to his business: a sex counselling service for the \u201cadventurous\u201d. Gyrating to Ian Dury\u2019s Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick, he asks to be spanked. Cautiously, one girl tickles him with a red feather boa; another sprays him with whipped cream; ice is shoved where the sun don\u2019t shine. (No one touches the rolling pin.) Then Dom introduces a giant rubber dildo. Tied Up/Tidy Up, performed by Sam Foster \u2013 co-founder of the Gold Coast\u2019s Shock Therapy Productions \u2013 was just one piece in Hotelling, an arts event held last weekend at the QT Gold Coast. Art in a hotel? I\u2019m sceptical. But Foster\u2019s comedy vignette deliciously mixes the mundane and the naughty. At one point Dom gasps as his bottom is whipped; at another he hands out business cards and pauses apologetically to switch off calendar reminders on his iPhone. Hotelling is the brainchild of artist and curator David Pledger, funded by City of Gold Coast and produced by Bleached Arts and QT. For the main event, Down the Rabbit Hole, 160 visitors paid $50 to immerse themselves in a three-hour evening of soundscapes, performance art and digital wizardry. In the vein of the wildly popular Secret Cinema and the trend for immersive, site-specific theatre, spectators become participants. Lacking cool warehouses or historic buildings, Pledger has turned to the myriad high-rise hotels of Surfers Paradise. \u201cIt\u2019s often seen as a negative,\u201d says Pledger, \u201cBut these hotels are like the Melbourne laneways were 25 years ago. The potential in them is massive.\u201d To Pledger each hotel is a playground or \u201cmini city\u201d. Life inside the revolving doors is a life exaggerated: sex, grief, transition are all amplified. In Hotelling the canvas is the hotel itself. The pool, the tennis court and even a giant bathtub (replete with froth and a bloody scene using lashings of ketchup) become a stage. Our evening begins on the dizzying 22nd floor with glitzy Eurovision-style host Slavka (Nadia Sunde), who eases the audience up with instructions to get \u201cloosey goosey\u201d. After booze and a group hip wiggle dance (part of Hotelling\u2019s charm is that it not afraid to be silly), we are whisked across the hotel. Holding together the disparate works is the search for a lost bunny. Everyone is looking for \u201cMonty\u201d. There\u2019s a girl in white knee-high boots and a 60s minidress peering under hotel doors; a grown woman in pink rabbit pyjamas and fluffy rabbit-shaped slippers forlornly asking hotel guests to find her pet; and, appearing like a mirage down the corridor, a surreal figure in a rabbit mask and slick white suit. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we putting art in these incredible landscapes?\u201d asks Louise Bezzina, director of Gold Coast arts and culture event Bleach festival. Bezzina, like Pledger, does not see commerciality in a hotel; she sees theatrical possibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s a real milestone for the Gold Coast \u2013 a city that is so fun, sexual, touristy, exciting,\u201d adds Bezzina. \u201cMuch of the program at Bleach is about being accessible, bringing [art] to the place of holiday.\u201d The elephant in the room remains: how do you make Hotelling authentic, rather than simply a branding exercise or PR stunt? How do you avoid buying into just another aspect of the in vogue, but often empty, fad of the \u201cart mall\u201d or \u201cart hotel\u201d? \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge,\u201d admits Bezzina. Pledger, for one, does not believe that the corporate nature of the space \u201cis any different from a theatre or arts centre. In some ways you\u2019re less compromised, because the arts are basically governed by boards that are risk-averse and extremely conservative and are only ever about income streams.\u201d Part of the fun \u2013 and tension \u2013 in Hotelling comes from pouncing on the unsuspecting general public. How will the average hotel guest react to a giant, creepy bunny prowling their corridor? Playing on ideas of truth and representation, one performance piece features an affected pink-haired surveillance artist (Hayden Jones) as a peeping Tom, who asks the audience to join him in spying on a tower block across the way. Acclaimed burlesque artist Moira Finucane, too, raises the bar. On the tennis court as the Queen of Hearts (first performed in a London club in 2003), Fiuncane pops red balloons in red lingerie \u2013 the bra and crotch decked in a cluster of sharp spikes \u2013 her red-raw makeup smudged, stamping her red heels. In the grand finale, Dark and Gothic, she turns the Penthouse into a fairytale world of betrayed lovers. Sporting grossly elongated fingers \u2013 so pointed they are like 10 knives \u2013 and a backless ballgown, she reminds me of a gorgeous, grotesque Roald Dahl character. Pledger eventually has plans to \u201cinsert art into a hundred hotels\u201d on the Gold Coast. This is just the beginning. And standing in room 306, I hope there is more. For all the fun of the performances, this one \u2013 the simplest \u2013 affects me the most. In The Crying Man, a businessman (the heartbreaking Todd MacDonald) orders room service. It\u2019s his son\u2019s fifth birthday and he wants to toast him. As we watch him on the phone to his wife, though, cracks in his marriage begin to surface. He travels too much, his relationship is stagnant, he worries she is having an affair. He is just a man, in a hotel, far away from his family, popping champagne and crying into the bubbles. \u2022 The Guardian was a guest of Bleached Arts and QT Gold Coast"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
