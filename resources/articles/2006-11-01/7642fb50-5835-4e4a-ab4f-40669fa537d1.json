It also warns there is a risk that higher taxes may be needed given the worsening state of Britain's public finances. Last week the Bank's monetary policy committee lifted the cost of borrowing by 0.25% to 5%, and it is widely believed another similar increase could be on the cards early next year, perhaps in February. But David Kern, economic adviser to the BCC, said there was no justification for further rises. He said the recent upturn in inflation was largely temporary and would fall back as personal disposable income was being squeezed, the global economy was weakening and oil prices had begun to fall back. \"The arguments for the small November increase in rates were finely balanced and were not as conclusive as the clamour in some quarters for a rise might have indicated. There is certainly no case for a further increase.\" The BCC says the squeeze on disposable incomes, worsening global prospects and higher rates will help slow growth in 2007 to 2.3% after reaching 2.6% this year. It had been expecting 2.4% growth next year. Mr Kern said: \"Our new forecast assumes that [interest rates] will stay at 5% until the middle of 2007 and then decline back to 4.75% in reaction to slowing economic growth. But if the base rate is raised to 5.25-5.5%, the negative implications for the UK economy would be very serious.\" The BCC is also concerned about productivity, one of the targets for improvement of the chancellor, Gordon Brown. \"UK productivity is mediocre by international standards and is lower than that of the other G7 members taken as a group. The improvement in our relative productivity position seen up to 2002 has not been sustained. On some measures, our relative position has worsened.\" He said public finances had improved early this year but the position had worsened since then, with most analysts believing the medium-term outlook had deteriorated. This could mean higher taxes to help reduce debt levels, which was bound to threaten business confidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
