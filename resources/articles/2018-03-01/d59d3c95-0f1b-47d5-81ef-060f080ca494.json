You might think this reverse labelling unhelpful, but it is an effective way to shift perspective \u2013 to counter the sense of superiority that comes of thinking yourself normal, and to be obliged to own a term that seems reductive and exclusionary. While the label \u201cneurotypical\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to address the many and varied things that are wrong with me, it is still nice to have a diagnosis. Are You Autistic? (Channel 4) sought to overturn preconceptions about the condition (not illness). Autism manifests itself across a spectrum, but that spectrum is not a straight line \u2013 there are any number of interconnected traits leading to varying degrees of difficulty with social interaction, organisation and sensory perception. Those with autism are not just a load of awkward people with a \u201csuperpower that they bring out at parties\u201d. Ably and amiably presented by trainee human rights lawyer Georgia Harper and artist Sam Ahern, both of whom are autistic, and deploying Anna Richardson as a sort of neurotypical ambassador, the programme was underpinned by a new online study. The question in the title hinted at the programme\u2019s main proposition \u2013 backed up by the study \u2013 that autism is a vastly under-diagnosed condition. Until recently, it was thought the prevalence of autism was four times higher among men than women, but it now seems autistic women are just better at camouflaging it. And while the diagnosis of children has improved, it is likely that there is a \u201clost generation\u201d of adults who don\u2019t know they are autistic. The programme held out the possibility of a diagnosis for two people \u2013 JP and Jo, both in their 30s \u2013 who have long suspected they are somewhere on the spectrum. While this would not seem obvious to anyone meeting either of them for the first time, certain traits emerged in interviews and testing. JP is hypersensitive to noise \u2013 he and Jo outperformed neurotypicals in a ridiculously difficult hearing test \u2013 and they each struggled when presented with staged scenarios in which actors said things they didn\u2019t mean. Neither seemed to have much sense of the psychological gears grinding away in the heads of others. Then again, you could blame the acting. Are You Autistic? constituted a fairly basic primer, but it was undoubtedly one the public sorely needs. Even if it sought to cater for an audience with zero knowledge or experience of autism \u2013 including people who might have it and don\u2019t know it \u2013 the programme probably told most viewers something they didn\u2019t already know. Particularly fascinating was the extent to which \u201csocial masking\u201d may be behind the under-diagnosis of women with autism. Because women are better trained to fake sociability \u2013 laughing at jokes they don\u2019t find funny, making an effort with eye contact, rehearsing social interaction ahead of time \u2013 the condition can be missed. In one, admittedly anecdotal, experiment a group of young autistic women went speed-dating with neurotypical men, none of whom noticed anything. Of course, this may have something to do with the average twentysomething neurotypical male\u2019s ability to talk about himself endlessly. More poignant, was the revelation of the struggle this social masking involves. Several of the women said they would probably later have a meltdown in a darkened room as a result of the stress brought about by the experiment. Jo and JP were finally sent for diagnostic interviews with the autism expert Dr Simon Baron-Cohen \u2013 \u201cas much as a neurotypical can be an expert on autism,\u201d said Harper. The \u201creveal\u201d of the diagnosis was kept off camera. Only afterwards did we discover that JP was indeed autistic, and Jo was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Both seemed immensely relieved; it was especially important to JP, whose nine-year-old son is also autistic. The programme\u2019s online questionnaire \u2013 the largest study of its kind \u2013 found 87,000 people out of 750,000 participants reached or passed the diagnostic cutoff for autism. If nothing else, this is well above the accepted statistic that autism affects 1% of the UK population. Above all, Are You Autistic? was a plea for understanding. Actually, it was more than that: with its upfront, playful and sometimes spiky approach, it amounted to a persuasive insistence on understanding.
