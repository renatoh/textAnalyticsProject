Testing the new Tom Tom Navigator on a drive from London to Herefordshire turned out to be an experience of two halves. Going down it worked very well with the aid of only a Pocket PC and the Tom Tom GPS (global positioning system) device hanging from the windscreen by a suction disc. All you do is type in the road you are departing from and the road or village you want to go to. A small arrow on the screen map tells you exactly where you are and you can follow your car down roads and across roundabouts. It even marks tracks as well as secondary roads. It guided us successfully out of London on to to the M4, except when I misguidedly added instructions to get us to the nearest pizza restaurant, which it kept trying to do along the motorway until I found the way to change the instruction (my fault). There was a short period when we got no reception between the London map and the Birmingham one, as there wasn't enough memory in the Pocket PC to load the complete map of Britain. Navigation is possible in two ways. A passenger can look at the map and monitor exactly where you are to within a few metres and the exact speed - as long as you are in contact with the requisite number of satellites. Or, if you are driving, you can simply switch on the voice function, which gives precise instructions. We arrived at our destination having discovered from the map the existence of a river close to a road we thought we knew well but which couldn't be seen from the car. I was beginning to become hooked. Coming back was a disappointment, as it only rarely picked up satellite signals. When we got to London, it didn't seem able to pick up signals. However, the next day, it was picking up signals in London as if nothing had happened. The Navigator costs \u00a3289.95 (excluding the Pocket PC) and is now available from Carphone Warehouse and 02 shops. Discounted prices are available from www.clove.co.uk . Or, you can buy instead an XDA pocket PC with Navigator bundled in for \u00a3499. The Navigator is a bit more expensive than such rival products as Navman (\u00a3215 to \u00a3250) because, the company claims, it has superior mapping technology and voice prompts. Downloads that include the location of speed cameras, football clubs, stations and hotels are available. It is really a device for early adopters, but it also gives an early taste of the usefulness of location-based phones that will be coming on to the market in increasing numbers during the next few years. And prices will, of course, continue to drop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
