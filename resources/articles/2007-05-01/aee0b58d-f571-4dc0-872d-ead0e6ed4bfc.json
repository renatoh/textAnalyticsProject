Indeed, this look at \"London's history hotspot\", from the installation of new exhibitions to a jaunt around the oldest surviving part of the museum, goes out of its way to emphasise its non-threatening, unstuffy credentials. To top it all, there's narration from Ian McMillan, a Yorkshire poet. Paul Copley, we can only assume, was busy. Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final 8pm, BBC3 Paddy O'Connell and Sarah Cawood host this prelim, the theme of which is Finland: A Country of Contrasts. A whopping 28 countries will compete here and, blessedly, only the top 10 will qualify for the final on Saturday. Vying to compete with the Royaume Uni's own Scooch, screeching Flying the Flag (For You), are Switzerland's DJ Bobo with Vampires Are Alive, Poland's the Jet Set proclaiming Time to Party and Turkey's Kenan Dogulu imploring Shake It Up, Sekerim. Saddam's Tribe 9pm, Channel 4 Based mainly on the testimony of Saddam's daughter, Raghad, this drama is a compelling exploration not just of the bloody and brutal workings of Saddam's government of Iraq but also of the indomitability of denial and the corrosive consequences of power, chief among them the fear of losing it. Taking the conceit of the unreliable narrator to a whole new level, Raghad, played admirably by Michelle Bonnard, relays her father's love of parties, of his children, of the Iraqi people, as the tortured country starves, burns and weeps. There's also an impressive array of stick-on moustaches. Hitler: The Comedy Years 11.05pm, Channel 4 It must be Dictator Night on Channel 4. While Saddam gets the dramatic treatment, Jacques Peretti explores how the least comedic person ever became a figure of fun. From wartime derision, in film and in song, to his impact on comedy ever since, here's a fitting romp featuring the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Freddie Starr, Basil Fawlty and the cast of 'Allo 'Allo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
