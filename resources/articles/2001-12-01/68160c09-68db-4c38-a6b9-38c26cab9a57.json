Rugby Partnership Wales, a joint venture company made up of Llanelli, Swansea, Cardiff, Newport, Bridgend and Pontypridd, said the Welsh game was facing meltdown with clubs having to survive on half the income they needed. It called for the number of premier clubs in Wales to be reduced from nine to six, meaning Neath, Ebbw Vale and Caerphilly would cease to exist as professional entities, and demanded that the WRU entered into a partnership with them to administer the professional game on the lines of the agreement hammered out by the Zurich Premiership clubs and Twickenham earlier this year. Agreement was reached in England only after the players publicly sided with the clubs. The Welsh six hold the contracts of their players, only one of whom, the Cardiff fly-half Iestyn Harris, is signed up to the WRU, and there is the prospect of the RPW clubs withholding their players from Wales's Six Nations campaign which starts next February. \"That is something we have not discussed,\" said Stuart Gallacher, the RPW chairman, \"but the players are 100% behind us. The quality of Welsh rugby is below all levels of acceptability: the game, which is effectively bankrupt, has unequivocally failed to come to terms with professionalism and we are all now paying the price.\" The clubs met the WRU last week to hammer out a way forward but failed to come anywhere near an agreement. The Union's plans revolved around contracting the players centrally and fielding composite teams in Europe and the Celtic League: the clubs demanded the status of their counterparts in England and France, arguing that regional rugby would be a turn-off for players and spectators. RPW yesterday outlined its vision of the future. If it was an example of how it would run the game, it has a long way to go: it was abruptly and prematurely terminated and the document it presented to the media contained more in the way of slogans than policies. The clubs said they needed \u00a33m each a year to break even: they are currently generating an average of \u00a31.6m but, with sides guaranteed only 12 matches in the Celtic League and Europe, a six-team Premier Division would diminish the fixture list with the probability that BBC Wales, which has the television contract for domestic rugby in the principality, would seek a re-negotiation of its deal. \"We might have pain for a season,\" admitted Gallacher, \"but we need stability. The league has changed shape for each of the last five years and no one knows where they stand. What we want is an expanded Celtic League but how can we talk to the Scots and the Irish when we do not know how many clubs we will be fielding in the tournament next season? It is a time for action, not talking. Our game is still in the grasp of an amateur management incapable of delivering the change in the structure the game needs.\" The RPW clubs are all kept afloat by benefactors but Gallacher warned that the backers would pull out and players leave Wales unless the way the professional game was run changed. \"The game is unable to look the supporters of Welsh rugby in the eye,\" said Gallacher. \"What supporters?\" some clubs might ask with the champions Swansea attracting a crowd of 932 for their match against Pontypridd last Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
