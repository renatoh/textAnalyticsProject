The nine-times singles champion, knocked out in the second round of this year's event having been handed a wild card after a 10-year absence, teamed up with her fellow American to beat Marion Bartoli and Emilie Loit of France 6-2, 6-4. Navratilova has 20 Wimbledon titles to her name and needs only one more to beat Billie Jean King's record. The 47-year-old is also in mixed doubles action today, defending the title she won with Leander Paes of India last year. The Kent teenager Miles Kasiri yesterday lifted some of the gloom surrounding British tennis following Tim Henman's exit by reaching the semi-finals of the boys' singles with a 6-4, 6-3 victory against New Zealand's William Ward. The 18-year-old, who is 39 in the world junior rankings and won this year's junior title at Queen's Club, will meet his American doubles partner Scoville Jenkins in the last four. Britain's Jamie Baker crashed out in the quarter- finals in a 6-4, 7-6 defeat to France's J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
