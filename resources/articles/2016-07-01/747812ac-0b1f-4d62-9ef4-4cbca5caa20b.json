The Czechoslovaks have always looked to Russia, Tsarist and Soviet, for protection. The natural ties between eastern and western Slavs survived even the rough treatment meted out by Stalin. They were thrown physically into the arms of the Soviet Union because they had been abandoned by the west at Munich and they have always been inclined to blame the evils of their own regime on their own Stalinist masters rather than on Moscow. Now Moscow has put forward the view that the members of the Warsaw Pact have a right to intervene actively in the internal affairs of their fellow members in order to ensure the perpetuation of the sort of regime which finds favour in the Kremlin. This is putting back the clock not to 1956 but to 1948. There are signs that the Russians may have second thoughts; if they do not, 1968 could be the year in which their intervention in Prague led to the final alienation of the Soviet Union from what is left of the world Communist movement.
