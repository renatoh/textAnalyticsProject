The amber warning for wind in places across much of England and Wales until 9pm means that damage to buildings, travel disruption and power cuts are expected. Yellow weather warnings cover the whole of the UK until midnight. The Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said the size of the amber warning was very unusual, and showed how widespread the impact of Storm Ciara would be. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just coastal parts which are likely to see gusts of 70-80mph, but even inland areas, which don\u2019t usually see those strengths of wind.\u201d Burkill added the winds, combined with heavy rain would cause significant problems around the country. More than 100mm of rain has fallen in some parts of northern England and north Wales.

He said: \u201cThe reality of the climate crisis is that more extreme weather will happen more often and with devastating consequences. Insufficient funds are being spent on protecting the most vulnerable communities from flooding and the consequences of extreme weather. \u201cMinisters must urgently fund the schemes that these communities say they need as well as put in place longer-term flood prevention strategies with appropriate bodies to prevent flooding and protect homes. The government must act now to protect those communities who are currently underwater, unlike its previous woefully slow response we saw last year.\u201d A British Airways plane is believed to have made the fastest ever flight by a conventional airliner from New York to London.

Scotland\u2019s transport secretary, Michael Matheson, said: \u201cThe Met Office is telling us that we are facing a prolonged period of adverse weather, with Storm Ciara bringing strong winds and rain to most of Scotland this weekend. We\u2019re also being told to expect snow and high winds throughout Monday and on Tuesday morning, so there is the potential for significant disruption on the trunk road network, as well as other modes of transport.\u201d The emergency services have already been busy and seem set to have a busy evening ahead.

In Perth, three people were injured after part of a pub roof collapsed on Saturday evening. Amanda Owen, a farmer and shepherd in Swaledale, one of the highest and most remote hill farms in England, has posted footage that showed a livestock trailer being swept along by what she described as \u201ca flood of biblical proportions\u201d. Images and footage being shared by local people and others give a sense of what only be the beginning of the problems being caused as flood waters over top defences that have been built up in recent years. This was the sound of morning flood warning sirens being sounded in Hebden Bridge. Since then, we\u2019ve spoken to local people in the Calder Valley, who told of watching cars being swept away and water engulfing flood defences that have been built up over the past four years to the tune of tens of millions of pounds since major flooding in Christmas 2015 \u201cWhen we got up this morning it was evidently flooding form 8 to 9am but within an hour or two the river was about to breach its banks and abandoned cars were being swept away,\u201d I was told by Ben Myers, an author in the town who has written about the impact of flooding. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite bad now and it looks certain that scores of businesses will have to shut here and in Hebden. So much was spent and so many promises were made in the past but it feels like there will have to be another rethink.\u201d This is the Guardian\u2019s liveblog coverage of the hurricane-force winds and rain which have rocked Britain\u2019s transport network and caused widespread flooding that is being categorised in some areas as presenting a threat to life. Storm Ciara is bringing fresh misery to communities that have suffered particularly badly in the past in the north of England, such as Yorkshire\u2019s Calder Valley. The Environment Agency has issued a severe flood warning, meaning there is a danger to life, for the River Nidd at Pateley Bridge and Bewerley, in North Yorkshire. There are also currently 214 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action is required, and 177 alerts, indicating flooding is possible. Amid heavy rain and winds of more than 80mph, transport links are also being disrupted amid multiple cancellations to flights, ferry crossings and train services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
