Following their comprehensive 2-0 defeat in Valencia last week, Liverpool must avoid defeat tonight if they are to maintain serious hopes of progressing from Group B into the second stage. \"The result in Valencia has to be a wake-up call for the team,\" said Liverpool's captain. \"There are only five more games in the group including tonight's match and we need to get enough points to progress. It is time for us to wake up and get those points. \"Everybody was disappointed by our performance last week and we must use that disappointment to drive us on. The way we lost the game was not acceptable because we played so badly. All of the players must look in the mirror and see what they can do better against Basle. We are all only human and sometimes you have a bad day at the office. Unfortunately, more than one person had a bad day last week.\" With Anfield hosting its 100th European game this evening, Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier has insisted that Michael Owen will retain the responsibility of taking penalties, despite the England striker missing his second spot-kick of the season against West Bromwich Albion last weekend. Owen has missed six of his last 12 penalties for Liverpool and has scored just once this season, a penalty against Newcastle. But Houllier insisted: \"Michael will take our next penalty. I've spoken to him about it and he told me that he would understand if I took him away from the duty. However, I want him to continue because he needs to take our next penalty and it will be good for him when he scores.\" The struggling striker has also received a vote of confidence from his England coach. Sven-Goran Eriksson said: \"Unfortunately he's not scoring but if you see every big striker in the world, now and then that happens to them and it becomes a thing inside the head more than a physical thing.\" Liverpool are without the suspended Dietmar Hamann and Vladimir Smicer, whose broken toe has still to heal. Liverpool: (probable 4-4-2) Dudek; Carragher, Hyypia, Henchoz, Riise; Murphy, Gerrard, Cheyrou, Heskey; Owen, Baros. Basle: (probable 4-3-1-2): Zuberbuhler; Haas, Quennoz, M Yakin, Atouba; Barberis, Cantaluppi, Esposito; H Yakin; Gimenez, Rossi. Referee: D van Egmond (Netherlands)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
