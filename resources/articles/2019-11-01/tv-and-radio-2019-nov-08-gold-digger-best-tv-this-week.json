Yet a chance encounter with a younger man at a museum proves to be the beginning of a passionate yet fraught relationship in this artfully paced family drama written by Marnie Dickens. Tuesday 12 November, 9pm, BBC One Hunted Law &amp; Order\u2019s Dick Wolf turns his hand to a scripted murder-mystery podcast in Hunted, following the efforts of working mum and detective Emily Barnes who is investigating the violent breakout of a maximum security prison. A gripping listen, with Parker Posey as Barnes. Podcast The Man in the High Castle Based on Philip K Dick\u2019s novel of the same name, this series depicting an alternate reality where the Nazis won the second world war comes to an end. Resistance against the American Reich continues but power hangs in the balance. From Friday 15 November, Amazon Prime Video The Unremembered: Britain\u2019s Forgotten War Heroes On Remembrance Sunday, MP David Lammy unearths the forgotten histories of Commonwealth soldiers from Kenya and Tanzania whose deaths in the second world war are largely forgotten. Lammy witnesses the continuing impact in African communities, and argues for their inclusion in ceremonies. Sunday 10 November, 10pm, Channel 4 Why Dad Killed Mum: My Family\u2019s Secret Tasnim\u2019s mother, aunt and grandmother were all killed in a house fire when she was 16 months old. Her father Mahmood was responsible for the blaze and now, 18 years later, is potentially eligible for release from prison. In this three-ep doc series, Tasnim bravely questions her father\u2019s motives and whether forgiveness for his horrific crime will ever be possible. From Wednesday 13 November, BBC Three Maradona in Mexico Fresh from Asif Kapadia\u2019s incisive documentary on the footballing legend\u2019s time playing for Napoli, this new series charts his efforts to turn round the fortunes of a local Mexican team based in the heart of Sinaloa cartel territory. From Wednesday 13 November, Netflix BBC Children in Need The annual charity telethon returns for another year of celebrity sketches and heart-rending testimony. Presenters include Graham Norton and Ade Adepitan along with the England football team, an EastEnders Strictly special and a revival of 70s kids TV staple Crackerjack. Friday 15 November, 7.30pm, BBC One The Cockfields Joe Wilkinson brings girlfriend Diane Morgan to the Isle of Wight to meet the parents in this three-part series. It is a well-trodden format but mum and stepdad Sue Johnston and Bobby Ball are cringe-inducingly funny as they negotiate spare beds for the couple and put on a bad lunch. Sitcom splendour from co-writers Wilkinson and David Earl. Tuesday 12 November, 10pm, Gold The Driver Walter Hill\u2019s masterly 1978 slice of neo-noir, taut and spare and set in a midnight-dark downtown LA, stars Ryan O\u2019Neal as the (getaway) Driver, Bruce Dern as the Detective \u2013 and the one is after the other. The sparse, fractured dialogue adds existential tones to Hill\u2019s revved-up thriller, which powers through a series of brilliantly executed, tyre-shrieking car chases. Saturday 9 November, 9.15pm, Talking Pictures TV I\u2019m With the Band: Nasty Cherry Uncompromising pop star Charli XCX does her best P Diddy in this new series charting her efforts to put together a new four-piece girl group, Nasty Cherry. Like a party-fuelled version of The X Factor, the show follows the group as they live together, record their first single and perform their first chaotic live shows, all under Charli\u2019s benevolent gaze. From Friday 15 November, Netflix"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
