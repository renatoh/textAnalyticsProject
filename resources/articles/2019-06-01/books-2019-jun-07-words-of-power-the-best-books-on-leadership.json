We can only hope that whoever wins the race to be the next British prime minister will know the difference between authoritarianism and authority. For Max Weber, the key is legitimacy. But how do you define that in an age when leaders bow to \u2018the will of the people\u2019? Our discomfort with the notion that a chosen few hold sway makes it easier to find depictions of bad leadership than positive exemplars. Novels, from Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch 22 to Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick to Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote portray leaders as capricious, deranged and, well, quixotic. Likewise, in The Mirror for Magistrates, a Tudor collection of poems, the ghosts of eminent statesmen recount their misdeeds and comeuppances while gazing ruefully at their own reflections. The poems were intended as cautionary tales for others keen to don the mantle of power. Much scholarly ink has been spilled debating whether Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince is a blueprint for pragmatic ruthlessness or a subversive satire. Machiavelli was a staunch republican who was arrested and tortured for his views. Did he dedicate his treatise to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici \u2013 the man who had him imprisoned \u2013 in a bid to rescue his reputation, or was he thumbing his nose? Changing attitudes towards authority can lead to long-respected literary characters being summarily knocked off their pedestals. Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer who defends a black man in Harper Lee\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird, used to be a hero \u2013 he was even quoted admiringly by Barack Obama. But the publication of Lee\u2019s earlier novel, Go Set a Watchman, revealed him as a more complex character. Leaders Eat Last, by the organisational consultant and \u201cmotivational speaker\u201d Simon Sinek advises leaders to put underlings first in order to maximise their performance \u2013 presumably this also helps them forget that their boss is being paid three hundred times more than they are. A similar strategy leads to disaster for the nameless narrator of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s luridly brilliant novel Rebecca. When she moves in to widower Maxim de Winter\u2019s imposing family seat, Manderley, she finds it difficult to give the servants their orders. Rather than rewarding her for her liberal attitude, they are horrified by this breaking of protocol. Unpleasant aspects of class are at work here, but the novel also offers a counterintuitive lesson in the importance of rules and norms, of authority appropriately exercised. Our hapless narrator is overpowered by the precedents of her semi-mythical predecessor, Rebecca, and Manderley burns to the ground. The feminist scholar Jo Freeman published her essay The Tyranny of Structurelessness as a pamphlet in 1972 \u2013 presumably after sitting through too many meetings dominated by someone insisting that everyone\u2019s voice is equally valid. In it she argues that an apparent absence of hierarchy often conceals informal and unaccountable leadership. Hannah Arendt was a prominent critic of totalitarianism, but she defended authority as the willingness to take responsibility. Whoever replaces Theresa May must at least acknowledge that they are in charge, rejecting the modish populism that paves the way for dictators. Ambition is more dangerous in disguise. \u2022 Anti-Politics: On the Demonization of Ideology, Authority and the State by Eliane Glaser is published by Repeater (\u00a38.99).
