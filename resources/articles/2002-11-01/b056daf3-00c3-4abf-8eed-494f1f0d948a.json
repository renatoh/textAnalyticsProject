The first major stop is Canberra. \"Yeah... Canberra. Well, it's alright for sheep.\" Doesn't sound promising. Then on to Melbourne. \"Melbourne?\" he says, more animated. \"Arsehole of the world.\" That good, eh? I daren't ask about Adelaide. The bus trip is part of the Oz Experience, a series of hop-on, hop-off bus routes all around Australia. Overnight stops, booked by the driver, are in backpacker hostels, and the clientele is largely European students on gap years. As a consequence of its market, the Oz Experience has acquired a certain reputation, especially for its east coast route, which passes a succession of beaches and attracts the most party-friendly passengers. Virtually everyone I spoke to about the trip before undertaking it suggested that it was a 40-strong tag-team debauch. As the raised eyebrows mounted up, my feet got colder. I am signed up for the south coast route from Sydney to Adelaide, via Canberra and Melbourne. Happily, it seems this stretch is much more sedate than the dissolute rigours of the east coast. My fellow passengers will probably be older, working travellers, keen to enjoy the culture, wildlife and scenery of the areas they pass through, rather than the other passengers. Boarding the bus at 7.30am in Sydney, my fellow passengers are about as animated as you'd expect for that time of day. But Peanut, our driver, is already excited about the trip ahead. He is not faking - he loves being on this bus more than anyone, and is eternally torn between the anticipation of getting to the next destination and the desire to savour the present one. The first day is a little uneventful: we all introduce ourselves, and chat a little, without much enthusiasm. Out of Sydney we hug the edge of Botany Bay before taking off up into the Great Dividing Range, which we will spend the next six days crisscrossing. The day's end finds us in Canberra, the compromise capital of Australia, set in an idyllic dell in the mountains. In Sydney, it's known as the sheep paddock, though this may have something to do with its less than legendary nightlife. That night, over a few beers in what seems to be Canberra's only pub, I find out more about my fellow travellers: Russell, a Brit who has recently graduated but is unsure what he wants to do when he gets home, Becky and Johnny, a Kiwi couple coming to the end of their time in Oz, and Nick, an RAF man between postings. There are also numerous Canadians and Dutch, but many of them are relatively retiring and slope off to bed shortly after dinner. The next day, we climb out of the lush valley of Canberra and into some forbidding tablelands, before descending through New South Wales towards Victoria. The rain holds off until we hit the Victorian border, but as the temperature drops, so the atmosphere on the bus starts to warm up. We've already lost some of the people who started in Sydney - one couple have inexplicably elected to stay on in Canberra. But, crucially, we've gained some new recruits. A couple of hours later, after a highly inadvisable game of bus skittles, we arrive at Gelantipy. RAF Nick and I treat ourselves to a pre-prandial horse ride out in the woods, where the call of the kookaburra is unmistakable. After dinner, most of the bus piles into the back of a ute, or pick-up truck, and we plough out into the moonlit fields. Within minutes the driver spots a possum in the treetops, followed shortly after by a saucer-eyed sugar-glider, then some wallabies and kangaroos. Suddenly we're following a more reclusive quarry, the wombat, waddling its way towards the cover of the trees with our driver in enthusiastic, if respectful, pursuit. He's explaining how dogs lured down wombat warrens are killed, when the ute tips sharply from the back corner: we've fallen into a wombat hole. Out we all pile to right the truck before trundling home for beers before bed. As we head down out of the mountains, the RAF man is getting restless; he's due to get off the bus that evening in Melbourne, to spend a few days there before flying on to Adelaide. \"Back to independent travel tomorrow,\" he boasts. \"Making my own decisions about where to go and what to do.\" He pauses. \"Actually, I'm going to stay in Melbourne. I'll probably go on the Neighbours themed bus tour.\" I have 12 hours to spend in Melbourne before reboarding the bus at 7am. By efficiently sleeping for only three of them, I manage to meet family there, and laugh about Neighbours-obsessed Brits while drinking in the pub in which The Secret Life of Us is filmed. The next day's travel is a wash-out; there are suddenly only six of us on the bus, and we're all half asleep. We're driving on the Great Ocean Road, built as a memorial to the dead of the first world war, which hugs the dramatic cliff-top scenery of the south coast, as far as Warrnambool, where we stop for the night. But the following dawn sees the start of the best day of the trip. Two of us have risen early to go horseriding on the beach, enjoying the spring morning sun on the spray, as the plovers wade in the surf. Leaving Warrnambool, we drop into an old volcanic crater, now a nature reserve, to spy on some charmingly indifferent koalas at close quarters, before driving up into the mountains again, stopping to admire cave painting in an old Aboriginal shelter at the base of a rocky outcrop on the way. Here, we taste the true capricious charm of the Oz Experience: some hard-drinking Canadians have opted to stay on the bus and sleep, but the rest of the party is on energetic form. Someone wants to scale the outcrop, so we all pile up through gullies, overhangs and along ledges till we're looking out on an unparalleled vista of eucalyptus forest stretching away to the Grampian mountains in the distance. After a night spent cooking a barbecue at a mountain lodge in the Grampians, we set off for Adelaide, arriving that night feeling a huge sense of achievement. Some of us have travelled together all the way from Sydney, others have just joined but are about to move on together towards Alice Springs. Nick the RAF man has flown in from Melbourne and is keen to rejoin the party for a few pints. In my two weeks, I abseiled, bouldered, bushwalked, rode horses at dusk and at dawn, and I finished my trip crab-fishing off Adelaide as dolphins played a few yards away. Early on, one of my fellow passengers said: \"You have to take the Oz Experience for what it is.\" It's not for wallflowers, nor for anyone who takes themselves seriously, and it is just a big bus following a well-trodden route. But for lone travellers with a little boy-scout spirit, the Experience's promise to take you from A to B via D, Y and W is surely a seductive one.
