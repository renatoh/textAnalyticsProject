The honor was accepted by the Rev Frederick D Reese, one of the march\u2019s organizers. It was a triumphant, if frustrated, ceremony, as some of the same congressional leaders who awarded the medal had also failed to pass a renewed voting rights act, after the US supreme court\u2019s recent dismantling of key legislation from 1965. \u201cI am certainly honored to be able to stand here and look into such beautiful faces and recall how good God has been, because he is a good God,\u201d said Reese, when he took the podium. \u201cHe brought us from nowhere to somewhere, allowed us to receive the great blessing that this great nation has to offer, and to stand here today to say, \u2018Thank you!\u2019\u201d But not everyone was jubilant. The award was prefaced with a press conference, which called for the restoration of the Voting Rights Act. \u201cThe Congress that wants to honor us won\u2019t get its act together to restore what we\u2019ve lost, what we worked so hard for,\u201d said the Rev CT Vivian, who also marched in 1965, in a statement released by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow our legacy to be neutered and relegated to the museums. A medal will not mollify us. The way to truly honor our sacrifice is to fully restore the Voting Rights Act.\u201d In March 1965, some of the civil rights movement\u2019s most famed leaders, such as Dr Martin Luther King Jr, gathered hundreds in Selma in hopes of securing equal voting rights for all. At the time, widespread poll taxes and literacy tests pushed many black voters out of the electorate. As marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge, they were attacked by Alabama state troopers, beaten and sprayed with teargas. Four protesters were eventually killed. Many credit the protest, and the actions of officers, with helping pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But a key provision of that law, which some considered the most important civil rights legislation of the century, was struck down in 2013 by the US supreme court. Congress\u2019s efforts to pass a renewed Voting Rights Act have all but hit a brick wall since, stalling in committee this year in the Republican-led House. \u201cThe men and women of Selma did not march for medals, you marched to demand action,\u201d said the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. \u201cIf we really, truly value the legacy of the foot soldiers, we must come together, Democrats and Republicans must come together, and pass a renewed and strengthened voting rights act without any further delay.\u201d Applause was light for Republican party leaders, such as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and Senator majority leader, Mitch McConnell, whose party has actively worked to install voter identification laws in conservative states around the country. Just one day earlier, a federal judge refused to stop laws in Georgia, Kansas and Alabama that require proof of citizenship to vote. And in states such as Texas, where some of the most rigorous voter ID laws are in force, lifelong residents reported sudden disenfranchisement when they lacked a driver\u2019s license. \u201cThe struggle for the right to vote without impediment continues in our own time,\u201d said Father Patrick Conroy, the US House chaplain during his convocation. \u201cExclusion from the voting rolls \u2013 not fraud \u2013 has been the greater scandal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
