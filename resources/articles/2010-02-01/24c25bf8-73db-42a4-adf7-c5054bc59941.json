The main work, however, is the Prokofiev piece, recorded here under the title Sinfonia Concertante (the Symphony-Concerto for Cello and Orchestra Op 125). Written for Rostropovich in 1952, and reworking material from an earlier concerto, it's a loose, baggy piece. Capu\u00e7on has apparently adored it since childhood. I have to confess that his performance doesn't convince me that the work does anything other than ramble, though you can't help but be seduced by the passion and irony of his playing. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra bring terrific drama and fire to it as well. The Tchaikovsky, though done with great dexterity, sounds a bit stiff by its side. The accompanying material is inconsistent as to whether the recordings were taped live or not. There is no audience clatter, but someone, probably Capu\u00e7on, does a lot of heavy breathing, while someone else, possibly Gergiev, can be heard singing along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
