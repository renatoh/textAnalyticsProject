But then, that's the winner of this year's Guardian secondary teacher of the year, David Miller, all over. Miller, a late convert to teaching, had been in the profession for only five years when he was asked by a teacher training college to tutor trainees in the creative way he used computers in the classroom. In his former life, Miller had started a computer software company and worked for Glasgow's arts festival. He'd also found time to have music he had composed published. Then, six years ago, his \"teaching moment\" came. He was working as a lay member of a children's panel. The panels, distinctive to the Scottish youth justice system, are made up of trained volunteers who sit at the hearings of children under 16 with convictions, family or social troubles and decide how the children can be helped. \"I kept thinking to myself how lucky I'd been with my background and my supportive parents,\" he says. \"I just realised what I really wanted to do was work with children.\" Poetry emotion Miller is now an English teacher and in charge of English trainee teachers at St Ninian's high school in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, near Glasgow, where he started his teaching career. This year's Teaching Awards judges can't speak highly enough of the lessons we observed him teach. In one, on what makes a poem, Miller captivated students with photos and a film clip closely tied to the poem Out, Out - by Robert Frost, on the accidental death of a child. He then read them the poem with what one judge says was \"such emotion that he brought an eerie silence and chill to the lecture theatre\". \"As the bell went and David brought the lesson to a close, the class gave a spontaneous round of applause. The lesson will remain in my memory for a very long time, and there was every indication that this was not a special effort but a very typical lesson.\" Another judge who sat in on the lesson says: \"The lesson showed his flexible and inspiring use of technology. His questioning technique was exemplary, with one question followed up by another. Students were praised for their answers and there was the same quality of engagement with all the students.\" In another lesson, Miller managed to tease out the complex themes of Robert Browning's poem Porphyria's Lover with 13- and 14-year-olds. One judge, a former headteacher, says: \"I have never felt myself to be as much of a learner as the pupils being taught. David did not tell the class what they should think, but engaged them so thoroughly that they were able to articulate their own thoughts. I would not have imagined that literary appreciation could have been so effectively taught to so young an age group.\" \"He used technology creatively, effectively and effortlessly, rather than for show,\" says another judge who observed the lesson. Miller's teaching style keeps pupils captivated, almost enchanted, and desperate to please and contribute. \"He teaches big classes, but you feel he's teaching you one-to-one,\" says one pupil. \"It's as though he's never done the lesson before. It's so fresh,\" says another. Suzanne, a trainee teacher at St Ninian's, says when she first observed one of his lessons she told herself \"this is what I need to be like\". Miller's academically most-able pupils say his \"discussion-based\" classes were the best preparation they could have received for university and university interviews. \"He gave us a very broad education,\" says former pupil Claire McKeen. But his talent extends to students of all abilities. Miller's colleagues and the award's judges testify that his lessons encourage ambition and cultivate self-reliance in almost every one of his students. Ultimately, Miller says, he sees his role as \"civilising the students\". No wonder, then, that he plays such an important part in extra-curricular activities. He's busy \"civilising\" pupils onstage as they rehearse school shows, on trips abroad and after school and at the weekend at the climbing classes he's started. Iain MacNamara, a parent, has helped out with some of the school's theatre productions. \"He brings children out of themselves,\" he says. \"He's got those who normally stand in the background dancing centre stage. I've seen how he inspires them.\" How many teachers could get teenage boys dancing in Calamity Jane, asks John Kelly, St Ninian's deputy headteacher. \"He'll bring on board pupils who are at the very least cynical. The kind of boy you would never expect to see in a school show is there.\" For Miller, this is not about choosing the best cast for a showstopper, it's about \"civilising his students by developing their confidence\", his colleagues say. \"He believes he is there to make wee Jenny the best in all she does,\" says one. Miller's list of accomplishments extends well beyond teaching to being a talented painter and pianist and fluent speaker of Italian. It's a wonder that he isn't despised out of jealousy. Instead, wherever he goes, he is adored. On a school trip to Tanzania two years ago, Masai tribesmen slaughtered a goat in honour of Miller. They then presented him with the most cherished part - the kidney. \"Neither of my children are the kind to gush about teachers and yet they gushed about David as all the other kids did,\" says Angela Pattoni, a parent. 'Great enthusiasm' \"He jokes with us, but there aren't discipline problems in his lessons because we respect him,\" says one pupil. They even let him get away with calling them \"pet\". \"He makes you feel positive. He's always smiling,\" says another. \"Even when he's had a day of teaching, he walks into rehearsals with great enthusiasm as though it's the best thing in the world.\" Miller will go beyond what is expected of teachers if it helps his students to develop. One pupil says he convinced her not to leave school at 16. \"Ever since, he's been emailing me about public-speaking competitions and things like that because he knows I enjoy them,\" she says. He has registered his students at Glasgow University library so that they can use specialist books for their dissertations. One year,he even got a part in a high-profile production of Guys and Dolls in Glasgow so that he could bring back the dance routines and use them in a school show. \"I'm in my final year at university and he is still helping me,\" says one ex-pupil. Miller has no children of his own and says he enjoys the company of his students. \"If he tries a new hobby, he'll ask the students if they want to come too,\" says Ann Marini. Another parent says the first thing Miller thought about when he broke his wrist was not how much pain he was in, but that he wouldn't be able to make the school trip. Miller is also a meticulous record keeper. His notes show exactly where every pupil is up to. His students say he marks work \"immediately\" and parents confirm that he is a \"first-class communicator\". There must be something bad someone can say about Miller, surely? Annoyingly not. \"He's a promoter of peace,\" says Father McMahon, St Ninian's school chaplain. \"This is a teacher the students are going to be talking about in their 30s, 40s and beyond,\" says one parent. \"It's not thought that there's a teacher like him in Scotland,\" says Kelly. \"Simply the best teacher I can imagine,\" concludes one of his pupils. \u2022 Jessica Shepherd was among the judges for the Guardian award Guardian award for teacher of the year in a secondary school Regional winners David Miller, St Ninian's high (Scotland); Stephen Craggs, Ansford school (West); Nicola Stanfield, Haybridge high school and sixth form (West Midlands); Sheila Bevins, Cardiff high (Wales); James Gregory, Devonport high school for girls (South-west); Meeghan Tearle, Cantell maths and computing college (South); Howard Wood, Oathall community college (South-east); Shelia McFall, St Rose's girls' high (Northern Ireland); Martin Vevers, Cheadle Hulme high (North-west); Geoff Hatch, Joseph Rowntree school (North); Ian Redford, Thornhill school business &amp; enterprise college (North-east &amp; Cumbria); Michelle Day, Emerson Park school (London); Angela Gibbons, Greensward college (East); Helen Brittain, William Farr CE comprehensive (East Midlands) Do you know next year's winner?
