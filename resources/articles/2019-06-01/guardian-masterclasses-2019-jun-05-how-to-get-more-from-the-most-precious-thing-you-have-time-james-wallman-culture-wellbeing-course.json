We are busier than ever, caught in the busy trap of work, life, mobile phones, the internet, and the never-ending menu of new experiences we wish we were doing. This combination leaves us feeling we\u2019re not making the most of our time, that we might be missing out - and is there anything worse than feeling left out? Recent research from scientists at the likes of Harvard, UCLA, Cambridge and the LSE shows that there are ample ways for making most of the time available to you. Author and keynote speaker James Wallman has distilled this research into an actionable set of seven rules, and a checklist that\u2019s easy to learn, remember and use. Through a mixture of stories and science, and fun exercises, James will take you through how to better utilise what\u2019s available to you to enhance your life. If you think you\u2019re spending too much time on your phone, you while away hours thinking it\u2019s about time you took more chances, you wish you made more of your weekends or time off work, this class is for you.
