Preventing Violent Extremism, the government's pathfinder fund for winning hearts and minds in the Muslim community, is a good example. In March 2007 Brent council and other west London boroughs received \u00a3634,000 from the Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE) fund. The aim was to build \"strong communities, confident in themselves, open to others, and resilient to violent extremism\". However, we encountered problems. The whole point of PVE was to fund moderate Muslim organisations who are trusted by their community and can deliver. But often groups we wanted to work with were reluctant and feared they would lose credibility if they worked under the PVE banner. They said the title connects Muslim people with violent extremism in a way that is unjustified, ignoring the fact the majority are law-abiding citizens. We agree. Associating Islam with this crime in such a crude way puts Muslims in a similar position to the Irish at the height of attacks by the IRA. West London boroughs therefore came up with a new title, Building a Stronger and United West London: Working with Muslim Communities. This is not to say we hid the government's name, but our new title made a positive statement about local Muslim people and our commitment to them. The old name continued to create extra pressures. As one of the groups we worked with put it: \"Hostility to receiving funding through the PVE strand is very high . . . it was only through the trust that the community has in us that we were able to calm fears and suspicion\". British Muslim or Wot? So how have we made a success of the pilot, despite these problems? Some west London boroughs have used funding to engage directly with radicalised Muslims. Here in Brent, we focused on people who have yet to go down that route. Some of our projects tackle the issue head on, but others take a roundabout approach. British Muslim or Wot? created a space for Muslim boys and young men to build a new narrative about being young, British and Muslim, using film and drama. Part of this was providing a good understanding of Islam. A charismatic person with a radical interpretation may be very persuasive; giving a good grounding helps these young men make up their own minds. The project also looked at the difference between religion and culture. For example, you may be brought up with strict rules about what women should wear, but these could be cultural rather than religious. Separating culture from religion helped people think how they could be Muslim and British. We also support those who want to stand up to extremism in their community. We have funded a programme to train young women in leadership and communication skills, which helps with personal and career development. Incidentally, it also gives them confidence to confront extremism. The results have been good. Building a Stronger and United West London has been evaluated by the Office of Public Management. It found 13% more young people felt they could \"influence decisions affecting my local area\"; 8% more described their area as \"a place where people from different background get on well together\"; and the number saying attacks and harassment because of race or religion was a problem dropped by 6%. Looking to the future Brent council has now received three more years' funding. This is partly because we have a large Muslim community: 12% compared to the 8% of Muslims in London overall. But it is also recognition our approach is working. Our next step is to encourage Muslim communities to develop stronger links with non-Muslim individuals and groups. Brent's police operations superintendent, Mark Goldby says our work has filled a gap: \"Brent isn't a major target for terrorism. But it's clear a lot more could be done in the communities,\" he says. \"We have got to take it all back to basics and stop people getting involved in the first place.\" This is not to say Brent does not need PVE funding. In fact, we probably need more. A number of convicted terrorists have lived in and around the borough, for example the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid came from Harlesden. Also banned organisation Al Ghuraba is openly recruiting in nearby Hounslow. The far right is seeking to capitalise by putting up stickers depicting Muslim suicide bombers. The organisation behind British Muslim or Wot? put the case for further funding in its final report: \"We found that without an affirmation of identity and a positive sense of self, participants expressed vulnerability and confusion about lifestyles or beliefs. \"Young Muslims have to contend with Islamophobia, social exclusion, negative media reporting and anger over foreign policy. What was most alarming was the extent of internalisation of the cocktail of issues . . . Without any outlets and forums to express themselves they 'bottled up' their feelings. The opportunity to discuss all these sensitive issues with their Muslim peers was a unique and cathartic experience.\" In this context, tact and careful use of language is essential. The government's new national strategy, which picks up the baton from PVE, is called simply the Prevent Strategy. This is a step in the right direction. As superintendent Goldby puts it: \"The moment you use the wrong terminology, people disengage.\" \u2022 Jennifer Crook is head of diversity at Brent council"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
