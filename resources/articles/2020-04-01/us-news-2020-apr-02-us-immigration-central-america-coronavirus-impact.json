Although she had a college degree, she was still living paycheck to paycheck and was stuck in a neighborhood of the capital Tegucigalpa ruled by violent gangs. So, after years contemplating migration to the US where she has relatives, she finally made arrangements to depart. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay in a neighborhood where there are massacres or where the people lock themselves in their homes at six at night because the gangs impose a curfew,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized I was more surviving than living.\u201d But by the time she was due to start her journey north, Honduras had closed its borders and declared a state of emergency. She could no longer leave her city \u2013 much less take a bus to northern Guatemala, to meet a coyote who would guide her through Mexico. \u201cI had thought that only a hurricane could stop me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t thought of a pandemic.\u201d Border closures and strict lockdowns prompted by the Covid-19 crisis have disrupted the migrant trail through Central America and Mexico, forcing some would-be migrants to postpone their journeys \u2013 and stopping many others in their tracks. The result has been a deterrent more effective than any wall Donald Trump could build. Activists across the region have reported a steep decline in the number of migrants coming from Central America since the restrictions were implemented. One Mexican shelter near the Guatemalan border said it hadn\u2019t received a new arrival in a week. \u201cThe crisis has facilitated Trump\u2019s policies because [Central American] migrants can\u2019t even leave their countries,\u201d said Sister Nyzella Juliana Dond\u00e9, coordinator of a Catholic migrant aid organization in Honduras. El Salvador closed its borders on 11 March, and the governments of Guatemala and Honduras quickly followed suit. All three countries in the so-called northern triangle have since announced internal lockdowns of differing strictness. The three nations had recently signed \u201csafe third country agreements\u201d with the US government under which they agreed to increase enforcement on their borders, and receive migrants who had transited their country on the way to the US. Only Guatemala had begun to implement the new measures, but it announced on 17 March that it would suspend the deportations of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the US to its territory. But Guatemala and Honduras continued to receive deportation flights bringing their own citizens from the US \u2013 despite concerns that the practice could accelerate the spread of the virus. In the past week, a migrant who was deported from the US to Guatemala was diagnosed with Covid-19 and a group of deportees to Honduras escaped from the shelter where they were to be quarantined. Guatemala has now requested that the US suspend deportation flights. Meanwhile, migrants who were already en route have been left exposed by the closure of shelters and the difficulties facing humanitarian organizations which would normally attend to them. \u201cThey are in a vulnerable situation because the guidance is to stay at home \u2013 but the migrants don\u2019t have homes,\u201d said Dond\u00e9, who mentioned a case of a large group of Haitian and African migrants who were detained after crossing into Guatemala from Honduras amid the lockdown. \u201cNeither Honduras or Guatemala wanted to offer them a place to stay.\u201d Migrants who already had arrived to Mexico have been left in limbo by the US government\u2019s decision to immediately return all migrants from Mexico and Central America who cross into the country irregularly along the south-west border. When restrictions are eventually eased, a fresh surge in migration seems likely: multiple would-be migrants who spoke with the Guardian said it was only a question of when, not if, they would set out for the US. And the economic impact of the crisis may in turn cause others to migrate.. \u201cBefore many people migrated because they lacked work and a dignified life,\u201d said Silva de Souza. \u201cNow there will be many more.\u201d Migrants who have come from even farther afield, have no choice but to try to push on. Mohamed left Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, in 2018, following the well-trodden migrant path via Ecuador, Colombia and the jungles of Panama. He was burning through his savings and racking up debt, but making steady progress north. But he reached Guatemala just before the government announced a state of emergency which has made moving on impossible. \u201cTravel has become very difficult,\u201d he said in a brief exchange via Facebook Messenger. But he was still determined to reach the US \u2013 even if he now has to move more carefully \u2013 traveling at night and avoiding large caravans. \u201cWith God\u2019s will, I\u2019ll get there. I will build a life of opportunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Joe Parkin Daniels"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
