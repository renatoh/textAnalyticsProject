Bye! Make no mistake about it though, that was an Ireland victory, not an All Blacks defeat. For New Zealand. the inquest will begin in earnest. Far too lethargic, too indisciplined in the first half they left themselves with just too much to do and having raced through the gears like only they can they could not quite get their noses in front and Henshaw\u2019s try proved decisive \u2013 in the same way that Sexton\u2019s missed penalty three years ago would have. They of course are not superhuman, they were always going to lose at some point but fingers will be pointed at the fact that it was in Chicago. All week has been one rampant PR machine \u2013 the All Blacks determined to spread their gospel to the US, aware of the commercial avenues it represents, especially with an impasse over the global calendar beyond 2019. It may of course have nothing to do with it, Ireland were inspired after all, but punt out that many pictures of players squeezing every last drop out of being in Chicago and fingers will be pointed. But they will be back. On a separate note, all England have to do is win all four of their internationals, another grand slam and they\u2019ll beat New Zealand\u2019s record \u2026 Rory Best is speaking to NBC on the pitch: \u201cWe just talked about attacking New Zealand. You can see how much it means to our boys. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the work we put in. It\u2019s been a long time coming, it\u2019s history made. We\u2019re ecstatic.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s winning streak of 18 comes to an end, paying the price in the end for a quite woeful first-half performance. Take nothing away from Ireland though \u2013 Murray, Sexton, Stander, Zebo, Best \u2026 take your pick, they were all fantastic. Standing up to the haka in a figure of eight in tribute to Anthony Foley, Ireland were magnificent from the word go. It got hairy in the second half, it was always likely to, and when Scott Barrett\u2019s try \u2013 converted by his brother Beauden \u2013 brought New Zealand to within four, the comeback felt inevitable. But it was not to be. New Zealand came back from 15 points to win in Dublin three years ago the last time these sides met but not this time. At the 29th time of trying, after 111 years, Ireland have beaten the All Blacks, in Chicago, in the same week as the Cubs ended their 108-year wait for a World Series. Remarkable! Absolutely remarkable! 80 mins: Carbery misses the penalty but it is not going to matter. Henshaw almost pounces on a loose ball for another try but it\u2019s a knock-on and a New Zealand scrum. There are seconds to go, the clock is red \u2026 it\u2019s an Ireland penalty! And that\u2019s the full-time whistle! 78 mins: New Zealand have the ball but it keeps going to ground. They\u2019re rattled and there is going to be no way back from this. New Zealand knock it on, give away the penalty and Ireland will cruise to victory \u2013 a first ever victory against the All Blacks in 111 years of trying. 77 mins: Carbery nails the conversion, and that should be that. 77 mins: WOOOWWWWWWWWSSSEEEERRRRS!!!!! Heaslip breaks from the back of the scrum, runs the switch with Henshaw who forces his way over. Jesus wept! 75 mins: Oh wow. Murray fires the scrum to Carbery, who finds Payne, who loops a brave pass to Zebo. His kick on is perfectly judged and Ireland swarm on Savea who is pushed out. It\u2019s an Ireland scrum, five metres out \u2026 a reminder that they lead by four points! 73 mins: Heaslip picks up and finds Murray who nudges through, New Zealand have it five metres from halfway. Barrett brings them into the Ireland half. Perenara has been fantastic since he came on. He\u2019s changed the game dare I say it but Ireland are still remarkably committed in defence and Trimble forces the error from Squire. Another Ireland scrum. Just over six minutes to hold out. 72 mins: New Zealand get the driving maul going, and going, Coles has it at the back and still they come forwards. Perenara almost snipes through but it\u2019s with the forwards again. It\u2019s knocked on by I think Faumuina. Respite for Ireland again. Although they\u2019ll need to win the scrum and go again. 71 mins: On a replay of the turnover, Carbery\u2019s knee appears to find Moala\u2019s back there. That looked painful, and he\u2019ll need some treatment. It didn\u2019t look malicious but it was a knee nonetheless. This break in play will no doubt suit Ireland. 70 mins: Barrett finds touch. There have been a raft of replacements but Coles is still on finds Read. Ireland have forced the knock-on on the edge of the Ireland 22 though and Murray boots it clear. Savea fields, kicks to Carbery who calls for the mark. And breathe a bit more. 68 mins: Stander rips off his scrum cap and throws it away. Murray puts in. Ireland keep the ball in hand and Dillane has a blast. Still Ireland are in their own half and it\u2019s New Zealand with the frightening line speed. Murray clears and Carbery was a shade too early with his tackle on Barrett. 66 mins: Carbery earns Ireland a bit of time with an excellent touchfinder so New Zealand have it in their own 22. It\u2019s kicked clear, Murray gathers but is pushed into touch, Coles takes the lineout quickly and the All Blacks are almost away again, Savea unable to hold on to the ball on the left. Scrum just inside the Ireland half. 64 mins: Beauden Barrett converts. And New Zealand are to within four. 63 mins: So it\u2019s a New Zealand scrum on the Ireland 22, five metres in from the left. Cruden is on and gets a touch. Squire drives New Zealand into the 22. Cruden then fires it out to the left where Coles is (again). And the Irish defence is breached again. Squire shows delightfully soft hands to feed the onrushing Scott Barrett who reaches out an arm to dot down. 62 mins: It\u2019s a scrum on halfway, Murray to put in. Carbery gets an early couple of touches, but Ardie Savea has turned over and the All Blacks race down the left. A certain try is stopped only by Kearney stooping to stop a grubber. New Zealand are simply breath-taking with quick turnover ball. 60 mins: Murray launches high again and his Munster team-mate Zebo takes a wonderful catch. New Zealand turn it over though, but Ireland follow suit. Joey Carbery is on for Sexton now. What a match for the New Zealand-born fly-half, who turned 21 on Tuesday, to make his debut in \u2026 59 mins: Sexton has cramp, so Murray takes the kick \u2026 but he rattles it over. That took some courage but Ireland have an 11-point lead. 57 mins: Barrett fires over a low, pretty ugly conversion but it\u2019s two points nonetheless. Ominous for Ireland. They need something to stem the tide. And they may just have it. A penalty at the restart against Read. 56 mins: New Zealand pinch the lineout, and they\u2019re up into the 22, and Ben Smith thinks he\u2019s over in the corner. And just like that New Zealand are back to within 10 with a conversion to come. Raynal will check with the TMO but it appears to be good. The All Blacks\u2019 ability to race through the gears is unparalleled in rugby union, and dare I say it world sport. The try is given \u2026 55 mins: Sexton\u2019s turn to go high, Barrett takes it, Ben Smith has it and straightens, and the ball is worked to Savea on the left. He pins back his ears but Trimble makes a fantastic tackle and Savea is in touch. And breathe. 54 mins: New Zealand have a lineout and work the ball the Barrett who goes high but Kearney gathers expertly. New Zealand have worked out their lineout problem, it seems. 52 mins: Barrett slots the conversion, wasting little time in the process. Ireland cannot go into their shells but that said, they need to keep New Zealand out for the next 10 or so minutes. 51 mins: New Zealand must show a bit of urgency and they race up to the Ireland 22. Ireland\u2019s line speed remains impressive but Coles wriggles through, offloads and somehow Perenara gathers to strike back for the All Blacks almost immediately. Here we go! 49 mins: From the left, Sexton is off target with the conversion. Zebo\u2019s try was worked with the kind of precision that is usually only seen in the southern hemisphere. Ireland have the courage of their convictions. It\u2019s going to take something extraordinary from the All Blacks to turn this around. 48 mins: Ireland need to make sure with this lineout. Best tries to find Stander, and does. Here goes the drive. It\u2019s rumbling towards the line. It doesn\u2019t get there, it\u2019s brought down illegally but Murray wants more than three, fires it left to Sexton who finds Zebo on the left. Yikes!!!!! 47 mins: Ireland\u2019s defensive line speed is remarkable. It\u2019s got Andy Farrell\u2019s fingerprints all over it and after New Zealand clear long, Kearney looks to have been tackled high by Moody. Raynal think so but he wants to check with the TMO. Marginal, the first hit is on the chest but it slips up to the neck. Penalty only. It\u2019s on halfway and Sexton hits the left-hand corner. 46 mins: It\u2019s scrappy, that\u2019s a shame for Ireland. Scott Barrett is on for New Zealand so he and Beauden are now the 45th brothers to play for the All Blacks. New Zealand scrum. Perenara is also on for Aaron Smith. 45 mins: And Sexton thumps the penalty down field. Best to take the lineout just outside the 22. 44 mins: New Zealand\u2019s drive goes nowhere but Trimble\u2019s attempt to claim Aaron Smith\u2019s high kick is dreadful. New Zealand are looking dangerous but Ireland\u2019s defenders are swarming. Barrett\u2019s loose pass is picked up by Squire so the All Blacks still have it. Loose again, this time from Aaron Smith. And Sexton? Yes Sexton makes the turnover. 42 mins: The subsequent clearance is poor though so here come New Zealand, up to the Ireland 22. Both props carry strongly before Coles pops up on the left. It\u2019s spilled forward though and Trimble wellies it clear. Up to just beyond halfway. 41 mins: We\u2019re back underway. Ireland clear their lines after fielding the restart and it touched black on the way out so Ireland have the lineout. A stat for you, 17 points equals New Zealand\u2019s biggest ever half-time deficit. They were also 17 down against Australia in Brisbane in 2011. Australia won that day 25-20. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that in Dublin three years ago, Ireland didn\u2019t score a point in the second half. What they wouldn\u2019t give for an early penalty in front of the posts. There two New Zealanders with some important words of wisdom to impart at the moment. Steve Hansen won\u2019t be panicking, he doesn\u2019t do panic, but New Zealand have a lethargy about them that they need to shrug off, and fast. Joe Schmidt on the other hand was visibly wounded three years ago. Do not underestimate how much he would love to guide his side to victory over the All Blacks. That is not a typo, Ireland are 17 points to the good at half-time at Soldier Field and they are worth every point. New Zealand, from the word go, have been horribly ill-disciplined and their lineout has been terrible with no Whitelock or Retallick but these are the world champions, with 18 straight wins in a row, those sort of things are not supposed to register. Ireland meanwhile are playing with an intensity that Anthony Foley would be proud of. Facing down the haka in a figure of eight in tribute to Foley, Ireland have been quite magnificent. Thunderous in defence, twice using the choke tackle to excellent effect, Stander is having a game for the ages. But it is the spring in their step, the confidence that has really impressed. There\u2019s no doubting that Ireland play well when Murray and Sexton play well and those two have been the most impressive performers. Kicking expertly and keeping the All Blacks penned in. Kearney is also having a stormer at full-back. This is the All Blacks though. They were 15 points down at the break in Dublin three years ago and rallied. They can score tries from anywhere \u2026 and they\u2019ve never lost to Ireland in 28 matches. And there is no doubting they will improve after the break. Don\u2019t go anywhere. 40 mins: New Zealand sweep from right to left before Naholo is finally brought down. And another choke tackle, executed perfectly, earns Ireland a scrum. In, out and off the field I\u2019d have thought \u2026 39 mins: Murray has it on the 22. Cane forces a crucial turnover for the All Blacks there. Perhaps a little bit of overagerness from Ireland. Barrett finds touch and there\u2019ll be a New Zealand lineout on halfway. 38 mins: Wowsers. Savea claims a Murray bomb but Stander, through sheer force of will, batters him back and effects the turnover. Murray clips one over the top into space and Ben Smith has to scramble. The All Blacks are on the ropes. 37 mins: Having said that, Ireland are not trying to hold what they have. They\u2019re happy to attack the frankly woeful All Blacks lineout and they have a lineout of their own after shoving Savea out of play. Here comes the drive. 35 minutes: Sexton receives a bit of treatment. that\u2019s a worry for Ireland because he\u2019s been excellent so far but he dusts himself down to knock over the conversion. Ireland must be thinking \u2018don\u2019t concede before half-time, don\u2019t concede before half-time\u2019 \u2026 34 mins: OH MY WORD! Murray, the standout player of the first half, shows and goes and dashes under the posts, catching Aaron Smith off guard. Echoes of Dublin 2013 x a million. Murray always seems to up his game against New Zealand and there\u2019s daylight between the two sides now. 33 mins: The usual scrum delays end with Murray finding Sexton and then the onrushing Payne up the middle. Sexton sends it hight. Barrett overruns it and Murray snaffles it. So Ireland are just outside the New Zealand 22. 31 mins: Van der Flier gets his hands on the ball before Zebo thumps a low kick straight at Naholo \u2013 who knocks it on. Again, everything seems to be going Ireland\u2019s way but the root of New Zealand\u2019s problems is their misfiring lineout. With no Whitelock or Retallick perhaps it\u2019s understandable. 30 mins: Stander dislodges the ball from Barrett though and Murray fires it away to safety \u2013 to around halfway. That\u2019s an excellent clearance. Stander is on fire. And Ireland claim the New Zealand lineout again! 29 mins: Smith kicks over the top, right into the corner but Zebo pivots and clears left-footed. Sharp work from the Munster wing there. Interest from New Zealand but they have it back, inside the 22 on the left. 28 mins: New Zealand rumble up to halfway and a bit of magic from Barrett works space for Moala, who finds Savea, who runs out of space. He gets it back, and makes what looks conspiciously like a forward pass, but New Zealand are up to the 22 and are building a head of steam. 27 mins: We\u2019re back underway after a long old break. Coles with the lineout on the New Zealand 10-metre line \u2013 and Ireland have disrupted it again. New Zealand scramble it back but excellent line speed keeps the All Blacks at bay. For now. It is indeed the end of Murphy\u2019s day so Van der Flier is on. It\u2019s a lengthy stoppage though. Murphy appears to be in a fair bit of trouble. Can\u2019t help but think that this break will be more beneficial to New Zealand rather than Ireland. 26 mins: Again Murray and Sexton link up well before Murray launches on \u2026 Zebo managed to catch it infield before taking it out. That was an excellent chase. A couple of injuries \u2026 Crotty is limping off so Fekitoa is coming on and Murphy\u2019s day is done it appears. He\u2019s down on the ground and in a lot of pain. 25 mins: Everything is going Ireland\u2019s way at the moment and a textbook choke tackle on Kaino earns a scrum for the \u2018hosts\u2019. 23 mins: Sexton, from just inside the 22 and to the left, makes no mistake. He prefers them from the left alright. 22 mins: Ireland win the restart so have it on New Zealand\u2019s 22. Zebo almost gets clear down the left. He can\u2019t get their but after Murray fizzes a pass into Coles, it\u2019s another Ireland penalty. Sexton will kick at goal \u2026 It was Kearney who won the restart. He\u2019s having a stormer despite a number of eyebrows (mine included) being raised at his inclusion. 21 mins: Barrett bisects the posts so New Zealand are back to within a score. Moala\u2019s fortuitous try, thanks to Naholo\u2019s magnificent run aside though, New Zealand have barely had the ball. 20 mins: Sexton and Murray and working the ball well but Zebo is caught a bit there, and after another phase or two New Zealand have forced the turnover and now they have the penalty. Their ability to scent an opportunity is frightening. Barrett will kick at goal though. It\u2019s in front of the posts but it\u2019s a measure that the All Blacks are a touch rattled. 19 mins: That\u2019s another penalty against New Zealand! Zebo was taken early at the restart by Naholo. Raynal gives Read a stern talking to. Sexton thumps clear and Ireland have another attacking lineout. 18 mins: Sexton is wide with the conversion so Ireland lead by 10. 17 mins: Best finds Heaslip, it\u2019s not clean but Ireland have it deep inside the New Zealand 22 and they\u2019re playing advantage. Kearney wriggles his way to just short! And it\u2019s another try for Ireland! Stander it is who picks up and dots down. Wow. Echoes of Dublin 2013! 15 mins: Ireland win it back though and continue to back their handling skills. Murray has been busy and really impressive early on. And Ireland have a penalty after a high tackle from Squire. More indiscipline from the All Blacks. And Sexton wellies it right into the corner \u2026 13 mins: Ben Smith\u2019s return kick is too long though and Murray calls a mark. It\u2019s a lineout right on halfway, and the All Blacks are under a bit of pressure \u2013 but Heaslip gives away a needless penalty. Silly. 12 mins: Ireland back themselves to go through the phases in their own 22 before Sexton wallops it down field but doesn\u2019t find touch. 11 mins: Sexton strikes it well and nails the conversion from the left-hand touchline. 10 mins: Ireland drive their way up to the 22 and New Zealand collapse the maul. Ireland play a bit of advantage but knock on so it\u2019s a penalty. Kicked to the corner. Bold. I like it. Here goes the driving maul again, it\u2019s almost over the line, it\u2019s right in the corner \u2026 it\u2019s a complete mess. We\u2019ll go upstairs. Raynal asks for a reason why he can\u2019t award the try but hints at a knock-on \u2026 Oooh the tension. Raynal wants another angle. The potential knock-on is straight from the lineout, but it has been ignored! And it\u2019s a try for Ireland! That was crucial with New Zealand down to 14. 9mins: Mathieu Raynal wants to have a look at the replay of something. Hmm. It\u2019s Moody with a potential tip tackle on Henshaw. Doesn\u2019t look good. Moody\u2019s going to get a card here. It\u2019s going to be yellow. Henshaw lands on his back/shoulder area which saves Moody from a red. Which is silly. But there you go. Sexton boots deep so Ireland have a lineout and look to get the driving maul going. 7 mins: New Zealand go through the phases, making ground with remarkable ease. Barrett then boots long and Kearney gives Naholo the slip. Ireland are closing in on halfway but they\u2019re being driving backwards. Towards their 22. But it\u2019s an Ireland penalty. Kaino not rolling away. Barrett misses the conversion so it\u2019s as you were. If Naholo does much more of that though, this will be a long day for Ireland. 5 mins: Well that was explosive. Ben Smith fielded a huge Murray bomb, Naholo scythed through the Ireland defence, stepping on the afterburners, and CJ Stander, racing back, knocked the ball into Read\u2019s face before Moala dots down. No knock-on, so it\u2019s a try. 4 mins: No mistake from Sexton and it\u2019s an early lead for Ireland after some early ill discipline from the All Blacks. 3 mins: Ireland have another penalty though \u2013 Moody not rolling away \u2013 and this one is definitely in Sexton\u2019s range. Remember his last kick at goal against New Zealand? I bet he does. 2 mins: Ireland have penalty, towards the right. Murray wants to go quickly but Sexton goes for the right-hand corner. Ireland on the front foot early on. The atmosphere, isn\u2019t exactly what it would be at Lansdowne Road, put it like that. 1 min: Sexton kicks off and Aaron Smith, back after missing the last three Tests, kicks clear. Best with the lineout on the All Blacks\u2019 10-metre line. Time for the haka. Look\u2019s like it\u2019s TJ Perenara with the honour of leading this one. Ireland form a figure of eight in response, in tribute of course to Anthony Foley. A lovely touch. After a tribute to Anthony Foley it\u2019s the New Zealand anthem first. My mum\u2019s from Timaru \u2026 I don\u2019t know the words. Now the Ireland anthem. My dad\u2019s from Tipperary \u2026 I don\u2019t know the words. From the sounds of things, nor does anyone else in the crowd. But I think no one knew when to come in, owing to a bit of superfluous fiddling. Moving swiftly on \u2026 Looking at the crowd, which is bathed in sunshine, it looks like there\u2019s more green than black but that said, there are plenty of New Zealand supporters in attendance. Anthems soon, we\u2019re less than 10 minutes from kick-off. A loose bet on Jared Payne to strike with the first try \u2026 a saver on Aaron Smith to do so. Which means I\u2019ve bet against myself \u2026 great. We\u2019re 15 minutes from kick-off and the closer we get, the more I can\u2019t see New Zealand being stopped. The danger is that the unfamiliar surroundings and an eagerness to please gives it the feel of an exhibition match, though if it\u2019s anything like the BaaBaas\u2019 draw with South Africa earlier that would be no bad thing. But let\u2019s face it, New Zealand will have to have a very bad day and Ireland an extremely good one to still be in the contest with 10 minutes to go. And it\u2019s one thing being in the contest with 10 minutes to go, another thing beating them. Indeed, Pat Lambie\u2019s late penalty being the notable exception, on the rare occasions that New Zealand are beaten it tends to be by more than a score. In other words, with a couple of minutes to go you\u2019d best be out of touching distance. My prediction: All Blacks by between 15 and 20. Time for a bet \u2026 I\u2019ll report back. The front row is unchanged from the 37-10 victory over Australia last time out but it\u2019s in the second row where it\u2019s all change \u2013 with no Sam Whitelock or Brodie Retallick, Jerome Kaino, he who was born in American Samoa, moves from blindside and Patrick Tuipulotu joins him. Liam Squire comes into the No6 shirt, Sam Cane comes back in at openside and Kieran Read captains the world champions from No8. Aaron Smith is back from a stint in the naughty corner and returns at scrum-half while the irrepressible Beauden Barrett continues at No10. As mentioned earlier Ryan Crotty is back at inside-centre with George Moala outside him. Waisake Naholo and Julian Savea are on the wings and Ben Smith is at full-back. On the bench is Scott Barrett younger brother of Beauden. The pair will become the 45th brothers to play for the All Blacks as and when Scott comes on. By the by, there are two more brothers \u2026 Kane, the eldest, and Jordie, the youngest and according to some the best of the lot. Ardie Savea is also on the bench and if both sets of brothers are on the pitch, it\u2019ll be the first time that has happened since 1961. By the by take two, the Barretts spent a couple of years in their youth living in County Meath, playing Gaelic football with St Brigid\u2019s club and St Fiach\u2019s National School in Ballinacre. It\u2019s Jack McGrath at loosehead, not Rory Best, who occupies his usual hooker position and captains the side and Tadhg Furlong at tighthead. Leinster lamp post Devin Toner and Donnacha Ryan are in the second row while CJ Stander, Jordi Murphy and Jamie Heaslip comprise the back row. Behind them it\u2019s Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton while Robbie Henshaw and Tauranga-born Jared Payne are in midfield with Simon Zebo, Andrew Trimble and Rob Kearney making up the back three of an experienced Ireland XV. Keep an eye out for the New Zealand-born Joey Carbery and the Leinster centre Garry Ringrose though \u2026 both are on the bench, both should get on and both have extremely bright futures ahead of them. Yours truly is also a big fan of Ultan Dillane who provides second-row cover on the bench while Josh van der Flier is another promising youngster and a headline writer\u2019s dream. Hello world! There can be no doubting that Chicago is the place to be at the moment. The Cubs have just ended their 108-year wait for a World Series victory and Ireland\u2019s wait for a win over New Zealand extends even longer \u2026 The odds that they will end it today at Soldier Field are long. New Zealand arrive on the back of 18 consecutive victories, as we all know a world record for a tier one nation, and as the All Blacks continue to explore commercial avenues in the US, they will be determined to put on a show. They\u2019ve been here before of course, cruising to a 74-6 win over the USA two years ago and the side selected by Steve Hansen is strong. It features Ryan Crotty, whose last-gasp try in Dublin in 2013 denied Ireland a famous victory over the All Blacks and while Ireland\u2019s XV is experienced and pretty much first choice \u2013 fitness permitting \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to see this as a precursor to their meeting at the Aviva Stadium in two weeks\u2019 time, where Joe Schmidt\u2019s side will have a better chance of stopping the All Blacks. Team news for you shortly but in the meantime, catch up with what happened earlier \u2013 namely a shellacking for Wales at the hands of Australia which, in ominous news for Ireland, suggests the gap between the north and the south is as wide as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
