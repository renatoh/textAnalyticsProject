Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s mob have won it a record seven times, including three times in the last four years, and may do so again through Ribchester (3.30). His Marois victory and his close second in the QEII make this impressive-looking colt the pick of this field and conditions appear in his favour today. By no means all of these will cope with testing conditions but, in view of his Jersey romp at a sodden Royal Ascot, he should. Ribchester\u2019s reappearance in Meydan was just OK but he ran too freely in the absence of something to give him a lead. He has a pacemaker here and should start to show the physical progress made since last year. Galileo Gold has something to prove after the way his three-year-old season ended and cannot be trusted to settle in the first half of the race. Somehow is more of a threat. Aclaim might be able to nick a place. 1.50 Newbury My Dream Boat didn\u2019t build on his Prince Of Wales success last summer and some will feel that was a fluke outcome. But he is very interesting back on the sort of soft ground that helped him that day and some of his efforts last year suggested this step up in distance would be very worthwhile. 2.05 Newmarket Here\u2019s a chance for the Queen\u2019s unexposed Call To Mind to force his way into the Derby picture. But on balance he might not be ready for Valcartier, who seems on a steep upward curve in light of his all-the-way Nottingham success. The extra emphasis on stamina here also looks like good news for John Gosden\u2019s runner. 2.20 Newbury Successful on both his previous starts on soft ground, Private Matter was a fair fourth in the Free Handicap last month, when the extra distance and a fast surface were against him. These conditions can get him back in the winner\u2019s enclosure, with Ryan Moore\u2019s presence in the saddle another plus. 2.40 Newmarket A few of these are starting to look a bit exposed but not Desert Frost, who made a winning debut at Doncaster a fortnight ago. He needs to improve on that but is a full brother to Birchwood, a Group Two winner at this distance who also coped well with soft ground. 2.55 Newbury A Salisbury maiden winner on soft last autumn, Mucho Applause ran into a good one when pipped by Atty Persse at Sandown on his handicap debut and seasonal return to action. He comes from the Andrew Balding yard that looks really hot just now and should benefit from the extra two furlongs. 3.15 Newmarket After wide-margin wins in two handicaps this month, Quench Dolly looks one to stick with, especially as the betting market seems intent on letting her be a backable price. This young filly is improving and may have more to offer.
