Last weekend we all went off to the 800-year-old Lord Mayor's Show (lordmayorsshow.org) - a pageant of wealth and military might which parades through the City of London every November, in defiance of the winter weather. The kids thought it was great - a cross between the tamest bits of Carnival and a walking history book, especially the pikemen and musketeers. The Lord Mayor's coach could have walked straight out of Puss In Boots, as could his feathery felt hat. As 131 Independent Commando Squadron were succeeded by the Royal Yeomanry Band, my 11-year-old uttered, \"When I grow up, I think I want to be a soldier.\" But the charms of the likes of the London Massed Bugle Band were lost on me, as was a stream of Rolls-Royces driving past as if boasting about being well off. And what do you have to do to become a member of the Worshipful Company of Paviors? It all seemed rather jingoistic and very old-fashioned. The best thing about the undeniable spectacle is it's free. The City of London may be the country's pot of gold, but not everything in the square mile is expensive. The Bank of England Museum (bankofengland.co.uk/museum) costs nothing - you can spot the difference between genuine and counterfeit notes and handle a real bar of gold. And a good 15 minutes of real storytelling is to be had standing in front of The Monument describing the Great Fire of London (or go up it for \u00a31.50, only 50p for kids). The heart of British capitalism is actually a great place to visit at weekends, as unlike every other area of London it's almost deserted. You can practically walk down the centre of Cheapside without being run over. Which is, of course, what the participants in the Lord Mayor's show did. My eldest is already applying to join the parade next year. As a singer, I hope, not soldier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
