His third album follows the template of its predecessors: romance reels at its heart, nostalgia aches in the crevices, lovers get \"lost in the gloom\" and lonely fellas haunt the streets hoping to meet \"a girl with a flower in her hair\". If there is a difference it's in the richness of the emotions and textures: with its luxurious, swelling orchestration, The Ocean feels bigger than anything Hawley has written before; Born Under a Bad Sign somehow more honeyed, lilting and tender. Earlier this year, Nancy Sinatra confessed herself a fan, and it's easy to see why: Hawley's old-fashioned, lovelorn, immaculately produced songs call to mind everything that was wonderful about Nancy's dad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
