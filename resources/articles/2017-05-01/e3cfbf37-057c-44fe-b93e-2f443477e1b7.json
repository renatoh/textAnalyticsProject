Michael Spence, the vice-chancellor of Sydney University, said the funding overhaul was a \u201cdisaster averted\u201d because the former Abbott government had wanted to cut university funding by 20% and Belinda Robinson, the chief executive of Universities Australia, said the changes were a \u201cbig improvement\u201d on the notorious 2014 budget. But they called the higher fees for students \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the lowering of the repayment threshold for student loans from $55,000 to $42,000 was a \u201cmajor concern\u201d. The Turnbull government on Monday revealed plans to save $2.8bn by cutting university funding and increasing student fees. As anticipated by the tertiary education sector, the government has dropped plans to cut university funding by 20%, replacing it with a 2.5% efficiency dividend on commonwealth grant scheme payments in both 2018 and 2019. It will also lower the repayment threshold for student loans from $55,000 to $42,000. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, said the government would lift the average student share of fees from 42% to 46%, with the taxpayers\u2019 share falling from 58% to 54%. The fee increases will be 1.8% each year starting in 2018 and totalling a 7.5% increase by 2021. Defending the cut, he cited a report by Deloitte Access Economics that found that, between 2010 and 2015, the average cost of delivery per student increased by 9.5%, while per student funding grew by 15%. But the university sector has criticised parts of the package. The Group of Eight (Go8), which represents Australia\u2019s leading research intensive universities, said it was frustrated by the government\u2019s attitude to higher education. \u201cIt is at odds with the prime minister\u2019s much-welcomed public commitment \u2013 less than two years ago \u2013 to economic growth through innovation, an educated workforce and research,\u201d the CEO of the Go8, Vicki Thomson, said on Tuesday. Thomson said it was disappointing to be presented with yet another budget that does not address the sector\u2019s fundamental issues \u2013 namely that the sector must continue to work within a distorted funding model that relies on the fee-paying international student market, external support and philanthropy to cross-subsidise domestic teaching and research \u2013 all to make up for the government funding shortfalls. Robinson told the ABC on Tuesday the further impost on students was \u201cregrettable\u201d because students already made some of the highest private contributions to their study in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But she said there were some \u201cvery positive elements\u201d in the package, too. \u201cOne of them, there is a program called the higher education participation and partnerships program,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one that had been reported to have been abolished in this budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical program on supporting students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to succeed at university. Not only has that program been retained, it will also be legislated which makes it much harder to raid in subsequent budgets.\u201d Spence told ABC radio on Tuesday he was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d to the minister for the work he had done thinking through the competing interests. \u201cBut it\u2019s also ... an opportunity missed because the government\u2019s done nothing about the significant cost of research and of course university research is fundamental to the innovation economy about which the government is so enthusiastic.\u201d The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said it was a \u201creal credit\u201d to the students, academics and university sector for fighting off the 2014 budget cuts. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say that this package is a good package for universities \u2013 we\u2019re still talking about $3bn of cuts,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cThe fact that the government weren\u2019t able to get the worst of their package through the Senate, I don\u2019t think should give people too much comfort. \u201cWe should be investing in our universities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
