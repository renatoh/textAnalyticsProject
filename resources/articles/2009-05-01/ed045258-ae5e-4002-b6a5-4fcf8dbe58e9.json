Bourne and Kane collaborated recently on the former's acclaimed Lost Something album, and the bassist brings his incisive phrasing and big sound to a Leeds-rooted debut venture of his own making here, in collaboration with Bourne on Fender Rhodes, Simon Kaylor on tenor, Simon Beddoe on trumpet and Joost Hendricks on drums. The music has links with the staccato and percussive melodic style associated with post-hip-hop contemporary jazz, and extensively deploys intricate rhythmic overlays whose nervy crispness and restlessness contrast with Bourne's spacily bleeping, gurgling keyboard effects. Hip-hop-style rhythmic buildups abruptly fragment into showers of free jazz; hotly Iberian horn harmonies are assaulted by admonishing rimshots. The trumpet and tenor prowl restlessly around one another, and Kane's huge, growling bass sound anchors the band so resolutely that drummer Hendricks is freed to play almost a frontline role. Some tracks, such as the title, are restless stop-start improv, slowly coalescing into bleary harmonies and then a building groove. The deep hook of Shut Up Sit Down is reminiscent of the Zawinul Syndicate, although there are plenty of excursions into raucous abstraction. The recording quality, however, is distinctly bathroom-like."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
