He emailed the opus to me... and I sat on it for a week. Well, in my defence, I've been in Dundee for a bit. But, no, that's no, that's not good enough. But anyway, here's the round-up of the first week of the year. \"With so much to pick from I've had to be brutal so apologies if you find your cherished work missing,\" says Limni. And from this week, he will be working with two exciting new signings - yes, CheddarFrenzy and ImperfectRex have agreed personal terms and are joining the Best Of writing team. For now, let us cast a wistful look back to the very start of the year... Part one: the serious discussion The ever-cultured GhostDaz posted this link to an article by John Lanchester tackling the well worn topic \u2013 can games be considered art? His conclusion seems to be, not yet, but \"if the good guys win, or win enough of the time, we're going to have a whole new art form\" The Chatterbox contributors were, of course, quick to offer up their own opinions and also addressed a less well covered issue \u2013 is a strong storyline actually desirable in a game? A further thread tackled the sticky issue of sex in games. There are too many posts to reproduce them all \u2013 check Wednesday's Chatterbox if the mood takes you. A selection of the best is below: Cagool: For me one barrier to games being accepted as art is the obsession with review scores. No-one has discussions about books, or films or paintings by resorting to \"it got 93% on metacritic\". PhilosopherK1ng: In particular the argument about gaming convention rings true - we all 'get' that games work in a certain way, but asking Joe Public to understand that your uber-strong, fast paratrooper can't hop over a three-foot fence (because it's an artificial barrier and denotes the edge of the playable area) to get past some enemies meets little more than a sneer. Whynotfatboy took the discussion in two new directions with one post: 1) Game stories. These are normally terrible - does anyone have examples of stories that worked? My favourite would be 'Thief', I actually cared what happened next, and the plot made sense (sort of) in game terms; e.g. using disease as a reason to restrict the areas you could access. Anyone disagree, or have better examples? 2) Pornography in games. The writer is talking about 'seeing what you shouldn't see', but I mean in a more traditional sense - I'm always surprised by how little sex/nudity there is in games and by the amount of fuss it causes when they do appear. I mean, think about the games market - lots of single males with time on their hands ... you'd think game porn would be an obvious step, but there is very little. If a character appears naked for whatever reason they are blurred or shadowed - this is in 18 rated games! I don't think I've seen a nipple in all my years of gaming! Is this going to change, or are games so different from movies that nudity will never be seen? ImperfectRex: Surely the big draw in movies with sex scenes/nudity is the actors or actresses? Games are different in that technology is only now reaching the point where computer generated characters would look convincing in the buff - and there would be little point in doing it as gamers know they're not real people. Umborous23: I don't want romance, I want a landing sim like Elite. Right a bit... left a bit.... down a bit.... wrong landing platform, slap in the face, game over. JuanBlanco: To have a great story in a game, it would need to be extremely linear \u2013 yet linear games are looked upon as being a negative thing by most. I suppose having a great non-linear storytelling game would be next to impossible to make \u2013 think about the amount of work, writing &amp; content that would go into something like that. On a personal level, Id love to play a game that moved me in the same way a great book or film would \u2013 nothing's came close to date. EnglishRed: No, it's just wrong; I don't play games to get cheap Soaraway Sun-type thrills. There is too much titillation in some games, particularly those with a fantasy bent. For example the women in Oblivion, why was their underwear so small? McBegbie: I kind of like the addition of relationships in RPGs and the like, it can add to the story somewhat. Mass Effect and Baldur's Gate 2 are two good examples. Illocon: my two bob is that interactive entertainment does not require a high level of story telling as it is not a passive form of entertainment such as film or theatre, and in many cases we make up our own narratives by the actions that we take. In many ways, over wrought exposition, or any exposition, is often to the detriment of our enjoyment as it can stifle the flow of a game and take events out of our hands. CBPodge: But nudity as part of romance is something that games can and maybe should do. A sex scene that says \"look, these two characters definitely really like each other\" and doesn't seem forced would be fine. A sex scene that says \"look, animated tits!\" would be crap. In my humble opinion CheddarFrenzy provided the best comments: Until someone in the industry takes a risk and manages to make something truly adult-focused and popular (think DC comics starting up Vertigo), this will probably continue, and people will still believe that depth in games means Lara saying something before putting on her black swimsuit... The game world needs some real auteurs, not people like Molyneux who had their heyday 15 years ago and now just talk the talk, but people who genuinely try and explore the possibilities of what interactivity means, and how emergent stories and gameplay can really be different to other media, whilst still maintaining an awareness of how interactivity works well. Part two: lateral thinking and Monty Hall Thursday must have been particularly boring as the Chatterbox regulars resorted to throwing some lateral thinking puzzles out. I'm just going to post the questions \u2013 work it out or read the blog for the answers! McBegbie: A woman, while at the funeral of her own mother, met a guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing. She believed him to be her dream guy so much, that she fell in love with him right there, but never asked for his number and could not find him. A few days later she kills her sister. What is her motive for killing her sister? CBPodge: A man and his son are in a car crash, and get taken by different ambulances to different hospitals equal distances apart and get taken straight into surgery. The ER doctor operating on the son walks into the operating theatre looks down at the boy and says \"I can't operate on him, he's my son\". What's going on? Umborous23: A plane takes off from London, half the passengers are English and half are from Belfast. It crashes halfway across the Irish Sea. Where should the survivors be buried? Apic: A woman is going up an escalator when suddenly it stops, all the lights go out and she starts crying inconsolably. Why? Davefalse: A man is marooned on a desert island, but is rescued before he dies. Many years later he goes into a restaurant sees Albatross on the menu and orders it. He takes one mouthful then walks out and kills himself. Why? (Keef adds: okay here's another easy one: a fit young man wearing a backpack approaches a completely normal-looking field. However, as soon as he steps foot in it, he dies. What happened?) Then all hell broke loose as KillerBee posed the Monty Hall dilemma: You're on a game show and you've got to the final round. There are three doors and behind one of them is a new car. Behind the other two are consolation prizes - a teddy bear. You pick one of the doors but then the host (who knows where the big prize is) opens one of the other doors to show you one of the consolation teddies. He asks you if you want to change your choice to the other remaining closed door or stay with your original selection. Should you stick or switch This kicked off a whole host or responses and pseudo-mathematical explanations, below is a selection \u2013 mostly of people getting it wrong rather than the lengthy explanations. Personally I still can't properly understand how it works, but I've given in and accepted the explanation on Wikipedia. CBPodge appears to be king of the puzzle and got it straight away: \"You always switch. It's a maths problem isn't it. All kinds of probabilities. I forget the name of it, but I remember being quite intrigued by it\". Bigworv: That seems like mathematical balls to me. Given you don't know which door it's behind the second opening is surely an independent event from the first, hence switching won't make a difference. I never agreed with this riddle. Makar27: They are probably talking about exactly the same thing on the Deal or No Deal forum right now, which is very worrying really... Humofevil: This kind of thing annoys me. Just shows you can apply abstract maths to anything without proving anything attached to real life. Once one door is removed from the equation there is a 50/50 chance of you having the right one. Switching (or not) does not effect this in reality. Riano: Slight issue with that puzzle - the host is always going to show a teddy bear - therefore mathematically you already know you have a 50-50 chance. Ergo one of the three is redundant and therefore no need to be in the calculation - you can only really try and use probability when there are two and that will be 50-50. It's a load of b@llox. Lazybones: Surely: If you stick with the one you've gone for it's always going to be one in three because there are three doors you're choosing from. But then when the one door is opened you're making a one in two choice ... Holy ... Now I get why you're still talking about this. No - it's always one in two because the host always takes away one of the teddy bears. Is this what Riano was saying? Have I completely misunderstood the whole thing? M33nan: This has always bugged me, so I wrote a program this lunchtime in Oracle (handy language for me at the mo) to test it out. It simulates 10,000 of these scenarios with either the switch behaviour on or off. If you don't switch you win 33% of the time; if you always switch, you win 66% of the time. Totally not the result I was expecting. Maths is so weird. BeardOfBees used the opportunity to suggest a novel pub game: Say you're going to auction off a \u00a310 note between two or three other mates. The highest bidder, whatever price that may be at, pays you their bid and takes the \u00a310. The other bidder(s) have to pay you their bid amounts but DON'T get anything in return. It's all fun until you get to say \u00a39.50. Then person who's losing is faced with this decision: \"bid \u00a310 and break even, or do nothing and lose \u00a39\". So then the next person has: \"bid \u00a310.50 and lose 50p, or do nothing and lose \u00a39.50\". You can double or treble your money with a few people working against each other here. If anyone does it to you, agree on the sly with the other person to bid 1p, nobody compete, and you split the \u00a310 at the end and laugh. Anyone tried it yet? Part three: the actor question Everyone loves a bit of listing on a Friday and this week was no exception. Whynotfatboy agreed (with me) that The Hustler was a great film and said: Me and a friend sometimes try to think of actors that have been in five really good films (or directors who have made five really good films). It's harder than you think. Paul Newman is one of the few who definitely make it. Plenty of good suggestions, without going into too much detail: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise (BeardofBees) Sean Connery, Bill Murray (TonyHayers) Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Jodie Foster (Limni) Harrison Ford (Killerbee) Sigourney Weaver (Smellavision) (roundly condemned due to including Alien Resurrection) Michael Caine (Davefalse) Jean-Claude Van Damme (OfficePest) (a joke - I think!) Dan Akroyd, Robert Downey Jr, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall (Cmidrfti) Bruce Campbell (Ward10) Steve Buscemi, Jack Nicholson (Alimantado) Christian Bale, Brad Pitt (Kezabien) James Stewart, Humphrey Bogart (CheddarFrenzy - he really is the blog's cultural guardian) Alec Guinness (CommodoreSchmidlapp) Christopher Walken, Leonardo Di Caprio, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Costner, Keanu Reeves (CBPodge) Bruce Willis (HDStanton) Jackie Chan, 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano (APic) Jeff Bridges, Kurt Russell, Woody Harrelson, Peter Cushing, Charles Napier (CrispyCrumb) Daniel Auteuil, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Ingmar Bergman, Stephen Spielberg (Keef) Part four: the rest (including special guest category) Excuse of the Week: My bargain Motorstorm for \u00a317 didn't turn out too well. I got an email a week and a half after I ordered it (and a week after it had been apparently dispatched) to say it had been damaged in an accident with a leaky pipe. They've given me a refund but I can, of course, order another copy when they get a replacement. Unfortunately the price has now gone up. Fair play to them for trying to make up a ridiculous excuse. GhostDaz refuses to fall for the old leaky pipe con. Quote of the Week: I'm not a big fan of action movies - although strangely I do like the first Die Hard, and that is despite Mel Gibson being probably my least favourite actor of all time. The prize goes to Whynotfatboy for this little classic. He won't thank me for the reminder but was very broad-shouldered when dealing with the inevitable abuse! Other quotes: \"Lots of exercise and just not being at work, does wonders for the spirit. That and finding true love...\" Who are you and what have you done with TonyHayers? \"Drinking hit new heights over festivities, port, beer, wine, whiskey, moscato, sherry, lager, gin, champagne. When there was nothing left I even considered the bacardi breezers at the bottom of the fridge. Because I left it means I am not alcoholic.\" You keep telling yourself that, Mollocate. \"I had to euthanize one of my buddies - he kept getting injured and slowing me down.\" Chubster2010 is clearly of the 'firm but fair' school of friendship. \"I actually convinced my wife recently that the only reason Parent + Child parking spaces were bigger was because they knew that most of them would be used by women, so gave them more room to compensate for lack of parking skills. I think she still believes it.\" ArtieFufkin: never afraid to take on the PC brigade. \"I ate my body weight in Ginsters on the way home, I just couldn't get enough of them that evening.\" Bigworv creates his own nightmarish version of I'm A Celebrity's bush tucker trial. \"I'm very worried about Sunday's game. I have a feeling you'll beat us and beat us well. We're on a bit of a downward spiral at the moment.\" I've included my prediction for Sunday's Chelsea-Man U game in the hope of landing a job as a Guardian sports writer\u2026 Link of the Week: Norn Iron - thanks Lazybones Games: Call of Duty: World at War, Mirrors Edge, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Tomb Raider: Underworld, Chrono Trigger, Gears of War 2, Left 4 Dead, Far Cry 2, Halo 3, Valkria Chronicles, Banjo Kazooe: Nuts &amp; Bolts, Wipeout HD, Football Manager 2009, Lost Oddysee.
