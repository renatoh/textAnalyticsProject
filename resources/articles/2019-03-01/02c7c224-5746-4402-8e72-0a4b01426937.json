First Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men were frustrated by their hosts, then they were taken apart. Goals from Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Diogo Jota confirmed Wolves\u2019 superiority over their illustrious visitors. Marcus Rashford\u2019s strike in stoppage time changed nothing other than inconsequential statistics, halving Wolves\u2019 margin of victory and doubling United\u2019s tally of shots on target from a match in which they had a lot of the ball but were never in control. Wolves created the clearest opportunities and might have inflicted a truly embarrassing scoreline if not for some terrific saves by United\u2019s goalkeeper Sergio Romero. Solskj\u00e6r said this was United\u2019s worst performance on his watch. \u201cWe lacked urgency and quality on the ball,\u201d he said. He was right to add \u201cbut don\u2019t take anything away from Wolves\u201d, because Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team were excellent. This was the latest in a series of fine displays that makes it hard to believe the men from Molineux were in the second tier this time last year. \u201cIt\u2019s down to talent based on organisation,\u201d explained Nuno as if it were easy. Not only do his team stand seventh in the Premier League, with a semi-final at Wembley to come, they can realistically dream of winning a first major trophy since the 1980 League Cup. They are obviously not favourites for this competition \u2013 not with Manchester City around \u2013 but it would be folly to dismiss them. United also wanted to win it. Nothing about their approach here suggested they took this tournament or their opponents lightly. Solskj\u00e6r deployed his strongest available side, other than replacing David de Gea with Romero as per previous cup ties. He cast Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial and Ander Herrera straight back into the starting lineup after recent injuries. Nor was there anything to indicate that United\u2019s confidence had been dented by last week\u2019s reverse at Arsenal, their first domestic defeat under Solskj\u00e6r. They made a good start, popping the ball about with promising intent. But Wolves are savvy operators and, though deprived of the ball for most of the opening quarter, they kept the visitors out of range. The home team\u2019s goalkeeper, John Ruddy, did not have to make a save until the 13th minute. It amounted to little more than a warm-up, Rashford\u2019s effort from long range never likely to reach the net. Wolves were comfortable until the 26th minute when United opened them up with a cute one-touch move around the box before Lingard fizzed a low cross into the danger zone. Martial would have had a chance to score from six yards if not for an excellent tackle by Leander Dendoncker. Wolves soon threatened at the other end, Romero having to make saves from R\u00faben Neves and Jota. In a taut contest any misstep could prove costly. Both teams had appeals for penalties turned down before the break, and then Chris Smalling got himself in trouble in midfield and Neves pierced the remains of United\u2019s defence with a surgical pass from deep. Jota, however, was less precise, curling his shot too close to the advancing Romero, who batted it away. Having contained United in the first half, Wolves grew bolder in the second. United began to flail. In the 53rd minute Jim\u00e9nez, as strong as he is lithe and canny, held off Victor Lindel\u00f6f to connect with a corner by Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. The striker\u2019s header from eight yards was en route to the net until Romero tipped it on to the crossbar. Romero was forced into action again a few minutes later to push away a 20-yard shot from Moutinho. Now Wolves were seizing the upper hand. In midfield, Moutinho, Neves and Dendoncker started to flit between Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba and Herrera like artful dodgers confronted by dull bouncers. Solskj\u00e6r needed to make a change but he did not react quickly enough. In the 70th minute Moutinho wriggled his way into the box and slipped a low pass through to Jim\u00e9nez, who held off Lindel\u00f6f and Pogba before turning and firing low past Romero. Now Solskj\u00e6r replaced Herrera with Andreas Pereira. But Wolves scented blood and soon finished off their visitors. The killer blow came six minutes after the first. After clearing a corner Wolves overwhelmed United with a counterattack, Jota concluding it by outfighting and outwitting Luke Shaw before thrashing a shot into the net. United\u2019s woes deepened moments later when Lindel\u00f6f was dismissed for sliding through Jota to win the ball, but the referee downgraded the red card to a yellow after consultation with the video assistant referee. That was the only reprieve United got. Wolves\u2019 fans, meanwhile, hailed Nuno for guiding the club into an era that is reviving memories of their glorious past. \u201cIt means a lot,\u201d said the manager. \u201cAs I walked by the stands there were people saying they saw the 1950s and 1960s and are still coming to the stadium. To see this joy as they leave the stadium \u2013 with a lot of beer, of course - is great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
