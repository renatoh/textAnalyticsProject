Lewis says he was offered $50m (\u00a331m) to face the younger Klitschko brother Wladimir after attending the Ukrainian's successful defence of his world WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles against Alexander Povetkin in Moscow at the weekend. However, Lewis said the price for his return to the ring would be double that fee at $100m. \"That is my price tag and it is under discussion,\" he said. \"I have told them I can be ready in six months and I am in provisional training.\" Lewis believes he will fit to fight by next spring and will aim to emulate George Foreman, who regained the world title aged 48. The 1988 Olympic super-heavyweight champion has talked of a return to the ring before. \"I said at the time that it will take $50m to get me out of my pyjamas but now I have to consider the value of my legacy of having retired as undisputed champion. That will cost them $100m,\" he told the Mail. Lewis wants to fight the 37-year-old Wladimir as Vitali, 42, is now focused on a political career in Ukraine: \"I beat Vitali [in 2003] so I would like to fight the other brother but we'll see how it works out.\" He added: \"I will go back to the mountains and into isolation. With the Russians involved I am thinking of training in Siberia.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
