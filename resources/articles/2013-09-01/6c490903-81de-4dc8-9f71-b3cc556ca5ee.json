The proposals from the government-appointed Social Mobility Commission also suggest ministers develop a low pay strategy, including strengthening the national minimum wage and broadening the remit of the Low Pay Commission. The goal is to set workers on a pathway to increase hourly pay. Both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have acknowledged they need to do more to address the crisis in living standards, but this is the first official report to ministers setting out a detailed overall plan. Previously the low pay agenda had been seen as the exclusive terrain of Labour leader Ed Miliband. The report from the commission, chaired by Alan Milburn, urges ministers \"actively to encourage employers where it is appropriate to do so to pay the living wage. We acknowledge that it would be preferable to avoid the confusion of having separate minimum and living wage rates. With appropriate action it is possible over time that the gap between the two can be narrowed.\" The report also suggests government should use its purchasing power to push up wages among its contractors and proposes \"more muscular transparency\" to promote higher wages by changing the law to require listed firms and public sector employers to publish pay ratios. Jobcentres should test revised incentive procedures by rewarding success on the basis of total earnings for those helped, the report said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
