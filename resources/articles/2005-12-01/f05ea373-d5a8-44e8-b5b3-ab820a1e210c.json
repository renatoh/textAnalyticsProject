And there was the archbishop thinking that Christmas begins with a love in his heart that spreads to everybody in God's creation. He must have felt quite the chump. The leaflet, though, only told a half truth. Christmas ends at Homebase too. It ends in the queue for the customer service desk with an unwanted sander and no receipt, hating the person who bought it for you, hating in obscene detail everybody in front of you, hating yourself for being annually suckered, hating (in no particular order) Jamie Oliver, black Christmas trees, parmesan parsnips, hangovers, capitalism. Hating even the ill-paid, under-motivated schoolboy who deals with returned goods - even though you hope he'll like you enough to give you your money back. I don't suppose Sentamu will have a Homebase Christmas. He wrote yesterday about Jesus Christ: \"He descended on the human scene with an uncompromising message of love.\" The archbishop added that Christmas \"demonstrates God's presence with the human race. Christ's presence with us is permanent even though He cannot be seen.\" That juxtaposition of \"uncompromising\" and \"love\" pulled me up short. The idea that love - stereotypically so tender - could be fierce made me think how radically strange the Christian message is. That uncompromising love has been exemplified by two chastening stories of Christian forgiveness this year. Anthony Walker's mother forgave the racist who killed her son with an an axe. Yesterday, the devoutly Catholic mother of Abigail Witchalls, the then pregnant woman left paralysed after being stabbed by a man who later committed suicide, said of her daughter's attacker: \"His death is the real tragedy of the story.\" Even Sentamu, Britain's first black archbishop, wants those who sent hate mail to him covered in human excrement to come round for tea. Atheists like me are sometimes suspicious of such Christian responses, particularly when they risk collapsing into self-serving saintliness (as though vengeance and rage are unworthily human) even though, at other times, we can find them inspiring. Indeed, Christianity, properly understood, is alien to our baser motives. The Sermon On the Mount says not just \"love thy neighbour\", but something much harder, especially for us in this narcissistic age: \"Love thy neighbour as thyself.\" Even if that neighbour murdered your son, stabbed your daughter, smeared shit on your mail. Can we live by this golden rule? It is harder than getting an Ocado delivery slot at 4pm on Christmas Eve. Our moral fibre seems lacking. Only yesterday I read about a woman who couldn't get a book from amazon.co.uk in time for December 25. \"Online shopping ruined our Christmas,\" she said. But if her Christmas plans were so decadent that they could be destroyed by one cancelled delivery, it seems unlikely she would have the moral strength to try to love those she most hates, as a good Christian would. Her yuletide ruin typifies the fragile handle on reality many of us have at Christmas. It is not the most wonderful time of the year, despite what Andy Williams sings, but the most anxious and degrading. We might well call it a post-Christian Christmas, and if it's about anything, it is about perfecting a day and shoring it up against disaster. Hence Delia's foolproof 36-hour countdown to the Christmas meal. Why do we strive for such perfection? In Adam Phillips's book, Darwin's Worms, there are some clues. Before the death of God, we knew that our lives would be redeemed and that there was more than transience: ultimately, we would live in heaven with our Father for eternity. After the death of God, we realised we would no longer be redeemed, but felt compelled to do the work ourselves. We struggled futilely to recapture permanence and perfection rather than recognising they have gone forever. Phillips writes: \"Tyrannical fantasies of our own perfectibility still lurk in even our simplest ideals, Darwin and Freud intimate, so that any ideal can become another excuse for punishment. Lives dominated by impossible ideals - complete honesty, absolute knowledge, perfect happiness, eternal love - are lives experienced as continuous failure.\" Hence the post-Christian Christmas all around us. Phillips' message is as strange as Christian love, and bleaker. He suggests that certain \"ideals - of redemption, of cure, of progress, of absolute knowledge, of pure goodness - are refuges that stop us living in the world as it is and finding out what it is like, and therefore what we could be like in it.\" This conclusion implies that Christian love may be just as deluded as the grisly things that consumerist post-Christians do at Christmas. Perhaps Sentamu's idea that Christ is a permanent presence in Christians' lives is also a delusion, offering them false consolation for unbearable truths about the human condition. Phillips urges we should mourn the idea of permanence \"which we have represented to ourselves as God, or Truth\". Mourning, he says, is the necessary suffering that makes more life possible. That may not be what we want at Christmas, but perhaps it's what we need to hear. \u00b7 John Prescott yesterday attacked Tory leader David Cameron's Etonian mafia and said he looks forward to getting back to fighting the \"class war\". Fair enough, but where does he think his boss went to school? Whose side does Prescott think he's been on in the class war since 1997? And, while he obligingly plays the lardy, fast-handed prole clown, who putatively approximates the heart and soul of the British working classes, does he think he does the downtrodden in this class war any favours? Answers, as usual, on a postcard. \u00b7 Britain's return of its EU rebate will hit government spending plans between 2008 and 2011, it was reported yesterday. \"The size of the spending envelope for these years will be reduced,\" said a Treasury official. I was never good at economics, but if this is right, we shouldn't worry. If what's inside the envelope doesn't also shrink, then our worst problem will be getting it out. Happy days! \u00b7 This week Stuart watched the X Factor final: \"I liked Andy's reading of Me and Mrs Jones, but the evening - especially the new horror single That's My Goal - was otherwise a series of fresh hells.\" Stuart is listening to the 10-day Bach extravaganza: \"I wish Radio 3 always filled its schedules with beautiful music like this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
