The Uptown Funk star was introduced at the New Yorker festival by the magazine\u2019s staff writer John Seabrook, who said that the producer had come straight from London where he was working on the much-delayed album, thought to be called 25. Ronson said that many people had worked on the album, and that he wasn\u2019t sure whether his productions would make the final cut. Last month, Damon Albarn said that he had also worked on five tracks, but that he did not expect them to be released. He added that he had heard songs produced by Danger Mouse, which he described as \u201cvery middle of the road\u201d. Ronson described his rise as a hip-hop DJ in the 90s, saying \u201call of a sudden people like Biggie and Puffy and Jay Z would be coming to our club nights\u201d. One night, Puff Daddy gave him his number and a $100 tip. \u201cI framed it above my turntable for a long time, but I was probably making $300 cash a week at that point and at some point I had to open the frame to buy pizza. I told him this story about 15 years later and he reaches in and he gives me $100 and I think, \u2018this is a pretty good racket\u2019. I put the $100 in my pocket and the next day I\u2019m in a cab going to JFK and we get halfway there and I think \u2018Fuck, my wallet\u2019 and I realise all I have was the $100 from Puffy. At least the last time it made it six months \u2013 this one didn\u2019t make it a day.\u201d Ronson went on to talk about Amy Winehouse, saying: \u201cShe had really great chops, a really great way around the guitar with jazz chords because that\u2019s what she loved.\u201d He added that Winehouse never changed her lyrics once she\u2019d written them in a burst of inspiration. \u201cI remember when she first sang Back to Black and I was blown away by it but she sang: \u2018We only said goodbye in words / I died a hundred times\u2019. The uptight producer in me said: \u2018That\u2019s weird, it doesn\u2019t rhyme. Do you think you should change that?\u2019 She looked at me like I was an alien because to her, she wrote it like that \u2013 that was what came out.\u201d Ronson also described the recording of Rehab, which he said Winehouse first wrote as more of a 12-bar blues. When Ronson speeded it up after wondering \u201chow are people going to dance to this?\u201d, adding his own \u201cshitty drumming\u201d, Winehouse asked: \u201cAre you trying to make me sound like the bloody Libertines?\u201d The evening concluded with a performance of six songs from Uptown Special including Uptown Funk, now one of the biggest hits of all time, having spent 14 weeks at No 1 in America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
