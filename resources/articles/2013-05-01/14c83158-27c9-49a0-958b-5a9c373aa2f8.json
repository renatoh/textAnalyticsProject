Speaking in New York before returning home after a three day visit to the US, the prime minister said he was confident of finding a way forward over plans to relax child-to-staff ratios in England. Cameron also denied that he was biased against \"stay-at-home\" mothers after the government unveiled childcare tax breaks for working parents. He said the government was not seeking to \"dictate\" to mothers over the choices they make. A coalition row broke out last week over childcare when Nick Clegg confirmed he had raised objections to plans by Liz Truss, the children's minister, to allow child minders to increase the number of under-ones they can look after from three to four. This would increase from four to six for children over the age of two. The rules for three-year-olds would remain the same \u2013 eight or 13 children per adult depending on whether a graduate was present. Clegg said he feared that the changes would not improve childcare and may not even reduce costs. His remarks, which came after studying responses to a government consultation, prompted a furious reaction from the Tories. The prime minister said he supported the Truss proposals but added that he was open to negotiating a compromise with the Lib Dems. He said: \"On the ratios, I think trying to get quality affordable childcare is a very important priority for the government. I think the proposals that we put forward about both qualifications and ratios had a lot of merit. Clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the coalition about how best to go forward and respond to the consultation. \"But I'm confident, as with all these things, we will find a way forward. There's no point getting too frustrated about these things. We'll find a way forward that I hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare, which is a very, very major priority for people.\" The prime minister, who has faced criticism from the right wing newspapers for discriminating against \"stay-at-home\" mothers after the government unveiled childcare tax breaks for working parents, said he supported mothers whatever choices they make. He said: \"I support the choices that mums make and if they want to work we should support that and if they want to stay at home we should support that. The idea is not to dictate to people what they should do but to support the choices they make. There are lots of things we do do that help stay-at-home mums. The support we're giving for nursery education, for instance is a good example of that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
