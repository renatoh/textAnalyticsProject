I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Boris Johnson has spent a second night in intensive care in a \u201cstable\u201d condition with coronavirus symptoms as questions about who was running the country continued to rage. The prime minister was said to be breathing without any assistance and was conscious at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. Dominic Raab, who is the prime minister\u2019s \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d, led the daily government briefing yesterday and said the PM would \u201cpull through\u201d. But it remains unclear how long Johnson will be in hospital and Raab said he would need cabinet agreement to reach any major decision such as lifting the lockdown. No 10 said last night that there would be no review of the curbs next week as promised by Johnson when he introduced them three weeks ago. It was a testing day for Raab as Britain recorded its biggest daily death toll so far and an American university forecast that the UK would be the worst-hit country in Europe. It also saw chief medical officer Chris Whitty admit that the UK must learn from Germany, where the death rate has been far lower. Depressing figures also emerged on the other side of the Atlantic where New York state posted its highest daily death toll and the governor of hard-hit Louisiana acknowledged that African Americans made up 70% of the more than 500 deaths so far. Donald Trump caused a furore when he vowed to withdraw US funding for the World Health Organization, but then withdrew his withdrawal threat. He also flatly denied ever seeing memos weeks ago from a senior adviser warning him that the virus could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. Meanwhile, the lockdown in Wuhan has been lifted. Today marks the 100th day since the virus was first reported to the WHO and we have an interactive timeline on the 100 days that changed the world. In that time Covid-19 has killed at least 82,000 people and infected more than 1.4 million. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Viruses tracked \u2013 Increased human contact with wildlife is the underlying cause of the coronavirus pandemic as more hunting, farming and urbanisation has led to a fall in biodiversity. Examining the origin of 142 viruses known to have been transmitted from animals to humans over many years, scientists from Australia and the US found that domesticated animals such as cattle and dogs were most likely to share pathogens with humans. But rodents, bats and primates \u2013 wild animals that have adapted well to human-dominated environments \u2013 were implicated as hosts for nearly 75% of all viruses. Bats alone have been linked to diseases like Sars, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola. * * * Car crash \u2013 Fears are mounting that the economic shock caused by the pandemic could destabilise the UK\u2019s \u00a375bn car loan market. Around 6.5m vehicles are paid for by leasing deals with monthly payments that are already proving difficult for some people to meet as companies furlough staff in the emergency. The Finance and Leasing Association said \u201cthe number of forbearance requests has grown significantly in recent weeks\u201d. Volkswagen and Ford have introduced emergency measures to help customers with dealers desperate to avoid a wave of cars being handed back. * * * Moon shot \u2013 Despite the unfolding Covid-19 emergency, Donald Trump still found time to sign an order saying that the US would not comply with any international ban on mining the moon for minerals. The US presidential decree says: \u201cAmericans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, recovery, and use of resources in outer space.\u201d Coronavirus Extra There are some glimmers of hope from Italy that the worst of the crisis could be over. A doctor in Lombardy says his hospital is no longer at \u201cmaximum emergency\u201d but is returning to \u201cordinary\u201d levels. In the south Atlantic, an Antarctic cruise ship has reported that 60% of the almost 220 people on board have the disease. The Greg Mortimer has been stranded off Uruguay for 10 days awaiting clearance to dock in Montevideo. The mostly Australian and New Zealand passengers will be repatriated. John Prine, the legendary singer-songwriter, has died aged 73 from complications related to the coronavirus. The envy of more celebrated peers such as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson for his deft, compassionate and often very funny lyrics, Prine died in Nashville after being taken ill almost two weeks ago. In cheerier news from the US, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey is donating $1bn to fight the disease. A graduation ceremony in Japan has used avatar robots to replace students. And in one of the few countries in the world not to have any cases, Vanuatu in the Pacific, people wait in fear that it might one day arrive. Today in Focus podcast Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss how the prime minister\u2019s illness leaves a gap at the top of government amid a major crisis. Health editor Sarah Boseley describes how the disease progresses. Lunchtime read: How Twin Peaks redefined television It\u2019s 30 years since the first episode of Twin Peaks aired. It was like nothing we had ever seen on television, writes Scott Tobias, who explores how the show redefined the small screen and its array of characters such as Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) drew viewers into a weird and wonderful rabbit hole. Sport Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and members of his Tottenham squad have been pictured on Hadley Common in north London, having ignored government rules to train there during the coronavirus lockdown. Tottenham\u2019s all-time top scorer, Jimmy Greaves, is receiving treatment in hospital, the club have confirmed. Warren Gatland has raised the tantalising prospect of a \u201cdecider\u201d between the British &amp; Irish Lions and New Zealand in the UK next summer \u2013 possibly at Twickenham. Premiership Rugby has drawn up contingency plans, knowing the competition is unlikely to be given the all-clear to resume until the middle of summer at the earliest. Royal Ascot is ready to run races behind closed doors if it goes ahead in June. Formula One Group has placed half of its staff on furlough as the sport addresses the serious financial implications of coronavirus. The 2022 football World Cup is highly unlikely to be moved from Qatar despite the latest criminal indictment by the US justice department. And a GoFundMe page set up by Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s caddie aimed at alleviating hardship for bagmen on the European Tour during the coronavirus crisis has raised \u00a310,000 in less than a day. Business The International Labour Organisation says Covid-19 disruption could wipe out 6.7% of working hours across the world in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the equivalent of 195 million jobs worldwide. Markets in Asia have seen a choppy day of trading with some of the optimism of recent days draining away. The FTSE100 is seen falling more than 1% at the opening bell while the pound is buying $1.23 and \u20ac1.134. The papers Boris Johnson\u2019s health is the main concern for most of the papers with Dominic Raab\u2019s optimistic prognosis proving an irresistible headline for many. The Mail takes his words for its headline \u201c\u2018Boris is a fighter\u2026 he\u2019ll pull through\u2019\u201d, as does the Express \u201cBoris \u2018will pull through\u2019\u201d and the Scotsman \u201c\u2018I\u2019m confident that he will pull through\u2019\u201d.
