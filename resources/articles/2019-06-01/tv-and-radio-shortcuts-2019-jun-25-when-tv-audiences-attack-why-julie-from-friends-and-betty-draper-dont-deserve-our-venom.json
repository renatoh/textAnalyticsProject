In season two of Friends, Lauren Tom played Julie, the nice palaeontologist girlfriend of Ross. Tom recently revealed that her character was so unpopular among fans of the show clinging to their Ross/Rachel agenda that they would boo her during the tapings. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for the amount of venom I was about to receive in a live audience where they actually booed my character,\u201d she told the NBC show Today. But TV history is littered with (mostly female) accidental villains who inspired disproportionate fan fury. Skyler White, Breaking Bad Anna Gunn was so appalled by the loathing fans held for Skyler that she wrote a sharp defence of her for the New York Times. \u201cMy character, to judge from the popularity of websites and Facebook pages devoted to hating her, has become a flash point for many people\u2019s feelings about strong, nonsubmissive, ill-treated women,\u201d she said. It\u2019s still possible to argue that Breaking Bad\u2019s female characters were underwritten, but Gunn\u2019s articulate disgust at the vitriol Skyler inspired was wonderful and necessary. Dawn Summers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season five introduced a surprise little sister for the Slayer, upsetting fans who had not yet picked up on season four\u2019s heavy hints. Dawn was whiny, entitled and ruined every quiet night in, but Michelle Trachtenberg, who played her, argued that her more irritating qualities were true to the teenage experience. \u201cIt used to be a 60-40 \u2018I hate Dawn\u2019. Then it became 50-50. Now, I think it\u2019s 60-40 being supportive of Dawn. Maybe even 70-30,\u201d she told EW in 2017. Lord Grantham, Downton Abbey Hugh Bonneville received threats after his Downton character ignored the advice of a doctor, resulting in the death of his daughter Lady Sybil. \u201cI\u2019ve had hate mail and bomb threats, because I\u2019m obviously the most evil person on the planet for favouring one piece of medical advice over another,\u201d Bonneville said, although he somehow failed to call in the dowager countess to sort it all out. Jess Mariano, Gilmore Girls Luke\u2019s brooding nephew arrived in Stars Hollow with a bad-boy, won\u2019t-do attitude and a literary bro armoury of Beat Generation references. Milo Ventimiglia said that his first fan interaction involved a Gilmore Girls viewer telling him she \u201chated\u201d him at the gym, but at least Jess showed Dean up for the possessive creep that he was, so he wasn\u2019t all bad. Betty Draper, Mad Men January Jones said that once Betty had left Don, Mad Men fans turned against her, even berating her for sleeping with other male characters. \u201c[Fans] were mean to me on the street,\u201d the actor recalled. Oddly, and in contrast to most critics, she felt that Betty\u2019s fat suit era, written to disguise Jones\u2019s pregnancy, made people warm to her again, rather than leaving them wondering if the showrunner, Matt Weiner, had truly lost the plot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
