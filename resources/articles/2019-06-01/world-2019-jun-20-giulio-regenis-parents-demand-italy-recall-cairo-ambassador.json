Regeni\u2019s mutilated body was found on an outlying Cairo desert highway in February that year, eight days after he disappeared while researching trade unions in Egypt. An Italian autopsy found his corpse bore the hallmarks of torture, and there were widespread suspicions that Egyptian officials were responsible. An Italian ambassador returned to Egypt in August 2017 in an effort to \u201creinforce judicial cooperation and as a consequence the search for the truth,\u201d according to the then foreign minister, Angelino Alfano. But in the two years since, Italian officials have accused their Egyptian counterparts of impeding their investigation and of failing to provide vital evidence that could show how Regeni disappeared and who was responsible for his death. The Regeni family and Ballerini said the Egyptian authorities were instead focused on intimidating their legal team in Cairo. \u201cThis is an outrageous and disturbing attitude,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this point the only possible step is to withdraw the ambassador.\u201d A spokesman for the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs repeatedly declined to respond when contacted by the Guardian to ask about the Regenis\u2019 comments. Maha Ahmed, of the Cairo-based Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, is under investigation and risks imprisonment, according to the ECRF. The commission tracks enforced disappearances like Regeni\u2019s, while some of their employees act as the Regeni family\u2019s Egyptian legal counsel. \u201cWith Maha, they are repeating the same scenario as Amal Fathy,\u201d said Mohammed Lotfy, the executive director of ECRF. Lotfy\u2019s wife, Amal Fathy, was arrested during a dawn raid at their home last May and imprisoned until December, accused of a range of charges including \u201cspreading false news\u201d and membership of a terrorist group. Lotfy and the ECRF believe the Egyptian authorities are seeking to prevent them from working on the Regeni case by intimidating ECRF employees and their family members. \u201cI think the message is clear: take your hands off the case or else you\u2019ll get hurt,\u201d said Lotfy, adding that Ahmed\u2019s husband, Mohammed Helw, was one of the ECRF lawyers granted power of attorney by the Regeni family. An ECRF researcher, Ibrahim Ezz El Din, was forcibly disappeared a week ago. A team headed by Sherif Magdy Abdel Al, an Egyptian National Security Agency official, arrested a second lawyer, Haitham Mohamedeen, on 13 May. Abdel Al is one of five Egyptian NSA members named by Italian prosecutors last November as suspects in Regeni\u2019s disappearance. Italian officials are continuing to maintain pressure on Egypt. \u201cGiulio\u2019s parents will not be alone,\u201d wrote the Ppresident of the Italian parliament, Roberto Fico, in a statement on Facebook. \u201cNext week we will talk about Giulio with the German Bundestag: Giulio was not in fact just an Italian researcher, but a European one. It is a matter that concerns and must concern all the countries of the union.\u201d Italian prosecutors confirmed they had requested further evidence from their Egyptian counterparts after a new witness came forward testifying that one of the five accused men was overheard discussing Regeni\u2019s kidnapping at an African security conference in 2017. The Rome prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco, who is leading the investigation into Regeni\u2019s murder, said: \u201cWe have sent the authorities in Cairo an international rogatory [letter of request]. We can\u2019t disclose its contents. But we can say that our request is related to the new witness and that we\u2019ve had no answer since then.\u201d The ECRF believes that the Egyptian authorities are unwilling to shed light on Regeni\u2019s case owing to what it could reveal about the widespread practice of enforced disappearances in the country, where civilians are covertly arrested without legal representation or access to their families. The ECRF documented 230 cases of enforced disappearances between August 2017 and September last year. \u201cThe authorities say there are no enforced disappearances in Egypt,\u201d said Lotfy. \u201cYet while we are working on the case of a forcibly disappeared Italian researcher in Egypt, they forcibly disappear one of our staff members working on one of the most important cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re unafraid of public opinion. They want the world to believe what cannot be believed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
