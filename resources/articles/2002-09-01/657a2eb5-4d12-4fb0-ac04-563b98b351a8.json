But don't rush off to buy the latest how-to guide. We've saved you the effort. We've condensed the most salient pieces of advice into a five-day action plan. Aren't you the lucky ones.... Monday Remember what it's all about. Remember what it is that you, and your boss, are actually supposed to be achieving for the organisation. If you haven't already, write down your objectives - especially if your boss has never done this with you. Prioritise them. Then do the same for what you know or imagine your boss's objectives are. Try to appreciate the sorts of pressures and constraints placed on him or her. Try to figure out what would make their work life easier. Additional time? Extra support? Better organisation? New ideas? More comfortable footwear? Okay, forget about the footwear. But keep the rest in mind as you carry on through the week. Tuesday Try to understand a little more about your boss's style. We are not talking sartorial here. But we are talking modus operandi. Observe, discreetly, how your boss works. Then classify their approach as one of the following: Dictatorial Very, very bossy. Usually closed to new ideas. Reluctant to delegate. Often fast talking and fast acting. Has little patience. Bureaucratic Slow and ponderous in thought and deed. Loves order. Adores detail. Everything must be recorded, processed and systematically filed. Charismatic Fun, extroverted and energised. Full of new ideas. Able to motivate. But unfocused. Consultative Values input from everyone. Dislikes conflict. Tries to be agreeable. Decisions can be slow in coming but once they are made, implementation is swift. Laissez-faire Laid back, practically horizontal. Appears to lack a sense of time, purpose and direction, or is exploiting yours. Abdication Nicknamed Teflon. Nothing sticks. Time, events and other people make decisions for them. Visibly squirms if pressurised to be specific. Hides behind management-speak. Wednesday Once you know your boss's preferred way of working, play to it. Consider their strengths and weaknesses, their needs and prejudices. Then adapt your own behaviour to complement theirs. If this causes frustration, learn to conceal it. Act as though this is how you would, naturally, go about things. So, if your boss likes people to take the initiative, take it. If they like everything to be in writing, put it all down. If they want short, sharp capsules of information, get specific. If they enjoy having a laugh, lighten up. If they have milk but no sugar, remember that. (Only joking, actually, about the tea, but you get the general drift.) Thursday When something goes wrong, as it invariably will, don't go to your boss with the problem. Think, first, about how you could fix it. Factor into your solution the bigger picture. When you're ready, tell your boss that you are facing a 'challenge' and you'd like his opinion on how you plan to meet it. Be bold, practical and positive. Friday Volunteer to take on a new project. Exceptional workers compress what's expected of them into 80% of their time. They spend the rest on tasks that go above and beyond the call of duty. Ask your boss for a new project or, even better, suggest one. If he or she is not the most trusting of souls, you may have to think very carefully, about how you approach this. Prepare your case to take into account their fears and prejudices. Feed their thoughts back to them so they feel you understand their perspective. \"I can see how you would be concerned about x, y and z but have you thought about us doing a, b and c to get around that.\" When they give the go ahead confirm it: \"That's a great idea, thanks, I'll get started on it next week.\" Throughout the week Don't forget the basics. Be tidy. Be punctual. Be thorough. Get organised. Meet deadlines. Support your colleagues. Listen properly. Express yourself with clarity and tact. Show enthusiasm. Dress appropriately. Remember, though, that these are called 'the basics' for a reason. These are the minimum expected of you. Actually impressing your boss will take considerably more time, energy, application and imagination - something you may have already learnt by now. With thanks to...
