The long-expected move to split the two roles brings the company - which publishes the Independent and Independent on Sunday - into line with corporate guidelines on best practice. The company said Brian Hillery, a banker and former Irish MP, would take on the role of non-executive chairman. At its annual general meeting in Dublin today, the group also announced that the former Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, would be joining the board. In a trading update the group said advertising revenues across its operations - which include newspapers in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - had been \"buoyant\" in the first six months of this year, up more than 6% in constant currency terms. Circulation revenues would be up by 7% year on year over the same period, with the group's performance boosted by the success of the tabloid edition of the Independent, the company added. The new smaller-sized Independent, which launched eight months ago, increased the group's UK newstrade sales by a quarter. INM said it had recorded its highest circulation market share in the UK since 1996 as a result. The group also said its plan to cut costs was ahead of schedule, and that it remained \"firmly on track\" to produce annual savings of more than \u00a312m by the end of next year. \u00b7 NUJ members representing British and Irish papers in the INM stable met in Dublin today \"to exchange information and ideas\" about their concerns with the group. \"The NUJ is concerned at the disproportionate amount spent on executive remuneration at Independent News &amp; Media at a time when editorial resources are being constantly undermined,\" said the NUJ's Irish organiser, Des Fagan. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
