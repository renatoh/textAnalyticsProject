Fictional heroes don't come much more anti-heroic than Harry Paget Flashman, originally the villain of Tom Brown's Schooldays (1857), subsequently sent fornicating and malingering his way through a dozen high-class historical novels by George MacDonald Fraser, who died this week, aged 82. For Flashman is the last word in political incorrectness - a bullying coward and champion satyromaniac, whose first instinct when the bullets start flying is to hide under a barrel, and every one of whose glittering prizes - knighthood, Victoria Cross, Brigadier-Generalship, Queen's Medal - turns out to have been achieved by default. But Flashy's damn-your-eyes venality is not only an important part of his appeal - there is nothing like bare-faced insouciance for getting the reader on your side - it also underpins his creator's take on the Victorian world that seethes around him. Whether serving ingloriously in the first Afghan war, mistakenly storming the Russian guns at Balaclava, or reluctantly saving the Raj from disaster during the Indian mutiny, Flashman offers a series of eyewitness accounts of the imperial project. Here his value derives entirely from the self-centred amorality of his stance. Determined to record things exactly as he sees them, his is the worm's-eye view of Victorian history that regards war as a horrible, destructive mess rather than a quest for glory, and is at its harshest when deriding the amateur strategists of the breakfast tables back home. Some of the most fascinating scenes in the Flashman books, consequently, are those in which Flash knocks up against a genuine \"hero\" - a George Custer, a James Brooke - and tries, in a rather bewildered way, to work out why he behaves as he does, rather than settling for a quiet life, a bottle of brandy and the parlour-maid's embrace. All this is closer to an 18th-century realist such as Smollett than the conventions of shot and shell, overlaid by a high degree of authorial self-consciousness. I once suggested to MacDonald Fraser that Flashy was a triumph of post-modernist tricksiness, and got a roar of laughter. True or not, most modern fictional heroes seem pallid wraiths in comparison. DJ Taylor How dangerous is skiing? Over Christmas and new year, an 11-year-old British boy died while skiing in Colorado after colliding with a tree; a British snowboarder died in Garmisch, Germany, after falling down a canyon; a German skier died on a chairlift in high winds in the Swiss resort, Grindelwald; a local died in an avalanche in Whistler, British Columbia; and the opening day of Revelstoke, a new Canadian resort, was marred by the death of an instructor. These tragic incidents would suggest that stepping on to skis or a snowboard is one of the most dangerous activities in the world. In fact, it stands up well statistically. Research conducted by Dr Michael Turner, who has acted as chief medical adviser to several sporting bodies, showed that there are on average three injuries per 1,000 skiers, compared to 23 per 1,000 playing tennis, 64 at football and 96 at rugby. In terms of deaths, according to the National Ski Areas Association in the US, at 2.07 deaths per million, it ranks lower than sports such as swimming (62.1) and cycling (23.2). As with any activity involving velocity, a wild setting and crowds, there are dangers: wear a skiing helmet; only go off-piste with a qualified guide, heed avalanche warnings and carry a transceiver, probe and shovel for avalanche rescue; and follow etiquette on-piste that essentially equates to the rules of the road (see www.skiclub.co.uk). Some resorts have police and limit the avalanche danger by triggering controlled slides. As for the skiing v snowboarding debate: in 2001, the Western Journal of Medicine published research which suggested that snowboarding was the more dangerous. However, that was at the height of the sport's popularity, when young men (the highest risk group) were taking it up, often without instruction or helmets. Helmets are now fashionable and the young and reckless are as likely to be on \"new school\" twin-tip skis. Chris Madigan Who is to blame for the rail chaos? The easy answer is to blame privatisation, always a handy standby when things go wrong on the railways, but things are more complex than that. For a start, Virgin Trains, the private operator whose sleek high-speed trains couldn't get past Rugby station on their way to Birmingham and Manchester this week, is innocent. It wanted to run services, but Network Rail, which is private in theory but more or less an arm of the state, failed to get the track and power lines back together in time for them to start as planned before New Year's Eve. The Office of the Rail Regulator, also an arm of government, seems to have trusted Network Rail's promise to get the work done on time, even though Virgin Trains complained. The problem lies with the incredibly complex structure of Britain's railways, set up at privatisation and constantly tinkered with by the government since then. It is clear that in the case of the West Coast main line, not enough engineers turned up to finish the work on time. This wasn't Network Rail's fault, as it contracts out all big engineering jobs. The finger of blame points at the project management company charged with monitoring the work: Bechtel. Already there is talk of Network Rail dumping companies such as Bechtel and taking long-term upgrading work in-house, just as it took over day-to-day maintenance work after the Hatfield crash in 2000. But would this have prevented the new year chaos at Rugby and London's Liverpool Street? That's not certain. Network Rail does not have a blotless record as an in-house engineer. It admitted that one of its maintenance teams failed to spot the faulty points that caused the West Coast crash in Cumbria last year, killing one person and injuring 22 other passengers. The company argues that it is rebuilding skills lost in the dark days of private Railtrack. And that points to the real reason for the mayhem: there are not enough engineers in Britain. The education system, as much as the rail industry, should take the blame for that. Julian Glover"}, "isHosted": false}}}
