Rangers' farewell to their own fans was a dismal affair that encapsulated their season, although an unremarkable match proved memorable for the Edinburgh team. A presentation to the departing Ibrox players Henning Berg, Michael Mols and Ronald and Frank de Boer and a minute's silence for the victims of the Glasgow factory blast preceded the game. For 30 minutes, the contest was fairly aimless. Chris Burke for Rangers and Joe Hamill for Heart went closest in that turgid spell. Then the first genuine opportunity was created, Zurab Khizanishvili heading a Scott Severin effort from a Steven Boyack corner off the line. At least that prompted some worthwhile activity through the remainder of the first half. Craig Gordon did well to scramble away a Mikel Arteta free-kick and Mols went close after a darting run. Rangers, being watched by a potential signing, Alex Rae of Wolves, then pushed forward with a little more conviction but were consistently blocked by a Tynecastle team who defended in numbers and left only Graham Weir forward. It was not particularly pretty, but it was effective. Having decided width was the way to break Hearts, Rangers started the second half with Peter Lovenkrands on the left in place of Stephen Hughes while Maurice Ross replaced Frank de Boer meant a reshuffle at the back as Alan Hutton moved into the middle to partner Khizanishvili. The best-laid plans then fell apart as Hearts took the lead after 50 minutes with Hutton culpable. The youngster completely miskicked an attempted pass back to allow Hamill to meander on and drive past Allan McGregor. That certainly raised the tempo. Rangers were refused a penalty after Andy Webster appeared to push Paolo Vanoli, Ross fired wide and Mols left the Ibrox scene to a standing ovation and was replaced by Ronald de Boer, who was rapturously received."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
