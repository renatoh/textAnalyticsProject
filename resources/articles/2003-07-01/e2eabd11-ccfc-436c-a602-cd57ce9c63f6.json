Even before Shelford was dismissed last month with two years of his contract still to run, Fisher, the coach of the Australian Under-21 side who won the recent World Cup, was being linked with his job. Saracens already have a strong ACT link through their chief executive Mark Sinderberry and their player-coach Rod Kafer, but Fisher said he did not want to leave Australia before fulfilling his ambition of becoming the Brumbies' head coach when David Nucifora stands down. \"I was born in Canberra, I've done all of my coaching here and I'm working to one day be the first home-grown head coach of the Brumbies,\" he said. \"That's my goal and I think that staying here gives me the best chance of achieving that.\" Nucifora said he had been concerned that Fisher would join Saracens. \"I know that Mark Sinderberry was working very hard to persuade Laurie to move to London and I am delighted that he has resisted the temptation.\" Sinderberry had hoped to unveil Fisher on Monday but he now faces the task of finding an alternative candidate before the start of the season in two months, with pre-season training beginning next week. He wants the head coach to be in place before the friendly against Agen next month. Leeds's assistant coach Jonathan Callard, who is out of contract at Headingley, is one option, along with the former New Zealand selector Peter Thorburn, who left Bristol last month. Callard has been linked with the vacant position of head coach at Leinster after Matt Williams' move to Scotland but Leeds are expecting him to sign a new contract. \"Jon is currently out of contract but we are confident he will be with us for next season,\" said the Tykes' chief executive Gary Hetherington. \"Since the end of the season Jon has been involved with the England Under-21s and is now on a well-earned holiday; we will discuss a new deal with him when he returns.\" Callard, Bath's head coach two seasons ago, said: \"I am flattered to be linked with the Leinster job but I feel it is too soon in my career to take on such a role. There is still a lot for me to learn in my coaching career and my job has not been done here at Leeds yet.\" The Gloucester full-back Thinus Delport has been chosen on the wing for South Africa in tomorrow's Tri-nations international against Australia in Cape Town, one of eight changes after last month's unconvincing victory over Argentina. \"When I left for Gloucester last year I thought my Springbok career had come to an end,\" said Delport, 28, who will be winning his 12th cap more than two years after he last played for South Africa. \"Now I have another, unexpected shot at international rugby and I know that this will be my last chance to play in a World Cup.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
