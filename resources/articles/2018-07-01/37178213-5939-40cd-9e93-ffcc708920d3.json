A blast of Lagos colour rocks Dulwich's Old Masters", "bodyText": "A psychedelic castle will land on a lawn in leafy Dulwich, London, next summer, bringing a shocking dose of colour to the well-heeled suburb. Planned to stand like an oversize party hat in the garden of John Soane\u2019s sober Dulwich Picture Gallery, the great Technicolor crown is the winning design for the Dulwich Pavilion. The biennial commission, now in its second year, is a youthful alternative to the Serpentine\u2019s established pavilion programme across the river. Selected through an open competition and co-organised with the London Festival of Architecture, it aims to provide a platform for emerging designers rather than global stars, bringing some fresh energy to the oldest purpose-built gallery in the world. \u201cWe were trying to imagine what might have happened if Soane had extended his European grand tour to the African continent,\u201d says Dingle Price, one half of Pricegore, the practice behind the winning design, who developed their proposal with furniture designer Yinka Ilori. \u201cWe wanted to come up with something that could be more representative of today\u2019s London, and attract a wider range of people to the gallery.\u201d The architects established their office in 2013 down the road in Peckham Rye \u2013 the heart of London\u2019s Nigerian population, nicknamed Little Lagos. Ilori, whose parents were born in Nigeria, returns to Lagos several times a year to find inspiration for his bright designs. Their project, nicknamed the Colour Palace, was inspired by the vibrant hues of the Nigerian city, particularly the textile market, where jazzy wax print fabrics are densely hung from simple framed stalls, creating cavernous warrens of clashing patterns. This cornucopia of textiles translated into a piece of architecture takes the form of a bright blue wooden space-frame clad with overlapping layers of square timber battens, painted with alternating geometric patterns on each face. The effect of these multicoloured fringes promises to be mesmerising, with the patterns shifting as you walk around the structure, like a 3D lenticular image, vivid yellow circles melding with hot pink triangles. Raised on chubby red concrete legs, the dazzling cube envelops a flexible circular stage for talks, performances and yoga classes, while a raised gantry will provide theatrical views, encircling the space like a Shakespearean theatre. \u201cThe sense of theatricality appealed to me,\u201d says gallery director Jennifer Scott who, with six other judges, selected the design from a shortlist of six, narrowed down from 148 entries. \u201cI love the playfulness and the way the design speaks to a cultural heritage that\u2019s so pertinent to the area.\u201d She says the inaugural pavilion, erected last year to mark the gallery\u2019s 200th anniversary, helped to attract a much broader demographic to the hallowed shrine of old masters, with 40% of visitors having never visited the gallery before, and 20% being non-white. The exposure paid off for the architects, too: last year\u2019s pavilion designers, IF_DO, have tripled in size and are now working on a sixth-form college and a studio complex, along with several private houses. Their sleek pavilion, a Mies van der Rohe-style concoction of mirrored panels, meanwhile, is destined to be resurrected in the playground of a nearby primary school. Without the additional funds raised by selling the pavilion to a private collector, as the Serpentine tends to do each year, the biggest challenge facing the architects is the tight construction budget \u2013 a restriction that Soane in the early 19th century also had to deal with. Eight of his schemes for the gallery were rejected, before he was forced to settle on building with exposed brickwork \u201cin a plain and substantial manner\u201d, only using expensive Portland stone in the lantern, frieze and along the base of the building. But the constraints proved to be a boon, prompting a high level of rigour and invention in the layout and natural lighting of the interior, where the gallery spaces are arranged around an amber-windowed mausoleum for the gallery\u2019s founders. Soane\u2019s sequence of top-lit spaces have provided a model for gallery buildings around the world ever since. Dulwich hopes its pavilion budget of just \u00a360,000 will prompt an equal level of ingenuity, and has launched a fundraising drive to meet the target. As for Pricegore and Ilori, may their painted palace usher in a rainbow future, a more joyous strand of architecture that isn\u2019t afraid to indulge in pattern and colour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
