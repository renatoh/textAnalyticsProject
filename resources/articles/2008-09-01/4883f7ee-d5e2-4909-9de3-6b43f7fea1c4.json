For everyone else, it is a lesson in why caring can be such an all-encompassing, draining way of life. Yet early on at least, it is not as grim as that sounds, and is full of music, movement, film, dextrous puppetry and gentle laughs. A daughter cares for her father - a former musician who is declining fast, losing touch even with the past he remembers through music. The key theme is how as a society we don't talk about caring for the elderly. The father and daughter don't ever discuss their situation; in his company, she never actually speaks, while her brother dodges calls and sends fancily wrapped sweets to his father instead. This is an ambitious, multi-layered production squashed into a claustrophobic space, underlining the daughter's confined options. The puppets representing the father work brilliantly, starkly showing his decline, and the daughter's climbing and dancing over the set at night shrieks of frustrated hopes and desires. What limits this is not imagination or material; the decision to leave the daughter silent in most scenes falters dramatically. In the final scene, when she is on stage alone for the first time, and Nina Simone sings about a \"new dawn\", it is hard to fathom what has happened or her feelings about it. And there is also too much music, especially when it drowns out her few words on snatched phone calls. The point is that life is drowning the daughter out and rendering her invisible, but we still need a fully rounded view of her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
