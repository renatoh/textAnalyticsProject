The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead will impose public space protection orders (PSPOs) banning aggressive or proactive begging, requests for money, leaving bedding and belongings in a public area and urination or defecation in town centres in the area, including Windsor, Maidenhead, Ascot and Eton. Breaches would lead to a \u00a3100 fixed penalty notice, which would be cut to \u00a350 for early payment, but offenders could face a summary conviction and a \u00a31,000 fine if they fail to pay. The measures would be enforced by community wardens equipped with stab-proof vests and body cameras. Councillor Jesse Grey, the Conservative cabinet member for environmental services, claimed the Berkshire council was justified in introducing the proposals, which are part of a strategy to deal with the homeless population, which will take effect from 31 July. \u201cWe have accommodation for everyone who is sleeping rough. It\u2019s the ones who don\u2019t want our help that we have to do something about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe genuine ones who sign up to the programme, we want to help, but we need some sort of action to serve our residents and our businesses.\u201d The plan follow recent controversy over the council\u2019s approach to homelessness prompted by council leader Simon Dudley\u2019s assertion that rough sleepers should be cleared from the town centre for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which is taking place at Windsor Castle on 19 May. Dudley faced a no-confidence vote last month after he demanded police use legal powers to clear the area of homeless people before the wedding, claiming rough sleepers were making a voluntary choice and there was \u201chigh-quality housing\u201d available as an alternative. The new measures have attracted criticism from the homelessness charities Shelter and Crisis, and the human rights advocacy group Liberty. \u201cIt is wrong to fine or criminalise homeless people simply because they are homeless,\u201d said Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis. \u201cCouncils understandably have a balance to strike between the concerns of local residents and the needs of rough sleepers. If there\u2019s genuine antisocial activity, then councils should intervene, but people deserve better than to be treated as criminals simply because they have nowhere to live. \u201cIf enforcement is to be used, councils must make sure it is accompanied by access to meaningful support and accommodation so rough sleepers can escape the streets and begin to rebuild their lives. Without that support, rough sleepers are at risk of being further marginalised, making it even harder for them to get help.\u201d Under the council\u2019s new strategy, homeless people will be expected to sign up to a 56-day plan in which they are offered housing, medical and addiction services. If they do not comply with the plan, rough sleepers could face prosecution. But Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cIf somebody is forced to spend the night on the streets, that\u2019s not a lifestyle choice or antisocial behaviour. If someone begs for money, that\u2019s not harassment; that\u2019s a plea for basic compassion.\u201d Anne Baxendale, the deputy director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: \u201cPeople sleeping on the street don\u2019t do so through choice; they are often at their lowest point, struggling with a range of complex problems and needs and they are extremely vulnerable, at risk from cold weather, illness and even violence. They desperately need our help, support and advice to move off the streets into safety and, eventually, into a home. Stigmatising or punishing them is totally counter-productive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
