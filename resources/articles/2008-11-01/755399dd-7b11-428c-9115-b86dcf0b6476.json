In the full swing of her party girl phase, Jenna reminded us of her dad's boozy past. I always felt that the Bush family values were more of an enforced and much-practiced code of conduct than the natural byproduct of a happy family. I guess dynasties work that way. Now, Jenna is married and Barbara Jr always seemed more sensible. But from Mary Cheney to the Bush twins to Laura's repressed political views and tight smile, family always did seem loaded during the Bush-Cheney years. Since Barack Obama's victory on November 4, one of the purest expressions of many Americans' joy is the excitement with which we welcome the new first family into the White House. Obama's choice of the new first puppy (Goldendoodle or poodle?) vies with his Treasury secretary choice in discussion at the office and in the media. And from a political perspective, we can't underestimate the power of mommy and daddy in the White house. At a time when all Americans are rethinking their value sets, what better ballast than a young father as our commander-in-chief? The Chicago Tribune reports: \"I think you're going to see the president of the United States at soccer games and ballet recitals,\" said Dan Shomon, a former aide. \"That's going to be a priority for him.\" Shortly after winning the election, Obama went to parent-teacher conferences at his daughters' school before attending an economic summit with the likes of Robert Reich and Larry Summers. And, Michelle Obama has described her upcoming role as mommy-in-chief to emphasise that the girls will be her top priority while living in the White House. This doesn't mean Obama is going to become the Ward Cleaver of the millennial generation. But it does mean that we should be proud of ourselves for choosing a leader whose values are in the right place for our times. By choosing someone who focuses on his family, and not nine houses or a $150,000 wardrobe from Neiman Marcus, we too feel that we might survive this tough time, if only we can focus on what's close to home. When asked what's important to Americans now, Nancy Koehn, a Harvard marketing professor, said: \"We'll see value be much more tightly associated with home, family, hearth. Things that seem stable when a lot around us feels uncertain.\" It's definitely a G-rated honeymoon right now. To a greater extent than usual, kids are symbolic of this election. One of the most popular grassroots websites during the election's final weeks was \"Yes We Can Hold Babies\". On the eve of the election, journalist Ezra Klein wrote: On Monday night, at the Obama rally in Manassas, Virginia, I stood by the press railing watching the most poignant scene I'd witnessed during the whole campaign. There were two small children, both on their father's backs. At the beginning, they were about 10 feet from each other, staring anxiously at the stage. One was black, the other white. The little white kid had an Obama sign, the little black kid didn't. They took stock of each other. Soon, the little white kid leaned all the way over to try and give his sign to his new friend. The fathers, noticing, moved closer to each other. And the kids held the sign together. The most moving example I read was of a young, biracial couple named Erin and Mawi at Obama's Grant Park acceptance speech. Like thousands that night, they cheered and cried. But unlike the other revelers in the crowd, Erin was in active labour. \"By the time the giant CNN screen proclaimed Barack Obama the first African-American president of the United States, her contractions were coming every four or five minutes. Sometimes three. \"Barack Obama can deliver the baby,\" Mawi joked at one point. \"It'll be the least of his challenges in the next four years.\" This may seem crazy. But you have to understand the hypnotic energy of that night \u2013 a black president, the multitudes, Chicago's towering skyline lit up for the world \u2013 and you have to understand the particular way that mattered to Mawi and Erin. Late that night, they had a son."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
