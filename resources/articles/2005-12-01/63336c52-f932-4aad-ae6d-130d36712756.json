Mr Justice Beatson's address to the jury at Southwark crown court is expected to last until Monday, with a verdict likely later next week. The judge is taking the jury of six men and six women through some of the evidence that has been heard in the course of the seven-week trial. Mr Hipwell, former columnist with the newspaper's City Slickers team, is accused of using his column to mislead investors about the value of shares. The prosecution alleges that he and day trader Terry Shepherd conspired to ramp up the value of shares in which they had invested between August 1999 and February 2000. One issue the jury will have to consider, the judge said, is whether the Mirror's column had the power to influence the stock market. Another contested area of evidence on which they would have to adjudicate was whether Mr Hipwell knew or believed his share dealing was improper, he said. Mr Hipwell and Mr Shepherd deny charges of manipulating the stock market. The trial continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
