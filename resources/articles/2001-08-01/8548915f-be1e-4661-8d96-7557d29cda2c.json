Dame Helena Shovelton headed the powerful spending watchdog the audit commission for the last three years, overseeing several controversial reports. Last year, however, her handling of the lottery commission decision - of which she was also chairwoman - into rival bids by Richard Branson and Camelot, was heavily criticised and later overturned by the high court. Today Dame Helena revealed that her three year tenure of the audit commission was not going to be renewed by the government. She said: \"I'm disappointed not to be reappointed, but I've always been very independent. \"It is crucial that the person who heads the commission is equally committed to independence.\" She added that she was \"deeply concerned\" to see that her successor would keep up her record of independent-mindedness. The commission is still due to publish hard-hitting reports into hospital waiting-list targets and the use of agency nurses in the NHS. The move comes after news of a campaign to remove the Commons standards watchdog, Elizabeth Filkin, whose critical report led to the downfall of the former Europe minister, Keith Vaz. A spokeswoman for the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions insisted that Dame Helena had not been sacked, but was leaving as a result of her three-year term drawing to an end. Announcing her departure last week, the local government minister, Nick Raynsford, said: \"Over the last three years she has overseen substantial change at the commission. \"She has built strong and constructive relationships with the local government and health communities, and focused closely on outcomes and the public experience of services. \"Dame Helena's successor will have strong foundations to build on in carrying forward and developing into the future the audit commission's outstanding tradition of independent and constructive public service.\" A spokeswoman for the audit commission spokeswoman said: \"We are grateful to Dame Helena for her work. \"Any decision on appointment or reappointment is a matter for the government and, as a non-political body, the commission would not comment on it.\" Special report Whitehall Useful link The audit commission"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
