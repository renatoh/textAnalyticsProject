The 2008 Republican nominee for president, who is 81, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer, last year. He has been absent from the Senate. The McCain family statement said: \u201cThe progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\u201d McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, said on Twitter: \u201cI love my husband with all of my heart. God bless everyone who has cared for my husband along this journey.\u201d His daughter Meghan McCain, an analyst for ABC, wrote: \u201cMy family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year.\u201d Even in his absence from Washington McCain has been a strong and prominent critic of Donald Trump and his administration, drawing regular fire from the president. Last week, Trump snubbed McCain by not mentioning his name during the signing of a defence spending bill named in the senator\u2019s honour. Long known as an independent-minded presence in Republican ranks, in July 2017 McCain made a dramatic late-night return to Capitol Hill from treatment, to cast the vote that sank an attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act. He subsequently supported Trump\u2019s package of tax cuts. On Friday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Twitter: \u201cVery sad to hear this morning\u2019s update from the family of our dear friend \u2026 We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague. John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour.\u201d In his sixth term as a senator from Arizona, McCain is a key figure in a Senate chamber narrowly held by Republicans. If his seat is vacated before the end of this year, Republicans believe Governor Doug Ducey will appoint a successor to serve until 2020, when a special election would be triggered. Several possible replacements have been mooted, the most notable McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy. Ducey, a Republican up for re-election this year, has refused to engage in speculation. On Friday, he saluted McCain as \u201can American hero\u201d and commended his \u201cspirt of service and civility\u201d. Joe Lieberman, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut who was Al Gore\u2019s running mate in 2000, said \u201cbecoming John McCain\u2019s friend has been one of the great blessings of my life\u201d. McCain first ran for president the year Lieberman ran with Gore, losing the Republican nomination to George W Bush. He ran again in 2008, losing the White House to Barack Obama. McCain\u2019s selection of the little-known Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his pick for vice-president has provoked endless debate, particularly regarding the emergence of the hard-right Tea Party movement and Trump\u2019s capture of the party. McCain discussed that decision and other key moments from his life in a memoir, The Restless Wave, that was published earlier this year. A documentary about his life, For Whom the Bell Tolls, was also released. One of the Republicans defeated by McCain in 2008, former Massachusetts governor and 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, said on Friday \u201cno man this century better exemplifies honour, patriotism, service, sacrifice, and country first\u201d than McCain. Since 2015, McCain has chaired the Senate armed services committee. A navy pilot during the Vietnam war, he endured torture and refused early release during more than five years as a prisoner in the North. Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of McCain\u2019s war record has stoked controversy and earned the president, who did not serve in Vietnam, rebukes from veterans and opponents alike. On Friday, Trump did not immediately comment, not responding to shouted questions as he left the White House for a Republican fundraiser in Ohio. Another Vietnam veteran, former senator, secretary of state and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, said McCain was \u201ca brave man showing us once again what the words grace and grit really mean\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
