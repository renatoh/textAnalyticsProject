Hammond, who sought assurances after becoming alarmed by the spending promises being made by Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, disclosed that he had received private commitments from two campaigns. \u201cI believe that fiscal responsibility is one of the unique selling points of my party,\u201d Hammond said as he arrived at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. \u201cWe have over a long period built the hard-won reputation for fiscal responsibility and managing the economy and the public finances and I want to ensure that the candidates commit to carrying on with the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last nine years. \u201cA couple of the candidates have signalled privately that they will be signing up to the pledge but I\u2019m waiting to see what we get back.\u201d The chancellor wrote to the leadership hopefuls on Thursday asking them to maintain the current limit of the deficit at 2% of GDP \u201cat least through 2021-22\u201d, as he sought to block a tax and spend arms race. \u201cThe Conservative party has a hard-won reputation for fiscal and economic competence,\u201d Hammond had said in his letter. \u201cAs we enter the campaign to select our next leader, it is vital that we do not throw that away.\u201d Raab said he would reduce the basic rate of income tax by 5p, at an annual cost of more than \u00a320bn. Johnson, the clear frontrunner in the leadership battle, said he wanted to cut high earners\u2019 taxes by raising the 40p threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at an annual cost of \u00a310bn. Asked whom he was supporting, Hammond said his priority was to push the contenders into accepting the need for economic prudence, and for avoiding a no-deal Brexit. He said: \u201cI haven\u2019t declared my hand at this stage; I prefer to commentate on what\u2019s happening and to try to ensure that the candidates on the question of leaving the European Union and on the question of managing the public finances keep their positions sensible and in an appropriate area and that is where I\u2019ll be focusing.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about personalities, it\u2019s about policies. Before I could serve in any government I would want to look at the policies that the prime minister was setting out. I would not be able to serve in a government which had as its policy leaving the European Union without a deal.\u201d But in response to Johnson\u2019s suggestion that as prime minister he would hold back on paying the \u00a339bn divorce bill agreed by Theresa May with the EU in order to increase leverage in the negotiations, Hammond was dismissive. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that the UK is a country which honours its obligations. At least part of the sum which was agreed to be paid is part of our obligations under the existing [seven-year EU budget] so I would not recommend any of my colleagues to threaten to withhold payments which are part of an existing obligation which the UK has.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
