Details have been announced of an art programme on a spectacular scale, involving 2,000 sq metres of 8K resolution, 360-degree screens near Tottenham Court Road tube station. The artist Marco Brambilla will curate a programme of public art that he hopes will have an appeal similar to the ambition and excitement of Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall. \u201cAt this scale I don\u2019t think there is anything like this in the world which is so exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce it starts, hopefully it will become like the Turbine Hall. Think of those epic installations which we all remember like Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Weather Project and Bruce Nauman\u2019s sound installation. The ambition of it is to create a series of installations similar to that.\u201d The screens are part of a \u00a31bn commercial redevelopment of the Denmark Street area of central London. The street is nicknamed Tin Pan Alley and was once the heart of the capital\u2019s music scene. The project, Outernet, includes retail, bars, restaurants, offices, flats and a 2,000-capacity underground music venue \u2013 the biggest live music space created in London since 1940. The centrepiece will be a cube structure with the screens showing immersive advertising and promotional stunts but also art, which is where Brambilla comes in. He said the work on show might be provocative or spectacular but there would be times when it would be very intimate. One of his first commissions will be work by Belgrade-born Abramovi\u0107, a superstar of the contemporary art world and a pioneer of performance who has been using her own body, testing the limits of her physical and mental endurance, for more than four decades. Final details are yet to be hammered out but one work on show will be an exclusive version of Seven Deaths of Maria Callas, in which Abramovi\u0107 re-enacts opera deaths. Her appearance will coincide with the opening of her delayed and much-anticipated show at the Royal Academy of Arts. Other plans include showing Bruce Conner\u2019s film Crossroads, which uses unreleased but declassified footage from the US hydrogen bomb tests in 1946 at Bikini atoll. Brambilla is also creating a digital readymade work, involving a five-storey high photo-real metronome. He said the technology opened up opportunities \u201cto show digital work at a resolution which is almost lifelike, it\u2019s like a window in a way, it is so sharp\u201d. He added: \u201cThe technology just keeps getting better and better and I think it\u2019s got to the point where the technology is not part of the conversation, it becomes about whatever material we want to show.\u201d The redevelopment of Denmark Street, due to be completed by autumn 2021, will also include free-to-use recording studios and dedicated busking spots. A boutique hotel will be created in properties that were once home to the Sex Pistols, with developers pledging to maintain Johnny Rotten\u2019s graffiti. Philip O\u2019Ferrall, the chief executive of Outernet Global, said he was excited about the possibilities \u201cour epic canvas of screens\u201d presented. \u201cOuternet Arts is about creating somewhere works can be displayed that is inclusive and accessible for everyone, and Marco is the perfect person to lead all of this. He is inspirational and a true creative visionary.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
