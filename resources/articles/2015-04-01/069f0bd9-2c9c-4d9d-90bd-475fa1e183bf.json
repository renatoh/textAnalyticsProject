The pair spent 37 minutes together at the crease on the first day of their County Championship season-opener at Glamorgan on Sunday before Pietersen was removed for a 28-ball 19. But for Sangakkara, who began his two-year deal at Surrey with a 230-ball 149, there is no doubting Pietersen\u2019s quality. \u201cThe presence of KP is very important. When he walks out into the middle, his confidence and aura create immediate pressure on the bowling,\u201d said the 37-year-old Sri Lankan. \u201cYou have a fantastic player but there has been some controversy and strain in the relationship between him and the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cI think the spectators want to watch KP in the middle and, when you have a batsman of that stature and ability, I reckon even the side would like him there. \u201cIt\u2019s not my call to make but I just hope they iron out their differences. He\u2019s an out-and-out match winner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
