Any sale could lead to bumper payouts for David Shannon, the chairman, who owns 30%; David Lockyer, the chief executive, who owns 17%, and the finance director, Peter Foot, who owns 11% of the 171-year-old Leicester shoe company. The remainder is owned by the stock market-listed Development Securities, which under a previous guise backed the company when it delisted in the 1980s. Its desire to sell out prompted a review of the ownership structure, which began in March. Mr Shannon admitted a flotation was possible when the review was announced. But yesterday, as the footwear retailer published first-half figures showing a 1% rise in like-for-like sales during the period, the board admitted that a stock market listing was no longer being considered. The company, which also trades as Shoe Express, Peter Briggs and Lilley &amp; Skinner, said: \"Competition to buy the business has remained strong.\" The management, which is being advised by Clearwater Corporate Finance, called for final bids by the end of the month after already selecting a \"number\" of bidders to go through to the next stage. Mr Lockyer said: \"We are very pleased by the level of interest.\" He explained that the management had concluded that private ownership was a more suitable structure for the firm than the stock market. \"[The private sector] is the much more sensible place for retail businesses to be in. Any announcement from the ONS [Office for National Statistics] or BRC [British Retail Consortium] which is good news sends shares up, bad news sends share prices down. It doesn't reflect the underlying business,\" he said. Mr Lockyer and the finance director are expected to stay with the business, while the chairman is expected to leave. The company believes that the 1% rise in like-for-like sales, which excludes new stores, in the first six months is \"significantly above the market average\". Sales in June were up 7% on a like-for-like basis and 6% in July when overall retail sales as measured by the ONS were up 1.8%. Mr Lockyer said: \"Our sales figures for the first six months vindicate our decision not to discount prices this summer as early as some of our competitors.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
