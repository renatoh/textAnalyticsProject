The Windsor MP was accused of being \"negligent\" in claiming \u00a390,000 in a parliamentary allowance that he was not entitled to. Mr Trend apologised to the Commons this afternoon. He said he accepted \"unreservedly the committee's report which finds me muddled and naive in my negligent understanding of the additional costs allowance\". He went on: \"I apologise, again, unreservedly to you, Mr Speaker, to the house and to my constituents. I am so very sorry.\" The brief statement came shortly after the publication of the committee's report which cleared him of any suggestions of deliberately trying to rip off the public. But it found he had breached the code of conduct over his unwarranted claims for allowances, and consequently recommended a ban. MPs will have to vote on a suspension, but Mr Trend has already said he will step down at the next election, made a personal statement to explain his position. The report followed an investigation into how Mr Trend, a former frontbench spokesman, incorrectly claimed property allowances from 1993 until the discrepancy came to light last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
