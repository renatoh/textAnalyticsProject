Widdop was the biggest winner from this facile but entertaining romp against a denuded France team, eclipsing even the Wigan scrum half Sam Tomkins, who became the seventh player to score four tries in a match for England. In doing so he was also the first man to achieve the feat since Martin Offiah in 1996, and joined a distinguished list going back to the revered Wigan wing Jim Leytham in 1905. Steve McNamara's decision to summon the Halifax-born full-back from Melbourne\u2013 where he emigrated with his family as a teenager \u2013 for his first match as the England coach was emphatically justified as Widdop struck up an instant understanding with Tomkins, one which offers rich promise for the future. \"He's an easy bloke to play with, and good around the camp,\" Tomkins said of the newcomer, who scored the game's opening try with his first touch and was involved in the build-up to three more. \"He might not have had much first-team rugby before, but that's only because he's at Melbourne Storm with Billy Slater in front of him.\" The salary cap scandal that has engulfed Melbourne this season had encouraged several of Super League's leading clubs to make inquiries about Widdop's availability, even before this performance. He is now certain to receive offers that will further test his stated desire to stay with Slater at the Storm, at least until the end of his contract next year. Meanwhile, his place in England's squad for the Four Nations series in Australia and New Zealand at the end of this season must now be assured. McNamara did not quite guarantee it on Saturday night, pointing out that \"we've also got a lot of strong candidates in this country\". But the prospect of Widdop linking with a half-back partnership of Tomkins and Kyle Eastmond, will surely prove irresistible. On this unreliable evidence the availability of Sean O'Loughlin and continued development of Sam Burgess should make England's pack even more formidable than it was in more than holding its own last autumn, and Chris Bridge provides some much-needed craft to the three quarters. But the other major lesson to be taken from this game was the need to devise a more challenging mid-season fixture than France can currently provide, at least when so many of their players are injured. The argument for an All Stars team to be selected from the many overseas players in the Super League is becoming increasingly difficult for the clubs to resist.
