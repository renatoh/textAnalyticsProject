On the way it takes in no fewer than eight churches dedicated to St Hilda, a fine Yorkshire \u201ctrod\u201d \u2013 a stone pannierway indented by medieval wayfarers and their packhorses \u2013 and stepping stones over the River Esk at Lealholm.

Saint Augustine\u2019s Camino, Kent You\u2019ve got to respect a pilgrimage route that has the audacity to treat Canterbury not as a destination but as a mere staging post. The newly devised, 70-mile St Augustine\u2019s Camino \u2013 a guidebook and pilgrim\u2019s passport were launched this year \u2013 sets out from Rochester Cathedral bound for Augustus Pugin\u2019s recently renovated St Augustine shrine in Ramsgate.

It may be a journey of just 23 miles but it crosses three mountain ranges as it doglegs through west Cork. An added challenge is the distinct lack of accommodation along the way. So prepare yourself for a very long day, or make a diversion to Ballylickey on the coast. Further information pilgrimpath.ie Getting there From Cork, take the 236 bus to Drimoleague. Walk 4 miles from the end to Ballingeary for the 233 bus back to Cork. Where to stay Eagle Point Camping in Ballylickey (\u20ac12pp, eaglepointcamping.com).

Though sometimes incorporated into walks from northern Europe to Santiago de Compostela, it works as a discrete pilgrimage. Passing the spa town of Bad M\u00fcnstereifel and the former Benedictine abbey at Pr\u00fcm, it ends at Trier\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Cathedral. This happens to be the oldest church in Germany, commissioned by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century (though since destroyed and rebuilt).

Where to stay Treat yourself to a night at the modern but stylish Boutique Hotel Marielle in Bad M\u00fcnstereifel (doubles from \u20ac90 roon-only, hotel-marielle.de). St Henry\u2019s Way, Finland It\u2019s a little-known fact that the first incident in Finnish history that was written down occurred on 20 January 1156, when Bishop Henry was murdered by a yeoman named Lalli on the ice of Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi. The tiny wooded island of Kirkkokari, near the scene of the crime, has attracted pilgrims ever since.

Passing through the North Tirol, pilgrims follow in the footsteps of St Romedius, a young man who gave up his well-to-do life to meditate in a cave. He is said to have made the journey astride a bear, which for some reason became tame after killing his horse.

Banneux, Belgium Having the Virgin Mary appear to you once would be something, but in 1933 a girl called Mariette Beco claimed to have had eight encounters. She said the Virgin had shown her a spring with curative powers. By 1949, so many reports of healings had been made that the site received the imprimatur of the Catholic church.

For over 1,000 years pilgrims have trodden this path, which was once the main route from northern to southern Europe. With the Pilgrims\u2019 Passport (\u20ac5), their modern counterparts have access to a huge number of cheap-and-cheerful lodgings along the way.
