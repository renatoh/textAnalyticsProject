The language is reminiscent of the Theresa May era and appears to suggest the Conservatives have pivoted away from Boris Johnson\u2019s promise weeks ago of a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d deal and are now back to close alignment with the EU \u2013 something Eurosceptics are vehemently against. Can a comprehensive deal be done by the end of 2020? The majority of commentators think this is highly unlikely, but the answer depends on the definition of a trade deal. Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, is one who believes it is possible. \u201cThe single biggest underpriced thing in this whole debate about Brexit is that Johnson and the EU might actually get a trade deal done by 31 December 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I am pushing this as a likelihood, I just think it\u2019s possible and it could catch people off-guard.\u201d He said Johnson\u2019s target was clear and simple: to extricate the UK from the single market and customs union, without much regard for the barriers to trade it would create. The EU could move quickly to get such a deal done. However, others think Johnson, if he wins a majority, will pivot to a deal that aligns the UK with the EU far more closely than he has said to date. \u201cI think Johnson will come under enormous pressure to extend the transition period and I think he will,\u201d said one well-connected former senior civil servant. \u201cThe worry for him without a transition extension is to risk getting a really bad deal after having \u2018got Brexit done\u2019.\u201d What would an \u2018ambitious, deep and comprehensive\u2019 trade deal look like? Theresa May talked of \u201cthe broadest and deepest possible partnership, covering more sectors and cooperating more fully than any free-trade agreement anywhere in the world today\u201d. Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law, told a recent select committee hearing that it was unlikely a full deal could be achieved by the end of 2020 but it might be possible to conclude a single strand of trade talks. \u201cIt may well be that you see a series of agreements staggered over time, and the easier one to conclude would be on goods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is in the EU\u2019s interest to have an agreement on goods quickly, because the EU has a trade surplus with the UK in goods.\u201d Would this be enough to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019? Any deal would be likely to be good for the Conservatives. The leave campaign\u2019s mission was \u201ctaking back control\u201d. Would there be another cliff-edge? Yes. Lowe predicts that having got Brexit done, the Conservatives would seek to \u201cphase in\u201d arrangements to cushion the economic shock and disruption for business. \u201cYou would start with the status quo in 2021 and phase in the new arrangements,\u201d Lowe said. This would be mean a transition or implementation period that could last years. What would happen to the rest of Brexit if the only deal at the end of 2020 is on goods? A security deal is also expected. But agreements are needed on a whole range of other issues: regulatory standards, mutual recognition of qualifications, defence, the Galileo satellite system, travel, transport, haulage, the rights of British nationals in the EU, reciprocal health and social welfare arrangements, continued cooperation on research and development in science, medicine and education. If a rushed approach is pursued, Lowe expects the EU will make the deal contingent on an institutional framework agreement being signed simultaneously. This would be an overarching arrangement that could enable talks to continue on other strands but with broad agreement on areas such as justice and home affairs, research cooperation and security and defence. The danger is that this could tie up negotiations for years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
