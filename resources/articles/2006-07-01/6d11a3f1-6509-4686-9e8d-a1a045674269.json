The study, commissioned by the UN development programme, predicts that if the spread of the virus is unchecked more than 16 million people will be infected by 2016, with economic growth slowing by almost a percentage point a year. After China, India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world. In the past three months its national wealth rose 9.3%. The paper's author, Prasanta Pradhan of Delhi's National Council of Applied Economic Research, said extra spending on health by the government and the increased medical bills of the families affected would lead to a fall in national savings. This would mean less money for investment and a draining away of economic growth. The report also makes clear that Aids could severely reduce the labour force of the future, with tourism, construction, textiles and mining all industries most at risk of being hit by a lack of workers. India is already home to the largest population living with HIV. Some 5.7 million Indians have the virus, overtaking South Africa, which has 5.5 million, this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
