One of them later contributes a diary to the Guardian, in which they lament \u201cbasically losing one my friends from Wuhan to his Fifa addiction\u201d and enjoying \u201ca banging bacon and sausage sandwich\u201d for breakfast each morning. For now, life carries on as normal for everyone else in the UK. People in Britain start dying \u2013 28 February A passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan becomes the first Briton to die of Covid-19. Suddenly, the virus seems a little closer to home. Six days later the UK records its first death on home soil, when a woman in her 70s dies in hospital in Berkshire, prompting the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman to say it is \u201chighly likely the virus is going to spread in a significant way\u201d. Toilet paper wars begin \u2013 8 March UK supermarkets start rationing toilet paper after Public Health England urges members of the public to \u201cplan ahead\u201d in case they have to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. People translate this into: must stockpile loo roll. And pasta. And tinned tomatoes. It starts to become difficult to book an online grocery delivery slot. The Guardian finds one UK-based seller who had earned \u00a31,000 from selling large packs of Andrex toilet roll at \u00a350 each \u2013 more than double the retail price. Nadine Dorries tests positive \u2013 10 March Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister, becomes the first MP to test positive, prompting speculation that the disease might have spread across the Houses of Parliament. After Dorries recovers, she tweets to say: \u201cHaving lived through coronavirus, can I assure everyone that at no time during the seven days we were in isolation at home did we even once have to face a secondary crisis and run out of loo roll.\u201d Boris Johnson changes gear \u2013 16 March After several weeks in which the government appeared to have played down the severity of the virus, Boris Johnson suddenly changes gear. In a live televised address he tells the nation to avoid all non-essential social contact, stop \u201cunnecessary\u201d visits to care homes and to work from home. A study from Imperial College\u2019s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis has prompted the about-turn, after it warned the government that its \u201cmitigation strategy\u201d would lead to 260,000 deaths. That would be not just deaths from the virus, but from other illnesses that the NHS would be too hard-pressed to treat. Two days later the UK closes all schools except to the children of key workers. Full lockdown begins \u2013 23 March Johnson announces wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law. He orders a ban on gatherings of more than two people and tells the British public: \u201cYou must stay at home.\u201d With a sombre expression, he decrees that people will only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary. Lockdown begins. Volunteer army of 750,000 recruited in 24 hours \u2013 24 March The NHS puts out a call for a \u201cvolunteer army\u201d to help up to 1.5 million people who have been asked to shield themselves from coronavirus because of underlying health conditions. Within 24 hours, 750,000 people have put their names forward, offering to do simple but vital tasks such as delivering medicines from pharmacies; driving patients to appointments; and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home. Millions around the UK clap for the NHS \u2013 26 March At 8pm, millions of people around the UK stand at their front doors and open windows, in gardens and on balconies, to sound a round of national applause for those working on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus. Children bang on pots and pans, dogs bark, and handbells ring out. Boats sound their horns across Bristol harbour, while in Oban the high school pipe band add their skirl to the chorus of thanks. Boy, 13, dies alone in London hospital \u2013 30 March Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, 13, from Brixton, south London, becomes the first child to die from coronavirus in the UK. His life ends alone in King\u2019s College hospital, three days after he tested positive for Covid-19. His family say they do not think he had any underlying health issues. They are unable to attend his funeral after two of his six siblings begin displaying symptoms of the virus. Johnson goes into intensive care \u2013 6 April Downing Street announces that the prime minister has been taken into intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, 10 days after he first self-isolated following a positive test for coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
