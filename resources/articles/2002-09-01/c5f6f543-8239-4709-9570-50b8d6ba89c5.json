Her illness began as a university student. Feelings of insecurity at being away from home, inadequacy with social interaction, especially with the opposite sex, feelings of perfectionism and a need to prove herself all found an outlet in a diet that began with the aim of making herself more attractive and quickly mutated into a means of imposing control on her life. Chisholm is, as you would expect, articulate in her analysis of her own experience, citing the expectations of her close-knit religious family (her father was a vicar) of what a 'woman' should be, together with her own reluctance to accept the trappings of womanhood, as contributing factors without seeking to shift the blame. She also draws on other women's memoirs of anorexia, together with historical and scientific accounts of the illness, which gives the book a literary flavour, and at times her recollection of events is novelistic in its descriptions, reminiscent of the recent trend for confessional memoirs that read like fiction. Perhaps the book's brevity is to its disadvantage, because the author doesn't seem quite sure if it is to be a brutally honest account of personal pain, or a more generalised study with a literary bent. It leans more towards the soul-baring memoir, but she does tend to keep the reader at a safe distance even in her most honest moments. As with many such memoirs, however, the author's intended readership is first and foremost those who will identify with her experience and have perhaps feared that they were alone in their feelings. In this respect she has written a brave and necessary book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
