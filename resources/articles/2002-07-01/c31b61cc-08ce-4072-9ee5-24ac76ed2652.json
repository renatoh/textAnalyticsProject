Scrape together whatever you can, raid the kids' piggy bank, put your grandmother up for auction and pump the proceeds into putts. Yup, putts. Worth a fortune by all accounts and in great demand in this neck of the forest at least. Certainly Tiger Woods, with all his squillions, could not buy one yesterday. A hint of charity from Lady Luck, the merest smile even, and the galaxy's premier golfer, city-slick in his white, black and grey coordinates, would probably be sitting atop the leaderboard instead of lurking, albeit threateningly, in the pack. According to Woods, any sub-par round in the Open - in the red numbers, as they say - represents a decent day at the office (four of them, he reckons, and you are in with a shout of lifting the claret jug) and by that token the man seeking his third major championship this year should have finished his myriad post-round interviews and tootled off to his digs a satisfied man. Offer him a 70, one under par, before the day had started and no doubt he would have taken it and snuggled back under the duvet rather than spend the nicest part of the day working for it. Yet it could have been so much better, because Woods for the most part played beautifully efficient, organised golf from tee to green, adhering like Araldite to a game plan that involved hitting his driver only three times, hitting greens and leaving himself birdie opportunity after opportunity. Muirfield defended itself yesterday, though not with the wind - which will come later, we are told - nor even the rough, the tendrils of which were largely taken out of the equation for those playing well and hitting long irons from the tee, but with the pin placements. The greens are rolling affairs, full of swales and hollows, lumps and bumps and breaks both subtle and sledgehammer- obvious. In less benign conditions holes would be cut in kinder locations, not found on the top of small hillocks so that putts would break to either side if not hit perfectly. \"It was certainly hard to fire at the pins,\" said Woods. \"A lot of them were tucked on knobs and they are not only hard to get to, they are hard to read as well.\" The relatively slow pace of the greens, not helped by the rain earlier in the week, also proved to be a problem for players who are used to greased lightning. \"They are slower than we normally play week after week,\" Woods said, \"but they have to have them like that because if the wind should blow they could lose control [and balls would not stay still on the greens]. Downhill, down-grain they can roll but uphill into the grain you have to rip it. \"It was frustrating in the sense that I was hitting beautiful putts and lipping out maybe six or seven times. If they had dropped, it would have been a pretty good round.\" On the face of it, though, it was a day made for low scoring. As Woods and his entourage of minders, police and officials arrived at the 1st tee, there was scarcely sufficient wind to send a shimmer through the acres of knee-high rough (\"Never mind the prize money, just give me the hay concession,\" the American Doug Sanders had quipped here in 1966, and you knew what he meant). The quiet was reverential too, as Woods took his two-iron from the bag and settled down over his ball. Then it happened. There is a golden rule for photographers, that they do not shoot until the ball has been struck. Kerchung, kerchung. One trigger-happy snapper released a volley so that Woods pulled away from his shot and snapped back angrily. \"Haven't you guys taken enough freakin' pictures yet?\" That the same photographer should repeat his action as Woods finally hit his opening shot was unforgivable, the result being that someone will be without pictures for the rest of the championship and Woods found himself 30 yards off line and up to his neck in the rough with the ball all but invisible. \"When I saw my lie I was telling myself that if I made double bogey I was doing well. The idea was just to try and hit it as hard as I could with my 60-degree wedge, move it forward and hope for a better lie in the rough for my next,\" he said. \"I could have hit it a foot, but it came out great. I do not know how I did it but I did.\" Then, for good measure, he wedged to six feet and holed the putt for one of the least likely pars he will ever make. Four hours later, after he had coaxed a tricky downhill chip close on the final hole and tapped in for par, he had added birdies at the 560-yard 5th, which he reached with a drive and a two-iron, another at the 9th, a shorter par five covered with a pair of four-irons, and at the par-four 11th, where his two-iron from the tee was followed by a steepling nine-iron which bombed the pin and rolled to six feet. Mistakes came only at the 6th, where he three-putted from 20ft, the second putt horseshoeing the hole, and at the 10th, where he drove into the rough and came up short with his second. \"Frustrating,\" said Woods. \"That's not the way to have it happen at all.\" Not for him, maybe, but he should try being human. Hole-by-hole tale of Woods' patchy putting 1st: 4 shots (par 4) Disturbed on tee and hits iron into rough. Chops back on to fairway, hits approach to six feet and holes for par. 2nd: 4 (4) Slightly wayward iron but kind bounce back on to fairway. Wedge to seven feet but birdie putt lips out. 3rd: 4 (4) On in two after taking iron off tee. Second to about 10 feet but leaves putt inches short. 4th: 3 (3) Six-iron to 15 feet but putt veers away late for a tap-in. 5th: 4 (5) Driver to middle of fairway, finds green with two-iron. Rolls huge first putt to eight inches and taps in birdie putt. 6th: 5 (4) Two-iron into middle of fairway and second to 20 feet. Putts past hole and then misses two-footer back. 7th: 3 (3) Tee shot to 10 feet but pulls putt to left, leaving a tap-in. 8th: 4 (4) Two-iron to centre of fairway, hits approach to 30 feet and shaves cup to leave six-incher. 9th: 4 (5) Four-iron off tee and four-iron second from 257 yards. Long first putt leaves tap-in. 10th: 5 (4) Driver finds rough on right. Chips back but leaves wedge 15 feet short on edge of green. Putt pulls up short. 11th: 3 (4) Two-iron followed by a nine-iron; sinks birdie putt from six feet. 12th: 4 (4) On the green in two but 12-foot birdie putt lips out. 13th: 3 (3) Finds the green but 35-foot birdie putt is six inches short. 14th: 4 (4) Hits approach from centre of fairway to within 15 feet but misses putt. 15th: 4 (4) Iron off tee leaves tough second to difficult pin position on back edge. Two putts. 16th: 3 (3) Six-iron to 15 feet and two putts. 17th: 5 (5) Hits driver into rough, but good lie and superb second puts him back into ideal position. Strikes wedge to 12 feet but putt shaves hole. 18th: 4 (4) Iron finds middle of fairway but hits second through back. Chips to two feet and holes putt to finish one under par. Total score: 70 (par 71)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
