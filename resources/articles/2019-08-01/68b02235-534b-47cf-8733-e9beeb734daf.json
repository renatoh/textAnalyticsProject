The trainer\u2019s comments came despite the British Horseracing Authority stating on Monday that the Festival\u2019s four-day format will continue. The BHA had announced a new race, the Mares\u2019 Chase, for 2021 but said that it would replace an existing contest not yet selected. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen overnight, but I am surprised it is not five days already. I think it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d said Bailey, who trains at Andoversford near Cheltenham. \u201cYes, it may dilute the Festival but there are pressures, commercial pressures, and I think it will happen.\u201d Any move to stretch the Festival to a Saturday would face widespread opposition. But there were also protests before it was extended from three days to four in 2005. The York Ebor meeting remains at four days, but Glorious Goodwood is five \u2013 as is Royal Ascot since it swallowed up the track\u2019s Heath meeting in 2002. Ireland\u2019s Punchestown Festival is five, while Galway is seven. The BHA\u2019s addition of a new race for mares in 2021, along with safety-inspired changes to next year\u2019s four-mile National Hunt Chase, have been welcomed. Commercial interests may see an opportunity down the line to push for further new races and adding a Saturday to the mid-March \u201cjumping Olympics\u201d. Oliver Sherwood, another Cheltenham Festival-winning trainer, said on Monday: \u201cI\u2019m against any such move if it came, against any watering-down of the Festival. It would be an absolute disaster. Leave it at four days. It must be quality over quantity.\u201d Told that the top Irish trainer Noel Meade had also voiced opposition to any extension, Sherwood added: \u201cPerhaps we are old school, but we think it\u2019s excellent as it is.\u201d Venetia Williams, who has a fine Festival record as a trainer, said: \u201cI would not be a fan of any extension. It would mean spreading the action more thinly, and to risk reducing quality.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s racing tips Stormbomber (7.40) was heavily backed at Kempton nine days ago but came up against what could be a useful sort in Mutasaamy. The winner had to be ridden right out, so Stormbomber\u2019s run into second place is form that can see him home in front this time at the same track. Earlier, Marie Perrault partners Stay Forever (4.50) in an apprentice riders\u2019 race at Salisbury. The partnership was successful at Sandown a fortnight ago when Perrault displayed skill with last-to-first tactics. The duo can win again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
