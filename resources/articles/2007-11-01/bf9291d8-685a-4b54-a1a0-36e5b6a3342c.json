They say the real funding gap ministers and civil servants should be addressing is \u00a37bn wide, and separates the relatively small amount of our money ministers bestow on those aged 19 and over in further education, compared with what they allocate to those in higher education. This gap has been brought into sharp relief by the creation of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Dius).Now that responsibility for funding 16- to 19-year-olds is to pass from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities, a stark comparison is exposed between the \u00a32.9bn the LSC passes on for teaching skills to adults and the \u00a310.3bn handed over for adult higher education. What the report's authors, Mark Corney and Mick Fletcher, highlight is an official mindset that seems prepared to allow much more lavish use of public money for people doing higher education than for those picking up skills in further education, despite the current drive to try to persuade adults to improve their skills. \"Permanent or not, the housing of LSC adult skills funding within Dius raises the spectre of adult skills being swamped by higher education,\" says the report. It points out that while there is a distinction made in LSC funding for over-19s between adult education and adult skills, no such distinction is made in the money handed over for higher education. While LSC funding must underpin \"economically relevant qualifications\", higher education institutions are allowed to determine the degrees the Higher Education Funding Council (Hefce) supports. \"Clearly a common language is required to make appropriate choices between public investment in adult education, adult skills, higher education and higher skills,\" says the report, which was commissioned by the education charity CfBT. \"We cannot develop a system that smacks of education for the best and skills for the rest.\" According to the report, the historic bias towards higher education was \"reinforced\" within a fortnight of Dius's existence. On July 5, it announced an additional \u00a3400m for grants for full-time higher education students from next year, and four days later, \u00a320m for a national skills campaign. There are 1.3m Hefce-funded university students, 815,000 of them full-time. In LSC-funded adult FE there are 2.3 million students, 160,000 of them full-time. Full-time higher education students get 86% or \u00a34.1bn of HE funding from Hefce. Fee and maintenance grants of nearly \u00a31bn are available to them, but only \u00a3100m is available for full-time adult FE students, including \u00a335m for Adult Learner Grants. In further education about 70% of tuition and financial support funding goes to part-time students and the rest to full-timers. Though Dius is built around LSC adult skills as well as higher education student and research funding, 84% of the total \u00a318.7bn funding goes to higher education. \"Dius looks like a department for universities,\" says the report. \"The vast bulk of its funding will go to universities and HE students rather than FE colleges, let alone work-based providers.\" What to do about this? In 2009, there is to be a higher education funding review. This should now be turned into an adult skills and higher education funding review, say Corney and Fletcher. The report suggests that the \"big idea\" would be to merge the LSC with Hefce to form an Adult Skills and Higher Education Funding Council. But this, it stresses, would have to come up with a new way of funding adult skills and higher education based on common and fair principles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
