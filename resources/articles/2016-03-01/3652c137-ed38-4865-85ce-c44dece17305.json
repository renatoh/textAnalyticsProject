The list, released under the Freedom of Information Act, reveals that police and security personnel from 79 countries are expected to attend Security &amp; Policing, a Home Office-sponsored fair held in Farnborough, Hampshire. They include delegations from Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, countries whose human rights records have come under intense scrutiny over the way their security forces have responded to a wave of public protests following the Arab spring. The sale of non-lethal weapons and surveillance equipment is becoming a growth area for UK companies. Since David Cameron took office in 2010, the UK has approved 126 licences relating to the sale of tear gas and irritants, according to figures compiled by the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT). The government has also approved 259 licences for anti-riot/ballistic shields, 79 for \u201cacoustic devices for riot control\u201d and 75 for crowd control ammunition. The issuing of the licences is controversial. In recent years, UK-produced equipment has been linked to crackdowns and human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Bahrain, Egypt and Kuwait. \u201cThere are serious questions to be asked about the impact of the so-called \u2018non-lethal\u2019 arms industry,\u201d said Andrew Smith of CAAT. \u201cThese risks become even more important when these weapons are being sold to human rights abusers and dictatorships. \u201cA number of the countries in attendance routinely practise torture, arbitrary detention and other appalling acts of violence. The UK should not be arming these regimes and selling them the means to oppress and kill.\u201d Unlike other major defence fairs, the Farnborough event makes a virtue of the fact that it is taking place behind closed doors. Its website explains: \u201cSecurity &amp; Policing ... enables exhibitors to display products which would be too sensitive to show in a more open environment.\u201d The event will have zones focusing on \u201cpolice innovation\u201d, \u201ccyber security\u201d, \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201cborder controls\u201d. Delegations from overseas police and security forces will be escorted around the event by civil servants from the government\u2019s arms sales unit, the UK Trade and Investment Defence and Security Organisation, which is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Last year the fair attracted 375 exhibitors, including weapons manufacturers and surveillance companies. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \u201cA thriving security industry is vital to help cut crime and protect the public and so it is important these products and services can be showcased and expertise shared.\u201d But CAAT\u2019s Smith countered that the event \u201cundermines the UK\u2019s claims to be promoting human rights while strengthening the position of repressive regimes\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
