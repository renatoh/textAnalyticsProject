Everton's manager had cast doubt on his future in recent months by claiming he would not extend his six-year spell without guarantees that he could compete with the likes of Aston Villa, Portsmouth, Manchester City and Spurs in this summer's market. Moyes, who has one year on his contract and has also said he would still be in the job at the start of next season, met Kenwright late last week to discuss terms and possible transfer targets. A deal has been agreed in principle and the Scot, whose weekly wage is expected to rise from \u00a340,000 to more than \u00a350,000, will sign once the legalities are complete. He has been promised funds for at least one high-calibre signing and although the length of the contract is unconfirmed, Moyes recently presented a five-year strategy to the board that involved challenging for Champions League qualification on a regular basis and playing in a new or redeveloped stadium. The former Liverpool reserve and now France international Alou Diarra, an \u00a38m-rated central midfielder with Bordeaux, is on their radar. Moyes' need to recruit central midfielders increased yesterday when Lee Carsley announced he is joining Birmingham City, subject to medical, after more than six years. The 34-year-old has just completed another busy campaign, with only Phil Neville and Joleon Lescott starting more games, and had been offered a one-year deal. However, he is keen to move closer to his home in the Midlands. He also had interest from Derby and West Bromwich. \"I've left a club that's going to be playing in the Uefa Cup again next season, so it's not something I've done lightly,\" Carsley said. \"We finished fifth in the league, so realistically I wasn't going to go to any of the teams above them and I couldn't see the point of going to any of the teams below them. I feel I've done the next best thing and joined a club that's building and trying to get where Everton are.\" Another possible departure could be Andrew Johnson, with West Ham considering a renewed bid. The Hammers failed with a \u00a315m move for the England man 12 months ago and despite recent assertions by Johnson that he has no interest in leaving, Alan Curbishley may test the former Crystal Palace forward's resolve again. Everton's defender Joseph Yobo, meanwhile, has been cleared to start next season after an administrative error at the Nigerian Football Association. Samson Siasia, the coach, who did include their young striker Victor Anichebe in his Olympic squad, said: \"Our secretary forgot to include Yobo's name in our preliminary squad, so he won't be going, which is Everton's gain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
