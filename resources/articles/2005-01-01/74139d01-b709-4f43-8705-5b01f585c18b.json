And, despite the FA's increasingly desperate propaganda ever since, the half-empty stadiums tomorrow will surely tell their own story: the FA Cup doesn't matter anymore. Well, at least not until the semi-finals. So it's curious to report, then, that five years after shamelessly decamping for Fifa's World Club Championship, United seem to be taking the competition seriously again. Well, seriously enough to name a full-strength squad - minus the injured Alan Smith and suspended Roy Keane - for Middlesbrough tomorrow. And they're not the only ones, with even a straight-faced Arsene Wenger insisting today: \"I take the FA Cup seriously. Thierry Henry will start against Wolves, as will Patrick Vieira.\" But in the serious stakes, Newcastle manager Graeme Souness surely takes some beating. When asked an innocent question about Craig Bellamy's prospects of a runaround against Coventry, he thundered: \"He can't play for me ever again. He can't go on TV and accuse me of telling lies. I'm not going to dwell on it,\" he added, before doing just that (at some length) before concluding: \"But it's a healthier club now.\" Newcastle fans will be hoping he's still saying that come tomorrow night. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY \"He's the best player ever to come out of Brazil\" - Adilson Batista Prado, president of Brazilian outfit Associacao Desportiva Atletica, does his best to avoid putting too much pressure on his club's star midfielder, one Jean Carlos Chera, who is being watched by Man United. And is nine years old. ********************* SEVERAL THOUSAND YEAR'S WORTH OF FIVER WAGES DOWN THE DRAIN IN ONE SEASON If it weren't for the employees of Omsky Bekon, Siberia's largest pork processor, spending all hours of the day shoving lumps of pig into clingfilm, the exclusive news in Lahn's E'ning Stannah that Chelsea operated at a loss of about \u00a360m last season might have wiped the goofy grin off Roman Abramovich's goofy face. Fortunately (well, not that fortunately for those currently elbow-deep in offal), they do, so all the billionaire need do is make a mental note not to take the Boeing 767 out for a spin for a while. Yes, the Blues made losses last time out that would have had even Peter Ridsdale breaking out in weeping hives, with wage and transfer bills of [Fiver ducks away to get figures from nearby City type] \u00a3115m. Not only that, but they spent a further \u00a3110m on players in summer 2003. Fortunately, with Peter Kenyon oozing his way along back corridors making big-money deals hither and thither, and Roman owning billions of roubles worth of Russian industry like those luckless loin luggers, the losses are only marginally more inconvenient than Joe Cole. Mind you, one thing money can't buy (a decent haircut for poor Joe aside), is a break from the pesky FA. The sun may have tiptoed away from its usual spot and taken up residence in Jose Mourinho's pants of late, but the FA's disciplinary suits are steadfastly hanging onto their Ray-Bans and have charged him with improper conduct for suggesting cheating went on in the Manchester United camp during their League Cup semi-final first leg with Chelsea. Valentine's Day is his last opportunity to respond, until when Portugal's finest vineyards will be on full alert. ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF They probably won't need one against Livingston tomorrow, but Rangers have to find a new goalkeeper soon because Stefan Klos has hurt knee ligaments in training and will be out for the rest of the season. Also missing for the rest of the season is Birmingham's David Dunn, who broke down in training with a recurring hamstring problem. Walter Smith has named his first Scotland squad and handed international recalls to veteran duo Neil Sullivan and David Weir. Full squad: Douglas (Celtic), Gordon (Hearts), Marshall (Celtic), Sullivan (Leeds), Anderson (Aberdeen), Caldwell (Hibernian), McNamara (Celtic), McNamee (Livingston), Naysmith (Everton), Pressley (Hearts), Webster (Hearts), Weir (Everton), Dailly (West Ham), Shortbread McFiver (Fiver Towers), Ferguson (Blackburn), Fletcher (Man Utd), Hartley (Hearts), McCann (Southampton), Quashie (Southampton), Crawford (Dundee), Dickov (Blackburn), McFadden (Everton), Miller (Wolves), O'Connor (Hibernian), Riordan (Hibernian), Thompson (Rangers). * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Premier League Preview Show (7pm) We asked you to share your workplace woes to see if crafty Fiver readers couldn't help resolve them.
