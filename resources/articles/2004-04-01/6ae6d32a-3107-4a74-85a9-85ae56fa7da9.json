The report, by the programme's respected political editor Elinor Goodman, suggests that the prime minister's inner circle is trying to quash speculation that Mr Blair plans to stand down after the referendum on the European constitution. Ms Goodman described her source as a senior minister close to the prime minister. Her report will disappoint supporters of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, who is seen as the likeliest successor to Mr Blair should he choose to step down. The relationship between the two men has been dogged with rumours that Mr Blair promised Mr Brown that he would one day hand the keys of No 10 over to him if he stood aside in the 1994 Labour leadership election. Recent events - the continued violence in Iraq, public unease about asylum and the row over whether to hold a referendum on the proposed European constitution - have added to the speculation about Mr Blair's intentions. No 10 hopes that the prime minister's recent u-turn on the referendum and \"top to bottom\" review of immigration controls will help bring closure to what has been seen as one of the most difficult periods of his premiership. The report that Mr Blair intends to carry on in office for longer than Mrs Thatcher may, however, infuriate those in the Labour party who, like former Cabinet minister Clare Short, want to see an \"elegant succession\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
