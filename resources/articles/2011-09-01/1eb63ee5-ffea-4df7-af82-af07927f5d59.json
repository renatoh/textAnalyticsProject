But at Samantha Cameron's Downing Street reception for the fashion industry, the American Vogue editor's entrance on the arm of a hulking bodyguard was comprehensively overshadowed by that of Florence Cameron, who made a cameo appearance on the hip of her babysitter, who also happens to be the prime minister. Wintour, famously, never stays at a party longer than 20 minutes. Florence, along with her older brother and sister, made her excuses after 15. Game, set and match to the MiniCams. The question on everyone's lips was, of course, what is she wearing? In the case of Samantha Cameron, the answer was self-evident: anyone unable to recognise at 20 paces a key look from Jonathan Saunders autumn 2011 collection would have been immediately ejected from last night's party as an imposter. From Florence, however, a straight answer was not so easy to extract, since even the most well-brought-up 13-month-olds have disappointingly little in the way of cocktail party chit -chat. The smart money had Florence in White Company, Arthur in Gap Kids and Nancy in Boden, though at press time the Minister for Pyjamas was not returning calls. Bailey, the designer of Burberry, arrived early in order to have a good look at the Downing Street art collection. He is a particular fan of Stanley Spencer whose painting, Peonies, is currently on display on the ground floor of No 10. Jane Bruton, the editor of Grazia, was pleased to note that Gordon Brown's portrait had been added to the hall of prime ministerial fame that is the lemon-yellow staircase. A new Tracey Emin commission, a neon tube spelling the words \"More Passion\", now hangs above the entrance to the reception area. At the now regular Downing Street receptions for fashion, Samantha Cameron is unique in being both genuinely at home in the surroundings \u2013 what with living there \u2013 and entirely au fait with the gossip. She congratulated designers whose shows she had seen, while confidently debating contrasting brand-building strategies in evidence among the designers and the strictly off-the-record matter of whose star is on the wane and whose on the rise. While David Cameron's three young children gave him an excuse for an early exit, George Osborne's small talk on the subjects of taffeta, Grace Kelly and the likelihood of Miuccia Prada embracing the 1950s this season was put to rigorous test. Jeremy Hunt, in an Aquascutum suit with a London 2012 badge, was keen to stress the importance of fashion: \"We need to start talking about what is great about contemporary Britain, and fashion is important in that. It's that mix of ancient and modern excellence that is unique about Britain.\" The canape trays \u2013 a subliminal assault of miniature yorkshire puddings, coins of beef, venison pies, shavings of root vegetables and morsels of sea bass \u2013 endeavoured to drive home Hunt's message. As the champagne flowed, the party began to divide, as parties will, into factions. The lemon drawing room, where the speeches were made, was for CEOs \u2013 it was here that the past and present guises of Marks &amp; Spencer met, as Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland exchanged pleasantries, and where retail moguls (Philip Green) and the seriously wealthy and well-dressed (Heather Kerzner) hung out. The salmon pink sitting room next door, meanwhile, was the place to be for the designers, stylists and It kids. (\"This lot are the people who dance in the kitchen at parties,\" as one famous British model put it.) But Downing Street is a great leveller. As Stuart Rose put it last night, \"This is the centre of power in this country \u2013 and everyone loves going where the power is.\" Sam Baker, editor of Red magazine, noted how the shared excitement made accessible human beings of even the most aired-and-graced fashionistas. \"I love how happy everyone is to be here. Designers who can seem quite intimidating are very human in this context.\" Roksanda Ilincic arrived and was immediately gathered into a bear hug by fellow designer Jonathan Saunders, who squeezed her until she squealed and lavished praise on her collection. Neither of the above are normal practise in the cool world of fashion. Louise Wilson of Central St Martins was there \"to see all my old students\"; Marios Schwab, ex St Martins and now the name in the label of several expensive Downing Street cocktail frocks, was there \"to see Louise.\" Henry Holland was in a tie (leopardprint, by Paul Smith), while stylist Katy England, longtime collaborator of the late Lee McQueen, was resplendant in a black cocktail dress by Marios Schwab. \"I've never been invited before, and I was intrigued,\" she said. \"Although what my husband [Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie] thought of me coming here is entirely unrepeatable.\" Said Baker on Twitter: \"Everyone tries to get you to steal some loo paper. You have to explain that they get their loo paper the same place the rest of us do.\" But the imposing dimensions of Downing Street did, it seem, break through even the icy fashion demeanour. \"The big windows are fantastic,\" one mogul mused. \"Wouldn't this be a marvellous place for an after-show party?\" \u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2011.
