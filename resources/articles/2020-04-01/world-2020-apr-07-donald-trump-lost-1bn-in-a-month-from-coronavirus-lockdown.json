The US president\u2019s fortune has fallen from an estimated $3.1bn (\u00a32.5bn) on 1 March to $2.1bn on 18 March (at the height of stock market panic caused by the coronavirus pandemic) according to Forbes magazine\u2019s annual billionaires list. The Covid-19 induced collapse in global stock markets led to 267 of the world\u2019s richest people losing their billionaire status, in the magazine\u2019s 34th annual wealth ranking. There are now 2,095 dollar billionaires in the world \u2013 and a record 1,062 of them have lost money compared with last year. Among those who joined the billionaires\u2019 club is Eric Yuan, the founder of Silicon Valley video conferencing app Zoom. The magazine estimates that Yuan, who owns 20% of Zoom\u2019s shares, has a paper fortune of $5.5bn. The app has become hugely popular during the coronavirus lockdown as people around the world use it to keep in touch. Zoom has been used for everything from nursery school sing-alongs to FTSE 100 boardroom meertings and even UK Cabinet meetings. But Yuan was forced to apologise to users over misleading claims that it offers \u201cend-to-end encryption for all meetings\u201d. \u201cWe recognise that we have fallen short of the community\u2019s \u2013 and our own \u2013 privacy and security expectations,\u201d Yuan said in a blog post. \u201cFor that, I am deeply sorry.\u201d Amazon founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, maintained his standing as the world\u2019s richest person for the third consecutive year with a $113bn fortune. His total wealth estimated by Forbes slipped from $131bn last year. Amazon\u2019s shares have largely recovered from the stock market plunge as most of the company\u2019s services are still operating throughout the lockdown. Most of Trump\u2019s wealth comes from his real estate. His Trump Organization empire \u2013 which is managed by his sons Donald Jr and Eric \u2013 includes Trump Tower in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which the president likes to call his \u201cwinter White House\u201d). There are also more than a dozen hotels and golf courses, such as the Trump International Hotel above the Las Vegas strip and the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. World governments and many US states have forced the closure of all non-essential businesses across the world, leaving offices and hotels empty and golf courses deserted. The Trump Organization has closed 17 of its properties across the world, according to the Washington Post. Those that are still open are running skeleton services. About 1,500 Trump Organization staff have been laid off or furloughed, according to public filings reviewed by the newspaper. The closed properties generated about $650,000-a-day for the company, according to the president\u2019s previous financial disclosures. The Trump Organization last week sought guidance from Florida\u2019s Palm Beach county about whether it expected the company to continue making monthly payments on land it leases for a 27-hole golf club, the New York Times reported. Trump representatives have also reached out to Deutsche Bank, the company\u2019s largest creditor, about the possibility of postponing payments on some of its loans. Forbes said it calculated Trump\u2019s fortune by comparing it to the share price plunges experienced by stock market-listed real estate companies, which suffered average stock price declines of 37%. The magazine also compared Trump\u2019s hotel and golf businesses with listed hospitality companies, which have also suffered heavily in the stock market rout. Trump also owns 125,000 sq ft of retail space near Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It is normally one of the most profitable shopping areas in the world, but has been deserted for weeks due to the pandemic. Eric Anton, a New York property broker, said: \u201cThe [Forbes] analysis, it\u2019s as good as any other way I can think of [estimating Trump\u2019s wealth].\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 April 2020 to describe the location of the Trump International Hotel as \u201cabove the Las Vegas strip\u201d rather than on the strip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
