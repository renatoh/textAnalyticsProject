However, for those already made redundant it is too late. Tima Reshad, beauty salon owner, London Tima Reshad, 42, spoke to the Guardian on a busy Monday as her beauty salon customers anxiously sought to get their treatments before the new lockdown is imposed in England later this week. Reshad said 2020 was now harmed beyond repair, although she was relieved the furlough scheme protected her staff\u2019s livelihoods for the time being. \u201cWe missed out on the peak of our business this year, from April to July, and now we face missing the Christmas season,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re super busy now, everyone\u2019s frantically trying to get in \u2026 They\u2019re panicking about going into lockdown.\u201d As her work involves close contact, she doubts being able to reopen her Notting Hill-based business in December. \u201c2020 is a write-off business-wise for us,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s just a case of surviving. Forget trying to grow and advance, we\u2019ve had to adapt everything. It\u2019s also quite scary as you keep seeing more and more stalls and shops shutting on the high street and in shopping centres.\u201d However, her main concern is her staff being able to pay their bills. \u201cI just hope there\u2019s going to be a solution for this because how much longer is it going to carry on for,\u201d she asked. \u201cBut I\u2019m relieved because of furlough; without that it would\u2019ve been really stressful. I\u2019ll have to think of something for the other expenses.\u201d Ian Sivell, project manager, Basildon After taking voluntary redundancy a fortnight ago, Ian Sivell faces an uncertain two months before Christmas and fears his family could become destitute if he does not find a job during that time. Having been on furlough since April, Sivell, 52, said taking voluntary redundancy was his \u201conly option\u201d last month as the scheme approached its end. He is dismayed that the furlough scheme has now been extended. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here really quite angry about it all.\u201d The Essex-based father-of-three said he was worried about his future. The IT project manager said he feared he may never secure another job in a similar salary range after previously spending years out of work following the 2008 financial crash. \u201cA lot of people are facing the stark reality of redundancy and that\u2019s grim,\u201d he added. \u201cI joined my company four years ago fully expecting to see out my tenure there into retirement. Now I\u2019m sitting here wondering if I\u2019m going to find another job and the bills don\u2019t stop. I\u2019ll be destitute in a couple of months. My situation is indicative of a lot of people out there.\u201d Sivell said he will wait another couple of weeks before applying for universal credit, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t make it easy, and it\u2019s demoralising\u201d. On being out of work a decade ago, he added: \u201cThere were times me and my wife would share a piece of pizza in town because we couldn\u2019t afford lunch after I was unemployed in 2008; I thought that wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Amelia Hill, telesales operative, Rhondda In south Wales, 50-year-old single mother Amelia Hill has been provided with some \u201cbreathing space\u201d after it was confirmed on Monday that she would continue to be furloughed. But she fears there may be no job to go back to once the support ends as demand for photocopiers and printers \u2013 which she sells over the phone \u2013 has evaporated. \u201cThere are many people out of work and I worry about the future, as I have sole custody of my children and do not have any financial support from their father,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hopefully now I can see my way clear to Christmas; we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d Part-time since she has to care for her two school-age children, one of whom is autistic, Hill said the furlough payments from her minimum wage job were \u201c80% of not a lot\u201d but were at least something. \u201cIt delays a situation where I would\u2019ve been without money and waiting for universal credit,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what not a lot is and I can make do. But not knowing if anything is coming in is infinitely worse.\u201d With less income but more time on her hands, Hill has kept busy over the lockdown period; landscaping the garden, decorating the house and growing her own vegetables. However, she added: \u201cPeople will only put up with hunger and isolation for so long. All of this is disproportionately affecting ordinary people and in the longer term, I am worried about the more far-reaching effects upon society.\u201d Alex Shaw, hotel front of house manager, London Meanwhile, back in the capital, 28-year-old Alex Shaw \u2013 who has been furloughed since March \u2013 is unsure whether the extension of the scheme will have any impact on his redundancy consultation. \u201cI\u2019m yet to hear from my employer,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnically, from 1 November I was supposed to be getting 100% of my salary while going though the redundancy process but whether they will just keep us on furlough and either pause or cancel the redundancy, or still proceed, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He said that his hotel was undergoing its first round of redundancies since the pandemic struck, unlike many other hotels that are about to start a second round of cuts. \u201cOur company has been really, really good but there\u2019s no tourists and no-one is coming to London.\u201d he said. While he enjoyed the early stages of being furloughed amid the tropical weather, \u201cit\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s not fun any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been in limbo for the past seven months. The beginning was great, I was loving life, but we thought it would be over in a couple of months. We had no idea it would take this long.\u201d However, he was optimistic about the future, if he does lose his job. \u201cBeing made redundant, as horrible as it is, can be some form of release \u2013 with a cash injection. It might be time to re-evaluate stuff and look for something else. It is what it is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
