Speculation regarding the position of the Easter Road club's manager, John Collins, has been rife since reports of a row between disgruntled players and the former Scotland midfielder after last Saturday's defeat, ironically at the hands of Dunfermline. A meeting took place between members of the first-team squad and the Hibs chairman, Rod Petrie, on Monday evening amid claims of unrest. Collins has staunchly refused to discuss the subject in public but matters are expected to come to a head on Monday when Petrie chairs another round of talks, this time with both players and the manager in attendance. It remains highly unlikely Collins will be removed from office or resign but the future of players who have aired their grievances in such a public manner appears to be away from Hibs. \"We have one focus and one focus only, the biggest game of our season so far,\" said Chris Hogg, the defender who would have good reason to be in Collins' camp. Hogg was a bit-part player under the manager's predecessor, Tony Mowbray, but has become a regular since Collins arrived last November. Hogg added: \"The players are 100% focused on the next game, no matter what has gone on. I'm quite sick of hearing about Tony Mowbray now. We all know what he did for the club and what a good manager he is but everybody needs to forget about that. We have a new gaffer in charge and he's had a very positive influence both on the team and on individuals. It's time to move on from any comparisons, everything has been positive in my mind. John will do a great job at this club.\" Hibs have not lifted the Scottish Cup since 1902 but the rumblings of discontent appear all the more remarkable given that Collins presided over a CIS Cup final demolition of Kilmarnock only last month. Yet Hibs have generally flattered to deceive and the statistic of only three league wins in 2007 suggests an under-performing playing staff. In Collins' superstitious favour is the choice of referee tomorrow; Hibs have not lost any of their seven games officiated by Craig Thomson this season. Celtic's manager, Gordon Strachan, meanwhile, believes the lunchtime kick-off for his team's semi-final against St Johnstone today is far from ideal. Strachan's men, who can secure the Premierleague title next weekend, remain firmly on course for a domestic double but the manager feels preparations for the match against the First Division side will be more difficult than normal. \"We are dictated to by money,\" said Strachan, who will be without the injured Maciej Zurawski for today's tie. \"We're no different to anywhere else in that respect but I think we all enjoy a semi-final on a Saturday at three o'clock. I don't think any of us really enjoy playing at 12.30; there doesn't seem to be enough time for a build-up.\" The supporters, it would seem, agree with Strachan; neither semi-final is on course to attract more than 30,000 at the 55,000-capacity Hampden Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
