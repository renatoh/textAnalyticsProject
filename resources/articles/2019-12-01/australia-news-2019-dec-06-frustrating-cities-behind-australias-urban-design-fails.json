Bad urban design is a barrier to what should be the smooth flow of life in cities. It ruins commutes and can make daily life unnecessarily difficult for disabled and elderly people. Guardian Australia spoke to experts and chose a few of the worst examples across Australia \u2013 from the crossing chaos of Sydney\u2019s Central Station to the train stations in the middle of freeways in Perth. But we want to hear your examples too, both general and specific. Tell us your experiences in the comments below. Sydney: \u2018Urban design mistake 101\u2019 Crossing in almost any direction from Sydney\u2019s Central Station is an ordeal. But on the east side, the voyage across Elizabeth Street is such a crush of bodies that police are sometimes deployed to manage the crowd. \u201cThere are three crossing points that are missing,\u201d says Benjamin Driver, senior urban designer at Hill Thalis Architecture. \u201cIt squashes hundreds of people at one time between two columns. That to me is urban design mistake 101.\u201d Driver\u2019s solution is to add multiple single crossing points all around, or to make the entire thing a large, square scramble \u2013 like the one at the corner of Park and George streets in the CBD. The installation of the new light rail station \u2013 due to open on 14 December \u2013 has made the problem even worse. That one crossing is now a bottleneck for pedestrians, train traffic and a bike path that is frequently blocked by crowds of people waiting to cross the road. The crossing signal for the light rail tracks is so close to the road, its sound frequently gets confused for the road crossing. People can often be seen stepping out into the traffic on busy Elizabeth Street after hearing the light rail signal. \u201cThis is one of the most intense intersections in the city,\u201d Driver says. On the other side, the situation is hardly better. At Railway Square, where George Street becomes Broadway, the pedestrian crossing narrows to a very small triangle. From two wide and busy crossings, people are funnelled into a small area with barely enough standing room, as cars and buses whizz dangerously close by. \u201cIt comes historically from the way the trams used to meet and interchange,\u201d Driver says. \u201cIt used to be a big, beautiful flat square, people used to get off the tram and just walk across that square.\u201d But the popularity of cars has widened Broadway, and made the crossing increasingly hostile. Driver says that if infrastructure was better in other parts of the city \u2013 such as having more light rail through the inner west \u2013 that would reduce the number of buses and cars needing to travel down Broadway. \u201cYou could take back a lane on each side of the footpaths,\u201d he says. Melbourne: \u2018A bridge that is too low\u2019 The Montague Street bridge needs almost no introduction. Its story can be told in two perfect headlines. From May 2016: Safety upgrade to begin on Melbourne\u2019s accident-prone Montague Street bridge. And June 2016: Upgrade to Montague Street bridge fails to stop truck getting stuck \u2013 again. It is, quite simply, a bridge that is too low. Or, looked at another way, it is a street that frequently bears trucks that are too high. The three-metre-high bridge in South Melbourne has its own dedicated webpage: howmanydayssincemontaguestreetbridgehasbeenhit.com. It\u2019s at 29 at time of publication. Adelaide: \u2018Not enough footpath to walk on\u2019 The bugbear of Daniel Bennett, the South Australian president of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, is how car-centric Adelaide can be. \u201cWe have 300-odd laneways in the city, and in my former role at City of Adelaide we converted a lot of those,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ones that we haven\u2019t done are infuriating because there\u2019s no footpath, there\u2019s a little bit of bitumen and curb, there\u2019s not enough to walk on.\u201d Three in particular stand out: Coromandel Place, French Street and Chesser Street behind Grenfell Street where \u201cmost of the buses come in\u201d. Instead of being comfortable pedestrian spaces, Bennet says, residents are constantly in fear of getting hit by cars. A similar issue is West Terrace, on the west side of the city centre, and how it intrudes on to the CBD. \u201cAdelaide is brilliant because it has this parkland 770 hectares around the city,\u201d Bennet says. \u201cBut there is one bit of the main road that comes into the city, you\u2019ve actually excised a tenth of the parklands by one road \u2013 West Terrace. \u201cIt is impossible to cross, it takes you forever, it is really unfriendly to people trying to cross through it to parklands. If we made it smaller, maybe two or three lanes in each direction as opposed to seven or eight, and pushed all the traffic outside the parklands, you\u2019d solve it.\u201d Brisbane: \u2018Noisy and ugly infrastructure\u2019 \u201cAny Brisbane street in which the roadbed is wider than the bordering buildings are tall is an example of terrible urban design,\u201d says Dorina Pojani, a senior lecturer in urban planning at the University of Queensland. They create a sense of streets being \u201cbarren\u201d, she says, which makes them simply unpleasant to walk on. \u201cCloser to the centre, an example is, sadly, Stanley Street. I say sadly because this street is lined with charming old buildings, shops and cafes. It\u2019s a live reminder of the city\u2019s history. Yet the roadbed is overpowering. Too wide compared to the height of the buildings.\u201d Pojani says this could have been reduced by creating a two-way bike path along one side of Stanley Street, with a green strip. Other than that, there is the small matter of the Pacific Motorway interchange itself. \u201cTo the west, Stanley Street is bordered by that spaghetti bowl of the Pacific Motorway interchange. That type of noisy and ugly infrastructure has no place in a city centre, let alone right next to the city\u2019s most attractive parks (Southbank and the Botanical Garden) and two major hospitals (Mater Children\u2019s hospital and Queensland Children\u2019s hospital)\u201d. Perth: \u2018Vulnerability to sea level rise\u2019 Julian Bolleter, co-director of the Australian Urban Design Research Centre, says \u201cbad urban design\u201d is something that doesn\u2019t provide flexibility for the future. \u201cMost urban design decisions involves trade-off in certain things,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any really, really bad examples of design, I just think some of the trade-offs are not ideal. \u201cWhat constitutes good urban design is a structure that is resilient for potential futures. Bad urban design is a design that locks in vulnerabilities to future scenarios.\u201d He can think of two examples in Perth. \u201cIn Perth \u2026 we are currently designing apartment blocks around the river that are literally 1.2 metres above water level. They are are already needing to pump out those basements. That is locking in a vulnerability to sea level rise. \u201cWe have many train stations in Perth that are effectively designed by transport planners, not urban designers, which means you have generic rail stations in the middle of freeways that are not connected to urban activities.\u201d He points to stations along the Kwinana Freeway and the Mitchell Freeway. \u201cThey are essentially transit hubs where urban design is an afterthought. Train stations are often in the middle of freeways, because it\u2019s easy. In the end it doesn\u2019t really leverage great connection to the city.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
