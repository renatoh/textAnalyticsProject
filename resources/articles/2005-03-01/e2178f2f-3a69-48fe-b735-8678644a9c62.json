At the British Press Awards last week our writer Tim Moore was thrilled to win the Travel Writer of the Year title for three pieces he wrote for Escape in 2004. The prizes are the most prestigious in British journalism and were awarded on the basis of his articles on Egypt and Cyprus; easing the pain of turning 40 with a family holiday to Venice; and a third about Jersey. The judges said: 'Moore has a fantastic turn of phrase and strikes an excellent balance between aspirational and practical. Quintessential travel writing with exciting anecdotes.' He fought off competition from the Daily Mail, the Guardian and the Sunday Times. Receiving the award, Tim said: 'Having understood that prize-winning travel journalism demanded proficiency with machetes and crampons, I'm delighted to have secured this award without confronting any foreign terror that could not be tackled with factor 30 and Calpol. It's a defeat for hairy-chested derring-do at the hands of pigeon-chested derring-don't. Escape is increasingly unusual among travel supplements in allowing writers the freedom to compose their own stories, rather than welding them to some tedious agenda.' Couldn't agree more, Tim!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
