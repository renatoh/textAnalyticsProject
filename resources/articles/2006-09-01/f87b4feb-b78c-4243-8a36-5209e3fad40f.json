The first is Frank Lampard's fiancee, Elen Rives, dancing on a table in a Baden-Baden nightclub, clutching a champagne and amaretto cocktail and singing I Will Survive. The second is the serried ranks of identically outfitted US Ryder Cup wives, any one of whom traditionally makes a Stepford wife look like Anita Pallenberg, the girlfriend of various Rolling Stones, during her most wantonly abandoned phase. Post-World Cup, it is impossible to consider the business of male sportsmen being accompanied on tour by their female partners without thinking of those halcyon days in the Black Forest, when the England Wags thrilled the world on every outing with their triple-threat performance of shot downing, stiletto wearing, and extreme manicures, whilst their partners played as though recovering from all of the above. And yet, in truth, it was the world of golf that gave us the concept of the Wags. At the 1999 Ryder Cup in Brookline, Massachusetts, the wives of the US team posed for a picture which may be taken as the ur-Wag image, and which some feminists might argue was more distasteful than their husbands' infamous green invasion on the 17th. Clad in matching head-to-toe outfits, they resembled a cohort of androids (standard apple-pie pleasure series). Inevitably, Stepford comparisons were drawn, though it is a mark of the great strides golf has made in the gender wars that some commentators were progressive enough to describe the ladies as \"an extra club in the bag\". If football is, among other wellworn cliches, the working man's ballet, then it was perhaps no surprise that the football Wags disported themselves in Germany with appropriate exuberance. But taking golf as a steely mind game, it is equally unremarkable to find the golf Wags - or Gwags as they have been somewhat leadenly branded - to be rigorously disciplined. If golf's racy days ever existed (and you'd like to think there were Ryder Cups at which Nick Faldo would have got divorced and remarried during the course of the three-day tournament) they are not in evidence this week at the K Club in Co Kildare. Asked about her Wag status on Tuesday, US captain Tom Lehman's wife Melissa was the soul of graciousness. \"It's the first time I've come across that [term],\" she said. \"But I wouldn't have a problem with it. We are the wives after all, and in my opinion we are the strength behind the men.\" \"It could have been worse,\" chipped in her companion. \"Spouses and girlfriends would have been Sags.\" Mercifully, in this more rarefied atmosphere no one felt able to ask the traditional follow-up question - namely, have the players been \"slapped with a nookie ban\"? Although Melissa has pledged to lead an evening outing to Dublin's Temple Bar nightlife district this week, you would be able to secure enticing odds on the return journey to the hotel being marked by drunken mugging for the paparazzi, or raucous chants of \"There's only one Chris DiMarco!\" No, metaphorically speaking, the golf wags are not at the races. Though they have attended the actual races. Tuesday at the Curragh was Ryder Cup race day, where the organisers asked the European wives to judge the Best Turned Out Horse, apparently without a hint of irony. Last night's big event was a gala dinner where guests of honour included Bill Clinton, who you suspect may have felt more honoured had he been placed next to Elen Rives. Whether or not the individualistic US golfers can play as a team is a perennial question; that their wives can is a given. Indeed, the determined unity of both teams of Wags can make them appear veritable ciphers. There are secret CIA facilities about which we know more than the \"personal interests\" sections of these women's CVs. One can point out that Chad Campbell's wife, Amy, is an aspiring pop singer. But on the surface at least, the bewildering assumption amongst the Wags that this tournament happens to be about their husbands' jobs and not theirs has resulted in a total absence of the factionalism which gave a certain German spa town the flavour of Dangerous Liaisons with suntans. If you conclude the K Club womenfolk are mocking the Wag institution, then no incident has made this plainer than the reaction to a Dublin magazine's decision to print a glamour shot and wrongly identify the model as Tiger Woods's wife Elin. The Irish Daily Mail's headline? \"Mrs Tiger's fury over topless slur.\" Transpose the incident to the World Cup, and it could only have read \"Mrs Lampard's delight over topless slur.\" A tale of two Elins or Elens, then - and a poignant reminder that even Waggishness can't fight evolution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
