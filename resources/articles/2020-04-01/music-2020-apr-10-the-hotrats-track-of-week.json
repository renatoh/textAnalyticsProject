Do we really need a Kelis cover from Gaz and Danny from Supergrass? Is it actually a chunky, wonky, thigh-slappy hoot, or is it like slamming through a pack of Tunnock\u2019s before Bargain Hunt \u2013 ie, It\u2019s Just Something To Do? Difficult to say. I think it\u2019s magnificent. But then again, I haven\u2019t left my flat for three weeks and just ate a whole a jar of jalape\u00f1os. Chai No More Cake Cabin fever or not, this box-of-frogs whopper from artsy Japanese four-piece Chai absolutely bangs. \u201cLook at you, that\u2019s way too much / Your face is made up like a cake!\u201d they wail in prissy unison, over what sounds for all the world like Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Army of Me and Nine Inch Nails\u2019s Closer nipple-twisting each other to death at a sexy party.

Lovely to hear her dulcets, but for the Ri-Public this\u2019ll be like a nicotine patch, or screaming into a pillow because you want to go outside: it\u2019ll take the edge off, but not for long. Jess Williamson Infinite Scroll \u201cTime did unfold like an infinite scroll\u201d seems prescient at the moment, but rather than watching all three Lord of the Rings films while you languish in the Ocado queue, Austin tunester Williamson is deconstructing society\u2019s addiction to social media, making its languid desert-pop genuinely heartbreaking. Kings of Leon Going Nowhere Few phrases these days conjure as little excitement as \u201cthere\u2019s a new Kings of Leon song\u201d. And this is basically Oasis\u2019s Songbird, only with all that song\u2019s affable, doofus charm sucked out, so it sort of just plods hither and thither like a dying dog. Young people: KoL used to be good, honest. This, though, is toilet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
