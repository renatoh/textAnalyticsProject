I am the original CEO of the Renewable Energy Association. Since February I have been developing a business based on the FIT legislation. This involves a property group, investors, lawyers, planners, energy consultants, supply-chain specialists, landowners, surveyors and an engineering firm. All of these companies are British, many household names. The business is ready for launch, with all plans made with an assumption that this primary legislation cannot be changed before 2013. As CEO of this consortium, I have insisted to members that it would be unprecedented for a UK government to alter law having announced it to the business community and passed legislation. Were the coalition to abandon or negatively alter the basis upon which eight months of intensive research and development have been undertaken, then \u00a31m of entrepreneurial effort would have been wasted. With plans to develop 100MW of renewable energy in 30 months, further capital sums are committed. Should the government cut feed-in tariff rates, confidence would be severely damaged, steering investment abroad. Doubt would be cast on a reliable energy policy framework aimed at carbon reduction and renewable energy targets, leading to the loss of much-needed investment and of confidence among banks. In the event of any negative impact, the consortium I represent would consider legal action for recovery of costs, forgone future profits and punitive damages.
