Inevitably, it's a disappointment, though watched again now for this rerelease, it doesn't seem as much of a disappointment as all that. Milo O'Shea gives a very decent performance as Leopold Bloom: he is dignified, vulnerable, sensitive and tragicomic. However, Maurice Ro\u00ebves's Stephen Dedalus is flat and uninteresting; his opening dialogue scenes with Mulligan and Haines in the Martello Tower are odd and stilted, yet maybe there's no other way of doing them. I was reminded of Manoel De Oliveira's 2002 film I'm Going Home, in which John Malkovich plays a film-maker directing a new version of Ulysses, and unhappily attempting to direct Michel Piccoli's elderly French actor, whom he has stupendously miscast as Buck Mulligan. The resulting dialogue is bizarre and contorted, but actually not much more contorted than here. This film works best in its opening sequences, with Bloom racketing about Dublin, but when we move into the Circe \"Nighttown\" episode, the hallucinatory effects look like outtakes from Billy Liar. The final Penelope stream-of-consciousness monologue from Molly Bloom (Barbara Jefford) takes up almost a quarter of the running time, and Strick can think of no other approach than doing the whole thing in voiceover. It's an admission of defeat, but an understandable one. John Huston wound up doing the same thing in his 1987 version of The Dead. Perhaps the Strick Ulysses is most valuable in inviting us to see Ulysses not as a novel but an epically extended short story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
