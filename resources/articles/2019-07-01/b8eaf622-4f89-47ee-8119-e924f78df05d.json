Labor and Centre Alliance fear the government is set to ignore advice to improve scrutiny of proposed new powers for the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to exclude citizens from Australia and to phase out Asio\u2019s detention powers. By pushing ahead on two key bills without fully implementing recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, the government has set a test for Labor: to capitulate, despite having reached agreement on improvements with Coalition MPs, or stand up to Dutton at the risk of being accused of harming national security. When parliament returns on Monday, the lower house will debate new laws to punish trespass on agricultural land, the repeal of legislation facilitating medical evacuations from offshore detention, an extension of Asio\u2019s powers to detain and question people without charge and creation of a power for Dutton to block Australians from re-entering Australia on security grounds. Labor and Centre Alliance support the intent of the temporary exclusion order bill but believe the Coalition has failed to fully implement 11 of 18 recommendations of the PJCIS to include safeguards in the bill. The government has rejected a call from the committee \u2013 which is chaired by its own MP Andrew Hastie \u2013 that a judge, retired judge or a senior member of the administrative appeals tribunal should issue an exclusion order, not the minister. Instead, the government has proposed a right of review of the home affair\u2019s minister\u2019s decision to bar an Australian from returning for up to two years \u2013 but the decision can only be overturned if it is \u201clegally flawed\u201d. That would leave the discretion in Dutton\u2019s hands to decide if \u201creasonable grounds\u201d exist to conclude allowing an Australian to return to Australia would assist a terrorist organisation. In the Asio bill, the government has proposed extending the spy agency\u2019s power to detain people for up to seven days and question them for up to 24 hours. The powers are due to expire in September 2019 and the bill proposes a further 12-month extension. In May 2018 the PJCIS recommended that Asio keep its powers of compulsory questioning but lose powers of compulsory detention after two independent national security legislation monitors in 2012 and 2016 concluded they were \u201cnot necessary to prevent or disrupt a terrorist act\u201d. Senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia that Centre Alliance wants the government to tender advice that the exclusion order bill is constitutional and improve the oversight regime for issuing and reviewing exclusion orders. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a severe thing to prevent an Australian returning to Australia,\u201d he said. Patrick suggested there was a \u201cworkable solution\u201d if the government adopted the PJCIS recommendations. Labor\u2019s position is also to support the bill if the recommendations are adopted, but the issue will be further considered at shadow cabinet before parliament resumes. On the Asio bill, Patrick said the government has had \u201cplenty of time\u201d to implement recommendations to repeal or replace the detention powers. He said Centre Alliance would \u201csignal \u2026 discomfort\u201d but stopped short of committing to block the extension. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t support this sort of extension being moved again,\u201d Patrick said, suggesting Centre Alliance could support the initial 12-month extension but then draw the line at a further extension before September 2020, when he and Stirling Griff will still be in the parliament. The Law Council president, Arthur Moses, said Asio\u2019s questioning and detention powers are \u201csome of the most far-reaching and extraordinary powers granted to any intelligence organisation in the world\u201d, allowing it to \u201csecretly and immediately detain persons whether or not they are terrorist suspects\u201d. \u201cQuestioning and detention warrants are excessive, unnecessary, and have not been used once in their 13-year history,\u201d he said. \u201cThese powers should not be extended for another 12 months without clear justification.\u201d Introducing the Asio bill on 4 July, Dutton told the lower house it would ensure Asio \u201cretains its strong counterterrorism capabilities while the government progresses more detailed reforms to [its] questioning and detention powers\u201d. The explanatory memorandum for the exclusion order bill suggests it is necessary to ensure that if Australians return from overseas conflict zones authorities have forewarning and can set conditions on their return. \u201cThe bill does not permanently prohibit entry into Australia, and a person is entitled to be issued a return permit if they apply,\u201d it said. The government\u2019s decision to press on with both bills marks a further decline in bipartisanship on national security since February when Labor says it was forced to issue a minority report against the \u201clikely unconstitutional\u201d extension of Dutton\u2019s ability to strip terrorists of Australian citizenship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
