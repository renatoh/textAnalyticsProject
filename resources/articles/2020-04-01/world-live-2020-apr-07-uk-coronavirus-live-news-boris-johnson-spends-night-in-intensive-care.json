Raab said: [Johnson] is not just the prime minister. For all of us in cabinet, he is not just our boss. He is also a colleague and he is also our friend. So all our thoughts and prayers are with the prime minister at this time, with Carrie [Symonds] and his whole family. And I\u2019m confident he will pull through because if there is one thing that I know about this prime minister is he is a fighter and he will be back leading us through this crisis in short order. Raab expressed his support for Johnson as the PM received well-wishes from fellow leaders around the world, from members of the public, and even from the Queen and other members of the royal family. In an update on the PM\u2019s health, Raab confirmed that Johnson was not on a ventilator - but did not go beyond the relatively scant progress report issued by No 10 at lunchtime. (See 12.51pm.) Raab said: [Johnson] remained stable overnight. He\u2019s receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance, he\u2019s not required any mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and in keeping with usual clinical practice his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care. Raab played down the prospect of the lockdown restrictions being relaxed next week, when they are due to be reviewed for the first time. (See 5.53pm.) Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the number of coronavirus cases \u201ccould be moving in the right direction\u201d but that it would not be clear \u201cfor a week or so\u201d. Speaking at the press conference, Vallance presented a chart showing the latest data for new cases and said: It\u2019s possible that we\u2019re beginning to see the beginning of change in terms of the curve flattening a little bit. We won\u2019t know that for sure for a week or so There hasn\u2019t been the accelerated take-off and again it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re beginning to see the start of a change where we might see numbers flattening off. It does begin to suggest that things might be moving in the right direction in terms of numbers and it\u2019s important that we carry on with the measures that we have got in place in order to make sure that this does go in the right direction. Here is the chart that Vallance was referring to. It was one of five (pdf) he presented at the press conference. Raab implied that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, should be held accountable if the government failed to meet the target Hancock set for 100,000 coronavirus tests to be carried out a day by the end of this month. Asked who would \u201ccarry the can\u201d if the target were missed, Raab stressed that it was Hancock\u2019s target. He said the latest data showed 14,000 tests a day being carried out. Whitty implied that the UK could learn from Germany\u2019s success with testing. Asked why the number of deaths from coronavirus in Germany was rising at a slower rate than in the UK, Whitty said: We all know that Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus and there\u2019s a lot to learn from that and we\u2019ve been trying to learn the lessons from that. Keir Starmer has been praised by Jewish leaders for achieving \u201cin four days more than his predecessor in four years\u201d after he held a video conference to set out steps Labour would be taking to stamp out antisemitism. For more coronavirus coverage, do read our global coronavirus blog: There are now confirmed cases of Covid-19 in more than a third of prisons in England and Wales, according to a daily update from the Ministry of Justice. As of 5pm on Monday, 116 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 across 43 prisons, up from 107 prisoners across 38 prisons at the same time on Sunday. There are 83,000 prisoners in England and Wales in 117 prisons. The number of prison staff who have tested positive remained at 19 across 12 prisons in the period, while the number of infected prisoner escort and custody services (Pecs) staff remained at four. With the negotiations over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU in flux due to the coronavirus pandemic, David Frost, the British chief negotiator has said he will hold talks by video-conference call with his counterpart, Michel Barnier, next week. Frost tweeted: I want to reassure everyone that UK-EU contacts have been continuing in these difficult times. We have remained in touch throughout, both sides have exchanged legal texts, and last week we had a series of conference calls to explore and clarify technicalities. The UK side will share further legal texts with the European commission shortly. I and Michel Barnier will speak next week and we aim to reach agreement on a timetable for the discussions needed in April and May. Further details will follow then. There was only one round of face-to-face talks ahead of the lockdowns on either side of the Channel. The other scheduled rounds in Brussels and London were abandoned soon after. The EU has published a draft treaty on the future relationship. The UK has provided some legal text to the commission on its vision of the trade relationship but is yet to publish any papers. Dominic Raab did not have anything much to announce in that press conference, and it seemed as if the message he was most keen to deliver was his personal message of support for Boris Johnson. (See 5.05pm.) It is always advisable to show strong support for the boss, even if you don\u2019t particularly mean it, but in this case it seemed very obvious that Raab did. Johnson\u2019s illness has clearly shocked his colleagues, and their concern for him is genuine. Beyond that, what was probably most interesting was what Raab had to say about the prospect of the lockdown measures being relaxed. When Johnson announced the lockdown 15 days ago, he said: I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. The three-week deadline comes up on Monday. But when Raab was asked about the prospect of the restrictions being lifted in any way next week, he very much played down the idea. He said: In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet. We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice. Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message, which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance. There is a long Easter bank holiday weekend coming up, warm weather and we understand people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance. It is helping, it is contributing to our ability to tackle the coronavirus. The worst thing now would be to take our foot off the pedal, to ease up on that and risk losing the gains that have been made. And in another answer, Raab said: The critical thing is to take evidence-based decisions and so we\u2019ve said that we will take any review once we\u2019ve got the evidence that the measures are working and having the kind of impact taking us past the peak which means that they can be responsibly done. We\u2019re not at that stage yet. Prof Chris Whitty was a bit more explicit. Talking about when some of the restrictions might be relaxed, he said: It\u2019s really important that we get to the point that we\u2019re all confident that we\u2019re beyond the peak and then at that point start making it clear what combination of things, and over what period of time, seems a sensible combination to take us through. Q: A letter from GPs to Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, suggests some people who should be shielded are not being shielded. What will you do about that? Whitty says there are three categories for shielding: what everyone should do; what people who are over 70 and otherwise vulnerable should do; and what a group of 1.5 million people who are especially vulnerable because of health conditions need to do. He says the government will want to protect people in this third group for quite a long period of time. He says some people in the group of 1.5 million will have decided that they do not wish to be part of this. Some of these people might have a terminal illness and have made a rational decision not be to be shielded. Q: Are you promising that you will carry out 100,000 daily antigen tests by the end of the month? If you do not meet that, will someone carry the can? Raab says the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been very clear what the target is. Q: So are you promising that 100,000 antigen tests can be carried out by the end of the month? Raab says he will not go beyond what the health secretary has said. The government is going to strain every sinew to get these tests done, he says. This target still stands, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Whitty says care homes and nursing homes will present some of the biggest challenges. He says he expects the number of deaths in these places to go up. Vallance says the UK is publishing data for hospital deaths because that is how many other countries are presenting their data. Q: Will there be a three-week review of the lockdown? Or will it wait until the PM is out of hospital? And there was modelling published on Friday suggesting this lockdown could go on for months. Will you level with people and admit that? Raab says he thinks the government has levelled with people. It needs to look at the data, showing how these measures have worked, before deciding what do to next. Whitty says it is essential to get beyond the peak first. At that point they can decide what combination of measures might stay in place. He says there are disadvantages to keeping the lockdown in place too long. Q: Has the PM given you any indication of when the lockdown might be relaxed? Other countries have levelled with the public? Raab says we are not at that point yet. They remain focused on conveying the key message, which is that everyone should comply with the guidance. He says the guidance is helping. The worst thing would be to \u201ctake our foot off the pedal\u201d. It is critical that people keep up this discipline. Q: So this lockdown is going to have to stay for a few more weeks at least? Raab says he does not accept that. He says they have been guided by the data. Once they get reliable data on the impact these measures have had, they will be able to take decisions. Q: What could we have done differently? Vallance says this is a pandemic. It is applying everwhere. We are three or four weeks behind Italy. Keeping the numbers below ICU capacity is critical. It is essential to keep this suppressed, he says. Q: How could it be that three people in charge of telling the country not to catch this virus caught it? Because it is very indiscriminate, says Raab. Q: If you needed to change direction, do you have the authority to do that? Raab says he has been asked to deputise for the PM for as long as necessary. The normal cabinet collective responsibility will apply. Q: Would you have the confidence to change course if you could not get the PM\u2019s approval? Raab says he has total confidence in the arrangements put in place. Q: The increase in deaths in Germany is much slower than in other EU countries. What can we learn from them? Vallance says he does not have a clear answer to that. Two factors apply: the virus and the society it hits. He suggests Germany might be different. Whitty says Germany got ahead in terms of testing. There are lessons to be learned from that. They are now taking questions. Q: Who will take decisions if there is a disagreement in cabinet? Raab says they try to take decisions collectively. He says the PM has given them very clear plans. Q: Will there be enough intensive care beds? Vallance says there are always times in winter when the number of beds is under pressure. But he says the supply is moving in the right direction. Vallance says the capacity of intensive care beds is increasing. And he says the death figures should start to come down in the next two or three weeks. Vallance is speaking now. He presents various slides. The first shows transport use declining dramatically. He says that has led to the number of new cases growing at a much smaller rate than initially. What we are not seeing is an acceleration. He shows a graph showing the number of hospital admissions. There has been a steady increase, but not an \u201caccelerated take-off\u201d. He says it is possible there might be the beginnings of a change. It is too soon to be sure, but he says it might be the start of a shift. He also says there are 9,100 patients taking part in clinical trials. Raab delivers the latest figures for coronavirus testing. Raab says the PM\u2019s illness has been a shock to those in cabinet. He is not just their boss; he\u2019s a colleague and friend. Raab goes on: I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll pull through because if there\u2019s one thing I know about this prime minister, he\u2019s a fighter. Raab starts with an update on the PM. He says the PM remained stable overnight and is getting standard oxygen treatment. He does not require an invasive respiratory support. His condition is being monitored closely and further updates will be issued, he says. Raab\u2019s wording is almost exactly the same as the wording used by No 10 in the lobby briefing earlier. (See 12.51pm.) Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, who is deputising for Boris Johnson while Johnson is in hospital, is starting the government\u2019s daily press conference now. He is appearing with Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Police in North Yorkshire have increased patrols in Harrogate amid reports of reports of people having picnics, residents drinking in the streets, groups congregating in the town centre and people meeting to go for walks in the spa town. Harrogate\u2019s neighbourhood policing inspector, Penny Taylor, of North Yorkshire police, said: It is really disappointing that we are having to step up our patrols in Harrogate today. Whilst we know the majority of people in the town are doing the right thing and staying at home, despite the beautiful weather, it is unacceptable that some people are showing such a blatant disregard for the government\u2019s guidance. The charity, Women in Prison, says the government is taking too long to release pregnant inmates from jails after it emerged fewer than one in five had been released a week after the emergency measure was announced. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told a private session of the justice committee that six pregnant inmates had been released to date. (See 3.37pm.) Kate Paradine, chief executive of Women in Prison, said: Failure to act with urgency to drastically reduce the number of people in prison will have a devastating impact on all of our communities. The government is taking too long to release pregnant women and those on mother and baby units from prison. Now is not the time for complacency, the government must act fast to release the remaining pregnant women and many more people from prison with the housing and support they need. A woman from West Yorkshire has been sentenced to eight months in jail after spitting at a police officer. Lianne Mottershead, 30, from Huddersfield, assaulted a police officer by kicking him in the groin in the early hours of 6 April whilst heavily intoxicated. She was taken to Trafalgar House police station, Bradford, where she spat at another police officer. The spittle landed in his mouth and on his cheek, according to the prosecution. She then informed the custody sergeant that she was infected with coronavirus, going on to tell another officer that she hoped they would \u201cdie of corona\u201d, Leeds magistrates court heard on Tuesday. When interviewed she said that the NHS had advised her to self-isolate on the basis of the symptoms she described. The chief crown prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, Gerry Wareham, said: This behaviour is as disgusting as it is dangerous. In the current climate, it is beyond belief that someone should deliberately spit at another person, let alone a police officer performing their duties in the current challenging circumstances. Mottershead has been sentenced to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. I hope she spends that time reflecting on the absolute stupidity of her actions. She was sentenced to two months for the initial assault by beating of an emergency worker, and a further six months for the second assault, involving spitting. The sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. The Department for Health and Social Care has issued its latest update on hospital coronavirus deaths in the UK. It gives the latest daily for the number of deaths is 786, taking the total number of UK hospital deaths to 6,159. Vicars have been urged to stop live streaming services from their empty churches over the Easter weekend, with the country remaining in lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak, PA Media reports. The London College of Bishops said it was making the \u201cpainful\u201d request to the clergy ahead of the Easter weekend, one of the most significant times in the Christian calendar. In a statement, the bishops said: It feels extremely hard to ask this of you, this week of all weeks. But you will know that some people believe that being in our churches to stream, even if it is accessed by a door in your home, is encouraging others to want to travel to their church, and for others to ask for churches to be open to the public. We would not want to be seen to encourage any laxity in the requirement to stay indoors except for designated reasons, because this will save lives, and protect the NHS. A Labour district councillor and town council mayor has apologised for saying that Boris Johnson \u201ccompletely deserves this\u201d after he was taken to hospital with Covid-19. As the Press Association reports, Sheila Oakes, who is mayor of Heanor in Derbyshire and an Amber Valley district councillor, posted the comment on Facebook on Monday night. Replying to a message calling for people to say a prayer for the prime minister, she wrote: \u201cSorry, he completely deserves this and he is one of the worst PMs we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Chris Emmas-Williams, the Labour leader of Amber Valley council, said that Oakes has now apologised and that she has been suspended from the Labour group pending an investigation. Oakes told BBC Radio Derby: \u201cI made a mistake\u201d. Twelve NHS trusts in England have already recorded at least 100 coronavirus deaths, PA Media reports. They are: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust: 263 London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust: 183 King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: 163 Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust: 151 Barts Health NHS Trust: 138 St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: 120 Croydon Health Services NHS Trust: 118 The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust: 114 Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust: 112 Sandwell &amp; West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust: 106 Epsom &amp; St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust: 102 Lewisham &amp; Greenwich NHS Trust: 100 The UK government has issued guidance to councils in England saying that they need to prioritise \u201cblack bag\u201d bin collections as services come under pressure because of coronavirus. It says: It is important that local authorities maintain collections of residual waste and food waste and prevent waste from building up so as to protect local amenity and public health. It also says councils should consider reallocating \u201cappropriate\u201d staff from elsewhere within the local authority or waste collection company to maintain minimum statutory services, which includes picking up residual rubbish. Only six out of a potential 35 pregnant inmates have been released from prison since the government announced the emergency measure a week ago, the justice secretary has told MPs. The Ministry of Justice announced on 31 March it would temporarily release pregnant women in custody who do not pose a high risk of harm \u201cwithin days\u201d to protect them and their unborn children from coronavirus. There were 35 pregnant women in prison as of 6pm on 30 March. Robert Buckland told a private session of the justice committee that six pregnant women have been released so far. David Cameron, the former prime minister, has been giving interviews about Boris Johnson\u2019s illness. Cameron told ITV that he did not think people should worry about no one running the country because, if Johnson could not take a decision, the No 10 team and Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, would be able to take over. \u201cThe right decisions, I\u2019m sure, will be taken,\u201d Cameron said. A single dose of antibodies drawn from the blood of Covid-19 survivors appears to have improved the symptoms of 10 patients severely ill with the disease, according to new research. As PA Media reports, the treatment, known as convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, involves using antibody-rich blood plasma of those who have recovered from coronavirus, which can neutralise the bug to fight infection. Scientists in China who conducted the preliminary study said no serious adverse reactions were observed after CP transfusion. They believe the findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that CP therapy might be a safe and promising treatment for severe Covid-19 patients, and add further investigation is needed in controlled clinical trials. But Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the president of the British Pharmacological Society, expressed caution about the findings. He said: This was not a randomised trial and all patients also received other treatments including antivirals such as remdesivir, which are currently in trials for Covid-19. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has told MPs he is not currently considering the release of inmates in open prisons. The justice committee is currently questioning the secretary of state in private due to technical and staffing restrictions but is publishing live updates on the evidence via Twitter. Buckland has told the Committee he is not currently considering the release of category D prisoners - that is prisoners held in open prisons. This will raise eyebrows among those advocating further release of prisoners, considering open prisons have minimal security and allow eligible prisoners to spend most of their day away from the prison on licence to carry out work, education or for other resettlement purposes. Open prisons only house prisoners that have been risk-assessed and deemed suitable for open conditions. On Saturday Buckland announced that up to 4,000 risk-assessed prisoners who are within two months of their release date will be temporarily released from jail. And the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have also sent their wishes for a speedy recovery to the prime minister this morning. This is from the Queen\u2019s Twitter feed. And this is from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. (The W at the end means that it is a personal message from Prince William, not just a message typed by a flunkey.) And there have been three new coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland, according to the latest update (pdf) from Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Health Agency. These three deaths, combined with the 758 from England (see 2.18pm), the 74 from Scotland (see 1.50pm) and the 19 from Wales (see 2.08pm), would take the UK total of new deaths to 854. We will get an official UK figure from the Department of Health and Social Care later. As Nadine White at HuffPost points out, there is normally a slight difference between the official UK total and the figure produced by the combination of the separate figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is because some of the reporting criteria differ. Yesterday the official DHSC figure for new UK deaths was 439. Air traffic in the UK is down 92% on the same day in 2019, while rail travel is down 95%, according to the latest government figures. The transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris - updating the Commons transport select committee on the effects of the coronavirus, in a meeting held remotely \u2013 said road volumes were also down 71% for last year overall, and by 83% on the strategic road network, or major roads. Bus passenger numbers are now down 88%, with services down 54% compared with 2019. In London, tube journeys are down by 94%, while bus journeys are 80% down on last year. Cross-Channel Eurostar journeys are now just 1% of last year\u2019s numbers. And NHS England has just released its latest figures for coronavirus deaths in hospitals in England. In a statement it said: A further 758 people, who tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 5,655. Patients were aged between 23 and 102 years old. 29 of the 758 patients (aged between 23 and 99 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Yesterday the figure for new coronavirus deaths in hospitals in England was 403, but the large difference between that figure and today\u2019s may be partly explained by the delay in the reporting of some deaths that occurred over the weekend. There have been 19 further coronavirus deaths in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. In a statement its coronavirus incident director Dr Giri Shankar said: 291 new cases have tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 3,790, although the true number of cases is likely to be higher. 19 further deaths have been reported to us of people who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19), taking the number of deaths in Wales to 212. The chocolate and confectionery giant Mars has donated 1m Easter eggs to NHS workers, food banks and community groups. The Easter treats, which include products under the Maltesers, M&amp;Ms, Galaxy and Mars brands, have been handed out directly to hospitals including the new Nightingale hospital in London and the Countess of Chester hospital in the north-west. They will also be available via food banks and other community projects supplied by the national FareShare food distribution charity. The artist Jeremy Deller has created a poster celebrating the role of immigrants in combating the coronavirus to raise funds for refugees, asylum seekers and food banks during the pandemic. Money raised from sales of the poster, which states Thank God For Immigrants, will support Refugee Action and the Trussell Trust, which runs two-thirds of the UK\u2019s food banks. Its muted multi-coloured pastel hues also evoke church posters and Easter, although Deller said the words refer to any god. The A2-sized posters, which cost \u00a325, are available from the website of graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, who collaborated with Deller on the project. Deller said the poster was a comment on how public attitudes towards immigrants in the UK have shifted since the Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s what people must be thinking to themselves, even if they weren\u2019t three months ago. Even Piers Morgan said it today. [The poster] is a reflection of how our value systems are changing. How our view of the world is changing.\u201d Muggeridge said he hoped people would display the posters as a tribute to NHS staff and other key workers from black and minority ethnic backgrounds who are on the frontline of dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak. He said: A lot of immigrants are working in our hospitals and we hope people will put the posters in their windows to thank and support them for everything they\u2019re doing. The first four doctors who died of Covid-19 in the UK \u2013 Dr Alfa Saadu, 68, Amged el-Hawrani, 55, and Adil El Tayar, 64 and GP Dr Habib Zaidi, 76\u2013 were from a BAME background. Another, senior heart surgeon Jitendra Rathod, died aged 62 at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff on Monday. Nurse Areema Nasreen, 36, died in late March at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, began her daily briefing today by sending her best wishes to the prime minister, telling him: \u201cWe are all willing you on, Boris.\u201d She announced an increase of 268 positive cases in Scotland, taking the total to 4,229, and a further 74 deaths registered in the last 24 hours, taking the total deaths to 296. She cautioned that this increase reflected fewer registrations over the weekend. Asked how long she would continue to work should she become ill with the virus herself, she said that she would seek guidance and \u201cwork as long as medically appropriate\u201d, adding that continuity plans were in place in terms of the deputy first minister taking over. Reporters raised concerns of care workers about the availability of PPE (personal protective equipment). Sturgeon said that she didn\u2019t want anyone to feel they needed to whistleblow to the media at this time but that she wanted everyone with concerns about PPE or anything else to feel able to raise them directly with her government. She said that while there were known difficulties in the global supply chain, the safety of frontline workers would always drive decisions on provision of kit. Announcing a \u00a35.3m funding boost for community pharmacists, Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, said that she was acutely aware of the impact of lockdown on mental health, especially amongst younger people, and that work was under way with youth organisations. Finally, responding to a question about the resignation of chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood over the weekend following the flagrant breach of her own lockdown guidance, Sturgeon urged people to acknowledge that \u201cwe are all trying to do our best\u201d, adding: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s most important to show people kindness is when they have made a mistake.\u201d Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest Science Weekly podcast. Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Jenna Macciochi about how our immune systems fight off infections such as coronavirus, and \u2013 as per lots of your questions \u2013 what happens if we\u2019re immunocompromised The Wellcome Trust is calling on big businesses to donate $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) for research into developing diagnostic tests, therapies and vaccines to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Rupert Neate reports. His full story is here. Police were called to a funeral in the West Midlands after around 60 mourners flouted coronavirus lockdown measures. The group failed to disperse at Streetly crematorium after being encouraged to do so by officers, but no further action was taken. Walsall council have now said that the gates at the site will remain locked, with only controlled access given to mourners. In line with government guidance, the authority are allowing only 10 people to attend funerals. Ch Supt Andy Parsons of West Midlands police said that the force would only enforce laws as \u201can absolute last resort\u201d, but stressed that restrictions were in place to prevent more deaths during the pandemic. He said: Unfortunately we were unable to encourage the mourners to adhere to current restrictions and the funeral continued in breach of the new government guidelines issued last week. We understand that this is deeply distressing time for bereaved families and friends but there are restrictions on the number of people permitted to attend funerals to protect everyone from the spread of Covid-19. There could be as many as 66,000 Covid-19 deaths in the UK during the first wave of the current pandemic, more than a third of the expected death toll across Europe, according to modelling by a US university. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine estimated that approximately 151,680 people were likely to die from the virus across the continent. According to a news release by the institute: The death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared with 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 744 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available). There is more here, on the global coronavirus live blog. Here is a full summary of the Downing Street lobby briefing. Boris Johnson does not have pneumonia, Downing Street has said. Until now ministers and No 10 have refused to give a clear answer to this question. But asked if the PM has been diagnosed with pneumonia, the PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThat is not the case, no.\u201d The spokesman said that Johnson was \u201cstable\u201d overnight and \u201cremains in good spirits\u201d. (See 12.51pm.) Downing Street has signalled that it does not want to take up Donald Trump\u2019s offer of experimental coronavirus drugs for Boris Johnson. (See 12.51pm.) Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would take over if Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary who is deputising for the PM, got ill, the spokesman said. The spokesman said there was an established order of precedence in the government. After Raab, Sunak, is the next most senior person in the government, the spokesman said. (The spokesman sidestepped a question about who was next in seniority, and \u201chow long it would take before Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey took charge\u201d, but the order of precedence is normally the order in which ministers are listed on the official No 10 website. In theory, after Sunak, Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, are next in seniority - in that order. Coffey is 11th on the list.) Raab does not have the authority to \u201chire and fire\u201d people in government while he is deputising for the PM, the spokesman said. The spokesman played down the prospect of the government announcing plans for an exit strategy from the lockdown anytime soon. He said that no was not the time to focus on this. The spokesman refused to say when the government would announce whether or not the lockdown measures are being extended. When they were announced by the PM, they were scheduled to run for a three-week period which will be over next Monday. The spokesman said that announcement about whether they would be extended would not necessarily come that day. He did not rule out it happening this week. He claimed there was no legal need for the lockdown to be renewed. [This is true in the short term, but the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which give legal force to the lockdown measures in England, do have to be reviewed every 21 days, with the first review due by 16 April. And the regulations expire after six months.] The spokesman refused to speculate on suggestions that schools could be opened before other lockdown measures are reversed (a proposal backed by University College London research published today). The spokesman rejected claims that the PM was getting special treatment at the St Thomas\u2019 Hospital. When asked about claims that a ventilator was being set aside for the PM, the spokesman said there was \u201csignificant spare capacity\u201d available in hospitals, including ventilators. The spokesman rejected claims that No 10 has not been fully frank with the media about the PM\u2019s health. \u201cWe have a commitment to be as transparent as we can be throughout this process,\u201d the spokesman said. We have been fully frank with you throughout. We have issued you with regular updates on the prime minister\u2019s health. His condition worsened yesterday afternoon. A decision was taken that he needed to be moved to an intensive care unit at around 7pm. We informed you all as soon as was practically possible. We have a commitment to be as transparent as we can be throughout this process. The spokesman said Raab would be able to authorise military action in the PM\u2019s absence. The spokesman said that, if a national security council was needed, Raab would chair it in the PM\u2019s absence. There was a robust national security architecture in place, the spokesman said. And he said it had the authority and ability to respond to a military threat in the PM\u2019s absence. The spokesman said Johnson had not spoken to Raab today. Raab will not participate on the PM\u2019s behalf in the weekly audience with the Queen, the spokesman said. The spokesman said that it has been agreed with Buckingham Palace that these weekly audiences will be suspended while the PM is ill. The spokesman said Raab was feeling fine. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, is working as usual, the spokesman said. But he said Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, was still staying away from the office. Asked about the shortage of staff in No 10, the spokesman said it was \u201cfully operational\u201d. Dominic Raab will lead the press conference later at 5pm. He will be joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Prof Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. It took place by conference call, as is normal now. Here are the top lines. Boris Johnson does not have pneumonia, Downing Street has said. Until now ministers and No 10 have refused to give a clear answer to this question. But asked if the PM has been diagnosed with pneumonia, the spokesman said: \u201cThat is not the case, no.\u201d The spokesman said that Johnson was \u201cstable\u201d overnight and \u201cremains in good spirits\u201d. In a statement about his condition in intensive care, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The prime minister has been stable overnight and remains in good spirits. He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance. He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. Downing Street has signalled that it does not want to take up Donald Trump\u2019s offer of experimental coronavirus drugs for Boris Johnson. Asked about this, the spokesman said: We are confident that the prime minister is receiving the best possible care from the health service. Any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would take over if Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary who is deputising for the PM, got ill, the spokesman said. Raab does not have the authority to \u201chire and fire\u201d people in government while he was deputising for the PM, the spokesman said. I will post a full summary of the briefing shortly. From Derbyshire Police Another major domestic abuse charity has reported a surge in activity during the Covid-19 lockdown. Women\u2019s Aid is reporting a 41% increase in users visiting their Live Chat between 26 March and 1 April, compared with the previous week, as well as a marked increase in visitors across all digital support services. The Women\u2019s Aid Covid-19/Coronavirus advice page for domestic abuse survivors has had 27,000 page views since its launch. The figures come after the charity Refuge reported a 25% increase to the national domestic abuse helpline, which provides advice and facilitates referrals to refuge accommodation. Women\u2019s Aid and others have raised concerns that during this period, domestic abusers and their partners are self-isolating together at home and close proximity for extended periods may cause an increase in abusive incidents. Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket, has this morning become the latest to lift purchasing restrictions in its stores \u2013 on all but a few product areas including toilet rolls, eggs and home baking. A Tesco spokesperson said: In recent days, as panic buying has eased, we\u2019ve been able to increase stock to normal levels for most products. We\u2019ve removed the purchase limit of three items per customer, apart from on a few specific product areas where we will keep it in place for a little longer and it will be indicated on the shelf. The three items per customer limit will remain in place on; toilet rolls and paper goods such as tissues; household and personal cleaning products including hand sanitisers; packets and tins of food, including pasta and rice; fresh eggs; home baking including flour. The government is to make extra funding available for schools in England to cover additional costs during the coronavirus outbreak, including free school meals over the Easter holidays. After an outcry by council leaders, teachers and campaigners, ministers confirmed that free school meals - through vouchers or other local schemes - should continue to be available during the two-week holiday for all eligible children. Ordinarily schools would be closed over Easter, but many are staying open to look after vulnerable children and those of key workers in the fight against Covid-19. The government is offering \u00a325,000-75,000 per school as additional funding to cover the cost of keeping schools open and additional cleaning costs during the crisis in cases of suspected coronavirus. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: Schools across the country are going above and beyond to support children during this hugely challenging period. We must support them every step of the way, which is why we are making extra funding available, on top of existing budgets, to any school facing unavoidable costs incurred due to the coronavirus crisis. The government has also published a list of recommended online education resources to help children learn at home, which can be found here. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has added his name to the list of world leaders (see 7.43am) sending good wishes to Boris Johnson, the Telegraph\u2019s Roland Oliphant reports. Doctors\u2019 lives are still being put at risk by a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), with some calling the current provision \u201cuseless\u201d, the British Medical Association (BMA) has warned. As PA Media reports, more than two-thirds of doctors (69%) questioned by the BMA said they did not feel protected from Covid-19 infection, while some feel forced to work in high-risk areas without the right equipment. The snapshot survey of almost 2,000 medics showed that large numbers of doctors are still expected to care for Covid-19 patients with little or no PPE, the BMA said. Just 12% of 1,124 hospital doctors questioned said they felt fully protected from the virus at work, while 27% reported their trust was running low on basic supplies such as soap, PA Media reports. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA\u2019s council, said: In less than three days, nearly 2,000 doctors across the UK have told us how desperate their situation really is. Despite assurances from the government that personal protective equipment is making its way to the front line, this snapshot survey reveals a very different picture - healthcare workers in the UK simply do not have enough protective equipment to keep them safe. We are weeks into the most serious health crisis this country has faced in modern times and doctors are telling us they don\u2019t have any, or don\u2019t have enough, protective equipment. Until now, we have been hearing anecdotal stories about shortages or a lack of PPE. This survey confirms the extent of this failure. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has tweeted about his decision to self-isolate. (See 11.04am.) Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Turning away from Boris Johnson and coronavirus for a moment, Labour has just released a statement about a video meeting that its new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his deputy, Angela Rayner, had earlier with representatives of the UK Jewish community from the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council, the Community Security Trust and the Jewish Labour Movement. After it was over Starmer said that he had used the meeting to stress his commitment to setting up an independent complaints process for the party, cooperating fully with the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s inquiry into Labour and getting reports on all outstanding cases sent to him personally on a weekly basis. He added: Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on antisemitism. Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to \u2018pass the test\u2019 on antisemitism. We need to set new standards for best practice. In a joint statement after the meeting Board of Deputies president Marie van der Zyl, JLC chair Jonathan Goldstein, CST chair Gerald Ronson and JLM chair Mike Katz,said: While we would have fully understood the need to focus entirely on coronavirus at this time, Keir Starmer has already achieved in four days more than his predecessor in four years in addressing antisemitism within the Labour party. After that round of broadcast interviews, Michael Gove is now reported to be self-isolating because a member of his family has displayed symptoms of coronavirus. Gove is not currently displaying any symptoms of coronavirus and he has not been tested. Backdated weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown an increase in the percentage of deaths in England and Wales caused by Covid-19, writes Alexandra Topping and the Guardian\u2019s data team. In the week ending 27 March, 4.8% of all deaths in England and Wales were related to Covid-19, up from 1% the previous week, according to new figures from the Office of National Statistics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, which are based on death certificates, show there were 539 deaths where Covid-19 was listed in the week to 27 March, compared with 103 (1.0% of all deaths) up to 20 March. The figure includes deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes, and includes patients who have not tested positive for the virus but are suspected of having the disease. The number of new deaths connected to Covid-19 registered in England and Wales is slightly lower than that reported by the Department of Health and Social Care due to delays in reporting and registering news deaths. The ONS figures are based on mentions of Covid-19 in death certificates, while the government\u2019s daily statistics are taken from NHS Trusts. According to the ONS figures, up to 27 March 92.9% (501 deaths) involving Covid-19 occurred in hospital with the remainder happening in hospices, care homes and private homes. We also know the disease is more dangerous for older people. Today\u2019s ONS data provides a demographic breakdown for 647 deaths which were registered before 27 March. This shows that more than two thirds (69%) occurred among those aged 75 and over. The former lawyer and vocal Brexit supporter was born in 1974, and is the son of a Czech refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He studied at both Oxford and Cambridge, and when working for the Foreign Office his job was to lead a team attempting to bring suspected war criminals to justice at The Hague. A vocal supporter of Britain\u2019s move to leave the European Union, Raab was briefly the Brexit secretary under Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, but resigned after saying he could not agree to the withdrawal deal that had been struck between her government and the EU. The 46-year-old returned to government in July 2019, when Boris Johnson became prime minister. Even outside a health crisis, Raab holds the title of first secretary of state, as well as foreign secretary \u2013 and is in effect the prime minister\u2019s deputy. The new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has spoken to Dominic Raab, offering to work \u201cconstructively\u201d with ministers to get through the crisis. Speaking to the BBC, Starmer said: People are clearly anxious. I know the business of government will continue. I was in touch with the foreign secretary last night, and I want to say that the Labour party will act in the national interest. That\u2019s why I have offered to act constructively with the government and support them where that\u2019s the right thing to do, and push them further where we need to do it. Nine prisoners have died after contracting coronavirus, according to figures seen by the BBC\u2019s home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw. Last week an 84-year-old sex offender become the first British prisoner to die after contracting coronavirus. The deceased was an inmate at HMP Littlehey, a category C prison in Cambridgeshire that only holds male sex offenders. The Queen has issued a message to healthcare workers to mark World Health Day. She said in a statement: On the occasion of World Health Day, I want to thank all those in the healthcare profession for your selfless commitment and diligence as you undertake vitally important roles to protect and improve the health and well-being of people across the Commonwealth, and across the world. In testing times, we often observe that the best of the human spirit comes to the fore; the dedication to service of countless nurses, midwives and other health workers, in these most challenging of circumstances, is an example to us all. My family and I send our enduring appreciation and good wishes. If you\u2019ve tested positive for coronavirus and recovered, we\u2019d like to hear about your experience.

The doctors union, Doctors in Unite, has condemned guidance issued last week that suggested some coronavirus patients could be taken off ventilators in favour of those more likely to survive. A document issued by the British Medical Association, set out guidelines to ration care if the NHS becomes overwhelmed with new cases as the outbreak moves towards its peak. Under the proposals, designed to provide doctors with ethical guidance on how to decide who should get life-saving care when resources are overstretched, hospitals would have to impose severe limits on who is put on a ventilator. Large numbers of patients could be denied care, with those facing a poor prognosis losing the potentially life-saving equipment even if their condition is improving. A strong-worded statement issued by Dr Jackie Applebee, chair of Doctor in Unite, challenged such guidance. It said: We believe that all people are of equal value. Intensive care will not work for some patients. Ventilator support will sometimes not succeed. Doctors must judge who is most likely to improve with these measures, and who is not. These decisions have previously always been made on a case-by-case basis, where the risks and benefits to an individual patient are carefully considered. The arbitrary condemnation of one group or another is inexcusable. Being old, living in a care home, or having a pre-existing disability should not lead to an automatic exclusion from possible treatment. Blanket categorisation of large groups of people in such a way is prejudice. There is no place for it in the NHS. There may come a time where our healthcare system is overwhelmed. But we have not yet reached that point. The statement also said it was \u201cimmoral\u201d to request health and social care workers to look after patients without appropriate personal protective equipment. WhatsApp is to impose a strict new limit on message forwarding as the Facebook-owned chat app seeks to slow the dissemination of fake news, the company has announced. If a user receives a frequently forwarded message \u2013 one which has been forwarded more than five times \u2013 under the new curbs, they will only be able to send it on to a single chat at a time. That is one fifth the previous limit of five chats, imposed in 2019. An experienced and hugely admired heart surgeon has died in an intensive care unit in Wales after testing positive for Covid-19. Jitendra Rathod, 58, and a father of two, died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff on Monday. Rathod was an associate specialist in cardio-thoracic surgery at the hospital in the Welsh capital. He is thought to be the first health worker in Wales to die following a Covid-19 diagnosis. Will Walden, a friend of Boris Johnson and his former director of communications during his time as London mayor, says the prime minister is conscious but the worsening of his condition yesterday shocked Number 10. Speaking to BBC News after a briefing from Johnson\u2019s aides this morning, Walden said: Like the rest of the country they\u2019re a bit discombobulated. There\u2019s a sense of shock and [they\u2019re] a little bit stunned at the sort of turn of events in the middle of a national crisis. But I do think they\u2019re being as transparent as possible with his condition. He is apparently awake and conscious, he\u2019s not on a ventilator. Walden said Johnson was physically strong but a difficult patient. He said: He was my boss, but he\u2019s also a friend \u2013 he\u2019s incredibly strong and resilient, both mentally and physically. He\u2019s a pretty fit guy, Boris. He may not look that fit. He\u2019s got a heavy frame. He played a lot of rugby at school. He\u2019s a fairly big guy, but he plays tennis very well. He runs regularly. If anyone\u2019s got a chance of beating this, then Boris Johnson\u2019s got a chance of doing that. My understanding is that he did have his workload cut back significantly in the last week, he was in constant contact with the doctors. I would imagine that he took the decision to go to hospital pretty reluctantly. He\u2019s not a good patient, He often battles through colds and flu ... And he\u2019s pretty stoic and can be a bit bloody minded about this sort of thing. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been that in this case, the doctors are in constant contact with him. They\u2019ve advised him that he was right to go to hospital ... I fully expect that the prime minister will make a full recovery and in the interim, difficult decisions, if they have to be made will be made by Dominic [Raab] with the support of the cabinet. General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, insisted there was a clear chain of command for the armed forces while the prime minister remains in intensive care. He told Today: It\u2019s very clear I think. We work straight through to the prime minister but of course there\u2019s the National Security Council (NSC) that\u2019s wrapped around him and formed of many of the cabinet ministers and supported by the national security adviser. I think on that basis we\u2019re pretty confident it\u2019s business as usual as far as the operations are concerned. Sir Nick said he believed Raab would chair the NSC and be supported by others. Lord Heseltine, who served as deputy prime minister under John Major, has joined calls for great clarity about Raab\u2019s role. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Heseltine said there \u201cisn\u2019t a clarity\u201d about what Raab can do as deputy, noting: I was deputy prime minister but I was never prime minister, if you know what I mean. In other words, John Major was always in good health and in touch so the questions never really arose. There must come a time when a deputy is effectively prime minister, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve probably quite got to that now but the present urgency of the situation and the potential decisions that may need to be taken quickly does mean that Dominic Raab will have to use his discretion and know when to act. This is a very difficult thing to do because he will be surrounded by lots of people who know what Boris Johnson said, believe Boris will be quickly back and have their own personal agendas anyway, so it\u2019s a very difficult personal position and the man will be tested by the loneliness of the job. Boris Johnson remains in intensive care but without the need for a ventilator as Dominic Raab prepares for his first day in charge of the country, Michael Gove has said. In a move to reassure the public, Gove said the government was functioning well without the prime minister, who was admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital on Sunday night. The Cabinet Office minister said Johnson has \u201cfollowed medical advice\u201d at all times, after concerns that the prime minister had still been working and in charge from his hospital bed until 7pm on Monday. In a round of broadcast interviews, Gove said Johnson was fit, enjoyed tennis and has a \u201czest and appetite for life\u201d, so it was \u201cnaturally concerning\u201d how ill he was with coronavirus. St Thomas\u2019 hospital sources have told the Times that Johnson was not put on a ventilator but did require 4 litres of oxygen. The following account tallies with what Gove told the Today programme: Mr Johnson, 55, had not been intubated \u2014 where a tube is inserted into the windpipe before ventilation \u2014 but needed four litres of oxygen in intensive care, sources at the hospital said. The normal threshold for intensive care is 15 litres, suggesting that he was in better health than such patients generally. The Guardian has been told that a hospital bed was being prepared for Johnson as early as last Thursday: The first indication that Boris Johnson was sicker with coronavirus than either he or his aides were letting on came on Thursday morning. The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas\u2019 hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the defence committee, has called for greater clarity from the government about who now has responsibility for national security decisions. Gove stressed that any decision to ease the current lockdown arrangements would be made by the cabinet not unilaterally by Raab. He said: These decisions will be taken collectively and they will be taken following appropriate advice. The original decision to impose the social distancing rules followed the advice that we had from the government\u2019s scientific advisory body. And we are monitoring the data, we\u2019re reviewing everyday the degree of compliance and adherence to these rules. And we\u2019re doing so because nobody wants us to live as a society in lockdown. We\u2019re very, very conscious that people, particularly families with children, find lockdown challenging. But we do have to follow the lockdown advice at the moment. As the prime minister\u2019s case, reminds us this disease can hit any of us, and when it hits, it can hit very badly. So we\u2019ve just got to make sure that we slow the spread of the disease and strengthen the NHS. And then in good time, we can review the arrangements. It would be a cabinet agreement to change things. Gove refused to answers questions about whether Dominic Raab had been handed responsibilities for defence in case the UK came under attack while Johnson in intensive care. Gove said: \u201cI simply can\u2019t talk about national security matters. There are well developed protocols which are in place and which have been tested robustly over time.\u201d Here\u2019s a fuller transcript of what Gove told the Today programme about Johnson\u2019s condition: The prime minister was taken into hospital on Sunday. He was undergoing a series of tests, his condition deteriorated. And the medical advice was that he should be moved to intensive care at around seven o\u2019clock last night. Just after that, the cabinet were informed but the cabinet secretary convened a telephone call to explain the situation to us. Do you know whether he\u2019s on a ventilator or not? The prime minister is not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support. One of the reasons for being in intensive care is to make sure that whatever support the medical team considered to be appropriate can be provided. The team at St Thomas\u2019 are among some of the some of the finest clinicians in the country. The doctors will be making appropriate medical decisions, and they have our full support in in the amazingly important work that they do it. Do you know whether their diagnosis at the moment is that he does have pneumonia? I\u2019m not aware of that. If there\u2019s any change in his condition, Number 10, will ensure that the country is updated. The decisions that are being made by the medical team, are decisions which require medical expertise, so it\u2019s important that people like me don\u2019t second guess them, but instead support them in the work that they do. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has paid tribute to a heart surgeon at Wales\u2019 largest hospital, who has died after testing positive for Covid-19. Jitendra Rathod, an associate specialist in cardio-thoracic surgery at the University Hospital of Wales, died in the general intensive care ward at the Cardiff site. Drakeford said Rathod was a very senior and highly regarded doctor. In a tribute on its website the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said \u201cJitu\u201d was \u201can incredibly dedicated surgeon who cared deeply for his patients\u201d, adding: \u201cHe was well-liked and greatly respected by one and all.\u201d The health board said he had worked in the department of cardio-thoracic surgery since the mid-1990s and had a brief stint abroad before returning in 2006. The tribute added: \u201cHe was very compassionate and a wonderful human being. His commitment to the specialism was exemplary. He is survived by his wife and two sons. We will miss him greatly.\u201d \u201cThe prime minister is not on a ventilator\u201d, Gove told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He added: \u201cHe has received oxygen support.\u201d He said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d whether Johnson had been diagnosed with pneumonia. Gove also revealed that, like Dominic Raab, he has not spoken to Johnson since he was taken to hospital in Sunday. He said: I\u2019ve been talking to members of the prime minister\u2019s team but not to the prime minister himself. The prime minister has a team around him who ensure that the work of government goes on. Dominic [Raab] takes on the responsibilities of chairing the various meetings that the prime minister would have chaired. But we\u2019re all working together to implement the plan that the prime minister set out in order to try to marshal all the resources of government in the fight against this invisible enemy. We meet collectively, every morning at around 9.15am. Normally, it\u2019s the prime minister who chairs but yesterday and today, it will be Dominic Raab who chairs. Gove also insisted that Johnson has been working less, on doctors\u2019 orders, since being diagnosed with coronavirus. He said: The prime minister has been following medical advice. He\u2019s also had a stripped back diary. And that\u2019s reflected in the medical advice that the prime minister has had. We must all follow the appropriate medical advice, and all of us are discovering that this virus has a malevolence that is truly frightening. The work of government goes on, we have a superb civil service and they have ensured that the machinery is there for decisions to be made by ministers, by medical and scientific experts, and for those decisions to be followed through in a way which enables us to help those on frontline. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has given no new updates on the prime minister\u2019s condition. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Gove said: \u201cAs we speak the prime minister is in intensive care being looked after by his medical team receiving the very, very best care from the team in St Thomas\u2019 and our hopes and prayers are with him and with his family.\u201d He added: \u201cThe prime minister loves this country, he is someone who always wants to be doing his best, driving things forward, making a difference for the better. We all hope he can be restored to health as quickly as possible.\u201d Here are some of the best wishes sent to Johnson by his fellow world leaders: There has been \u201cno change\u201d in Boris Johnson\u2019s condition, according to Reuters citing two sources close to him. Johnson was given oxygen on Monday and taken to an intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has wished the prime minister a speedy recovery. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: Our thoughts are with the prime minister. We all rooting for him because he is our nation\u2019s prime minister. We need him back, leading the fight to beat this virus. But he\u2019s not just a politician, he\u2019s a father, he expecting a child. This must be on imaginably awful for his loved ones. We send our best wishes and I know he\u2019ll be receiving exceptional care from our brilliant NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019. These are the most extraordinary unprecedented times, and it is a is a health crisis, like we haven\u2019t seen in our lifetimes. It\u2019s a global healthcare crisis combined with being an economic crisis \u2026 The government have been very good at keeping us informed \u2026 We\u2019ve been offering our suggestions we\u2019ve been asking questions, and we\u2019ve been trying our best to raise issues in order to help the government strengthen its response to the crisis. Will Walden, a friend of Boris Johnson and his former director of communications during his time as London mayor, said the prime minister is a \u201creally, really strong guy\u201d and \u201cfar fitter than he looks\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Walden said: He will whip anybody\u2019s backside on a tennis court, he runs regularly, he doesn\u2019t smoke, he drinks moderately. So I think if anyone is in a good position both physically and mentally to fight off the disease then the prime minister is that person. I had a brief exchange with him last week in which I was more concerned about him being in isolation and what he said back to me was: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to beat it\u2019. What he meant by that, which is typical of Boris, is we as a country will come together and beat this disease, rather than thinking about himself in regard to that - and that\u2019s pretty typical of the man. The sharp decline in Boris Johnson\u2019s health makes for a series of grave front pages on Tuesday. The Times\u2019 headline reads \u201cPM in intensive care\u201d and reports on sources saying that Johnson needed four litres of oxygen. The papers says this is well below the normal threshold of 15 litres and suggests the prime minister\u2019s case is not as serious as some admitted to ICU. The Mirror says \u201cSick Boris faces fight for life\u201d across a picture of a pallid-looking Johnson taken from a government video last week. It agrees that the PM\u2019s illness \u201craises some awkward questions\u201d for the way the country is being run and says cabinet ministers will never be forgiven if they are seen to be scoring points off each other in a fight for a potential succession. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog as we wait for news about the condition of Boris Johnson. The prime minister spent a night being treated in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator, but there has been no indication so far that he has been put on a ventilator \u2013 a process that would require hime being sedated. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently standing in for Johnson and has vowed to follow set by the prime minister. Johnson was understood to be conscious when he was moved to intensive care at about 7pm. Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London , said the PM could be given a breathing aid known as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and full ventilation. CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs. But Prof Hill said many Covid-19 patients eventually \u201cprogress to invasive ventilation\u201d. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves. A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient\u2019s own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tube is guided through the mouth into the windpipe. The death rate of those admitted to intensive care in the UK with Covid-19 has topped 50%, according to the latest figures. The figure comes from data compiled by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre based on a sample of 2,249 coronavirus patients. The data showed of the 690 patients in the sample whose care outcomes were known, 346 - 50.1% - had died, while 344 had been discharged. The remaining patients, 1,559, were reported still to be in critical care. The data shows that of 2,248 patients, 73% were men and 27% were women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
