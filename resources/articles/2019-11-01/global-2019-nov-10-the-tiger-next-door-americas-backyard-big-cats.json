Sergeant Jason Alderete of Houston Police Department\u2019s animal cruelty unit, later told a local TV station: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the effects of the drugs. There was an actual tiger!\u201d The animal was given a name, Loki, and sent to an animal sanctuary in the country, run by the Humane Society of the United States. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Loki\u2019s experience was an isolated incident \u2013 it isn\u2019t. An oft-quoted statistic is that there are more tigers in American back yards than there are left in the wild. According to the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, there are between 3,200 and 3,500 tigers remaining in the wild globally. By some estimates there are 5,000 in captivity in the US, though there might be more. The truth is we have little idea how many there are in American ranches, unlicensed zoos, apartments, truck stops and private breeding facilities, due to a mishmash of state, federal and county laws governing their ownership. According to the World Wildlife Fund, only 6% of America\u2019s captive tiger population lives in zoos and facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums; the rest are in private hands. Some are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture and others by state laws, but some are not regulated at all. \u201cIn some states, it is easier to buy a tiger than to adopt a dog from a local animal shelter,\u201d says the WWF. In Texas, which lets each of its 254 counties regulate the ownership of dangerous wild animals, it\u2019s hard to accurately gauge how many there are. In a state that prides itself on promoting individual freedoms, like openly carrying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles or bringing concealed handguns on to university campuses, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that owning a tiger is considered (by some) to be a God-given right. The deplorable conditions in which Loki was found illustrate the fact that these \u201crights\u201d can come at a cost. He was discovered in a 5ft x 3ft cage in the dark garage of the abandoned home. The cage\u2019s floor was made of plywood. It was three months before police arrested his owner, a 24-year-old woman named Brittany Garza, who was taken into custody and charged with animal cruelty. She responded that she was in the process of relocating and had not abandoned the animal, as it had food and water. Katie Jarl, the Humane Society\u2019s southwest regional director, says there have been numerous similar incidents. In 2016, police in Conroe, a town north of Houston, received reports of a tiger roaming a residential neighbourhood after it escaped from someone\u2019s back yard. \u201cNo one knew about them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were completely off the map.\u201d In 2009, a 330lb tiger escaped from its enclosure in Ingram, Texas, and was found in a 79-year-old woman\u2019s back yard. In 2007, a one-year-old tiger \u201cwearing a makeshift lead\u201d was found shot dead in a wooded area off the motorway in Dallas. In 2003, in another Dallas suburb, a motorist spotted a four-month-old tiger roaming the side of the road. In 2001, a three-year-old boy was killed by one of his relative\u2019s three pet tigers in Lee County, Texas. And in 2000, animal control officers near Houston spent three hours searching for a tiger that had escaped from a garden cage while its owners were out of town. That same year, in Channelview, Texas, a three-year-old boy had his arm ripped off by his uncle\u2019s 400lb pet. As for Loki, Jarl says a law-enforcement source of hers outside the city had got in touch to say the authorities had known about Loki\u2019s owner for a long time. \u201cShe had been raising cubs in her home for years,\u201d Jarl says, \u201cin a county where there were no restrictions.\u201d This year, two state legislators filed bills aimed at prohibiting the private ownership of \u201cdangerous wild animals\u201d. But this is Texas, where the private ownership of pretty much everything is sacrosanct, and neither bill became law. There was \u201cpassionate testimony\u201d on both sides of the debate, says the assistant to one of the legislators involved. According to one conservation charity, four states (Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin) do not regulate the private ownership of exotic pets at all. Brittany Peet, director of Captive Animal Law Enforcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), says there are a \u201cpatchwork of laws\u201d regulating the possession of big cats. \u201cAnd you can usually get around those laws by applying for a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor\u2019s licence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as filling out an application and writing a cheque for $100. The regulations are very minimal \u2013 as long as you have a cage where the animal can fully stand up and turn around you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting a licence. \u201cEveryone should be terrified and shocked by this,\u201d Peet adds. \u201cThese animals are extremely complex and powerful and can kill a human being with a swipe of their paw. People keeping tigers in back yards are not experts. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re not providing these animals with enrichment and stimulation that they need in order to live relatively normal lives in captivity.\u201d Bill Rathburn disagrees. He believes he provided the seven tigers that once lived on his private, 50-acre ranch 80 miles east of Dallas, with more than enough enrichment and stimulation. For more than two decades, Rathburn and his now ex-wife Lou raised the animals from cubs. For the Rathburns, the tigers were a surrogate family. I interview Rathburn over the phone and later he sends me a photo of himself and Raja, the first tiger he and his wife bought. The pair are nose to nose inside its cage. \u201cThat was the relationship I had with him,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not a reckless person and wouldn\u2019t have gone into the cage with him if I hadn\u2019t raised him, or knew I\u2019d be safe doing it. He was the most loving animal from the day we got him to the day he died.\u201d Not everyone in the Rathburns\u2019 neighbourhood shared their enthusiasm. \u201cTiger sanctuary has residents growling,\u201d read one local headline. Rathburn is a former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief of police of the Dallas Police Department. In 1996 he was director of security for the summer Olympic Games, in Atlanta. It was while he was there that Lou bought their first tiger. Rathburn admits to feeling \u201ckind of overwhelmed\u201d initially, thinking about all the work and expense that would inevitably go into raising it. But when he came home he says he \u201cimmediately fell in love\u201d. The following year the couple bought two more tiger cubs \u201cfrom a guy who had tigers in the back yard of his house in Houston\u201d. Rathburn and his wife raised the cubs in their house. They installed a heavy mesh screen door \u201cso they couldn\u2019t get out of the pantry and wander round the house at night\u201d. Outside, they constructed a cage complex. \u201cIf you saw it,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019d realise it was a pretty good life for a tiger: a 10,000sqft play area with grass, trees and bushes, so they could run, play, hide, and chew on grass to help their digestive system.\u201d Raja lived to be 21. \u201cHe was unsteady on his feet towards the end,\u201d Rathburn says. \u201cI knew it was time to put him down. The vet came round and agreed. I was crying like a baby. It broke my heart.\u201d Their second animal developed a tumour on her spine. When she died, Lou insisted on having her skin made into a rug. \u201cAnd after we got divorced I ended up with the rug,\u201d Rathburn says. \u201cI have it over a chest in my bedroom, and it\u2019s wonderful way to remember her. I talk to her once in a while.\u201d Eventually, he says, a neighbour complained to county officials about what they described as a growing tiger problem next door. \u201cHe got county officials upset, and two votes can sway an election in a rural area. So the county commissioners weren\u2019t willing to extend my permit.\u201d Rathburn believes in regulation. \u201cThere should be adequate confinement areas, [and regulation] protecting animals and protecting people who might be injured by them.\u201d But, he says, he stands by the rights of individuals to own big cats. While this might sound incredible to someone in the UK, Rathburn\u2019s sense of entitlement \u2013 this rugged individualism that says the government shouldn\u2019t interfere with an individual\u2019s right to own pretty much whatever they want \u2013 runs deep in America. Marcus Cook has owned and worked with big cats since the early 1990s. Back then he was working for a zoo in south Texas, and when the owners retired and closed their business Cook adopted a couple of black leopards. \u201cAnyone who says they can tame one is unrealistic,\u201d he tells me by phone one morning from his home in Kaufman, Texas. \u201cBut they\u2019re handleable.\u201d Cook says he\u2019s owned everything \u201cfrom small cats, like cougars, to lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars. The big guys.\u201d He says his own firm, Zoocats, began as a hobby in 1995 and grew from there. He began to take the animals on the road around the US \u2013 to schools and fairs and temporary exhibits. Cook says it was all about education \u2013 \u201ccreating an entertaining wow factor\u201d \u2013 but his critics say he was ruthlessly exploiting the animals for gain. He has been accused of numerous animal welfare violations, subjected to various complaints, and issued citations over the years. Loki, the tiger rescued from the Houston garage, was taken to a vast ranch in Murchison, Texas, run by the Humane Society. Murchison, population 594, is a rural farming community 70 miles southeast of Dallas. The Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch is situated discreetly, a few miles outside town, next to a remote country lane. You can see horses and cattle grazing in fields next to the road, but none of the exotic animals that also live here. Noelle Almrud, ranch director, meets me at the main office and we climb into a truck to drive to the enclosures at the back of the ranch that house its two tigers. It\u2019s not unlike a wildlife park, although there are no gawking tourists here and the enclosures are bigger. Loki lives in a quarter-acre fenced area, but he rotates each week from this into a three-acre enclosure next door. Both have an abundance of willows and oaks to provide shade. As we walk towards the fence, Loki gallops over and makes a breathy snort that Almrud says is known as \u201cchuffing\u201d and signals affection. He rubs himself against the wire enclosure before running back to his water trough and jumping in. \u201cHe\u2019s acclimated really well,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe feed him 8lb of food a day \u2013 humanely raised beef, turkey, large rats, or rabbits and supplements \u2013 six days a week, then he has a day of fasting, as he would in the wild.\u201d Two years ago, Almrud helped found the Big Cat Sanctuary Alliance, a network of reputable big cat sanctuaries whose mission was to strengthen the regulation of big cats in the US and get conservation facilities to work together to place rescue animals. But they face a big challenge, she explains: \u201cRoadside zoos need shutting down, but where do you put all the animals? You couldn\u2019t re-house all the tigers currently in roadside zoos in America. We need more money and more facilities. In a perfect world,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019d like to be put out of business.\u201d Judging by the Texan appetite for big cats, that won\u2019t be happening anytime soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
