Of course,\u201d he said, as the \u00d6zil debate dominated the agenda before Arsenal\u2019s trip to Villa Park on Saturday. Wenger did add that he feels pressure as a manager to make \u00d6zil a success. \u201cI feel that responsibility exactly the same for a player who cost \u00a31. When I see a talent, for any player, I think how can I get the best out of him. That is not linked with price. It is just a coincidence that the market is like it is. \u201cHe\u2019s a confident boy. This guy has played for the German national team and won the World Cup playing wide and nobody found a word to say. He has been criticised during the World Cup and still played well and he was always in every single team. He can be a top player.\u201d That wider role is a sticking point at the moment, as \u00d6zil is straining to influence Premier League games from a wider position. Wenger takes inspiration from some legendary sides of old as he tries to create a game plan to get the best out of the collection of No10s he has assembled. \u201cZidane went to Real Madrid for \u00a382m and he played on the left. There was never a debate and he had to play there,\u201d Wenger argues. \u201cBecause in the middle they had Raul and Ronaldo he made room and played on the left. When you have the ball you play where you want and go where you want. \u201cIt is a debate as old as the world. Since we played football. When you look at the Brazil team in 1970 they had Tost\u00e3o, Rivelino, Pel\u00e9, Jairzinho, Gerson, Clodoaldo, They all played No10 in their clubs. They put them all together and they won the World Cup in a convincing way. \u201cWhat is Wilshere but basically a No10? He played his whole life at No10. Somebody had to go out there. Is it Wilshere, \u00d6zil, Ramsey? Nobody is really natural out wide. So you keep good players out or you try to get them together.\u201d At various points this season already Wenger has tried each of those players, plus Santi Cazorla and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, as his central playmaker. It smacks of a certain indecision but Wenger is hopeful that a fluid system that accommodates the best of the creative talent at his disposal will eventually come good. Trying to be the new 1970 Brazil in the modern game sounds ambitious. \u201cIt is,\u201d says Wenger, \u201cbut without ambition you cannot progress. We have that desire to play well all together and I think we can really achieve it. We can have a fantastic team.\u201d Who would be this team\u2019s Pel\u00e9? \u201cThere is no Pel\u00e9,\u201d says Wenger. \u201cPel\u00e9 scored 1,300 goals. I asked Mario Zagallo \u2013 who played with the best Brazilians, who managed Brazil, who has seen all of the best Brazilians right up until today \u2013 who is the best Brazilian you have seen, and he said Pel\u00e9, together with Garrincha.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
