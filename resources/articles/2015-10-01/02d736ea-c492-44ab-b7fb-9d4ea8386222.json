Not only did their name feature a creature of the American woods at a time when foxes, deer, wolves and bears of both panda and grizzly breeds were in high demand, but their music matched the family-friendly folk-pop thus signified. Boy &amp; Bear\u2019s 2013 album Harlequin Dream had a bit of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s everyman allure and a bit of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s guilty pleasure party vibe. They shied short of whistling but, still, the five men from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches seemed one Blundstone boot away from writing a world-conquering anthem like Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. They didn\u2019t, but Harlequin Dream did debut at No 1 on the Aria charts. Limit of Love, however, doesn\u2019t test anyone\u2019s limits. To its merit, it is crisper and less rustic than the previous two albums but when Spotify glides into the band\u2019s back catalogue, it\u2019s doubtful you\u2019ll notice. The most interesting thing about this record is something far less pindownable: a kind of gleaming self-awareness of its own imminent success. The single Walk the Wire encapsulates this sensation best. It leaps from the starting gates as sleek and hungry as a Melbourne Cup favourite no one can wrest their eyes from until it streaks past the finishing line. There are only two synthesiser notes and a handful more on guitar and bass but they\u2019re so effective they seem lab-tested. This song is impossible not to like \u2013 Boy &amp; Bear know this, everyone knows this \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t change the fact low odds also mean low stakes and it\u2019s never quite as fun when the favourite wins. Hoskings\u2019 voice is impressive across the album but at its most nuanced in the single\u2019s opening lines, into which he projects genuine unease. \u201cIt was the strangest night / The kind of scene I don\u2019t fit into.\u201d He must be working some special voodoo throughout Walk the Wire, in fact, because damned if I don\u2019t feel a stab of sympathy when he sings: \u201cI\u2019m just a man, all right? / And I\u2019m fumbling.\u201d Fumbling in a romantic sense, only. While no track matches the thoroughbred single, there are no duds either. Songs such as Hollow Ground and Where\u2019d You Go? are pinned to little more than a simple chord or two or a few piano licks; no flab, all feelgood pop songs unsweetened by the affable disillusion in Hoskings\u2019 voice, featuring lyrics so platitudinal that if you only half listen, they\u2019re about you, me and everyone we know. When the sheen of the single starts to tarnish from repeat listens, the second last track Just Dumb, plays the long game. By now, Hoskings\u2019 permanent state of inexplicable forlorn is starting to come off as one-dimensional so this self-effacing slow jam comes just in time: as tender as Snakadaktal and with sweetly ambivalent guitar picking reminiscent of Yo La Tengo. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m right / Maybe I\u2019m wrong / Maybe I\u2019m just dumb,\u201d Hoskings sings. It\u2019s wistful and inarguably lovely. Ultimately, we know how this will all pan out. Limit of Love will polarise no one. It will bring daytime-dancing bliss to sunburnt festival crowds and it will be played a lot on the radio. The album has already hit No 1 on the Aria charts. And the guys will cram genially into radio studios \u2013 pros, by now \u2013 and talk about how it was recorded with minimal fuss in Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World studio and, later, in a rental on the New South Wales south coast, an experience Hoskings describes in the press release as: \u201cJust being with the boys, in a space where you have gear set up, you have fridge full of great food and wine, playing music and surfing.\u201d I don\u2019t begrudge Boy &amp; Bear the comfortable privilege captured so neatly in Hoskings\u2019 words. It just doesn\u2019t foment very interesting music. This is a band whose ongoing popularity in Australia is assured to a large degree because Triple J remains such a powerful tastemaker but seems guided less by attendance to a musical meritocracy and more by a \u201conce playlisted, always playlisted\u201d rulebook. Perhaps as a result, indie rock fans here develop terminal lockjaw after they bite down on a band. This loyalty affords bands an enviably long creative leash. So why do so many, like Boy &amp; Bear, stay in perennial mid-flight? Why do so few crash, burn, weird things out or perhaps even soar? \u2022 Limit of Love is out on Universal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
