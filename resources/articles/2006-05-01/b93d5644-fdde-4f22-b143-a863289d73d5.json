I said: Diamond in building row", "bodyText": "There are two types of people in the world, according to Bill Murray's character in the movie What About Bob? - those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't. Diamond's next-door neighbour on New York's Upper East Side, it seems, falls into the latter category. The man responsible for hits such as I'm A Believer and Song Sung Blue is suing Marianne Nestor, widow of the fashion designer Oleg Cassini, because he says building work on her house is ruining the \"serene environment\" of his roof terrace. Demonstrating that he is indeed a believer, not only in the power of love but also in New York's strict building regulations, Diamond is suing Ms Nestor over a copper and steel construction that he says \"illegally adds 13 feet [4 metres] to the height of the building\". The lawsuit, filed last week but made public only this week, alleges the structure at number 15 East 63rd Street, apparently part of an air-conditioning system, damages Diamond's enjoyment of his terrace at number 17. \"The value of his apartment has been substantially diminished and the construction has irreparably damaged his enjoyment of his apartment and rooftop ... The only way in which the injuries to plaintiff can be cured is by removal of the offending construction,\" according to the suit. Papers claims Ms Nestor, who shares the house with her sister, Peggy, has already been fined over the building work. Regulations limit the height of buildings in the neighbourhood to 23 metres (75ft). Diamond is the 25th highest-selling artist in American history, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. With 48m records sold, he is tied with Kenny G."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
