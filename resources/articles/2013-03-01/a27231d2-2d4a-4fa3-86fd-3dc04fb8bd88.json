Not that Paul Simon's 40-year-old son is much of child any more. His 2010 debut was country-folk-pop in a style his dad would have recognised, but Division Street massively amps up a strand that was evident briefly on its predecessor \u2013 the influence of cult 90s chamber-popper Eric Matthews.He does so not through employing strings and brass, like Matthews, but via the layering of his reedy but attractive voice, often distanced from the instrumentation, and through an odd but attractive stateliness in the music. Others have detected a strong desire to be Elliott Smith in these recordings (Smith's producer, Tom Rothrock, is at the desk here), but the melancholy never spills over into misery and the tunes are indelible. Only on Just Like St Teresa does the spectre of dad pop up, and on 99 Simon pulls out the kind of effortless, breezy powerpop moments that Evan Dando used to essay at will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
