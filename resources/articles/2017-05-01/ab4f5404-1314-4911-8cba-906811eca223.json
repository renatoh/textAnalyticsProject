Art historians have struggled to find information about the woman whose illegitimate son became the artistic genius who painted Mona Lisa. With only a possible first name \u2013 Caterina \u2013 there has been speculation that she was a peasant or even a slave from north Africa. Beyond that, there is little to go on. Now, almost six centuries later, one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on Leonardo has given a far fuller account of her story, piecing together her son\u2019s world using previously overlooked documents. According to Professor Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, Leonardo\u2019s mother was Caterina di Meo Lippi, a poor and vulnerable orphan, and only 15 when she was seduced by a lawyer. She had been living with her grandmother in a decrepit farmhouse, about a mile from Vinci in the Tuscan hills. Kemp makes his claims in a book out next month, Mona Lisa: The People and the Painting, written with Dr Giuseppe Pallanti, an economist and art researcher. Newly unearthed documents also cast light on the portrait\u2019s famed sitter, Lisa del Giocondo, and her husband, Francesco. Far from being a genteel Florentine silk merchant, as previously supposed, he was \u201ca sharp operator\u201d, trading in sugar from Madeira, leather from Ireland, property, money \u2013 and slaves, Kemp believes, judging from evidence of regular purchases of female slaves. The professors\u2019 research will also challenge the generally recognised site of Leonardo\u2019s birth, on 15 April 1452 \u2013 the so-called Casa Natale in Anchiano, two miles from Vinci. Comprising two adjoining buildings, the Casa has become a place of pilgrimage for tourists, but documents suggest that art lovers have been visiting the wrong site. He believes the birthplace was more likely to have been the house of his paternal grandfather in Vinci, where Leonardo grew up. Kemp said: \u201cLeonardo is the subject of absolutely extraordinary public interest. So getting the reality of his life sorted out is a matter of great consequence.\u201d The new insights follow a trawl through 15th-century financial documents held within the archives of Vinci and Florence. They have proved a goldmine, having been apparently overlooked by other art historians. Much of the new evidence comes from property taxation returns. Kemp said: \u201cTuscany set up a very early system of wealth tax and rates on the value of a property. So this is an absolutely fantastic record because everyone had to submit returns \u2026 Of course, everyone pleads poverty. They all say \u2018this house is falling down\u2019, but inspectors went round. \u201cIn the case of Vinci, they verified that Caterina\u2019s father, who seems to be pretty useless, had a rickety house which wasn\u2019t lived in and they couldn\u2019t tax him ... He had disappeared and then apparently died young. So Caterina\u2019s was a real sob story.\u201d Caterina had an infant stepbrother, Papo, and her grandmother died shortly before 1451, leaving them with no assets or support, apart from an uncle with a \u201chalf-ruined\u201d house and cattle. According to Kemp, she was seduced by 25-year-old Ser Piero da Vinci, an ambitious lawyer working in Florence. Documents show that he took a break in July 1451, \u201cexactly the right weeks for her impregnation\u201d, Kemp said. \u201cNice, spring evening probably in the fields \u2013 and that was it.\u201d The lawyer himself was due to get married and Kemp believes that his family would have also provided Caterina with a modest dowry. This would explain how \u2013 with no means or possessions \u2013 she was married off quickly to Antonio di Piero Buti, a local farmer \u201cfrom her own stratum of society\u201d. Leonardo was nurtured in the nearby house of his grandfather, Antonio da Vinci. Such arrangements were not uncommon then, Kemp said. Antonio\u2019s 1457 tax return lists family members, including Ser Piero\u2019s illegitimate son, as \u201cborn of him and of Caterina\u201d. Documents show that Caterina went on to have a second son and four daughters, only a few miles away from her first son. They reveal a further link between the lawyer and Caterina: he conducted a minor legal transaction for her husband. Kemp hopes his work will put an end to \u201ctotally implausible myths\u201d that have built up about Leonardo\u2019s life. \u201cWhat had become progressively attractive in the public domain,\u201d he says, \u201cwas that Caterina was a slave, an African slave, or even an Oriental slave. Caterina was a name that tends to be given to slaves.\u201d Kemp acknowledged that the research would be \u201cdisconcerting\u201d for the Vinci authorities, which have turned the Casa Natale into a tourist attraction. \u201cWhen I first went there, there were just basically stone shells ... They\u2019ve now got multimedia displays, car parks and have been cosmetically improved.\u201d His book pokes fun at historians who have tried to make their name with new theories about Mona Lisa \u2013 \u201cthat she is Leonardo in drag \u2026 that she is a \u2018lady of the night\u2019.\u201d As he says, \u201cthe legends become more true than the truths.\u201d Why had so many significant documents been ignored until now? \u201cIt never fails to amaze you that the obvious moves haven\u2019t been made,\u201d said Kemp. \u201cArchives are not tackled because, in current academia, you need to get quick results rather than slogging through material with no guarantees of returns.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
