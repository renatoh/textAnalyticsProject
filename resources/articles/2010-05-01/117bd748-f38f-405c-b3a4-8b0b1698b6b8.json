I do. Although I call it mutual positive transference and I don't necessarily regard it as a fortuitous circumstance. Transference is something we all do: it is when we make unconscious assumptions about the person before us based on our experience of people we have known in the past. Often when we've had a bonding experience with, for example, a carer from our infancy, we may meet someone who looks at us in the same way or speaks with the same rhythms and we may feel what could be called \"chemistry\". Consciously we may think that we prefer a \"type\" of person, but this is prejudice. Transference isn't as conscious as that, but it can cause a feeling that is charged and one that we notice. Because something feels familiar it can feel \"right\", but it does not follow that it is all good \u2013 it might just be familiar. This is why some have a pattern of falling for the same \"wrong\" types. Transference is passive \u2013 probably why we talk of \"falling\" in love. When you fall in love, you trip over transference. Sometimes you'll fall on your feet, and sometimes when reality intrudes, the positive transference fades and takes love with it. So how can you tell if it is really love? I see loving another person as an action. Actions such as: listening, caring, dialogue, appreciation, mutual impact and priority. Actions backed up with commitment. And if a little of the positive transference lingers, it does love no harm. Visit the School of Life at schooloflife.com. Philippa Perry is a writer and psychotherapist.
