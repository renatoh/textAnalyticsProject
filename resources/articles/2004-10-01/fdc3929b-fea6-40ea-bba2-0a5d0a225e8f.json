As politicians and broadcasters mither on about the disaffection of voters, this is the great opportunity to connect political issues with a mass audience - to bring the choices facing the nation right into the electorate's homes. The American example should convince the sceptics. The standard argument against debates is that they are Roman circuses: gaudy, crowd-pleasing events that are all about show. The purists cluck about the superficiality of television, and claim it ends up being a contest determined by make-up artists and spin doctors. Baloney. The debates between Bush and Kerry and Cheney and Edwards have been incredibly illuminating about the men and their policies. The chairing of the debates has been classy, while the locations have added to the sense of occasion. Do we really think we couldn't manage that in the mother of democracies? It's true that debates put candidates in a spotlight and under pressure. But if they can't handle answering questions in front of millions of people, it's unlikely they're going to be much good in an international crisis. It would be daft to pretend that television doesn't have some artificialities, but there's little evidence that it distorts. The Bush cutaway shots in the first debate were damaging because commentators believed it was a glimpse of the real man. And few would argue that Nixon had a nobler character than Kennedy, however much he was let down by his sweat glands. So we should have debates in Britain. They should be lengthy, testing and rigorous; and the American format would work with only a few modifications. The most obvious is that Britain is a multi-party democracy, so broadcasters would have to make sure they were being fair in their allocation of airtime - but I've no doubt this is achievable without the Prime Minister having to face the Monster Raving Loony Party. The key debates should be a co-operative venture between the main broadcasters: demo cracy is more important than channel rivalry. The only block, of course, is the politicians themselves. It's understandable: no favourite ever wants to share airtime with someone seen as an also-ran. The prize for our civic life, though, is enormous. Voters would tune in by the million, and they would be empowered to make their choice having seen the leaders set out their case, not in the yah-boo cauldron of Westminster, but via the medium that still dominates our age. Politicians can snipe about television's alleged triviality, but here is a platform they can use for the ultimate public service. Our offer is there; we're waiting for their call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
