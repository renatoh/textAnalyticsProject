Inside Dior \u2013 which airs on More4 on Thursday night \u2013 is a classic example of this irksome new genre. The show examines the installation of a new creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, at Dior, one of the biggest luxury brands in the world. Dior is kind of a big deal commercially, registering sales of $41.6bn (\u00a333.1bn) in 2016, but the documentary-makers interview its staff using the tone of voice one might employ to ask a toddler whether they are enjoying their ice-cream. \u201cWere you finding it difficult to turn around?\u201d an invisible interrogator asks a model, as she practises walking down the catwalk in block heels. His voice practically quivers in anticipation of the mirth about to be unleashed. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he asks another model, who is sitting in a corridor waiting for her fitting. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude. I\u2019m reading it in Dutch.\u201d The camera lingers, presumably giving the viewer time to process the stupendous occurrence that a young woman who works in the fashion industry could enjoy Nobel prize-winning magic realism. Inside Dior comes hot on the heels of Absolutely Fashion, the BBC2 documentary that purported to expose life behind the scenes at British Vogue, but actually revealed very little. During a year of unprecedented access, the filmmaker spent a great deal of time asking patronising questions, eyerolling at Vogue staffers\u2019 love of fashion and expressing astonishment when he learned that some were Oxbridge-educated. He missed the scoop taking place under his nose \u2013 the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s first fashion photoshoot \u2013 and fluffed a split-second encounter with Kate Moss, which played out as follows: Interviewer: \u201cHow many covers have you done for them?\u201d Moss: \u201cThirty-six.\u201d Interviewer: \u201cThat\u2019s a record that\u2019s unlikely to be broken, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Moss: \u201cI dunno.\u201d Interviewer: \u201cWhat has Vogue done for your career?\u201d Moss: \u201cOh, they\u2019re everything ... I hate being interviewed.\u201d *Exit stage right* Inside Dior is more successful. There are fascinating shots of the rarely seen couture clients who keep lapdogs in Chanel-branded supermarket baskets, and the interviewer asks worthwhile, difficult questions about models and body image. Still, the condescension cannot be avoided. Its apex occurs during an interview with Peter Philips, creative and image director of Christian Dior makeup. \u201cYou have real skills,\u201d the interviewer tells Philips during their exchange, as though throwing him a bone. Philips \u2013 arguably the most powerful and influential person working in the cosmetics industry \u2013 responds with a bemused laugh and says: \u201cI hope so. Spread the word!\u201d Imagine this conversation taking place in any other \u2013 any male-dominated \u2013 industry. Imagine a pundit saying: \u201cYou have real skills\u201d to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho during a post-match analysis, or a food critic chewing on Heston Blumental\u2019s meat fruit and declaring: \u201cYou have real skills.\u201d Just imagine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
