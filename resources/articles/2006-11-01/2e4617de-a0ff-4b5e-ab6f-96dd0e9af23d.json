How this can happen to a lump of toughened plastic designed to withstand soaring heat, torrential rain and freezing cold, not to mention the odd impact with a lamppost, I cannot say. But now, in the mornings, once I've managed to prise it apart sufficiently enough to force the thing over my ears, it feels as if my head's being tested for blood pressure. Come to think of it, my motorcycle jacket and trousers seem to have shrunk, too - and, bizarrely, only since arriving in Italy. I shall write to the various manufacturers demanding an explanation. I am pondering the incredible shrinking equipment when my waitress interrupts to ask if I'm ready for my next course. I had opted for the Food of Sardinia taster menu, without realising that this meant all the food in Sardinia. Having ploughed my way through three different plates of mushrooms, prosciutto, salami, devilled lambs' kidneys and olives, accompanied by a log-basket of flatbreads, followed by ravioli stuffed with cheese, macaroni and a couple of frattau - crepes smothered with fried egg and drizzled with tomatoes and herbs - then half a suckling pig stuffed with myrtle and bay leaves attended by a brace of sausages the thickness of hawsers, I was indeed ready for my trolley load of cakes. So it's not as if I'm overeating and I am managing to get plenty of exercise, what with sitting on a motorcycle all day and then there was that time back in Hungary, three months ago, when a broken lift meant I had to walk up two flights of stairs. As I said, I shall be writing to the manufacturers. The next day, and I hook up with a bunch of bikers from Rome riding up Sardinia's spectacular west coast, its alabaster beaches washed by surely the bluest sea in the world. In a group of 12, 11 are divorced, a phenomenon I've seen time and again on this trip: groups of newly single, middle-aged guys reacting to marital upheaval by jumping on their motorcycles and hitting the road. 'But why do men react by going off with other men?' I ask Gianfranco during a cigarette break, but my Italian is not so great and I'm pretty certain, judging by the look on his face, that I've just accused him of being a homosexual. I change the subject by trying to ask him if his helmet has ever shrunk, and when we set off once more the group rides so quickly along the twisting cornice that I can't keep up. Alone once more, I stop off at some ruins and meet a fabulous woman with perfect English. 'Sardinia was colonised by the Phoenicians and Romans,' she purrs and, often going for weeks without nuanced conversation, I am spellbound. 'Followed by the Pisans the Genoese and the Spaniards.' And she is so knowledgeable and her voice so sexy, so mellifluous, that I might just be falling in love. 'The tour is over. Please return this audiophone to the ticket office,' the voice says and I think that if it has come to this, maybe I should seriously consider going home soon. Over to Corsica, the Mediterranean islands serving me as a series of vast stepping stones, and a return to a place that has haunted me for the past couple of years. For back then, my soon-to-be-ex-wife and I stupidly agreed to honour our commitment to a long-booked holiday with another couple. A happy couple. My wife's eyes sparkled with the future - oh, that all makes sense now - but the misery of that week, the separate bedrooms, the foursomes for dinner, my desperate, pointless attempts to prove myself still worthy of her, left me hollowed out and broken. It was probably the worst week of my life. Throughout this trip I have been revisiting places where we holidayed together - Romania, the Turkish coast, Greek islands, Croatia - places I thought now so tainted with sadness that I'd have to avoid them forever. But one by one I have been reclaiming them for myself, and it feels like splashing on a new coat of paint; what lies underneath will always be there, but that's not necessarily the thing I now see. I stare over the fence of the Corsican villa, its windows shuttered for the winter, the grass overgrown and littered with decaying leaves blowing in the cold north wind. I look at my motorcycle and think about the journey that has brought me here, back to this place. I close my eyes and try to recapture the wretchedness I felt the last time I was stood here, but I cannot. For, finally, miraculously, it seems that those people have gone and only shadows remain. Above me, thousands of starlings fly as one, the black mass dancing across the sky in pulsing waves before exploding like a vast firework."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
