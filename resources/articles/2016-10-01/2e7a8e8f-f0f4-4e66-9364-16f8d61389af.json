Tensions were running high. The week before, two soldiers from the regiment had been killed and another two seriously injured in IED attacks. According to testimony filed in court by one of the team, which was retracted and then resubmitted, they entered the house and found an \u201cunknown male \u2026 messing about with an EFP (explosively formed penetrator) IED.\u201d The unknown male was Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed who alleges that after being assaulted he was bundled into a vehicle by the soldiers who threw an acidic liquid into his eyes and used what felt like \u201ccutter pliers\u201d to \u201cpinch and twist\u201d his skin. The Ministry of Defence contends that the injuries were inflicted by the Mahdi Army before the soldiers had arrived and that Waheed was an insurgent. Now, in a high-profile case that has provoked a furore in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, the armed forces and government and which has come to crystalise the row over \u2018ambulance chasing lawyers\u2019 versus British troops, Waheed is seeking compensation from the MoD for alleged mistreatment and unlawful detention. His is one of three test cases filed against the MoD that will help the judge hearing them, Mr Justice Leggatt, determine how to proceed with a further 600 or so similar claims. The MoD has already opted to settle one of the three cases. This is in addition to about 300 or so other claims it has already settled, paying out almost \u00a320m. About a dozen cases have been dropped. According to his closing submission filed into court, many of Waheed\u2019s claims have gone unchallenged by the MoD. He alleges that he was subject to sensory deprivation, held in solitary confinement and denied adequate shelter, bedding, food and water. The MoD, which declined to call as a witness the Royal Military Police captain assigned to investigate Waheed\u2019s injuries, is resisting his claim for compensation. \u201cOpportunistic claims arising from operations overseas are costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,\u201d a spokeswoman for the MoD explained. \u201cThe MOD will continue to vigorously defend these claims whenever possible.\u201d Records show that shortly after Waheed was captured, a Dr Moy emailed a Major Hazelton of the Royal Military Police. \u201cI have concerns regarding the handling of Internee 91057 [Waheed]. He has arrived at the DTDF [divisional temporary detainment facility] with extensive bruising over his upper back and arms. This bruising is linear, and suggestive of being struck repeatedly with an implement. I suggest that it is unlikely these injuries were sustained during a struggle; he appears to have been deliberately beaten.\u201d Within hours of Waheed being picked up, investigators with the army\u2019s joint forward intelligence team (JFIT) expressed doubts about their captive. \u201cIt is now possible that 91057 is, in fact, not involved in the manufacture of IEDs,\u201d one JFIT email states. \u201cHowever, we have yet to reliably establish the full extent of his involvement.\u201d A few days later another email noted: \u201cThe subject can provide no more information on Ali Jaleel [a suspected bombmaker and the chief target of the raid] and that he has not been involved in any militant activities.\u201d An email on 24 February 2007 \u2013 almost a fortnight after Waheed was seized \u2013 concluded: \u201cThere is a dearth of exploitable information regarding this subject, and it does appear to the JFIT that this is a case of \u2018wrong place, wrong time\u2019. He has shown his willingness to provide ... any information required.\u201d In March a decision was taken to release Waheed. But what of the soldier\u2019s testimony that Waheed was found with an IED? Documents show that after he was seized, a swab taken from him was run through a particle detector to identify trace residues. The detector showed a one-bar reading, which means, according to the forensic specialist who ran the test, that \u201che was far away from an explosive\u201d. Establishing what happened during the raid - where it is accepted that bombs were discovered - would benefit from photographs or video footage of Waheed\u2019s capture. Guidance on strike operations makes clear such recordings should be taken, but much of the footage, and that of many of Waheed\u2019s interrogation sessions, is missing. The case comes at a combustible time. The Iraq historic allegations team (Ihat), set up by the Labour government to investigate allegations of abuse by British forces, stands accused of hounding former soldiers through the courts. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has complained that they are \u201cvictims of a witch hunt\u201d. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said she is determined to protect the armed forces against \u201cvexatious complaints\u201d and will use this week\u2019s Tory party conference to announce a crackdown on no-win, no-fee lawyers. Yesterday the former head of the armed forces, Lord Dannatt, called for Ihat to be wound down. \u201cThis is a battle between the armed forces, politicians and lawyers, and there is a feeling that lawyers should butt out,\u201d said John Cooper, QC, who has represented the families of armed forces personnel in many cases against the MoD. \u201cLawyers expect to be given as much as we give out, but when politicians start wading in and almost supporting the undermining of legal firms and lawyers for taking cases which, after all, is their job, it becomes very worrying indeed.\u201d About 100 of the 600 or so civil claims \u2013 including that of Waheed \u2013 being brought against the MoD by the law firm Leigh Day have been referred to Ihat, which is now investigating almost 1,500 alleged incidents. Nevertheless, the two discrete legal processes have become conflated in many people\u2019s minds. This is partly due to the fallout from the Al-Sweady Inquiry, the \u00a331m investigation into the alleged abuse of Iraqi detainees, which found that claims of murder and torture against British troops were the result of \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d. Public Interest Lawyers, one of the firms that brought the claims, was closed down after questions were raised about the evidence it presented to the inquiry. Leigh Day meanwhile has been referred by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) to answer allegations about the way it handled some of the cases. The firm denies the allegations and says that the referral to the SRA by the MoD was \u201cpolitical\u201d. Cooper also believes that the backlash against the lawyers confronting the MoD has a political context, taking place as it does amid calls for troops in combat conditions to be exempted from the Human Rights Act: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that when you are in hand -to-hand combat you\u2019ve got to start thinking, does this breach the law? But it should apply in cases where there have been substantiated allegations of torturing people in custody.\u201d That detainees have suffered at the hands of British troops is accepted. Even the Al-Sweady inquiry concluded that some detainees had been mistreated, though not deliberately. Last month three British soldiers who forced an Iraqi teenager into a canal \u2013 a practice known as \u201cwetting\u201d \u2013 which resulted in him drowning were condemned by a judge. The Baha Mousa inquiry concluded that the hotel worker\u2019s death in British army custody was caused by \u201cfactors including lack of food and water, heat, exhaustion, fear, previous injuries and the hooding and stress positions used by British troops \u2013 and a final struggle with his guards\u201d. The inquiry heard that Mousa suffered at least 93 injuries prior to his death in September 2003 and that several practices he was subjected to were banned by UK law and the Geneva convention. Whatever the truth of Waheed\u2019s claims against the MoD, his case, like that of many other detainees bringing actions, highlights the army\u2019s abject failure to anticipate what to do with them once it became an occupying force, a failure identified from the outset by Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Mercer, the army\u2019s chief legal adviser in Iraq. Mercer told the Baha Mousa inquiry: \u201cI was acutely aware of the complete lack of planning for detainees and internees \u2026 and raised this repeatedly through the chain of command.\u201d But in postwar Iraq detainees were not a priority. Among the documents forming part of the Waheed case is the joint forward intelligence team operational directive issued to his interrogators. It urges: \u201cManipulate each internee as you see fit to suit your own ends. Do not worry about upsetting them.\u201d Legal claims against British troops Baha Mousa Inquiry Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist, died in custody in 2003. An inquiry chaired by Sir William Gage found that he had been beaten by large numbers of British soldiers, and subject to sleep deprivation, banned stress positions and hooding. Corporal Donald Payne was convicted of inhuman treatment and jailed for a year. Al-Sweady Inquiry It was alleged that British troops killed 20 unarmed civilians and abused others detained after a battle with Shia insurgents in 2004. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Thayne Forbes, concluded that all the dead had been killed in battle and . the allegations were \u201cwithout merit\u201d. Ihat Established in March 2010, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team was set up by the MoD to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct and abuse of Iraqi civilians by the British armed forces. Ihat has a remit to refer allegations with sufficient evidence to the Service Prosecutions Authority and dispose of those it judges to be baseless. As of March, Ihat was investigating 1,374 cases involving more than 1,500 victims. Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day In April, amid concerns about its use of the evidence, PIL, the law firm behind many of the claims investigated by the Al-Sweady inquiry, was referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and wound up soon after. The MoD has also referred another law firm involved in the Al-Sweady inquiry, Leigh Day, to the SRA. The firm says it intends to contest claims against it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
