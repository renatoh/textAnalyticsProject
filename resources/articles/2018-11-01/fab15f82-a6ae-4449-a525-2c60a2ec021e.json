Five years on, as they gear up for their opening game against the same opposition in St Lucia on Saturday, this time in a World T20, they will be hoping to avoid a similar fate. This time around, the personnel look rather different. Of England\u2019s 15-strong squad, eight did not play in the last World T20 in 2016, and the batter Sophia Dunkley and left-arm spinners Kirstie Gordon and Linsey Smith have never worn an England shirt. In particular, England will feel the loss of their world-class wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who is staying at home in an effort to manage her anxiety condition and Katherine Brunt, the all-rounder who has been ruled out the tournament after scans confirmed a flare-up of her long-standing back problem would not allow her to participate. \u201cIt\u2019s a big loss,\u201d said the England captain, Heather Knight. \u201cBut we knew it was unlikely [Brunt] would play. It was a bit of a risk to bring her out and we were prepared for her not to be fit. We were hopeful we could get her in at 70% because she makes us a better team but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re a very different team to the last 20-over World Cup in 2016,\u201d Knight added. \u201cIn T20 we\u2019ve become a lot more consistent. We\u2019ve played some really exciting cricket recently and chased down 180 a few times. Now it\u2019s about trying to do it on the world stage.\u201d Brunt\u2019s role as a bowling all-rounder who has batted as high as No 4 for England in T20s this year makes a like-for-like replacement difficult. She will be replaced by the Middlesex batter Fran Wilson, who is unlikely to arrive in time for the opening match. Moreover, Taylor\u2019s reserve, Amy Jones, may be almost equally as deft but has yet to prove herself with the bat in the shortest form, with a highest score of 30 to her name. England are the 50-over champions and ranked third in T20, so go into the tournament as strong contenders but much will hang on the performance of their batters. In June, against South Africa at Taunton, the world record total in women\u2019s T20s was broken twice in the same day: women\u2019s T20 cricket is rapidly becoming a batter\u2019s game. England will take heart from that performance, in which they reached 250 for three, thanks to a 47-ball century from Tammy Beaumont. Her opening partner Danni Wyatt has also flourished of late, having hit two T20 centuries in the past 12 months and the Wisden cricketer of the year, Nat Sciver, has also been in fine form, leading Surrey Stars to victory in the Kia Super League. Given Brunt\u2019s absence Sciver, the all-rounder who took 10 wickets in the KSL with her medium pace, is also likely to play an important role with the ball in a squad dominated by spinners. The loss of Brunt may open the way for either Gordon or Smith to make their debut, with the coach Mark Robinson hoping his surfeit of left-arm spinners \u2013 the 19-year-old Sophie Ecclestone makes up the trio \u2013 will make up for any failings in the fast-bowling department. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a union going on,\u201d Ecclestone said. \u201cWe help each other out in training with field settings and general left-arm spinner chat.\u201d England are somewhat fortunate in that they have been drawn in the relatively easy Group A, alongside West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia, New Zealand and India (plus Pakistan and Ireland) make up Group B. England\u2019s biggest group challenge looks to be against the defending champions, West Indies, who dismissed them for 116 in their warm-up, winning by five wickets. Should England top the group they are likely to face New Zealand in the semi-final. While the Kiwis sit above them in the rankings, England\u2019s utter dominance over them in the summer, culminating in a seven-wicket win in the Tri-series final, should leave them confident of victory. A bigger concern will be ensuring they avoid a semi-final against Australia and thus any chance of a repeat of their 2016 encounter in India, whereby they collapsed horribly and lost by five runs. As three-times champions and the No 1 ranked side, Australia pose a formidable threat. With a batting lineup so long the Guardian\u2019s top-rated female cricketer of 2018, Ellyse Perry, features only at No 7, it is easy to see why they are the favourites. Their bowling unit is also threatening, with the young left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux, who finished as leading wicket-taker in their whitewash of Pakistan last month, looking to make her name during the tournament. All 23 matches will be broadcast live, with the decision review system in use for the first time at a T20 World Cup. The standalone tournament, the first of its kind, should be another step forward for the women\u2019s game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
