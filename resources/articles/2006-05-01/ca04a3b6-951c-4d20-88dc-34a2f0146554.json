The 21-year-old seamer from Blackburn presumably gained some insights into the Trent Bridge batsmen in a month's loan in the Midlands and, whether or not that inside knowledge was a factor in his selection in the Lancashire attack ahead of Kyle Hogg, he certainly used it to good effect. The early signs were not promising. After an early wicket for each of Lancashire's new ball veterans Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork had reduced Notts to 24 for two, Newby conceded two fours in each of his first three overs. But then he surprised Darren Bicknell with extra pace to bowl him through the gate. Late on a rain-affected day he returned to add the key wickets of Chris Read and Stephen Fleming to leave the champions in trouble again. They came into this game in the relegation zone with no wins and only nine batting bonus points from their first four matches, which might have explained a rare Old Trafford decision to bowl first when Lancashire's Mark Chilton won the toss after heavy overnight rain had prevented any play before lunch. Jason Gallian was smartly taken by Cork at third slip off Chapple in the third over, then Cork produced a beauty to have Will Smith caught behind. After Bicknell's dismissal David Hussey moved quickly to 19, only to cut Gary Keedy to backward point, but Read and Fleming added 73 for the fifth wicket either side of tea. Read was beaten four times in the first over after tea by Tom Smith, another rising star who bowled far more consistently than Newby with no reward. However, the wicketkeeper, an irresistible target for sledging after his recent disciplinary problems, cover-drove beautifully and reached a 72-ball half-century with consecutive boundaries off Newby, only to be bowled off an inside edge later in the over. Fleming, after a failure in his only previous championship innings this summer against Durham last week, crawled from 14 to 33 during Read's innings. It was a surprise when his watchful effort ended on 42 as he was suckered into driving Newby lazily to backward point. Paul Franks then flicked Chapple to Cork at square-leg to complete another good day for Lancashire, who have responded impressively to the loss of Sajid Mahmood and James Anderson this season. The weather forecast, however, suggests they may still struggle to keep pace with Sussex at the top of the table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
