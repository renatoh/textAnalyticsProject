Alan Johnson, the education secretary, told the Fabian Society last week just how optimistic he was that the new school diplomas would be a wonderful success. This, five days after telling school and college leaders that the diplomas \"could go horribly wrong\" and become the \"secondary moderns\" of the future. \"It was an innocent comment,\" he said of his gaffe. \"We are well on track to make sure they are delivered from 2008 ... We are now turning them into the radical, exciting qualifications we all hoped for.\" \u00b7 When former Labour leader Neil Kinnock turned up at the Institute of Education to be grilled by a Fabian Society audience, he must have known that the tireless campaigner for comprehensive education Malcolm Horne, general secretary of the Socialist Educational Association, would be there to tempt him to make trouble. Kinnock, as Labour's education spokesman, once said: \"Nobody who has observed a community that operates a selective 11-plus system can doubt that on the morning of the results there are ... floods of tears in many homes.\" So why, Horne asked innocently, did Kinnock think that after 10 years of a Labour government we still do not have comprehensive education in Britain? It was worth a try - Kinnock stepped out of line last year, to denounce Blair's trust schools. Sadly Kinnock was in obfuscating, not troublemaking, mood. He gave Horne five minutes of how we needed to \"make comprehensive an understood adjective\" and the need for smaller class sizes in secondary schools. \"You only came to ask that question,\" Notebook said to Horne afterwards. \"Yes, and I still didn't get an answer, did I?\" Horne barked back. \u00b7 It looks as if British universities really are doomed to see the Middle East conflict regularly fought on campus. We have reported before on the Engage (pro-Israeli) website analysing the terms in which candidates for the UCU general secretary condemned academic boycotts of Israel; on Clare College, Cambridge, working itself into a lather about a student newspaper that was thought to offend Muslims; and on a row between Jewish and Muslim students at Leeds University, each side accusing the other of trampling on their freedom of speech. Now we hear howls of outrage from the Engage website because a lecture at Leeds from German scholar Dr Matthias Kuentzel was cancelled after protests from Muslims. Surely a straightforward case of Muslims denying freedom of speech? Kuentzel's subject was to be \"Hitler's Legacy: Islamic Anti-semitism in the Middle East.\" Some Muslims might be forgiven for fearing they were about to be called Nazis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
