The move puts in serious doubt the president Evo Morales\u2019 ability to hang on to power after weeks of unrest over disputed election results. Local news reports on Saturday indicated that groups of police in the cities of Tarija, Oruro and Beni had joined their colleagues in Santa Cruz, Sucre and Cochabamba in rebelling against Morales\u2019 government. Flanked by military top brass, the chief commander of the Bolivian armed forces, Williams Kaliman, said on Saturday that the constitution prohibited them from entering into a confrontation with the people. On Friday the defence minister said no action would be taken against the mutinous police. Morales called for an \u201copen agenda debate to pacify Bolivia\u201d, inviting four political parties to talks in a televised address on Saturday. He reiterated claims that a coup attempt promoted by \u201cviolent groups\u201d and the opposition was trying to oust him from power and called on his supporters to \u201cmobilise to defend Bolivian democracy and the people\u2019s vote\u201d. However, his call for dialogue was promptly rejected by several political parties and his closest rival in last month\u2019s election, Carlos Mesa, who as a candidate would not have been invited to participate. Addressing Morales in a video message, Mesa suggested he should step down. \u201cYour decision is what will define your own fate and the fate of Bolivia. We have nothing to negotiate with you,\u201d he said. In La Paz on Saturday, crowds draped in the red, yellow and green Bolivian flags surrounded the empty Plaza Murillo, or main square, as police deserted barricades and withdrew to a police station just a block from the city\u2019s towering Casa Grande del Pueblo presidential palace and the parliament building. Soon after, police officers with their faces covered announced that they would be joining the mutiny, raising the Bolivian flag in the square and singing the national anthem. Supporters chanted: \u201cPolice, you are not alone.\u201d \u201cWe are with the people. The government can\u2019t use us to repress the people,\u201d one officer, who did not want to be identified, told the Observer. \u201cWe, the police, belong to the people. We do not belong to a political party or particular government.\u201d On Friday night crowds cheered dozens of police officers who marched down a main avenue and garrisoned themselves in the city\u2019s central police station. The mood was starkly different from previous nights of clashes as protesters surrounded officers singing: \u201cBrother, police, join the people.\u201d \u201cWe are here to protect the police,\u201d one protester, who did not want to give her name, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The mood was jubilant as tens of thousands of protesters filled the city\u2019s downtown throughout the night singing and setting off fireworks. \u201cWe want to support the police so they feel encouraged to join us,\u201d said 21-year-old student Alexander Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cThanks to this man [Morales], all Bolivia has united,\u201d said Mauricio Arambulu, 29, with a Bolivian flag tied around his shoulders. \u201cLa Paz is the city where tyrants fall.\u201d In rapid succession police units in the official capital, Sucre, and the most populous city, Santa Cruz, a bastion of the opposition, announced that they were joining the uprising launched by police officers in Cochabamba on Friday. Television images showed 18 uniformed police waving Bolivian flags from the rooftop of the special forces police station in Cochabamba to a cheering crowd. Luis Fernando Camacho, a self-styled opposition leader who the government accused of inciting a coup, tweeted that he \u201ccried with joy\u201d and thanked the police for \u201csiding with the people\u201d. The leader of the Pro Santa Cruz civic committee has vowed not to leave La Paz until he delivers a pre-written resignation letter and a Bible to Morales. At least three people have died, the latest a 20-year-old student on Wednesday, and more than 300 people have been injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and Morales\u2019 supporters since the disputed election on 20 October. In his toughest ever electoral race, Morales claimed victory with just enough votes to avoid a second-round runoff. But an unexplained 24-hour halt in releasing the vote results, which when resumed showed a shift in favour of the incumbent president, has fuelled accusations of fraud. The widespread police mutiny had substantially weakened the Morales government, said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropology professor specialising in Bolivia at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \u201cThe government is now obliged to manage the crisis without the police and attempt to offer a solution that addresses the large share of Bolivians who have no confidence in the election outcome,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cFresh elections under new electoral authorities can begin to satisfy the protesters.\u201d But they may not calm rising calls for Morales \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s president for nearly 14 years \u2013 to step down. The Organization of American States is conducting an audit of the election count and their findings are expected next week. Neither Camacho nor Mesa say they will accept the results because they were not properly consulted about the process. Amid a wave of demonstrations across the region, political analyst Ivan Arias said the Bolivian protests were centred on democratic rights. \u201cWhat the people are asking for is that their vote is respected,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
