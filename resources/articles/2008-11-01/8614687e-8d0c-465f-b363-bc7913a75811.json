If there is anyone here in Iceland who can drop bombshells, who can get the entire Icelandic nation up in arms, who can single-handedly and instantaneously create a major drama from a few choice phrases \u2013 it is him. Yesterday morning Oddsson \u2013 who was previously Iceland's longest-running prime minister and whose appointment to the central bank was entirely politically motivated (he is a lawyer, not an economist) \u2013 appeared at a breakfast meeting of the Icelandic chamber of commerce and made a thundering speech for about an hour. In that speech he proceeded to whitewash himself and the central bank of any wrongdoing in the lead-up to the economic crash here in Iceland. It was ludicrous to claim he had any part in it \u2013 he had warned everyone! He'd spoken repeatedly about the abyss towards which the banks were hurtling headlong, but nobody had listened! All the government leaders had done was go talk to the heads of the banks, who had told them that the central bank was paranoid! The central bank had had no power to stop any of it! But if an investigation revealed that he, in any way, had been remiss in his duties, then he'd be the first person to resign. David Oddsson is a bizarre figure in Icelandic society. Endowed with a forceful presence and sharp wit, he has towered above most politicians here for the past decades. Holding some kind of sway over a large part of the population, he has managed to get away with things that in other countries would constitute political suicide. Indeed, there was a time in the not-so-distant past when Oddsson might have been able to persuade a large part of the Icelandic population that he bore no responsibility for the economic meltdown. But no more. His words simply do not compute. For one thing, a meeting in London in February with foreign bankers and ratings firms is said to have alerted the central bank to the very serious indicators of what lay ahead in the Icelandic economy. According to Oddsson, the central bank governors were \"shocked and stunned\". Despite this, the central bank published a report in May entitled Financial Stability in which the fundamentals of the Icelandic economy were said to be \"solid\" and the economic outlook \"bright\". This speech marked the first time Oddsson has spoken publicly since an infamous interview on Iceland's Kastljos news programme in which he stated point-blank that Icelandic authorities had no intention of \"paying the debts of imprudent men\", including, as it transpired, deposits in foreign bank accounts. Many believe this interview prompted the UK to invoke anti-terrorist legislation in order to freeze the assets of Landsbanki. However, in yesterday's speech, Oddsson fired back at those who claimed his careless comments had triggered Gordon Brown's anti-terrorist move; he was in no way responsible. The fact was, he said, that \"not everything has come to light\", and added that he, himself, knew exactly why the anti-terrorist legislation had been set. However, he would reveal nothing more. Oddsson's speech has been harshly criticised here in Iceland \u2013 and has also been the subject of much speculation. Seeing as how he fired heavy ammunition at the Icelandic government, some are wondering if he has already been sacked and this is his parting shot. After all, throughout the economic fallout that Iceland has been subjected to in the last few weeks, his cronies in Iceland's ruling Independence party have done nothing but defend him. Yet dissent is already evident in the Icelandic government, since the Social Democrats, who make up half of the coalition, are furious and are calling for Oddsson's resignation. Indeed, just about everyone you talk to here is outraged that he has not been thrown out of office \u2013 if for no other reason than to try to establish some semblance of credibility in the central bank again. Everyone, that is, except the one man who has the power to dismiss him: Geir Haarde, the prime minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
