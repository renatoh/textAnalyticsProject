The sounds come from a flock of our smallest duck, the teal. The collective noun for teal is \u201cspring\u201d, and they do always seem to be spring-loaded and ready to fly. No matter how carefully my dog and I sneak past, they usually notice us, taking to the air in a flurry, before dropping down in the distance, well out of sight. To get closer to this delicate little duck, I headed south to the RSPB reserve at Greylake in Somerset. Once inside the roomy hide, I set up my scope and took a proper look. The drake teal\u2019s plumage is far more subtle and complex than it first appears. Black wiggles across his breast, known as \u201cvermiculations\u201d, from the Latin for worm; a creamy-yellow slash along his flanks; and the bluish-green eyepatch: teal being the only colour believed to be named after a British bird. He was resting on one leg, opening and shutting pale eyelids, as the rain splashed off his plumage like water off a waxed jacket. The prettiest of all our ducks? Wigeon, pintail and garganey might dispute that, but on a damp, overcast day, this little bird is hard to beat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
