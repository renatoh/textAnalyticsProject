Central contracts have played their part, as has a general raising of fitness levels for which the back-up staff deserve much credit. Seven players, Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Ashley Giles and Geraint Jones have played in all of the record-breaking sequence of eight matches. Injuries kept Graham Thorpe and Michael Vaughan out of one match, with Simon Jones injured for all but three, while Mark Butcher was also restricted to three because of freak accidents. Only James Anderson and, with the return of Butcher on this trip, Robert Key have been selected or left out for cricketing reasons. Having scrambled through the first Test with a performance described by Vaughan as \"shoddy\" in parts, England are unlikely to make any changes to the side for the second match which begins in Durban on Sunday. But, with Key having played with such vivacity in the summer, the traditional game of Butcher-watching may be beginning. Having been out of the side for much of the summer, Butcher got back into the team on his experience and general reliability at the expense of Key, who could console himself with the notion that his time would come. Butcher then, true to the script, produced 79 runs in the first innings, an effort for the most part chiselled out with almost painful dedication. But there it ended. A careless shot to get out when set, a dolly catch dropped and a nought in the second innings has once more placed the pressure on him. Butcher has been invaluable to the England cause over the past two years, arguably the most consistent player: runs in themselves do not always tell the full story, depending as they do so much on the circumstance of an innings. Yet in the light of the records of the other batsmen in the side, his certainly requires examination. It is, for example, 30 innings since he made a Test hundred, against South Africa at Trent Bridge 18 months ago. In that time, though, there have been 10 half-centuries, the effort in St George's Park last week the highest of them, an indication that his concentration wavers. In five of his last seven Test innings he has failed to reach double figures and the standards of this side now mean that such lapses are unacceptable. His performance in this match will come under increased scrutiny, with not just Key waiting his chance but Ian Bell and the newly qualified Kevin Pietersen, though neither is on tour here. Unchanged or not, Vaughan will be calling for greater diligence from his side. If, for the first Test, a number of players were not properly re-acclimatised to international cricket after a lengthy lay-off, then the match would have served as a proper build-up for the second. It is as if a new series starts now. They will encounter a different and stronger South African side, with the return of Herschelle Gibbs from injury (his build-up, involving a one-day game for Western Province Boland, was not a raging success as he made four); and the specialist spinner Nicky Boje, with whom they could have done in Port Elizabeth, comes into contention. There will be a match for the talented local batsman Hashim Amla, and also for the swing bowler Charl Langeveldt, who bowled superbly against England in their solitary warm-up match in Potchefstroom. It is possible that the batting could be further strengthened by handing over the wicketkeeping gloves to the multi-talented batsman AB de Villiers. Much, of course, will depend on a pitch that has given South Africa only one defeat - by Pakistan, by 29 runs, in 1998 - and six wins in the dozen matches played at Kingsmead since readmission to international cricket in 1992. Each of the last three matches has produced a victory for them, with West Indies trounced by an innings a year ago, Pakistan by 10 wickets the Christmas before that and, in the previous March, Australia by five wickets in a remarkable game that saw Gibbs make a century as they chased 340 to win, having conceded a first-innings deficit of 148. They are not an easy side to beat here. Preparation of the pitch will be crucial. On England's last visit it was moribund, with a slow hundred from Nasser Hussain and, after Andy Caddick, with seven for 46 had produced the finest bowling of his career to make South Africa follow on, a monumental innings of 275 from Gary Kirsten, equalling the highest for his country at that time. But, if the grass is left on, as it is reported Shaun Pollock has requested, there can be pace in it. Yesterday it had a thick covering of live grass, suggesting they may go down that road. If the home side are intent upon taking on England at their own pacy game, it could be high-octane stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
