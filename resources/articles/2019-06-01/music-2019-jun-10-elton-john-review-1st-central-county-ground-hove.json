Before retiring to spend more time with his young sons, his last ever show will be at London\u2019s O2 Arena on 16 December 2020, finishing a 19-date final leg in the UK and Ireland. This then is a little taster, as he pops into Cardiff, Dublin and, here, Sussex\u2019s county cricket ground. This is a man for whom a three-minute pop song won\u2019t do if it could be four, or six, or an 11-minute suite about the devastation of a breakup, as the proggy Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding is here tonight. He plays for nearly three hours, energy constantly high, finishing almost every song by getting off his piano stool and gesturing \u201cCome on!\u201d at the audience like a Watford striker who just delivered a 30-yard screamer. There are three outfits, variously featuring glittery cats, a Gucci brooch so large that it could crown a child monarch, and rose-tinted, heart-shaped spectacles. The bad cold that saw him cancel a Verona date a fortnight ago has clearly been banished. There are notes he can no longer reach, cold or not: that magical \u201cmagaziiine\u201d in Bennie and the Jets, or the chorus of Tiny Dancer, which is taken by percussionist John Mahon with Elton harmonising. The tradeoff is that his deeper register has taken on rich, worn colours that don\u2019t come across in the earlier recordings. Introducing Border Song, he says he was flattered whenever anyone covered his songs in those early days \u2013 \u201cIt could have been the Chipmunks or Ken Dodd, I didn\u2019t care\u201d \u2013 but this one was taken on by Aretha Franklin, and there\u2019s something of her to his delivery at times: a sensuality mixed with gospel fervour, that comes across most strongly in a blistering version of Levon. Beginning respectfully enough, it builds into quarter of an hour of wild piano and guitar soloing, bringing in bursts of Saturday Night\u2019s Alright for Fighting and the Beatles\u2019 Day Tripper. Elton frequently lifts a finger aloft as another hand pounds away, like a preacher giving you the alternative to the flames below. There\u2019s also a little of Jerry Lee Lewis in the emphatic slams of the piano lid that round off the barnstormers in his set. He calls his band the best he\u2019s ever worked with, and they are indeed a powerhouse outfit. John Jorgensen gets a string of kitsch guitars \u2013 twin-necked, blue glitter, one with the cover of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road painted on it \u2013 to unite rock\u2019n\u2019roll energy with beautiful details, such as the electric acoustic solo that closes out Rocket Man. Seventy-year-old drummer Nigel Olsson, who looks as if he could be the cricket club\u2019s treasurer, is spry and metronomic. Almost stealing the show though is percussionist Ray Cooper, who shakes his tambourine as if summoning sexy wood sprites in a fruity Cirque de Soleil show. His contributions on Indian Sunset are pure theatre, bringing its rambling tale of Native American bloodshed \u2013 they don\u2019t write them like that any more, and perhaps for a reason \u2013 to life with huge martial drums. There are big-screen visuals throughout, and while Rocket Man\u2019s look like a broadband advert, most are very good: drag-queen catfights for The Bitch is Back, neo-Soul Train dancing for Philadelphia Freedom. There\u2019s a gallery of inspirations for Border Song: Pussy Riot, Peter Tatchell, Princess Diana. I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call It the Blues is paired with Martin Parr seaside shots, ending on a union jack mug \u2013 a moment of patriotism that is repeated later, with Elton having unexpectedly modulated his stance on Brexit. In Verona he was castigating \u201cstupid, imperialist English idiots\u201d who voted us out; he now says \u201cwe voted to go out, so we must go out\u201d, and scotches talk of a second referendum: \u201cWe need to heal \u2026 to talk to each other\u201d. The notorious \u201cbitch\u201d of old has softened, with Don\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me movingly dedicated to \u201cthe Dwights\u201d: his half brothers and their families. Perhaps it\u2019s a result of the stocktaking that happened for his forthcoming memoir, and of course Rocketman. The film\u2019s star, Taron Egerton, is brought out to duet on Your Song, and the eerie sight of young and old Eltons shows just how far he has come: a man who took American forms \u2013 rock\u2019n\u2019roll, blues, gospel \u2013 and gave them an eccentric English theatre, resulting in something that is still unmatched. He has earned heart, brains and courage in spades, but it still feels too soon for the end of this yellow brick road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
