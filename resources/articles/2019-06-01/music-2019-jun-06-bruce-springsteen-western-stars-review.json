So dramatic, in fact, that in the interviews accompanying its release, Western Stars\u2019 author has felt impelled to reassure fans that he\u2019ll be back recording and touring with the E Street Band later this year. It\u2019s hard to miss the hint of \u201cnormal service will be resumed as soon as possible\u201d about that announcement, balm for Boss fans horrified by how far Western Stars takes their hero from either of his standard musical styles. There\u2019s not a hint of the E Street Band\u2019s booming Sturm und Drang, nor the stripped-back earthiness of his previous solo albums here: they\u2019re replaced by luscious orchestrations, heavy on the strings and French horn, cooing female backing vocals, guitars that shimmer and quiver with tremolo effects, mournful pedal steel. It\u2019s not founded in country music so much as a distinctive musical hybrid that flowed out of Hollywood\u2019s recording studios in the late 1960s and early 70s, which stirred Nashville with west coast folk-pop and ambitious, sophisticated arrangements: the grownup American pop of Glen Campbell\u2019s collaborations with Jimmy Webb or Harry Nilsson\u2019s covers of Everybody\u2019s Talkin\u2019 and I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City. This is clearly a departure, although there\u2019s a sense in which it\u2019s entirely in keeping with Springsteen\u2019s approach. His sound is almost invariably based in burnished nostalgia. The E Street Band and The Ghost of Tom Joad alike are rooted in the music that flourished in the US when Springsteen was about 12 years old: the former an amplification of pre-Beatles American pop \u2013 both the echoing drama of Phil Spector and the blare and honk of Dion and the Belmonts \u2013 the latter a take on the early 60s folk revival, with particular reference to Bob Dylan in young, keeper-of-the-Woody-Guthrie-flame mode. Western Stars simply shifts its backwards gaze on a few years, to the stuff that would have dominated mainstream taste during Springsteen\u2019s late teens, at a time when it might have been hipper to dig Jefferson Airplane \u2013 but what budding young artist could fail to have his head turned by such consummate examples of the songwriter\u2019s craft? Certainly, there\u2019s a real and rather affecting love evident in the way Springsteen channels the sound on Western Stars. There are moments of transcendent loveliness \u2013 not least the shivering instrumental coda of Drive Fast \u2013 but he\u2019s also unafraid of its occasional tendency towards schmaltz. Quite the opposite. Listening to There Goes My Miracle or Sundown, on which he slathers on the high-camp strings and transforms his voice into a croon, denuded of the usual Springsteen grit, you get the feeling he\u2019s having a whale of a time: an artist always held up as the apotheosis of honest, blue-collar heartland rock revelling in artifice, in much the same way as he audibly delighted in telling audiences at his Broadway residency that the character of Bruce Springsteen was a Ziggy Stardust-ish construct who had never done anything. It helps that the songs are strong enough to withstand the treatment, seldom slipping into pastiche. The only real misfire is Sleepy Joe\u2019s Caf\u00e9, which feels a little round-edged for its own good, not aided by an ingratiatingly perky accordion: the E Street Band could have turned it into something more driving and potent. \u201cIt\u2019s the same sad story, going round and round,\u201d Springsteen sings on The Wayfarer and listening to the rest of the album\u2019s lyrics, you take his point. If the sound of Western Stars sets it apart from Springsteen\u2019s earlier solo albums, the words pull it closer. Like Nebraska or The Ghost of Tom Joad, it offers a selection of bleak narratives and lingering pen-portraits, and, like Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad, it seems a product of its era. The former album\u2019s cast of conflicted cops and desperate criminals undercut the gung-ho triumphalism of Reagan\u2019s America, while Tom Joad\u2019s illegal immigrants and drug runners did the same for an era of record highs on the Dow Jones index. Western Stars, meanwhile, is populated by characters past their best \u2013 the title track\u2019s fading actor, reduced to hawking Viagra on TV and retelling his stories for anyone who\u2019ll buy him a drink; Drive Fast\u2019s injured stuntman recalling his youthful recklessness, the failed songwriter of Somewhere North of Nashville and the guy glumly surveying the boarded-up site of an old tryst on Moonlight Motel \u2013 all of them ruminating on how things have changed, not just for the worse, but in ways none of them anticipated. It adds up to an album that manages to be both unexpected and of a piece with its author\u2019s back catalogue. Normal service may well be resumed in due course, but Western Stars is powerful enough to make you wish Bruce Springsteen would take more stylistic detours in the future. \u2022 Western Stars is released on 14 June. This week Alexis listened to Bill Callahan: What Comes After Certainty The closer and standout from Callahan\u2019s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, a song that feels like an intimate, slightly rambling late-night conversation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
