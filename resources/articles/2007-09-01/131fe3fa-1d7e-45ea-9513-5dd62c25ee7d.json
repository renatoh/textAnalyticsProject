Skrela, an outstanding player in France's Six Nations success this year, has a slight tear on his left achilles tendon and requires strict rest and treatment. The 28-year-old main goalkicker will miss France's second Group D match against Namibia next Sunday in Toulouse and the showdown with Ireland at Stade de France five days later. France must win these games as well as their final match against Georgia to stand any chance of topping the group and avoiding a likely quarter-final against New Zealand. Skrela kicked four penalties against the Pumas but was generally out of sorts, and the coach, Bernard Laporte, now has to rethink his half-back pairing. He could either play Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak alongside the current scrum-half Pierre Mignoni, or drop Mignoni in favour of pairing Michalak with Jean-Baptiste Elissalde. Lapasset's comments, in the French sports daily L'Equipe, will not have helped improve morale. \"I'm very disappointed, I'm hurt. I have a feeling of betrayal, maybe the word is too strong, a feeling of desertion,\" he said. \"Our team disappointed 14 million who watched on television. They failed to meet their expectations.\" He shared the sadness of the players and staff but blamed them for \"failing by lack of analysis to counter the Pumas' game[plan], which had nothing to surprise.\" In a rare criticism of Laporte, he hinted that he had disagreed with team selection. \"I had my words to say but at the end the decision went to the coach.\" Argentina, meantime, will field the key players from their victory over France for tomorrow's second outing against Georgia including the half-backs Agustin Pichot and Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, the inside centre Felipe Contepomi and the try-scoring full-back Ignacio Corleto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
