Here\u2019s the best of both days \u2013 and a few things that went down like Davy Jones\u2019 locker. Best Miami pool party vibes: Viceroy Upon arrival, Treasure Island has some fairly ominous weather overhead, but Viceroy isn\u2019t having any of it. Neon visuals, hotpants and flamboyant button-downs conjure up a Miami spring break ambience. Proving he know how SF does weekends, Miami-Vice-roy pops a bottle of bub, spins up Nelly\u2019s Ride With Me with a trop-house twist and kickstarts the party. At that moment the sun sears off all the cloud coverage and festival heats up. Freshest face: Shamir Shamir looks alarmingly nervous gliding across the Tunnel Stage to take hold of his mic. Turning 21 next month, he is the youngest artist on the bill. But Shamir\u2019s seemingly timid on-stage demeanour rapidly evaporates. Shamir has stated that he does not identify as male or female, and his music has fun with concepts of androgyny, contrasting his own falsetto with his female backup singers who sing through vocal filters that make their voices deeper. After moving from In For the Kill to his autobiographical lament Hot Mess, Shamir satiates hungry fans with his biggest and most joyous songs: On the Regular and Call it Off. Best sunset set: Cashmere Cat Cashmere Cat goes to work on the Tunnel Stage as the sun begins to lean toward the Golden Gate bridge. Those longing for Insta-fame turn their hovering phones on the cityscape. The Tunnel Stage lighting rig perfectly frames Ghirardelli Square to provide the audience with an out-of-body perspective of San Francisco. And just as swift as a well-timed drop, Cashmere Cat hits the bass so deep, the speakers appeared to blow fans off the stage-front gates. Audience members lower their phones with a gasp at the bassy vibrations in their core, created by Cashy Cat\u2019s buttery electro-hip pop. With remixes of Drake\u2019s Hotline Bling and fan-favorites like Mirror Maru, the Norwegian producer ushers in the sunset dance party of the weekend. Strongest totem game: The \u2018Legion of Bill\u2019 squad A mob of Bill Murray fans swarm the festival marketing the beloved comic\u2019s latest movie Rock the Kasbah. Mini-totems don versions of Murray, from young Stripes Murray to Team Zissou Murray, recruiting other fans as they go. Best sunset chill spot: the argh!-T cars Many thought the ferris wheel was the perfect way to see the sunset over TI. But unless you timed it perfectly, you would have spent the final moments of sun waiting in the festival\u2019s longest line. Which is why we steered clear, instead posting up on the deck of Capt\u2019n Jay\u2019s pirate zeppelin. The argh!-T car was previously spotted casting anchor at Burning Man, where a team of TIMF scouts recruit much of the art programming seen throughout the festival. The Tony award goes to \u2026 Father John Misty Sunday\u2019s most anticipated afternoon performer arrives exuberantly with a comic flair for dramatics. Father John Misty takes the stage and boy does that beard have some shimmy. He takes his mic stand for a dance partner before checking in with the spectators. \u201cI\u2019m going to make somewhat of a controversial hair choice,\u201d he announces. Milking the dramatic suspense, Father John Misty bites an elastic off his cuff and secures the wad of locks he has pulled into his fist, but not without consulting his audience. \u201cShould I go full bun, or half bun?\u201d He proceeds to peacock around his stage, hamming it up for the four o\u2019clock crowd. \u201cOh, this is great! I can see why people do this.\u201d Most crucial day two fuel duo: paella and acai bowl As Sunday rolls around, light snacks and all-day boozing just isn\u2019t going to cut it. Sustenance is key. Perhaps it was a coincidence that Gerard\u2019s famous paella and the acai stand are situated right next to each other, but I can\u2019t think of a better way to get nourished than to order one of each. The combination of these two items provides enough strength to tackle another day of the #FestLife. An all-encompassing sigh of relief: overall logistical flow Treasure Island music festival 2015 runs like a dream. Lockers equipped with cellphone chargers are installed by the entrance. Non-stop shuttle transport keep the flow of bodies consistently moving. The bathroom portapot-ropolis never sees a line, despite there only being one designated relief space for general admission. Additionally, Treasure Island\u2019s tight layout makes finding familiar faces easy. There\u2019s no more than a two-minute wait for a beer or cocktail either. In fact, the only extended wait, once inside the grounds, is for the ferris wheel. Overall, running around Treasure Island for a weekend of fest-ing feels like wearing your most comfortable outfit when you remember to dress appropriately for the weather. Most Halloween-appropriate set: Chvrches Sapphire stage lights whirl into the audience to signal for attention. Singer Lauren Mayberry floats across the stage in a black tulle tutu. By this time, the wind has shuttled the distant fog to the island, providing an eerie chill that complements the darker side of Chvrches\u2019s sweet electro-pop. The Scottish three-piece charge up their awaiting admirers with Never Ending Circles, the first track off the new album Every Open Eye, leaning on newer material in the first half, then flipping the script to play older favorites on the backend. Trippiest visuals: Panda Bear The Animal Collective vocalist and multi-instrumentalist brings the most intensely eye-watering psychedelic visuals. As Panda Bear takes his turn with the soul-gripping bass levels of the Tunnel Stage, a kaleidoscope of writhing body parts twists in sync on screen behind him. Before hypnosis takes a stronghold, the dancing pinwheel dissipates, revealing two figures enthralled in a sensual dance just as mesmerising as the previous displays. At one point, three women appear and vomit gold chunks. Then there\u2019s a Phillips logo. Cool. Stalest frat jams: Deadmau5 When Deadmau5 launches into the first notes of Avaritia, the initial excitement gives the audience a tickle. But this is quickly drowned out by the belligerent barrage of bros squealing the sweeping synth line. Looking around, you see armies of young men in salmon short-shorts and docksiders. The boat-shoe-EDM and impressive stage set-up are digested like junk food, leaving an empty feeling. Saturday (Too Turnt) v Sunday (Too Chill) Saturday\u2019s lineup is non-stop. Festivalgoers who invested time and money in both event days face an uphill battle to keep energy levels high. Unfortunately, the Sunday lineup does not help this cause. Although strong talent such as the War on Drugs and the National fit Sunday\u2019s bill, these are also some pretty sleepy sets for those already running on empty \u2013 even if the National do bring out Mayberry from Chvrches for I Need My Girl. The wind Perhaps an imagination easily encouraged by apocalyptic hypotheticals has run wild here, but there is no clear emergency plan in the event of sudden and severe climate shifts. Luckily, the only manifestation of this possibility is a cold, relentless gust that seemed to challenge many vocalists, but most were able to warm up to their familiar quality by their second or third song."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
