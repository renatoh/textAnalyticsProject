For the first time, ITV viewers will be supplied with the superior pictures created by Bernie Ecclestone's pay-per-view digital organisation. But it remains to be seen whether or not the transmission, no matter how technically advanced in execution, will be good enough to halt the decline in interest among viewers. It is a question that has increased significance here as F1 struggles to gain recognition among an audience both unfamiliar with grand prix racing and unimpressed by processional racing. Pressure of business may have kept Bernie Ecclestone away from Indianapolis this weekend, but the de facto boss of F1 has, for the first time, made public his concern about the sport's future. 'We need to shape-up,' said Ecclestone in an interview to be shown on ITV before today's race. 'We haven't got a very good act at the moment. It's no one's fault. Michael [Schumacher] will win again in 2003 - but not that easily. The teams will be more competitive.' On the basis of this year's performance - Schumacher is heading for his eleventh victory in 16 races today - rival teams will need to be more than merely competitive. Ecclestone admits that the problem goes beyond the shortfall in performance demonstrated by Williams, McLaren and the rest. Commenting on the recent Belgian Grand Prix where drivers tackled the previously daunting Eau Rouge corner almost with one hand on the wheel, Ecclestone agreed that the effect of advanced technology had overtaken the input of the driver. 'The in-car camera made Michael [the winner at Spa] look like he was driving to the shops.' ECCLESTONE HAS CALLED for wide-ranging changes - a one-tyre formula that would put drivers on an equal footing, a reduction in the use of electronics and a cut back in aerodynamics - but achieving the necessary unanimity among the teams will be extremely difficult, particularly when millions have been spent reaching the current pitch of sophistication. Ecclestone's concern reflects a contradiction as various countries jostle for the right to hold a grand prix. A deal has been reached with Bahrain for 2004, while China, Russia and Turkey continue to formulate their plans. But even if these projects reach fruition, Ecclestone is aware that F1 needs to race in the USA if the 'world championship' appellation is to have full meaning. F1's first visit to Indianapolis in 2000 produced a modern-day attendance record of more than 200,000. Since then, the numbers have fallen, but, even so, the estimated 150,000 paying to get in today will represent the largest crowd figure for any grand prix this season. The problem for F1 and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is that the audience will appear to be thinly spread along the massive grandstand that lines the main straight in one of the world's largest sporting facilities. The 2.6-mile F1 circuit uses only part of the famous oval track. The original dirt surface constructed in 1909 was replaced with bricks; hence the name 'Brickyard' that is still used today even though asphalt was laid in 1937, but not before part of a golf course was introduced within the 2.5-mile oval. The F1 track runs in the reverse direction along the main straight before leaving the wide-open spaces for a tight, infield section more in keeping with some of the tedious grand prix tracks elsewhere. Plans to expand to the back straight of the speedway have been put on hold, leaving the drivers and technicians with the tricky challenge of setting up their cars for the flat-out section while dealing with the handling requirements of the infield. Indianapolis, thanks to its lavish facilities and reasonably challenging track, is popular within the F1 fraternity. The question is whether or not grand prix racing will find a place in the hearts of American race fans. With no home-grown drivers in the field, Juan Pablo Montoya remains the favourite thanks to the Colombian having won the classic Indianapolis 500 in 2000. For a country that thrives on records, the fact that Montoya was the first rookie to win the Indy 500 since Britain's Graham Hill in 1966 actually means more than the extraordinary roster of achievement currently being amassed by Michael Schumacher. And therein lies F1's problem in the USA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
