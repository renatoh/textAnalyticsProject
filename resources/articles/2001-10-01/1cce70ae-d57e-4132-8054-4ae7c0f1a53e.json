He answers his own question: 'Arguably, we settled for writing, a sissy's game, because we couldn't \"float like a butterfly and sting like a bee\", pitch a curveball, score a touchdown.' Not quite true in Richler's case, for he admits to having been a teenage hustler and 'poolroom bum' with the likes of Oil Can Harry and Suitcase Sam in the seedy halls of working-class Montreal. 'Snooker,' he explains, 'was a hell of a lot more fun than Talmud classes.' In later life, it served another purpose in the writer's life: 'Whenever I'm enduring a bummer of a morning at my typewriter in my upstairs studio, I slip down to bang the balls around on the green baize'. As with John Updike on golf and Norman Mailer on boxing, so Richler on snooker: 'Sport weighs heavily on the American literary man's psyche.' He quotes Updike: 'Like a religion, a game seeks to codify and lighten life. Played earnestly enough, a game can gather to itself awesome dimensions of subtlety and transcendental significance.' For Richler, sport offered an incentive to writing: 'If Higgins could make a maximum, or David Cone pitch a perfect baseball game, then just maybe, against all odds, a flawless novel was possible.' He traces the history of snooker, recalls the game's giants and follows the British professional circuit for a season. If it seems odd for a serious novelist to be so emotionally engaged with a game - and he admits 'there are times when my obsession with time-wasting sports irritates the hell out of me' - he can cite others who have described contests on the green baize: Pushkin, Tolstoy, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot and Conrad. In all honesty, this book doesn't tell snooker fans much they didn't know before, though he throws out a few stray facts that are worth holding on to: did you know, for example, that Billy Graham came to religion on a golf course or that the oft-quoted phrase about a 'misspent youth' comes from the nineteenth-century British philosopher Herbert Spencer? The book's strength lies in Richler's rich exuberance. At one point, he uses the phrase 'before I began to suffer from gravitas'. The truth is that, thankfully, Mordecai never did suffer from that. Now that he has died, at the age of 70, I find something poignant in the picture he paints of himself in the snooker room in his dacha on the shores of Lake Memphremagog with a 10 pack of Davidoff's demitasse cigarillos, a plentiful supply of cashews and bottles of Macallan and Highland Spring, praying for his beloved Stephen Hendry to make a comeback and win his eighth world title. I can think of few more congenial places to be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
