Yeats won by four lengths last year and yesterday his trainer, Aidan O'Brien, issued an ominous warning to his 13 rivals. \"He is a bigger, stronger, heavier horse than he has ever been before,\" said O'Brien. \"For some reason, he has gone very classy and pacey in his work, more than he ever showed before. Maybe that is maturity.\" Yeats (3.45) has won his warm-up races in Ireland by a total of 11 lengths and is clearly at the top of his game. Few horses truly stay the two and a half miles of the Gold Cup but Yeats, a former winner of the Coronation Cup at Epsom, has a high-class blend of speed and stamina. Last year he followed up his victory here, when he had Sergeant Cecil over eight lengths back in fifth spot, with a brilliant display in the Goodwood Cup. Giving weight all round, he pulled five lengths clear of Geordieland, breaking the two-mile track record in the process. This time, Sergeant Cecil was 10 lengths adrift in fourth place. Sergeant Cecil may well improve on his running here last year, as he has upped his game in the meantime, winning the Prix du Cadran at Longchamp and last month giving 5lb and a narrow beating to Geordieland in the Yorkshire Cup. The one to chase home Yeats, however, might be the French mare, Montare. So far this season, including when third behind Lord Du Sud last time, Montare has not been equipped with cheekpieces. They are back on for the Gold Cup and clearly sharpened her up at Longchamp last autumn when she beat Sergeant Cecil and Lord Du Sud in the Prix Royal-Oak. Godolphin have an excellent Gold Cup record, winning with Papineau, Kayf Tara (twice) and Classic Clich\u00e9 in the last 11 years. Cherry Mix will need to call on untapped reserves of stamina to improve that tally but, as a triple Group One winner, he cannot be discounted. 2.30 Peter Chapple-Hyam's decision to bypass the six-furlongs Coventry Stakes to wait for this with Winker Watson can pay dividends. The Piccolo colt showed fine speed to win over Newbury's extended five furlongs and reports from Newmarket suggest Winker Watson has gone from strength to strength since then. Aidan O'Brien's unbeaten Warsaw is clearly speedy but the proximity of Mick Channon's Silver Guest (third) at the Curragh suggests he is not out of the top drawer. 3.05 Having had nearly three weeks to get over her exertions, All My Loving is the logical choice to step up on her fine third behind Light Shift in the Oaks. For a filly having just her third start, she did well to show ahead with three furlongs to run. Though beaten four lengths by the principals, All My Loving was in turn five lengths and more clear of the remainder. 4.20 Colorado Rapid. This three-year-old is highly regarded by trainer Mark Johnston, who was tempted to run him in Tuesday's St James's Palace Stakes but decided to capitalise on what could prove a lenient handicap mark. Held up on his last run at Pontefract, Colorado Rapid showed a fine turn of foot to win going away. Very much on the upgrade, he will have no problem getting cover in this field. 4.55 Once Mark Johnston's horses improve, there is no telling how much they will find and Zaham is feared on this step up from handicap company. But this could be consolation for Kid Mambo, who led the Derby field a merry dance for a long way and did not capitulate when headed, finishing a creditable seventh. This two-furlongs shorter trip looks ideal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
