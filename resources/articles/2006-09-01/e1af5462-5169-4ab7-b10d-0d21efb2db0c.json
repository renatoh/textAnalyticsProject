All that can be said for sure is that Dave Jones's team were a sight too good for Southend yesterday and that there is a sense of momentum about the club which suggests that, of the 14 or so teams who might win promotion from what is increasingly looking like a very average division, they appear to have a better chance than most. \"We've got a belief, and we're keeping players fit, which is important for us because of the size of the squad. What you saw on the pitch and on the bench today is all we have,\" said Jones, after watching City first draw Southend's sting by matching their effort and desire, and then ruthlessly demonstrate their greater quality in just about every position. No, he said, he was not surprised to be sitting three points clear at the top of the league. \"You saw what we were about today. With two or three minutes remaining we were still in their faces and our attitude and work-rate were fantastic. \"I have a squad of players that believes things are happening, I have supporters who believe things are going to happen, so why should I take all that away from them? We're not overconfident, we know there's a long way to go and some big, big games coming up, but today was an opportunity for us.\" From the moment in the 10th minute when Darren Purse slid in to bundle Stephen McPhail's quickly taken free-kick past Southend's goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan from a couple of yards, there was no doubting they were going to take that opportunity. True, Billy Paynter had looped a header on to the top of the bar a minute earlier, but Neil Alexander had it covered and Cardiff were already beginning to bully their determined, but limited, opponents. Their superiority was most evident in midfield where McPhail and Riccardo Scimeca knew too much for a team who, it is worth remembering, was playing League Two football two years ago. Up front, Cardiff's partnership of Steven Thompson and Michael Chopra was simply too good for the Southend central defenders, Peter Clarke and Adam Barrett, and with Joe Ledley and Paul Parry, supported by the full-backs Kerrea Gilbert and Kevin McNaughton, providing plenty of width, there were spells when it looked as though Southend might be overrun. The Shrimpers hung on in there, though, at least until shortly before half-time when Scimeca's shot brought a good scrambling save from Flahavan. The corner was swung in and any number of Cardiff players might have scored in the scramble that resulted before Scimeca himself fired home after Chopra's back-heel left the Southend defenders flat-footed. With the game effectively over, the second half became something of a Cardiff exhibition. Passing the ball with patience, always moving into space and breaking quickly when the opportunity presented itself, Jones's side had the opposition chasing shadows. On a hot afternoon Southend began to run out of steam. The visitors created and missed a number of chances; Chopra, Gilbert, Scimeca and Thompson all went close, before Gilbert's ball found Chopra in acres of space down the right with 20 minutes remaining and his cross may have been turned over his own line by Simon Francis as the full-back stretched to clear even before Ledley applied the final touch. Southend's only threat had come from long-range pot-shots, usually fired in by the frustrated Freddy Eastwood, though they almost made an immediate reply when Cardiff's hitherto immaculate defence lost concentration for a moment and gave Mark Gower the chance to shoot no more than a foot wide. In injury- time Gary Hooper forced Alexander to block his close-range shot but that was the sum of the home team's efforts on an afternoon in which they were taught a valuable lesson. \"The step up in class showed today,\" the Southend manager Steve Tilson acknowledged. \"After they got a second goal they kept the ball really well and the truth is we never really looked like scoring. They looked a good side.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
