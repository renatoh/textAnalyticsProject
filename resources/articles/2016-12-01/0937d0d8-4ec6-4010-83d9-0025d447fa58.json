The bare details of the 24-year-old asylum seeker\u2019s death in 2014 are well known \u2013 the worsening infection, the stubborn fever that could not be shifted by any treatment, the requests to move him to hospital delayed and resisted, the heart attacks, the brain death, and finally, the end. But laid before Queensland state coroner Terry Ryan over two weeks there has been new evidence with brutal details, including: \u2022 Doctors\u2019 instructions to provide Kehazaei with intravenous paracetamol were ignored two nights in a row by night staff, leaving him in increasing pain, vomiting and growing increasingly confused as infection took over his body and left him without enough oxygen going to his brain. \u2022 As he grew increasingly sick and sepsis took hold, Kehazaei was heard, even from outside the medical centre, screaming unremittingly, how he was unable to recognise friends and staff whom he knew well. \u2022 Severely hypoxic, scared and unable to understand what was happening to him, Kehazaei pulled the intravenous lines from his arm, became combative with staff and refused to wear a mask. \u2022 Kehazaei was left lying unsheltered from the tropical sun at the airfield \u2013 febrile and septic, but unsedated \u2013 while he waited for the air ambulance to land and finally fly him off the island to a hospital. \u201cHe was the most awful colour I\u2019ve ever seen in a human being,\u201d Dr Marten Muis said of Kehazaei\u2019s final conscious moments on the island. \u201cHe was a sort of grey-purply colour. \u201cHis breathing was over 30, he seemed confused. If you went anywhere near him to put a mask on him, he would put his arms up or strike out.\u201d Over a fortnight of hearings at the coronial inquest into Kehazaei\u2019s death, Manus Island medical staff appeared in steady succession before the coroner to explain in detail how the 24-year-old\u2019s health deteriorated precipitously while he was being treated in detention, as their pleas to have him moved to a hospital were either ignored or refused by Australian immigration department officials. One doctor revealed how he was reduced to rummaging through a cupboard, \u201cthe very small pharmacy that we had\u201d, to see if there were any more antibiotics they might give Kehazaei, because nothing over 36 hours had helped him, and he was growing sicker by the hour. Another was reportedly furious at being told by bureaucrats in Australia that Kehazaei couldn\u2019t be moved \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re on your own and you\u2019re going to have to keep this man overnight\u201d \u2013 and that her instructions to give him pain relief medicine overnight were ignored two nights in a row. But beyond Kehazaei\u2019s specific, tragic circumstance, and perhaps ultimately of greater import, are the statements made before the coroner about the broader systemic failures of a regime that is maintained as a closely guarded secret. A succession of health professionals gave evidence that the clinical opinions of health professionals are routinely overruled in offshore detention by non-medically trained department bureaucrats. Doctors on Manus Island also told the coroner they were constantly frustrated at their working conditions within the rudimentary clinic, by poorly trained staff who ignored clinical directions, by a lack of medication and diagnostic equipment, by unhygienic conditions, and most crucially, by a system of control from Canberra that resisted all efforts to move critically ill patients to higher levels of care in hospital. \u201cThere was a pressure regarding finances and budgets of doing air ambulance evacuations ... and for people to travel to Australia we knew that there was a political pressure in the department,\u201d one doctor said. A cohort of immigration and border protection staff called to appear before the coroner attempted to resolutely \u2013 truculently at times \u2013 defend the policies. Each ran, without much variation or sophistication, a defence that they were following orders. \u201cMy role was not to question or to seek further information,\u201d Caroline Gow, the department\u2019s former assistant director of detention health services, said when asked why she hadn\u2019t sought more information on Kehazaei\u2019s worsening health. \u201cI can\u2019t undermine my bosses and go above them. It\u2019s their responsibility to give the approval.\u201d Their answers revealed the dangers of a hollowed out department, where frank and fearless advice, and any commitment to the genuine service of the public interest are at risk from a slavish prosecution of a policy that is known to be dangerous. None of the senior immigration officials appearing before the coroner, rising to the level of first assistant secretary, seemed to acknowledge there was any moral dimension to their responsibilities or to those of their organisation. None conceded to understanding there was a higher responsibility to keep Kehazaei alive. Before the coroner, examples abounded of lapse, followed by justification. An \u201curgent medical transfer request\u201d at 1.15pm that warned Kehazaei was at risk of \u201csepis, life-threatening widespread systemic infection\u201d, nonetheless \u201cdid not paint a picture of urgency\u201d to the director of detention health services, Amanda Little, who declined to send the case to her superiors for approval. When she did ultimately \u201cescalate\u201d the case to assistant secretary Paul Windsor \u2013 at 7:24pm - he had gone home for the day and did not read his emails for another 13 hours. \u201cThe time it took me to put something forward was not something that would significantly delay the process,\u201d he told the coroner in defence of the delay. \u201cYou could argue that the process could be streamlined so it didn\u2019t have to pass through the hands of four officers. I would argue that the process worked well on many occasions.\u201d The evidence before this coronial inquest has also shown, beyond any reasonable argument, who runs offshore detention. Australia controls offshore detention, and micromanages the decisions that take place within the camps on Nauru and Manus Island. No asylum seeker or refugee can be moved from an offshore camp without the express permission of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in Canberra. The department retains absolute and forensic control of everything that happens in those places. Approval for an asylum seeker in detention to go to hospital needed to pass across the desk of five department bureaucrats \u201cto ensure that the officer commanding Operation Sovereign Borders, and subsequently the minister was aware of transferee movements\u201d, Little told the coroner. Papua New Guinea and Nauru are, in this respect if not entirely, client states of Australia. The argument that they are independent sovereign nations running offshore detention of their own accord is a fiction long been rejected by almost-universal legal opinion. This coronial inquiry has only reinforced Australia\u2019s realist domination of its two neighbours. Ryan will sit again in February for two weeks to further examine Kehazaei\u2019s treatment, decline and death. But the evidence already before him shows a systemically impaired system that was known to provide insufficient and ineffective healthcare to those it was supposed to look after for. Healthcare in offshore detention is \u201cbroadly comparable\u201d with that available in the Australian community, Mark Parrish, the regional director of International Health and Medical Services, told the coroner. That phrasing \u2013 \u201cbroadly comparable\u201d \u2013 has been widely adopted, by ministers and prime ministers, and by the department, and was repeated by officials brought before the coroner as evidence in and of itself that all is fine offshore. But saying something over and over again does not make it true: this coronial inquest, long before it has finished, has exposed the flaws in that statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
