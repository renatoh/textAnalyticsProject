If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Top stories It\u2019s still all about the Tory leadership contest. Frontrunner Boris Johnson launched his campaign, shrugging off his long history of gaffes and blunders and painting himself as a one-nation candidate who could \u201cunite our country and our society\u201d. As widely predicted, the former foreign secretary promptly won the first round, garnering the support of 114 Conservative MPs against 43 for Jeremy Hunt, 37 for Michael Gove, 27 for Dominic Raab, 23 for Sajid Javid and 19 for Rory Stewart. His promise, along with others, to take the UK out of the EU \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d by 31 October came in for much stick. Philip Hammond said it would be impossible, and Rory Stewart threatened to set up an \u201calternative parliament\u201d to prevent it. Ken Clarke said any government backing no deal would be brought down, while the former Tory prime minister John Major reckoned anyone who believed Britain could possibly leave by Halloween was \u201choping for a miracle\u201d. Hunt also said 31 October should not be a \u201chard stop\u201d, warning that Johnson was posing a \u201cstark choice\u201d between no deal and a general election. But Raab said the Tories \u201cwould be toast\u201d if the 31 October deadline was not respected. But candidates hoping to force a \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d Brexit in October were boosted when MPs defeated a Labour-led attempt to prevent a no-deal exit, as opponents of a no-deal departure were warned they are fast running out of options. All the remaining leadership candidates \u2013 bar Johnson, who didn\u2019t fancy a format that allowed the candidates to address each other \u2013 stuck to their respective Brexit lines in a Channel 4 debate and lobby hustings, and health secretary Matt Hancock (who\u2019d pulled out after the first round of voting) came out for Johnson. In Brussels (remember Brussels?), the EU27 stressed for the umpteenth time that the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened, adding that while the bloc would not be able to sue the UK if \u2013 as Johnson has threatened \u2013 it withholds its \u00a339bn divorce bill, Britain\u2019s economy, security and universities would suffer if it did. And over at the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn is facing a Brexit showdown with his shadow cabinet \u2013 including deputy leader Tom Watson \u2013 amid growing signs of grassroots revolt if he fails to give full backing to a second referendum in which Labour would campaign to remain. What next We can expect few concrete developments for several months. The new Tory leader \u2013 and UK prime minister \u2013 should be confirmed by 22 July, at which point parliament will presumably go into recess and the EU27 on holiday. A couple of weeks after MPs return to Westminster in September, conference season starts. The EU will be preoccupied with winning MEPs\u2019 backing for the new commission by 1 November. A 17-18 October summit, just a fortnight before the Brexit deadline, should help focus minds. While most candidates seem to believe it\u2019ll be a doddle to renegotiate the withdrawal treaty and fix the backstop, that\u2019s not actually going to happen \u2013 and certainly not before 31 October. So it\u2019s either a further extension (which Emmanuel Macron, for one, is not keen on) or no deal (which MPs could probably still block). Brexit: the gift that keeps on giving. Best of the rest UK growth tipped to slow as firms run down stockpiles Divided, pessimistic, angry: survey reveals bleak mood of pre-Brexit UK UK businesses urged to step up preparations for no-deal Brexit Varadkar: removing Irish backstop would be as bad as no-deal Brexit No deal is \u201cextremely serious\u201d for Northern Ireland, warns Tory MP Brexit \u201cshambles\u201d has ruined UK\u2019s reputation, says senior diplomat Food Standards Agency struggling to prepare for Brexit, say auditors Third of Britons say they avoid news out of Brexit frustration UK jobs growth slows amid Brexit uncertainty Top comment In the Guardian, Fintan O\u2019Toole says politicians\u2019 talk of Britain\u2019s \u201cnational humiliation\u201d is dangerous: Yes, of course, the Brexit debacle has reduced Britain\u2019s prestige around the world. And the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May is indeed a miserable thing when compared with the glorious visions that preceded it. But Britain has not been humiliated by the EU \u2013 the deal was shaped by May\u2019s (and Arlene Foster\u2019s) red lines. Britain did not get what the Brexiters fantasised about, but it did get what it actually asked for. That\u2019s not humiliation. But at its heart, Brexit depends on the idea that Britain cannot be an ordinary European country and, therefore, that equality within the EU is inherently humiliating. Britain is humiliated by the EU because it expects to be superior. But it [humiliation] is a dangerous word. It may have no substance, but it has the power to harm. It brings down with it an acid rain of corrosive emotions: the need, at all costs, not to lose face, the indulgence of self-pity, the demented idea that national pride can be restored only by the endurance of great pain. It needs to be banished from the Brexit discourse. Acknowledging reality is not humiliating. Accepting that you have made a mistake is not humiliating. And Polly Toynbee says you should trust Boris Johnson as far as you could throw him: His snake oil of choice is optimism, so miserably lacking in politics now, radiating out of him like sunshine. [But this is] a man without qualities, devoid of public spirit or regard for anyone but himself, consumed by lifelong ambition, needy for acclaim and irritable when it\u2019s denied, willing to swing dangerously in any direction to be loved, a man to shame the country as its figurehead. Barely a word he spoke was true, trustworthy or even faintly plausible, yet he brandishes his charlatanry with bravado. Does it matter that there was not one specific policy, no route map out of the thickets of Brexit beyond his own breezy confidence that with his \u201cnew mandate\u201d and \u201cnew optimism\u201d he will \u201chit the road running\u201d to Brussels? Just take it on trust. Top tweet The BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson on the Tory candidates\u2019 debate:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
