With the waning of Blair's candidacy, however, and the emergence of the Belgian prime minister, Herman Van Rompuy, as frontrunner, Europe may find itself contemplating a president who can barely stop traffic in Brussels. If one expected to find in a Belgian premier a somewhat anonymous, grey-haired bureaucrat, one would not be disappointed in Van Rompuy: the 62-year-old is a former economist from his country's central bank who moved into politics in the 1970s, taking on governmental roles as minister for small enterprise and, later, budget minister. He has published six books about economics and politics and is credited as a shrewd thinker and deft politician, having succeeded, since becoming prime minister last December, in bringing a period of economic and political stability to Belgium. Previously, a turbulent period of divisions between its Flemish and French-speaking regions led some to believe the small country might split apart. The centre-right Van Rompuy is a member of the Flemish-speaking elite, but is felt to have had a better understanding of French Belgian culture than his predecessors and a more subtle gift for compromise. But if his profile on the international stage has been low in Europe, let alone beyond, the bespectacled father of four is not quite as colourless as he might first appear. His personal website prominently reproduces a number of haiku that he has composed, one of them a paean to a Brussels conference centre, and several about flies, perhaps composed during prime ministerial meetings. One of the haiku, entitled \"Fly\", translates as: \"A lost fly/ flies wanderingly in a plane/ Thus she is flying twice.\" And if his emergence as the 11-8 favourite in the bartering frenzy for the top job can be credited to a number of factors beyond his control, Van Rompuy himself has shown flashes of steel that hint at a formidable operator. Asked last week whether, given the objections to a well-known candidate taking the job, he would block Blair's candidacy, he made a pointed dig at star power over quiet efficiency: \"The future of the EU does not depend on one person; it depends on someone who will help it operate better.\" Five years ago Blair vetoed the appointment of Guy Verhofstadt, Van Rompuy's predecessor as PM, as commission president. Asked about Blair on Flemish TV last month, Van Rompuy said: \"We have not forgotten.\" He may yet have his revenge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
