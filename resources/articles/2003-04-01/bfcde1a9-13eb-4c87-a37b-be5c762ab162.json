So when the Times's Mary Ann Sieghart accepted the invitation to propose an anti-Mail motion at a debate in London last week she knew it was only a matter of time before the Associated Balaclava Boys (aka P. McKay) would be sent round. Sure enough, the very next morning, the Mail dredged up some mildly poisonous story about a head injury Ms Sieghart suffered some years back. We need not expect a similar punishment beating for the other anti-Mail speaker, Francis Wheen. As a leading Private Eye contributor, he knows where too many of the Associated bodies are buried. \u00b7 Spotted: Chris Morris outside a Soho eatery discussing plans for his new show, the first since his Brass Eye special caused, er, that bit of a fuss a while back. \"What we need now,\" said a dishevelled and taller-than-he-looks-on-the-box Morris, \"are some jokes.\" Good to see the former Day Today frontman hasn't lost his touch. \u00b7 Much excitement at the unveiling of the relaunched Financial Times, surely the bargain of the year at just \u00a33m. FT editor Andrew Gowers was understandably excited when he visited the Today programme to puff the revamped rag and its thrillingly imaginative new slogan, \"New FT, New Comment\". Brilliant, sir, quite brilliant! But it seems the excitement also affected the good people of Today, whose business presenter insisted on referring to Gowers as Andrew \"Gower\", poor chap. Given the parlous state of the FT's advertising revenues over the past month, perhaps \"New FT, Same Old Ad Slump\" would have been a more suitable slogan. \u00b7 Welcome to Monkey's Spot The Difference competition. This week's topic is the blink and you'll miss it relaunch of ITV News. Have you spotted the difference yet? Clue: what have they done with the desk? Poor old John Suchet, who presented the main evening bulletin last week, looked like he was hanging around for a taxi. Give that man his chair back. \u00b7 Greg Dyke was treading carefully at Goldsmiths College in London last week when he attacked the US broadcast media's partial reporting of the war. Asked by a student whether he thought al-Jazeera was an impartial broadcaster, he paused, before saying diplomatically: \"I haven't watched enough of it to be able to say.\" And presumably until he takes Arabic lessons, he never will. \u00b7 Sighs of relief all round as it appears Jonathan Edwards, Olympic triple jump champion and newly-appointed arbiter of all things tasteful at Ofcom, is taking his new job very seriously indeed. Why, he's even got his eyes done. \"Everyone wants perfect vision,\" says Jonathan in an ad campaign for something called, well, let's not give them the oxygen of publicity for free, eh? \"Laser eye treatment helped me, and the UK's number one could help you.\" Thanks, Jonathan. A cure for square eyes, unfortunately, appears some way off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
