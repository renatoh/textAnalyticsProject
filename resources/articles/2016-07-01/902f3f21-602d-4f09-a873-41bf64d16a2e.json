The Art Newspaper reported that after the incident on 23 December 1888, Van Gogh gave it to a young woman named Gabrielle Berlatier. She was referred to in a new book published last week \u2013 Van Gogh\u2019s Ear: The True Story. The author, Bernadette Murphy, wrote that she promised Berlatier\u2019s descendants to keep her name a secret. However, the Art Newspaper was able to determine her identity by searching records at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. \u201cIdentifying her throws fresh light on the bizarre incident in which Van Gogh cut off nearly all his ear,\u201d wrote Martin Bailey, whose book about Van Gogh in Provence is published later this year. Murphy\u2019s book details how Gabrielle was treated at the Institut Pasteur in early 1888 for rabies after being bitten by a dog. Berlatier, a farmer\u2019s daughter who lived near Arles in Provence, was taken to Paris and given a new anti-rabies vaccine that saved her life. However, the treatment had put her family in debt and she was working as a maid in a brothel on Rue du Bout d\u2019Arles. She was too young to be a registered prostitute, Murphy wrote. \u201cUntil now it has been assumed that the recipient of the ear had been a casual acquaintance of the artist, either a prostitute or the madame at the brothel,\u201d Bailey wrote in the Art Newspaper. \u201cGabrielle, an innocent victim of a rabid dog and the temporarily deranged artist within the same year, later married and lived well into old age \u2013 keeping her traumatic encounter with Van Gogh a secret.\u201d Bailey also told the BBC: \u201cNow we know the person, we can possibly find out more in future about the incident, who she was and Van Gogh\u2019s links to her.\u201d Van Gogh cut off his ear after suffering a mental breakdown, but was found the following day by police and given medical treatment. He went on to take his life in 1890."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
