Political leaders and international institutions looked forward to a time when \"democratic capitalism\" - whether in its post-cold war American version or that of social-democratic Sweden, as some bien-pensants hoped-would be accepted everywhere. This confidence was not based on any rational assessment of facts. The mania surrounding globalisation was only the latest incarnation of the Enlightenment faith that the advance of science and technology would create a universal civilisation, and predictably it was not long before it gave way to anxiety and foreboding. Islamist terrorism and the emergence of Russia as an authoritarian great power, together with American troubles in Iraq, have shattered the certainties of the 1990s. Yet the faith they expressed has not been destroyed - if anything, it is even more fervent than before. For many people the Enlightenment has become a sort of magic amulet clutched to the heart as a talisman against fear. In its most influential forms the Enlightenment has always been an ersatz religion - think of Marxism, for example - and in response to the shocks of the past years it has undergone a fundamentalist revival in much the same way that other faiths have done. Will Hutton is among these revivalists, and his new book reveals another source of the Enlightenment's renewed popularity - the mounting panic induced by the rise of China. On the first page of The Writing on the Wall he asks anxiously: \"Is the baton of global leadership going to pass from Anglo-Saxon hands, which held so many values in common, to Chinese hands? If so, the implications could not be more profound. The world would have to accommodate a wholly different civilisation and values; the character of global institutions, our culture and the primacy of our English language would be challenged.\" For Hutton this prospect is clearly unthinkable, and he goes on at once to declare that \"if the next century is going to be Chinese, it will only be because China embraces the economic and political pluralism of the West in general, and our Enlightenment institutions in particular, modified, of course, for the Chinese experience.\" The caveat is worth noting. There is nothing about accepting China on equal terms with the west - rather, \"our\" Enlightenment inheritance must be modified to ensure that China becomes western. There is no discussion of the role of European colonialism - the only empire considered at any length is the declining imperial system in 19th-century China. As Hutton sees it, Europe's hegemony was due to an \"industrial Enlightenment\", and China can hope to succeed only if it faithfully emulates our example. One difficulty with the idea that China can advance only by embracing the Enlightenment is that China adopted a version of this western faith, with near-fatal results, when Mao came to power. Mass slaughter is not unknown in China - millions died in the conflicts surrounding the Taiping rebellion in the second half of the 19th century, for example - but mass murder by Mao was part of a consistent attempt to implement a western revolutionary ideology, just as it was in the Soviet Union. Hutton's discussion of the human costs of Maoism is laboured and convoluted; but the bottom line for him seems to be that the price was worth paying. Mao completed the destruction of the imperial Confucian system and so made the China of today possible. Mao's regime must therefore - in Hutton's view - be seen as an essentially benign, progressive force. It is a questionable claim - as Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have pointed out in their superb book, Mao: The Unknown Story, it is not clear that any amount of social progress can justify the killing of 70 million people in peacetime - but it is in line with Hutton's overall argument. While noting its excesses, which he blames on Mao's personal faults as \"a callous, self-absorbed, immoral human being\", Hutton maintains that Mao's regime prepared the ground for the next phase of China's development. By waging war on China's past, Mao opened up the possibility that the country would eventually become part of the west. The core message of Hutton's book is that if only China tries harder it can achieve what he sees as the supreme prize - it can become like us. Instead China has renounced Maoism without becoming like us, and its astonishing record of economic growth over the past quarter of a century is a result of that fact. Like many western observers, Hutton struggles to grasp how this was possible. On the one hand, he insists that the conditions required for sustained economic growth are the same everywhere - as he puts it: \"Economic development follows universal rules.\" On the other he cannot help noticing that the largest economic expansion in history has occurred without any of the institutions he insists are universally necessary - such as the rule of law and property rights - being in place. In fact, as Japan did when it industrialised a century earlier, China has overturned the theories of economic growth that are conventional wisdom in the west. Hutton is adamant that China's economic success cannot be maintained unless the freedoms that are supposedly integral to the \"knowledge economy\" are introduced. But how does he know this? It is a confession of faith, which nothing in history supports. If Hutton's assertion that there are universal rules of development is unconvincing, his prescription for China is even more dubious. Like a long line of political missionaries before him he insists China must adopt western ways, but in his case these turn out to be idealised versions of distinctively Anglo-Saxon practices. While Europe may have achieved its 19th-century supremacy as a result of the Enlightenment, Hutton has no doubt that the Enlightenment's \"quintessential expression is the constitution and public processes of the United States\". So it seems the model Enlightenment regime is now Anglo-Saxon rather than French, and it is to America, not Europe, that China must look for salvation. This is a curiously anglocentric view, and one that neo-conservatives will find comforting. Hutton is no neocon but, like him, neo-conservatives see the rise of China as potentially a much greater threat than Islamist terrorism. Neo-conservatives are also evangelists for the Enlightenment, and the prospect of China becoming a great power without converting to it fills them with the same dread. Despite its shortcomings there is much to be learnt by reading The Writing on the Wall. Hutton is right to rub the noses of starry-eyed western governments and investors in the formidable difficulties China faces. Unprecedented economic growth has been accompanied by horrific environmental devastation, but if growth falters, the high levels of inequality that have developed could pose a threat to the regime's legitimacy. Chinese growth is also crucially dependent on rising imports of energy, but as Hutton points out, global oil reserves are near their peak and the incredible expansion of the past couple of decades looks unsustainable. The Chinese miracle is not disaster-proof, and could be derailed. In dispelling the illusion of stability that surrounds post-Mao China Hutton has performed a valuable service, but the chief significance of The Writing on the Wall is in the altered western mood it expresses. Behind the stale debates about human rights and cultural relativism looms the fact that western power is in decline. No longer backed up by invincible military might or unchallengeable economic primacy, western institutions are now only one way of realising universal human values. Having rejected Maoism and retaining Marxism only in name, China has set out on a path of development that owes few of its ruling ideas to the west. The outcome is uncertain, but in the end what Hutton and others like him fear most is not that the Chinese experiment will fail. It is that China will succeed. \u00b7 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia will be published by Penguin in early July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
