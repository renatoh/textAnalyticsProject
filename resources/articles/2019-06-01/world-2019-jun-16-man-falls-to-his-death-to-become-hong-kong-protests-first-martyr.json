No one knew the man\u2019s name, or why he was there, even though protesters and an opposition politician spent hours trying to persuade him to come down with hymns and exhortations. But hours after his death, the man already had a title. The mourning crowds called the 35-year-old their movement\u2019s first martyr, and wanted to remember him as they took on the government in one of the biggest marches ever seen in the city. A call to bring flowers spread quickly on social media, there were condolence books along the route of the march, and at least two makeshift shrines near its end. Peter Chan, 68, had stopped at one, bowing his head before a photograph of the man, flanked by Chinese scrolls praising his passion and his sense of justice. Incense and traditional paper offerings to the dead burned beside rows of floral tributes. \u201cHe has become the first martyr, and we don\u2019t want more,\u201d said Chan, weeping as he attacked Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam, and the campaign to pass a controversial extradition law which has plunged Hong Kong into crisis. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for one person\u2019s insistence to pass this law, this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Lam doesn\u2019t step down our anger cannot die down.\u201d The man had climbed on to scaffolding outside the Pacific Place mall on Saturday afternoon, wearing a yellow raincoat, and unfurled his handwritten protest banner. \u201cMake Love. No Shoot! No extradition to China,\u201d it said in English. Chinese characters called for the law to be withdrawn, and Lam to resign. Many details about his final hours are still unclear; police are treating the case as suicide, the Hong Kong Free Press reported. But for protesters who gathered on Sunday, his banner provided a clear, devastating link to the turmoil of the past week. \u201cI am heartbroken about the guy who died. When I learned about it I was speechless,\u201d said protester Troy Law, 29, who carried chrysanthemums, a traditional flower of mourning in China. \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, it is clear what his position was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
