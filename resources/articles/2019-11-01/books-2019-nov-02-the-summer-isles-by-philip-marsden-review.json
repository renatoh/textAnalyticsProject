Yet he decided to sail single-handed up the west coast of Ireland and the Inner Hebrides to the Summer Isles in northern Scotland. As Marsden set out in early spring, he asked himself: \u201cWhat, in God\u2019s name, have I taken on?\u201d When he was younger he often stayed with his aunt Bridget and her husband Francis in their cottage in north-west Scotland, on the banks of the upper Oykel \u201cin the wilds of Sutherland\u201d. He used to go walking with Bridget: \u201cwe developed a fascination for the strange peaks that rise from the moors of Coigach and Assynt \u2013 C\u00f9l M\u00f2r, C\u00f9l Beag, Canisp, Suilen, Quinag.\u201d It was on one of these walks, looking west over the sea in the late afternoon sun, that he first saw the Summer Isles, lying like \u201cglyphs and ciphers\u201d tooled into a \u201csheet of beaten silver\u201d. He later read that the pioneering ecologist and naturalist Frank Fraser Darling had lived on one of the islands, Tanera M\u00f2r, in the 1930s. He and Bridget decided to visit the islands, but before they could do so, she was killed in a climbing accident on Ben More Assynt. Marsden vowed that one day he would visit the Summer Isles, but as the years passed they came to symbolise the longing for a place that exists more in the imagination than in reality. His book is therefore both a travelogue and an exploration of mythical islands, those \u201cplaces just beyond our reach, places that aren\u2019t really there at all\u201d. According to Marsden, \u201cthe ability to believe in places that are invisible, to build stories around them and inhabit them, remains the defining attribute of our species\u201d. Nowhere is richer in imaginary places than the western seas, where the fickle currents, fractured coastline and constantly changing weather made crossings dangerous and deepened the mystery around those islands lost in the mist or just over the horizon. There are countless mythical islands in these waters, from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g (land of the young), Avalon, Hinba and the Green Island, to Elysium. Marsden\u2019s own home in Cornwall was once owned by a family who lost all their money in the 16th century \u201clooking for an island called Hy-Brasil\u201d. Marsden\u2019s odyssey in his wooden boat, Tsambika, takes him up the western fringe of the archipelago \u2013 \u201cEurope\u2019s dreaming frontier\u201d \u2013 through a rich territory of real and imagined places. There are memorable historical anecdotes and encounters with local people on the islands he visits, such as the crofter and poet John Purser on Skye, whose words appear on the beams of Edinburgh\u2019s Library of Scottish Poetry: \u201cA nation is forged in the hearth of poetry.\u201d There is real danger, too, as Marsden faces violent storms and even a powerful whirlpool. But as he says, \u201cLooking for imaginary places isn\u2019t meant to be easy.\u201d He writes beautifully, and transforms what could easily have been a conventional travel book into something far more evocative and personal: \u201ca sea journey is a passage of the soul\u201d. The harsh coastal landscapes and shifting moods of the sea are vividly described. But what is so memorable and indeed magical is the way he interweaves the imaginary and the real. In these islands at the edge of the Atlantic, staring out into \u201cthe endless blue of the west\u201d, he finds a rich tradition of myth, poetry and ancient lore that still speaks to us across the gulf of time. \u2022 The Summer Isles is published by Granta (\u00a320).
