To me, there\u2019s no room for Zoom.\u201d Live-streamed comedy was quick into the breach when IRL gigs were cancelled \u2013 and we\u2019re all invested in trying to make it as successful as possible. But: are they an adequate substitute for the experience they\u2019ve replaced? To Norris, live-streaming \u201csacrifices a lot of the things I love about live comedy in favour of preserving interactivity\u201d. You get something approximating to the live experience. But do you get much else? Norris\u2019s response is to turn to film-making. Before the festival was cancelled, he had a show ready for Edinburgh 2020, about his recent experience of moving house \u2013 and losing himself, he felt, while doing so. The show, so specific to this moment in his life, couldn\u2019t wait until 2021. He didn\u2019t want to can it altogether \u2013 but neither did live-streaming appeal. So Norris has turned You Build the Thing You Think You Are into a 50-minute film. It now has a seven-day run online, with each screening followed by a live Q&amp;A. It\u2019s well worth a look. It doesn\u2019t interact with its audience; Norris has fun, indeed, with its inability to do so. In his 2019 fringe offering, he appeared in disguise (outsize beard, sunglasses and sun hat) as nonsense alter ego Mr Fruit Salad. In You Build the Thing \u2026, he does something similar, capering around behind the mask of a \u201ctroll/goblin\u201d, winding up his non-existent crowd. Norris himself intervenes, wresting back control of the show/film, which devolves into something less anarchic and more confessional. What Norris misses in Zoom comedy, he says, is the \u201ccareful craft [and] loving construction\u201d you find in the best fringe shows. That\u2019s abundantly on display here, as the film flits between narrator Joz speaking directly to us, character Joz in the story, and the outpourings of their fertile imagination. The story it tells is of a pivotal moment in Norris\u2019s life, as he leaves the flatshare where he spent his 20s. OK, so that old Brixton flat didn\u2019t add up to much. \u201cThis is not a room for a person,\u201d his landlord\u2019s wife says of his bedroom. \u201cThis is a room for old boots and broken things.\u201d But it gave Norris a sense of himself that he loses entirely when obliged to relocate. You can imagine the show it would have made onstage \u2013 something like Daniel Kitson\u2019s 66A Church Road, perhaps, another hymn to a well-loved home. Spliced with that moment in Mat Ewins\u2019 2017 show when Ewins pulls back the curtain on all the silliness: the subtext of You Build the Thing \u2026 is Norris\u2019s loss of confidence, as he enters his 30s, in his identity as a funny man. There\u2019s no real apotheosis here; you wait in vain for Norris\u2019s quiet crises to reach their resolution. What is conclusive, though, is the success of the material\u2019s transfer to film. Shot almost entirely in Norris\u2019s new house, it\u2019s tightly edited, enjoyably meta, full of sly visual touches \u2013 and really does recreate the spirit of the creative live comedy Norris misses so much. Those who love that brand of comedy equally may share Norris\u2019s scepticism of laughter-by-live-stream \u2013 a scepticism that maps on to lockdown-era comedy an existing schism, between entertainers and artists, club comics and \u201ccreative\u201d comics (for want of a better term). The former would prioritise the hurly-burly and spontaneity of liveness; the latter put craft and construction on a higher pedestal. For them, Norris\u2019s You Build the Thing \u2026 will be as much of a treat as an earlier and even more rewarding standup-to-film transfer, Tim Key\u2019s Megadate (or Wonderdate, in the BBC version). Vive la difference, I say, while feeling lucky that lockdown, if it\u2019s dented comedians\u2019 incomes, is doing nothing to dent their creativity. \u2022 20-26 July on Vimeo.
