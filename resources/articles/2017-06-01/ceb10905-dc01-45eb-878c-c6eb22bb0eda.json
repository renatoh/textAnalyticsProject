The public and blunt criticism of Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates marked a sharp about-turn from Donald Trump\u2019s wholehearted backing for the embargo, and his accusations of terrorist funding against Qatar. It follows a increasing pattern in which the state and defence departments have pursued policies abroad that are far removed from Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cNow that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the Qataris, nor to the public, the details about the claims they are making toward Qatar,\u201d Heather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman said. \u201cThe more that time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,\u201d she added. \u201cAt this point, we are left with one simple question: were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar\u2019s alleged support for terrorism? Or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries?\u201d Trump was feted by Saudi Arabia when he made Riyadh the destination of his first trip abroad as president, on 20 May. Riyadh declared its embargo on Qatar just over two weeks later and Trump made repeated statements in support of the move, appearing to take at face value Riyadh\u2019s justification that it was to punish Doha for its backing of terrorist groups. In a tweet on June 6, Trump even appeared to claim credit for the blockade, suggesting it showed that his trip to Riyadh was \u201cpaying off\u201d \u201cThe nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden three days later. \u201cWe have to stop the funding of terrorism.\u201d But last week, the defence secretary, James Mattis, signed an arms deal in which the US sold Qatar 36 F-15 fighter planes, worth $12bn. In her remarks on Tuesday, Nauert denied that the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was taking a position that entirely contradicted the initial stance adopted by Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think so at all. I think the president and the secretary both want to see this resolved. They want results, and let\u2019s see this resolved quickly,\u201d Nauert said. She added that Tillerson no longer saw any need to act as a mediator in the Qatar dispute. Nauert said Tillerson had spent the two weeks since the embargo talking to the protagonists and regional leaders in person and on the phone, but no longer saw any point in continuing mediation. \u201cThe president had offered secretary Tillerson weeks ago to do that. At this point, we don\u2019t think that is necessary. We believe through the secretary\u2019s talks, through talking with those nations and hearing what they have to say, that they\u2019ll be able to work this out on their own,\u201d Nauert said. She added: \u201cThere comes a certain point where you say, folks, let\u2019s get this done, let\u2019s get moving along. The secretary likes results.\u201d Days before the embargo was declared, the Qatari state news agency was hacked and a report planted that quoted the emir as casting doubt on how long Trump would last in office, advocating closer ties with Iran and supporting Hamas. The report on 23 May was one of the pretexts for the punitive measures imposed on Qatar. Egypt and Bahrain also cut ties with Gulf nation. On Tuesday, Qatar\u2019s attorney general claimed that the hack had come from the countries imposing the embargo. \u201cQatar has evidence that certain iPhones originating from countries laying siege to Qatar were used in the hack,\u201d Ali Bin Fetais al-Marri told reporters in Doha. He did not name the countries, but an FBI investigation is reported to have pointed towards Russian hackers hired by Gulf clients. The Gulf dispute is just one of several issues on which the state and defence departments appear to follow a different tack from the president. The divergence is particularly evident in matters connected to Russia. Tillerson and Mattis, supported by most congressional Republicans, have insisted sanctions on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, remain in place until the Kremlin withdraws its forces. Trump has quietly sought to have the sanctions lifted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
