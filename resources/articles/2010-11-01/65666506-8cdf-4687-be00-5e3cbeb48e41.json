We should have finished them off before we did. The first half was desperately poor from both sides. The changes we made were obvious, so I wouldn't really credit the manager with too much, but Ross Wallace made the difference \u2013 he scored the equaliser and set up the winner. In the end, we scraped it against a poor side \u2013 and with an iffy decision at that. Who played well/who had a nightmare? No one else really stood out. Brian Easton played well at left-back \u2013 it was only his second game this season, and he did what could be expected. It was my first look at the goalie [Lee Grant], who was quite solid. Jamie Smith, twitter.com/jambothejourno Crystal Palace 2-0 Coventry City Was it a good match? Two wins in a week \u2013 that's very good news for us at the moment. Now we've got Darren Ambrose and Neil Danns back we're looking more assured, making fewer mistakes and playing with more confidence. Coventry had a few decent chances to take the lead but it was a strange situation with a backpass that resulted in the first goal, after their keeper picked it up to give us a close-range free-kick. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Obviously Ambrose with his two goals, and Juli\u00e1n Speroni made an outstanding save in the second half to keep us 1-0 ahead. Peter Guntrip, Holmesdale.net Ipswich Town 1-3 Barnsley Was it a good match? We started quite brightly, and then as soon as we conceded it turned into a disgusting and thoroughly spineless display. Without being particularly exciting, Barnsley stuck to their task, played football and did their job reasonably well. Smith pulled a goal back, but we never looked like getting back in it - in fact 3-1 flattered Ipswich. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Tamas Priskin for us was man of the match by far, and Roy Keane got the loudest boos of the day when he took him off after the hour. Keane has produced a team that's capable of some of the dullest football we've ever seen at Portman Road. Julian Watkins, TractorBoys.com Leeds United 3-1 Bristol City Was it a good match? It was a good game in the end. After an uninspiring first hour, it sparked into life in the last half-hour. It looked a 0-0 until the substitutions, which completely changed the game. Within a few minutes of Luciano Becchio coming on he'd scored. I was surprised he wasn't on from the start, but the manager said he wanted to give him a rest. But when you're playing one up front, you need a target man like that. Who played well/who had a nightmare? The subs, Becchio and Lloyd Sam, looked very lively. Hard to fault one player for their goal \u2013 everyone seemed to go to sleep. Andy Baggott, TheFootballNetwork.net Leicester City 2-0 Derby County Was it a good match? In contrast to the badly observed silence before the game, the match unfolded into a superb game of football. Both sides kept it on the deck, and it was a great advert for the Championship. We deservedly led through Andy King's beautifully worked goal. Derby came back strongly and opened up our defence on several occasions, but we made them pay for their missed chances and saw the game out easily in front of our biggest crowd of the season. Who played well/who had a nightmare? No duds in the Leicester team today but credit has to go to Steve Howard, who led the line magnificently. Simon Kimber, Observer reader Millwall 0-1 Sheffield United Was it a good match? We played quite well in the first half and created a lot of opportunities but just didn't take them. Their goal came totally against the run of play and it was a real sucker punch we never really recovered from. In the first half we were profligate but in the second, problems emerged all over the pitch \u2013 we just didn't play well at all. Who played well/who had a nightmare? There were no real standout performances on either team. They didn't play particularly well and their goal was a gift. James Henry was maybe our worst player but a lot were culpable. Charlie Mahoney, Observer reader Nottingham Forest 0-0 QPR Was it a good match? It wasn't the highest quality match, and you could tell both teams have had a lot of draws this season. QPR had the better chances in the first half \u2013 Lee Camp made two good saves from Adel Taarabt, who was clearly their danger man. We did improve in the second half, but only when we switched to a 4-4-2 did we look dangerous \u2013 that's when Lewis McGugan forced a good save from Paddy Kenny. Who played well/who had a nightmare? The player who stood out was Dele Adebola, mainly because he was doing everything Forest hadn't been able to do until he came on \u2013 holding it up, and bringing other people into play. Rish Barauah, EighteenSixtyFive.co.uk Portsmouth 2-3 Doncaster Was it a good match? Doncaster mugged us in both halves in two very different ways. In the first, they took advantage of some indifferent defending, though their second should have been a free-kick for a foul on Michael Brown. We scored two scrappy goals, and Doncaster seemed to be there for the taking, but we gave David Healy too much space, and he's got the skill to find the net from 20 yards. Who played well/who had a nightmare? John Utaka was our best player by a mile \u2013 he terrorised Rovers throughout. Carl Dickinson's tackle was a clear red card, and his ban might be a blessing in disguise. Colin Farmery, Pompey-Fans.com Reading 3-3 Norwich City Was it a good match? You can certainly expect entertainment when you come to the Madejski! In the first half Norwich deservedly went 3-1 in front \u2013 they tore us to pieces, though we helped them with some pretty woeful defending. The sending-off changed the game, as Grant Holt was Norwich's best player until he hit the self-destruct button with a pretty nasty challenge. I knew we'd come out fighting, and we battered them in the second half. I'm happy with a point, but we could have had all three. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Jobi McAnuff really stepped up in the second half \u2013 he was excellent for us. Nick Deaves, Observer reader Scunthorpe United 2-4 Cardiff City Was it a good match? The two early goals really seemed to deflate us \u2013 heads dropped and it seemed like it would be a long afternoon. When Bothroyd scored the third, it seemed there was no way back for us. Thankfully, Kevin McDonald gave us something to cheer about before half-time, and when Dany N'Guessan scored our second there looked to be light at the end of the tunnel. But hope turned to despair as soon as Seyi Olofinjana hit their fourth. It just wasn't our day. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Olofinjana had a great game and was their best player. For us, N'Guessan looked promising. Jordan Griffin, Scunthorpe.Vitalfootball.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
