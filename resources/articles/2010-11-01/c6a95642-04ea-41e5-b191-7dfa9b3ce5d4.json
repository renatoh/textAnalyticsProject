Ambition is not everything England are not afraid of the ball. They kicked from hand far less in this autumn series than in the other two they have played under Martin Johnson and they are now prepared to attack from anywhere on the pitch and no longer content to play at a slow tempo. Their game has taken two years to evolve. On Saturday England passed the ball less frequently than they did against South Africa in 2008, when they moved the ball wide without creating space and kept getting knocked back behind the gain line on their way to a 42-6 defeat. They are more discriminating now, even if there were elements of desperation later on Saturday, and in Ben Foden, Chris Ashton and Mark Cueto they have a back three to match any in the world in terms of potency. On Saturday Foden, the full-back, covered more ground with the ball in hand than the entire Springbok back division and Cueto came close to matching him. 2. Lawes will be a lock star In Courtney Lawes England have found a lock forward of exceptional potential. He is different in style from Johnson, who led his country to World Cup victory. The 21-year-old from Northampton is quicker, for a start, but he is also prepared to get stuck in. His opposite number, Bakkies Botha, may have successfully played the enforcer role at Twickenham but Lawes will impose himself in the coming years. England will question whether the back five gave the front row enough support as South Africa targeted the scrums but Lawes looks to be one of those rare second-rows who is comfortable playing it loose or tight and his boiler-room partnership with Tom Palmer was one of the key features of an encouraging month. 3. Pressure tells The Tri-Nations teams do not win the vast majority of their tour matches by accident. They generally keep their composure in the most tense moments and have a facility for winning even when playing below their best, as New Zealand showed once again in Cardiff. England stayed in the game against South Africa through their defence, at one point in the first half making three try-saving tackles in as many minutes, but they were less effective when they had the ball in hand. They also wasted opportunities against New Zealand, Australia and Samoa and, while there were mitigating factors on Saturday, such as the injuries to the fly-half Toby Flood and Ashton, the wing who only touched the ball five times after taking a bang on the head, Lawes's failure to release Cueto when the game was still within reach was followed quickly by Lwazi Mvovo's conclusive try. 4. Six Nations success seems likely England are favourites to win the Six Nations. That is hardly surprising in one sense, with France shipping 59 points to Australia, Wales having failed to win in seven, Ireland struggling up front and Scotland feisty but try-shy. But England are probably in their best shape since they won the World Cup seven years ago. They have a settled side, even if they could do with more competition in certain positions and the loss of Tom Croft will be felt. Their opening game in the championship will be revelatory, as they face Wales at the Millennium Stadium on a Friday night. England have not won in Cardiff since 2003. They outscored Wales on tries there last year but what they have to take from this autumn is that Test rugby is about being pragmatic, not living up to an ideal. England can now play the game in more than one way and can react to changing circumstances. The Tri-Nations countries hold sway but England are the best of the rest. 5. Wilko is not out It says something about how England have progressed that the absence of Jonny Wilkinson has hardly been mentioned. The Toulon fly-half is again struggling with an injury. If fit he will surely be one of the first players inked into the World Cup squad but he is no longer seen as a starter. As the All Blacks have found over the years, World Cups \u2013 at the knockout stage, at least \u2013 are less about current form and more about rising to a one-off occasion. There is still no one better than Wilkinson at closing out tight matches, as he showed in Sydney in the summer, and the new England has to be about substance as well as style. Well might Dan Carter, the New Zealand fly-half, have reacted instantly last week when asked if Wilkinson's international career looked to be over. Not with a World Cup on the horizon, Carter replied. What has changed is that for England, Wilkinson is now Plan B."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
