Should we get rid of them?", "bodyText": "The first mistake people often make when they talk about juries is to say that they\u2019re necessary and important because they\u2019ve \u201calways\u201d been part of the justice system. As though 1) the justice system doesn\u2019t grow and change, and 2) the way it\u2019s always been is the way it needs to be. There\u2019s a lot wrong with Australia\u2019s current jury system, but more importantly, there\u2019s a lot of simple, easy stuff we can do that would go a long way to fixing it. When jury trials first started in Australia, only land-owning men of a certain means would be called for duty. Criminal laws (and therefore laws around juries) are legislated by state, not federally, in Australia. Queensland was the first state to allow women to serve on juries, and that was back in 1924, but according to the state library of Queensland\u2019s archives, the first female juror wasn\u2019t actually empanelled until 1945. Victoria didn\u2019t catch on until 1975, and when women first started serving on juries, the Sydney Morning Herald reported they were being paid nine shillings a day compared with men receiving 16 shillings and twopence per day. Our jury system has been, and may continue to be, flawed. It will always be in need of improvement. Our justice system is supposed to serve our society as it grows and changes. A couple of weeks ago I spoke on ABC Radio National with Assoc Prof Jacqueline Horan, the author of Juries in the 21st Century. Most of our conversation focused on the point of empanelment and pre-emptive challenges. It\u2019s an issue I express a lot of frustration about in my own book, Eggshell Skull, and one I have also personally experienced. A \u201cpre-emptory challenge\u201d is an opportunity for either the prosecution or defence counsel to veto a potential juror from being empanelled without having to give any reason or justification. In practice these challenges are barely used by prosecution but are considered a long-held right of a defendant. Most frequently, women, young people and non-Caucasian people are challenged. The problem is that a jury is supposed to be a randomly selected representative cross-section of society. Pre-emptive challenges stop this from happening. In Queensland there are eight challenges, but in Victoria they\u2019ve acknowledged the problem of bias and dropped it down to four. Better still, in the UK \u2013 from where we got this whole system \u2013 they\u2019ve abolished the process of pre-emptive challenges. When I was a judge\u2019s associate in Queensland, I frequently saw defence barristers use up most, if not all, of their challenges. In a state where they are allowed eight, that can have a huge impact on the makeup of a panel. One of the roles of an associate is to pull names out of the barrel and call people to be empanelled. Where I would call out the names and numbers of potential jurors, in other states they might also announce the person\u2019s profession, and in others the number only with no names. The critical problem, though, is that all jurisdictions allow counsel to take a good look at the individual \u2013 making immediate assessments of age, gender and race. I remember watching the potential jurors file into the courtroom for my own trial, and a person watching the trial, Alex, coming out after empanelment was finished. \u201cThey challenged all the women,\u201d Alex said, emerging from the courtroom about 20 minutes later. I just laughed and shook my head. A bitter laugh. \u201cBut there are still four.\u201d \u201cStill four?\u201d I asked quickly. \u201cYep, it was pretty funny, actually. It was so obvious what they were doing, but the associate just kept pulling out women\u2019s names and they ran out of challenges.\u201d The second phase is no less flawed. Once the jurors are empanelled, things become extremely opaque. It\u2019s illegal for jurors to talk about their deliberations with anyone outside the jury room. We do this to avoid the heinous spectacle that the US system suffers from (where jurors sign book deals before they\u2019ve even delivered a verdict) and to ensure that no external pressures or perceptions shape a jury\u2019s decision. It also makes research and reflection on the process difficult. New South Wales is currently reviewing its sexual assault and consent legislation. The Saturday Paper recently reported on Karen Willis, the executive officer of Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, arguing that the review is too narrow and needs to take a broader view of the inequalities of the current trial process \u2013 including juries. Her organisation\u2019s submission to the review includes a recommendation to eliminate juries in sexual assault trials. Instead, a specially trained judge would make findings of both fact and law because \u201cjuries often lack the knowledge of trauma required to make sound judgements [sic] in sexual assault matters\u201d. This is a question I\u2019m frequently asked: should we get rid of juries altogether? New Zealand has been trialling a judge-only model for sexual assault matters and it\u2019s had a positive effect on wait times and complainant experiences. In other countries they have a combination of judges and expert non-lawyers too. There are all kinds of alternative models. The jury in my case found the defendant guilty of both counts, so of course I feel like they \u201cgot it right\u201d, but consent was not a live issue at my trial. Many women have written to me describing their disappointment that the jury were told of their sexual history and depression medication, and that they froze instead of fighting back, and that the defendant was subsequently acquitted. Willis is right that juries don\u2019t have enough information to make sound judgments. My frustration is that getting rid of juries may be a shortcut to justice for complainants. It provides temporary relief to those going through the system right now, but really we need to get to a point where instead of just bypassing juries, we help these members of the public actually do justice. There are huge advantages to having members of the public coming into courts, interacting with our justice system, and then taking what they\u2019ve learned and experienced back out into the community. If we updated our attitudes towards consent and sex offences \u2013 including our attitudes to \u201cfreeze\u201d responses and childhood trauma \u2013 imagine what a powerful tool for understanding and education the courts could be. To get to this point juries would need to hear from expert witnesses who explain normal trauma responses. They could be informed by an expert about the reasons a complainant has waited several years before being emotionally ready to make a complaint, instead of their \u201cinexplicable delay\u201d harming their credibility. There\u2019s even an option to have a complainant stepped through their evidence-in-chief and cross-examination by a court-appointed third party not paid for by the accused, leading to a gentler and more respectful process. The potential beauty of a jury is when it represents a true, random cross-section of our society and peers. It means we are judged by one of our own. This is not possible with pre-emptive challenges the way they currently exist across Australia. The other potential beauty of a jury is how it can be a tool for learning and understanding. States that have positive definitions of consent (that is, if it\u2019s not an explicit \u201cyes\u201d, then it\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d) result in 12 people being educated on that fair definition, who then take that message back out into the world with them. If getting rid of juries is the only way to ensure justice in sex offence trials, then let it be done. I just wish we\u2019d try a little harder to get them right first. \u2022 Bri Lee is the author of Eggshell Skull"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
