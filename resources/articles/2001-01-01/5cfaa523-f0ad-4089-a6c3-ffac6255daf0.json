I take it on adventures and on family holidays and it always comes in handy. A luxury: A good book. I find it very relaxing to sit back, put my feet up, and take in a good read. I like books by other adventurers and reading about their challenges - I especially enjoyed Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. A memento: My family often give me things to take away with me - paintings by the kids, pictures, or a present of some sort. If I'm away from home over Christmas or my birthday, they give me something to open on the day. And grandmother always knits me something. If only: I would love to be able to take a few loaves of fresh bread away on adventures with me, and fresh fruit. And a shower would be nice. Best of all would be to take my family, but they probably wouldn't want to come. \u0095 Pete Goss is currently working towards the next Goss Challenges adventure - the Atlantic Row, which departs in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
