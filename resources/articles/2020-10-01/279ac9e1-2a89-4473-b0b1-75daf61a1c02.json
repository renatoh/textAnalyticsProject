Barclay played in the AFLW for Greater Western Sydney Giants after a previous career in baseball, during which she represented Australia. She also played American football both in Australia and the US before returning to the game she grew up with when the AFLW competition began in 2017. \u201cShe was a shining comet that soared through this world casting her radiant light of love on all she met,\u201d Barclay\u2019s family said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThough that comet has now shattered into a million pieces, the memory of it will remain a beacon for all women in high profile sports to strive to excel, to dare to be great while staying humble and proud.\u201d Barclay made 23 appearances for the Giants over four seasons after being drafted with pick 65 in the inaugural draft. \u201cJacinda was a much-loved member of the Giants family and we are all devastated by her passing,\u201d said Giants chief executive David Matthews. \u201cJacinda gave up a great deal to follow her sporting dreams around the world and we are grateful that she called our club home for four years. \u201cAs an inaugural Giants AFLW player, Jacinda was a vital part of our club. More than that though, Jacinda\u2019s spirit and infectious personality made her a popular and unforgettable member of the Giants family. She will always be a part of our club.\u201d The AFL\u2019s head of women\u2019s football, Nicole Livingstone, said she was deeply saddened to hear of Barclay\u2019s passing. \u201cThere are few words that we can express at this time, other than to convey our sadness and sincerest condolences to the Barclay family,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cJacinda\u2019s loss will be taken very hard by so many people within our game across all levels.\u201d As a pitcher, Barclay appeared at five baseball World Cups between 2008 and 2016, winning a silver medal in 2010. \u201cJacinda made a significant contribution not only to our sport over a long period of time but a number of other sports, on and off the field,\u201d Baseball Australia chief executive Cam Vale said. \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by Jacinda\u2019s passing and the loss of a member of our tight-knit baseball community.\u201d Her American football career included a spell with the NSW Surge in the inaugural season of LFL Australia before she was poached by Chicago Bliss for America\u2019s Legends Football League in 2016, when she won a championship in her first season. Steph Mur, one of Barclay\u2019s gridiron teammates, said the Western Australian athlete was \u201cevery coach and player\u2019s dream\u201d. \u201cThe news is devastating and our hearts are breaking,\u201d Mur wrote. \u201cJacinda lived a life that most people could only imagine. She was an elite multi-sport athlete constantly shredding boundaries around the world. \u201cShe was every coach and players\u2019 dream \u2013 a fearless leader full of positivity, vast knowledge, eagerness to grow, and dedication to every team member. More importantly, she was an all-around badass person.\u201d Barclay had been placed on the Giants\u2019 inactive list for the upcoming 2021 season, which meant she was still a GWS player, but unavailable for selection.
