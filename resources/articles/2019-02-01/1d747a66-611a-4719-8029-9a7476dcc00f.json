We were exposed to several incredible artists in childhood too.\u201d But despite developing a love of art, the boys were uncomfortable in what they saw as the elitist air of galleries ... another factor that would lead them to their destiny. Today, Edward, 37, and George, 35, run a marketplace that connects artists with art collectors online. The mission is to provide artists with a sustainable income, and potential buyers with a means of discovering art in their own homes. \u201cProbably, without ever really knowing it, we were programmed to go down a path like Bluethumb,\u201d Edward says. Digital disruptors of the art world The brothers went away to get educated \u2013 George studied computer science at RMIT and Edward became a chartered accountant \u2013 but before long, they were drawn back together. \u201cA group of George\u2019s friends were artists and musicians,\u201d Edward says. \u201cThe musicians had SoundCloud as an outlet for their music, but the artists had nowhere to sell their art online. \u201cWe also thought there must be everyday people like us who love art but don\u2019t go to galleries. At that time there was a major shift towards markets moving online in everything except art, so we thought, why don\u2019t we build it?\u201d And they did, launching Bluethumb in January 2012. Seven years later, the online gallery is run by a team of 15 people. It has sold 15,000 original artworks, and represents 10,000 Australian artists, 100 of whom have been able to quit their day jobs and produce art full-time. Seeing artists do that has been one of the most satisfying parts of the journey, says George. The start-up grind \u201cIt\u2019s not easy building a start-up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut compared to being a career artist, we have it easy. Edward, 37, and George, 35, run a marketplace that connects artists with art collectors online There have been struggles and setbacks as any challenger to the status quo will tell you, disrupting an industry takes grit and persistence. A prominent impact investor told them their mission didn\u2019t have an impact. In 2012, investors told them no one would ever buy art online. In 2014 other investors told them no one would ever spend more than $1000 on art without seeing it in the flesh. Raising capital and managing cashflow have been major challenges. But after running the business bootstrapped for the first four years, the brothers secured investment from Adam Schwab and Jeremy Same, co-founders of the travel company Luxury Escapes. Then, in 2017, when things were \u201ctouch and go\u201d, according to Edward, they received a new round of investment, from QUT Creative Enterprise Australia and Grand Prix Capital. \u201cFor startups the biggest challenge is not dying,\u201d George says. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned over the last seven years that perseverance in the face of daily obstacles is key.\u201d Together apart The Bluethumb setup is pretty minimalist. \u201cOur website, app and staff are literally all we have,\u201d George says. \u201cHalf the team is remote, and we rely on cloud and comms tools like Slack, Trello, GitHub, Stripe, Intercom, Google Apps and InVision to stay in touch, and manage our development and customer service.\u201d Ed and George with the team at the 2016 Xmas party The brothers\u2019 skills blend beautifully. Edward runs the Adelaide office and is in charge of operational and finance roles. George runs the Melbourne office and looks after technology and managing people. \u201cIt\u2019s like natural family dynamics where people gravitate towards their interests,\u201d Edward says. For George, building an amazing website and app has been his main focus from the beginning. \u201cI think not coming from an art background has helped us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve come at the problem with fresh eyes, and tried to design the easiest platform for our users. \u201cComing from a software design background, I\u2019ve always believed that the best product wins.\u201d Supporting indigenous art In 2017, with their business growing rapidly, the brothers faced a choice: launch outside Australia, or build a remote Aboriginal art centre program. They chose the latter. \u201cIn remote communities art sales are often the only source of earning income,\u201d George says. \u201cBut these communities have only been able to sell art to visitors who can make it to these remote places, through fine art galleries or at art fairs. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can to improve this. More than a quarter of Australia\u2019s remote indigenous art centres list their artists with us.\u201d Edward says it\u2019s this focus on people \u2013 artists, collectors and the team \u2013 that has been the secret of Bluethumb\u2019s success. \u201cWe have an amazing rapport with so many creative folk who are our biggest advocates, and word of mouth is still the most powerful channel.\u201d Decades on from their dabbling in dad\u2019s art, and dinnertime conversations about business, the brothers say it seems inevitable that they would work together. And they have no regrets. \u201cFounders falling out is the number one reason for startup failure,\u201d Edward says. \u201cWe\u2019ve at least eliminated one of the biggest risks. We\u2019re brothers; we won\u2019t fall out over business.\u201d Grow your business with a Brother at your side."}, "isHosted": false}}}
