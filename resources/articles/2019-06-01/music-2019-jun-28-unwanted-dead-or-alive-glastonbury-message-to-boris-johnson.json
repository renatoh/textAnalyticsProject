This year, the inspiration for some of the most potent political messaging was one looming theme: the prospect of a Boris Johnson premiership. As the late-night venue Shangri-La prepared to open on Thursday night, the familiar face of the Conservative leadership frontrunner was seen around the site. Alongside the subversive mock-advertisements with anti-capitalist slogans and climate change warnings, a Stanley Donwood print featuring the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP sat proudly centre stage. \u201cUnwanted: dead or alive \u2013 Boris \u2018the\u2019 Johnson,\u201d the header on the print read. \u201c52 years old, 5\u2019 9\u201d, pale complexion, British-American, bellowing voice, annoying hair \u2026 stupid arse.\u201d \u201cPeople want them and they\u2019re starting to print them out and put them up off their own back,\u201d said Kaye Dunnings, the creative director of Shangri-La. \u201cPeople feel now that they can be openly political and provocative \u2013 and that clear messaging works.\u201d The posters, which were originally made during the 2016 Tory leadership race, are just one of several anti-Johnson statements made by artists and musicians at the festival. As the main stages opened on Friday, Glastonbury\u2019s first headliner Stormzy was set to become the first black British solo artist to top the bill on the Pyramid stage, bringing grime to a mass audience. The last time Stormzy played the festival in 2017, the rapper whose real name is Michael Omari demanded the government was \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the Grenfell fire. His first No 1 song, Vossi Bop, which topped the charts in May, included the lyrics \u201cFuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d and the BBC was expected to broadcast an uncensored live feed of his set on Friday night. As well as the surreal takedowns of the politician who is favourite to become the next prime minister, there was disparaging work with a musical edge. Jonny Banger, a fashion designer who operates under the moniker of Sports Banger, hosts a \u201cMega Rave\u201d on Saturday at the Stonebridge Bar, where 300 anti-Johnson T-shirts will be given away for free. Accompanied by the caption \u201cBumboys, hot totty and piccaninnies: Boris Johnson\u2019s long record of sexist, homophobic and racist comments\u201d, Wright is also selling his anti-Boris T-shirts for \u00a315 online. Banger \u2013 whose bootleg fashion label uses well-known logos such as the Nike swoosh and combines them with others, such as the NHS logo, said: \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen myself as doing political T-shirts. But it got to the point where I was so angry and wanted to use the T-shirts to say something. He\u2019s vile. He can\u2019t answer a straight question. This country is built on class and favour rather than merit, and he\u2019s pushing that narrative again. The T-shirts are born out of frustration.\u201d In what was described by an audience member as a \u201cvery brave\u201d move on Friday, Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate, appeared on stage at Glastonbury\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Forum. to boos. Members of the audience unveiled a banner reading: \u201cTory policy kills. Don\u2019t greenwash the lives lost to austerity.\u201d Goldsmith, who is supporting the Uxbridge MP in the leadership race, said he would not be going to any anti-Johnson raves. \u201cI can imagine what happens there and I\u2019m not sure I would be the most welcome guest,\u201d he said. As the festival gates opened on Wednesday, attendees were welcomed with new work from the anti-Brexit artists Cold War Steve and Led By Donkeys, who collaborated on a billboard that overlooked the entire festival site. A Johnson tweet from July 2017 \u2013 which read \u201cThere\u2019s no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal\u201d \u2013 was placed next to Cold War Steve\u2019s signature surreal photoshopped images of politicians and pop culture figures juxtaposed with the EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. For Jane Tapp, a lecturer from Nottingham, Glastonbury has always been about politics, as well as music. \u201cSome people who wouldn\u2019t usually bother about politics might see something here that gets them interested,\u201d she said. Paul Scotting, also a Nottingham-based lecturer, said the reaction to Johnson\u2019s political rise risked trivialising him. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad situation and he\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all do it, but that\u2019s where he got where he is \u2013 by being a joke.\u201d Justine and Mike Duffy, at Glastonbury for the first time with their daughters, were less critical. \u201cThere are a lot of children around and people are here to forget about all of that,\u201d said Justine, a teaching assistant from Manchester. While Mike, who works in sales, said Johnson would not be his first choice for prime minister, he said he didn\u2019t support the \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d of him. \u201cI think he could lose interest very quickly when the going gets tough,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing mayor of London is a different proposition from being head of state.\u201d Earlier this week, footage emerged of Johnson at the festival in 2000, where he took part in a walkabout tour with Billy Bragg, performed part of the Iliad and said there were lots of \u201cnatural Tories\u201d at the festival who had a \u201cstrong libertarian ideology\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
