        "bodyText": "LIVERPOOL Season\u2019s high in Europe For all that they fell behind after conceding a humiliating goal \u2013 from an indirect free-kick, Simon Mignolet having been penalised for holding on to the ball \u2013 the 2-1 home win against Bordeaux in November was a high point. Christian Benteke scored once and had two goals disallowed, also winning the penalty from which James Milner equalised, in an impressive performance that suggested the Belgian could become the prolific forward he had been for Aston Villa. He has scored twice since, and not at all in 2016. Season\u2019s low in Europe Liverpool\u2019s run has featured three 1-1 draws and two 0-0 stalemates but it was one of the former that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. When Sion visited Anfield in October, Brendan Rodgers picked a young side that, despite taking the lead in the fourth minute, proved wasteful in attack and shaky in defence. Nathaniel Clyne\u2019s error helped Sion equalise in the 17th minute and, many spurned chances later, the final whistle prompted boos from the fans. Three days later, Rodgers was sacked. Manager\u2019s European record Nearly 16 years younger than Louis van Gaal, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has managed three clubs and none come close to the might of some of the Dutchman\u2019s previous employers. Though he led Borussia Dortmund to two league titles, his European experience is relatively slim \u2013 57 matches \u2013 and Borussia\u2019s run to the 2013 Champions League final represents the only occasion he has coaxed a team beyond the quarter-finals of a continental competition. Players\u2019 Euro pedigree Only two players boast winner\u2019s medals from European competitions: Daniel Sturridge, who was on Chelsea\u2019s bench when they won the Champions League in 2012, and Alberto Moreno, a member of Sevilla\u2019s Europa League-winning side in 2014. James Milner, with 67 European appearances, and Kolo Tour\u00e9, with 81 \u2013 including the 2006 Champions League final when at Arsenal \u2013 stand out in a squad lacking top-level experience. Reason to be cheerful Klopp remains an engaging, charismatic and entertaining character, and if he has struggled to instantly translate his German success into English it remains far too early to judge him. Reason to be fearful A squad low on depth and quality that seems to be resolutely refusing to improve. Klopp\u2019s arrival was followed by a run of one defeat in 11 matches, including a thrilling 4-1 success at Manchester City, but they have not sustained that level of performance and their last 11 games have included four wins, five draws and the disappointment of losing the Capital One Cup final to City on penalties. MANCHESTER UNITED Season\u2019s high in Europe In total contrast to the away leg, at times in their home game against Midtjylland United resembled a genuinely thrilling attacking force, with Memphis Depay humiliating Andr\u00e9 Romer to such an extent that the right-back\u2019s dismissal with a little over 10 minutes remaining was as much an act of mercy on the part of the referee as it was a punishment, and Marcus Rashford scoring twice on an unexpected and phenomenal debut. Season\u2019s low in Europe Failure to get out of an unexceptional Champions League group was galling, particularly the last-match defeat at Wolfsburg in which, according to Paul Scholes, they displayed \u201cno urgency, threat or quality\u201d, but worse was to follow. United were missing 13 players for the visit to Midtjylland, lost David de Gea in the warm-up \u2013 Van Gaal blamed \u201cthe law of Murphy\u201d \u2013 and blundered their way to a 2-1 defeat, the nadir of recent times. Manager\u2019s European record In September Louis van Gaal said he could win the Champions League with United either this season or next. When asked what made him so confident, he replied: \u201cBecause I did it everywhere.\u201d It is not quite true, but Van Gaal certainly has impressive experience: he has won seven league titles in four European countries and managed his way through 156 matches in continental competition, the equivalent of a little over four full Premier League seasons. His teams have been Champions League finalists on three occasions, even if two of those \u2013 including his one victory in that competition \u2013 as well as his single Uefa Cup success, came at Ajax more than two decades ago. This season has seen his first European experience for five years, though most of those were spent plotting Holland\u2019s path to the 2014 World Cup semi-finals. Players\u2019 Euro pedigree Of the 2008 Champions League winners only Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney remain, though Antonio Valencia and Chris Smalling were in the squad for United\u2019s most recent appearance in the final, in 2011. Juan Mata and Bastian Schweinsteiger both won the Champions League with previous clubs, while David de Gea has a Europa League winner\u2019s medal with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Reason to be cheerful Marcus Rashford\u2019s emergence has added a thrilling coda to an often underwhelming season. Reason to be fearful For much of the season it has appeared that Van Gaal has instructed his players not to attack with any coherence."
