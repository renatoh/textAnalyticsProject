Who are you voting for? Alison Croughwell, 28, from Salem, a farmer and student Voted for: Bernie Sanders \u201cI voted for Bernie - I think he\u2019d do a wonderful job. It\u2019s nice to know he has been a leader but he\u2019s also a person like us - he\u2019s not on the same pedestal as other candidates are.\u201d Do we need a revolution? \u201cYes, I think we have forgotten where we came from and Bernie reminds us of that. I think people my age can relate to Bernie. It\u2019s the first time at my school where I have heard a lot of kids talking about wanting to vote, and that made me excited.\u201d Jennifer McKenzie, 61, of Salem \u201cI voted for Hillary, I was undecided coming in but I thought she was probably the best candidate. I was really torn as there are not many promising candidates. But I think with the knowledge that she has Hillary can really do something. I was choosing between Hillary and Sanders but I wanted a woman. It\u2019s time for a woman.\u201d Tom Parsons, 68, a retired veteran from Salem \u201cI voted for Donald Trump, I think he\u2019ll bring the country back in the right direction and he\u2019s pro-veteran. I like three or four more of the current Republican field but I decided on Trump after the first debate. We\u2019ve had eight years of a lousy leader and we really need a shake-up.\u201d Here\u2019s the view from the polls: Who are you voting for? Gail Schuman, a 68-year-old widow from Manchester, New Hampshire Voted for: Hillary Clinton (decided \u201cafter the last debate\u201d) \u201cI don\u2019t think she and Bernie are as far apart as they pretend to be. Too bad they\u2019re not running together, as running mates ... I don\u2019t think they [younger voters] grasp the importance of experience. And she has so much experience.\u201d Curtis Page, a 44-year-old engineer from Manchester Voted for: Donald Trump (decided \u201ca long time ago\u201d) Does America need a revolution? Yes. \u201cI want no established politicians. I want a complete outsider. I like what he says about immigration.\u201d It\u2019s interesting how many of these voters react positively to the idea America needs a \u201crevolution\u201d \u2013 whether they support Sanders, Clinton, Trump, Cruz ... Perhaps Sanders\u2019s use of that word - much-derided by TV pundits when he first sprang it on them - was not such a big risk after all. Who are you voting for? Jim DiCarlo, a teacher from Exeter Voted for: Bernie Sanders Decided: \u201cabout a week ago\u201d Excited about a President Sanders on a scale of one to 10: 7 Excited about a President Clinton: 7 Does American need a revolution? \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s more that I like Hillary less than I like Senator Sanders. There\u2019s something about her I just don\u2019t like. I know I ought to, but you don\u2019t always get the whole story from her. Sure, I worry that Bernie can\u2019t get elected against one of the Republicans in November, but I\u2019ll vote for anybody that isn\u2019t one of them. I wish there was a third choice.\u201d Kathleen, 52, from Exeter Voted for: Ted Cruz. She decided late yesterday Excited about Cruz, on a scale 1-10: 7 Rest of field: \u201ccrazy\u201d Does American need a revolution? \u201cI did vote for him for a revolution, yes. I believe in his views and he showed this week that they\u2019re consistent.\u201d Who are you voting for? Carol Brewitt, of Exeter, was \u201cvery ticked off\u201d because a registration snafu had prevented her from casting a vote for her preferred candidate - \u201cHillary, of course.\u201d \u201cI love to travel, I love the world,\u201d she said. \u201c[Clinton is] very professional and she\u2019ll keep the country right in the eyes of the world ... She\u2019s a substantial woman with a brain and she can handle all of that.\u201d Diane Wright, 72, of Exeter decided to support Bernie Sanders when she walked into the polling station at the Tuck Learning Campus gym in Exeter. \u201cI love Hillary and I always wanted a woman president,\u201d Wright said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really trust her. She reminds me too much of Bill.\u201d Wright took an online questionnaire to match her views to the best candidate, and Sanders came out on top. \u201cHe seems to care about the people,\u201d Wright said. Bonnie Maney, a senior citizen of Exeter, said she had switched from Clinton to Sanders two weeks ago, when her daughter, who is in her early 30s, finally convinced her. \u201cEvery time I turned around, [my daughter] had another argument\u201d for Sanders, Maney said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know if she can even afford a house.\u201d Maney said she was impressed when she saw Clinton speak last November, but her daughter \u201cpretty much talked me out of it\u201d. Richard Pang, also of Exeter, voted for Jeb Bush. He gave Trump a mark of zero out of 10. \u201cHe talks a lot of nonsense.\u201d Pang had supported Marco Rubio until the last debate, on Saturday, when he thought Rubio stumbled - and Bush effectively attacked Trump. \u201cHe really drew the blood of Donald Trump,\u201d Pang said of Bush. Who are you voting for? Mark O\u2019Dowd, 55, from Manchester, NH Party: Democrat Voted for: Hillary Clinton Made up mind: over a month ago Opinion on Clinton on a scale of 1-10: 6 Should there be a revolution, like Bernie Sanders has suggested? \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know that it is going happen.\u201d Who are you voting for? Chris Comfort, 50, from Rochester, voted for Trump this morning. \u201cI really believe he can make America great again,\u201d said Comfort, a retired pharmacist. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s not owned by anyone and that\u2019s a big thing in politics today.\u201d Comfort said he also liked Bernie Sanders. \u201cHe is like Donald Trump in the fact that he\u2019s a man of principle. He doesn\u2019t waver,\u201d he said. \u201cMr Sanders has always been for what he believes in and I respect that.\u201d Comfort was relaxing in Mel Flanagan\u2019s Irish pub and restaurant. I was in there eating a beef stew. \u201cIf you want to see the value of a man look at his children,\u201d Comfort said of Trump. Comfort is quite taken with Ivanka Trump in particular. He described her as \u201cthe American Diana\u201d, referring to the deceased ex-wife of Prince Charles. \u201cShe\u2019s a class act.\u201d Who are you voting for? Names: Shane and Susie Stevens Age: 45 and 47 Party: Republican From: Rochester, New Hampshire Voted for: Both Trump When did you decide? Shane: \u201cI didn\u2019t really make up my mind until I stood in the box.\u201d Susie: \u201cThis morning.\u201d Why Trump? Shane: \u201cHe has really no reason to run for president. He\u2019s not corrupt he\u2019s just doing it to help the country.\u201d How excited are you about Trump, on a scale of 1 to 10? \u201c8.\u201d \u201c8.\u201d How excited for the rest of the GOP field? \u201c8.\u201d \u201c8.\u201d Do you think we need a revolution? Shane: \u201cYes. I do. There\u2019s too much corruption.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know at this point, writes Jeb Lund: nothing. Here\u2019s what everyone else knows: nothing. Hillary Clinton needs to win among people to win New Hampshire, but if Bernie Sanders does better among people he will prevail, especially considering his lead among people. This could really shape our understanding of how Clinton or Sanders do amongst people. Trump leads the Republican pack, but his voters still might not be real, which could be a problem for him, because that could mean that fewer people will vote for him than another person. That other person? He could be Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich or Jeb Bush. It\u2019s neck and neck between what could happen and another thing that could happen. Not knowing anything isn\u2019t going to stop 24-hour news from packing the day with the on-air nutritive equivalent of packing peanuts. MSNBC is, by far, the least intolerable of the big three cable networks, and even watching it for a few hours is enough to send you to an animal shelter full of rabies in a hamburger suit. John Heilemann and Mark Halperin are there to ad lib the sequel to their seminal book, Double Change: Game Down. You could turn the TV off and simulate the process of listening to them by saying: \u201cWhen it\u2019s warm out, you don\u2019t need to wear a sweater,\u201d then shoving a $5 bill down a whirring garbage disposal. If Michael Bloomberg decides to run for president, his campaign should be dragged into the street and shot merely for the fact that he pays this pair six figures, at a minimum. Rich people know how to fix things! Helming this cruise off the edge of the world are chair-warmer Mika Brzezinski and sometime legal representative of an abortion-doctor murderer Joe Scarborough, potentially the most luminous mind to ever talk loudly on the streets of Mossy Head, Florida. That he was never locked in a Port-O-Let at the Boggy Bayou Mullet Festival and dragged into a barren stretch of scrub oak in 1994 tarnishes Okaloosa County\u2019s legacy of being a place of good folk. For depth, they\u2019re periodically throwing it to Mike Barnicle, whose every good line should send you to Google just to make sure Mike Royko didn\u2019t say it first. This is programming that makes you yearn for a Jublia ad just to see a more human toenail fungus. Periodically leavening the broadcast are appearances by campaign strategists. Their candidates are doing very well! Their candidates\u2019 opponents are going to be in trouble, especially if they don\u2019t do well among people, unlike the candidates who are polling well among people. This outcome is going to surprise you, unless it doesn\u2019t, which you shouldn\u2019t have counted out, unless you should have expected it. This klatsch of well-fed vampires is being filmed in front of a restaurant of New Hampshire residents, in case you were wondering where the real meat is. If you held a mirror up to it, the only people you\u2019d see would be diners sitting behind a stack of empty, well-lit chairs. This is Paul Owen taking over the blog from a polling place in Salem, New Hampshire. The Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui files from Derry, New Hampshire, where Marco Rubio is attempting to contain the damage of a disastrous debate performance: In the wake of the last Republican presidential debate, Marco Rubio has found himself combating an emerging narrative that he is too scripted - if not incapable of straying from talking points. But the Florida senator on Tuesday showed a more personal side when approached by a New Hampshire voter plagued by a family history of cancer. It was meant to be a simple drive-by for Rubio, who visited multiple polling centers here as New Hampshire residents cast their votes for the first-in-the-nation primary. Standing outside a middle school, Rubio seamlessly worked his way through a group of volunteers and voters lined up on the sidewalk - shaking their hands and posing for pictures. It was there that Stephanie Tsepas, a registered independent of Derry, awaited an opportunity to press the senator on cancer research. Tsepas had met Rubio just a few nights earlier at a rally he held in the same school, but he was ushered away at the time without being able to offer her a response in full Reintroducing herself, Tsepas spoke of how her husband had been diagnosed with colon cancer as a teenager and now her 12-year-old son was found to have a precursor of the same disease. Rubio, to her surprise, remembered their previous encounter and this time engaged in a detailed - and deeply personal - conversation about cancer and its toll on society. \u201cMy dad had lung cancer,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe was 84. He smoked his whole life. It took him pretty quickly.\u201d There were also two aunts who died of pancreatic cancer, he added, and the diagnosis of his nephew with leukemia. \u201cHe\u2019s done well from it, but it\u2019s tough,\u201d Rubio said of his nephew, now 9 years old. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s something different. It\u2019s not just cancer, it\u2019s all the stuff that comes with it. It\u2019s the infections, it\u2019s the chemo, and it\u2019s tough to see in a little boy.\u201d The tale of Rubio\u2019s father is a staple on the campaign trail - the senator has long captivated crowds with the inspirational tale of his immigrant parents, who worked as a bartender and a maid to leave their children better off. But he has seldom opened up about his father\u2019s passing just two months before Rubio was elected to the US Senate in 2010. Rubio also discussed with Tsepas his support for more federal funding toward cancer research. Citing the initiative Barack Obama announced in last month\u2019s State of the Union, to be led by vice president Joe Biden, who lost his son Beau to cancer last year, Rubio said he would favor boosting investment in developing and expanding targeted cancer therapies. He also showed interest in the specific problems Tsepas was facing, ranging from where her son would be treated to whether a procedure to remove the boy\u2019s colon as a preventive measure would be covered by their insurance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re facing,\u201d Rubio said, placing his arm on her shoulder as he wrapped up the conversation. Tsepas said she walked away more impressed than she had been before. When attending Rubio\u2019s rally on Friday, she said, \u201cI felt like I was in one of his commercials.\u201d \u201cBut today, I loved the honesty. It was definitely more personal for him,\u201d Tsepas added. Although heading into the polls still undecided, she ultimately chose not to vote for Rubio moments later. It was not that the senator wasn\u2019t personable, she said, adding that it was a tough decision. In the end, Tsepas simply concluded she was seeking a candidate with more experience. \u201cI just don\u2019t think now is his time,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe in four years.\u201d Illustrator Sophie Yanow drove to West Lebanon and in New Hampshire to meet voters and sketch them \u2013 they told her who they voted for, and why: Who are you voting for? Andrew J Stollar Age: 74 Party: Republican Profession: Retired From: Exeter, New Hampshire Voting for: Donald Trump Made up his mind: This morning. Support for Trump, 1-10: 10 \u201cI like Trump\u2019s positions. I was going to vote for Carson on principles, and because he\u2019s more intellectual than Trump, but really I would vote for any of the Republican field except Bush. I\u2019m a solid conservative, and I really like Trump.\u201d \u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be a revolution in poltics, but there needs to be a revolution in Washington DC and for the distribution of power to come back to the states.\u201d The tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch was the first to close voting in the New Hampshire primary today, with all nine eligible residents having cast their ballots by 20 seconds past midnight. Counting the votes took just three minutes, continuing the town\u2019s tradition of being the first to report results, a title it has held since 1964. Ohio governor John Kasich was declared the Republican winner, beating Donald Trump by three votes to two, while Bernie Sanders won all four of the Democratic votes. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Comedy Central\u2019s attempt at a cure for our Jon Stewart-less late-night comedy doldrums, has tasked its \u201cforeign exchange producer\u201d - Bee is Canadian - with figuring out why Jeb(!) Bush has failed to catch fire with American voters. The answer: Bush is like milk. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to New Hampshire because we have questions for this question mark of a Jeb with an exclamation point. This candidate who should be winning, but instead is totally getting his ass handed to him by an oddly tinted compilation of psychiatric symptoms [Donald Trump] and by a man who seems like he would lecture a starving kitten on personal responsibility, and then deport that kitten and his family [Ted Cruz]. If Jeb were a drink, according to one supporter, he would be milk, because \u201cmilk is just a normal thing that wouldn\u2019t be fantastic if you could choose any drink, but it\u2019s a solid drink to have.\u201d Bush is currently in a tight race for second place in the New Hampshire primaries, with Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich all jostling for the single non-Trump ticket out of New Hampshire. Who would you vote for? Who are you voting for? Robert Goeman Age: 66 Party: Republican Profession: Retired three weeks ago From: Exeter, New Hampshire Voted for: Donald Trump Made up his mind: About a month ago Opinion on Donald Trump, scale 1-10: 9 Do we need a revolution? \u201cWell, yes and no. We need to find the person who will change the way things are done and I don\u2019t think there is anyone else who will be able to do that apart from Trump. We need an outsider to be able to achieve that.\u201d Like Taylor Swift, Ted Cruz\u2019s response to Donald Trump repeating the vulgar insult of a primary voter was to \u201cshake it off.\u201d Speaking briefly to reporters at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Cruz said that Trump\u2019s repetition of a criticism that labeled him \u201ca pussy\u201d was typical Trump behavior. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that he lost in Iowa and his response is to simply yell and insult and engage in profanity,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cMy approach is not respond in kind. From the beginning of campaign when he and others have chosen to insult, to go to the gutter I don\u2019t respond in kind.\u201d Cruz then pivoted to claim \u201ca vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Obamacare\u201d and to claim \u201cif you vote for Donald Trump, you vote for Bernie Sanders style socialized medicine.\u201d The Texas senator defeated Trump in the Iowa caucuses by a margin of 27.6% to 24.3%. The Democratic and/or Republican candidate selected by the town of Rochester has ultimately won the New Hampshire primary every election since 1972. (Apart from 1992. That year Rochester voted for Bill Clinton. Paul Tsongas ended up winning in New Hampshire.) So Rochester should serve as a good indicator of who will be crowned Premier of the Primaries this evening. And according to the twenty minutes I just spent at Rochester\u2019s Voting Ward 2, Donald Trump is going to win. And win big!! Christine Draper Age: 47 Party: Republican From: Rochester, New Hampshire Voting for: Jeb Bush Made up her mind: Last week Opinion on Donald Trump, scale of 1 -10: 4 \u201cI would have preferred to vote for Bernie Sanders, but I\u2019m a declared Republican so I couldn\u2019t.\u201d By the time Draper decided on Sanders it was too late to switch her affiliation. \u201cI knew what Bernie\u2019s message was \u2013 it was once I heard his plan to put it in place [that I decided I would have voted for him].\u201d \u201cI believe Donald Trump, when he spouts his stuff, he doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it the way it comes out. But that\u2019s not good.\u201d Do you think we need a revolution? \u201cI do, I absolutely do. I don\u2019t believe the political system as it is represents what the people want.\u201d Who are you voting for? Glenn Klink Age: 55 Party: Independent Profession: Unemployed, on disability From: Exeter, New Hampshire Voting for: Dr. Ben Carson, the \u201cmost reasonable, kind-hearted man in the field.\u201d Do we need a revolution? \u201cShould be, yeah - and what I tweeted out to all my independent friends is that if you\u2019re gonna vote Democrat, vote for Bernie ... Don\u2019t forget, you gotta vote ABC: anybody but Clinton. That woman cannot be trusted.\u201d Less than a month after Donald Trump began his improbable presidential campaign that has brought him to the cusp of victory in the New Hampshire primaries, the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs (a latter-day Cassandra who prefers to be known as a latter-day Jeremiah) pointed out that the \u201cloudmouth who has never spent a day in public office\u201d was resonating with voters in a way seldom seen before. Seven months later, his initial instincts about Trump\u2019s candidacy are eerily prescient: Donald Trump is a loudmouth who has never spent a day in public office. And that is why his supporters want him to be president. The controversial billionaire\u2019s rise in polls regarding the Republican field has been met by the chattering classes with a sense of shock and disgust. Trump has been tabloid fodder for decades, for a colorful personal life, a propensity foroutlandish statements and, of course, his hair. But as Republican candidates back away from him over his remarks about Mexico and immigrants, and corporate partners cut business ties, Trump has rocketed in the polls. The very qualities that earn the former host of The Celebrity Apprentice the scorn of media and political elites cause many everyday voters to embrace him. Presidential hopefuls from the Republican and the Democratic parties are making a final push in New Hampshire as voting begins in earnest in the state\u2019s \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d primary election. Hillary Clinton was joined by daughter Chelsea as she visited a polling station in Manchester on Tuesday morning, while Marco Rubio greeted supporters at another location in the same town. Who are you voting for? Christine Telge Age: 48 Party: Republican Profession: Works for a non-profit From: Manchester, New Hampshire Voting for: John Kasich Made up her mind: \u201cIn the last hour\u201d Support for Trump, 1-10: 8 Support for Rest of Field: 1 Telge was going to vote Democratic but read about alleged anti-police remarks by Bernie and changed her mind. \u201cI\u2019m in for mood for change and Hillary\u2019s part of the same problem: too many corporate dollars these days. I like the way Kasich\u2019s run his campaign. He\u2019s been positive and a breath of fresh air.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs reports from the most important diner in New Hampshire: The Red Arrow Diner in a Manchester institution, serving up coffee, bacon and burgers for decades. The result is that it has also become an absolute mob scene as presidential candidates flock for photo opportunities. The zoo-like atmosphere today has been amplified because Sirius radio is hosting a talk show here today with the result that candidates even more incentive to show up for a meet and greet. The Guardian showed up early to see senator Ted Cruz. However, the place was already packed because of the presence of fellow presidential candidate Ben Carson. To paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, the campaign to come in first out of all the losers is heating up. \u201cDemocracy in action!\u201d is more than just an empty aphorism muttered by shrugging cable news correspondents when confronted with evidence of how strange and poorly organized the electoral process is - it\u2019s also a real action! Reuters has a live video feed from a New Hampshire voting station, where Granite Staters are exercising their not-entirely-fair prerogative as citizens of the \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d primary state to select the likely presidential nominees for each party. (Hey, it\u2019s better than a smoke-filled room.) It\u2019s like \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d except Aaron Burr might have been a little disappointed. Opinion: Candidates avoid the aid in dying debate, but it\u2019s time to start talking about it Since physiological support like respirators and defibrillators made it possible to prolong life, prolonging death has fueled a more subtle conversation, writes Ann Neumann: Several factors have made politicians, particularly at the national level, reluctant to wade into the aid-in-dying conversation. Catholic leaders and their evangelical \u201cpro-life\u201d allies have eviscerated any politician willing to discuss aid in dying, shutting down dialogue and branding advocates as \u201cpro-death\u201d. By claiming to represent American religions, these vocal opponents have bifurcated the issue along political lines, all but silencing those who are religious but disagree. Yet a conversation is taking place, with or without the presidential candidates. Since the 1970s, when physiological support, like respirators and defibrillators, made it possible to prolong life, prolonging death has fueled a more subtle conversation about what medical decisions patients and their families can make. Aid in dying is now approved by 68% of Americans, a number that rose by a striking 10 points in the course of a year, according to a Gallup poll conducted in May 2015. It\u2019s now legal in five states with at least a dozen more considering bills or legislation. Still, the issue was absent from the presidential race until a terminal cancer patient finally asked a question last week. Jim Kinhan, an 81-year-old with a face as rosy as his sweater, asked Hillary Clinton at a New Hampshire town hall meeting on 3 February about her position on the legalization of aid in dying. \u201cI wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and \u2013 their end of life with dignity.\u201d His voice was raspy, his question respectful. The Washington Post reported that Clinton \u201clooked a bit nervous\u201d. After a slight pause and some careful word selection, Clinton failed to take a position. Who are you voting for? Dan Gaulin Age: 47 Party: Republican Profession: Beer vendor at the Verizon Center From: Bedford, New Hampshire Spotted at: Donald Trump rally in Manchester, Monday, 7.25pm Voting for: Donald Trump Made up his mind: \u201cA few days ago\u201d Support for Trump, 1-10: 8 Support for Rest of Field: 5-6 \u201cI\u2019m a vet, so what he\u2019s gonna try to do for us. And I like the idea of him getting out the illegal aliens now \u2013 we have to get ahead of the game. So, yeah.\u201d With voting already under way in the Granite State, months of polling is about to come to a head. Will months of common wisdom be upset by poor organization, as was the case in Iowa? Or will pollsters comfortably rest their heads tonight with visions of sugar plums chanting \u201cI told you so\u201d dancing in their heads? For Republicans, the New Hampshire primary is Donald Trump\u2019s to lose. The real estate tycoon has topped the Real Clear Politics polling averages in the state since he announced his candidacy in July. An average of the most recent polls in New Hampshire show Trump coasting with a vast 17-point lead over the nearest competition, Florida senator and Ex Machina sequel star Marco Rubio. The big question: whether his massive crowds can translate into actual voters. In Iowa, Trump walked into the caucuses with a wide lead in the most accurate state poll, but the campaign\u2019s ground game failed to deliver that support. Perhaps the bigger question is how closely the polls are going to reflect the hotly contested race for second place. New Hampshire, a state with a semi-deserved reputation for fostering the candidacies of relative moderates in both parties, has Rubio, Jeb Bush and Ohio governor John Kasich all within 2.5 points of each other - crowded in with Texas senator Ted Cruz. As for the Democrats, the question isn\u2019t whether Bernie Sanders is going to carry the state, but how vast his lead over Hillary Clinton will be. The RCP average has Sanders leading Clinton by more than 13 points, with some polls predicting as much as a 26-point blowout. Reporting from New Hampshire, the Guardian\u2019s DC bureau chief Dan Roberts asked a few young Granite State voters why they\u2019re supporting Bernie Sanders. The consensus: His progressivism seems legit. The son of Republican presidential candidate and real estate billionaire Donald Trump declared on Fox News last night that his father\u2019s endorsement of waterboarding is more than defensible, comparing the practice to \u201cwhat happens on college campuses in frant houses.\u201d \u201cYou see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings,\u201d said Eric Trump on Fox News\u2019s On the Record. \u201cYou see our cities getting shot up in California. You see Paris getting shot up.\u201d \u201cAnd then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded, which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses in frat houses everyday,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou know the man will keep this country safe.\u201d On Saturday, the elder Trump declared that he would \u201cbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\u201d, or simulated drowning, at the Republican debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. If the polls can\u2019t predict the election, maybe the planets can. \u201cWhoever does well in New Hampshire, it looks like this might be who is president in November,\u201d astrologer Christopher Renstrom said. Renstrom isn\u2019t #FeelingTheBern or the #Marcomentum. Instead, he\u2019s going off the alignment of the planets during the 2016 presidential campaign and comparing them to the alignment of planets when candidates were born to see who\u2019s got astrology in their favor. Last week in Iowa, polls pointed to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both galloping home with wins. However, Trump scraped by with second place and Clinton barely held on to beat Bernie Sanders by the tiniest of margins. So with all eyes on New Hampshire\u2019s primary on Tuesday night where Trump and Sanders are expected to win, Renstrom, a Salt Lake City-based astrologer who writes daily horoscopes, did the candidate\u2019s charts. Bernie Sanders was once a Democratic underdog who barely registered in the polls - now the senator has thousands of New Hampshire supporters buckled into his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d bandwagon leading up to a primary that could catapult him over Hillary Clinton. Dan Roberts reports from Manchester on how Sanders became a force to be reckoned with: If the revolution rolls on much longer, Bernie Sanders will no longer need to finish his speeches at all. He may simply be able to rely on the audience to supply the punchlines. \u201cWho is the biggest welfare recipient in America?\u201d he asked a rally in Rindge on Saturday. \u201cWalmart,\u201d they booed in unison, eagerly anticipating his now familiar critique of the retailer\u2019s low pay. \u201cWhat happened to the banks?\u201d he mused in Manchester two days later. \u201cThey stole the country, the assholes,\u201d shouted a voice from the crowd, with only minor embellishment of the intended homily on Wall Street greed. Though the content has changed little since he first challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party nomination in May last year, what began as a set of lectures full of rhetorical questions have evolved into call-and-response pantomime. But despite the angry message at these trademark rallies, young crowds and an anarchic music soundtrack have brought a carnival atmosphere to the campaign trail unlike that of any other candidate in 2016. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are on opposite ends of the political spectrum - well, unless you consider their stances on single-payer health care - but their supporters have some surprising similarities. Half of Trump\u2019s supporters say they are angry at Washington, and a third of Sanders\u2019 supporters agree. Meanwhile, 43% of Trump\u2019s supporters are registered Democrats who are fed up with the status quo. Can you tell the difference? Clinton\u2019s struggle with young women in spotlight as New Hampshire votes Hillary Clinton\u2019s struggle to attract young female voters as she aims for the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d is facing renewed scrutiny as she tried to make an impact in the New Hampshire primary. As voters started turning out on a snowy election day in New England, polls showed dwindling support for the former secretary of state among women of all ages, at the same time that a substantial share of young Democrats say they support Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The state is expected to hand him a decisive victory. Clinton\u2019s problems in galvanising young women were starkly exposed when a feminist icon and a female trailblazer made separate comments admonishingthem for flocking to Sanders. Gloria Steinem, the author and activist, told HBO\u2019s Bill Maher that women \u201cget more activist as they grow older. And when you\u2019re younger, you think: \u2018Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.\u2019\u201d Madeleine Albright, the country\u2019s first female secretary of state, told Clinton supporters: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hellfor women who don\u2019t help each other.\u201d Steinem apologized on her Facebook page while Clinton defended Albright\u2019s remark as \u201clight-hearted but very pointed\u201d. But the backlash underscored a generational rift among women and self-described feminists that the Clinton campaign has struggled to bridge. Donald Trump has an explanation for calling fellow presidential candidate and Iowa caucus victor Ted Cruz a \u201cpussy\u201d yesterday: Happy Primary Day! In a final push to reach voters as the polls opened on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton greeted volunteers at a polling station at Parker Varney School. A crowd of volunteers and some voters cheered as the motorcade swept in at around 6:45. They cheered, waved blue HRC signs and chanted \u201c603 for HRC!\u201d as she arrived and \u201cI believe that she will win!\u201d as she left. Clinton and Chelsea shook hands, posed for voters and thanked volunteers who she worked \u201cday and night for me\u201d. Non-pool reporters showed up and chaos kind of broke out. NBC stuck a mic in Clinton\u2019s face and got a few questions in. \u201cThis is a rest process and as I\u2019ve said over the past couple days, we\u2019re going to keep working literally until the last vote is cast and counted and we\u2019re going to go from there.\u201d Predictions for tonight? \u201cYou know, I just love the way New Hampshire does this. I like the way the people of New Hampshire take it so seriously. They focus in on the issues and they keep coming back ... I\u2019m just looking for a great Election Day. As many people who can turn out, express their opinions and you know be part of the process. And for me that a big part of the reason why it\u2019s so important.\u201d One volunteer told her: it\u2019s going to be a good day! She smiled: \u201cOh, this is so fun. So fun!\u201d Two men who met her in the cafe yesterday were there. One said he forgot to ask for her picture yesterday and he was jealous because his friend got a snap and he said it \u201cwent viral\u201d. \u201cYou went viral?\u201d Clinton asked the friend who got the photo yesterday. \u201cThat sounds like some kind of disease.\u201d They took the photo and she checked it on the camera. \u201cOh that turned out good.\u201d Speaking to a group of volunteers , she told them: \u201cIt\u2019s a great experience you learn about so many things an people.\u201d She shook everyone\u2019s hands and posed for photos with everyone who asked. Only one leery voter showed up not expecting the crowd. The whole stop took about 15 minutes. For your planning purposes, Clinton is expected to make up to three more similar visits this morning. This morning\u2019s woodcut from the New York Daily News, the second-most popular tabloid among Gotham\u2019s straphangers: The Clinton campaign, apparently unpreoccupied by the New Hampshire primary, is putting a few Hollywood celebrities on blast. Nick Nerrill, Clinton\u2019s traveling press secretary, declared that a news article questioning the relationship between the candidate\u2019s foundation and nations that benefitted from arms deals facilitated by the state department was a \u201cbaseless smear.\u201d Merrill, not one to sub-tweet, called out actors Susan Sarandon and Mark Ruffalo by name for sharing the article as \u201ca new low.\u201d Said celebrities are not taking this lying down (or maybe they are - it\u2019s Twitter, you can do it from bed). With the nine residents casting their votes by 20 seconds past midnight, a few tiny towns continue a New Hampshire tradition and gives candidates an early boost. Adam Gabbatt reports from North Hampton: John Kasich and Bernie Sanders received early boosts in New Hampshire early on Tuesday morning, when each was declared the primary winner in the tiny town of Dixville Notch. Nine people cast their votes in the northern New Hampshire town just after midnight. The voting was over by around 20 seconds past 12. When the votes were counted, around three minutes later, Ohio governor Kasich was declared the Republican winner, beating Donald Trump by three votes to two. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders won Dixville Notch by a landslide. He received four votes compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s zero. Dixville Notch has been known since 1964 as the first New Hampshire town to vote. It has become a tradition for nation\u2019s media to descend on the town to cover the results of the ballot. On the eve of the primary, Donald Trump repeated an offensive remark from a member of the crowd about Ted Cruz\u2019s position on waterboarding. Ben Jacobs reports from Manchester: Donald Trump used his final rally before Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire presidential primary to sling a litany of insults at his rivals, raising eyebrows when he repeated an offensive remark from a member in the crowd who shouted that Ted Cruz\u2019s position on waterboarding made him \u201ca pussy\u201d. As voters began to brave the New England snow, the echo from a rumbustious Trump rally was still rippling across the state. Voting began shortly after midnight in a handful of remote New Hampshire hamlets and was due to end at 8pm. If the polls are correct, in the Democratic race, senator Bernie Sanders, from neighbouring Vermont, is expected to comfortably hold off Hillary Clinton, while presidential ambitions hang in the balance for many in a crowded Republican field. Trump, who seeks to put a chastening defeat in Iowa behind him, is a clear favorite in what appears to be a Republican battle for second place. There is no evangelical wave here to lift the Iowa victor Ted Cruz and the so-called establishment candidates are struggling to break out. New Hampshire: It\u2019s home to America\u2019s first astronaut, its first potato and its first primary. Tonight\u2019s vote could determine the fate of this year\u2019s slew of presidential candidates, from Donald Trump\u2019s out-of-left-field campaign to Bernie Sanders\u2019 way-out-of-literal-left-field campaign. For the curious or confused, a quick explainer on the New Hampshire primary and what\u2019s at stake in the Granite State: Good morning, and happy first-in-the-nation primary! Mike Allen calls it \u201cone of the most romantic and consequential days in American politics,\u201d and although beleagured candidates, campaign staff, voters and members of the press may arch a skeptical eyebrow at that first adjective, there\u2019s no denying the consequence of today\u2019s vote in the Granite State. No Republican candidate has ever won the party\u2019s nomination without either winning Iowa or New Hampshire, and no Democratic candidate has done so since 1992. If there are three tickets out of Iowa, there\u2019s only one out of New Hampshire. That said, there\u2019s a little wiggle room for the candidates who don\u2019t make it into the winner\u2019s circle tonight. Most projections are anticipating a relatively early call for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and billionaire Donald Trump, but their margins of victory will tell us a lot more than pre-primary polling data: If Clinton or an one of the trio of Republicans vying for the \u201ccentrist\u201d label perform better than expected, the establishment g\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung may be thwarted. The Guardian\u2019s reporters and editors will be filing dispatches from across the Granite State today, and once polls close at 7pm, expect full-ish results to come in quickly around an hour later. Then we\u2019re on to South Carolina for the Republican caucuses, and Nevada, where Sanders and Clinton will each attempt to keep the dream alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
