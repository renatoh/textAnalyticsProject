On Tuesday police executed a warrant investigating the \u201calleged publishing of information classified as an official secret\u201d which they said had the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security. The warrant from an ACT magistrate gave police authority to search the home, computer and mobile phone of the News Corp Sunday titles\u2019 political editor. The raid prompted outrage from News Corp Australia, which labelled it a \u201cdangerous act of intimidation\u201d targeted at public interest reporting. In April 2018 Smethurst reported that the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries had discussed draconian new powers to allow the Australian Signals Directorate to spy on Australian citizens for the first time. Under the mooted plan, spies would be allowed to secretly access emails, bank accounts and text messages with approval from the defence and home affairs ministers. Under current laws the Australian federal police and domestic spy agency Asio have the power to investigate Australians with a warrant and seek technical advice from ASD, which is not permitted to produce intelligence on Australians. In a statement the AFP confirmed it had executed a search warrant at a residence in an ACT suburb on Tuesday. \u201cThe matter relates to an investigation into the alleged unauthorised disclosure of national security information that was referred to the AFP,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThis warrant relates to the alleged publishing of information classified as an official secret, which is an extremely serious matter that has the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security. \u201cNo arrests are expected today as a result of this activity.\u201d In a statement News Corp Australia described the raid as \u201coutrageous and heavy-handed\u201d. \u201cThe Australian public\u2019s right to know information about government laws that could impact their lives is of fundamental importance in our society,\u201d it said. \u201cThis raid demonstrates a dangerous act of intimidation towards those committed to telling uncomfortable truths.\u201d News Corp Australia said it had \u201cexpressed the most serious concerns\u201d about erosion of the Australian public\u2019s right to know about government decisions that \u201ccan and will impact ordinary Australian citizens\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone on this morning sends clear and dangerous signals to journalists and newsrooms across Australia. This will chill public interest reporting.\u201d Digital Rights Watch chairman, Tim Singleton Norton, said it was \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d to see a raid investigating a public interest issue of \u201cpotential massive expansion of domestic capacity in Australian spy agencies\u201d. \u201cWe fear that the powers given to the AFP to seize and search Annika Smethurst\u2019s digital footprint represent a considerable risk to bold Australians who choose to expose wrongdoing in the public services,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a gross abuse of national security powers \u2013 using them to reinforce a culture of secrecy and lack of accountability in our law enforcement apparatus.\u201d Australian law prohibits unauthorised disclosure of information by commonwealth officers, an offence which gives police powers to investigate leaks informing public interest journalism. Australia also has offences which make it unlawful for non-commonwealth officers to communicate or deal with information that has a security classification of secret or top secret or \u201cdamages the security or defence of Australia\u201d. Journalists have a defence of dealing with protected information where they \u201creasonably believe\u201d it is in the public interest to do so, but the media union has warned the law still effectively criminalises journalism. Police have conducted raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network, Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs, and foreign targets of Australia\u2019s spying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
