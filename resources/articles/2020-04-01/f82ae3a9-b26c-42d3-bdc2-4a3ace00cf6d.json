This time, it involved De Blasio\u2019s announcement on Saturday morning that New York City\u2019s school district, which oversees 1.1 million students, would shutter for the rest of the academic year to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. De Blasio said his administration was forging a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to safely reopen schools in September and that \u201cnext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had\u201d. De Blasio, like Cuomo a Democrat, said it was not an easy decision to close schools in favor of online learning, but that \u201cit is the right decision, and it\u2019s also a decision made a little clearer by the fact that the distance learning is working more and more every day\u201d. However, at Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing shortly afterwards, the governor insisted \u201cthere has been no decision on [closing New York City] schools\u201d and that the decision whether or not to close schools is \u201cis my legal authority in this situation\u201d. Cuomo added: \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region. Any decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d Cuomo was then pressed on the topic and De Blasio\u2019s earlier remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester [counties].\u201d Adding to the confusion, an email from the city to parents was issued while Cuomo spoke, advising of the extended school closing. \u201cNYC school students will continue with remote learning for the rest of the 2019-20 school year,\u201d it said. Freddi Goldstein, De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, took issue with Cuomo\u2019s comments. She tweeted: \u201cThe governor\u2019s reaction to us keeping schools closed is reminiscent of how he reacted when the Mayor called for a shelter in place. We were right then and we\u2019re right now. Schools will remain closed, just like how we eventually \u2013 days later \u2013 moved to a shelter in place model.\u201d Goldstein\u2019s tweet alluded to that fact that Saturday\u2019s dispute was the latest bout in a long-running grudge match between the two elected officials. When De Blasio said last month New York City residents should prepare for a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d order, Cuomo said the city didn\u2019t have the power to make such a declaration. Days later, Cuomo announced a \u201cNew York state on pause\u201d order, directing non-essential businesses to close and telling people to stay 6ft away from others in public. The order sounded much like shelter-in-place, a term De Blasio has continued to use. School buildings in New York City, the center of the pandemic in the US, have been closed since 16 March. All school buildings in the state have been closed since 18 March following an executive order from Cuomo. The school closures were initially announced for a few weeks, back when the virus\u2019s full impact was not known. A massive effort to move school instruction online has met with mixed success in the city, where many low-income students lack wifi and devices for connecting to their virtual classrooms. Cuomo, whose national profile has risen during the pandemic, said again on Saturday he is not interested in running for president. When a reporter said some Democrats would prefer Cuomo to former vice president Joe Biden as their party\u2019s presidential nominee, Cuomo said: \u201cThat is on one hand flattering. On the other hand, it is irrelevant.\u201d \u201cI have no political agenda. Period,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not running for president. I\u2019m not running for vice president. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019m staying right here.\u201d \u2022 The caption to the picture was amended on 14 April 2020 because an earlier version said Andrew Cuomo was on the right. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
