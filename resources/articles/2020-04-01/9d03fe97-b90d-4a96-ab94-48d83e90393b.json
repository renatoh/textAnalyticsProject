Prof Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty Epidemiology, told the ABC\u2019s Q+A program on Monday she was concerned there was \u201cdogma out there\u201d that a vaccine for the virus could be found within a year to 18 months. McVernon said there were \u201cno certainties here\u201d and while she hoped a vaccine could be found \u201cit isn\u2019t a guarantee\u201d. She said: \u201cThat\u2019s why this needs to be a much more nuanced discussion about how we learn to live with this new virus, how we adapt to it over time, how we mitigate its risks and harms, how we keep looking for new therapies and other treatments that might reduce the death toll \u2026 and hoping for a vaccine, but being aware it may not come. That is important.\u201d In a discussion about \u201cherd immunity\u201d, McVernon said a \u201clet it rip\u201d strategy that some have advocated for was \u201cclearly not going to be our policy\u201d in Australia. But she explained while herd immunity was a way to achieve a long-term level of protection in society either by vaccine or by infection, \u201cwe don\u2019t know whether a single exposure to [Covid-19] is enough to be in the clear forever\u201d. She said: \u201cI think we need to understand much more about the biology of the virus before we would feel that was a safe outcome, even given the undesirable path to getting there.\u201d She called for a \u201cmore nuanced\u201d discussion about the way Australia and the world may have to live with the virus if a vaccine couldn\u2019t be developed quickly. In a seperate discussion, just hours before the program went to air, reports emerged that Virgin Australia was about to go into administration, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Sally McManus, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, asked why governments could not buy a stake in the airline to help secure the jobs and then sell the equity at a later date. She said even though governments have always said they should not be \u201cin the business of picking winners\u201d, the pandemic was \u201ca good reason to suspend these normal orthodoxies\u201d. \u201c[Governments] don\u2019t want to interfere in the market. But the market has stopped. It\u2019s been shut. All the airlines have had to be grounded, not because of some market failure or business decisions, it\u2019s been because of the pandemic.\u201d Neville Power, chairman of the government\u2019s advisory group the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, said Australia needed to \u201cmake sure that we have two competitive airlines\u201d. He said while the commission did have a role to play, it was too early to say what the best approach would be. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work going on behind the scenes to understand the issues, the specific issues that are facing Virgin and for that matter all the airlines, and to work out what\u2019s the best approach to that. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget Virgin has some very powerful major shareholders that can also be contributing to this. It\u2019s not just down to government. \u201cAnd I think under the right conditions, then Virgin can be maintained and kept as a second airline in Australia. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully played out yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
