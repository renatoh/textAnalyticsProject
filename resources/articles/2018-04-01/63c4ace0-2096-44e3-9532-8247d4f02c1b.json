Come a survey like last week\u2019s PEP report on the extent of race prejudice, and another such wave looks like jogging the Government into introducing legislation dealing with housing and employment. We tend to assume that the problem of the immigrant community is solving itself. Which, of course, it is not. For what is disquieting about the PEP report is not so much the present extent of discrimination in housing and jobs which it reveals. More disturbing is the survey\u2019s evidence that the sons and daughters of immigrants, born and educated in this country, experience as much discrimination as their parents \u2013 and to the extent that their qualifications and expectations are higher, suffer even more bitterly. So it is no use hoping that time will of itself do the trick of getting rid of prejudice and discrimination. It plainly won\u2019t. Nor will damming the remaining trickle of immigrants remove the problem. It was obviously right to limit entry. But the justification for these restrictions was that they gave us a better opportunity of helping those immigrants who were already here. So far, we have not done so. Can we do any better?
