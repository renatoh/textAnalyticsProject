The \u201cgodfather of punk\u201d, delivering the fourth annual John Peel lecture at the Radio Festival in Salford on Monday, said the music industry was now \u201claughably, maybe, almost entirely pirate\u201d and said electronic devices had \u201cestranged people from their morals, making it easier to steal music than to pay for it\u201d. But he reserved some of his toughest criticism for Irish band U2, who prompted howls of protest when they gave away their latest album as a free download for iTunes users as part of Apple\u2019s launch of its new iPhones and Apple watch. \u201cThe people who don\u2019t want the free U2 download are trying to say, \u2018Don\u2019t try to force me,\u2019 and they\u2019ve got a point,\u201d said Pop at the event, hosted by 6 Music\u2019s Lauren Laverne, on Monday night. \u201cPart of the process when you buy something from an artist, it\u2019s kind of an anointing, you are giving that person love. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only point, these are not bad guys. But now everybody is a bootlegger and not so cute as before and there are people out there just stealing stuff and saying, \u2018Don\u2019t try to force me to pay,\u2019 and that act of thieving will become a habit, and that\u2019s bad for everybody.\u201d He said musicians who had previously suffered at the hands of record labels and executives who had taken all the profits were now being penalised by the digitally empowered public. \u201cWe are exchanging the corporate rip-off for the public one, aided by power nerds, kind of \u2018computer Putins\u2019. They just want to get rich and powerful. \u201cNow the biggest bands are charging insane ticket prices or giving away music before it can flop in an effort to stay huge and there is something in this huge thing that kind of sucks.\u201d Reflecting on his own career, the former Stooges lead singer said that if he had to get by on the proceeds from his record sales, \u201cI would be tending bars between sets\u201d. But despite his criticism of music pirates \u2013 \u201cThere are varying definitions of theft, but I know a conman when I see one\u201d \u2013 he appeared to have some sympathy for people who face tough sanctions when they are convicted of illegally downloading or filesharing. \u201cIs the thieving that big a deal? Ethically, yes, and it destroys people because it is a bad road you take,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a general atmosphere [in the music business] of resentment, pressure, kind of strange perpetual war, and I think prosecuting some college kid because she or he shared a file is a lot like sending somebody to Australia a couple of hundred years ago for poaching his lordship\u2019s rabbit. That\u2019s how it must seem to poor people who just want to watch a crappy movie for free.\u201d Pop also defended the car insurance adverts in which he has appeared, for which he has been accused of selling out. \u201cAt least I\u2019m honest,\u201d he told the audience of industry executives. \u201cIt\u2019s an ad, and that\u2019s all it is.\u201d He said the music industry was a \u201cpond that is wide, but very shallow. Nobody cares about anything too deeply except money. Running out of it and getting it.\u201d Pop, who presents a show on the BBC\u2019s digital music station, 6 Music, got his biggest laugh by advising his audience to \u201cstay away from drugs \u2026 and [TV] talent judges\u201d. But he also urged on his audience the importance of a musical education and the value of learning an instrument. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a kid and you can trick them into playing the French horn for a year, that is a good thing.\u201d He said it was a \u201cdream job\u201d to be a musician, to \u201cmake people feel something and then trust in God. While you are waiting for god to show up, try to find a good entertainment lawyer.\u201d Separately, Pop praised the Guardian, which he said was set up to \u201ccreate a voice for the little guy\u201d. He said: \u201cThey have a moral mission or imperative that has given them the latitude to be interesting, thoughtful, helpful, and they bring Edward Snowden to the world stage, something that was not pleasant for a lot of people to hear about, but maybe you need to know.\u201d Pop also had praise for Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, who he said was \u201cencouraging positive change\u201d, and for Peter Gabriel, for his work promoting world music with Womad. He was similarly positive about Vice Media and Virgin Records founder Richard Branson. In a question and answer session after the speech, he also revealed an unlikely fondness for BBC1\u2019s rural affairs show, Countryfile, and a sequence in which a sound recordist went into the woods to record birdsong. The singer\u2019s lecture, called \u201cfree music in a capitalist society\u201d, was broadcast live on 6 Music and will be repeated by BBC4 on Sunday. It marked the 10-year aniversary of the death of Peel, who was the first DJ to play the Stooges on UK radio. \u201cI worked half of my life for free,\u201d said Pop. \u201cThe masters of the record industry kept complaining that I wasn\u2019t making them any money. When it comes to art, money is an unimportant detail. It just happens to be a huge unimportant detail.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
