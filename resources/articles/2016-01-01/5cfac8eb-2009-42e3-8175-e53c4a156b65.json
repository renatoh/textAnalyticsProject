However, the result was quickly forgotten afterwards as a clearly shaken and furious Mancini told Rai TV about the exchange he had with the Napoli manager on the touchline. \u201cThe confrontation on the touchline? You have to ask Sarri about that, he is a racist. People like him do not belong in football. He used racist words. I stood up to ask about the five minutes being added on and Sarri shouted \u2018poof\u2019 and \u2018faggot\u2019 at me. I would be proud to be that if he is what\u2019s considered a man.\u201d \u201cPeople like him should not be in football. He is 60 years old. The fourth official heard but didn\u2019t say anything. He came to see me in the changing room to apologise but he should really be ashamed of himself.\u201d Mancini was sent off towards the end of the game for remonstrating with the Napoli bench. Mancini did not see the second goal as he became involved in the heated exchange with the fourth official and then Sarri, and was ordered from the touchline. The row began after the fourth official mistakenly indicated nine minutes of added time before changing his mind and showing five instead. All Sarri had to say of the incident was \u201cthat he could not remember\u201d what he said to Mancini and that \u201cwhat is said on the pitch should stay on the pitch\u201d. Sarri is no stranger to controversy. Last year while still in charge of Empoli, he was fined \u20ac5,000 after a match against Varese after making a rude gesture towards fans but escaped punishment for making similar comments. \u201cFootball has become a sport for fags,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cWe suffered twice as many fouls, but we had more yellow cards. It\u2019s a contact sport in Italy and but the whistle is blown a lot more than in England because of the interpretation by homosexuals.\u201d Inter, third in the league, will face the winner of Wednesday\u2019s match between Lazio and Juventus in the semi-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
