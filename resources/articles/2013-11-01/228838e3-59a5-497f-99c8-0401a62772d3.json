He's enjoying himself. We all did. Apart from Nadal. Anyway, that was the tennis year that was. Djokovic ends it as the king. Just the 22 wins in a row for him. Bye! There is to be drama. Nadal intends to make this as difficult as possible but his hands aren't complying with his brain. He drifts a slice wide to make it 15-0 and Djokovic then produces a forehand winner for 30-0. He's two points away. Two little points. Two eensy-weensy points. But Nadal intends to make this as difficult as possible. He sees Djokovic coming to the net, a little lazily, and passes him effortlessly on the forehand side. 30-15. And, suddenly, Nadal's got his mojo back, marauding forward, taking the initiative and putting away a backhand volley to make it 30-all. The stones on Djokovic, though. A horrible serve leaves Nadal in knots and he has a second championship point. A rally ensues. Djokovic is on the attack. He tries a drop-shot. He should know better. Deuce, second championship point frittered away, just like that. But an ace gives him a third. He roars. He bounces the ball. He misses a first serve. He gets the second in. Nadal attacks, his forehands regaining their menace. But Djokovic hangs on - and then it happens, Nadal whips one last forehand wide and the title is Djokovic's! He reigns again in London! Second set: Nadal* 3-6, 4-5 Djokovic (*denotes server): A tired forehand into the net from Nadal to make it 15-all perhaps hints that his challenge is fading - so does another to make it 15-30. Djokovic is two points away from victory. Two points. Two little points. Two eensy-weensy points. He nets a backhand return to make it 30-all, but brings up a championship point as a scrambling Nadal dribbles a backhand into the net. What's Nadal got left? Enough to delay Djokovic's coronation, it turns out, pounding groundstrokes bringing it back to deuce. Nadal then allows himself a fist pump as he wins the next point and then the game with a free-wheeling forehand winner. Djokovic remains one game away. But he'll serve for the title now. Is there to be drama? Second set: Nadal 3-6, 3-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server): So, still work for Djokovic to do, then. But he doesn't look like he's about to grumble and a sliced backhand from Nadal drifts wide to make it 30-0. Nadal then fails to punish a forehand enough so Djokovic puts the hurt on him with a vicious cross-court backhand for 40-0. Nadal gets it back to 40-15 but then Djokovic sends a second serve down the middle that kicks, loops, sits up and causes all sorts of problems for Nadal. Dearie me. Djokovic is a game away. Second set: Nadal* 3-6, 3-4 Djokovic (*denotes server): Djokovic is reaching a scary level. At 15-all, he produces a point that is just far too good for Nadal, rapping backhand after backhand cross-court until Nadal gives in. 15-30 and Nadal's shoulders are starting to sag a little. Not often you can say that. He tries to cling on but Djokovic is getting better and better as the match progresses, his groundstrokes so precise and his touch at the net exquisite - a lovely forehand volley brings up two break points. But two big first serves get Nadal out of a hole - he'll not be going away without a fight. Instead, we go to deuce, and Djokovic whacks a forehand wide to give Nadal the hold. You have to admire the Spaniard's unrivalled levels of stubborngittitude.\"Do you reckon the surface negates some of Rafa's topspin?\" says Jon Horsley. \"Or is he not getting the whip on his forehand just so?\" He doesn't especially like playing indoors and the speed of the court suits Djokovic more. What's more, Djokovic's ability to reach Nadal's best shots is forcing errors. Second set: Nadal 3-6, 2-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Ace. 15-0. And then more preposterousness from Djokovic, tempting Nadal into attempting the pass down the line, and just touching a backhand volley back into the space vacated by the Spaniard. An ace then makes it 40-0, though he's hauled back to 40-30. Suddenly the crowd wakes up. They want to see a fight, not a demolition and they're getting the latter at the moment. Djokovic, though, isn't about to indulge them - a smash seals the game. He needs two more to retain his title. Second set: Nadal* 3-6, 2-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): This is a must-win game for Nadal. Two breaks would surely be too much, especially with his forehand misfiring. Just as well that Djokovic offers up a few errors to make it 40-0. A neat volley from Djokovic makes it 40-15 but Nadal keeps him at arm's length, a forehand landing inches past the baseline. Second set: Nadal 3-6, 1-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): We wait for the start of the fourth game of the second set as fans take their seats, walking slowly through the aisles in order not to spill any refreshments - wouldn't want to cause any aggro at the tennis. Once everyone's settled down with their booze, Djokovic holds to love, Nadal going for the lines too much and missing too much. Second set: Nadal* 3-6, 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Djokovic looks likes he's doing yoga when he's playing. He's so very elastic. And his ability to reach Nadal's boomers is troubling the Spaniard. It's forcing him to put too much on his shots - three bad forehands, two wide and one long gives Djokovic three break points. This is a pivotal moment in the match. No doubt about that. But Djokovic can't take the first two, slicing into the net and then sending a backhand wide. 30-40 and Nadal has hope again, not that he can relax yet. Djokovic is still on the prowl and soon he's letting out a primal roar, a splendid forehand return enough to force Nadal into the error. Djokovic breaks. It's his to lose now, though no one should be stupid enough to write off a Nadal comeback. Second set: Nadal 3-6, 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic misses a forehand by inches to give Nadal a 0-15 lead, but he's soon up 30-15. The margins are so small. Djokovic then achieves a fine length on a cross-court forehand, hitting it on the run, and Nadal knocks a backhand into the net to make it 40-15, looking back in disgust. He's a bit frustrated with himself, even more so after hitting a forehand return long. Second set: Nadal* 3-6, 1-0 Djokovic (*denotes server): Rafa's uncle and former Barcelona defender, Miguel Angel Nadal, is in the crowd and he'll not like what he's seeing, two more unforced errors from his nephew giving Djokovic a look at 0-30. But Nadal's not the world No1 for nothing and he's soon up 40-30, playing aggressively and digging deep. He holds and allows himself a congratulatory \"Come on!\" \"This is magnificent,\" trills Simon McMahon. \"I'm looking forward to 2014 already. Nadal and Djokovic joined by a (hopefully) fully fit Murray, Del Potro looking strong again, Berdych and Wawrinka trying to make a breakthrough in the Slams, not to mention Federer desperate to go out on a high. Oh, and a World Cup, Ryder Cup and Winter Olympics. Ice tennis, anyone?\" I join this game at 15-all and more shenanigans at the net. Nadal drop-shots, Djokovic tries another lob, but Nadal's not having it this time - his overhead backhand volley is judged to perfection. 15-30. Djokovic looks a bit nervous. He plays a shade too far within the lines and eventually finds himself in no-man's land, only for a hopeful backhand to clip the top of the net and leave Nadal stranded. 30-all. Nadal then nets a forehand to give Djokovic a set point. Not a bad time to come up with a thumping ace out wide. That was a sensational end to the set. More please! More! First set: Nadal* 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes server): The new balls were asked for politely, so are now in play, which might favour Djokovic at this crucial stage. Might. Who knows. Only one way to find out, no point me speculating in cyberspace, is there. Nadal enjoys a 15-0 lead; he does not enjoy a double-fault to make it 15-all. Djokovic nets a forehand - 30-15. Nadal nets a forehand - 30-all. The wrong kind of imitation, really. Then, Nadal yawns a forehand into the net to give Djokovic a break point, only for a big serve down the middle to extract him from a perilous situation. Deuce. And then advantage Djokovic after another double-fault from Nadal. This is weird. And this is preposterous! Outrageous! Superlatives! Nadal charges to the net to put away what he thinks is a perfect volley into the corner - but it's not quite got enough on it and Djokovic not only reaches it but lobs him! Nadal scampers back and then the two absurderise at the net, Djokovic eventually coming out on top, spotting the gap and sending a forehand into it. He'll serve for the first set. First set: Nadal 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A cracking response from Djokovic to losing three games on the bounce, as he races into a 40-0 lead. Nadal then gives him something to think about though, crunching a forehand return past him to make it 40-15, but he's not allowed any closer than that by Djokovic. You wouldn't want to be tasked with calling which way this is going to go. First set: Nadal* 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Djokovic relocates his range on the first point, a whistling cross-court backhand too good for Nadal, but two misses then make it 30-15. The quality isn't as high as it could be but neither man is giving an inch now - there's barely anything to separate them. Djokovic then misses a backhand to make it 40-15, before complaining to the umpire about someone using a flash in the crowd. If you are the person doing that, you are an incompetent, disrespectful buffoon who has no business attending this final. First set: Nadal 2-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic needs to make sure the disappointment of not breaking again doesn't affect him adversely and he could probably do without losing the first point of this game, his approach to the net read by Nadal, whose forehand pass is too good. 0-15. Djokovic responds with a rasping forehand, but then swerves one wide to make it 15-30, a few errors creeping into his game. As Jose Mourinho might put it, I have a smell - and a dreadful backhand from Djokovic gives Nadal two break points. Djokovic saves the first, Nadal not doing enough with a second serve, and a teasing serve out wide saves the second. But he'll need to save a third, a forehand flapped into the net. Nadal's eyes narrow and his frown deepens. He's got a smell too and rightly so - a clever slice unsettles Djokovic and his timing is off as he stoops to waft a backhand miles long. We're back on serve. Could be here a while. First set: Nadal* 1-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Jack Wilshere's at the tennis, a just reward for yesterday's defeat at Manchester United. Remember, the O2 arena is a non-smoking venue. Back on court after a wee sit-down, Nadal finds himself in a 30-0 lead after two Djokovic errors, though a double-fault follows, and then a mishit backhand. 30-all. Djokovic remains on top, Nadal struggling to find his range. He's not got going at all and a second double-fault to give Djokovic a break point confirms that. Lose this one and the first set is all but over. Djokovic is forced on the defensive at first, Nadal battering his forehands into the corners, but just as he appears to have gained the upper hand, he shanks a backhand wide, causing him to let out a cry of anguish. That's all the encouragement Nadal needs to hold. What an escape for the world No1. But he won't care - he's on the board. First set: Nadal 0-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Goodness me. At 15-all, Djokovic surprises everyone with a delicious serve-volley routine - and though Nadal's return from the wide serve is awkward to deal with, Djokovic's volley at the net is a sight to behold. 30-15.Nadal, a little nervy still, then grunts a forehandlong, before Djokovic does the same for 40-30. Hope for Nadal but he misses a forehand and Djokovic consolidates the break. \"Evening Jacob,\" says a suitably formal Simon McMahon. \"I reckon Nadal's a bit of a country boy at heart. Gram Parsons or Willie Nelson. Djokovic is more of a Mick Jagger rock star type.\" First set: Nadal* 0-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Talk is that the faster surface indoors will suit Djokovic more. Nadal, of course, has never won this title. Djokovic is the champion. The man - and he takes the first point, Nadal off-balance and tamely finding the net with a backhand. Then, more admonishment for the crowd, someone in the front row fiddling with the flash on a camera. Eventually the crowd cheers - presumably said individual has had his phone confiscated. He can have it back at the end of the lesson, if he asks nicely. Back on court, Nadal is in trouble already, down 0-30 in no time at all. Djokovic is dictating the points, Nadal struggling to get any proper length on his groundstrokes. Sure enough, a piercing forehand sees Nadal whump one wide, giving Djokovic three break points. Nadal saves the first magnificently, reading a drop shot from Djokovic, racing to the net and flicking a wonderful shot past him. But there are still two break points to save - and Djokovic is in the mood. He wrong-foots Nadal with a change of direction and the Spaniard can only block a defensive shot into the net. Advantage Djokovic. First set: Nadal 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): And finally, we have tennis. The two men jog out on to the court, the shouts of \"Come on, Rafa!\" from the crowd highly audible. But Djokovic won't let that affect him and he gets down to business straight away, clinically putting away a forehand down the line to win the first point. The next point lasts rather longer, Nadal grunting and scurrying, Djokovic eventually knocking a backhand long to make it 15-all. But a terrific, curling serve out wide makes it 30-15 - before the next point, the umpire tells off someone in the crowd for arriving late. Honestly, did he really have somewhere else to be? Luckily he's in place to see Djokovic romp forward and punch a forehand volley into the wide open spaces left by Nadal. 40-15. And then an ace. That was good. They're still knocking up. The music's still playing, just to get the crowd in the mood for some top-class tennis. One of the things they do at the O2 is flash up ACE! on the big screen when someone does an ace, just to make sure everyone knows. It's a bit like going bowling. Except you're not allowed to talk or use flash photography. Tok! Tok! Tok! They're knocking up. Time for the toss. Naturally Nadal makes Djokovic wait, just because. The umpire then runs through the rules, just because. And then Djokovic calls heads ... and it's heads! Djokovic chooses to serve and then it's time to smile for the cameras. Say cheese, lads. Nadal is in a light blue t-shirt and white shorts. Djokovic settles for his Uniqlo best, an all-black number. Or maybe it's navy. Here comes Djokovic, walking out to some chart filler. He takes the hand of a Barclays Child, as the lights sparkle and twinkle. Then it's Nadal's turn, the Spaniard striding out of the smoke as if he's about to do a turn on Stars in Their Eyes. I wonder what act he'd mimic, actually. Does it matter playing Djokovic for a 39th time? He puts on his best poker face and speaks. \"Everything is different. Different conditions and different moments. We will see. We know each other well. But everything can change. Would winning this title mean much to him? \"A lot, of course, it's a final,\" he deadpans. \"Against Nadal, it is always a huge challenge.\" I feel better for hearing that. Pictures! Get your hot spicy pictures here! It's 8pm! The Doubles final is over, David Marrero &amp; Fernando Verdasco beating the Bryans brothers 7-5, 6-7, 10-7. Rafa and Novak are up next. And so it ends here, on a cold November evening by the Thames. After 11 months and four grand slams, the 2013 tennis season reaches its final stop, London's Millenium Dome O2 Arena, and how fitting that the finale should feature the two best players in the world, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, duking it out in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals, two months after they duked it out in the final of the US Open (Nadal won) and five months after they duked it out in the semi-final of the French Open (Nadal won). They've duked off a lot this year and they'll be duking off soon enough next year as well, injuries permitting. After all, the Australian Open starts in a couple of months. Get ready for some tennis! But are we bored with it? No, we are not bored with it, nor are we bored of it or by it. Because, and there can be no arguments about this, even from Andy Murray, the stats don't lie, these two are the best in the world, Nadal confirmed as the year-end No1 and Djokovic not too far behind in No2, winning three of the four slams between them. Murray, you might remember, took the other at Wimbledon and lost in the Australian Open final to Djokovic, but his back injury did for his US Open title defence and means he missed this tournament. He hasn't played a match since September. In any case, he's only got two slams to Nadal's 13 - watch out, Roger - and to Djokovic's seven, so he's got a fair bit of catching up to do once he returns to the court. At least Murray can take some encouragement from Nadal's own mini-revival. A year ago, he was the one who was forced to sit and watch as he recovered from the knee injury that forced him to take a seven-month break and led to whispers that the great man's time in the game might be nearing its end. Predictions, eh? That madcap evening in the summer of 2012 against Lukas Rosol feels like a long time ago now. Since his comeback, Nadal has been astonishing; tonight he is after his 11th title in 14 finals this year and has won 75 of 81 matches. Not bad. Not bad at all, especially given how bleak it looked when he lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Steve Darcis. But now we're back to discussing whether or not he's better than Roger Federer, who he beat in straight sets yesterday. For what it's worth, here's what he had to say: \"It will be very difficult for anyone to improve his numbers. I never saw Rod Laver play but I know his history. He was away for a few years because he became a professional but he was able to win all four [majors] before and all four after. Today the question is not about me or Roger, more about Rod Laver or Roger. When I finish my career, we'll see where I am in the history of tennis.\" High on the list, I'll be bound. As for Djokovic, he was in the mood against Stanislas Wawrinka last night, winning their semi-final with consummate ease. He hasn't lost a match and has beaten Federer and Juan Martin del Potro along the way and was also victorious the last time he met Nadal, triumphing in the final of the China Open last month. The Elastic Man is also the defending champion here - he won a stunning final 7-6, 7-5 against Federer last year - and, some say, the slight favourite tonight. Something will have to give. Play starts at: 8pm. Roughly. It ends at: don't look at me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
