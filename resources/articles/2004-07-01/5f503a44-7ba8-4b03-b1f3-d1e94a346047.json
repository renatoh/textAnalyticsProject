The wind had shifted to the south-west and upped a few notches to around 20mph, making the strategy more than ever to whistle down the wind as much as possible and hang on to your hat on the way back as the crosswind made even hitting fairways hard, never mind holding them. Royal Troon is proving sterner than a Victorian matron. After Darren Clarke's disappointing end to the first round, in which he sent his approach shot at the last long and out of bounds, costing him two shots and a share of third place, he was keen to get out again and, with a 7.25 tee time, he was not kept waiting. Brought up on the links of Northern Ireland, Clarke should feel at home in these conditions. But, having recouped those two lost shots by the 7th yesterday, he found life more of a struggle as he failed to convert the chances he made. He promptly bogeyed the Postage Stamp, unable to get up and down from sand, and faltered over the closing holes with further despondent bogeys on the par-five 16th and short 17th. At one under par Clarke is still very much in the championship but his game needs igniting every bit as much as the giant cigars he still smokes. He came dressed for business yesterday, with pinstripe trousers (very slimming) and blue top, and in the mood to swing some nifty deals early on. The first three holes, each under 400 yards, were attacked downwind with the driver and, if he found fairway bunkers twice and the rough once, then the intent was clear, and he salvaged his pars. He might have made more of the first par-five, requiring only a seven-iron for his second. So poorly did he hit it and a subsequent chip, however, that he needed to hole from 10 feet to ensure what ought to have been a certain birdie. But, having three-putted the long 6th - effectively a shot gone - he all but drove the 7th green 405 yards away, this time requiring only two putts for his second birdie. Having clung on through the middle of his round, a strong finish- possible as shown by his playing partner Kenny Perry, who had three birdies on the last four holes - would have taken him near the top of the leaderboard. The 16th might have given him one shot back and he began the hole well by laying up to the burn that crosses the fairway. The fact that a further three feet of run would have put him in the water looked too close for comfort until one remembers that his caddie Pete Coleman used to carry Bernhard Langer's bag. The German, so the story goes, was so meticulous that he demanded yardages not just from a sprinkler head but from the front or back of it. Three feet further forwards on the tee and you just know that Coleman would have clubbed Clarke differently. Clarke's three-wood second finished in a greenside bunker, however, offering a lie that was virtually impossible; that of Adam Scott, a foot or two away in the same hazard, was perfectly respectable. The Ulsterman choked down on his sand-iron, almost on to the metal of the shaft, but could only hobble the ball out and into more sand. Unable to get up and down from there and crimsoning with obvious disatisfaction with his lot, he saw another shot go. It was the same at the penultimate hole where, although his hands worked furiously to hold the ball up into the stiff wind blowing left to right, he succeeded only in missing the green on the left. Into the wind now and with plenty of green with which to work, he got his chip scarcely two-thirds of the way to the hole and was walking disconsolately after his putt the moment it had been struck. Earlier Ian Poulter, first out for the day before the style police were up and about, had shown why it is advisable to put on the light when getting dressed at 4.30. Having apparently been clothed by Coco on the first day (the Clown that is, not Chanel) he went for the Chicago pimp look yesterday with black back-to-front cap, black top, white plus-fours, black-and-white diamond pattern socks and corresponding shoes. This, apparently, is not outrageous: he is saving that for today. He should be aware, though, that there is a natural law of sport, similar to that of Murphy, which postulates that, if you persist in looking one, eventually you will play like one. Level overnight, Poulter's two birdies on the back nine helped him to a one-over-par 72 and something for the weekend but really he should be careful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
