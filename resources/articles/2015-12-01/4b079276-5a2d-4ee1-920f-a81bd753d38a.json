Guillermo Reyes Rammsy, 62, was arrested on Friday and charged over the 1973 murders of Freddy Taberna Gallegos and German Palomino Lamas, members of Chile\u2019s Socialist Party. The extraordinary confession began on Wednesday afternoon when a man called in to Chile\u2019s most famous talk show \u201cChacotero Sentimental\u201d (Loving Betrayal) and told host Roberto Artiagoit\u00eda that he was considering suicide. After briefly describing a frustrated romance, the caller went on to describe his involvement in a string of human rights crimes. He said that, as a conscript, he had participated in 18 executions, following Pinochet\u2019s military coup against the government of president Salvador Allende. \u201cThe first time [I killed someone] I cried but the lieutenant was saying: \u2018Good soldier, good soldier, brave soldier.\u2019 Then \u2018Pow. pow,\u2019 again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second time I liked it. I enjoyed it.\u201d Over the next 20 minutes, the caller described a string of human rights abuses that he had witnessed during his time in the army. \u201cI participated in 18 executions \u2026 We shot them in the head and then blew up the bodies with dynamite, there was nothing left, not even their shadow,\u201d he said. Although the caller did not give his name \u2013 or identify his victims \u2013 he was tracked down by police and charged on Friday over the deaths of Taberna and Palomina. Both men were arrested by Chilean security forces after the 1973 coup and held as political prisoners in the Pisagua prison camps in the country\u2019s northern desert. Taberna and Palomina were tried by military councils of war and executed in October and November 1973, respectively. Their bodies were never found. During his conversation with Artiagoit\u00eda, Reyes described how he was indoctrinated during his military training. \u201cThey sent me to Santiago where I learned about extreme violence and I figure about the evil one could become,\u201d he said. Reyes said that he was forced to kill because that army commanders executed military conscripts for not following orders. \u201cI was obliged, the same military would have killed me. We were grunts and they gave us orders,\u201d he said. But he appeared to show little remorse, alternating complaints about his love life with detailed descriptions of his crimes. In the course of the 20-minute exchange Artiagoit\u00eda repeatedly challenged Reyes over his claim that he was merely following orders. \u201cWhat about your responsibilities as a human?\u201d the host asked. \u201cIf we found them with a gun, we liquidated them. Pow. Pow. Pow,\u201d Reyes replied. \u201cFive shots and they were gone. They were not white doves \u2013 you had to survive,\u201d said Reyes. Reyes\u2019s arrest was cheered by human rights group who have long fought for a better understanding of how the Chilean army killed then destroyed the bodies of the victims. An estimated 3,000 people were killed by the military and security forces and 1,000 bodies have yet to be found. Reyes\u2019s arrest offers investigators fresh leads into finding the hidden bodies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
