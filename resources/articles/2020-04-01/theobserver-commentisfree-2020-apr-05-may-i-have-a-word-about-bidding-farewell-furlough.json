And that word is furlough. You simply can\u2019t move for it: \u201cRoaming free, the horses on unexpected furlough\u201d; \u201cMonzo boss waives salary for a year and offers to furlough up to 295 employees\u201d; \u201cSunderland have placed non-playing staff on furlough leave\u201d. (I do feel that the author of the latter was playing it safe with that tautology.) Even on Radio 4\u2019s Money Box, a somewhat dusty programme designed to make you feel guilty about your profligate personal financial ways, it was being bandied about with gay abandon, on one occasion even being used as a verb. Quite why it has been dredged up from the back of the lexical wardrobe is beyond me, but I\u2019ve heard and seen it quite enough now for it to be returned whence it came, if it\u2019s all the same to you. And the same goes for the following horror, courtesy of a presenter on Channel 4 News: \u201cThe epicentre of the epicentre.\u201d How vile is that? I\u2019m sure that Julian Fellowes is a master of the televisual arts, what with Downton Abbey and now Belgravia under his belt. But last week\u2019s episode of the latter left with me doubts when one character said to another: \u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d Hardly the language one would expect from a well brought up Victorian girl, I would suggest. I was recently informed that I have a touch of anaemia, information I duly passed on to my wife. Ten minutes later, I asked her what I had been told I had. \u201cAnaemia. It\u2019s a near rhyme with amnesia.\u201d If she had muttered \u201cstupid old fool\u201d under her breath, I really wouldn\u2019t have blamed her. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
