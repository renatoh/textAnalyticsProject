Bradford's coach Brian Noble admitted afterwards that his scrum-half thought he was breaking a 26-26 deadlock with a drop-goal in the 75th minute, forgetting about an Ian Hardman penalty which had put Saints 28-26 ahead. Deacon realised his mistake as the ball sailed over, throwing his hands to his head. Yet it could have proved an accidental stroke of genius if another attempt four minutes later had not drifted wide. Instead, Saints retained their one-point lead and extended it with Wellens' third try in stoppage time. \"I realised he'd made a mistake, but it worried me,\" the winning coach Ian Millward said. \"He could have kicked another one, and a draw would have been a good result for them. For us, it would have been like going to the pictures with your sister - 80 minutes of torture, and what have you got out of it at the end?\" A fifth home win of the season lifts Saints four points above the mid-table Bulls, who have had a miserable Easter. Noble, however, was encouraged by this performance. \"Our fans will know the boys have had a dig,\" he said. Certainly it was a much better match than this fixture last year, when Millward's near-reserve team lost 54-8 at Bradford, and triggered the betting scandal which led to suspensions for Sean Long and Martin Gleeson. However, Millward still insists that scheduling two matches over the Easter weekend imposes unfair demands on the players, warning yesterday that it could lead to withdrawals from the Great Britain squad at the end of the year. He received some diplomatic support from Noble, who said both teams were \"probably running on empty\". However the match undermined their argument, with the general level of exhaustion doing nothing to detract from the cut and thrust. Saints held a 22-12 lead early in the second half, thanks to Wellens' first two tries plus one each for Mike Bennett and James Roby. But the Bulls, who opened the scoring through Andy Lynch and stayed in touch when Karl Pryce crashed over, went 24-22 ahead with two tries in four minutes, by Lynch and Robbie Paul. However they were undone by a lack of composure, with Lee Radford's unnecessary pass gifting Saints the position for Darren Albert to regain the lead, and Joe Vagana's indiscipline then handing Hardman the chance to kick a simple penalty - although Deacon did not notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
