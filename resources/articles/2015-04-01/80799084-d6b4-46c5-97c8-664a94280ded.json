Separated by just a solitary competition point, it\u2019s all to play for in the top-of-the-table clashes between Wellington Phoenix and Melbourne Victory, and Sydney FC and Adelaide United. Can Victory put it all together on the big stage to make a statement of intent across the ditch? Will Adelaide keep up their fine record against a Shane Smeltz-less Sydney? Is it possible for Ernie Merrick\u2019s face to crack a smile if Wellington pull clear at the top? So many questions will be answered this Easter long weekend, and with only three full rounds of the regular season remaining after this, the stakes have never been so high. Glory facing challenges on and off the pitch Knocked off their perch after 16 consecutive rounds at the top of the ladder, Kenny Lowe\u2019s Perth Glory travel to Newcastle to face the bottom-placed Jets on Monday, playing a team they have not lost to in their past 10 encounters. It seems all set up for Perth to claim maximum points and challenge the likes of Wellington and Victory once again. However, two things could throw a spanner in the works. While the Jets are wounded, they will be no pushovers this week. The re-signing of Korean import Lee Ki-Je (one of the few rays of light in an otherwise bleak season) will boost Novocastrian spirits and, despite having a woeful home record of just one victory this term, one feels the tide must surely turn at some point. It may be drawing a long bow, but the only time the Jets have finished bottom of the pile, in season 2008-09, they defeated the Glory 2-1 at home in the penultimate round. It didn\u2019t save them from the wooden spoon then, and it may not now, but the Jets are certainly capable of upsetting teams en route to the finals. And added to that the FFA have shown Perth a second show cause notice over alleged breaches of the salary cap, and suddenly things are not looking so easy for the former table-toppers. On the line for the Roar It\u2019s not quite do-or-die for seventh-placed Brisbane, but it\u2019s getting mighty close. Last year\u2019s champions sit eight points adrift of Melbourne City in sixth with a game in hand as they prepare to host the Central Coast Mariners on Thursday night. A slip up could see them bow out of finals contention, while a win would see them put some pressure back on City, who travel to the out-of-sorts Western Sydney Wanderers on Good Friday. The problem, of course, is the Roar\u2019s shocking form of late. Having lost their last four A-League games, there is no certainty Frans Thijssen et al have what it takes to lift themselves out of the mire. It\u2019s the age-old adage, but for the Roar it will come down to their ability to finish their chances. Having dominated possession in each of their past 12 matches \u2013 that\u2019s right \u2013 they have managed to triumph on just four occasions. In their favour, the Mariners have only pride to play for at the moment, so motivation will clearly be on the Roar\u2019s side. Socceroos return to domestic action There were no surprises that there were plenty of, well, surprises in Ange Postecoglou\u2019s national team squad which drew with Germany and Macedonia over the past week. What did catch the eye was that a few of the A-League players within that side \u2013 many of whom picked up valuable international experience in Skopje \u2013 grew in stature as a result. Adelaide\u2019s Tarek Elrich, for one, looked confident in his position at right-back. It was Elrich\u2019s first cap for the \u2018Roos, and no doubt he will be eager to carry on his fine work as soon as possible. Having not been re-signed by the Newcastle Jets and Western Sydney Wanderers in seasons past, Elrich\u2019s story is one of persistence, and should be an inspiration for any footballer plying their trade in Australia. Nathan Burns \u2013 not at all a shock inclusion \u2013 Aaron Mooy and Luke DeVere were also called upon, and did not look terribly out of place in the 0-0 stalemate. Expect each of these internationals to strut back onto the A-League stage like they own the place this weekend if selected. It would not surprise to see them play vital roles for their respective clubs in round 24. Opportunity in the madness There have been plenty of football pundits to have shot down the idea of joining forces with teams from South East Asia to form a conglomerate league these past few days. And, true, it is a bit of a far-fetched notion at this point. But you can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s some sense in there somewhere, and that feeling comes from an acknowledgement that A-League clubs do not do enough to scout this particular region of the world. The diversity in the competition is something to be proud of, to be sure, though it does seem the areas in our own backyard have been somewhat neglected. FFA CEO David Gallop told News Ltd there is \u201cno enthusiasm\u201d for the idea, which is an understandable stance given the logistic and commercial implications. Maybe, though, just maybe, it will spark more discussion about players from Malaysia, Singapore or Thailand making a sojourn down under. It\u2019s not outside the realms of possibility that a few could play in the A-League before heading to Europe. Perhaps it\u2019s the football romantic talking here \u2013 and I\u2019m OK with that \u2013 but try watching the A-League this weekend and telling me it wouldn\u2019t add another dimension to see the likes of Persabaya Surabaya\u2019s Evan Dimas or BEC Tero\u2019s Chanathip Songkrasin running around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
