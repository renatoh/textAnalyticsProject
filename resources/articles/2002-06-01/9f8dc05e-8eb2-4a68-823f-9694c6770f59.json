Italy, he predicts, will get a lot further than England, which as tips go is hardly a head on the block. Later, though, after he had partnered Naheef in his final piece of work before Epsom, Dettori also suggested that the 9-1 chance offers his best hope to date of winning the one British Classic he requires to complete the set. Dettori has won each of the four remaining Classics twice, and has suffered the disappointment of being well beaten on two Derby favourites, Cape Verdi and Dubai Millennium, in the last four years. The gap in his collection has not yet reached Sir Gordon Richards proportions - the greatest jockey of the last century won his first Derby at the 28th and final attempt - but it is one he needs to fill sooner rather than later. \"To be honest, this could be the first Derby horse I've had who is suited to the race,\" Dettori said. \"Cape Verdi wasn't a Derby runner until after she'd won the Guineas, and Dubai Millennium wasn't until two or three weeks before. You need a horse which is well-balanced and can accelerate. What you don't want is a giant of a horse that struggles around the turns. Naheef seems the perfect horse for the race, he's well-balanced and he has the speed.\" There was evidence of both traits as Naheef strode clear of Sydenham at the end of an easy five-furlong workout. Kazzia, Godolphin's Oaks filly, and the Coronation Cup entries Kutub and Marienbard also worked smoothly, as did Sakhee, last year's Arc winner, who is still several weeks away from his first race of the season. But it is the Derby that they want above all, and while Moon Ballad, Godolphin's Dante Stakes winner, deserves his place in the field, Naheef is the flag-carrier. His form - and his disappointing 14th of 22 in the 2,000 Guineas in particular - gives him something to find, while his previous meeting with Hawk Wing, the Derby favourite, in last year's National Stakes at The Curragh resulted in a comprehen sive 2 length defeat. The step up to a mile and a half, however, could make all the difference. \"The race is a crescendo from four-and-a-half out,\" Dettori said. \"The pace is continually quickening, which will test anybody's speed. Hawk Wing will have to follow the crescendo and then quicken off it. Our horse will come into his own at the distance.\" While Dettori was happy to talk up his chance, though, Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, was more circumspect. \"He was the one horse that has disappointed us this year when he ran in the Guineas,\" Crisford said. \"He ran a good trial in Dubai and he's a horse that is peaking at the right time, but he's going to have to show us something we have never seen before if he's going to win.\" The belief that Naheef needs to improve, while Hawk Wing needs only to stay, accounts for much of the gap between the two colts in the ante-post betting. Yet the place part of an each-way bet on Naheef at 9-1 would return more than a win bet on Hawk Wing, who is as low as 5-4 with Hill's after heavy support yesterday, which makes him an attractive option if you prefer Dettori's brand of optimism to Crisford's. As for Kazzia's chance in the Oaks on Friday, Dettori feels that she is \"strong, tough and game and will not go down without a fight,\" while in the Coronation Cup, he has chosen Kutub, the winner of four Group One races last season, ahead of Marienbard, who won the 2001 Yorkshire Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
