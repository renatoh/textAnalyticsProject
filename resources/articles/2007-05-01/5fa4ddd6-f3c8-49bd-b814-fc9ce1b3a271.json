The employers' organisation prompted speculation in the City that the Bank of England might need to follow a May increase in borrowing costs with further anti-inflationary action over the coming months when it reported that activity in the shops in April hit a three-year high. Financial markets were last night awaiting a speech today from the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, for hints on the mood inside Threadneedle Street. Mr King was forced to write his first explanatory letter to Gordon Brown in a decade last month after inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose to 3.1% - more than a percentage point higher than the chancellor's 2% target. Three pieces of data signalled strength in the economy. The monthly snapshot of manufacturing from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed output in industry at its highest since last September and firms increasingly confident about passing on increases in costs to their customers through higher prices. In addition, March data for the property market from the Land Registry showed house price inflation edging up to 8.3%, while the CBI said the hot weather in April combined with a late Easter had provided a boost for shops and stores. Almost two-thirds of retailers (64%) said business was up on April 2006 against 20% reporting a fall. The balance of +44% was the highest since May 2004 and retailers believe trade this month will be almost as good. A balance of +36% of firms said they expected year-on-year growth in sales volumes. John Longworth, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: \"Sales grew strongly over the first two weeks of April, surpassing expectations and ensuring another very pleasing month for the high street. \"Retailers were helped by buoyant Easter trading and unusually warm weather, which may have boosted sales in sectors like groceries and DIY. Looking ahead, retailers expect demand to remain strong as we head into the summer and the recent trend of healthy sales growth looks set to continue.\" The CBI said retailers had run down their stocks to meet the strong demand and were now expecting to increase their orders with suppliers. Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said: \"These data continue the recent run of strong activity data and worrying lead inflation guides. In particular, there is no sign that recent rate hikes are causing consumers to retrench in any significant way at all. The headwind from rising interest rates seems to be offset, so far, by strong job growth and the clear pick up in pay deals this year.\" He added: \"A rate hike in May is a virtual certainty, and the debate at next week's MPC meeting is likely to be over the extent to which the Inflation Report (the Bank's quarterly analysis of the state of the economy) signals that further tightening beyond May is likely, and the degree of urgency. Our view remains that rates will rise by a quarter-point in May with another hike soon after.\" Economists believe that the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, will keep interest rates on hold next week but maintain its anti-inflationary vigilance after yesterday's survey of US manufacturing showed an unexpected pick up in activity and a sharp increase in the price of goods leaving factory gates. Despite separate data pointing to a further slowdown in the US housing market, the Fed is expected to keep the cost of borrowing unchanged at 5.25% until the Autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
