It is a blueprint that has left every player with a personal training programme to be undertaken in private and the training ground undergoing frequent fumigation procedures during an impending two-week shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about what would happen if everything was suspended for the past four weeks now,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager as he endorsed the postponement of all Premier League fixtures until 4 April. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any alternative. My staff and I were sitting watching the TV yesterday and the news [games were then going ahead] came through from the prime minister, and we all thought: \u2018OK.\u2019 \u201cWe were saying: \u2018Well, what happens if one of the players or a manager gets it?\u2019 And then lo and behold, Mikel Arteta did; it was inevitable, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Some clubs with more modern weekday headquarters may opt to keep their squads together but Newcastle\u2019s base, in one of the city\u2019s northern suburbs, is old, cramped and in need of either renovation or relocation. In other words, it represents a perfect environment for viruses to spread; which is why the club has taken the precaution of closing both it and the nearby academy for the next fortnight. \u201cThe plan is for the players to go away with their own individual programmes, we\u2019ve set the personal plans in place and they\u2019re ready to go,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cIt\u2019s to take them away from here because we\u2019re on top of each other. There\u2019s 70 or 80 of us in a confined space so if someone got infected and then came back here that clearly would be an issue \u2013 and coronavirus is so contagious.\u201d The one exception is physiotherapy, with injured players unable to be treated at home still potentially attending the medical department. \u201cI would think players needing physio or having a course of treatment will be coming in to the training ground,\u201d said Bruce. He is open-minded about any of his squad who may want to either return to their home country or take a short break abroad somewhere warm; particularly as sunnier, hotter countries often have fewer incidences of the virus. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chat with our doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you stay here or go abroad you run a risk of contracting it. I\u2019ll be guided by the individual medical advice.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager was flanked by hand sanitisers as he spoke but his workplace was being regularly sprayed with anti-viral and bacterial agents even before coronavirus reached the UK. It is a form of fumigation that has been in operation since Christmas when a different bug swept through Newcastle\u2019s playing and off-field staff. Last Sunday marked the latest in a series of thorough sprayings and the amount of hand-sanitising dispensers was increased. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had to guard against things anyway,\u201d said Bruce, whose squad and staff currently remain healthy. \u201cIt\u2019s not the biggest training ground and there\u2019s not loads of windows so you can\u2019t get a lot of fresh air through it. It\u2019s always a problem for us. We\u2019ve always had to guard against sickness and bugs. \u201cWe had a little bit of it over the Christmas period when we had four or five feeling a bit unwell. If you\u2019re not careful and don\u2019t isolate them, it can rampage through the place. Steve Clemence [the first-team coach] didn\u2019t come to the game at Manchester United because he was sick \u2013 we had a few sick at Christmas.\u201d Some of Bruce\u2019s peers advocated playing behind closed doors but he has never regarded that as a feasible option. \u201cYou play football to be in front of fans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would have been 52,000 at St James\u2019 Park for Sheffield United on Saturday and the game is all about those supporters. The idea of playing in front of nobody doesn\u2019t appeal at all. For me, you\u2019ve got to suspend it and wait until you get the all clear. \u201cThousands could die from this disease; people\u2019s welfare is more important than a football match, a season or a tournament.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
