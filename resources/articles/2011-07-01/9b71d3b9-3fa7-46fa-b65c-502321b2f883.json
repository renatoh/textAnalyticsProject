The main sea connection for me when I was younger was when the fisherman from Clogherhead, Co Louth would come into town and my father would buy a big bag of herrings from them. We'd gut them, quickly fry them and eat them with brown bread \u2013 exactly the same way I like to eat mackerel today. To me, mackerel is the most gorgeous food in the world. Every year I have a secret getaway and rent a cottage in Hook Head and do nothing but go fishing on my little boat. I put out my rod, get bucketloads of mackerel and eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I even stay up curing and pickling them through the night for the neighbours sometimes.\" Sea-cured mackerel SERVES 4 For the sea-cured mackerel: mackerel 4, filleted sugar 50g white wine vinegar 100ml samphire 200g mustard a little to dress For Corrigan's soda bread: white flour 500g wholemeal flour 250g oatmeal 250g soda 25g salt 25g honey 1 tbsp treacle \u00bd tbsp buttermilk 500ml The night before make the soda bread. Mix all the ingredients together to form a round loaf. Sprinkle with flour and bake at 180C/gas mark 4 until golden brown and hollow, approximately 45 minutes. To make the sea-cured mackerel, in a sand bucket of sea water cure the fillets for 10 minutes. Pat dry in a newspaper. Mix the sugar and vinegar and pour over the fillets for a further 10 minutes. At the beach, scour the rock pools for samphire or similar sea vegetable. Dress with a little mustard.
