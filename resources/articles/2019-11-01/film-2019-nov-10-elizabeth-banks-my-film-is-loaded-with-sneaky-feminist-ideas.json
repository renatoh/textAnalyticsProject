Believe me, if I was Julia Roberts, I would not be working this hard.\u201d Over the past two decades, Banks has been working very hard indeed. And if her name isn\u2019t instantly familiar, her body of work certainly is. She has been a regular in commercial comedy films \u2013 The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting (2012) \u2013 and a recurring guest star on TV shows such as 30 Rock and Modern Family, for which she received Emmy nominations. For a time she played the eccentric Effie Trinket in the wildly successful Hunger Games trilogy (2012\u20132015) while simultaneously playing the gobby Gail Abernathy-McKadden in the Pitch Perfect series (2012-2017). But it\u2019s Banks\u2019s work as a producer (on Pitch Perfect) and a director (on Pitch Perfect 2, which became the highest-grossing music comedy film of all time) that has brought her international recognition. She has transformed from jobbing actor to bankable filmmaker, a transition that is usually fraught and complicated \u2013 but she has made it seem easy. This month sees the release of a new Charlie\u2019s Angels reboot, a film Banks has written, produced and directed. Now 45, she has become what the industry might call a triple threat: an actress, a filmmaker and a business magnate rolled into one. \u201cI was a frustrated actor,\u201d she says. We\u2019re chatting in a low-key LA neighbourhood brunch spot, an airy-fairy sort of place that seems at odds with her work ethic. There are instructions to: \u201cLeave your laptop in the bag please, this table is for dining, daydreaming and conversation.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough to do,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe industry wasn\u2019t offering me enough. It wasn\u2019t permitting me to tell the stories I wanted to tell.\u201d Julia Roberts never has those problems. \u201cShe decides what she wants to do, when she wants to. You have to make your own opportunities.\u201d In 2013, Banks was on the lookout for a romcom to direct when Pitch Perfect 2 came along. The opportunity was unexpected. She\u2019d been following her own path for a while. She\u2019d directed and starred in a public service announcement for the American Heart Association that \u201cwent very viral\u201d and a funny short film with the actor Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz. Banks had already set up a production company, Brownstone, with her husband, the sportswriter Max Handelman. When the director of Pitch Perfect declined to take on a sequel, Banks considered it a no-brainer to take the job. She\u2019d been a producer on the franchise already; she had all the intel she needed. I suggest Banks has been a frustrated director on set her whole career and she shrieks: \u201cI\u2019m not the only one!\u201d She learned everything she knows on the job, Banks says. \u201cBut that means you recognise pretty quickly when you\u2019re in a process with somebody who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. And when you\u2019re trusting your performance with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s terrifying. It happens to everybody. We all work with people who are not up to the job.\u201d Banks recalls going into a meeting at Sony to announce, simply: \u201c\u2018I want to direct a Charlie\u2019s Angels movie.\u2019 To be able to work for a big studio with a big budget? They don\u2019t usually just hand that out. But I felt ready and confident.\u201d Pitch Perfect 2 earned $69m on opening weekend, setting a record for a first-time director, bringing Banks accolades as a filmmaker. Suddenly she was in demand in a way she hadn\u2019t quite been previously: to realise a film\u2019s larger vision, rather than play a smaller, acting role within it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I could have directed whatever I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I definitely had leeway to have some autonomy over what I was going to do next.\u201d Watching Charlie\u2019s Angels, it\u2019s impossible to question her ambition. Charles Townsend\u2019s investigative agency has expanded and there are now groups of Angels \u2013 all smart, highly trained women \u2013 across the world. Banks plays a key role: Bosley to the Angels Sabina (Kristen Stewart), Elena (Naomi Scott) and Jane (Ella Balinska). Some of the film\u2019s details \u2013 for example, a female employee discovers a sinister plot in a large tech company, but is dismissed by her male bosses \u2013 might be construed as political. Is that impossible to avoid in 2019? \u201cI\u2019m not making any grand statements,\u201d she says. \u201cI happened to make an action movie about corporate malfeasance that also happens to star women and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What a political statement!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Is it?\u2019 If they were all men and it was the exact same story, it wouldn\u2019t be very political, would it? I wanted to make a broader, appealing movie rather than something actually political.\u201d She finds it interesting that \u201csimply because I made a movie that stars women, that it\u2019s feminist enough. That\u2019s something I heard when I was putting the movie together. Like, \u2018You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re getting to make it, it\u2019s feminist enough. You don\u2019t have to push it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pushing it at all!\u2019\u201d Banks has ditched the male gaze of Charlie\u2019s Angels past and has loaded the film with \u201csneaky feminist ideas\u201d. \u201cLittle things,\u201d she says, \u201clike, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to smile!\u2019\u201d Because the reality for female directors, she says, is that they are still not afforded the same opportunities as men. Even those who get to direct a juggernaut like Charlie\u2019s Angels. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard anyone say to a man, \u2018You can\u2019t direct that story because it\u2019s about a woman,\u2019 and yet I have been told \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you who said it \u2013 that I couldn\u2019t direct men because they \u2018wouldn\u2019t follow me\u2019 as a director. Directing is all about leadership. So basically they were saying I couldn\u2019t lead. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of difficult men as an actor and it\u2019s never been a problem. A good leader is a good leader. I did not take to heart what that gentleman said to me, but I\u2019m also positive he\u2019s never said that to a man.\u201d Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to a bank clerk and a factory worker. The eldest of four children, she grew up in a close-knit family that \u201cdid a wonderful job raising me and have been completely supportive my whole life\u201d. But things were not always easy. \u201cMy upbringing was socio-economically tough,\u201d she says, which \u201cmeant that you had to make decisions about what you could afford.\u201d How bad did things get? \u201cIt\u2019s what Kamala Harris talks about a lot now. A $500 emergency will put a lot of families into bankruptcy, basically. That\u2019s what it was like. When I was growing up, if the car broke down, it was a state of emergency. My parents did an excellent job shielding us from it. But to me, a big part of success is not worrying if the car breaks down.\u201d Banks met her husband on her first day at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. She went on to study at the American Conservatory Theater, before the couple settled in LA and married in 2003. They are now parents to two boys, both born via gestational surrogacy because of a womb issue, or what Banks refers to on her personal blog as her \u201cbroken belly\u201d. \u201cWe make a \u2018baby cake,\u2019\u201d she explained at the time, \u201cand bake it in another woman\u2019s \u2018oven\u2019.\u201d The family practise Judaism, though Banks has never formally converted. When we meet, Jewish New Year is just a few days away. \u201cWe\u2019re being bad Jews this year because we decided to take the kids to Disneyland,\u201d Banks says, her eyes lighting up. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re going. It\u2019s a surprise! They have the day off school and I felt like if we stayed here I would get pulled into work, but this way I\u2019m out for the day. I\u2019m taking my youngest on his first rollercoaster and I\u2019m so excited.\u201d After a decade in the same home, the Banks clan recently upgraded to a sizeable property in Sherman Oaks and she\u2019s enjoying doing the \u201cnesting, decorating and organising\u201d that the past 10 years have not exactly allowed for. She\u2019s getting better, Banks says, at taking time out. \u201cI want to be available for my kids as much as I can be. We might try and do a Saturday date night, but we don\u2019t leave the house until the kids are in bed so they don\u2019t miss a minute with us on the weekend. I decide when I have to work. That provides comfort and space for the other things I love, which is my family and my friends. I have control over my time. If I don\u2019t want to do something, I say no.\u201d Talk turns to pay parity. Michelle Williams has just broached the issue in a speech at the Emmys. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the greatest actors of her generation,\u201d Banks says. \u201cAnd she works so hard on every job and yet, in Venom, Tom Hardy made way more money than her. It\u2019s hard to be, like: \u2018You guys, you know sometimes just paying us tells us that you like us!\u2019 You can show that you value us in many ways. One is by giving us awards, one is by letting us play really cool roles, another one is to pay us.\u201d She\u2019s deadpanning. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re expected as women not to value money as a factor in our worth when it\u2019s a factor in everyone\u2019s worth.\u201d Does she feel that things are starting to improve at all? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope. Honestly, I\u2019m having a hard time feeling optimistic in the world we\u2019re living in today in general. Whether that\u2019s about women being directors or women having autonomy over their bodies, I feel like every step forward we\u2019re looking over our shoulder waiting to see if they\u2019re going to come for us.\u201d How long has she been feeling like this \u2013 since Trump was elected? \u201cUh huh.\u201d In 2016 Banks gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton, where she famously parodied the soon-to-be-president. \u201cSome of you know me from The Hunger Games, in which I play Effie Trinket, a cruel, out-of-touch reality TV star who wears insane wigs while delivering long-winded speeches to a violent dystopia,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when I tuned into Cleveland last week, I was like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s my act!\u2019\u201d Her show of support for Hillary was \u201ca no-brainer if you\u2019re a feminist,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m here for more justice in the world, generally. There was all this anecdotal evidence that the system works against us. And now the system is openly and actively working against us. I\u2019m a white lady and it\u2019s so much worse for people of colour and non-cisgendered people and I\u2019m totally aware of that. That\u2019s depressing to me because I\u2019m someone who believes in the more the merrier at the table. We are living globally and we can\u2019t put that genie back in the bottle, so let\u2019s help each other.\u201d I\u2019d pick her brain on this more if we had longer. But as soon as our meeting ends there\u2019s a blacked out SUV waiting for her. There\u2019s no let-up, but I\u2019m certain Banks wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do next,\u201d she muses, before heading off. \u201cI have to get pitching. And reading. And coalescing things into reality.\u201d Charlie\u2019s Angels is released on 29 November Hair by Mark Townsend at Starworks; makeup by Fiona Stiles at Starworks; stylists Wendi &amp; Nicole at Forwards Artists.
