Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank said wealthy professionals often chose to form companies and partnerships to be eligible for lower capital gains tax (CGT) rates rather than collect salaries that would be subject to the top rate of income tax. HMRC data shows 9,000 people paid just \u00a35.1bn in tax on \u00a333.7bn of capital gains income in the latest financial year available. That works out at an average tax rate of 14.8%, lower than than the basic rate income tax of 20% that people pay on salaries of between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000. Andy Summers, a tax expert and assistant professor at the London School of Economics, said that despite recent changes to tax rules, private equity fund managers were still able to receive most of their remuneration in the form of \u201ccarried interest\u201d, taxed as capital gains instead of income. Other highly paid professionals can convert their income into gains by retaining profits inside their companies as they approach retirement. \u201cCapital gains are highly concentrated at the very top of the income distribution; the vast majority of reported gains go to people who received more in one year than a worker on the median wage would earn in their entire lifetime,\u201d he said at an IFS conference in London on Tuesday titled \u201cInequality and the very rich: what do we need to know?\u201d Business owners can qualify for entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, under which they can pay just 10% CGT when they sell all or part of a company. The standard CGT rate is 20%. This compares with the 40% income tax rate on salaries of between \u00a350,001 and \u00a3150,000. People recording gains of more than \u00a31m each accounted for 62% of all capital gains receipts in the 2017-18 financial year, the latest available data set. Mike Brewer, a professor of economics at the University of Essex and expert on inequality, who chaired the debate, said: \u201cCapital gains are not counted as income when the Office of National Statistics, Department for Work and Pensions and Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate income inequality in the UK. This means that our impression of inequality or top income shares is overlooking 9,000 people all with at least \u00a31m of capital gains, with an average capital gain of \u00a33.7m, and a total capital gain of \u00a334bn.\u201d Robert Palmer, the executive director of Tax Justice UK, a campaign group lobbying for a fairer tax system, said: \u201cPoliticians need to address the low tax lifestyle option open to the wealthy. It can\u2019t be right that a hedge fund manager is able to pay less tax than their cleaner by arranging their tax affairs this way. \u201cRecent polling we carried out found that the public overwhelmingly agrees income from capital gains should be taxed at least at the same level as income from work, this should be a no brainer for all politicians.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe want a tax system where everyone pays their fair share, while also ensuring supporting investment and growth.\u201d Separately, HM Revenue &amp; Customs announced it was writing to 5,000 people who hold investments in offshore funds to warn that they face 200% tax penalty fines on any gains made if they failed to declare their offshore interests correctly. \u201cEnsuring the correct UK tax is paid on offshore investment funds can be complex,\u201d a HMRC spokesman said. \u201cThis activity is to help people with complex affairs make sure that they have paid the right amount of tax at the right time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
