He was criticised at the time for the simplistic analysis, but there\u2019s something to the sentiment. The Arab spring demonstrators calling for an end to the autocratic Assad regime have been brutally hunted down, and many of the fighters who have entered Syria are there for ideological reasons which have nothing to do with a free and pluralistic Syria. The humanitarian effort in Syria and neighbouring countries is like nothing the world has ever seen. The conflict in Syria has already killed more than 100,000 people, an estimated 11,000 of those children. About 2.3 million people have left the country and 6.5 million are internally displaced. More than half of those who have fled are children, and more than half of those living in the camps in Jordan are under 18 years old. Inside Syria, people are risking their lives to deliver food, treat the wounded and shelter those who have fled their homes. It is almost impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies to some parts of the country. When Bob Carr was foreign minister, he constructed a five-point plan for Syria\u2019s transition which included arrangements for opening protected humanitarian corridors for the delivery of supplies. Australia's chairing of the UN security council heightens our obligation to ensure humanitarian organisations can get food, water, medical supplies and treatment to all parts of the country. Undoubtedly it is difficult. There are reports of people in besieged towns starving. The Syrian government and its opponents have reportedly targeted medical emergency workers, with doctors and even volunteers killed for offering medical care without distinguishing between fighting groups. There is little optimism that talks in Geneva beginning tomorrow will deliver durable peace or even a broad ceasefire, but if the international community could ensure better access for humanitarian relief that would decidedly be a win. Outside Syria, the others that need our help are those dealing with the flood of refugees. I was in Jordan at the weekend, visiting the Za'atari refugee camp. With 10 days notice the UNHCR built a camp for 10,000 refugees. That camp now houses about 85,0000, but has had as many as 120,000 residents. Well over half are children. But the camp is home to just one in five Syrian refugees living in Jordan. More than 580,000 Syrians have taken shelter with their Jordanian neighbours and registered with the UN, but many are living in the community without registering. Jordan is a country of around 6.6 million. Almost 10% of its current population are Syrian refugees. That comes on top of more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. UNHCR officials tell me the Syrians universally just want to be safe to go home, and every person I spoke to yesterday in Za'atari told me the same thing. They miss their homes. They are not looking for new homes overseas. But that will change if the conflict drags on, and it will change unless life in the camps still offers some hope for the future. International organisations have responded to this challenge with superhuman effort. In Jordan, as well as the Za'atari camp, they are building a second camp that will be three times as large and ready for the tens of thousands of extra refugees expected in coming months. The fact the UN\u2019s appeal for funds is the biggest yet underscores the historic scale of this crisis. Last week in Kuwait, countries met to pledge their contributions to the UN fund. Britain gave an extra $164m, Norway gave $75m, Kuwait gave $500m. Australia gave just $12m. The previous Labor government gave around $100m from 2011 to 2013. Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and to a lesser extent Iraq will bear most of the weight of the flood of refugees, mainly women and children, leaving Syria. These neighbours, who share culture and kinship ties with Syria, have been largely welcoming. Syrians who register with Jordanian authorities can access government services like schooling and healthcare; Turkey calls Syrians guests not refugees. But these are not wealthy countries to start with, and the surge in population adds severe strain on schools, hospitals, infrastructure, and other public services. Syrians take any work they can get, driving down wages. Syrians who can afford to, rent or invest in property \u2013 driving up the real estate market in some places by 300% in a matter of weeks. And Jordan is the fourth most water-poor country in the world. The sustainability of Jordan\u2019s water supply was already a dire issue prior to the crisis. The Howard government gave $1bn to Indonesia after the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. The $12m Australia pledged to UN relief efforts last week does not reflect the scale of the humanitarian disaster facing Syrians or Australia\u2019s generous tradition. This year Unicef collected $6m in donations in just four weeks after typhoon Haiyan but has struggled to reach a million dollars for the Syrian relief effort. Australians are generous people, but Syria is far away and in a conflict that seems will go on for years. It's easy to overlook a horror show that we've sadly gotten too used to playing on mute in the background of our everyday lives. Millions of innocent people are caught in the middle of the conflict. People are risking their lives to deliver aid in Syria. There is an army of humanitarian workers and volunteers \u2013 including many inspiring Australians \u2013 and of course the Syrians themselves, who just want to be able to live safely in the land they love. They need our help."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
