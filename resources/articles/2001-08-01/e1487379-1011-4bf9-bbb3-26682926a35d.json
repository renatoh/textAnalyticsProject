Inside thousands of homes, children slump on the couch watching television and playing computer games, curtains closed to stop the sunshine hitting the screen and spoiling the images. Some of them will go swimming, play tennis, or get on their bikes, but a lot won't. Health experts agonise about the damage the couch potato kids are doing to their systems, but a growing body of evidence seems to suggests that, in the short term at least, their academic performance might be more affected by their sedentary life styles. Research is still in its infancy, but the argument goes basically like this: increased physical activity increases blood flow to the brain and, when coupled with learning tasks (physical or mental), causes the formation of dendrites - the slender filaments that branch out of the neurons and increase the neural pathways and neural mapping of the brain. This is believed to increase intelligence in mammals and foster greater learning through improved intelligence. Susan Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University and one of the world's leading experts on the brain, says that your activities do affect the brain. US studies have shown that, for example, listening to classical music can raise the IQ and that, in later age, slumping on a couch to watch TV may cause Alzheimer's. \"The brain is very sensitive to what is happening to the body and the more you are interacting and stimulating the circuits of the brain, the more agile are your brain cells,\" says Greenfield. In Exeter, a project called Fit to Succeed - in which children at seven middle schools were encouraged to take part in much more regular physical activity - appears to be proving the link with academic performance. Scores in government Sats tests have been highest in the children who reported exercising at least three times a week. And it hasn't been just children from middle-class homes, who might have had more opportunity for extra activities, who have been getting better marks. The effect is clearly discernible in children on free school meals - those from economically disadvantaged homes. If they are exercising at least three times a week, they are getting better Sats scores. The study shows, for example, that more than 60% of 11-year-old boys who achieved level 5 - above average for the age group - in their maths Sats had taken part in hard exercise the previous week on at least three occasions. In the Fit to Succeed project, children were given access to free sports outside school hours and their teachers were asked to lay on more physical activities during the school day. Some schools, such as Pinhoe Church of England Combined School, have introduced physical activity sessions in the few minutes between lessons, to great effect (For more on this read Feeling good, doing better). There are fewer behavioural problems and teachers report that the children are more focused on their lessons and thus learn better. Sats scores are improving and the physical activity programmes are thought to be part of the academic success story. Fit to Succeed is being extended into all of Exeter's middle and high schools, with a \u00a333,000 grant from the children's charity Barnado's and the drugs company Glaxo/Wellcome. Steve Kibble, senior physical education adviser for Devon, says: \"More active children are more alert. After exercise the metabolism is raised for four or five hours - medical evidence supports this. We can't say physical activity will improve your IQ, but it does help maximise learning potential. We should be looking much more holistically at education, What point is there having five A-levels if you are going to die at 26 from cardiovascular problems?\" Research in different parts of the world points to a link between levels of activity and improvements in learning potential. In a long-term French study, pupils had their normal timetable modified throughout the final year of their primary education. The school week was lengthened by 9.5 hours, and two siestas were introduced each day. Academic instruction was curtailed by 26% and was limited to mornings. The afternoons were occupied by a wide range of physical activities such as gymnastics, swimming and sport. The progress of the experimental group was then compared with that of students attending other schools in the Paris area. The fascinating finding was that although the extra activity group was getting 26% less lesson time, the proportion failing to attain the \"certificate of study\" for the end of their primary education was no worse than the other students. Pupils were also more calm and attentive, and exhibited fewer disciplinary problems - just like the children at Pinhoe School. In another French study, children who were given extra daily physical activity by a specialist, and less lesson time, actually outperformed the children getting less activity. In an Australian study, better levels of behaviour and arithmetic scores were also seen in an Adelaide group who were given more fitness activities. Two years later the extra-active children were still exhibiting better behaviour and their reading scores, as well as their arithmetic ones, were up. And work in America shows that programmes of physical activity increases the mental performance of learning-impaired children. Ben Tan, director of the British Heart Foundation's national centre for physical activity and health at Loughborough University, has reviewed much research and says: \"There does seem to be a strong correlation between high levels of physical activity and high academic achievement in schools. It increases the concentration of children and their ability to learn. In schools that invest in PE and after-school sport you can see a major improvement in academic achievement.\" This is borne out by the early results of a three-year investigation into the effectiveness of physical education and school sport begun in April last year by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. QCA researchers conducted in-depth interviews at 30 schools and found that those with high participation in sports tend to have lower truancy rates and less bad behaviour. Regular and frequent participation in purposeful physical activity, they say, enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and levels of attainment, health, fitness, well-being, self-esteem, motivation and, crucially, their attitudes to, and engagement in, learning. At one primary school in the study, 11-year-old pupils achieved the school's best-ever Sats results and were also brilliant at PE. Pupils have two hours of PE a week as well as the chance to do another four to five hours of clubs and out-of-hours activities. Some pupils take part in up to 20 hours of sport and PE per week. The head teacher was reported as saying: \"We are committed to the whole child, and PE and the arts are as important as any other subject. I think self-esteem is the key to children's achievement and much of this comes from PE and sport.\" The government is funding sport and PE in schools to the tune of \u00a31 billion over the next three years. This will involve rebuilding facilities, and setting up more elite sports academies for talented children. Ministers want to see children fitter and they want to see the country produce more sporting superstars. Our poor performance on the world sport stage was underlined in our own backyard this summer with the loss yet again of the Ashes and our inability to produce a Wimbledon champion. School sport and PE has been squeezed and neglected in recent years by government emphasis on improving academic standards. And tight local authority budgets have seen school sports fields being sold off. According to research by Sport England published last year, the amount of sport played in primary schools had been reduced by a third in the previous five years. Those children and teenagers idling their summers away in front of computer and TV screens are the product of a school system which has advanced improvements in academic performance at the expense of physical activity. If they had kept up the levels of physical activity of previous school generations, they might also have been achieving the higher levels of academic performance the government was looking for all along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
