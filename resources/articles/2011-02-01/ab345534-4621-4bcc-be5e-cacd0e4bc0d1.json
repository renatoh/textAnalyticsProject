As the Labour leader published research showing that high earners have benefited disproportionately from rising wages over the past 30 years, the chancellor dismissed the campaign in a withering Guardian article. \"Let's pass over his repeated failure in every interview to define [the squeezed middle] \u2013 his last effort included around 90% of taxpayers,\" Obsorne writes. The chancellor's assessment comes after Miliband intensified his campaign on behalf of Britain's \"squeezed middle\" by publishing research showing 22p in every pound of increased wages between 1979 and 2005 went to the highest earners. The Labour leader produced the analysis \u2013 carried out by the House of Commons library \u2013 at the launch of a cross-party commission on living standards that will investigate and propose ways to deal with the imbalance between those who gained from recent economic growth and those who have lost out. Set up by the Resolution Foundation, the commission will spend 14 months looking into what can be done to ameliorate factors affecting the third of the working population earning between \u00a311,000 and \u00a333,000, or the \"squeezed middle\". The chancellor says Miliband's campaign is not credible because Labour's economic policy is riddled with contradictions. Osborne says Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has belatedly signed up to Alistair Darling's plans to halve the fiscal deficit over four years. This would involve \u00a314bn of spending cuts in the coming financial year \u2013 just \u00a32bn less than the coalition's plans. Osborne writes: \"The Labour leadership claims it would stick to Darling's plan to halve the deficit in four years, but day after day it opposes the spending cuts that requires ... With just five weeks to go until April we know everything about the cuts Labour opposes but nothing about the cuts it supports.\" The chancellor admits British families are facing \"difficult times\" as their incomes are squeezed by rising food prices and the consequences of cutting Britain's record peacetime fiscal deficit. \"Where we can all agree is that these are difficult times for family incomes. There are two root causes of this trend. One is global: rises in food and commodity prices. The other is specific to the UK: the unwinding, through a 25% currency depreciation and an unavoidable fiscal consolidation, of economic imbalances built up under Labour. That is why the governor of the Bank of England has said 'the real consequences of this crisis are only beginning to be felt'.\" Members of the cross-party commission on living standards are drawn from banking, finance and social policy and include figures from big employers such as British Gas, who will represent realistic industry opinion on policy dilemmas like paying higher wages. All 12 members have been told they will have to have something to say on ideas such as the living wage, whether positive or negative. Those on low to middle incomes have become a central concern to the three main political parties, which are jostling to demonstrate they best understand the needs of the cohort. The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who is to speak at Resolution's next event, has begun work on policies affecting this group, choosing to translate literally a phrase from the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and name the demographic \"alarm clock Britain\", reflecting that these families feel they rise for work early and return late, squeezing living standards. All parties are aware that low earners \u2013 for whom food and fuel bills are a greater part of their household budget \u2013 are feeling current inflation levels most acutely. Miliband, who stumbled over Christmas when he was unable to define the precise nature of the \"squeezed middle\", proposed areas he hopes the commission looks into. Emphasising the tax and benefit system could do only so much to address the problem, and effort had to be put into getting business to take some of the load, he suggested: \u2022 Tax incentives for companies to encourage them to pay a higher level of a guaranteed wage \u2013 a living wage at \u00a37.80 that reflects the greater cost of living but is a cost fully borne by the employer. \u2022 Incentives to encourage companies to improve the skills of their workers so that they qualify for better-paid jobs \u2013 in Germany, he said, 80% of employees in retailing had had vocational training lasting two or three years and that allowed them to progress into managerial careers, compared with only three out of 10 of their British counterparts. When asked whether the task was economically viable when British companies faced competition from foreign, lower-paying multinationals, Miliband said: \"I don't subscribe to that fatalistic view\" and pointed out his examples of better models came from Germany, which has stayed competitive with countries such as China. Resolution's chair of trustees, Clive Cowdery, supported this position, saying the five main industries that employed half of all low-paid workers in the UK were largely insulated from truly international competition with the rising economic powers of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The concern would, however, remain a problem in another of the big five low-paying industries \u2013 manufacturing. Miliband repeated his criticism that Labour had been wrong, when in government, not to put sufficient thought into the type of economy it was building and failed to think how to help the creation of jobs for low to middle earners. He said a Labour government led by him would not remain \"neutral\" about the future quality of jobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
