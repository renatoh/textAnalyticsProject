But big things are being predicted for The King's Speech and its expected awards season success began last night when it won the top prize at the British independent film awards. The film, telling the true story of George VI's battle to overcome his chronic stammer and make the speech of his life, was named best film at the 13th Bifas. It won the biggest share of prizes \u2013 five awards in total at the London ceremony, also hoovering up most of the acting honours. Colin Firth won best actor for his moving performance as the reluctant king who was forced on to the throne by his brother's abdication in December 1936 \u2013 a portrayal that is also putting him on most Oscar tip-lists. Helena Bonham Carter was named best supporting actress for her role as Elizabeth \u2013 before she became the Queen Mother \u2013 while Geoffrey Rush won best supporting actor for his performance as the eccentric and unusual Lionel Logue, the therapist who helps the king. It is a very British film, but it was written by an American, David Seidler, who completed the awards success by winning the best screenplay prize. The film opened in the US last week to positive reviews \u2013 \"The emotion this film produces is staggering,\" said Rolling Stone magazine \u2013 but British audiences must wait until 7 January to see The King's Speech on general release. The remaining acting prize was won by Carey Mulligan for the second year running. Last year she won for An Education and she was named best actress again this year for her role as Kathy in Never Let Me Go, adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro's novel. The King's Speech director Tom Hooper missed out on being named best director in a strikingly strong shortlist that also included Mike Leigh (Another Year), Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) and Mark Romanek (Never Let Me Go). Instead, the award went to Gareth Edwards for his debut feature film Monsters \u2013 a sci-fi film all the more remarkable because of its tiny budget of just $500,000. The film follows a photographer escorting the daughter of his media tycoon boss through \"the infected zone\" in Mexico \u2013 an area off-limits because of the arrival of scary-looking, supposedly hostile aliens. Monsters also won awards for best achievement in production while Edwards' visual effects won him the best technical achievement award. Edwards was also eligible for the Douglas Hickox award given to the most impressive debut director, which was won by Clio Barnard for The Arbor, the imaginative telling of the life of Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar (writer of Rita, Sue and Bob Too) who died in 1990 aged 29. The actor Joanne Froggatt, a TV regular last seen as sensible housemaid Anna in Downton Abbey, was named most promising newcomer for In Our Name, in which she plays a British soldier returning from a traumatic stint in Iraq. Other award winners at the Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon-sponsored event included Enemies of the People \u2013 which tells the true story of Cambodia's Killing Fields \u2013 being named best documentary; a film called Baby, which took best short; and French prison drama A Prophet, which won the best foreign independent film award. Special prizes were given to Bonham Carter, who won the Richard Harris award for outstanding contribution by an actor to British film and Liam Neeson, who won the Variety Award and agent Jenne Casarotto, who won the special jury prize."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
