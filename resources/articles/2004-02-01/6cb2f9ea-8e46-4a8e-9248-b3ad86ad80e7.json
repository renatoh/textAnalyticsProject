In a team peppered with well-worn footballers, the miles on Rae's 34-year-old clock have been notably hard-travelled. He has been relegated at Sunderland, Millwall and Falkirk. To drop once can break a player's spirit; three times seems pointed malevolence on the part of the fates. \"Going down is not a very nice feeling, I can tell you,\" he says, \"though for me the worst time in my career was missing out on promotion with Sunderland after a penalty shoot- out after we had finished miles ahead of anyone else in third place [First Division 1997-98]. \"The Leicester game is a massive fixture for us and we're very fired up for it. It won't be easy because Leicester are a very physical side who score a lot of goals from set plays and corners.\" Leicester do not have fond memories of the reverse fixture at Wolves in October when they led 3-0 before losing 4-3. For Rae, though, the relegation net spreads wider. \"Leicester and Leeds are below us. But above us, Portsmouth, Everton and Blackburn are all very much in the fight to stay up. There are six of us.\" Wolves are a point ahead of Leicester; neither can afford to blink. At home, where they beat Manchester United and drew with Liverpool in the space of four days last month, Wolves have displayed a fortress mentality. Their travels, by comparison, have been a succession of fiascos - three points gained from a possible 39. \"Our home form has been very solid but it's not enough, on its own, to keep us up and we must do more away, starting at Leicester,\" says Rae, whose form in midfield represents one of the main reasons for optimism among the club's supporters. Having survived, both personally and professionally, the traumas of alcoholism, he says his \"door is always open for any player who has similar problems\". But his team-mates are more likely to come calling for relegation counselling. Wolves have been menaced since starting the season with a 5-1 defeat at Blackburn followed by a 4-0 reverse against Charlton in front of their own supporters the following week. \"We've been propping up the table since day one,\" says Rae with a shrug. \"If we are relegated it will be terribly disappointing for everyone involved but if we stay up it will be a magnificent achievement. \"From the start of the season we faced 38 cup ties because, financially, we are not in a position to compete with the clubs at the top of the table. We may be a big club in terms of history but we're really one of the small potatoes in the league.\" History is bunk at Wolves. Half a century ago they were led by their most famous manager, Stan Cullis, and their most decorated player, William Ambrose Wright, whose statues stand, black and mourning, beside the new stadium. Now the giant is not so much sleeping as narcoleptic. Having dallied in the First Division for an aeon while Sir Jack Hayward threw millions at a succession of managers, they have been languishing on the Premiership floor for most of the current campaign. At the Grand Theatre in Lichfield Street, just down the road from Molineux, Tommy Steele is starring in Scrooge this week. The club need to show a similar instinct for survival but, whether Wolves survive or go down, the manager Dave Jones faces some rebuilding posers with Rae, Denis Irwin and Paul Ince all moving towards the end of their careers. Irwin, in particular, is unlikely to play beyond this season and Rae implies that another term in the First Division is not high on his own wish list either. \"The First Division is more physically demanding,\" he says. \"You play more matches, for one thing, but the actual football takes more out of you. \"In the Premiership, where it's more a Saturday to Saturday thing, the skill factor is so much more important.\" And Rae has never been short on skill. For 14 years now he has been a such a consistent and creative midfield force in English football that the only surprise is that he has not made his name in the full Scotland side after captaining the Under-21 team. \"I watched the recent game against Wales, where we were beaten 4-0, and it was a shock,\" he says. \"With all respect to Wales they are hardly a top-notch side. Like everyone else, I'm sure, I feel I could do better than that. And this season I've enjoyed my football as much as ever.\" The smart money is on Rae making a return to his native Glasgow at the end of the season. He owns four properties there and also has a share of a taxi business in the city, which he visits regularly. He is out of contract and would be a natural target for Rangers, where he started his career. There, at least, relegation would not be an issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
