When we get dressed, we tell people all sorts of things about ourselves, some obvious and some more tenderly private. And yet our sartorial semaphore receives little close attention. Writing about clothes generally means fashion writing \u2013 and fashion writing, whose engine is commerce, cares mostly for novelty. It understands \u2013 or assumes \u2013 that you might want this season\u2019s dress. But it isn\u2019t really interested in emotions that run deeper than covetousness and vanity; in the pain you still feel across your heart, say, when you remember your grandmother\u2019s evening bag, left in a taxi when your mind and hands were elsewhere. Shahidha Bari\u2019s Dressed, then, should have been purest catnip for me, the kind of book I\u2019ve longed for half my life. Its high-minded intentions are obvious even before you open it: thanks to her publisher, which has been generous, it is more than elegant enough to inhabit one of those fashion emporiums for the thinking woman where hardbacks slyly cosy up to the latest trainers and piles of white T-shirts. In her introduction, moreover, Bari makes some pretty grand claims, writing that she would like to put aside the \u201cdistracting questions\u201d of what constitutes fashion, replacing them with what she calls \u201ca kind of philosophy of dress\u201d. For her, there exists the possibility that clothes can be understood as \u201cideas\u201d, and that in their comprehension it might be possible to understand the world \u201cin firmer, felt truths\u201d. One gathers, reading on, that she is not talking here about control pants. But what is she talking about, exactly? To be truthful, I am unable to summarise her arguments for the simple reason that I\u2019m not sure she has any. Her book consists largely of long, rather overworked accounts of paintings, films and novels in which certain clothes appear \u2013 the dress worn by Ariadne as imagined by Titian, say, or the suits favoured by Patrick Bateman in American Psycho \u2013 which are then analysed with recourse to, among others, Roland Barthes, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Derrida and Freud. On and on this goes to the point where you barely widen your eyes, let alone snigger, when a ballet dancer\u2019s pointe is described as \u201ca phallus, a quivering responsiveness\u2026 ever erect\u201d by one of the sources cited in the book, the critic Susan Leigh Foster. (See also: the handbag as a womb.) I suppose there are people who are still in thrall to this sort of thing; it\u2019s not Bari\u2019s fault that I cured myself of literary theory long ago \u2013 though it would be tricky even to parody what she has to say, in the section devoted to bags, about secrets (\u201cWhen we decide to reserve our secrets for ourselves, turning to taciturnity, we hold something back, keep it even\u2026\u201d). But my real problem with Dressed hasn\u2019t to do with its thinking. It\u2019s more a matter of tone. Sometimes, we get a glimpse of the richer, more exciting book it might have been: when Bari describes the \u201cbeastly\u201d origins of muslin, say, which was traditionally carded from cotton plants using the jawbone of a catfish, or when she reminds us of what Simone de Beauvoir said in The Second Sex about adolescent girls (\u201ctorn between the wish and the refusal to display\u201d). For the most part, however, Bari is interested neither in history, nor in talking to other people (she has, so far as I can see, done no interviews at all). Her voice is entirely unmodulated, her words steadily piling up, like balled tights in a crowded sock drawer. She never makes jokes, nor is she moved to anger, not even when talking about the more grotesque designs of Alexander McQueen; the snippets of memoir she serves up at the beginning of each chapter are smaller than Lucy Locket\u2019s pocket, and so coy that I am still not sure they are memoir. She is seemingly as afraid of judgment as she is of questions of taste and class \u2013 aspects of clothes that seem unignorable and vital to me. I understand that she isn\u2019t interested in fashion, per se. But still, Diana Vreeland, a dash of whose daffy wit she could really use sometimes, and even that great genius Balenciaga, make not a single appearance between them. The search for a smart book about clothes, I\u2019m afraid, goes on. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to clarify that it was a source cited in the book, not Bari, who wrote the description, quoted in this review, of a ballet dancer\u2019s pointe. \u2022 Dressed: The Secret Life of Clothes by Shahidha Bari is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a325).
