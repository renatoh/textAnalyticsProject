He knows the situation is virtually hopeless but those still mesmerised by the team's comeback in the Premiership a year ago may need to be snapped out of their trance. The facts should make for a rude awakening. If history were to repeat itself exactly it would still not be good enough to make United champions. Last season, Ferguson's men were in a delirium of conviction that brought nine wins and a draw from their closing 10 games. Over the same period, the then anguished Highbury side slithered through five wins, three draws and two defeats. If, against all expectation, those events were to recur, they would not be sufficient for United to close the 12-point gap. There will probably be no meaningful chase whatsoever and should there be one it is likelier to be Chelsea who move on to the shoulder of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side. Ferguson was already steeling himself for failure before United's 4-1 defeat at Manchester City. \"Somebody recently said that, in modern sport, you won't get a team dominating for more than seven years,\" he said in an interview last week. \"We've had our share for 14 years, but all those trophies have also been interspersed with barren years.\" It must be tough for Ferguson, at 62, to find that another fresh start is required. United have not disintegrated. With better finishing and greater luck they might have held a justifiable 4-2 lead over City by half-time. The trouble is that Ferguson's team are already inferior to Arsenal and, depending on the progress of the Stamford Bridge project, may be left behind by Chelsea as well. The Scot has good cause to lambast his defence, but he is also indulging in his favourite diversionary tactic. People might dwell on those complaints and overlook the wider areas of concern. There is, for instance, no orchestrator of the midfield and United became vapid after the interval on Sunday once City adopted some rudimentary defensive tactics. Roy Keane will return in a couple of weeks, but the 32-year-old has been frank about the effect of a hip operation and is probably saying his slow goodbye. Nicky Butt has not been Ferguson's preferred choice in the centre of the pitch this season, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's eligibility to replace David Beckham is in doubt now that, at 31, he has to follow a special fitness regime to aid a damaged knee, and, as a lesser nuisance, Ryan Giggs's form has diminished just as the season reaches its crescendo. It has all been enough to revive a grievance. United might well have been galvanised by Ronaldinho but the Brazilian preferred Barcelona, who were not even in the Champions League. It rankles with Ferguson that his club were outmanoeuvred or outbid and he blames the man who has since become Chelsea's chief executive. \"Peter Kenyon didn't get the job done,\" he said in last week's interview. There have been plenty of signings at Old Trafford, however, and the main problem for the manager must be that the rebuilding so far does not seem to be raising a great edifice. Although Cristiano Ronaldo showed pluck as well as flair against City, the general course of United's programme of rejuvenation is still not certain. A fee that may yet touch \u00a33m looks disproportionate for David Bellion. Louis Saha will have to justify a far greater outlay than that and his arrival was a tacit admission that the purchase of Diego Forlan has not succeeded as Ferguson wished. Eric Djemba-Djemba and Kleberson have much to do in their second season to correct the impression that they are no more than tolerable deputies to Keane. Ferguson has already started his reconstruction, but there is ambivalence about the outcome. Honourable as Darren Fletcher's efforts have been, it does not look as if the manager can turn confidently to the youth system as he did when boldly promoting Beckham, Giggs, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers en masse. Anyone who could bring in Eric Cantona has an eye for a signing, but the recruitment of players is a difficult business with unreliable results. Ferguson's achievements have often been delivered by players who developed close to him and even his Aberdeen team that won the 1983 Cup Winners' Cup was largely home-grown. John Magnier and JP McManus are pressing for more frugality at Old Trafford, and the nature of Ferguson's closing years as a manager may be decided by the success of his next ventures into the treacherous domain of the transfer market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
