With the wall at 7ft 2in, William Whitaker, 19, the outright winner here last year, cleared it with apparent ease on Leonardo. Then Ellen Whitaker's horse, Ladina, hit it quite hard. Remarkably the wall stayed up, so she shared first prize with her cousin. Ireland's Cian O'Connor, the rider who had his individual Olympic gold medal from Athens withdrawn after his horse, Waterford Crystal, failed a dope test, won yesterday afternoon's big class, the Christmas Cracker, worth \u00a34,500, with Aileen Bryan's Rancorrado. In a competitive 14-horse jump-off O'Connor, 29, steered the \"very adjustable\" but big-striding 17.3 hands gelding around the twisty course in an impressive 31.90 seconds, nearly a second faster than second-placed Philippe le Jeune, 48, from Belgium, to gain his first win at Olympia. Ben Maher, 25, was Britain's best-placed rider, taking third on Robin Hood with a clear round in 33.17sec."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
