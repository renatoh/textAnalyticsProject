Emmanuel Dennis is a 21-year-old striker currently plying his trade at Belgian outfit Club Brugge and made headlines by scoring a brace against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u just over a month ago. Rodgers is an admirer and hopes to bring him to the Premier League. Real Sociedad central defender Diego Llorente is also inching his way across the Leicester radar, while Tottenham and West Ham are also in the race to secure the \u00a345m-rated 26-year-old\u2019s scrawl. Wolfsburg striker Wout Weghorst is wanted by Crystal Palace, who are finding goals hard to come by despite their position in the top half of the table. Averaging less than a goal per game, Jordan Ayew is currently their top scorer with three, while Christian Benteke has scored just twice for his club since April 2018. With the future of Granit Xhaka at Arsenal in doubt following all that recent unpleasantness, AC Milan could offer the Swiss international a fresh start, if reports from Italy are to be believed. Stripped of the captaincy by Unai Emery, Xhaka has stopped short of apologising for his angry reaction to being jeered, scapegoated and bullied by the entitled masses at the Emirates while being subbed off during his most recent appearance for the club. Increasingly surplus to requirements at Chelsea due to the emergence of various prominent members of Lampard Youth, the days of old-timers Pedro, Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud at Stamford Bridge are looking numbered. Turkish side Fenerbah\u00e7e are interested in taking Pedro, who has also attracted interest from the Chinese Super League. Giroud, who has made no secret of his displeasure at the lack of first team action he\u2019s been given this season, is understood to have admirers at Crystal Palace and West Ham, but could also make a triumphant return to France. Following his half-time withdrawal against Ajax, who targeted him with great success on Tuesday night, Alonso could also find himself looking for new employers, not least because Emerson has finally returned from the treatment room after six weeks out. Manchester United are keeping tabs on Burnley midfielder Dwight McNeil, who they had on their books as a kid only to let him go when he was 14. Having watched the midfielder develop into one of the Premier League\u2019s most exciting homegrown talents under Sean Dyche, they will have to pay the thick end of \u00a340m to bring him back to Old Trafford. And finally, the delightful prospect of seeing Ars\u00e9ne Wenger gadding about in Lederhosen and a Tyrolean hat while supping frothy lager from a stein seems increasingly less preposterous, following reports that Bayern Munich are ready to offer the 70-year-old their vacant manager\u2019s job until the end of the season. With Niko Kovac having been unceremoniously ushered through the door marked \u201cAusfahrt\u201d, the Sun says the German champions have made an approach to Wenger, although The Athletic\u2019s Raphael Honigstein claims the former Arsenal manager is not on the club\u2019s shortlist of potential replacements. Wenger, for his part, says he would very much like to be considered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
