We\u2019ll be back with you early in the new year. Donald Trump plans to withdraw all US troops from Syria, according to multiple reports. There are about 2,000 troops there, tasked with training local forces to fight ISIS. Trump declared that ISIS has been defeated, a proposition disputed by many experts. Lawmakers including senior Republicans criticized the withdrawal decision. A government shutdown appears to be off. The Senate is introducing a temporary spending bill that will keep the government funded at current levels until February. It does not contain money for Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, but the White House has indicated he\u2019ll accept it anyway - though nothing is for sure until the famously unpredictable president signs his name to the bill. Trump lashed out a day after agreeing to dissolve his charitable foundation, accused of widespread legal violations by the New York attorney general. Trump ripped into the current attorney general, the previous one, and the one who will take office next year, insisting all three officials are treating him unfairly. Don\u2019t forget, you can sign up to our new US morning briefing for a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads every weekday. White House officials in a phone briefing with reporters could not give a timeline for the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. The White House referred questions to the Pentagon, per a Newsday reporter. And the Pentagon referred the same questions to the White House. Two prominent Senate Democrats wrote to the chamber\u2019s leaders opposing a proposal to ban US companies from boycotting Israel. Some lawmakers have tried to include the bill - which would prohibit American companies from participating in boycotts organized by international organizations like the United Nations - in year-end spending measures. But Senators Bernie Sanders and Dianne Feinstein said in a letter to leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer that it should not be included. \u201cWhile we do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis bill would violate Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d Some conservative lawmakers are not happy with a developing deal to avoid a government shutdown and continue government funding until February - without money for Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. The number of people signing up for health insurance plans under Obamacare is higher than expected, although down since last year. About 8.5 million people have enrolled, the Associated Press reports. That\u2019s a 4% decline compared to this time last year. Earlier projections had predicted a 10% decline. A Texas judge last week declared the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, but it remains in effect for the time being. Donald Trump claims the US has defeated ISIS in Syria, but has it? The Guardian\u2019s Martin Chulov takes a look at that question: The long fight against Islamic State looks good on a map, but it is yet to be decisive on the battlefield. The terror group has lost more than 95% of the territory it claimed in 2014 and the juggernaut that threatened to shred the region\u2019s borders has been battered back to where it all began for the group\u2019s earliest incarnation \u2013 a sliver of land along the Euphrates River, bordering Iraq and Syria. There, Kurdish-led forces, backed by US air support, have been fighting it out with diehard extremists in towns and villages in Syria\u2019s far eastern Deir ez-Zor province. At least 2,500 Isis fighters remain, all survivors of routs to the east and west of their last redoubt. Colossal ruin lays in their wake on both sides of the river. But the group retains the capacity to do even more damage, especially if let off the hook now. After voting to raise interest rates despite criticism from Donald Trump, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says \u201cnothing will deter\u201d the board from doing what he thinks is right. More Republican opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria: Senator Marco Rubio calls it a \u201cmajor blunder\u201d that will haunt the US for years. Donald Trump will sign a temporary bill to continue federal funding at current levels and avoid a government shutdown, a Republican senator told CNN after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. The Federal Reserve has voted to raise interest rates. Rates will raise a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. The move becomes despite frequent exhortations from Donald Trump not to raise rates. \u201cThe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. \u201cJob gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.\u201d Read more in our business blog. More from House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s farewell speech, via Bloomberg - he calls overhauling programs like Medicare and Social Security, long a pet issue but one that made no progress under his tenure, his great unfinished business. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer will not agree to approve a customary year-end package of judicial nominees, a Senate Democratic aide tells the Hill. Schumer has been under pressure from progressive groups not to sign off on the judges. \u201cEspecially in light of the Texas judge\u2019s ruling last week ruling ObamaCare unconstitutional, it would be insane to continue to give a free pass to lower-court judges that are ideologically extreme,\u201d Brian Fallon, a former aide to Schumer who is now the executive director of Demand Justice, told the Hill. In a farewell speech, House Speaker Paul Ryan called for immigration reform that would protect young immigrants brought to the country as children as well as other undocumented immigrants. There should be a solution that \u201cincludes the Dreamers, those who came here through no fault of their own, and ultimately the undocumented population,\u201d he said, according to CNN. He called such an overhaul \u201can economic and moral imperative. And it would go a long way toward taking some of the venom out of our discourse.\u201d Attorneys for the family of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in border patrol custody called for an independent investigation into the death Wednesday. \u201cThe investigation should not be the exclusive purview of the agencies whose actions and policies are being questioned. The investigator should not be the same entity as the investigated,\u201d lawyer Enrique Moreno said at an El Paso press conference, NBC News reported. Neither the girl nor her father, Nery Gilberto Caal Cuz, were given water during their confinement, another lawyer said - contradicting statements by the Department of Homeland Security that they had access to food and water. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will not be changing its name after all. Kathy Kraninger, the bureau\u2019s new director, decided to reverse course and keep the name the same, Politico reported. Her predecessor Mick Mulvaney, now acting White House chief of staff, wanted to change it to Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. \u201cI care much more about what we do than what we are called,\u201d Kraninger in an email to staff, obtained by the consumer group Allied Progress. \u201cAs of December 17, 2018, I have officially halted all ongoing efforts to make changes to existing products and materials related to the name correction initiative.\u201d South Carolina may skip holding a 2020 presidential primary and put its support behind Donald Trump without a vote. \u201cWe have complete autonomy and flexibility in either direction,\u201d South Carolina Republican chairman Drew McKissick told the Washington Examiner. \u201cConsidering the fact that the entire party supports the president, we\u2019ll end up doing what\u2019s in the president\u2019s best interest.\u201d The primary is traditionally thirds in the nation and hard fought among presidential contenders. Former vice president Joe Biden has the highest favorability rating among potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, with 53% of voters viewing him favorably and 33% unfavorably, according to a new poll. Among the ratings for other contenders in the Quinnipiac University poll: A divided 44 - 42 percent favorability for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, including 74 - 13 percent among Democrats and 57 - 29 percent among voters 18 to 34 years old; 24 - 20 percent for Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, with 55 percent who haven\u2019t heard enough about him to form an opinion; Negative 30 - 37 percent for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; 22 - 26 percent for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, with 51 percent who haven\u2019t heard enough; Negative 22 - 32 percent for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; A divided 20 - 22 percent for California Sen. Kamala Harris, with 57 percent who haven\u2019t heard enough; 14 - 17 percent for New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, with 68 percent who haven\u2019t heard enough; 12 - 9 percent for Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, with 77 percent who haven\u2019t heard enough. The Washington, D.C. attorney general filed a lawsuit against Facebook over the scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of data from the social media site. \u201cFacebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was used,\u201d Attorney General Karl Racine in a statement, according to Reuters. \u201cFacebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users\u2019 permission.\u201d The D.C. attorney general says in the suit that this exposed nearly half of the district\u2019s residents\u2019 data to manipulation for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election, Reuters reported. Cambridge Analytica at one point worked for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The AG charged Facebook\u2019s \u201clax oversight and misleading privacy settings\u201d had allowed the firm to access the data. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull US forces out of Syria follows a phone call with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan on Friday where he agreed to do so, Reuters reported. \u201cEverything that has followed is implementing the agreement that was made in that call,\u201d a US official told the news agency. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says her caucus will support a continuing resolution to fund the government into the new year and avert a partial government shutdown. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tore into a Politico article she did not like, criticizing it on the basis that it used unnamed sources. Now her comments are providing fuel for Donald Trump Jr., who sees some similarities with his father\u2019s grievances against the press. The story in question reported that Ocasio-Cortez was looking at backing a primary challenge against a fellow New York Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries. Her spokesman, who was quoted in the story, did not deny it, but she has since said on Twitter it is untrue. All US State Department staff will be withdrawn from Syria in the next 24 hours, per Reuters. The move comes as the Trump administration is planning to withdraw US troops from the country. Senators Jeff Flake, Cory Booker and Chris Coons will attempt to force a vote this afternoon on a bill to protect the job of special counsel Robert Mueller, per NBC. Flake, an Arizona Republican who will leave office at the end of the year, has been holding up judicial nominations in an effort to get a vote on the legislation. In addition to shutting down, Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation will have to sell off its property under a deal with the New York Attorney General. That property consists of exactly three objects, per the Washington Post\u2019s David Fartenhold. One of them is a Denver Broncos helmet signed by ex-quarterback Tim Tebow, which Trump bought using foundation money. The other two are large portraits of Trump, which he also purchased with foundation money. A federal judge has struck down most of the Trump administration\u2019s policy to make it more difficult for immigrants to claim asylum, per Buzzfeed. The policy, by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, tightened the standard required to demonstrate \u201ccredible fear,\u201d the first hurdle to begin the asylum process. The ruling is from Judge Emmet Sullivan, the same judge who presided over former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s delayed sentencing Tuesday. Congressional Democrats will investigate how the White House handles security clearances when they take control of the House next month. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the incoming chair of the House Oversight committee, sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly asking for documents related to the White House security clearance process. The documents were requested on three previous occasions, but not turned over, he wrote. \u201cThese are documents that even the Republicans on the Oversight Committee\u2014at least at some point in time\u2014believed we needed to conduct effective oversight, but when the Trump Administration refused to comply fully, the Republicans would not issue a single subpoena,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cMany of these requests were bipartisan, and some are now more than a year old. As Democrats prepare to take the reins in Congress, we are insisting\u2014as a basic first step\u2014that the Trump Administration and others comply with these Republican requests.\u201d Another Republican Congressman is disputing Donald Trump\u2019s claim that ISIS has been defeated in Syria, used to justify his decision to withdraw US troops from the country. \u201cThis is simply not true,\u201d said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican and Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cReally? Iran is rejoicing right now,\u201d he said of the decision to withdraw. \u201cWe left Iraq, and had to come back. I would sure hope the President and his advisers are smarter than this.\u201d A spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood says she \u201cbelieves there should be one set of rules for everyone,\u201d after being targeted in attacks by Donald Trump. The statement comes after Trump unleashed a Twitter rant against Underwood, without naming her, also tearing into her predecessor and successor as attorney general. Trump said he was treated unfairly after he agreed to a deal to dissolve his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, which was accused of a series of legal violations. \u201cPresident Trump should know that the NY Attorney General who sued the Trump Foundation is Barbara Underwood,\u201d said the AG\u2019s spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. \u201cBarbara Underwood is a career prosecutor who served as U.S. Solicitor General, clerked for Thurgood Marshall, and has argued before the Supreme Court 20 times,\u201d she said. \u201cAG Underwood believes there should be one set of rules for everyone - no matter who they are. That\u2019s why she filed suit against the Trump Foundation, after an investigation found a shocking pattern of flagrant and repeated illegality - including willful self-dealing to serve Mr. Trump and his business and political interests.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirms the US has begun withdrawing troops from Syria, but says they are ready to \u201cre-engage\u201d as necessary. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer points out that Mexico is still not paying for Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. Trump has claimed that through a revised trade agreement between the US and Mexico, Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall. The White House has been unable to explain how this is supposed to work. Experts have found no conceivable way it could happen. Senator Rand Paul is welcoming the decision by Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from Syria. The Pentagon is pushing to keep troops in Syria despite Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw them, according to a reporter for the Daily Beast. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is answering questions behind closed doors Wednesday from House committees probing the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. She\u2019s likely to be asked about the extent of oversight she had over those probes as attorney general under President Barack Obama, as well as whether an anti-Trump bias affected any investigative decisions, the Washington Post reported. Lynch\u2019s testimony comes days after former FBI director James Comey appeared before the panels, also in a closed-door session. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is condemning the Trump administration\u2019s move to withdraw US troops from Syria. \u201cWithdrawal of this small American force in Syria would be a huge Obama-like mistake,\u201d Graham said in a tweet. Contrary to Donald Trump\u2019s claim, Graham said that ISIS has not been defeated in the country. \u201cISIS is not defeated in Syria, Iraq, and after just returning from visiting there -- certainly not Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cA decision to withdraw will also be viewed as a boost to ISIS desire to come back.\u201d Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell will introduce a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded through February 8, he announced Wednesday. McConnell said: \u201cLater this morning, we\u2019ll introduce a continuing resolution that will ensure continuous funding for the federal government. The measure will provide the resources necessary to continue normal operations through February 8th.\u201d He went on: \u201cIt seems like political spite for the president may be winning out over sensible policy -- even sensible policies that are more modest than border security allocations which many Democrats supported themselves, in the recent past. But faced with this intransigence -- with Democrats\u2019 failure to take our borders seriously -- Republicans will continue to fulfill our duty to govern. That\u2019s why we will soon take up a simple measure that will continue government funding into February: So we can continue this vital debate after the new Congress has convened.\u201d Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday after agreeing to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, in a deal with the New York attorney general. Attorney General Barbara Underwood alleged \u201ca shocking pattern of illegality,\u201d at the foundation, including illicit coordination with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and the use of charity funds to pay off legal settlements by Trump\u2019s business. \u201cThe Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc.,\u201d Trump said in a tweet Wednesday. \u201cNow, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by........sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics.\u201d Former AG Eric Schneiderman resigned in May after allegations he had physically abused women he dated. He was replaced by Underwood. Letitia James, now the New York City public advocate, was elected attorney general in November. \u201cShady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cIn any event, it goes on and on &amp; the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave &amp; politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of \u2018justice.\u2019\u201d Underwood\u2019s spokeswoman responded on Twitter: Donald Trump is insisting that the military will build his proposed border wall if he doesn\u2019t get money from Congress, as he appears prepared to back down from his demand that wall funding be included in an upcoming budget bill. Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S.,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cBecause of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!\u201d Trump had promised during his campaign that he would build a wall and get Mexico to pay for it. He has instead sought US taxpayer money for the wall, while pushing the dubious assertion that a revised trade pact between the two countries constitutes Mexico indirectly paying for it. The backup plan he has floated to have the military do the construction would be legally complicated and likely face challenges. The White House may be ready to accept a short term bill to extend government funding and avoid a government shutdown. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Wednesday that Trump would \u201ccertainly\u201d consider a short-term extension, the Washington Post reported. Trump had been demanding that $5bn in funding for a border wall be included in any spending bill, which must be passed by Friday night to avoid a partial government shutdown. Senate Republicans have begun drafting a short term bill that would extend government funding at current levels until February. The United States is preparing for a \u201cfull\u201d and \u201crapid\u201d withdrawal of troops from Syria, CNN reports. Withdrawal is favored by Donald Trump, who has called for the US to stay out of Syria. There are currently about 2,000 US troops in the country, mostly training local forces to fight ISIS. Trump claimed in a tweet Wednesday that ISIS has been defeated in the country and that combating the terrorist group was the only reason for a US presence in Syria. Former First Lady Michelle Obama explained what was going through her mind as she departed Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration last year: \u201cBye, Felicia.\u201d Obama, appearing on \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d was asked about her thoughts in a photo where she and her husband Barack Obama boarded a jet to leave Washington. \u201cA lot was going on that day. That was a day,\u201d Obama said. Her much-watched facial expressions the day of the inauguration channeled the feelings of many opponents of Donald Trump, who couldn\u2019t quite grasp that the bombastic billionaire was ascending to the presidency. She has said she \u201cstopped even trying to smile\u201d during the ceremony. \u201cAnd right before that, my daughter\u2019s friends decided they needed a sleepover for the last day. I was like, are you guys kidding me? We\u2019re leaving. You gotta take all your stuff, pick it up, the blankets, the bears - they\u2019re all crying, and it was like, get out, we gotta go.\u201d Obama was also befuddled to receive a gift from Tiffany\u2019s from incoming first lady Michelle Obama, another memorable facial expression caught on camera. \u201cSo there was that, and then the Tiffany\u2019s box - it was just all, you know, a lot,\u201d she said. Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that the president signed a \u201cbullshit\u201d letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. Giuliani made the comments to the New York Daily News - just days after saying on CNN that Trump did not sign the letter. In his latest remarks, he said Trump signed it but never intended to act on it. He said that \u201cof course\u201d Trump signed it but that it was \u201cbullshit\u201d because it never went anywhere. \u201cThat was the end of it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt means nothing but an expression of interest that means very little unless it goes to a contract and it never did.\u201d On CNN Sunday, Giuliani falsely said that \u201cno one signed\u201d the letter. A copy of the document obtained by the network carries Trump\u2019s signature. Outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan is set to deliver a farewell speech Wednesday at the Library of Congress. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, announced earlier this year that he would not run for re-election. Democrats are set to take control of the House next month. Ryan plans to bemoan America\u2019s \u201cbroken politics,\u201d according to excerpts of the speech obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cOur complex problems are solvable,\u201d he plans to say. \u201cThat is to say, our problems are solvable if our politics will allow it.\u201d He also calls the failure to overhaul federal benefits programs \u201cour greatest unfinished business.\u201d A day after the White House indicated that it may back down on demands for $5bn for a border wall in order to avoid a government shutdown, Donald Trump is vowing to win on the issue - someday. \u201cIn our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in a tweet. \u201cWe won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!\u201d The House returns to session Wednesday with two days left to pass spending bills and avoid a partial shutdown. Senate Republicans are drafting a short term measure that would keep the government funded at current levels until Feb. 8, CNN reported. Tuesday night, Trump weighed in on the aesthetics of the proposed wall, which he said would be built of steel slats rather than concrete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
