Vicky Thompson, 21, was being held at Armley, a category B men\u2019s prison in Leeds, where she was pronounced dead last Friday, it was announced on Thursday. The news has been greeted with anger on Twitter with campaigners and MPs expressing their dismay. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called for the law to be reformed urgently while Labour\u2019s Cat Smith, the shadow minister for women and equalities, described the news of Thompson\u2019s death as \u201cdevastating\u201d. Smith asked Michael Gove, the justice secretary, for clarification on the procedures for transgender prisoners in parliament on 3 November following the widespread attention Tara Hudson\u2019s case attracted after transgender activists successfully campaigned to have her relocated from a men\u2019s prison. She said: \u201cGiven that I raised it quite recently with the Tara Hudson case, it\u2019s devastating the issue has come back again so quickly but with tragic circumstances. The reality is that sending women into men\u2019s prison to serve sentences would shatter even the strongest person. \u201cThe guidelines [on where to send transgender prisoners] are either not being implemented properly or they are not fit for purpose and I intend to find out which it is,\u201d she added. \u201cIt must have been terrifying to be driven into a men\u2019s prison after living her whole adult life as a woman. But we\u2019ll never get to hear Vicky\u2019s testimony of what it was like in there for her.\u201d Thompson, who had been handed a 12-month jail term in August, suspended for 24 months, was remanded in custody at Bradford crown court after breaching the terms of the sentence. She had been born male but identified as a woman from her mid-teens. She asked the judge presiding over the case to send her to New Hall women\u2019s prison near Wakefield, but her request was denied. Her solicitor, Mohammed Hussain, described Thompson, who had not undergone gender reassignment surgery, as a vulnerable transgender woman and told the judge she was \u201cessentially a woman\u201d. An investigation has been launched into her death. According to Ministry of Justice guidelines, all prisoners should be placed according to their gender \u201cas recognised by UK law\u201d, which is usually as stated on their birth certificate. If they have obtained a gender recognition certificate, a new birth certificate will have been issued. However, the rules also say some transgender people will be \u201csufficiently advanced in the gender reassignment process\u201d that they could be placed \u201cin the estate of their acquired gender, even if the law does not yet recognise they are of their acquired gender\u201d. In addition, a case conference must be convened and a multi-disciplinary risk assessment should be carried out to determine how best to manage a transgender prisoner\u2019s location. Thompson\u2019s boyfriend, Robert Steele, said he had spoken to her a day before she died. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like it in there because people were saying things to her because she was dressing as a female,\u201d he told the BBC. A spokesperson for the prison service said: \u201cHMP Leeds prisoner Vicky Thompson was found unresponsive on the evening of Friday 13 November. \u201cStaff and paramedics attempted resuscitation but she was pronounced dead at 20:48 GMT. As with all deaths in custody there will be an investigation by the independent prisons and probation ombudsman\u201d. West Yorkshire police said Thompson\u2019s death was not being treated as suspicious. The public reaction on Twitter has been largely angry with some blaming the Ministry of Justice for her death. Others pointed out that the news of Thompson\u2019s death has been announced during Transgender Awareness Week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
