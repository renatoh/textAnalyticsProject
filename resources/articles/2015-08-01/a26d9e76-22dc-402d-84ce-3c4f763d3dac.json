On TV, it would be a real candidate for boxset binge-watching, but maybe it\u2019s too hardcore for consumption on that scale: a grippingly brutal and unwatchably macabre forensic thriller, directed by Hans Herbots (who also directed episodes of Spiral) and adapted from Mo Hayden\u2019s 2001 crime bestseller \u2013 transplanted to Belgium from the original south London setting. Nick Cafmeyer (Geert Van Rampelberg) is a hardbitten cop who still lives in his boyhood home, from where his brother was abducted by a paedophile when they were children and never found. To add to this cold case, there is a new one: a child abuser called the Troll is now taking and imprisoning children along (temporarily) with their parents \u2013 and Cafmeyer comes to believe that the culprit is part of the same underground ring that included his brother\u2019s kidnapper. There is a nauseous twist or lurch halfway through that puts everything in a queasy new light. It is claustrophobic and disquieting, put over with gruesome conviction. A Hollywood remake set in the deep south can\u2019t be far off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
