Kushner, a senior adviser to the US president who is married to his daughter Ivanka, made a surprise appearance on the podium and said Trump had instructed him to \u201cbreak down every barrier needed to make sure the teams can succeed\u201d. Kushner added: \u201cThe president also wanted us to make sure that we think outside the box, make sure we\u2019re finding all the best thinkers in the country, making sure we\u2019re getting all the best ideas.\u201d But by way of example, Kushner said Trump became concerned about supply shortages after hearing about them \u201cjust this morning\u201d from \u201cfriends of his in New York\u201d \u2013 implying the president responds to anecdotes rather than the state governor or public health officials. \u201cWe went to the president today,\u201d Kushner continued. \u201cAnd earlier today, the president called Mayor [Bill] de Blasio to inform him that we are going to send a month of supply to New York public hospital system.\u201d The vice-president, Mike Pence, later said there would 200,000 masks sent to New York. Kushner said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we\u2019re constantly in communications with the local communities.\u201d Media reports have suggested that Kushner, a property developer with no medical expertise, is running a \u201cshadow taskforce\u201d \u2013 a rival power base that conflicts with the official task force led by Pence. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been serving really at the direction of the vice-president. He\u2019s asked me to get involved in different projects. The vice-president and I speak, probably, sometimes five, 10 times a day, but everything that I\u2019m doing is at the direction of the vice-president.\u201d He glanced over at Pence, who smiled benignly. Earlier on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, announced a new House committee would oversee \u201call aspects\u201d of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and did not rule out an investigation in the style of the commission on the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Such a prospect clearly stung Trump, who compared it to the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the congressional hearings into his dealings with Ukraine that led to his impeachment. \u201cThis is not the time for politics,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cEndless partisan investigations \u2013 here we go again \u2013 have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It\u2019s witch-hunt after witch-hunt after witch-hunt and, in the end, the people doing the witch-hunt have been losing, and they\u2019ve been losing by a lot. It\u2019s not any time for witch-hunts.\u201d Yet even as the president spoke, the White House was releasing a letter in which he assailed Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader from New York. \u201cThank you for your Democrat public relations letter and incorrect sound bites, which are wrong in every way,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers) and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy\u2019.\u201d Along with Kushner, Trump introduced Peter Navarro, the national Defense Production Act (DPA) policy coordinator. Navarro claimed there was a \u201cblack market springing up\u201d to drive up prices of protective gear, involving brokers and middle men. \u201cWe are going to crack down on the hoarders,\u201d he said. Navarro, a hardliner on trade, also used the opportunity claim the pandemic showed \u201cwe\u2019re over-dependent on a global supply chain\u201d and was a \u201cvindication\u201d of Trump\u2019s stance on buying American goods and strengthening borders. More than once he praised \u201cTrump time\u201d \u2013 shorthand for getting things done fast. Trump said he was again invoking the DPA to ensure parts were available for the mass production of ventilators. Adm John Polowczyk, in charge of the supply chain, said the federal government had now produced 22.4m pairs of protective gloves, 5.2m face shields and 7,600 ventilators. But distributing the supplies to the places most in need has been a problem. Trump became defensive under questioning, seeking to shift blame to individual states. Some were well prepared, he said, but \u201cin some cases their shelves were bare\u201d. He went on: \u201cBy the way, the states should have been building their stockpiles. We\u2019re a backup, we\u2019re not an ordering clerk. Whoever heard of a governor calling up the federal government and saying, \u2018Sir, we need a hospital?\u2019\u201d Trump also faced queries about the economy on a day that saw the number of people filing claims for unemployment benefits surge to a record of more than 6.6 million. He made the astonishing claim: \u201cI will always protect your social security, your Medicare and your Medicaid\u201d \u2013 despite having supported cuts in the past. The president announced that he had taken a second test for coronavirus and, like the first, it came back negative. The second test was much simpler and took about 15 minutes. \u201cI\u2019ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant,\u201d he said. America now has more than 236,000 confirmed cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins, the highest in the world, and more than 5,600 fatalities. Deborah Birx, the taskforce response coordinator, warned that Americans are not yet taking the risks seriously enough. \u201cI know you\u2019ve seen the slope in the United States vs the slope in Italy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to change that slope. We see country after country having done that. I can tell by the curve as it is today that not everyone is following the social distancing guidance. We can bend our curve, but everyone has to take responsibility as Americans.\u201d Earlier, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, rejected reports that some Americans might have to wait months for direct payments in the $2.2tn emergency rescue package stimulus package. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re hearing these things,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cI told you this would be three weeks; I\u2019m now committing to two weeks. We\u2019re delivering on our commitments to the IRS, which I oversee, within two weeks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
