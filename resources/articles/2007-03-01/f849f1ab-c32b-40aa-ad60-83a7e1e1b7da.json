In 1998, the Beta Band - the group the trio had formed with frontman Steve Mason - attained an almost hysterical pitch of critical acclaim and appeared to have the two biggest bands in the country under their spell. Noel Gallagher claimed to have been inspired to take Oasis in a more outr\u00e9 musical direction by the Beta Band's first three EPs, while Radiohead were reported to be indulging in Beta Band-influenced experimentation for their follow-up to OK Computer. You could see the attraction. By 1998, alt-rock had become constrained by Britpop's obsession with commercial success and limited frame of music reference. The Beta Band's esoteric melange of electronica, hip-hop, psychedelia and folk, on the other hand, suggested music could be a boundless world of possibilities. But while Radiohead and Oasis were paying homage, psychiatric problems had forced Anderson to quit: \"I was 10 long years in a mental asylum,\" as he puts it, with shattering candour, on the Aliens' debut album. Meanwhile, his former bandmates greeted the media with all the warmth of a stonefish and called their celebrity fans \"fuckwits\" (it's worth pointing out that they started doing this even before they'd heard Oasis' catastrophic Beta Band-influenced album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants). Worse, the seemingly bottomless well of musical inspiration began to run dry, resulting in albums on which every moment of indisputable brilliance was countered by a half-baked idea. By the time they split up in 2004, Mason was battling depression and working on a building site to make ends meet; he later quit music altogether. It's a sad story, so there's something indisputably cheering about Anderson, Jones and McLean releasing a single with the unironic title The Happy Song. Admittedly, the song is unlikely to make anyone else happy - it just sounds really annoying - but it's so nice to know that Anderson is feeling better and McLean and Jones have emerged unscathed from the wreckage of their former band that you feel a heel for pointing it out. Luckily, Astronomy for Dogs has more to offer than an upbeat coda to the Beta Band story. After leaving the Beta Band, Anderson released some intriguing albums under the name Lone Pigeon, on which the definition of a song was stretched to encompass musical fragments grouped together apparently at random, and given titles. One minute you got a recording of people rubbing the rims of wineglasses, the next an astonishing flare of songwriting, in thrall to both the whimsical wing of British psychedelia and Abbey Road-era Paul McCartney. Happily for those who applaud an artist's right to experiment but find their threshold for listening to people rub wineglasses unaccountably low, the Aliens' sound is rooted in the latter aspect of Lone Pigeon's oeuvre. As with the Beta Band, exploratory self-indulgence is rather the point of the Aliens, but here it's firmly anchored by fantastic songs. On She Don't Love Me No More, frosty piano tinkling gives way to a heartbroken ballad: after a few minutes, the piano takes over again, as if it can't cope with putting the misery into words. Robot Man seems to be an exercise in seeing how many musical signifiers of euphoria you can cram into three minutes - everything from Beach Boys harmonies to a piano house breakdown - but the melody is strong enough to support it. Tomorrow is a musical oxymoron, managing to sound like a lysergically altered version of the pre-pot Beatles: if someone had invaded the session for 'Til There Was You bearing a bag of suspicious sugarcubes, this might have been the result. The forgiveable misstep of The Happy Song aside, only the closing Caravan slips its moorings, resulting in 12 minutes of formless jamming that, like all formless jamming, was undoubtedly more fun to record than it is to listen to. While we're dwelling on the negative, there's also something a little off about the lyrics, which seem obsessed with female perfidy. They tend to address the entirety of womankind with a dismissive, paranoid \"they\", as in \"they come into your life and walk away\" or \"don't rely on them for love\". Listen too closely, and they start to resemble not songwords but evidence gathered in the hope of securing a restraining order. It's unfortunate, but then again, there's enough going on musically that you don't have to listen too closely to the lyrics; so much, in fact, that Astronomy for Dogs seems less like a happy ending to the Beta Band saga than a fascinating new beginning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
