The coastguard has so far failed to break through to the vessel. The Canadian coastguard has been working for the past 48 hours to free the MV Blue Puttees, said Darrell Mercer, a spokesman for Marine Atlantic, the company that runs ferries to the peninsula. But the fleet\u2019s largest icebreaker, the Louis S St Laurent, has so far failed to free the Puttees from the dense ice. \u201cThe ice conditions that we\u2019re facing this year are among the worst that we\u2019ve seen in 30 years,\u201d Mercer told the Guardian on Friday, adding that in bad years \u201cthe thickness of the ice is up to 25 feet\u201d. But Mercer said the coastguard has hopes that the wind will shift on Friday evening and loosen the ice\u2019s frigid grip. \u201cWhen the winds shift we start to get what they call a raft rink, and it layers the ice and gets thicker and thicker. We\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll get some better winds today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive news is they\u2019re making some headway this afternoon,\u201d he said, \u201cand hopefully they\u2019ll be into the port in the next few hours.\u201d The Canadians on board, who have spent the past two days stuck on a ship that is itself stuck in a barren field of thick ice between Cape Breton and Newfoundland, are handling their time in purgatory well, Mercer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in constant contact with the vessel, and everybody\u2019s in good spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of food and supplies on board, we have been providing amenities, and they recognize the situation that they\u2019re at sea a lot longer than we had planned.\u201d Passengers are spending the time as best they can, he said, playing cards and eating well. Wayne Elliott, a truck driver and passenger on the Puttees, told CBC he was content: \u201cThey are feeding us for free, so we\u2019re good.\u201d Every winter, crews traveling northern climes ready their vessels for ice conditions that could entomb a ship, but a few inevitably must wait for the coastguard to free them. On Tuesday another Marine Atlantic ferry, the MV Highlanders, became trapped in the ice with 190 people on board. The Louis S St Laurent was able to help it free after several hours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
