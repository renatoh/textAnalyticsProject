Heavy and, at times, indiscriminate gunfire produced scenes of chaos. Protest leaders surrendered and implored their supporters to give up and go home, to prevent a bloodbath, but soon lost control. Militants on the losing side, some of them armed, vented their rage by torching the stock exchange, banks, a department store complex, two pro-government newspapers and a television station. A negotiated settlement between the government and red-shirt protesters had almost been reached last week, but it was rejected in the same way in which the government turned down a further attempt at mediation this week. The bloody scenes yesterday made a nonsense of the government's claim that they were prepared to talk to the red-shirts after the camp had been cleared. It was total defeat for those who had paralysed the centre of Bangkok for six weeks and it is difficult to see what dialogue could now follow. Once a key military adviser to the red-shirts, the renegade general Khattiya Sawasdipol had been killed by a sniper on Monday, there was a sickening sense of inevitability about the final showdown. The military's show of force can only have deepened the tension between the two political camps. This is not a classic struggle between disenfranchised pro-democracy activists and an elite which ignores elections and regularly stages military coups. Behind the red-shirts looms the exiled Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister and oligarch deposed in a military coup, a man all too willing to urge his supporters to sacrifice their blood, without risking his own. Thaksin was a major force in the red-shirt camp but not the only one. Inevitably the protest attracted support from the urban as well as the rural poor. According to military estimates, 70% of the protesters came from Bangkok and its provinces, people far removed from farmers in the north and north-east regarded as Thaksin strongholds. And yes, it was also about the yawning democratic deficit, even though both the red-shirts and yellow-shirted People's Alliance for Democracy (who occupied the seat of government for three months and seized Bangkok's airports) have played fast and loose with that word. The dispersal of the red-shirt camp is a temporary victory for the government of prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. As the body counts mounts, and the eyewitness accounts of the shooting emerge, it will, alas, not be the last battle waged in this conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
