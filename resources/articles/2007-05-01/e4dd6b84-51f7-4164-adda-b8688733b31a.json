In his first match since splitting with his coach Tony Roche the Swiss did not serve well, was uncertain with the timing of his ground strokes and appeared at an emotional low as he struggled to survive in the Masters Series event against Juan Monaco, an Argentinian who has only just broken into the top 50. In his longest spell without winning a title since he became world No1 three years ago Federer had to save five break points in the final set of his unconvincing 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory. His form remains conspicuously moderate in what is now his last tournament before the French Open but this time at least there were plenty of valid excuses. The temperature had dropped, the tennis balls were uncomfortably heavy and rain noisily pummelled the roof, which meant it was an achievement that Federer was prepared to lower his sights and scrap just to get through. Asked if it had felt different without Roche, Federer answered obliquely: \"I just focused on the match and got the game plan right,\" he said. \"And tried to get used to the conditions. They are totally different and the good signs are that I really focused on how to play and how to adjust. That was not always the case last week.\" This suggested that the parting may have affected him but he was narrowing his mind to the present. Federer nevertheless surprised many by asserting that four defeats in four tournaments had nothing to do with the decision to part with the affable Australian, other than provide time for him to think about making it. The real reason - lack of communication - had, he claimed, been brewing for longer. \"It sounds simple but you get into a routine and we started never having much contact and it was never like that at the start,\" Federer said. \"Maybe always after two and a half years you think this relationship needs more, and then it's too late to change it.\" The moment of parting had been emotional. Federer said he was sad and Roche surprised, although a moral plus had been that he managed it face to face, unlike his split from Peter Lundgren in 2003, which he had done with a phone call. Federer has apparently not thought about a replacement, nor will he have one for either the French Open or Wimbledon, because \"I am not that kind of person to go from one to the next\". He said: \"I try my best till the end and then I go from there. And that's what I am doing here.\" No1's 2007 record Jan Australian Open Won Beat Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez in final Feb Dubai Won Beat Mikhail Youzhny in final Mar Indian Wells 2nd rd Lost to Guillermo Ca\u00f1as 5-7, 2-6 Mar Miami R16 Lost to Guillermo Ca\u00f1as 6-7, 6-2, 6-7 Apr Monte Carlo Finalist Lost to Rafael Nadal 4-6, 4-6 May Rome R16 Lost to Filippo Volandri 2-6, 4-6"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
